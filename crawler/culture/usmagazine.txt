Feuds are one thing. When it happens between two of music’s biggest stars, it’s a royal rumble. The bad blood between Elton John and Madonna is perhaps one of the most epic in modern pop-culture history.
It all started when the “Rocket Man” singer threw shade at the Queen of Pop in 2004 at the Q Awards, an annual music award show put on by United Kingdom-based Q magazine. John was honored with the Q Classic Songwriting Award, and rocked the music world during his acceptance speech when he questioned Madonna’s nomination for best live act.
“Since when has lip-synching been live?” John said of his former friend at the time. “Sorry about that, but I think everyone who lip-synchs on stage in public when you pay like 75 quid to see them should be shot. Thank you very much. That’s me off her [expletive] Christmas card list, but do I give a toss? No.”
The Material Girl lost to Muse, and her team went on the defense. Spokesperson Liz Rosenberg released a statement that read, "Madonna does not lip-synch nor does she spend her time trashing other artists. She sang every note of her Re-Invention tour live and is not ashamed that she was well paid for her hard work ... Elton John remains on her Christmas card list whether he is nice ... or naughty."
But the eight-time Grammy winner wasn’t done dissing the pop superstar. During an interview with Australia’s Channel 7 on August 5, 2012, John said of Madonna, "She's such a nightmare … Her career is over, I can tell you that. Her tour has been a disaster and it couldn't happen to a bigger [expletive]."
"If Madonna had any common sense, she would have made a record like Ray of Light, stayed away from the dance stuff, and just been a great pop singer and made great pop records, which she does brilliantly. But no, she had to prove that she was like…,” John continued. "And she looks like a [expletive] fairground stripper."
Us Weekly’s Famous Feuds’ Friday episode will feature an in-depth look the strained relationship. The episode will also explore the drama between ex-BFFs Paris Hilton and Nicole Richie. Watch an exclusive sneak peek of the episode above.
Us Weekly's Famous Feuds airs on REELZ Fridays at 9 p.m. ET.

Guys trip! James Corden was joined by famed musical group the Foo Fighters for a head-banging edition of The Late Late Show’s signature series “Carpool Karaoke” on Wednesday, September 20.
Group members Dave Grohl, Taylor Hawkins, Pat Smear, Chris Shiflett, Nate Mendel, Rami Jaffee, William Goldsmith and Franz Stahl all packed into a van along with the 39-year-old late-night host to sing a section of the band’s greatest hits including “All My Life,” “Best Of You” and “Learn To Fly.”
The rockstars, who this week released their ninth studio album, Concrete and Gold, also performed their new single, The Sky Is A Neighborhood, to which the lovable TV personality also sang along. The Brit looked at ease as he lent his vocal support and harmonized with the group’s drummer.
The 13-minute fun-filled clip even featured a moment of nostalgia as Grohl and Mendel recalled the first time they made music together.
"I remember the first time we jammed, I was playing through a karaoke machine in your living room,” Mendel recalled.
"Full circle!" Grohl exclaimed.
Toward the end of the segment, Corden and the performers made a pit stop at a guitar center where the host went on to have a drum-off with Hawkins and Grohl.
"I was wrong," Corden said. "Drumming is more than a feeling."
Before leaving the venue, the musicians and Corden covered Rick Astley‘s ‘Never Gonna Give You Up,’ much like their performance at The O2 in London on Tuesday, September 19.
Watch the clip above to see the the late night host belt out the Foo Fighters’ classic hits and more!

It’s all in the past! Corinne Olympios and DeMario Jackson were spotted during a night out together on Wednesday, September 20, as they headed to dinner at TAO in Hollywood.
The Bachelor in Paradise costars were all smiles outside of the restaurant and when photographers asked if they were dating, Olympios replied, “We’re friends.” She wore form-fitting black trousers, with a baby blue tank top and metallic heels, while Jackson wore a black T-shirt with Frank Ocean lyrics on it from the song “Nikes,” that read: “Said she need a ring like Carmelo.”
In the past few months, the pair have apologized to one another and moved onto having a friendship after the show’s scandal. The reality stars were photographed at SBE's Nightingale Plaza in Los Angeles on August 31, which was the first time they were seen together since the show’s production was halted over the summer. They seemed happy to see each other at the time, and they hugged and posed for some PDA-filled photos.
“We’re friends. We’re hanging out. He picked me up from the airport, we went to dinner. We’re cool. Really cool,” Olympios told ET on September 7, about their initial reunion. "It was really relieving. A lot of my unanswered questions were really answered. There were just a lot of questions I had about why he ran to the press so fast, I was like, ‘We could’ve handled this totally privately.’”
As Us Weekly previously reported, a Bachelor in Paradise producer filed a complaint of alleged sexual misconduct on set in June, after witnessing the pair getting hot and heavy. Olympios told Good Morning America at the time that she had no recollection of the incident after she unintentionally blacked out from a combination of alcohol and medication. Both stars opted not to return to complete the season after a full investigation by Warner Bros. found no evidence of misconduct by any party.

A post shared by Josephine Skriver (@josephineskriver) on Jul 6, 2017 at 8:43am PDT
Skriver, 24, admits that cleanliness is key when it comes to your iPhone photos.
“As a girl, most of us wear makeup, most of us have hairspray, so always clear the lens,” Skriver tells Us Weekly. “Just clear it off because nothing is bigger than my pet peeve of a foggy lens.”
The runway model says you also have to find the right light and “you want to feel the light on your face” and “step into the shadows so it bounces off of you.”
secrets, secrets, secrets 🙊
A post shared by Josephine Skriver (@josephineskriver) on Aug 30, 2017 at 6:17am PDT
Once your lens is clear and your light is just right, make sure you snap your picture from above to get your supermodel selfie.
“Anything from above makes your face more narrow, cheekbones more popping and eyes bigger,” Skriver explains. “Then you try your angle to what you like.”
Skriver will have to get her selfies ready for Shanghai where she will be walking in the upcoming 2017 Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show.
“It’s one of the most diverse shows we've ever done,” Skriver tells Us Weekly. “It’s really cool to be with girls all over the world just to hear their stories and really learn a lot about other people's cultures.”
However, before she hits the runway, the model will be hard at work helping to launch Victoria’s Secret’s new fall fragrance, Love.
“The first time I smelt it, it brought me back to my first kiss,” Skriver explains. “I was in Copenhagen in the fall and it was right before sunrise and you know that crisp air in the morning before the whole world wakes up, it kind of has that.”
To find out Skriver’s workout secrets and how she describes her own personal style, watch the video above!


Love and basketball. For the past 10 years, viewers have had a close look at the Kardashians’ love lives on their hit reality show Keeping Up With the Kardashians on E!. In a new exclusive clip from the Keeping Up With the Kardashians Ten Year Anniversary Special, Khloe Kardashian told the adorable story of how she met her current boyfriend, Tristan Thompson.
In the sneak peek for the Ryan Seacrest-hosted special, the sisters sat down with him to talk about living in front of the cameras for the past decade. Seacrest asked Khloe, 33, about her love life and what attracted her to the kind of guys she has dated throughout her time on the show.
“Is basketball something that you are attracted to? Is there something about basketball players? I don’t want to say you have a type, but you kind of have a type,” Seacrest said.
“I mean, I don’t know what that is but I was put on a blind date with Tristan. That’s how I met Tristan,” the Good American owner revealed. Her mother Kris Jenner and sister Kim Kardashian seemed to be surprised at her reply, and Jenner asked, “Really? Who set you up?”
“Brandon Jennings, who is a basketball player, he is a friend of mine and Malika [Haqq]’s, and he was like, ‘You’re such a good girl, I want to introduce you to someone,’” the Strong Looks Better Naked author said.
❥ իմ սեր ❥ Im ser ❥ All my Love ❥
A post shared by Khloé (@khloekardashian) on Aug 6, 2017 at 1:17pm PDT
Jennings played wingman and brought his friend Tristan along one day, and the pair hit it off automatically. “I was at the Bel-Air Hotel. He came to the dinner. I didn’t want to go on a blind date,” the reality star revealed. “So Brandon kind of ambushed the blind date. So I had a bunch of people, and he brought him and we just connected.”
“It’s a serious relationship,” Khloe said about her romance with the Cleveland Cavaliers player. Her older sister Kourtney then stepped in and confessed that the relationship’s seriousness level is a five out of six.
Kardashian was previously married to NBA star Lamar Odom and also dated Houston Rockets player James Harden after meeting him in 2015.
Catch the Keeping Up with the Kardashians 10 Year Anniversary Special on Sunday, Sept. 24 at 9 p.m. and the season 14 premiere of KUWTK on Sunday, Oct. 1 at 9 p.m. on E!.

Not having it. Jimmy Kimmel is slamming the Republican health care bill again and this time, he is defending himself against those that are dismissing his criticisms because he’s a comedian. The Jimmy Kimmel Live! host used his monologue at the beginning of the show on Wednesday, September 20, to respond to Senator Bill Cassidy, Senator Lindsey Graham, Governor Chris Christie and Fox & Friends’ Brian Kilmeade, after they reacted to his comments from earlier this week on the Graham-Cassidy health care bill.
Kimmel stated on the late-night show on Tuesday, September 19, that the Louisiana senator had “lied” right to his face and “wasn’t very honest,” which caused a reaction from several people. “I’m sorry, he doesn’t understand,” Cassidy said in an interview about the host the day after the Tuesday night show.
“Oh, I get it. I don’t understand because I’m a talk show host,” Kimmel fired back on Wednesday. “Then help me out, which part don’t I understand? Is it the part where you cut $243 billion from federal health care assistance? Am I not understanding the part where states would be allowed to let insurance companies price you out of coverage for having preexisting conditions?”
He then listed a list of health organizations that also oppose the bill, saying, “Which part of that am I not understanding? Or could it be, Senator Cassidy, that the problem is that I do understand and you got caught with you GOPenis out? Is that possible?”
Cassidy made an appearance on the show back in May, and told Kimmel that he was going to have a health care system that was up to the TV host’s standards and would meet the “Kimmel Test.” The senator later introduced an Obamacare repeal bill with cosponsor Senator Lindsey Graham, that Kimmel, 49, did not approve of.
Kilmeade criticized the late-night host on his show Fox & Friends, saying, Kimmel was “pushing” his politics on the rest of the country. Kimmel reacted to that jab by saying that whenever he sees Kilmeade, the Fox anchor kisses his a-- “like a little boy meeting Batman.” Christie said he also disagreed with Kimmel but dismissed his comments against the GOP, saying he is “not a serious person” to which the host said, “I’m not a serious person? I never got my head stuck in a bucket of chicken!”
Kimmel revealed in May, just days before sitting down with Cassidy, that his now 4-month-old son Billy underwent heart surgery shortly after he was born on April 21. He went on to praise the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, for bringing access to health care to people who can't afford it.
The TV host revealed that his son’s condition is the reason why he is so vocal about his belief that people with pre-existing conditions should have access to healthcare.

Let the games begin! Arie Luyendyk Jr. returned to the Bachelor mansion on Wednesday, September 20, to begin filming season 22 of the ABC reality dating series.
Franchise creator Mike Fleiss gave fans a first glimpse of the professional race car driver, 35, looking dapper in a classic black suit during his first night on set. "Guess who's back? Back again. Arie's back. Tell a friend. #TheBachelor #JanuArie," the producer tweeted alongside a photo of Bachelor host Chris Harrison, Luyendyk Jr., ABC executive Robert Mills and himself.
In a follow-up tweet, Fleiss promised that the upcoming season includes a "fantastic group of women," adding that Luyendyk Jr. "has got some tough choices to make" during the first rose ceremony.
Guess who's back? Back again. Arie's back. Tell a friend. #TheBachelor #JanuArie pic.twitter.com/XaooVeuZ6U
Fantastic group of women. @ariejr has got some tough choices to make tonite... #thebachelor
Fans of Bachelorette season 13 runner-up Peter Kraus, who was rumored to be in the running to lead season 22 of The Bachelor, continued to voice their divided opinions in response to Fleiss' tweets. "I bet the girls were pissed to find Not Peter as the bachelor," one disappointed viewer wrote. Another quipped, "What's the return policy?"
However, Kraus, 32, doesn't have any hard feelings toward ABC or Luyendyk Jr. He thanked the network for treating him "with such love and kindness" in a recent Instagram post, which he concluded with a valuable lesson he learned during his time on The Bachelorette: "When you let uncertainty or fear guide your decisions, you risk missing out on what could potentially be the greatest opportunity of a life time. So live dangerously, live without the fear of the unknown, and continue to live and love with a heart that is truly open to anything."
The Bachelor returns to ABC in January 2018.

Tissues, please! Darci Lynne Farmer — like the rest of her family — broke down in tears after she was crowned the season 12 winner of America's Got Talent on Wednesday, September 20.
"I was so overcome with joy, and I was kind of shocked and delirious at that time so I can't remember anything," the 12-year-old told Us Weekly and other reporters following the finale.
"It was waterworks right here on this face," she added. "I was like a water faucet."
Farmer impressed the judges — Simon Cowell, Mel B, Heidi Klum and Howie Mendel — with her ventriloquist skills, which she mixed with comedy and singing.
Farmer was joined by her loved ones on stage after she scored the $1 million prize. "I felt so loved during my AGT journey by all the contestants, and all the staff, my friends and family, and everyone, it just all came out," she said of her emotional reaction.
As for what she will buy with all that money? "I want a pug so bad because I love puppies," she said. "It has been a long time since I had a puppy. I want a pug because they have wrinkles and fat rolls and they are so cute."
Many were rooting for Farmer to win — including Cowell. "I followed what America was saying, trust me. I said about to five people last night you could win. I covered myself. But I do believe with Darci, when I watched it back, she was the one I would say who brought something so few people could do, let alone at that age," he said on Wednesday night.
He continued: "Over the previous years, we’ve had young kids win the show before, and we’ve had a lot of young kids who don’t win the show. It all depends. The public who vote watch this show, they’re not stupid. They know who the talent is. I always say about those shows, you can’t put rules around it. You just say if it’s talent, anyone can enter."

Cheryl Burke is taking some encores. Back on ABC’s Dancing With the Stars (Mondays, 8 p.m.), she’s also reliving her days as a studio owner, replacing now-incarcerated Abby Lee Miller as teacher and choreographer on Lifetime’s Dance Moms (Tuesdays, 9 p.m.). 
Even more, she’s rekindled her 10-year-old romance with actor Matthew Lawrence. It’s the latter that makes the rest possible. “It’s just so important to have someone that just listens to you and tells you, ‘No matter what we’re gonna get through this.'" The San Francisco native takes Us for a spin.
Us: So you’re gunning for your third mirrorball!
CB: It’s my 20th season, so it was a great time to return and my partner is awesome: Terrell Owens. I always love being able to dance with athletes because they just know how to be coached. Football players can actually move pretty fast on their feet.
Us: You’re also coaching the girls from Dance Moms.
CB I had just had a meeting with the executive producers and the weekend after, one called my manager and was like, “Abby walked out and Cheryl would be the perfect replacement.” 
Us: What made you say yes?
CB I love working with kids. I know the goal and how to reach it. They all want to make it in this business and I wanted to tell them that the transition from dancer to the Hollywood spotlight is not easy.
Us: How was it stepping in?
CB It was tough, there were a lot of tears, anger and insecurity. It was shocking to me. I couldn’t believe these beautiful girls that have zero confidence. That’s not the way to live life.
Us: Do you think that’s because of Abby?
CB They said they’d been traumatized by Abby and her teaching methods. That’s a shame because with teenagers it’s so important to mentor them. 
Us: So you’re the good cop?
CB I’m not a yeller. But I am strict. I tell it how it is, especially with the mothers because I come from the original dance mom. She was hard on me, but in the right way.
Us: Did you share your struggles?
CB One hundred percent. I had people body-shaming me when I gained a lot of weight and as a teenager, your body is going to change. To get through it, you need to have great family and friends.
Us: Like Matt, perhaps. How did you reconnect?
CB Ten years ago, it was the wrong timing. Since, we never ran into each other once, but a mutual friend was like, “Oh, Matt says hi.” Then it was an easy text over Christmas and we haven’t stopped seeing each other since. It’s like we never missed a day. It just feels so right.
Us: Thinking marriage?
CB I would love that! We talked about it, so whenever the time is right. Hopefully sooner than later! 
Dancing With The Stars airs Mondays at 8 p.m. on ABC.

Mindy Kaling said goodbye to her show, The Mindy Project, on Wednesday, September 20, after filming wrapped on the sixth and final season of the comedy series.
“Last day,” Kaling, 38, wrote alongside a photo of herself in character as Mindy Lahiri sitting in her office. Following the emotional post, the actress shared a few behind-the-scenes photos of filming from season 1 of the show, which originally aired on Fox before getting picked up by Hulu after three seasons.
Last day.
A post shared by Mindy Kaling (@mindykaling) on Sep 20, 2017 at 8:06am PDT
Kaling, who is currently pregnant with her first child, recently revealed that the show’s final season will touch on the struggles of being a mother. During a panel at the Television Critics Association’s summer press tour,  executive producer Matt Warburton gave details about the plot line. "I think she’s going to learn a little bit more about how to be a good, involved parent,” he said. "We have a really funny episode where Julie Bowen plays a rival mother who thinks that Mindy’s not doing that great of a job.”
Kaling added: [It's] a little bit about mom-shaming and that’s cool. [A] lot those juicy ripped-from-the-blogger-headline storylines.”
The actress also opened up about her pregnancy on the Today show’s September 10 episode. "It’s so unknown to me,” she said at the time. "I have a lot of control over a lot of aspects of my life, and this is one where I’m like, ‘OK, it’s out of my hands,’ which is kind of a fun feeling."
Aside from wrapping up the beloved series, Kaling will also star in the forthcoming Ocean’s Eight film alongside Sandra Bullock, Anne Hathaway, Rihanna, Cate Blanchett, Sarah Paulson and more. “With that group of women, I’ve never felt so unfamous in my life,” Kaling said during a December 2016 appearance on Late Night With Seth Meyers. "Like, I thought I was pretty cool. I have my own show. People think I’m Sandra Bullock’s assistant and they’re like, ‘Get out of the way! We need to bring Sandra her matcha tea.’ I’m like, ‘I’m in a scene with her. I’m not her assistant.’ Then I’m like, ‘OK! Whatever. I’ll give her her matcha tea. Might as well.’"

The old Taylor is alive and well. In a hilarious behind-the-scenes clip for the filming of the “Look What You Made Me Do” video, Taylor Swift came face-to-face with all her former selves — and they had a great time. The video was released on Wednesday, September 20, and it focuses on the scene where the “Shake It Off” singer is on top of "Taylor Mountain" as old versions of herself are trying to climb to the top.
“Okay, this is trippiest thing I’ve ever seen in my life,” Swift, 27, says as she walks onto the set and sees the actors who are playing her.
“Seeing all of them together is the weirdest feeling, but it’s awesome,” she tells the camera about meeting her doppelgangers. “It’s exciting. It’s like, ‘Oh, that’s a phase I went through when I was 16, but like, a girl is wearing it who looks just like me.”
Swift introduced herself to her body doubles, who were wearing iconic outfits the singer has worn throughout her career on red carpets, album covers and in music videos. “We’re having a great time. We’re all just chatting about life. That’s gotta look weird,” she added.
“We’re all, like, creating this pile of people who are trying to get to the top. All of whom happen to be my former selves, which these girls are so wonderful to like, do that,” she said.
Swift also changed into the outfits herself to shoot close-up shots, one in particular where two different versions of herself fight each other, and the video's director Joseph Kahn tells her, “You’re doing a bang up job playing yourself!”
The video for the singer’s first single off her upcoming Reputation album was released on August 27 and has already racked up more than 420 million views on YouTube.
Watch the behind-the-scenes clip to see exactly how the "Taylor Mountain" scene in the “LWYMMD” video was filmed above.

Is she back? Phaedra Parks parted ways with The Real Housewives of Atlanta after the shocking reunion episode that aired on May 7, but a source has confirmed to Us Weekly that reports that she is asking to come back for season 10 of Bravo’s hit show are false.
A source told Us that the rumors are “not true" and also confirmed that she hasn’t filmed anything for the tenth season — so far.
“Phaedra has been talking to some of the women of RHOA again but has not filmed any scenes so far,” another source told Us. “They are still filming so anything could happen and there is room for a cameo but she has not returned and obviously still isn’t part of the cast.”
Bravo premiered the new trailer for the upcoming season on Tuesday, September 19, and Parks is noticeably absent from the clips. In one scene, Kim Zolciak and Porsha Williams are holding hands and Williams asks her, “Are you my new Frack?” since Williams and Parks used to be referred to as "Frick and Frack."
As Us Weekly previously reported, the 43-year-old attorney wasn't asked to return after starring on seven seasons of the hit reality show. “Phaedra is not coming back as of now,” a source told Us in May. “Bravo is not planning to ask her back.”
Andy Cohen recently opened up about Parks’ exit from the series, saying that her departure was the result of her being caught in a “megawatt lie” during the reunion. 
"The question that we look at now with Phaedra is, when the reunion ended, none of the other women wanted to have anything to do with her. So that's what you have to look at," Cohen told E! in May. "How do you shoot a show about a group of friends when no one is speaking to one of the friends?"
Costar Sheree Whitfield also told Us Weekly in May that it’s unlikely the women will forgive Parks for spreading a rumor that fellow castmate, Kandi Burruss, and her husband, Todd Tucker, were planning to drug Porsha Williams and take her home.
“I don't know, it's so hard right now. It's hard to establish trust with someone like that because, for me, it seemed that she showed no remorse for what she did and for her actions,” Whitfield told Us. “I think it will be hard for any of the women to forgive.”
“I never want to take money out of anyone's pockets and that's not who I am, but in this instance, it's hard to say,” the reality star added.
RHOA returns to Bravo for season 10 on Sunday, November 5 at 8 p.m. ET.

They are making their grand return! James Cameron revealed that both Arnold Schwarzenegger and Linda Hamilton will be returning to The Terminator franchise — and it’s a long time coming.
“As meaningful as she was to gender and action stars everywhere back then, it’s going to make a huge statement to have that seasoned carrier that she’s become return,” Cameron, 63, told The Hollywood Reporter on Tuesday, September 19, of Hamilton’s iconic role as Sarah Connor. “There are 50-year-old, 60-year-old guys out there killing bad guys, but there isn’t an example of that for women.”
Franchise alum Schwarzenegger is also set to star in the forthcoming sixth Terminator installment, which will serve as a sequel to 1991’s Terminator 2: Judgement Day.
Cameron, who has not been involved in the franchise since Judgement Day, also announced his plan to introduce several new younger characters to his futuristic world of robots and machines.
“We’re starting a search for an 18-something woman to be the new centerpiece for the story,” the Titanic director continued. “We still fold time. We will have characters from the future and the present. There will be mostly new characters, but we’ll have Arnold and Linda’s characters to anchor it.”
The Oscar winner recently spoke out about the importance of Hamilton’s character. “Sarah Connor was not a beauty icon. She was strong, she was troubled, she was a terrible mother and she earned the respect of the audience through pure grit,” the Avatar director told The Guardian in August. “And to me, [the benefit of characters like Sarah] is so obvious. I mean, half the audience is female.”

Sterling K. Brown's acceptance speech at the 2017 Emmy Awards on Sunday, September 17, was unceremoniously cut short due to the broadcast's time constraints. Now, NBC has given him a chance to finish.
The network took out a full-page ad in the latest issue of The Hollywood Reporter to allow the actor, 41, to share his powerful message in its entirety. While accepting the award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series for his role on This Is Us, Brown tried to fight through the pesky music to no avail. He even called out the show's producers before exiting the stage, saying, "No one else got that loud music."
Later in the evening, Brown — who made history as the first black actor to win in the category since Homicide: Life on the Street's Andre Braugher in 1998 — was given a chance to finish his speech backstage in the press room.
The People v. O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story actor's This Is Us costars weren't too thrilled about him being cut off either. "I think it's unfortunate," Chrissy Metz told Us at the Fox afterparty. Susan Kelechi Watson, Sterling's onscreen wife, added, "The thing about Sterling is that whether the time runs out or not, the brotha has something to say and he's gonna say it. So he took his space and he took his time and I love it."
Read Brown's full speech below!
Before anything like this happened for your boy, I was a fan. First, last and always, a fan. So, my fellow nominees — I'm a fan. I love y'all. This one right here, like, this one right here, when I think about it ... like, Walter White held this joint! Dick Whitman held this joint! I may have lost some of y'all, but, you know, Google it. And 19 years ago, Detective Frank Pembleton held this joint, as impeccably played by Andre Braugher. I just want to say, Mr. Braugher, whether it's at Stanford University or on this Emmy stage, it is my supreme honor to follow in your footsteps.
I want to thank Bob Greenblatt, Jennifer Salke at NBC for your support from the beginning. I want to thank Dana Walden and Gary Newman and everyone at 20th Century Fox for keeping a brother gainfully employed. I appreciate that. I want to thank my cast — Milo, Mandy, Justin, Chrissy — you are the best white TV family that a brother has ever had; better than Mr. Drummond, better than them white folks that raised Webster. I love you. Susan Kelechi Watson, it is my pleasure to rep black love with you, sister. Let's keep doing it like Martin and Gina. Ron Cephas Jones, you just have to show up and the work is already there, brother. Thank you so much for embodying the presence which is never an absence. I love you.
I wanted to thank our writers. A show doesn't get seven acting nominations without some impeccable, beautiful, thoughtful writing. You guys are our life's blood, so I want to thank you so much. To our producers and directors, in particular, John Requa, Glenn Ficarra and the crazy cool Ken Olin. I thank you for your guidance and friendship. And I wanted to thank Dan Fogelman — he is the Hebrew hammer with which our house is built. He makes me laugh and cry in equal parts and keeps me coming back for me, and in his own little small special way he's not trying to make America great again, he's trying to make it the best that it's ever been, and I love him for taking me on this journey with him. I wanted to thank my manager of 17 years, Jennifer Wiley-Stockton. We've been doing this for a long time, and it feels like we're just getting started. I can't wait to see what's next.
And to my wife — they cut me off before I got to thank my wife, man! Ryan Michelle Bathe, you're everything. You make my life worth living and you gave me two of the most beautiful things that God has ever put on this planet: my sons. Andrew John Sterling Brown, Amaré Michael Ryan Christian Brown, your daddy loves you with the strength of 1,000 suns. I'll see you Monday after work. Love you. Thank you.

Bellamy Young is upset that Scandal is coming to an end — just like the rest of Us. The actress, who plays Mellie Grant on the ABC political drama, that she’s actually spoken to her therapist about the season 7 series finale.
“I'm already in therapy,” Young, 47, exclusively told Us at the National Women’s History Museum’s 6th Annual Women Making History Awards in Beverly Hills on Saturday, September 16. “It's a big transition.”
The Shonda Rhimes-created show will kick off its final episodes next month. Young says the cast is “technically” on episode 5 right now and they are “trying to really savor every moment.”
“We’re sad,” she told Us. “We always have fun, there's a lot of laughing, bantering, and this year it was just a poignancy to it. So we just dig in deep and look into each other’s eyes and know, ‘Oh this is the last time that we’ll get to do this.’”
“We get teary at every table read,” she continued. “It just moves the ball one yard closer to the field goal. It's getting incrementally closer to being over. But you also wrap up sets, you tie up storylines, and there are all a thousand little goodbyes.”
As for what’s to come for Mellie and Kerry Washington’s Olivia Pope? “I just love the two of them in power together. Because I feel like that's really what the story is. I love that there's so much about where Olivia's mind is that Mellie has no idea. So there's a lot of room for disaster but there's also a lot of room for sisterhood and triumph,” she said. “I think Mellie was born to be president. She is going to be a great president. It’s just what obstacles Shonda decides to throw in her path.”
Scandal returns on Thursday, October 5, on ABC at 9 p.m. ET.

Jorge would be proud! Forget the love triangles and scallop fingers — the biggest OMG moment from Bachelor in Paradise this season went to Wells Adams and Danielle Maltby.
The good friends, who once went on a date years ago, shared a surprising kiss during season 4. Wells, who was the bartender this time around, wanted the fellow Nashville resident to experience some romance before she went home. The sweet gesture, however, just left viewers wanting more.
“I think it’s very flattering that people are so interested in our little relationship considering it was 15 seconds really at the end of an episode, before [she went] to Africa,” Adams exclusively told Us Weekly at the 7th annual American Humane Hero Dog Awards in Beverly Hills on Saturday, September 16. “I think ABC did a good job of compounding the interest by not addressing it at the after-show.”
The pair have known each other since 2010. Since the season wrapped, they’ve been featured on each other’s social media accounts, but have remained coy about what the future may hold.
“We are just friends right now,” the radio DJ added to Us. “If things progress romantically, we’re going to take our time with that and not worry about the show or Twitter or anything like that trying to make us something that we’re not ready to be.”
What’s surprised Adams the most is how many people were hoping for such an intimate moment between them.
“I knew always I wanted to make out with her because she’s gorgeous and awesome, and one of my friends. But she’s not part of my friend group, she’s part of my inner circle of friends. So in Nashville I think it was just too weird. But when we were there, I was like this might be my shot to see if I lay one on her. It was a long time coming for me,” he said. “Then afterwards, she kind of echoed the same thing. I didn’t realize at the time everyone was like, ‘This is totally a Jim and Pam situation’ [from The Office]. They were all rooting for it. I had no idea at all.”

Jimmy Kimmel slammed the Republican health care bill and Louisiana Senator Bill Cassidy during his late-night show on Tuesday, September 19.
Cassidy appeared on the ABC show in May, at the time telling Kimmel, 49, that he was going to have a health care system that met the "Kimmel Test," but later introduced an Obamacare repeal bill.
Kimmel skewered Cassidy on Tuesday, stating that the senator "lied right" to his face and "wasn't very honest."
"He got a lot of credit and attention for coming off like a rare, reasonable voice in the Republican Party when it came to healthcare, for something that he called the Jimmy Kimmel test," he said.
Days before sitting down with Cassidy, Kimmel revealed that his now 4-month-old son Billy underwent heart surgery shortly after he was born on April 21. He went on to praise the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, for bringing access to health care to people who can't afford it.
"Before you post a nasty Facebook message saying I’m politicizing my son’s health problems, I want you to know: I am politicizing my son’s health problems because I have to," Kimmel said on Tuesday night. "My family has health insurance we don’t have to worry about this, but other people do. So, you can shove your disgusting comments where your doctor won’t be giving you a prostate exam once they take your health care benefits away."

Devon Sawa appeared in a string of beloved coming-of-age movies, starred in a hit thriller and was a '90s teen heartthrob, but at the age of 25 he decided to  say goodbye to Hollywood. The actor opened up about his decision to leave — and what drew him back — in an exclusive interview with Us Weekly.
"At 25 years old I stepped away from the business for five years and most of the time didn't know whether I was going to come back or not," Sawa, 39, tells Us. "I had done a series of four or five indie movies that I wasn't necessarily proud of. Some were horror movies. After Final Destination everybody wanted me to do horror movies and some weren't as good as others. I was just burnt out."
Sawa had been working since he was 11 — and he only returned by chance. "I was brought back into the business by accident. Somebody at my agency didn't get the memo that I quit and sent me an audition and I put myself on tape and that was it," the Casper star explains to Us. "I didn't get it. It was for the Max Payne movie with Mark Wahlberg. But I did really well and the casting director wanted to meet me and I did. I thought, 'You know what, this is what I love. This is what I really want to do.' So I don't know why I stepped away in the first place."
He adds: “I think if somebody hadn't had sent me that audition I think that I may still be out of it. I was happy what I was doing but I'm happier now. I'm happier back doing what I really love.”
And right now, Dawa is focused on the ABC drama Somewhere Between, which also stars Paula Patton. He plays Nico Jackson, a former cop turned private investigator who is given the chance to go back and change a tragic event in his life.
“The writing drew me to it. I read the first script and I was looking for something different. I was just about to go into pilot season and do that whole craziness. This came out before it and I read it and the last few pages of the first script I was hooked. It was that thing I was looking for. The show with the cliffhangers that keep you on your toes,” Sawa tells Us. “This particular role I spent a lot of time with the dialogue. I went to Vancouver and walked by myself looking like a complete nut ball [getting into character]. That was kind of the process.”
For more, read the rest of his Q&A below:
US: What was it like working with Paula?
DS: Great! She's very dedicated to the role. From the day I met her she had a million ideas and she liked to discuss things and she really got into it. She had her headphones on in-between scenes. She was emotionally there and she was very interesting to work with. She's fun.
US: Do you strategically try to take roles that are different than what people are used to seeing you in?
DS: Yea, I take roles now that I just want to do. I don't really think about where they are going to take me. I just want to do stuff that I want to do. I just got a movie that I'm going to start shooting in a couple of weeks that I can't really talk about but I'm giddy because if I told myself at 12 years old that I was going to do this movie I would have lost my shit. Lost my mind. I have a huge fight scene with one of my childhood idol. It's going to be amazing.
US: What's a well-known role that you went for but didn't get?
DS: The Tobey Maguire Spider-Man. I met with Sam Raimi and I was one of the last few guys and of course Tobey got it and was phenomenal in it. I would have loved to have gotten that. I think that's the biggest one.
US: What are three must-haves you need in your trailer?
DS: I'm not that guy! I just need a place that's a little quiet before I go in and other than that I don't have anything that I need. I'm not the Skittles with no red in a bowl or sparkling water kind of guy.
Somewhere Between airs Tuesdays on ABC at 10 p.m. ET.

Back to the beginning. The Kardashian clan epically recreated the first Keeping Up With the Kardashians opening credits for their 10th anniversary season.
“No matter how far they go, they never go alone,” flashes across the screen in crisp white letters as the reality family matriarch, Kris Jenner, takes a helicopter ride over Los Angeles. “Keep it Kardashian.”
The camera then pans over Kourtney, who is lounging poolside in a sexy pink bikini and metallic silver frames.
Next, Khloe flaunts her fit physique while working on her fitness in the gym.
Flash forward to Kendall, whose prepping for a runway fashion show.
Elsewhere, Kylie zooms off in an orange Lamborghini after receiving a speeding ticket.
The E! personalities finally reunite on a building grass top, a nod to their first season’s intro. “OK guys, here we go,” Kris says while placing her daughters. “Where’s Kim?”
In the legendary 2007 opener, the Selfish author, 36, is fashionably late to the family photo shoot. So where is the social media mogul? Having a pre-shoot glam session of course!
Fans then see the KKW beauty founder being personally styled in a rhinestoned bodysuit.
“Mom, she’s always late,” Khloe explains, just as she did in the original intro. “No, I’m here!” Kim announces as she prances to her family and poses front and center. Kylie then lets go of the backdrop, and low and behold, the clan is standing right in front of their former Hidden Hills pad where the show began. The OG jingle plays in the background as Kris declares, “And we’re done! Bye everybody.”
Keeping Up With the Kardashian season 14 premieres on E! on Sunday, October 1, at 9 p.m. ET.

How rude! Chances are slim that Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen will (finally) make a surprise cameo on Netflix's Fuller House. Full House creator Jeff Franklin exclusively told Us Weekly that he's stopped bringing up the topic to the famous twins.
"I’ve stopped asking, really I kind of gave up," he told Us at the show's Paleyfest panel in Beverly Hills. "But when somebody rings a doorbell, the girls yell, 'It’s always open!' on the show so that’s kind of how we feel about the Olsen twins. The door is open."
"But I think we’ve gotten enough no's," he continued. "We’re kind of done asking. But who knows? You never know in life. Who thought this whole thing would happen?"
Fuller House stars Candace Cameron Bure, Jodie Sweetin and Andrea Barber. Its third season is set to premiere on Friday, September 22, just days after the cast celebrated the original show's 30th anniversary.
"It's pretty crazy. It’s pretty special really," Franklin told Us of the milestone. "I’m having a lot of fun with these people that I love so much. And to get to work with them again is ridiculous and it’s a whole new thing because they were all little kids when we worked together the first time. And now they are amazing women. It’s pretty cool. I feel like I raised them, even though I know I didn’t, I know that I did. I wrote enough dad lectures for them. I’m going to hang onto that."
"They [got a lot of hugs from Danny Tanner]," he added. "They got a lot of hugs from me too."

That face, though! Big Brother's Kevin Schlehuber has finally explained the origin of his funny mirror expressions. During the CBS series, fans would often watch the 56-year-old Boston native pose and even comb his hair with his tooth brush!
"The face in the mirror is from the 70s and a joke, and my brothers would make fun of me," he exclusively tells Us Weekly. "In the 70s I would have a hairbrush all the time, we had longer hair then. I would make faces in the mirror. Now they call it selfies. I was before that."
"I would joke with Josh [Martinez] about it," he adds of his former houseguest. "It’s not something I try to hide. With my routine, I didn’t sleep much. I would try to just figure out what was happening that day, be prepared, have fun and enjoy myself. I missed my family a lot. But I hope I did the best I could."
Despite getting evicted, Schlehuber landed in the final four — and even snagged $25,000 in the first temptation competition of the season. He sometimes fought with Martinez and Alex Ow, but he did create a special bond with Ramses Soto. In fact, the 21-year-old still plans on accepting Schlehuber's invitation to Thanksgiving dinner.
"He don’t have to bring nothing. He’s only 21. He can come to my house, have fun. My kids will take him to the mall. He’ll have fun," the stay-at-home dad tells Us. "He’ll get to know the kind of person I am, see a big family, and enjoy himself. I invited Josh, Paul [Abrahamian], Mark [Jansen], anyone who wants to come. I have a big family, family is a big deal. He can bring the bottle of wine I told him was in storage that was never there! He can bring wine and I’ll do everything else."
For more, read the rest of his Q&A below:
US: If you won Head of Household who would you have put up?
KS: I would have put up Cody because he was such a strong player, and Alex for the same reason. It’s a respect thing, it’s not a dislike. They were the best players and you want to take them out. Only out of respect.
US: What is your biggest regret in the house?
KS: Trusting some people. I trusted Matt in the pool, I felt bad, I thought he was leaving, I told him I won the money and he turned on me. I wouldn’t have done that. My argument with Josh was about the same thing. I should have said nothing to nobody. That’s why I took the chalice temptation, if I won that, I could say why would I take $27 if I won’t $25,000. I was basically on my own, and I think I did well.
US: Do you think the cast will be mad at you for taking the $25,000?
KS: I don’t think anyone would be mad. We didn’t know what was going on. It was a temptation. It brought Paul in, which was entertaining. I didn’t know I won initially, they had to tell me. Ii don’t think anyone would be upset when they find out. It’s a game. I was surprised I won.
Big Brother’s two-hour season finale airs on CBS on Wednesday, September 20, at 8 p.m. ET.

Frankie Muniz revealed on the season 25 premiere of Dancing With the Stars on Monday, September 18, that he broke his back in an accident during his time as a professional race car driver.
"I had a crash and broke my back and injured my hands and ribs," the Malcolm in the Middle alum, 31, told his pro partner Witney Carson during rehearsals. Despite his previous injuries, Muniz and Carson, 23, earned one of the highest scores of the night — a 19 out of 30 — for their first dance, a foxtrot to Harry Styles' "Sign of the Times."
"It just felt so good to be done," Muniz told Us Weekly after the show. "I thought it went really well. I don't know. I'm so happy, I really am."
The Agent Cody Banks star also opened up to Us about how he's powering through his injuries in the ballroom. "I broke my ribs, I broke my back, ankle. I tore my meniscus two months ago. I'm a walking disaster," he quipped. "I'm taking this so seriously. I literally am dedicated to icing, sauna, whatever I can to heal so I'm ready for the next day."
Prior to Monday's premiere, Muniz questioned his dancing abilities. "I was literally such a nervous wreck," he told Us. "I can't even explain to you how bad it was. ... But I want to do well. I didn't know that I would love dancing as much as I do, but I do. I feel like I can improve so much with what [Carson] has taught me."
The actor received a boost of confidence from some of his former Malcom in the Middle costars, including his onscreen parents, Bryan Cranston and Jane Kaczmarek. "Everyone has been so supportive," Muniz told Us. "All my friends, cast members, everyone has been contacting me and saying they're rooting for me. So hopefully they vote! Hopefully Bryan and Jane are going to come out. It just depends on ... if we make it later [in the competition]. If people want to see them in the ballroom, they've got to vote for us!"
Dancing With the Stars airs on ABC Mondays at 8 p.m. ET.

All up in his business! Barbara Corcoran appeared to grab her Dancing With the Stars pro partner Keo Motsepe's crotch on the season 25 premiere on Monday, September 18.
Just before receiving their scores from judges Carrie Ann Inaba, Len Goodman and Bruno Tonioli, the Shark Tank star, 68, placed her left hand near the 27-year-old dancer's nether regions, where it visibly remained for at least 20 seconds. Many viewers took to social media to poke fun at the handsy moment, but Corcoran meant no harm.
"There was no crotch grab," she exclusively told Us Weekly after the show. "I just happened to land my hand on that very important part. And then I felt something in the way, and I moved away."
After all, Corcoran has been married to former FBI agent Bill Higgins for 28 years. The secret to their union? "Being open to new possibilities," she told Us.
Though Higgins was unable to attend the premiere to cheer on his wife, she joked that she doesn't want him to get in the way of her budding partnership with Motsepe. "I didn't want him to interfere in the relationship at the get-go," she quipped. "These things need time to blossom. ... I asked my husband to move to the guest room and I'm giving [Motsepe] comfortable accommodations."
The South Africa native was taken aback by the businesswoman's generosity, prompting her to take it one step further. "I'll do anything for Keo. All the things I used to do for my husband 22 years ago, I'm going to be doing to Keo now," she continued as Motsepe responded, "I'm going to start writing my list now."
Corcoran didn't have a problem with that. "Make your list, baby," she said. "Whatever you want. No limit. You want an Aston Martin? You want a home in Malibu? Rolex watches? Don't worry about it."
After all, the TV personality certainly isn't shy. While rehearsing last week for the DWTS premiere, she exclusively told Us, "I feel like I lose my virginity every day in practice. Again and again and again and again."

Dancing With the Stars kicked off its 25th season (yes, 25th!) with plenty of sparkle, shine and tears. On the Monday, September 18 episode, the new pack of Mirrorball hopefuls performed their first dances for the panel of three judges: Carrie Ann Inaba, Bruno Tonioli, and Len Goodman. Erin Andrews was back to conduct the post-performance interviews, and had her own stumbles along the way. Here’s how it all went down.
The Good
Vanessa Lachey decided to do the show because she spends all her time doing things for her husband (who is also competing) and her kids and she wanted something for herself. The judges loved her cha cha with partner Maksim Chmerkovskiy and awarded her a solid 21.
On their heels were Nikki Bella and Artem Chigvintsev, who performed a tango that ended with her body slamming him into the ground. Len praised their body contact but urged her to stop looking at the floor.
Malcolm in the Middle alum Frankie Muniz was all giggles while practicing with Witney Carson. Even though he grew up in show business, he’s clearly still shy and hoping that being on the show will help him come out of his shell. They brought some solid chemistry to their foxtrot that the judges adored and ended with a 19, which was pretty great considering what little confidence Frankie seemed to have in his dance skills.
Victoria Arlen is a former athlete-turned-journalist who was paralyzed for 10 years but can walk now – though she has zero feeling in her legs. Val Chmerkovskiy said she’s the closest thing he’s ever seen to a miracle and their cha cha wowed the judges and audience. Carrie Ann was in tears as she called it “one of the most joyous performances” she had ever seen. They too received a 19.
The Bad
Terrell Owens and Cheryl Burke performed the first dance of the season. T.O. said he’s here to show the world that he’s not as arrogant as he seems on the football field. Cheryl wants to prove that she still has it 20 seasons in. Their cha cha actually looked fine, but Len scolded Terrell for heel leads. Erin confused the comment as a good thing. The judges gave him a score of 15.
Next came Debbie Gibson and Alan Bersten. He was born in 1994, so he doesn’t really understand her whole ‘80s music queen vibe. He helped her practice through her pain from Lyme disease to perform a foxtrot that was well received by the judges and landed them a few points ahead of Terrell and Cheryl at 17.
The Needs Real Improvement
Property Brothers star Drew Scott hopes that being on the show will help get him ready to dance at his wedding. He and Emma Slater performed a foxtrot that had the judges pretty speechless – but not in a good way. Len politely said that he is a “fixer-upper” and the judges gave him a 16 (which actually seemed pretty generous).
Barbara Corcoran turns businesses to gold, but her salsa with Keo Motsepe didn’t shine the way they’d hoped. Barbara had fun with the routine, which involved dancing to a Ludacris song while money rained down on them. The judges gave them a 14.
The Best
Two clear stars of the night were Lindsay Arnold and Jordan Fisher. He’s fresh off a stint in Hamilton, which means he’s used to live performing (and live performing that involves dancing). Lindsay was psyched to have a partner who was her age for once, but she was probably even more psyched when she saw just how good Jordan was going to be. Their tango blew away the judges, who rewarded them with a 22, the highest score of the night.
Mark Ballas has returned after a year off from the show and is paired with electronic violinist Lindsey Stirling. It turns out, in addition to playing the violin, Lindsey can dance! Len admitted he’d expected her to be good at the lyrical dances, but said she’d blown him away with their “crisp” and “clean” cha cha. He declared it the dance of the night – but technically they tied with Jordan and Lindsay.
Everyone Else
Pretty Little Liars alum Sasha Pieterse decided to come on Dancing With the Stars to get in shape for her wedding. Her parents were professional ballroom dancers, but her dancing skills were obviously not at a pro-level (at least not yet!). Paired with Gleb Savchenko, she shimmied her way through a cha cha that the judges liked a lot. Carrie Ann said Sasha owned it and the judges gave her a score of 18.
Nick Lachey wants everyone to know that yes, he was in a boy band, but he was in 98 Degrees, and they were the “non-dancing boy band.” This means he cannot dance. Paired with Peta Murgatroyd, he struggled through a cha cha. Len complimented him on “going for it” and not holding back, but admitted the dance moves needed some work. They ended up with a solid 18 and then Erin shared a video interview from 2009 where he said he would never be on the show.
Former LA Laker Derek Fisher and his partner, Sharna Burgess, were determined to break the track record of basketball players on Dancing With the Stars. (ICYMI, they haven’t done very well.) Derek’s mom is a mega-fan of the show who freaked out when she found out he was going to be on it. Sharna and Derek performed a salsa that Bruno said needed better hip action. They ended up with a solid 18, though.

Taken again! Jenelle Evans lost her custody case against her mom during the Monday, September 18, episode of Teen Mom 2. Briana DeJesus also found out her baby daddy Luis will miss the birth of their child. Oh, and Chelsea Houska’s daughter showed her love for her stepdad, Cole DeBoer, and dissed her father, Adam Lind. The MTV reality show was crazy this week — here’s our rundown of the 5 biggest moments from the episode.
Jenelle’s Mom Gets Permanent Custody
Jenelle lost her custody battle to Barbara Evans, but she did get solid visitation days with her son Jace. Barbara said the main reason is that Jace is “scared to death” of Jenelle’s fiancé, David Eason, who had some choice words to say about his mother-in-law to be.
“It takes one of the lowest, most selfish pieces of s--t in the world to do what she does. That’s why I hate her so f--king much,” David said.
Jenelle was obviously upset but tried to look on the bright side of having court-mandated visitation days. She also said her mom would not be invited to her wedding, and she’d make sure to have it on a weekend when she has Jace.
“I don’t consider her as my mom anymore,” Jenelle said. “She’s completely ruined our relationship.”
Briana’s Baby Daddy Will Miss the Birth!
As if Briana’s disastrous baby shower wasn’t stressful enough, her ex-boyfriend and future co-parent dropped yet another bomb on her. He was going to miss the birth of their child in order to go to school to be a truck driver. Briana was in shock but said if it’s what he has to do to care for their child then he should go for it.
“How are you a man and you can’t provide for your kid — how can you live with yourself?” Briana later told her family about her ex. She was also angry he waited until the end of her pregnancy to start going to school for truck driving in the first place, and rightfully so.
Leah Goes on a Date
Leah Messer decided to get on Bumble because she hadn’t gone on a date since her divorce from Jeremy Calvert. She was anxious at first because she has kids and didn’t want to bring a stranger into their lives, but they were pretty supportive of their mommy getting back out there.
“Go and get a boyfriend,” her daughter Addie said.
However, the date was painfully awkward. They barely talked and having the cameras there didn’t help.
“It was so awkward,” Leah said afterward with a laugh. “When you know, you know and that’s a no.”
When her suitor asked her for a second date, she said she’d text him. Jokingly, she told the producer she would be texting him no. At least she tried!
Chelsea’s Daughter Loves Her Stepdad
For Father’s Day, Chelsea’s daughter Aubree had to go to her real dad’s house and she wasn’t excited about it because all he does is “sleep.” Chelsea was upset too, because Cole loves hanging out with Aubree and was “bummed” she had to go to Adam’s house.
“If he’s just going to sleep and not do anything with you on Father’s Day then you should just come home because I know someone who’d love to something with you on Father’s Day,” Chelsea told her daughter.
Once Aubree came home, she showed her mom an “All About My Dad” worksheet she filled out at church. To Chelsea’s surprise, Aubree had filled out the paper about Cole, not Adam, and knew all of his favorite things. It was really heartwarming!
Kailyn Is Headed Back to Court
Kailyn Lowry’s ex Jo Rivera decided to serve her papers to fight for 50-50 custody of their son. She was really upset about it and thought he was doing it to prevent her from moving away from him.
“Seeing Jo was stressful but now I have to focus on my graduation,” Kailyn said. The mom-to-be is finally graduating and might have to move to find a job in her field. If that becomes the case, both of her exes will definitely freak out!

In life, there is one constant Chris Harrison can always guarantee Us: this will be the most dramatic season in Bachelor history.
At last, he came through on his promise. During season 4 of Bachelor in Paradise, production halted after a sexual misconduct claim, fan-favorite Amanda Stanton accused boyfriend Robby Hayes of cheating and could-have-been-the-next-Bachelor Dean Unglert lost his immortal status after simultaneously dating — and stringing along — Kristina Schulman and Danielle Lombard.
“Dean is the kind of person who changes his mind every couple of days, maybe even every couple of hours,” Lombard exclusively tells Us Weekly of his flip-flopping. “He doesn’t really know what he wants.”
At Mexico’s Playa Escondida resort, he began romancing Russia native Schulman, only to drop her for the L.A.-based Lombard … and then run back to Schulman. Then back to Lombard. Then Schulman again? (We lost track, too.) And though he finally cut ties with Schulman to pursue Lombard, he ultimately backed out of his choice, proclaiming his love for Schulman on the on the soapy spinoff’s September 11 finale. 
“When I heard that I was just like, ‘You know what? You still have a lot of stuff to figure out,’” the single stunner, dubbed “DLo,” explains. “We had talked about doing things in the future together and had made plans to hang out, so it was surprising he had changed his mind.”
Now, for the first time, the badass business owner shares her side of the dramatic journey with Us.
Us Weekly: Why did you decide to go on Paradise?
Danielle Lombard: The way the producers made it seem like there was greater opportunity to meet someone that you could have a relationship with outside of the show. I was honestly hesitant to do Paradise because of the stigma it has of it being like spring break and everyone is hooking up. But everyone I talked to that did the show, whether they had a great edit or not, said it was an incredible experience. 
Us: Were you already in Mexico when production halted?
DL: Yes, I was actually stuck in my hotel room for five days. It was pretty insane. I tried to do whatever I could to get out of the room and have some human interaction. The producers actually let me go to the gym and the spa, which was really nice. I would just spend hours there.
Us: How did they tell you about the situation?
DL: One of the executive producers said an incident occurred between two cast members and there was a complaint filed by a third party. Everything was very vague. I assumed maybe a stalker or a fan had gotten on set and caused a controversy. You wouldn’t guess that something like this would happen. People have hooked up on the show and it’s been filmed. We have to question the reason why producers felt it was necessary to file a claim for sexual misconduct.
I've always been criticized and ridiculed for my looks. Making me work ten times harder to prove that my success comes from my ethics and not my physical appearance. I've held several jobs at once, bought my first car when I was 17, and opened my first business at 23 years old. It's heartbreaking and disappointing to see how my relationship was depicted as something only surface level. Dean and I's connection was so much deeper. Call us kindred spirits or free souls...our outlook on life and love was similar (or so I thought). Which is why we continued a relationship after the show. However, just because I am looking for someone to "have fun with", explore the world, and try new things, does not mean that I don't want monogamy. Marriage is something that will happen when the right person comes into my life but I am not placing a time constraint on that. We have a tendency to become defensive when we see someone physically in pain, but just because they never showed me crying or being upset doesn't mean that I wasn't. This show was one of the most challenging, emotionally trying experiences I have endured. Looking back, I never spoke negatively about anyone else. I never told Dean how he should feel or who he should choose. I wouldn't change anything, all I can do is learn from it and move forward. There are so many other things that we can be investing our time and energy into - things that can improve and change the world. So please be respectful towards everyone ❤️ Spread more love, less hate.

Us: How did you feel about going home without a chance to step on the beach?
DL: I was really disappointed. They tried to stay optimistic and said if the investigation closed they would hopefully resume filming. They initially had told me that I could continue to stay in the hotel until they figured things out but, at that point, I didn’t want to be in a hotel room for five more days. Jasmine [Goode], Raven [Gates] and Alexis [Waters] and I were eating our feelings. We were carb loading with pizza and pasta.
Us: Were you hesitant to come back once the investigation was completed?
DL: I was excited for another opportunity. We had all planned a trip to Vegas for Jasmine’s 30th birthday and were really excited to go. I think it was only two or three days before the trip that they called us. Production was pretty adamant about having us back. I told them, “I’m not flying back if I’m going to be in a hotel room for another five days!”
Us: When you got to Paradise, did you know about Dean and Kristina’s romance?
DL: I had no idea. During the break, my focus wasn’t on who was in a relationship because I really thought it was over. I saw a Snapchat of Kristina and Dean together and I heard they were hanging out after the show but I didn’t know the extent of everything.
Us: Did you go into the show with your mind set on Dean?
DL: No, it wasn’t like Dean was my only option and I was only pursuing him. Ben Z and I actually had a very nice time together. I knew him before the show because he’s one of Jasmine’s good friends. In Paradise, I was trying to see if we had a connection. I think he’s a great person, but I just didn’t feel the chemistry with him. It’s funny because they just don’t show that!
Us: Did Dean lead you to believe his relationship with Kristina wasn’t serious?
DL: When I sat down and talked to the girls, I wanted them to tell me who they liked. I wanted them to speak up the way Jasmine did to Christen [Whitney] like, ”No, I really like this guy. Don’t go after him or I’ll kill you.” Whether we’re friends or not, if someone says that to me I would go find someone else. When I talked to Dean, he told me he and Kristina did hang out during the break but that he wanted to pump the brakes. He wanted to date other people and had encouraged her to do the same thing. And when I talked to Kristina, she said that they weren’t in a relationship either. I figured I would spend time with him and if there wasn’t a connection, at least I would know and I could try and pursue another relationship. 
Us: How would you describe your connection with Dean?
DL: We’re both very light-hearted people. I think that was one of the main differences between my relationship with him versus Kristina’s. He was just someone that I felt super comfortable with. We laugh all the time and we’re very smiley people. I just felt like we had this light-hearted connection where we just wanted to have fun. We didn’t want to put pressure on ourselves with the thought of getting engaged at the end of this. We just wanted to get to know each other in a more relaxed setting.
Us: What was your reaction when he said he wanted to leave separately?
DL: I knew the situation between me, Kristina and him caused a lot of stress. I think in the back of my mind I knew it was a possibility that he would want to leave separately. It was still hard for me to hear, though. I was like, “If he’s having doubts, I don’t want to get involved with someone like that. I rather he tell me now so we can move on separately.” But that’s not what happened afterwards. 
Us: So what did happen?
DL: We left in separate vans to go back to the hotel. It’s funny because when I pulled up, there was another car in front of me and I was like, “I bet that’s Dean.” Sure enough, he gets out. I was like, “Screw this guy.” I got back to my hotel room and I think it was five minutes after I put my bags down that I got a phone call from him. I didn’t want to talk to him at all. I hung up on him several times before actually staying on the line. I gave it to him straight. I said, “You don’t know what you want. You made a complete fool of me on national television. You literally told me you loved someone else and now you’re calling me saying you want to hang out. I just don’t understand your thought process.” He told me that he was encouraged to say those things. I just think it was his way of saving face at the end of Paradise. He came over to my hotel room and we talked some more. As soon as we got back to L.A., we hung out with each other and started this off camera relationship that I thought was going in the right direction. 
Us: Was he still talking to Kristina, too?
DL: It was my understanding that he wasn’t talking to her anymore. I told him my main thing when we were dating was that I didn’t want Paradise to continue after the show. If you’re still talking to Kristina, then you need to talk with Kristina. But if you want to focus on our relationship and see where it goes then you need to cut that communication off. I don’t believe he was hooking up with anyone else. But I think he was very good at making sure that we weren’t saying we were boyfriend and girlfriend or in an exclusive relationship.
Us: What’s your relationship like with Kristina today?
DL: I’ve seen Kristina. I organized Raven’s birthday party in L.A. and we hung out and spent time together. I don’t hold anything against her. In terms of a friendship, I think it’s where we were post-Bachelor and before Bachelor in Paradise. We hang out with a lot of the same people but would her and I ever hang out one on one? No. It’s not to say I don’t like her. Some people you get a lot with more than others.
Us: And what about Dean?
DL: I’m definitely frustrated with him. I think he’s been very dismissive of our relationship and continues to allude that he only pursued me because of my looks. I’ve never been in a position or a relationship where I’ve felt so disrespected by someone. It’s frustrating because he told me he would have my back and stand up for me but at the end of the day, he just saves himself instead of being honest about things. It’s a lesson learned moving forward. I don’t hate him but I am disappointed.

Not so smooth moves! Dancing With the Stars kicks off season 25 on Monday, September 18, but pro Sharna Burgess reveals exclusively to Us Weekly that she and partner Derek Fisher have already stumbled. 
“We’ve both tumbled to the floor one time, but he’s actually amazing at making sure I get to the ground safely and then he collapses,” Burgess, 32, told Us of 43-year-old Fisher, who is former pro NBA player.
“As long as she’s safe, we’ll be fine,” Fisher added.
“I’m nervous but, like, anxious slash excited,” Fisher admitted to Us, adding that he wasn’t sure how much his athletic background would help him in the ballroom. “[I’m] used to the quick movements but I think sometimes in sports, you can get away with certain things and still get through the drill but in dance, you can’t do that. Every detail matters so you just have to be really sharp and on point. It’s tough, but it’s fun though to try and figure it out.”
Pretty much sums up our salsa 😁we dance 11th tonight so make sure you tune in and get ya phones ready to vote for this stud!!! SO.MUCH.SWAGG in this salsa 💃🏻🕺🏻👊🏻 #TeamHoopsAndHeels
A post shared by Sharna Burgess (@sharnaburgess) on Sep 18, 2017 at 8:36am PDT
The pair will be dancing the salsa for week one, and revealed they’re trying a brand new move called the “jungle gym.”
“It’s where I just throw myself at him and he has to catch me and throw me around,” shared Burgess, who has yet to win a Mirrorball trophy. “This is how we find new lifts because all the old ones have been done and we have to find new things. That’s how we figure them out.”
Fisher, who most recently was the head coach of the New York Knicks, admitted he’s in it to win it. “I’m competitive waking up in the morning,” he told Us. “I think in order to be at your highest, you have to enjoy the process and dance forces you to enjoy the process. If you don’t, you’re not going to get the results that you want. That has been enjoyable so far.”
Watch Dancing With the Stars on ABC Mondays at 8 p.m. ET. Dancing With the Stars pro Cheryl Burke is blogging exclusively with Us Weekly about her quest to take home the season 25 mirrorball trophy with partner Terrell Owens. Check back each week for her latest update on the competition.

Get ready for another round with Gilead! Us Weekly caught up with the stars of The Handmaid’s Tale at the 69th annual Emmy Awards on Sunday, September 17, and they gave Us a few hints about what’s to come for season 2.
While Madeline Brewer couldn’t reveal much about the fate of her character, Janine, who had her eye removed in season 1 as punishment, the actress did promise that viewers will see her return. “I can tell you she’s back and I still have one eye,” Brewer explained. "They haven’t taken the other eye out yet.”
O-T Fagbenle’s Luke Bankole will continue his quest to be with Elisabeth Moss’ June (who is also known as Offred). “I gotta get my wife and kid back,” he tells Us. “We’ll see how that goes!”
Amanda Brugel admits that her character Rita’s story will unfold, but the actress still wants to keep parts of the role under wraps. “I hope she still contains her mystery,” Brugel says. "I hope there’s still always an edge to her  and the audience isn’t really sure how to take her because that’s just the most fun to play. Selfishly, I hope she’s always a little on the outside."
Brugel hints that new characters will appear in the second season and that viewers will learn much more about the recurring roles from season one. “I think we now have room and permission to delve into characters,” she says. "We really had to abide by the book a lot, but now we have a little more freedom, a little more breathing room to expand into the other characters and to also see other parts beyond Gilead.”
She added: "I think its going to be quite exciting!"
Aside from hinting at what’s to come in the new season, the cast opened up to Us about spending time with each other on set. Brugel told Us: “We all just want to get back to work!”
Nina Kiri, who plays Alma, shares her costar’s sentiments, explaining how much fun the cast has while filming. “I’m just stoked to be around everyone, no matter what happens with the story, I’m just stoked to be collaborating and having a good time,” she told Us. "The last season was so fun to shoot and now that we all know each other a little bit more, it’s even more exciting!”
The actors have so much fun, Kiri says, that they often don’t realize the weight of what they’re filming when the camera is rolling. “When I watched it for the first time I was actually taken aback at how dark it was,” Kiri told Us. "When you’re on set, it’s not that it’s not dark, but because you’re all just trying to get something done and you’re talking in between you’re having a good time it doesn’t end up being as dark as it looks in t he end. We do like to chit-chat, hang out and have life talks with Ann Dowd. That just gives us all life and takes away any sort of anxiety that we might have."

She's up for the challenge! Val Chmerkovskiy's season 25 Dancing With the Stars partner, Victoria Arlen, developed two rare medical conditions as a child and eventually had to re-learn basic skills, including speaking and walking. Now, she's ready to defy the odds and tackle the ballroom.
"I never really sought out to be an inspiration," the former Paralympian swimmer, 22, exclusively told Us Weekly at Planet Hollywood in New York City on September 6. "To go from not walking to dancing in a matter of two years, it's pretty crazy. I think walking is a little easier than ballroom dancing … but I'm really grateful and blessed to be working with Val."
However, Chmerkovskiy, 31, is already showing his partner some tough love. "There [are] no pity parties," he told Us. "It's hard work and you gotta earn your celebration and earn your rest and your sleep. I just know she's that type of person and wants it anyway, so I'm going to squeeze every ounce of her potential out of her. Then I can live with the results."
Though the season hasn't even begun yet, rehearsals have already proven to be somewhat difficult. "It's been challenging," Arlen admitted. "I think anyone that goes in and says it's easy hasn't really dove into it. It's really challenging, but I like a good challenge and I have a really good teacher."
By competing on the ABC reality series, the ESPN personality hopes to inspire viewers battling their own personal struggles. "I think there are a lot of people out there that need a little hope and if I can be just a small vessel of that then I've done my job," she told Us.
The Ukranian pro dancer added, "Everyone falls down, but you have to stand up and keep going."
Dancing With the Stars season 25 premieres on ABC on Monday, September 18, at 8 p.m. ET.

Game time! Us Weekly hit the red carpet at the 2017 Emmy Awards at the Microsoft Theater in Los Angeles on Sunday, September 17, and played a few rounds of Truth or Dare with some of the biggest names in television. Watch the video above!
Anthony Anderson wasn't afraid to choose dare, though he did make a slight adjustment to Us Weekly Video Correspondent Christina Garibaldi's request. "I don't want to jinx tonight, so I can't give you my facial expression [if I win], so I'm going to give you the facial expression from the last two years [when I lost]," the Black-ish star, 47, said.
Anderson then began clapping before turning his big smile into a frown. "What the f--k?" he mouthed, mimicking his reaction to his previous losses in the Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series category. Sadly, later in the night, he lost again for the third consecutive year, this time to Atlanta's Donald Glover.
Ellie Kemper also chose dare while playing with Us — and she was asked to sing the song that she listened to while getting ready for the big night. She admitted that she didn't have any music playing earlier, but she wished she had turned on Kelly Clarkson's "Stronger (What Doesn't Kill You)." The Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt star, 37, then began singing a slightly off-key rendition of the upbeat tune.
The cast of RuPaul's Drag Race was a bit more conservative with their choice. Carson Kressley, Ross Mathews, Michelle Visage and RuPaul collectively decided to choose truth and had to decide which of the four of them has the nicest butt. "I think it's probably Michelle," Kressley, 47, responded as Visage, 48, nodded in agreement. "And it's real!" she boasted.
Watch the video above to see many more stars, including Suzanne Cryer and Finn Wolfhard, play Truth or Dare with Us Weekly!

Like mother, like daughter? Reese Witherspoon’s 18-year-old daughter, Ava Phillippe, was actually mistaken for her on the red carpet following the 2017 Emmy Awards in Los Angeles on Sunday, September 17.
Onlookers tell Us Weekly that the mother-daughter duo stopped by the HBO afterparty around 10 p.m. where a photographer pointed at the young one, whose father is actor Ryan Phillippe, called her Reese and asked her to turn around for a photo.
“I’m not her,” Phillippe told the photog. The mix-up isn’t all that surprising given the teenager, who boasts nearly 500,000 Instagram followers herself, looks so much like her famous mom.
Meanwhile, Witherspoon’s HBO series Big Little Lies won big that evening, taking home eight of its 16 nominations, including Outstanding Lead Actress in a Limited Series or Movie for Nicole Kidman, Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Limited Series or Movie for Laura Dern, Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Limited Series or Movie for Alexander Skarsgard, and Outstanding Limited Series.
“It’s great to be the architect of your own destiny and create material for yourself,” the Oscar winner, 41, who served as an executive producer alongside Kidman, 50, told reporters in the press room after their big win. “Talking about creating roles for women, I’ve been very passionate about for the last five years, and talking to Nicole about that, and seeing the parts diminish for women as you get older. It feels incredible to use the years of experience to architect a movie or television show that can read so many notable roles for women, and create award winning roles.”
The cast also revealed that night that they'd love to do a second season.

Maybe you can get all that you want. Big Little Liars’ Adam Scott celebrated along with the rest of his cast at the 2017 Emmy Awards on Sunday, September 17, and revealed where he thinks his character Ed and Madeline (Reese Witherspoon) would be today.
“I think they deserve a nice vacation. That’s what those two need,” the Parks and Recreation alum, 44, exclusively told Us Weekly at the Governors Ball. “[They need] one of those vacations where you go and make up. I think that’s what they need. They need a make up vacation.”
Ed and Madeline were rocky for most of the HBO series. Madeline cheated (unbeknownst to him), but it clearly put a strain on their relationship. In the finale, it appeared that a death brought them closer together.
“If they decide to do a season two — I loved the ending, it was kind of cliffhanger-ish. So maybe there will be more. I don’t know,” Scott told Us. “It really was a treat to work with someone so profoundly talented [as Reese]. I got to go to work every day and see this incredible performance just right in front of me. It was amazing. It was like watching a magic trick.”
Big Little Lies took home wins for best directing, outstanding limited series, supporting actor for Alexander Skarsgard, supporting actress for Laura Dern and lead actress for a limited series for Nicole Kidman on Sunday night. 
“It was so exciting,” Scott said. “I’m so proud to be a part of it. Jean-Marc [Vallee], and Nathan [Ross], and Reese [Witherspoon], and Bruna [Papandrea], and Nicole, I’m just lucky to be on for the ride. It’s an incredible show. I’m a small, but proud part of it.”

Dancing With the Stars pro Cheryl Burke is blogging exclusively with Us Weekly about her quest to take home the season 25 mirrorball trophy with partner Terrell Owens! Check back each week for her latest update on the competition.
Rehearsals are going great so far. Terrell was a last minute addition to the show, so we are not where everybody else is in terms of rehearsing. They have had three weeks to train and we, unfortunately, only had seven days before the first show. In a way, it’s a good thing that we didn’t have a lot of time, because it’s training him to learn a dance in a short amount of time. We don’t have three weeks to train for each dance, so at least he knows that’s the actual pressure of the show. You really only have a few days to learn a new dance.
I have to say, in just that short amount of time, Terrell is doing amazing; he is in great shape. The fact that he’s an athlete helps as well, because he is used to being coached. It’s as if he just got off the football field, and he really takes good care of his body. Terrell is known for his touchdown dances. I’m going to incorporate some of that choreography into our dance for the first week.
Our first dance is not easy. We have the cha-cha and we are dancing to “Ain’t Too Proud to Beg” by The Temptations, so it will be very lively. It’s a great premiere song and dance to kick the show off. The downside is that I’m only 5-foot-4 and he is 6-foot-3. Our height difference isn’t working for us, that’s for sure, but you will really be able to tell that when we do more of the ballroom dances, like the fox-trot or tango. He has such a long wingspan. His arms are very long and they kind of get in the way. He is also a size 14 shoe size, so his feet don’t help either! Because he is so long, if he doesn’t finish his lines, he can look a little awkward at times, so we are working on that. I’m also working on his posture as well.
Our goal for Monday is to get 7s to start off with.  An 8 would be amazing, but I wouldn’t be mad with all 6s, especially with the little amount of rehearsal time. I’m sure the judges are going to be hard on him, because they will see potential and will probably tell him to work on his technique. I’m expecting 6s but 7s would be like a 10 for me now!
Football players tend to do well in this competition, so there is that added pressure. I just hope people still understand that this guy has never danced before, especially ballroom dancing.
Obviously, like everybody, we want to make it all the way! I keep telling him it’s one step at a time and one dance at a time. This whole show is a journey and it’s bigger than just a dance show. It’s about showcasing his real personality and it’s about changing people’s perceptive of him, and I hope people will get to see that. I’m just trying to make him look as comfortable as possible considering we had such a short time to rehearse, but I’m confident I can do that.
There are a lot of younger celebs this season, and everyone has some sort of experience, but we will see what happens. You just never know! It’s going to be a fun season.
Watch Dancing With the Stars on ABC Mondays at 8 p.m. ET.

Still a great night. Jane Krakowski may not have taken home a win at the 2017 Emmys, but she celebrated the big night in other ways.
The Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt actress, 48, who was in attendance in support of the show’s three nominations, including Outstanding Comedy Series, Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series for Ellie Kemper, and Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series for Tituss Burgess, told Us it was still “fun to be invited” despite not winning.
In fact, the 30 Rock alum really enjoyed Stephen Colbert as a host. “It was great. It was super fun,” Krakowski told Us at the Microsoft Theater in Los Angeles on Sunday, September 17. “I thought Stephen was hilarious. It was a good night. It was fun.”
But the best moment for her involved a little low-key swig with her costar. The Ally McBeal alum told Us the highlight of her evening was “sneaking a drink with Tituss after we didn’t win anything.”
Meanwhile, Burgess, 38, looked to have a blast mingling with other stars all night, which he documented for fans on Instagram.
The Broadway alum broke into song with Black-ish stars Tracee Ellis Ross and Jennifer Lewis, as well as Insecure creator Issa Rae, in between commercials breaks and at the afterparties.
@traceeellisross we are murdering our made up song!!! And I mean murdering!!! I love u !!!
A post shared by Tituss Burgess (@titusssawthis) on Sep 18, 2017 at 12:38am PDT
“He’s way better at this than me,” Ross said as they belted out. “This is my hero.” Burgess kissed her and said, “I love you, baby.”
Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt has been nominated for 16 Emmy Awards to-date. The Netflix series was recently picked up for a fourth season.

The crowd roared with boos as Sterling K. Brown’s mic cut off and music started playing during his acceptance speech for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series at the 2017 Emmy Awards in Los Angeles on Sunday, September 17.
The This Is Us star’s win marked a historic moment as he became the first black actor to win in that category since 1998. But things turned a little awkward as he was played off stage before he could finish his speech, something that didn’t sit well with his costars either.
Onlookers tell Us that Chrissy Metz booed from her seat as Brown, 41, got a standing ovation and slapped the mic with his hand, while Milo Ventimiglia told Us at the Fox afterparty, “I think it’s unfortunate. I haven’t had a chance to ask him what the remaining was, but I read his mouth pretty well. I think he was talking about his loved ones. I’m so proud and excited for him to be on that stage.”
The Gilmore Girls alum was right as Brown talked to reporters in the press room about his family. “And to my wife, I can’t believe they cut me off before I got to thank my wife, Ryan Michelle Bathe. You’re everything. You make my life worth living,” the Black Panther actor said. “You gave me two of the most beautiful things that God has ever put on this planet: my sons Andrew Jason Sterling Brown and Amaré Michael Ryan Christian Brown. Your daddy loves you with the strength of a thousand suns. I’ll see you Monday after work.”
Meanwhile, his on-screen wife, Susan Kelechi Watson, told Us Weekly, “You know what, I guess time runs out. But the thing about Sterling is that whether the time runs out or not, the brotha has something to say and he’s gonna say it. So he took his space and he took his time and I love it.”
As for how they’re going to celebrate, the actress said, “I’m gonna jump on top of him. He deserves it.”
Brown was in the middle of thanking his castmates when the band chimed in. “You can play, you can play. Nobody got that loud music. Our writers, I love you,” he continued as cameras panned out. “You are our life’s blood. Our producers and directors, I love you.”
This Is Us returns Tuesday, September 26 at 9/8c on NBC.

Jessica Biel stunned at the 2017 Emmy Awards in L.A. on Sunday, September 17, without her usual award show date, husband Justin Timberlake, by her side — and it turns out that the actress, 35, was riding solo for a very good reason.
Timberlake, 40, touched down in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, to perform at Rock in Rio’s show the same night. The singer headlined the event, which also featured performances from Alicia Keys, Walk the Moon and Frejat.  Attendees at the annual concert series — which fundraises for social, environmental and cultural causes — also saw Maroon 5, Shawn Mendes, Fergie and more perform on previous nights.
Prior to the concert, Timberlake shared a series of behind-the-scenes photos with the caption: "We out here #RockInRio!"
Meanwhile, Biel’s night at the Emmys started on a rough note. On her way to the 69th annual ceremony,  the actress revealed that the air conditioning in her car  wasn’t working.  She captioned an Instagram post, in which she appears to be struggling through the heat, “When the AC is broken en route to the Emmy's you thank God for the ice in your drank. #emmys.”
While on the red carpet for the event, the actress — who stunned in a Ralph & Russo gown, Forevermark diamonds and Stuart Weitzman shoes — gushed over her and Timberlake’s 2-year-old son Silas’ latest milestones. “Now he’s saying to me, ‘No, no, mommy. We’re not going to do this anymore,’” Biel told E! News’ Guiliana Rancic. “And ‘this is not a match,’ which means he doesn’t want to do it anymore.”

This guy! Ben Affleck adorably spoke in his Batman voice while attending HBO’s Emmys afterparty in L.A. on Sunday, September 17.
An onlooker exclusively tells Us Weekly that Affleck, 45, got into character while taking a selfie with another attendee.
“The fan said, ’It’s nice to take a picture with Batman.' And Ben said, 'nice jacket' in his Batman voice,” the eyewitness says.
Back in July, Affleck addressed rumors that he’s not returning as Bruce Wayne. “Let me be very clear,” he said at Comic-Con in San Diego. “I am the luckiest guy in the world. Batman is the coolest part in the universe. I’m so thrilled to do it. It’s f--king amazing.”
The Justice League star attended the Emmys with his girlfriend, Saturday Night Live producer Lindsay Shookus. As previously reported, Affleck cheered her on when the NBC show won for Outstanding Variety Sketch Series.
"He jumped up and cheered when SNL won," an onlooker told Us. "He's sitting with all of SNL in the center of the theater. He's clearly her plus-one."
Affleck and Shookus, 37, recently went to the U.S. Open together in NYC and traveled to Maine. He continues to have an amicable relationship with ex-wife, Jennifer Garner, whom he shares Violet, 11, Seraphina, 8, and Samuel, 5. "He's trying to live a normal life and is focused on putting his family first,” a source told Us last month.
Affleck and Garner, 45, announced the end of their 10-year marriage in June 2015. “[Jen] is OK” with Affleck and Shookus’ relationship, a source previously told Us.

Phew! Keri Russell was totally fine with not winning the Emmy award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series during the star-studded event in L.A. on Sunday, September 17.
“It’s such a cool thing to be nominated and I’m always very secretly thankful I don’t have to speak publicly,” The Americans actress, 41, exclusively told Us Weekly after the show.
“Always secretly relieved. Always,” she added. “I just go, ‘Oh my God. Thank God.’”
The win eventually went to Elisabeth Moss for her gritty role in Hulu’s The Handmaid’s Tale. The two were also up against Viola Davis (How to Get Away With Murder), Claire Foy (The Crown), Evan Rachel Wood (Westworld) and Robin Wright (House of Cards).
Russell, now happy that the categories were all announced, let her hair down for the rest of the night. She and her longtime partner, costar Matthew Rhys, hit up the Governors Ball together.
“Now you can have fun!” she told Us, holding up a beer. She was later spotted dancing with a group of friends to Journey’s “Don’t Stop Believin.’”
The couple met on set of FX’s The Americans in 2013 and are parents of son Sam, 15 months.

Big (not so little) win! Alexander Skarsgard appeared in shock when he won the 2017 Emmy Award for Best Supporting Actor in a Limited Series or Movie — and not because of his kiss with Nicole Kidman.
Skarsgard, 41, took home the trophy for his role as Perry Wright in HBO’s Big Little Lies. “It’s really, honestly extraordinary,” Skarsgard exclusively told Us Weekly on Sunday, September 17.
The handsome star celebrated by attending the HBO afterparty at the Pacific Design Center. His plus-one? His mom, My Skarsgard!
The True Blood alum comes from a famous family. His dad is Good Will Hunting star Stellan Skarsgard and his younger brother Bill Skarsgard plays Pennywise in the terrifying horror film It, based off of Stephen King’s 1990 novel.
The Big Little Lies actor made headlines when he won on Sunday night, most notably for kissing his costar and TV wife, Kidman, on the lips before taking the stage.
“Thank you to HBO, all my friends and lovers. [To] the ladies of the show, thank you for making this boy feel like one of the girls,” he said during his acceptance speech.
The Swedish actor also had fun watching host Stephen Colbert on Sunday night. “I love him!” he told Us. “I can’t wait to see him [at the party].” 
Big Little Lies also stars Reese Witherspoon, Shailene Woodley, Laura Dern and Zoe Kravitz. The actors have all teased about a possible season 2, but nothing has been confirmed yet.

Making the rounds! Ben Affleck and his girlfriend, Saturday Night Live producer Lindsay Shookus, made it a date night at the 2017 Emmy Awards in L.A. on Sunday, September 17.
As previously reported, Affleck, 45, was on hand at the Microsoft Theater as SNL won in the Outstanding Variety Sketch Series category.
"He jumped up and cheered when SNL won," an onlooker told Us Weekly. "He's sitting with all of SNL in the center of the theater. He's clearly her plus-one."
Following the win, the couple mingled with the crowd — including Jimmy Kimmel, Louis C.K. and Tina Fey — and celebrated at both the HBO party and Governors Ball.
"Ben was very animated and more in his zone,” an eyewitness tells Us of the Justice League star at the HBO bash. “He was making everyone laugh and Lindsay had her arm around his shoulder.”
“Lindsay asked a guy to take a photo of the group on her phone,” the source adds. “Lindsay smiled at Ben and put her hand over his shoulder.”
The couple sat next to Curb Your Enthusiasm’s Larry David and Jeff Garlin. At one point, two women walked over and asked Affleck to take photos with them.
Affleck and Shookus, 37, then caught up with some of the SNL cast at the Governors Ball. “He was doting on her, running [his hand on] her back and smiling,” an onlooker tells Us. He later led her into the Emmy trophy engraving area.
A source previously told Us that Shookus and Affleck — who shares Violet, 11, Seraphina, 8, and Samuel, 5, with ex-wife Jennifer Garner — began dating in April. A second insider, however, counters that they began hooking up three years ago.

Tough competition! The coaches on season 13 of The Voice are singing the praises of newcomer Jennifer Hudson and getting ready for a competitive season in a sneak peek NBC is sharing exclusively with Us Weekly.
“She’s really not a rookie at this,” says veteran coach Blake Shelton of the Dreamgirls actress, who was the first female coach to win on the British version of the reality talent show earlier this year. “Congratulations on winning The Voice UK. We’re in the United States of America now.”
Joining Hudson and Shelton is “Malibu” singer Miley Cyrus, who first appeared on the show as a coach in 2016 for season 10, and series regular Adam Levine.
“We have no chance,” says the Maroon 5 frontman of victory. “She’s the only coach on The Voice that has an Oscar, which I’m super jealous about.”
While the American Idol alum has won an Oscar, a Golden Globe award and two Grammy awards, she reminds this season’s contestants that she began her career on a similar stage in 2004: “I started out just like you on a stage like this, and then later I look up and Whitney Houston is presenting me my first Grammy.”
“I’m grateful to have people that have been my mentors and inspiration, “ reflects the Hairspray Live! star in the video. “And then, here, y’all are going to sing to me and I get to help your dream come true? That’s gold.”
There’s only one thing on Hudson’s mind: “Winning is important to me because the contestants want to win, and I want to win for them.”
Season 13 of The
Voice premieres on Monday, September 25, at 8/7c on NBC.


Yvonne Strahovski is married! The Handmaid’s Tale actress revealed that she and her boyfriend, Tim Loden, tied the knot over the summer as they attended the Emmy Awards in L.A. on Sunday, September 17.
"We ended up jumping in the lake in our suit and gown, just to cool down," Strahovski, 35, told E! News on the red carpet. "It was ridiculously hot. But we had a great time."
Loden added: “We all made it through and did some dancing. It was fantastic.”
The couple tied the knot in Northern California after more than six years of dating.
Strahovski was in attendance to support her Hulu series, which was nominated in a whopping 13 categories. The drama won eight trophies, including outstanding drama series and outstanding lead actress in a drama series for lead Elisabeth Moss.

Milo Ventimiglia and his rumored girlfriend, Kelly Egarian, made it a date night at the 69th Primetime Emmy Awards in L.A. on Sunday, September 17.
The This Is Us actor, 40, and Egarian, a marketing coordinator for luxury fashion house Stella McCartney, got cozy at the Governors Ball at the Microsoft Theater, Us Weekly can confirm.
An eyewitness tells Us that the pair ate alone before more arrived around 8:30 p.m. They talked about how good the food was and he kissed her on the cheek.
They later were joined by his costar Mandy Moore and her fiancé, Dawes frontman Taylor Goldsmith. “[Kelly] leaned over him while they chatted and later was sitting on his lap while she texted,” the onlooker says. They later briefly slow danced together at their table and he sweetly twirled her around. 
Ventimiglia previously dated former Gilmore Girls and Heroes costars Alexis Bledel and Hayden Panettiere. Bledel, 36, was also in attendance at the Emmys and her Hulu drama The Handmaid’s Tale won for Outstanding Drama.
Ventimiglia recently revealed what he learned from dating Panettiere, 28, in an interview with Mr. Porter. (The pair ended their two-year relationship in 2009. He was 29 and she was 18.)
"Never do it again. There are things that happen to you in your life that shape who you are. Everything I've been through from jobs to friendships to partnerships, everything has built me to who I am. You learn from it. You learn a better way of doing things. It wasn't until my mid to late twenties that the job wears on you, relationships wear on you,” he said. "But I wouldn't change a thing. When you get knocked over the head in life, it builds your perspective."
Bledel and her husband, fellow Mad Men alum Vincent Kartheiser, meanwhile, secretly welcomed a baby boy in fall 2015.

Stephen Colbert brought his comedic A-game to host the 69th Annual Primetime Emmy Awards and there were a ton of noteworthy moments — everything from funny and awkward to touching and downright weird. Oh, and lots of Trump jokes.
Relive highlights from the show, held at L.A.’s Microsoft Theater, in the video above, and below:
1. Spicey Cameo!
Sean Spicer made a surprise appearance on stage after Colbert dished out several Donald Trump jokes. The former White House press secretary specifically entered scene when the host called this the most-watched Emmys of all time. “This will be the largest audience to witness an Emmys, period, both in person and around the world,” Spicer said, referring to his own remarks about Trump’s controversial inauguration attendance earlier this year.
And the kicker — as he left the stage, Colbert said, “Melissa McCarthy, everyone.” (The actress of course won an Emmy for her portrayal of Spicer on Saturday Night Live.)
2. Dave Chappelle Being Dave Chappelle
The 44-year-old comic stepped out to present Best Director for a Comedy Series alongside McCarthy — and admitted they didn’t practice what they were going to say. “It is an honor to be amongst you all and I am truly amazed how many black people are here,” Chappelle quipped. “I counted 11 on the monitor. … I should also tell you this, I skipped rehearsal.”
3. Alec Baldwin Offers Trump His Emmy
The Trump jokes didn’t stop all night as winner Alec Baldwin accepted Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series for his portrayal as the president on Saturday Night Live. “At long last, Mr. President, here is your Emmy,” Baldwin said during his speech, referencing Trump’s failure to win an Emmy of his own for The Celebrity Apprentice.
The Emmy winner took another jab at the president when he mentioned that he and his wife, Hilaria Baldwin, did not have a baby this past year. “You put that orange wig on, it’s birth control, trust me,” he joked.
4. 9 to 5 Reunion
Dolly Parton, Lily Tomlin and Jane Fonda reunited on stage to present Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Limited Series or Movie. “I have been waiting for a 9 to 5 reunion since we did the movie,” Parton said. (They stared in 1980 comedy about three working women who live out their fantasies of getting revenge on their boss.) 
Fonda added, “In 1980, we refused to be controlled by a sexist, egotistical, lying, hypocritical bigot boss.” Tomlin then quipped, “And in 2017 we still refuse to be controlled by a sexist, egotistical, lying, hypocritical bigot boss.”
5. Baby News!
The typically super private Donald Glover revealed that he’s expecting baby No. 2 with his girlfriend, Michelle, while accepting his award for Outstanding Lead Actor. “I want to thank Michelle, my partner, you love me even how crazy I get. I want to thank my baby, my son, for just being the joy in my life,” the Atlanta star said. “I want to thank my unborn son.” Congrats to the couple!
6. Making History
Speaking of Glover, 33, he took home the award for Outstanding Directing for a Comedy Series for his FX comedy-drama Atlanta, making him the first-ever black director to win in that category. With his win, Glover broke a four-year streak of female directors taking home the Emmy for Outstanding Directing for a Comedy Series.
Meanwhile, Lena Waithe, also 33, claimed the prize for Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series, making her the first-ever black woman to win in that category. She was recognized for cowriting the "Thanksgiving" episode from season 2 of Master of None with series co-creator Aziz Ansari.
7. Colbert Kills
The late-night host was clearly willing to go as far as he could when it came to his hosting duties. Not only did he bring on the political jabs, but he appeared naked in a Westworld-themed sketch and showed off his musical skills during the opening routine.

Stephen Colbert's onstage appearances at the 2017 Emmy Awards on Sunday, September 17, were surprisingly few and far between, but he still managed to deliver plenty of laughs. Watch the video above to relive Colbert's best moments as the evening's host!
1. Colbert Sings and Dances
The ceremony kicked off with a satirical musical number led by none other than the 53-year-old Late Show host. After singing about several of the nominated shows with some help from Julia Louis-Dreyfus and Chance the Rapper, Colbert hit the stage with a chorus line of dancers wearing costumes inspired by The Handmaid's Tale, which later took home the trophy for Outstanding Drama Series. "At least our future is better on TV," he sang during the political number.
2. Colbert Slams Donald Trump
After ending the song, the comedian tore into President Donald Trump. "We all know the Emmys mean a lot to Donald Trump because he was nominated multiple times for Celebrity Apprentice but he never won," Colbert said. "If he had won an Emmy, I bet he wouldn't have run for president. In a way, this is all your fault." Former White House press secretary Sean Spicer then joined Colbert on stage to poke fun at himself and the real estate mogul, 71.
3. Colbert Sits Down With 'Emmy'
In one particularly funny sketch, Colbert sat down with Emmy herself, played by RuPaul. "I'm excited to be sitting down at all. I've been holding that thing for years," the 56-year-old Drag Race host said while in a gold dress and a blonde wig. Colbert then asked Emmy the question on everyone's mind: "Do you like Oscar?" RuPaul's Emmy replied, "He's cute. We actually dated for a little while. I had to break it off."
4. Colbert Starts Drinking
After Last Week Tonight With John Oliver took home the Emmy for Best Variety Talk Series for the second year in a row, Colbert and Jimmy Kimmel, both of whom were nominated in the same category, threw some shade while sipping alcoholic beverages. "I'm drinking a specialty cocktail called the Last Week Tonight," Colbert quipped. "It's so high quality, they can only make one a week."
5. Colbert Gets Naked
The late-night host stripped down for a Westworld-inspired sketch, which featured a special appearance by Tituss Burgess. Colbert joked that he has questioned the nature of his reality "every day since November 8," referring to the day that Trump was elected president. The skit ended with a cowboy hat-clad Burgess, 38, saying, "If you'll excuse me, Stefan, I gotta go rope me some cowboys."

Second time’s a charm! After being nominated once before, Nicole Kidman won her first Emmy on Sunday, September 17, for her role as abused wife Celeste Wright on HBO’s Big Little Lies.
The 50-year-old actress made sure to thank her husband, Keith Urban, and her two daughters Sunday and Faith during her acceptance speech.
“I have two little girls, Sunday and Faith, and my darling Keith, who I ask to help me pursue this artistic path and they have to sacrifice so much for it,” Kidman said after winning Outstanding Lead Actress in a Limited Series. “So this is yours. I want my little girls to have this on their shelf and to look at it and go, ‘Every time my momma didn't put me to bed, it is because of this.’ I got something.” 
“But also I want them to know that sometimes when you are acting, you get a chance to bring a bigger message and this is their contribution and your contribution,” she concluded. “We shine a light on domestic abuse. It is a complicated, insidious disease … it exists far more than we allow ourselves to know. It is filled with shame and secrecy, and by you acknowledging me with this award, it shines a light on it even more. So thank you, thank you, thank you. I bow down to you.”
Kidman did not acknowledge her two adopted children with Tom Cruise, Connor and Isabella, during her speech. After her divorce from Cruise in 2001, she married Keith Urban in 2006. The couple welcomed Sunday Rose in July 2008, and Faith Margaret was born via surrogate in December 2010.

Donald Glover revealed some major news during his speech at the 2017 Emmys — he’s becoming a father for the second time!
“I’m so happy. Wow! Thank you guys so much. This is nuts,” the Atlanta star, 33, began while accepting his award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series at the Microsoft Theater in Los Angeles on Sunday, September 17. “I really want to thank the Academy again, everybody in here, you guys. I love you. I want to thank my mom and my dad again, I want to thank the city of Atlanta. I want to thank FX.”
He gave a shoutout to his girlfriend and their children, revealing she’s pregnant with baby No. 2. “I want to thank — I want to thank Michelle, my partner, you love me even how crazy I get. I want to thank my baby, my son, for just being the joy in my life,” Glover said. “I want to thank my unborn son, we're listening to Stevie [Wonder] tonight.”
The Community alum then took a moment to call out the president. “I want to thank [Donald] Trump for making black people No. 1 on the most oppressed list. He's the reason I'm probably up here,” Glover said. “And I just want to thank all the writers and all the people in here and everybody doing great work. Because it's so necessary and I really appreciate everybody here. Thank you so much.”
The rapper known as Childish Gambino, and his love Michelle, whose last name is unknown, welcomed their first child in 2016, Us Weekly exclusive reported, but the couple never officially announced the birth themselves as they are known to be very private.
Meanwhile, that same evening, Glover, 33, took home the trophy for Outstanding Directing for a Comedy Series for his FX comedy-drama, making him the first-ever black director to win in that category.

Donald Glover and Lena Waithe won their first Emmys on Sunday, September 17, and made history by doing so.
Glover, 33, took home the award for Outstanding Directing for a Comedy Series for his FX comedy-drama Atlanta, making him the first-ever black director to win in that category. He was nearly at a loss for words while accepting the trophy at the 2017 Emmy Awards.
"Man! First I want to thank the great algorithm that put us all here," the multihyphenate began. "I want to thank my parents, who are in the audience. This is nuts! … I just love everybody out here for letting me be up here, so thank you. Thank you all."
With his win, Glover broke a four-year streak of female directors taking home the Emmy for Outstanding Directing for a Comedy Series. He also won Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series on Sunday night, and was nominated for Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series. In addition, Atlanta received a nod for Outstanding Comedy Series.
Meanwhile, Waithe, also 33, claimed the prize for Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series, making her the first-ever black woman to win in that category. She was recognized for cowriting the "Thanksgiving" episode from season 2 of Master of None with series co-creator Aziz Ansari. Alan Yang won in the same category last year for cowriting the Netflix comedy-drama's acclaimed "Parents" episode.
Standing alongside Ansari, 34, the actress thanked the LGBTQ community. "I see each and every one of you," she said. "The things that make us different, those are our superpowers. Every day when you walk out the door, put on your imaginary cape and go out there and conquer the world because the world would not be as beautiful as it is if we weren't in it."

Trying to be funny? After Jackie Hoffman lost an Emmy to Laura Dern on Sunday, September 17 at the 69th Annual Emmy Awards, she was caught on camera cursing.
Hoffman, 56, and Dern, 50, were both nominated for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Limited Series or TV Movie. But when presenters Issa Rae and Riz Adhmed revealed that the Big Little Lies star won instead of Hoffman, Hoffman was seen saying “Damn it!” multiple times.
It didn’t end there. The Feud: Bette and Joan star, who portrayed Mamacita, then took to Twitter to complain, first writing, “Laura Dern had famous parents. Forgive me for being from real people #elitism #Emmys2017.” (Dern is the daughter of actress Diane Ladd and Bruce Dern.) 
Hoffman then went on to write shocking Tweets about Dern. “I hear that Laura Dern runs a child porn ring #soreloser Emmys2017,” Hoffman tweeted. “I hear that Laura Dern looted art from Nazi victims,” she continued, before claiming she was only joking. “I hear the media actually taking my reaction seriously? Are you kidding me?” she concluded.
Dern has been nominated six times for Emmys, but this was the actress’ first win. “I've been acting since I was 11 years old and I think I've worked with maybe 12 women, so I just want to thank the Television Academy for honoring our show and working with this incredible tribe of fierce women," she said during her acceptance speech, in which she praised her costars Reese Witherspoon, Nicole Kidman and Shailene Woodley. “Thank you to Nicole and Reese's moms for not only giving us extraordinary women, but really well-read women because that's how I'm getting parts. I share this with my tribe of four ladies."
Dern won for her role as Renata Klein in the hit HBO show, which is based off the best-selling book by Liane Moriarty.

Ben Affleck didn't hide his pride at the 2017 Emmy Awards when his girlfriend, Saturday Night Live producer Lindsay Shookus, took the stage as the NBC show won Outstanding Variety Sketch Series.
"He jumped up and cheered when SNL won," an onlooker tells Us Weekly. "He's sitting with all of SNL in the center of the theater. He's clearly her plus-one."
Following the win, the onlooker tells Us that the couple were "holding hands and whispering and smiling."
As previously reported, the pair first made their romance public in July after going on several dates in NYC, London and Los Angeles. "He isn’t relieved that this information is out there," a source told Us at the time. "But he is very happy with Lindsay and doesn’t want to hide it.”
Another insider added: "He's enjoying spending time with her."
Affleck, 45, was previously married to Jennifer Garner, with whom he shares kids Violet, Seraphina and Sam. Sources have told Us that the 13 Going on 30 actress has accepted her ex moving on. “Jen knew about the new relationship and still chose to go on vacation with Ben for the 4th of July,” an Affleck source told Us of the former couple’s July Caribbean trip. “She is OK with it."

Alec Baldwin couldn’t help but mention Donald Trump while accepting the Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series award at the 2017 Emmys on Sunday, September 17, at the Microsoft Theater in Los Angeles.
The 59-year-old actor, who was recognized for his spot-on impression of the president on the sketch comedy series, poked fun at Trump’s past comments about losing at the Emmys for his work on The Celebrity Apprentice.
“I suppose I should say — at long last, Mr. President, here is your Emmy,” Baldwin said to a roar of laughter and cheers.
If you remember, Hillary Clinton called out Trump during one of the debates for claiming the annual TV accolades were rigged, to which he responded, “Should have gotten it.”
Meanwhile, the Oscar nominee continued his speech with another dig at the commander in chief, saying, “I want to thank my wife — my wife [Hilaria] and I had three children in three years and we didn't have a child last year during the SNL season. I wonder if there is a correlation there. All you men up there, you put that orange wig on, it's birth control, trust me.”
“Thank you to Lorne [Michaels], always to Lorne, thank you to Chris [Kelly] and Sarah [Schneider] and [Erik] Kenward and all the great writers at SNL,” the Mission Impossible actor said. “Congratulations to Kate [McKinnon] and, thank you to the cast, thank you to Lindsay [Shookus] and to Grace for making me feel welcome there. Thank you to Steve for giving me a lot of encouragement. I want to say, if I leave anybody out I'm sorry, but I want to get this in: I always remember someone told me when you die you don't remember a bill that Congress passed or a decision the supreme court made, or an address made by the president — you remember a song, you remember a line from a movie, you remember a play, you remember a book, a painting, a poem — what we do is important. And for all of you out there in motion pictures and television, don't stop doing what you are doing, the audience is counting on you. Thank you.”
This was Baldwin’s third win and 18th nomination.

Stephen Colbert didn't hold back while taking jabs at President Donald Trump during his 2017 Emmy Award opening. The ceremony's host, 53, kicked off the 69th annual award show at L.A.'s Microsoft Theater on Sunday, September 17, leaving nothing off limits, including the president's claims the award show is rigged, excessive tweeting and more. (Watch a clip above!)
The bit started with the Late Show host, Allison Janney and Anthony Anderson discussing the current world issues before breaking out into a satirical musical number about how despite all of the issues, everything is better on TV.
Julia Louis Dreyfus, Chance the Rapper and more appeared throughout the musical number to sing about the nominated shows while also discussing current political issues, from Russian spies to women's health.
"Look on the bright side, Handmaids, at least your health care's free," Colbert sang, referring to The Handmaid's Tale. "At least our future's better on TV."
When Colbert took the stage, he took a moment to thank first responders who assisted during recent hurricanes Irma and Harvey, encouraging viewers to continue to donate. Soon after, he began to take jabs at Trump.
After acknowledging that there were more than 450 original scripted shows created this year, Colbert said,  "There's no way anyone could watch that much TV, other than the president." As the audience cheered, he added: "Looking forward to the tweets!"
"The biggest TV star of the last year is Donald Trump," Colbert continued.  "You can't deny every show is influenced by Donald Trump in some way. All the late night shows, obviously, House of Cards, the new season of American Horror Story, and of course next year's Latin Grammys hosted by sheriff Joe Arpaio. Muy caliente!" 
The host then referenced Trump's past issues with the annual awards ceremony. "We all know the Emmys mean a lot to Donald Trump because he was nominated multiple times for Celebrity Apprentice, but he never won," Colbert said. "Why didn't you give him an Emmy? If he had won an Emmy, I bet he wouldn't have run for president."
"I thought you people loved morally compromised antiheroes," Colbert continued. "You like Walter White? He's just Walter Much Whiter. He never forgave you and he never will. The president  has complained repeatedly that the Emmys are rigged."
Colbert then pulled up a tweet from 2014 in which the president bashed Seth Meyers as host, saying he had marbles in his mouth. When Colbert asked Meyers for a response, the camera panned to the Late Night host, who shook his head as marbles fell out.
Colbert showed yet another example of Trump's disdain over losing an Emmy as he played a clip from a 2016 presidential debate against Hillary Clinton. "There was even a time when he didn't get an Emmy for his TV program three years in a row and he started tweeting that the Emmys were rigged," Clinton said. Trump interrupted her, saying he "should've gotten it."
The audience erupted in cheers as the camera panned to Sarah Hyland, who was in tears from laughter.
To end the monologue, Colbert shocked the audience when he brought out Sean Spicer to let viewers know that this would be the biggest Emmys audience ever.

It's no secret that Stephen Colbert isn't a fan of Donald Trump, so it didn't come as a huge surprise that he ripped into the president just 12 minutes into the 2017 Emmy Awards on Sunday, September 17.
During his opening monologue, the 53-year-old Late Show host, who helmed the ceremony, pointed out that The Celebrity Apprentice — which Trump, 71, hosted from 2008 to 2015 — was nominated for an Emmy in 2009, though it lost to Extreme Makeover: Home Edition. "Why didn't you give him an Emmy? If he had won an Emmy, I bet he wouldn't have run for president," Colbert quipped. "In a way, this is all your fault. I thought you people loved morally compromised antiheroes."
Colbert then poked fun at the real estate mogul winning the 2016 presidential election despite losing the popular vote to Democratic rival Hillary Clinton. "Unlike the presidency, Emmys go to the winner of the popular vote," the late-night host said as the star-studded audience cheered.
"Of course what really matters to Donald Trump is ratings," he continued. "You got to have the big numbers. And I certainly hope we achieved that tonight. Unfortunately at this point, we have no way of knowing how big our audience is. I mean is there anyone who can say how big the audience is? Sean, do you know?"
The camera then panned to former White House press secretary Sean Spicer, who was standing at a podium. "This will be the largest audience to witness an Emmys, period, both in person and around the world," he said, spoofing the press conference in which he berated the media for accurately reporting the lackluster size of the crowd at Trump's inauguration in January.
Colbert ended his monologue by thanking Melissa McCarthy, who won an Emmy this year for her portrayal of Spicer, 45, on Saturday Night Live. She watched the hilarious moment from the audience and grinned after the political aide's brief appearance.

Tipping her hat. Kate McKinnon took a moment to thank Hillary Clinton during her speech after winning Best Supporting Actress in a Comedy at the 2017 Emmy Awards on Sunday, September 17, at the Microsoft Theater in Los Angeles.
The 33-year-old actress won for her role on Saturday Night Live, where she often impersonates the former presidential candidate. She took home the award in the same category in 2016.
“Thank you so much. Being part of this season of Saturday Night Live was the most meaningful thing that I will ever do,” the New York native began. “So I should just probably stop now. Thank you so much to [creator] Lorne Michaels for letting me be a part of this and for everything else in my life. Congratulations to our incredible cast, especially Vanessa [Bayer], Leslie [Jones] and Alec [Baldwin], love you all so much.”
She continued, “Thank you to our crew and thank you to our amazing writers. It's all about the writing, you guys. … On a personal note I want to say thank you to Hillary Clinton for your grace and grit.”
The Rough Night actress actually had dinner with the What Happened author in February in New York City. And if you remember, Clinton famously made an appearance on the sketchy comedy show in October 2015 alongside McKinnon, who was playing her in a skit at the time.

Anna Faris made her first public appearance at the 69th Primetime Emmy Awards on Sunday, September 17, since her split from Chris Pratt.
The Mom actress, 40, stunned in a purple halter dress and matching heels and kept her blonde tresses down. She appeared to not walk the red carpet outside L.A.’s Microsoft Theater.
As previously reported, Faris and Pratt, 38, announced last month that they are separating after eight years of marriage.
And she's off! @annafaris in @marcjacobs for #emmys2017
A post shared by Wendi and Nicole (@wendiandnicole) on Sep 17, 2017 at 3:05pm PDT
“We are sad to announce we are legally separating,” the former couple wrote in a joint statement at the time. “We tried really hard for a long time, and we’re really disappointed. Our son has two parents who love him very much and for his sake we want to keep the situation as private as possible moving forward. We still love each other and will always cherish our time together.”
Faris and the Guardians of the Galaxy actor met on the set of Take Me Home Tonight in 2007 and tied the knot in 2009. They are parents of son Jack, 5.
Faris opened up about their split during her Anna Faris Is Unqualified podcast on August 15. "I just want to thank you all so much for all the love I’ve been receiving, and I truly love you,” she told her listeners at the time.
Faris’ Mom costar Allison Janney would later discuss the exes during an interview with Entertainment Tonight on September 11. "She's a very courageous and strong girl and very professional and love her so much, as do[es] everyone. And we love Chris too. We love them both. It's sad when, you know, people who have to go separate ways, but we support them both and love them both very much,” she said.

Newlyweds’ night out! Emmy Rossum hit the red carpet looking stunning alongside new husband Sam Esmail at the 2017 Emmy Awards on Sunday, September 17, at the Microsoft Theater in Los Angeles.
The 31-year-old actress turned heads in a sparkly Zac Posen number with her hair swept to one side. She finished off the look with some gorgeous emerald-coloring jewelry.
Meanwhile, the Mr. Robot creator looked dapper in a matching black suit as they posed together before heading inside. This was the couple’s first red carpet appearance together since tying the knot in New York City on May 28.
Rossum’s Shameless costar William H. Macy is nominated for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series.
The hit Showtime series will be back for season 8 after the Phantom of the Opera alum resolved contract negotiations with the network, putting her pay level more equal to Macy’s, which he supported.
“She works as hard as I do. She deserves everything,” the Emmy nominee told TMZ in December 2016. “They wrote the Equal Rights Amendment in 1927. It didn’t get passed by both houses of Congress until 1972. It still hasn’t been approved by all the states. It’s about f--king time, don’t you think?”
Shameless returns for its eighth season November 5 on Showtime.

Shailene Woodley hasn't owned a TV in about seven years despite starring in Big Little Lies, one of the year's most talked-about shows.
"I technically don't have a home anywhere, so there's nowhere to put a TV," the actress, 25, admitted during a red carpet interview with E! News ahead of the 2017 Emmy Awards on Sunday, September 17.
"I haven't had a TV since I moved out of my parents' house at 18," she continued. "All my friends who watch TV, I always ask them when they have time to. When do people have time?"
The biggest reason Woodley doesn't flip through the channels? "I'm a reader," she explained. "So I always read a book instead of turning on my TV."
However, that doesn't mean she isn't thrilled about the astounding 16 nominations that Big Little Lies received this year. "So exciting," Woodley gushed. "It means people are hungry for shows like this. They want to celebrate shows like this when they have the opportunities to explore the emotionality behind the characters instead of just the plot lines, the story lines. You get to experience their inner workings. That, to me, is what is so exciting about the nominations."
Big Little Lies, which is based on Liane Moriarty's bestselling novel of the same name, aired on HBO from February to April. The series also starred Reese Witherspoon, Nicole Kidman, Laura Dern and Alexander Skarsgård. Though it has yet to be picked up, fans have begged the cast and creators to return for a second season. Woodley, for her part, is down. "Of course I'd do it," she recently told Marie Claire U.K. "It would be so fun."

Who knew? Sofia Vergara revealed on the Emmys 2017 red carpet that her husband, True Blood star Joe Manganiello, is a big “nerd.”
The Modern Family star, 45, was asked Jason Kennedy on E! Live From the Red Carpet on Sunday, September 17, to reveal something people wouldn’t know about her other half, who she wed in a glamorous ceremony in Palm Beach, Florida, in 2015.
And she didn’t hold back. 
“He’s a nerd,” the Colombian star said of the Magic Mike star, 40, who is currently in New York City shooting the film Stano.
“The highlight of his life is to play Dungeons & Dragons,” she added, referring to the fantasy role-playing game beloved by nerds around the world.
“He talks together with, like, eight friends,” Vergara — who wore a stunning white Mark Zunino dress — continued. “I do, like, a spread of food downstairs. He has a ‘dungeon’ room downstairs — spectacular. I decorate it for him.”
And what does she do while he’s battling demon lords? 
“I bring food,” she added. “He sits there for six to eight hours playing Dungeons & Dragons.”
But so far — while she’s embraced his passion for the Pittsburgh Steelers — Vergara hasn’t learned how to play D&D.
“I organize the figurines and put the cheese out,” she said.
The four-time Emmy nominee has been busy during her summer hiatus — she just finished shooting a movie called Bent in Italy with Andy Garcia.
Vergara plays a spy in the movie but insisted, “I’m not hot in the movie. I did bad makeup. I didn’t put [on] eyelashes, nothing.”
“I downplay[ed] myself,” she told Kennedy. “It was very hard.”

Absolutely sinful! Jessica Biel’s air conditioning didn’t work on the way to the 69th Primetime Emmy Awards in L.A. on Sunday, September 17, and yet she still looked absolutely flawless.
The Sinner actress, 35, joked about the brief heatwave in an Instagram selfie. “When the AC is broken en route to the Emmy's you thank God for the ice in your drank. #emmys,” she captioned the pic.
Biel attended the star-studded event at Microsoft Theater without hubby Justin Timberlake, but she did gush about their 2-year-old son, Silas.

“Now he’s saying to me, ‘No, no, mommy. We’re not going to do this anymore’ and ‘this is not a match,’ which means he doesn’t want to do it anymore,” she told E! News’ Giuliana Rancic on the red carpet.
The 7th Heaven alum currently stars as Cora Tannetti in USA Network's The Sinner — and produces the thriller.
“[I like] the creative part of producing. I like working with the writers,” Biel said on Sunday night, noting that she may want to do more behind-the-scenes work in the future. “I like working with the actors.”

She’s saying it like she means it! Wendy Williams is gearing up for the ninth season of The Wendy Williams Show, which premieres Monday, September 18, and the always outspoken host opened up to Us Weekly about what viewers can expect and much more.
Of Monday’s premiere, the 53-year-old former disk jockey told Us that she’s serving “nothing but hot topics” to the delight of her loyal audience, whom she calls “Wendy watchers.” 
And in the days following the show’s highly anticipated premiere, heavy hitting talent including Eva Longoria, Karrueche Tran and Bacherlorette star Rachel Lindsay (along with fiancé Bryan Abasolo) will all stop by the star’s purple couch for great conversation and lots of laughs. 
While The New York Times bestselling author admits she’s never seen an episode of the wildly popular ABC dating competition series, she revealed that she keeps tabs on celebs by doing a little research. “I read the magazines. I read Us,” she explained. “You don’t necessarily have to watch the show to be intrigued with the person.”  
And from what she told Us, Williams and Lindsay will have a lot to talk about. “With all those smarts, if my daughter wanted to do a reality show, I would crack her skull,” she said. “We send our daughter to a good college and then off to law school only for her to be clowing around on TV? I would be very upset. Reality shows aren’t for overly educated people.” 
The Think Like a Man actress, who will light the Empire State Building purple on Monday in honor of the show’s return, pointed out that while she doesn’t have a favorite celebrity interview, she did say a comedian, who appeared on a past episode of her show, is no longer welcome back after he “motor-boated” her during an interview.
As for the TV personality’s dream guest, an open invitation awaits Shia Labeouf. Williams has the Transformer actor’s picture framed and displayed in her office, noting that she likes her stars “young and hot with a bit of danger.” 
When the star is not entertaining fans with her popular advice segment “Ask Wendy,” she’s busy weighing in on the latest celebrity feuds. When asked if she was Team Taylor Swift or Team Katy Perry the HSN designer quipped, “Taylor. Katy is not worth 25 million dollars” (a reference to the “Swish Swish” singer’s American Idol salary). ... I still like her music though, it makes me feel young.”
Williams proved she’s just like Us. Her biggest fear? “Going broke,” adding that “all money is not good money.”  She mentioned that her most embarrassing moment includes public vomiting: “Please, I still party like I’m in college,” she joked. 
The ninth season of the Wendy Williams Show premieres Monday, September 18. Checking your local listings.

Get ready, fangirls! Simon Cowell’s new boy band, PRETTYMUCH, premiered their music video for their debut single “Would You Mind.” The quintet, which includes members Austin Porter, 19, Brandon Arreaga, 17, Edwin Honoret, 18, Nick Mara, 19, and Zion Kuwonu, 18, released their video worldwide on Friday, September 15, on MTV, MTV2, MTV Live and mtvU.
“Being in the group is one of the sickest things ever,” Kuwonu says in the beginning of the music video. “It’s a good vibe to be in this band.” In the clip, the boys are hanging out on the streets of Los Angeles, dancing in the rain with a big crowd, and end it with a black screen that reads: “To be continued.”
The video was filmed in L.A. and was directed by Emil Nava, who has worked with big names in the industry such as Calvin Harris, Ed Sheeran and Selena Gomez. The group shared a short video with their followers on Instagram to promote the release on Friday, writing: "Thank you guys for being a part of this journey with us.

Here’s comes the bride. Joy-Anna Duggar sat down with then-fiance Austin Forsyth to pick out their wedding cake in a new clip from next week’s September 18 episode of TLC’s Counting On.
The reality star, 19, and her now-husband, 23, seemed to have a little trouble figuring out exactly what kind of cake they wanted for the nuptials, which took place in Rogers, Arkansas, on May 26, just two months after getting engaged.
Duggar talked with the baker and expressed her desire for a three or four-tiered cake that was off-white and “really simple.”
“I’m open to a lot of ideas. I don’t know if I’m going to go more simple or more fancy. I’m going to just wait and see,” she told the cameras.
Meanwhile, Forsyth was surprised to find out how many little details go into every decision for the big day. “Being engaged and planning our wedding, there are a lot of decisions that have to be made that I never thought of,” he said, later adding, “It was a little more than I have ever thought about.”
The couple’s ceremony actually came several months before their previously scheduled wedding date of October 28. Following the big day, the duo enjoyed a romantic honeymoon in Switzerland.
"Saying our vows and saying 'I do' and committing our lives to each other is so incredible," the bride gushed at the time. "I am so blessed to be married to him."
Forsyth added, ”I’m just looking forward to getting to share my life, its good time and its challenges, with my best friend.”
The pair are currently expecting their first child together. "We’re so happy and thankful to announce that we’re expecting a baby!" Duggar told Us in a statement on August 30. "Every child is such a precious gift from God. I’m most looking forward to watching Austin as a dad and raising children together with him. “
Counting On airs Mondays at 9/8c on TLC.

Don’t mess with J. Law! Jennifer Lawrence appeared on Late Night With Seth Meyers on Thursday, September 14, and gave a play by play of her bar fight with a guy in Budapest. The actress, 27, was promoting her film Mother!, but things took a hilarious turn when she told the story of what exactly went down during the altercation in Hungary, where she was filming the movie Red Sparrow.
“I have another drinking story about Budapest,” she told the TV host. “I got in a bar fight! I got in a real bar fight!”
“That seems like a dangerous place to get into a bar fight,” Meyers, 43, said.
 Lawrence replied with a smile: “I mean, for him!”
"We were at a bar, it was beer night. We had a ton of beers, we were all drinking. I was drunk, which is rare," the Oscar-winner recalled. "I was drunk and this guy asked me for a selfie and I was like, ‘No. Thank you, no.' And then he was like, ‘Please, my girlfriend will never believe you! My friend was like, ‘If your girlfriend won’t believe you then she’s not the one.’ And so we were like, ‘Just go away.’ And then he goes, ‘Well, f--k you!”
The insult didn’t sit well with Lawrence and she said she felt something snap in her at that moment: “It couldn’t have been the alcohol.” She then confronted the guy and yelled repeatedly, “Did you just say ‘f--ck you’ to me? Did you just say ‘f--ck you’ to me?”
“I grabbed him and took beers, and I started dousing them all over him,” the actress added, revealing that she then proceeded to throw more beer on his suitcase. According to the Hunger Games actress, her friend Chris grabbed her from behind and started telling her to not waste any more beer and she instantly relaxed: “Of course! What was I thinking?”
As for the guy, he seems to have regretted crossing Lawrence. One of the star’s friends came out of the bathroom after the incident, and according to Lawrence, saw the guy "all wet and crying.”
Watch Jennifer Lawrence tell the hilarious story in the clip above. Mother! hits theaters on Friday, September 15, and Red Sparrow is slated for a March 2, 2018, release. Tune into Late Night with Seth Meyers on weeknights at 12:35 a.m. ET on NBC.

What’s cookin’, good lookin’? Lo Bosworth show Us Weekly how to make a caramelized banana nut smoothie bowl that’s worthy of your Instagram feed. Watch the video above and cook along with her as she whips up the beautiful breakfast in her cozy New York City apartment.
“They’re perfect for breakfast, and they’re also perfect for your Instagram if you want to post a very glamorous picture of what you’re eating for breakfast,” the blogger and Hills alum says about the recipe.
Smoothie bowls recently became popular on social media because they’re not only easy and delicious, but also picture-worthy. Even better, you can customize your bowl to your preferences. If you want a pink smoothie bowl, add strawberries and raspberries. For a green smoothie bowl, add spinach.
And don’t forget the most important part — the toppings! Bosworth, 30, tops hers off with toasted coconut, spiced nuts and caramelized bananas, which she says are the “superstar of the smoothie bowl.”
The impressive breakfast dish is simple, beautiful and delicious, and reflects Bosworth’s cooking style: “I’m a laid-back chef. I kind of like to think that Julia Child was a laid-back chef and she’s my all-time cooking inspiration.”
Check out the full recipe below and be sure to keep up
with Bosworth on her lifestyle blog, TheLoDown.com.

What gives? Big Brother's Alex Ow is finally explaining why she disliked fellow houseguest Kevin Schlehuber so much.
"Kevin was always doing things to me as a 'control' factor. He would purposely ask us the same questions, he would make big deals about nothing just to get under my skin," Ow, 28, exclusively tells Us Weekly. "He never once cooked a meal on his own, he would say snide comments, and mock me. He was very passive aggressive and irritating. He would tell all these gangster stories and tell these 'bad ass' stories. I just saw him as a fake and phony and would call him out on that – and he didn’t like it."
Ow was evicted from the CBS game on Wednesday, September 13, with Schlehuber, 56, following her to the jury house the next day.
Ow was clear about those she despised, but did she have a secret crush? "That's actually an interesting question — but no!" she says. "Paul [Abrahamian] is way too young. Cody [Nickson] is maybe too old? I had no crushes in the house. Outside of the house, I’m into super tall guys. Jason [Dent] is tall but he's married and I’m not going anywhere near that! I am not a homewrecker!"
For more, read the rest of her Q&A below:
US: Who did you trust more in the game — Paul or Jason?
AO: Absolutely 1000% Jason. I handpicked him as my ride or die for every step of the way. He sent Elena [Davies] out for me after the Outback veto competition. He was loyal, dedicated and I can’t thank him enough for the love and support he gave me the entire game. Jason all the way!
US: Why will you still tell Jason to vote for Paul if Jason was blindsided during his eviction?
AO: The one thing people forget to separate in Big Brother, is that it is a game. As much as I didn’t like that Paul blindsided and cheated us, Paul played the best game. I’m going to try my best to tell Jason because he deserves it most out of the people that are left. Paul has played a great mental, physical and social game and I want to reward that. Whoever did the best deserves to win.
US: Why did you put up Kevin and Raven Walton during the double eviction and not a bigger target like Paul or Christmas Abbott? AO: So, I didn’t put up Paul because he’s a part of our trio alliance. The reason I put up Kevin and Raven was because they were our original targets and I didn’t have a good relationship with either of them in the house. I thought Christmas and Josh [Martinez] would come through at the end but they took me out.
Big Brother airs on CBS on Sundays and Wednesdays at 8 p.m. ET and Thursdays at 9 p.m. ET.

She approves! Andi Dorfman was in attendance at Us Weekly’s 2017 Most Stylish New Yorkers bash in The Jane Ballroom at The Jane Hotel on Tuesday, September 12, which was sponsored by Stella Artois, Bioré and Spike’s Ink Master: Angels — and she told Us exactly how she feels about the upcoming season of The Bachelor.
Fans of the ABC show were surprised when Arie Luyendyk Jr. was revealed as season 22’s Bachelor during Good Morning America on September 7, and the Bachelorette alum was no different.
“I think they took us for a crazy twist and turn. I don’t think anyone saw that coming,” she told Us on the red carpet. “But I think it’s cool, it’s kind of interesting. It’s going back a little old school.”
The reality star added: “I think it’s going to be interesting to see what girls come out of the past. I’m excited for that. I cannot wait to see what girls from Arie’s past come on the show.”
Dorfman also talked to Us about attending fellow Bachelor alum Sharleen Joynt's wedding to Andy Levine on Friday, September 8, in a small ceremony in NYC’s Battery Park City neighborhood. “It was great. We had a great time. It was Sharleen’s wedding and she was stunning, of course, as always,” she told Us. “It was also like a little Bachelor reunion, which was really fun.”
Her ex Nick Viall was also in attendance at the wedding, but even though they made amends earlier this year, they did not discuss his recent split from Vanessa Grimaldi. “No, we kind of all are friendly but it’s awkward to talk to your exes about their now current exes,” she told Us. “So we just don’t talk about it. We all sat together and had a great time.”
Congratulations to these two beautiful people. I've never met such a perfect couple, both equally lucky to have one another. I'm lucky to be able to call you both friends. Love you both #wedding #nyc
A post shared by Nick Viall (@nickviall) on Sep 9, 2017 at 7:33am PDT
In February of this year, Viall, 36, finally made peace with Dorfman, 30, during an episode of The Bachelor after she broke his heart when she gave her final rose to Josh Murray on The Bachelorette season 10 finale that aired in 2014.
The Bachelor returns to ABC in January 2018.

Can't score tickets to Hamilton? Just tune in to Dancing With the Stars! Jordan Fisher and his pro dance partner, Lindsay Arnold, are already brainstorming ideas for a dance routine inspired by the hit musical.
"We can say that it has been thought of! You'll just have to wait and keep voting us in so we can do it," Arnold, 23, exclusively told Us Weekly at Planet Hollywood in New York City on September 6. Fisher, also 23, chimed in, "Thrown out there!"
In the meantime, the actor-singer, who played John Laurens and Philip Hamilton in the Broadway production, has the full support of his castmates. "I'm the first Hamilton alum [on DWTS] so I'm excited to have support. We go deep," he told Us. "It's really nice to have that support and that love."
Despite his experience on stage, Fisher is going to need some practice as he hasn't had any prior ballroom training. "He thought the jive was referred to as swing. I was like, 'OK, no,'" Arnold quipped to Us. "It was actually really funny to watch because he's seen the show so he's heard the names. He called the Viennese waltz the Vietnamese waltz — wrong country! It's been funny to teach him those things because he's been a fan of the show and knows kind of the gist of it, but it's been fun to solidify those details."
And the Grease: Live star is already adjusting to his new role. "Seeing the translation from watching numbers to her teaching me a move and being like, 'Whoa, I've seen that move before. That's so cool!'" he told Us.
Dancing With the Stars season 22 premieres on ABC on Monday, September 18, at 8 p.m. ET.

Heartbreak is a prominent theme on Fergie's upcoming second album, Double Dutchess. Amid the shocking news of the singer's split from husband Josh Duhamel, Us Weekly examines the most gut-wrenching lyrics from her latest solo effort.
Last November, Fergie, 42, released "Life Goes On" as the third single off the highly anticipated album. Many music critics noted at the time that the song dropped the same week that Donald Trump was elected president, but the lyrics appear to address a crumbling relationship rather than political unrest.
"Life goes on, with or without you / It's up to you what you're gonna do," she sings during the chorus. "You could go or you could stay / But who cares anyway?"
The former Black Eyed Peas singer also bares her soul on "A Little Work." In the first verse, she croons, "Got bruises on my heart, plenty of scars on my mind / Got blisters under the Band-Aid over my life / Gonna rip it open and show the world what's there." And later, she sings, "When everything around me starts to fall / I rise up again to the call / We're all just a little bit broken / We're all just a little bit hurt."
The album closes with the aptly titled "Love Is Pain," one of the rawest and most passionate ballads on the tracklist. "You don't know how it feels to be me / Wish you could feel it," Fergie begins. "You could never survive this burning / Fever growing inside a shell that you call a body / What have you done to us?"

The "Fergalicious" singer and the Transformers actor, 44, announced on Thursday, September 14, that they had called it quits after eight years of marriage. "With absolute love and respect, we decided to separate as a couple earlier this year," the parents of 4-year-old son Axl said in a joint statement to Us. "To give our family the best opportunity to adjust, we wanted to keep this a private matter before sharing it with the public. We are and will always be united in our support of each other and our family."
Double Dutchess is out Friday, September 22.

A member for the Beygency has spoken! Dancer and Taylor Swift BFF Todrick Hall is speaking out to Us Weekly about comparisons that were made between Swift and Beyoncé over her “Look What You Made Me Do” video. Watch the video above!
The Beyhive were quick to see similarities between “LWYMMD” and Beyonce’s 2016 “Formation” video, but Hall, 32, who previously worked on Beyoncé’s Lemonade and was one of Swift’s backup dancers in the video, was quick to shut it down.
“I was surprised because in the room and in the setting I didn't feel like this was a really Beyoncé-esque thing to do, but I can see because she has done that pose a lot,” Hall told Us Weekly. “Looking at the set I was just like this is not something that would be Beyoncé aesthetic. It was just a completely different aesthetic and I, as a board member of the Beygency, felt like if we were snatching something from Beyoncé I would have been like ‘OK, Taylor, one second.’”
However, the YouTube star and former American Idol contestant, does feel like Swift, 27, and Beyoncé, 36, do have a similar work ethic, saying that the “Ready For It” songstress showed up on set and took the choreography “very seriously.”
“I was so proud of her,” Hall said. “I could tell that she was a little bit nervous on set so I'm so glad that I was there to hold her hand through it and let her know that she looked great.”
In between dancing with Swift and creating his next viral YouTube video, Hall is now a mentor on the reboot of the Mickey Mouse Club. Disney debuted the new Club Mickey Mouse, which features a brand new crop of rising stars, on September 8 on Facebook.
“They are great dancers, singers, actors and musicians and a lot of them are really big on social media and have been known for being in music videos and working in the industry already,” Hall tells Us Weekly. “But to watch them working in this capacity and on this platform is really really awesome because they are all so talented in such different ways.”
To find out who Hall thinks “Look What You Made Me Do” is really about, watch the video above!

Did they or didn’t they? That’s what fans were asking about Justin Bieber and Miranda Kerr. The Canadian pop star and the former Victoria's Secret model reportedly exchanged flirty text messages and kisses on the cheek after the 2012 Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show.
It wasn’t just fans who wanted to know. The brunette bombshell was still married to Orlando Bloom at the time. Kerr denied the allegations, but split from Bloom, with whom she shares son Flynn, in 2013 after three years of marriage. The rumor mill re-ignited in 2014 when Pirates of the Caribbean actor was spotted in a scuffle with the "Sorry" singer in Ibiza.
Us Weekly’s Famous Feuds on Friday will tackle Bloom vs. Bieber, and take a deep dive into what really happened between the sexy supermodel and the bad boy of pop music. The episode will also take a closer look at Kayne West and Taylor Swift’s epic clash.
Watch an exclusive sneak peek of Friday’s episode above.
Us Weekly's Famous Feuds airs on REELZ Fridays at 9 p.m. ET.

They’ve still got it! Whoopi Goldberg, Kathy Najimy and Wendy Makkena reunited for an epic Sister Act reunion!
The leading ladies of the 1992 classic got together on The View on Thursday, September 14, to reflect on their favorite memories from filming. Najimy (Sister Mary Patrick) and Makkena (Sister Mary Robert) recalled the songs they sang for their auditions. Meanwhile, Goldberg (Deloris Van Cartier), who confirmed that she was really singing in the comedy, revealed that Bette Midler was initially going to portray her award-winning role!
“It was [her] movie and she couldn’t do it. She turned it down. They went through 100 million people and then got to me,” The View host, 61, joked.
Later in the episode, Maggie Smith (Mother Superior) surprised her former costars with a heartfelt message. “Hello, Whoopi. I can’t believe this is happening and it was 25 years ago. I would like to say hello to all of the nuns. I feel I must be the oldest nun left. Every single nun was wonderful,” the Harry Potter alum, 82, said via a pre-recorded video message. “And how are you? Because I remember the last time I saw you was rather sad. It was at the London Palladium and your mother was not well and I am sorry about that, but it was terrific to see you. But I have such fond memories of when we did those crazy, crazy films. And we laughed and laughed. I can’t believe it’s been 25 years. I send you lots of love and I wish I were with you.
When asked what it was like working with Smith, Goldberg explained, “I couldn’t believe she wanted to do the movie. I said, ‘You’re Maggie Smith. What are you doing here?’ She said, ‘Darling, I have to eat.’ She also said, ‘I have to act, it’s what I do. I want to be here. It seems like fun.’ When she came to see it, it was kind of extraordinary.”
The actresses also remembered a time when they had to stay in a not-so-nice hotel while shooting in Reno. “Kathy and I would get a little bored. We would be playing blackjack all day in our habits and nobody knew who we were,” Makkena reminisced. “That was fun.”
Najimy added: “The habit was great. You could get in anywhere. You could eat anything. In one of these hotel rooms, we ordered wine and fries as one does in a nun’s outfit.”
Watch the clip above to see your favorite nuns reunite in song!

He’ll float too! James Corden dressed as the demonic, shape-shifting clown, Pennywise, from the horror remake It.
In a hilarious spoof on The Late Late Show with James Corden on Wednesday, September 13, an office worker, Tim, with a faulty computer requests help from the I.T. department. Apparently a miscommunication unfolded, because Tim is greeted by none other that Pennywise himself!
“I see the problem. You called the I.T. department and I’m It. So there’s been a mixup,” the British late-night host, 39, in character, tells Tim. “It’s not your fault, it happens all the time.”
Corden then proceeds to help Tim try to fix his computer. In a nod to the cult classic where Pennywise can be seen lurking through the sewers, Tim catches a glimpse of just Corden’s head in between his office files!
“I’m helping you look for your password,” Corden explains to a terrified Tim.
Moments later, the film’s iconic red balloon rises from behind the computer. “I’m not trying to scare you! It was under the desk, it was easier to come up from this side,” he clarified, adding that the balloon was “blocking the wifi signal.”
Tim, clearly frustrated, grabs a pen to pop the balloon. “I wouldn’t,” Corden warns. “I wouldn’t, if I was you.” Tim does so anyway, only to be splattered by red paint — in the movie, Beverly Marsh encountered a similar red balloon full of blood.
When Tim complains that he has a meeting in 20 minutes and his clothes are now messed up, Corden gets real. “Oh, come on. Everyone knows you don’t pop a murderous clown’s balloon,” he said. “That’s on you.”
Shortly after, one of Tim’s colleagues enters the room. “Hey, Penny,” she greets Corden before reprimanding Tim. “Everyone knows you don’t pop the scary clown ballon. What is this, amateur hour?”
Watch the clip above to see if any more villains come to scare Tim!

Nobody puts Baby in the corner! Jessica Biel made quite an entrance for her appearance on The Ellen DeGeneres Show on Thursday, September 14, by nailing the iconic lift from the movie Dirty Dancing. After successfully recreating the dance move, she even credited her husband Justin Timberlake for helping her practice it at home.
Biel wore a form-fitting, black and red dress and paired it with red and blue heels as she came out through the stairs behind the audience. Stephen "tWitch" Boss waited for her in the crowd and they walked onto the stage holding hands as Bill Medley and Jennifer Warnes’s song “The Time Of My Life” started playing. The pair broke into a choreographed dance, and that's when the show’s DJ took his hat off as the actress jumped into his arms and he lifted her in the air.
The TV host seemed shocked by the move telling the 7th Heaven star: "That was so brave of you!" and Biel, 35, replied, "I trust him!" pointing at Boss. “That was fantastic,” DeGeneres said. “Somebody now has to top that entrance. That is the best entrance we’ve ever had.”
"Well, see that’s what happens when I was speaking to producers and they said, ‘You still hold the record for the longest dancing,' which was so humiliating when I went back and looked at it because I'm not a good dancer really," Biel said, referring to her past entrance on the show. "So I was thinking 'What am I going to do?' This is season 15, and you're doing new stuff!"
Biel confessed that although landing the move looked effortless, it did require some practicing at home. "Justin is a really good dancer, have y’all tried that?" DeGeneres asked her. “I make him do stuff like that all the time, his back goes out. It’s a disaster," the actress said. "Certainly, all the time. In the pool, outside of the pool. It's a little easier [in the pool], yeah."
Dancing is not the only area in which the "Can't Stop the Feeling" singer steps in to help his wife: "I’m not a great cook but I do like to attempt and I do have some help sometimes," she confessed about her skills in the kitchen. "He’s more of a breakfast — he likes to cook breakfast."
The star was on the show to promote her new show The Sinner and said that sometimes it gets awkward to do kissing scenes as an actor if you have a spouse. "Well, it's one of those weird things where when you're married to an actor, you kind of have to be OK with," she said. "It's never like, 'Yeah, alright! Fist bump, yeah!' It's never that, but, you know, you understand, and he has to do it so you just get used to it I guess… a little bit. This one was a lot, I do have to say that.”
In the USA series, Biel's character is a young mother who is trying to find out what is causing her to have fits of rage after she doesn't know why she committed a violent crime.
New episodes of The Sinner air Wednesdays at 10 p.m. ET on USA.

They’re back! After 10 years off the air, Trading Spaces is heading back to TV and bringing some of its beloved stars along for the ride. TLC announced on Wednesday, September 13, that designers Ty Pennington, Hildi Santo-Thomas, Genevieve Gorder, Carter Oosterhouse, Doug Wilson and Vern Yip are joining the show's 2018 reboot.
The group announced their return via a short video on the network's website. "We're getting the band back together!" Pennington declared. "I'm so excited to see some of their faces. I mean, I haven't seen some of these people literally in decades!"
TLC also revealed the seasoned vets will be joined by some new designers: “Joining these familiar faces are new design experts and carpenters Brett Tutor, Joanie Sprague, John Gidding, Kahi Lee and Sabrina Soto. With a combined over 30 years of experience between them, this lineup is well-equipped to help homeowners tackle their ambitious redesign projects.”
The network previously announced on July 19 that Paige Davis is returning to host after leaving in 2005. "I will be hosting Trading Spaces again. I'm back at TLC, back home and back where I belong," the TV personality, 47, also said in a video.
The home renovation reality show ran from 2000 to 2008, and was hosted by Alex McLeod in the first season before Davis took over for season 2. Davis served as the host of the reality series from 2001 to 2004 until she was taken off the show in January 2005 as the network tested a host-free format. She briefly returned in 2008 before the series came to an end after season 8.
The home-redesign show features two sets of neighbors who are put to the test as they redecorate a room in each others' homes. The teams have two days and a $1,000 budget to complete the redesign with the help of a professional designer and carpenter. Teams have no control over the redecoration in their own home and aren’t allowed to re-enter their own home until the reveal.
The new season of Trading Spaces is slated for a 2018 return on TLC.

Red carpet ready … almost! Us Weekly is gearing up to attend the 2017 Emmy Awards in Los Angeles, but there is one thing that is needed for the big event: a dress. Us Weekly Correspondent, Christina Garibaldi, headed to the Bloomingdale’s flagship in NYC, where fashion director Erica Russo took her on a tour of the best red carpet looks. However, she’s having a hard time making a decision, so we need your help. Watch the video above and vote on your favorite dress!
First up was an Avery G burgundy velvet off-the-shoulder gown, which Russo admits is “one of the biggest trends all over the runway.” However, Garibaldi couldn’t resist the allure of a statement red dress, which would perfectly complement the carpet.
“Red was probably one of the biggest trends to go throughout all four cities of fall fashion week," Russo tells Us Weekly. “Fendi walked head-to-toe looks of red down the runway, and Givenchy, every single look in his line was head-to-toe red.”
Yet, nothing says fall like floral, which, according to Russo, is “having such a moment.” The Avery G navy oversized floral look mixed elegance and sexiness with a vintage feel, creating a statement look for the carpet.
However, it appears that fall 2017 is all about the ‘90s! Garibaldi slipped into a Jarlo slip dress, which was not only comfortable (key to a red carpet), but also sleek and sophisticated as well.
“What I love about this one is it’s very modern,” Russo explained. “Then of course this great little keyhole moment that’s happening is really important and really on trend.”
So which dress should our correspondent wear on the carpet? Watch the video and vote for your favorite!


No more drama! Danielle Staub was among the celebrities who attended Us Weekly’s 2017 Most Stylish New Yorkers bash, which was sponsored by Stella Artois, Bioré and Spike’s Ink Master: Angels, at The Jane Ballroom at The Jane Hotel on Tuesday, September 12, and she told Us all about her upcoming return to The Real Housewives of New Jersey.
“I am so ready," Staub told Us. "Everything aligned perfectly." News broke earlier this year that the star will rejoin the Bravo show for the upcoming eighth season, marking her return since leaving after season 2. During her run on the show, there were a lot of fights between Staub and Teresa Giudice, but the two have since put their past feuds behind them, even calling things between them “perfect.”
“We’re really good. I just don’t think there’s going to be any problems between she and I,” Staub told Us on the red carpet. “I don’t think that anyone would want to do that to us again.” She continued, “We had a hard time. We had a long road back to each other, so it’s really amazing to have this side of her again in my life and the rest of the cast, too.”
The two reality stars took a yoga class together in October 2016 and posted pictures of the moment on social media. "We reconnected and it has been so natural and great,” Staub told Us at the time. “Today was the first time I have seen her in all these years. She reached out to me a few weeks ago to talk and catch up on our families.”
Just because the pair have made amends doesn’t mean the new season will be without some turmoil. “So much that you guys are going to be sitting at the edges of your seats,” she said about the show. “Get the popcorn ready, I’m telling you right now!”
The Real Housewives of New Jersey returns for season 8 on Wednesday, October 4, at 9 p.m. ET on Bravo.

Frankie Muniz is in high demand. In an exclusive interview with Us Weekly, the Malcolm in the Middle alum revealed that the producers of Dancing With the Stars have been trying to get him to compete on the show for more than a decade.
"I've been asked, I think, every year for the past 12 years," Muniz, 31, told Us at Planet Hollywood in New York City on September 6.
Now that he has finally committed to joining the season 25 cast, the actor is going to have to overcome some personal obstacles. "To be honest, my biggest fear is dancing in public," he admitted. "No joke. I want to because I love to dance in my room by myself, but if anyone is around, my body just doesn't move. It just doesn't."
Muniz has turned to previous competitors for advice. "I've had a bunch of friends that have done the show and everyone has said this is so much fun and it looks like a blast," he told Us. "Honestly, this last week of rehearsals has been amazing. I feel like I've learned a lot and I'm progressing."
The Emmy nominee's pro partner, Witney Carson, has been giving him some tough love already. "I told her when I met her, 'Don't go easy on me. Obviously I've never danced. If you tell me to do something, I don't know what it is,'" he said. "I'd rather it be serious, even though we have so much fun in the rehearsals. We are always laughing and joking around, but when it's time to dance, we get through it. I'll think I did good and she'll be like, 'Nope, your shoulders droop.' So we do it again. But I love it, I really do."
Though the season hasn't kicked off yet, Muniz and Carson, 23, are already trying to figure out who their biggest competition might be. "Nick Lachey," she predicted, while the Big Fat Liar actor joked, "All these people dance like they perform. I just sit at home and watch TV!"
Dancing With the Stars premieres on ABC on Monday, September 18, at 8 p.m. ET.

The Olympics are heading to Hollywood! The 2028 Olympic and Paralympic Games will be held in Los Angeles, the International Olympic Committee announced on Wednesday, September 13.
This is the first time the Olympics are being held back in the United State since the Games were hosted in Atlanta, Georgia, in 1996. L.A. has hosted the Olympics twice previously in 1932 and 1984, but this will be the first time the city hosts the Paralympics.
Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said, “This is a momentous day for the people of Los Angeles and the United States. For the first time in a generation, we are bringing the Games back to the City of Angels. L.A. loves the Olympics because the Games have lifted up our city twice before. But to us the Games have always represented an even brighter future and the chance to harness the power of sport and the Olympic Movement again to inspire the next generation – for the next 11 years and beyond.”
L.A. 2028 Chairman Casey Wasserman said: “This 11-year agreement with the IOC is the ultimate validation of L.A. 2028’s New Games for a New Era, and Los Angeles’ vision for the future. As a team and as a city, we could not be more excited to be entering into this long-term partnership with the Olympic and Paralympic movements, and with one of the great cities of the world, Paris. This will be an extraordinary collaboration that secures the future of the Movement for generations. Now L.A. 2028 has a golden opportunity, with four more years to prepare and a $2 billion contribution from the IOC, to redefine how hosting the Games can benefit host communities.”
It was also announced today that the 2024 Olympics will be held in Paris.

As the proverbial saying goes, Bachelor contestants just aren’t here to make friends.
That is, until they go to Mexico. Following a halt in production on season 4 of ABC’s Bachelor in Paradise, the cast was inevitably only given 11 days to potentially find love — and lust. But in the end, they scored something better than a Neil Lane sparkler: a new family, so says contestant Jack Stone.
“This has been such a tough season to go through for all the obvious reasons,” Stone exclusively tells Us Weekly. “So much could have gone wrong. This entire franchise could have gone under. So if the worst case scenario is that we all became friends and continue on that way in the real world, I think that’s great.”
Naturally though, the journey from start to finish had its dramatic moments. During his stay at the Playa Escondida resort, the Bachelorette season 13 alum witnessed DeMario Jackson and Corinne Olympios’ pool dalliance, romanced Christen Whitney — now infamously known as "Scallop Fingers" — and shot down twins Emily and Haley Ferguson. 
“Overall, Paradise was a crazy experience,” the single hunk, 32, says. “But we all became close friends, even family.”
The Dallas-based lawyer, who is very much not a serial killer, takes Us on another dramatic journey.
Us Weekly: Let’s start at the beginning. Did you suspect anything wrong between DeMario and Corinne on day one?
Jack Stone: That first day everybody was just overwhelmed. There was so much going on. No one really ate a lot, there was drinking and you’re also just meeting everyone. I wasn’t really paying attention to what was going on with DeMo and Corinne. I was trying to just get to know all the girls. I was like, "Oh, there’s a rose ceremony coming up!" I don’t think anyone noticed anything out of the usual.
Us: What ran through your mind when producers said they were turning off cameras and sending the cast home?
JS: Truthfully, I thought someone died. We were about to go to the rose ceremony. The producers came in, the cameramen were gone and they said, “We have to talk to you guys.” It was a really surreal moment. Everyone was like, “What is happening?” They were very vague and said, “Two people were involved in something.” We could tell who the two were because they weren’t there anymore. It was a weird experience to go through.
Us: How would you describe your connection with Christen?
JS: Christen has a good heart. She’s quirky. She came into all this drama pretty late in the game. I think she knew she was about to go home and I thought to myself, “She deserves a chance to see if there’s a connection here, whether it’s with me or someone else.” That’s why I initially gave her a rose. I just looked at her as a friend, although there were some things that you do with more than friends. Because it was so expedited, I didn’t to get to know her better.
Us: During your conversation on the finale, why did you decide to go your separate ways?
JS: At the end of they day, I was like, “Hey, I came here to see if I could have a connection with anyone and it would be great to stay in touch afterwards.” I thought we could leave as friends. We were the first couple to have this conversation about the next step so there was a lot of confusion about leaving together or separately. That’s when I said, "Can we redo this?"
Us: And just like that you were sent home?
JS: Someone had to go pack my bags for me and give me my stuff later in the day! It was so silly because here’s a girl that I wasn’t in love with. We thought that we could get in the car together as friends but then we were stopped in our tracks when we were talking about it.
Us: Do you see yourselves together post-show?
JS: I don’t think that there was anyone there that if I met them right now in my hometown I would say, “I really want to go out with you.”
Us: Do you still talk?
JS: Yes, we’re all friendly with each other. I don’t know anyone that isn’t talking to each other!
Us: Alright let’s talk twins. Why did you turn them down for a date?
JS: When the twins came in, I just got bad vibes from them. I didn’t care to go on a date with them and I don’t think they cared to go on a date with me. Why would I want to waste my time with them when I could spend my last night with guys and girls who actually came to be like family? Another part of the reason was because I wanted to get to know Christen more. I thought it would be the right thing to at least try.
Us: You’ve talked a lot about the bonds between everyone. Are the twins just as close with everyone, too?
JS: I think they’re off on their own. They alienated themselves. I think that people are tired of the antics. At this point, we’ve seen it already. It’s not funny anymore. The first day they got there I tried to be nice. They just weren’t there to make friends. It was very clear they were there to promote themselves. Arguably, a lot of people are, but at least put on a good face.
Us: Do you think Corinne was there to promote herself too? She did shout-out her clothing line on the finale!
JS: I don’t know what everyone’s agenda is for going on the show and I’m not going to speculate. Hopefully finding a connection with someone is on that list. But to say that’s No. 1 on the list is very far-fetched.
Us: Taylor [Nolan] and Derek [Peth] got engaged on the finale. How do you think their relationship will fare?
JS: Taylor and Derek have the best chance of anyone taking it to the next level after this season. Just the way they were around each other from the very beginning was so natural.
Us: How about Raven [Gates] and Adam [Gottschalk]?
JS: They get along great. They’ve been hanging out and traveling a lot together since the show. I hope it turns into something real and continues to go down that path.
Us: OK, big question: Are Danielle [Maltby] and Wells [Adams] friends…or something more?
JS: I think they’re just friends. I think they’ve had a really strong friendship for awhile but haven’t been romantically interested in each other. Obviously, there was a little spark there but they’ve kind of gone back to being friends, which I think is great.
Us: Would you do this all again?
JS: As of now, I don’t think so!

It’s serious! Big Brother’s Raven Walton has no doubts that she and Matthew Clines will remain close once they both return to the real world.
“Oh, goodness. My relationship with Matt is something special. We just clicked on many different levels. He wanted to know everything about my disease, he was there to console me when I wasn’t feeling well and he’s one of the best humans I’ve ever met,” the 23-year-old dance teacher exclusively tells Us Weekly.
“We were together in the house for 72 days. We couldn’t get enough of each other!” she adds. “We looked at each other like we were cake. People will have to stay tuned but I do believe we have a future outside of the house.” (Walton has been open about the gastric pacemaker she uses to treat her chronic illness, gastroparesis.)
Walton was evicted from the CBS show just one week after Walton, 33. They both will soon be in the jury house with fellow showmance couples Cody Nickson and Jessica Graf and Mark Jansen and Elena Davies.
As for which relationship will outlast the rest? “Definitely Matthew and I!” Walton says. “Jessica and Cody fought all the time! We were just the real showmance. We honestly liked each other a lot. We had to be around each other. I think Matthew and I will be a couple outside of this house.”
For more, read the rest of her Q&A below:
US: Did you really trust Paul Abrahamian? Do you think you could have beat him in final two?
RW: I really did trust Paul with my whole game. Honestly, I don’t think I would have beat him in final two and that is OK with me. My moral compass would not have allowed me to take anyone else to the final two. Even Matthew said, Paul and I needed to go to the end.  I would rather lose the game and keep my moral compass.
US: Did you think that Zingbot took it too far with his jokes?
RW: No, I don’t think so. It is what it is! Matthew and I were together all the time and we did everything together. He was like, ‘So you’re saying I won a hot girl? I’m fine with that.’
US: Matt sometimes teased how you mumble. Do you get that a lot from people?
RW: [Laughs] Yes, I do sometimes. It’s definitely the accent and I can talk very fast too.  When I get excited, it would all come out at the same time. Matthew would get me flustered and he enjoyed doing that and honestly it was funny to me too since I know I mumble. He said when I come visit him in DC he’ll have to be my translator.
Big Brother airs on CBS on Sundays and Wednesdays at 8 p.m. ET and Thursdays at 9 p.m. ET.

She’ll be bringing her A game! Sasha Pieterse is ready to hit the ballroom — and ready to bring the Mirrorball trophy home.
“I’m 100% competitive. Everyone has been so nice and friendly so that aspect I don’t think will change. But like, I’m going to win,” the Pretty Little Liars alum, 21, exclusively told Us Weekly at the season 25 announcement in NYC earlier this month.
“Sasha is a really hard worker. We literally will have no breaks,” her pro partner, Gleb Savchenko, chimed in. “We’ll go four hours, a straight four hours. She puts on her shoes and takes them off at the end of rehearsal. Standing in high heels.”
She’s already hurting from the strenuous workouts, though. “[I’m] so sore. Ice baths and sore in places that I didn’t even know were possible. That is a challenge, but I feel like it’s awesome and it’s conditioning,” she added to Us. “There is no turning back now, but I’ve been having so much fun.”
Pieterse’s parents were professional dancers, but says that she doesn’t have much experience herself. “I think I have rhythm but all of the technical stuff I don’t so Gleb has been helping me,” she explained. “He’s amazing. He’s such a great teacher and partner.”
Pieterse’s support system also includes her former PLL costars Lucy Hale, Shay Mitchell, Troian Bellisario and Ashley Benson. “I hope [they come],” she told Us. “Their schedules are crazy right now, but I know a bunch of them are planning to, so that will be fun. It’ll be like a little reunion.”
Season 25 of DWTS premieres on Monday, September 28, on ABC at 8 p.m. ET.

Back to the Upside Down! More trouble lies ahead for Will Byers (Noah Schnapp) on Stranger Things.
“Will Byers, who was sort of trapped in the Upside Down for most of season 1, now has a much more sinful role, which we’re really excited about,” co-creator Ross Duffer exclusively told Us Weekly at the Emmy Nominations for Outstanding Casting Cocktail Reception in Beverly Hills on September 7.
“Noah is just an incredible actor and he really didn’t get a lot to do season 1,” he continued. “So we’re excited about that.”
The Netflix smash left off with Will coughing up a slug-like being in the bathroom during Christmas dinner. Clearly not fully recovered from his Upside Down trauma, he kept the incident a secret from his family.
“It’s not too heavy, in terms of horror. So that’s why we wanted to push it a little bit. We’ve gotten the kids comfortable,” Matt Duffer told Us of what’s to come. On whether their goal is to freak out the young actors even more? “That’s the goal,” he added. “We’ll see if we’re successful or not.”
Last month, the Duffers revealed that they at one point thought of doing a time jump with the young actors. “The most shocking thing to me is how much these characters have aged,” Ross told Us. “Because when I go back and watch season 1, they look like tiny babies. So different from where they are now. It’s incredible how quickly the kids have grown up.”
Stranger Things also stars Winona Ryder, David Harbour, Millie Bobby Brown, Gaten Matarazzo, Caleb McLaughlin and Finn Wolfhard.
Season 2 of Stranger Things drops on Friday, October 27, on Netflix.

So in love! Jessie James Decker gushes over her husband Eric Decker's good looks in Us Weekly's exclusive sneak peek of the Wednesday, September 13, episode of Eric & Jessie.
"Now that I have a break in my practice schedule, I'm gonna jump on a plane, head down to Nashville and enjoy some family time," the Tennessee Titans wide receiver, 30, says in a confessional.
Ahead of his flight, he FaceTimes with his wife of four years. "You look so hot," the country singer, 29, gushes as Eric responds, "I did my hair for you."
"You ever get tired of me telling you that all the time?" Jessie quips to Eric, with whom she shares daughter Vivianne, 3, and son Eric Jr., 2. "I picked a good man to make babies with 'cause our babies are so cute."
The couple then reflect on Jessie's pregnancies. "I sure did get big when I was pregnant," she admits as the athlete responds, "The first one, with Vivianne, [you were a] big girl!"
"You liked it! It was more pushin' for the cushion. No, more cushion for the pushin'," Jessie says. "You liked that extra meat on me, didn't you? A lot more things to grab."
The "Wanted" singer then tells her hubby that their children are spending some time with her mother, Karen Parker, in Florida. "Vivi had a sandwich and a half," she boasts. After Eric says their little girl only ate half of the sandwich that he made for her the week prior, Jessie replies, "You're not a good sandwich maker. I just think Mama makes some really good sandwiches. Even when I'm around you won't let me make the sandwiches. You want Mom to make your sandwiches! She puts some cougar love in there for you."
Eric & Jessie airs on E! Wednesdays at 10 p.m. ET.

Mixing business with pleasure! Vanessa and Nick Lachey may be battling it out on Dancing With the Stars, but the couple swear that they aren’t competitive with each other.
“We are having fun doing this together. We’ve been doing this for 10 years so this is giving us a whole other dynamic in our relationship and I’m excited to see [what happens],” Vanessa, 36, exclusively told Us Weekly last week. “I’m proud of us for doing it together.”
The Lacheys did a spouse swap for the ABC show’s 25th season. While Vanessa is teamed with Maks Chmerkovskiy, Nick, 43, is partnered with the Ukrainian hunk's wife, Peta Murgatroyd.
“We don’t practice dancing with each other but it is nice because of the massages,” Vanessa told Us. “I’m like, I’ll rub your feet you rub my feet. That is fun. It really is another layer to our relationship. I can’t wait for the first live show, and I can’t to watch him. We did a little show the other day, we were at the same studio, and Maks and I came in and they showed us a little bit of their routine and we showed them a little bit of what we learned.”
She added: “It would be fun if we all made it to the finals.”
Vanessa admitted that she doesn’t really enjoy the gym, though. Luckily, Chmerkovskiy, 37, has no intention of pushing her to the extreme like her past “intense trainers.”
“It kind of seems childish. You have these grownups come, they signed on to do a show. It’s not like we’re in a summer camp together, and here I am making them do warmups and pushups and all that. It’s not me man,” he told Us. “I want to do my best and I want her to do her best too so we can do our thing. When I speed things up faster and faster, I know that there’s a leg that is able to do it. What is the point of pushing someone that I know for a fact that some of these people cannot be pushed? If you push, it’s going to break, and nobody wants that.”
Season 25 of DWTS premieres on Monday, September 28, on ABC at 8 p.m. ET.

No more friendship. Jason Dent has no kind words to say about fellow houseguest Paul Abrahamian — and he doesn’t think the jury house will either.
“I think he sabotaged himself. I think he’s toast now,” the rodeo clown, 37, exclusively tells Us Weekly. “I don’t think they’re going to vote to let him win.”
Dent has reason to be angry. The Iowa native was voted out of the Big Brother house in a blindside that left him speechless — literally. He stormed off past the cast without saying a word and got heated during his eviction interview with host Julie Chen.
Head of Household Christmas Abbott was the one to deliver the bad news as the tie breaker vote. As Dent would later learn in the goodbye messages, it was Abrahamian that schemed the plan. (Josh Martinez tearfully revealing the backstabbing idea in his message may have been his best move yet.)
“The only houseguest I needed to say something to was Christmas, and I just wanted to say, ‘Do not do this,’” Dent tells Us. “But I still thought, when it was 2-to-2, I thought, ‘You sly dogs, you really want to make this show-worthy to vote off Kevin [Schlehuber].’ But boy was I wrong. I had faith in my team until Christmas said my name. I thought I was safe.”
For more, read the rest of his Q&A below:
US: Did you think a blindside was going to happen when Josh started crying in the hot tub with you?
JD: That did cross my mind. I was wondering why. It really crossed my mind in the wave room the morning of the vote. I was wondering why he was saying he was lonely. In the hot tub, he said he was a big super fan and really understood the game and knew what he was doing and was putting on an act. I thought he was just saying that because everyone wants to believe they have some control. Then in the wave room I thought he was definitely coming unhinged.
I thought I’d need to do some buddy control, that what I needed to tell him was, ‘I want to take you to the final two.’ So he could feel included. I didn’t give him anything, so I figure he thought, ‘I’m voting you off.’
US: What’s the biggest game move you wish you would have made?
JD: I wish I would have put up Matt [Clines] and Raven [Walton] when I won my first HOH instead of Mark [Jansen] and Elena [Davies]. That wasn’t what I wanted to do, it’s what my pals wanted to do, and I should have done what I wanted.

Baby shower from hell! On the Monday, September 11, episode of Teen Mom 2, Briana DeJesus invited her ex-boyfriend to her baby shower — and her ex baby daddy Luis completely flipped out. Jenelle Evans also prepared to go back to court to fight her mom, Barbara Evans, for custody of her son Jace. Oh, and Kailyn Lowry might be headed back to court, too. Take a load off and catch up on the 5 biggest moments you may have missed!
Baby Shower Drama
Briana had to pretend she was still with Luis during her shower, but it didn’t last long. He rolled up to the party with two friends and a giant film camera, which Briana’s whole family agreed was “disrespectful.” The situation escalated when Briana’s ex-boyfriend Dre showed up to the party. Luis was beyond angry, but Briana couldn’t care less.
“Get the f--k out of here,” she screamed. “This is a sh-t show. I’m trying to pull my sh-t together.”
The day after the party, Briana told her extended family the truth that Luis cheated and that she thought about adoption. She could not help but bawl her eyes out. “You have us,” her aunt said. “We’ve dealt with bigger things.” At least she has her family by her side.
Jenelle’s Court Date Finally Arrives
Jenelle had barely seen her son Jace in weeks, and was ready to go to court and fight for her son. “I think, at this point, Jace feels really stuck in the middle,” Jenelle said.
Barbara was even more worried. "If she got him back or not … there’s no more relationship between us,” Barbara said. “I think it will ruin [his] life.” The show cut right as the two were walking into the courtroom, so fans will have to wait until next week to finally find out what happened.
Kailyn Might Be Headed to Court Again
Tensions were high between Kailyn and Javi Marroquin after he filed for child support, and she was already stressed enough with school and her pregnancy.
“Javi’s got the mental mind games,” Kailyn said. “I want to focus on graduating and having a baby.”
If things weren’t crazy enough, her other ex Jo Rivera revealed he might take Kailyn back to court to adjust their custody agreement. He’s worried about his son being dragged around to different houses due to Kailyn’s busy schedule, and wanted to make sure Isaac has some stability in his life.
“It’s been hard on him,” Jo said. “It really bothers me.”
Chelsea Has Mother-Daughter Time
Chelsea Houska had some one-on-one time with her daughter Aubree to make her feel special. Chelsea asked her daughter about what it’s like when she visits her dad Adam Lind, who recently tested positive for methamphetamines. Aubree admitted her dad sleeps a lot when she is there, and then asked Chelsea why her grandma always has to be there when she visits.
“Maybe, someday, that will change,” Chelsea said.
Leah Gets Her Daughter Some Assistance
Leah Messer finally got some relief after visiting the doctor with her daughter Ali last week. “I’m fighting for Ali. I’m going to do everything that she needs done,” Leah said. “It’s really taking an emotional toll.”
Tell Us: What did you think about the episode?
Teen Mom 2 airs on MTV Mondays at 9 p.m. ET.

It was the end of the road and time for the couples to formally couple up – or head home alone. On the Monday, September 11, Bachelor in Paradise finale episode, Chris Harrison popped in to remind everyone that they had the option to enjoy a fantasy suite date with their significant other. Daniel waited about point-five seconds before making sure Lacey was good to go. Spoiler alert: She was. “I’m in love with Daniel, for sure,” Lacey gushed to the camera. In the meantime, Jonathan and Jasmine amicably agreed they would just be friends.
Jack Stone Goes Home
Determined to make romance happen, the non-serial-killer Jack Stone pulled Christen aside to see where they stood. He told her he was excited to “get out of here hand-in-hand.” Christen seemed confused about the prospect of leaving as a couple. “I can’t leave her as a couple,” she laughed. “We are friends and at this point in time I feel like we are acquaintances.”
“Thank you. It’s a no,” she added to the camera. “Scallop Fingers out.”
Adam and Raven Hit the Fantasy Suite
Raven, meanwhile, had cold feet about hitting the fantasy suite with Adam since things hadn’t worked out well after she did that with former Bachelor Nick Viall. That didn’t mean she wasn’t going to go, though. “I am curious to see what happens tonight,” Raven said to the camera.
Dean Tells Danielle He Loves… Kristina
After telling Danielle that she was amazing, beautiful, and interesting, Dean told her that he realized that he cares a lot about Kristina – or, more specifically, that he loves her. Wait… what? “I don’t know. I think that you and I need to leave separately,” he said. “If you’re still in a place where you don’t know exactly what you want, you’ve got to figure it out on your own,” Danielle replied. He apologized “for being an idiot.”
Dean then cried to the camera about how it “killed” him that Kristina wasn’t there anymore. “Everything she’s ever done has been the more pure interaction,” he said. “I actually am in love with this girl, and I lost that to pursue something else.” Tears streamed down his perfect face as he confessed that he “literally” hated himself right now. He then apologized to Kristina and said she deserved better than him.
Diggy and Jaimi Don't Work Out
Love doesn’t work out for Diggy either. Diggy quickly  told Dominique that he thought it was best if they left separately  because he really liked Jaimi. (Well, he left that part out, but that  was clearly why.) Dominique wasn’t happy about it, but she wasn’t  heartbroken either.
Just then Jaimi wandered over and Diggy told  her he wanted to leave as a couple because he thought they could “build  something great” together. “I had a great time,” she said. “But today, I  think we need to just leave as friends.” Well, that was that.
Amanda Breaks Down in Tears
Robby  couldn’t wait to couple-up with Amanda after Paradise, but she didn’t  feel the same way. “I just like, honestly, don't see this working in  real life,” she said. “I just feel bad.” Robby’s face fell as she added,  “It’s not you. I think you’re such a great guy.”
Robby began to  tear up as he explained, “I wanted to leave with you, hand-in-hand.”  Amanda repeated how sorry she was – but her mind was made up.  “It makes  no sense,” a very confused Robby said to the camera before heading out alone.
Lacey and Daniel Make It Official (Kinda)
“As the days go by,  I’m starting to fall for you,” Daniel said. “So do you want to leave  here in a titled, committed relationship?” Lacey asked. He replied: “I don't want  you going back to New York this week and dating anyone, so that  definitely means that we should be in a relationship.” Then they decided  to stay in a fantasy suite together. “If he proposed I would say yes!”  she declared to the camera. “Nothing can go wrong. We are on cloud  nine.”
Flash forward to Lacey at  the reunion, where she told Chris and the rest of the world that Daniel  had apparently been lying about his feelings and told her the truth  during their night in the fantasy suite. Daniel insisted that he’d  backed off only because he was trying to be “realistic.” Chris then  rolled footage from the morning after their night together.
Taylor and Derek Have Sex
Derek  and Taylor decided they were close to falling in love and the best way  to seal the deal would be by having sex in the fantasy suite. Taylor was  looking forward to being able “to experience each other, but in a  different way.” Derek said he understood how  important sex was to Taylor and that if things went well in the fantasy  suite, they could be in love by the morning. He didn’t comment on what  would happen if things didn’t go well.
Corinne and DeMario Return – Again
Back in the studio, the  entire cast reunited, including Corinne and DeMario. They both agreed  that they were doing much better then just a few weeks ago. They also  had both been going to therapy. “I’m just trying to get back to my old  self, getting back into my fashion line designing,” Corinne said.  DeMario told Corinne he wished her “happiness” and hoped that one day  they would not “have that nasty cloud” over them. “I think that the  cloud has cleared. It is now sunny.” Then they hugged.
Dean Has Some Explaining to Do
It  didn’t take long for Kristina, Danielle and Dean to face off. “You two  should not be arguing with each other. It all falls on me,” Dean said.  He added that it was hard seeing her and that “those emotions are still  there.” Kristina said she hoped he never treated another woman the way  he treated her again. Danielle then revealed that he called her an hour  after they left Paradise. Oops.
On a happier note, Raven and Adam  revealed that they were still going strong. As a special treat, Raven  surprised Adam with her parents. Yes, he met her parents on live TV.
Derek and Taylor Get Engaged!
After  confirming they were still in total bliss, Derek had something to ask  Taylor. “You have such a big heart and you are absolutely stunningly  beautiful,” he said as he pulled her to her feet. “Taylor, I love you,”  he said. “I choose to love you in this  minute, this hour, this day, and every day from here on out. Will you marry me?” She said yes. Us Weekly exclusively confirmed their engagement late last month.

Just one face launched a thousand nightmares. But when unflappable It star Sophia Lillis first encountered Bill Skarsgård’s sinister Pennywise — a shape-shifting demon often masked as a clown — she, well, let out a laugh
“He didn’t notice because he had contacts in and couldn’t see me," the 15-year-old tells Us Weekly. "It was really funny!”
In fact, filming the remake about a band of teenage outcasts terrorized by Stephen King's creature was far from a horror show. “Behind the scenes, you get to see the process,” says Lillis, a Losers Club member in the flick. “It’s more interesting than scary.”
Her costar Finn Wolfhard would beg to differ. Recalls the 14-year-old Stranger Things actor: “I was like, ‘What did we get ourselves into?’”
The pair give Us a real scream.
Us Weekly: OK be honest, are you fans of horror movies?
Finn Wolfhard: Yes! Sophia laughs when we watch them. I just get super quiet, but I do love them.
Sophia Lillis: There are funny parts. You can always try to find the comedy in horror movies.
FW: It’s true, you can. Also, this movie is actually funny.
SL: There’s humor in it.
Us: How familiar were you with the original 1990 cult classic?
SL: I didn’t know much about the horror genre until after It and then I realized how big the fan base is! I read The Shining and watched the movie. I also read parts of It for the audition just so I could get to know my character and her relationship to the viewers.
Us: Was it hard not to bring this nightmare idea home with you every night?
FW: We knew that it was all fake in the moment. When we slept, we didn’t remember out dreams half the time because we were so tired!
SL: I never was actually scared when making It. 
Us: Did Bill ever try and scare you guys on set?
FW: He didn’t stay in character, thank God. That would be awful! In between takes, he was super supportive and wanted to make sure we were all OK.
Us: Favorite memory from filming?
SL: It was really fun to act with Bill Skarsgård. The way he plays Pennywise is so unique and very different from Tim Curry [who played the demon in the original]. He has to choke me multiple times in the movie. He’d have to put his arms around my neck but the cameras wouldn’t be on because they were looking to find the right shot. So his hands were around my neck and he’d be like, “How’s your day? How’s school? What’s it like being in high school now?” It was a little uneasy!
FW: The most fun for me was when we were filming in the water. We just got to swim and have fun and chicken fight.
SL: We got to know each other very well doing that scene! In a lot of the roles I play, I only do scenes with just myself or one other person. I never had to act with a group of kids. I’m glad to have this experience, especially because now I know how to act with other kids
Us: What was the dynamic like on set between the Losers Club?
FW: Honestly, we were all really close. We were lucky to have Sophia. She sat there and watched us go insane. She was super cool and never freaked out.
It is playing in theaters now.

Lady Gaga's upcoming Netflix documentary, Gaga: Five Foot Two, opens with a stunning shot of her suspended in the air for the entrance of her Super Bowl LI halftime show. From there, the film, which premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival on Friday, September 8, trails the pop star in the emotional year leading up to the release of her most recent album, Joanne.
From the first scene of the documentary, it's clear that Gaga's engagement to actor Taylor Kinney is unraveling. "Me and Taylor are fighting, so that sucks," she admits while cooking in her kitchen. Later on, after their July 2016 split, she breaks down in tears. "My love life has just imploded," she says. Still, the former couple appear to be cordial. On the day of her Super Bowl gig, she is shown receiving a bouquet of flowers from her ex-fiancé.
Five Foot Two also shows the 31-year-old singer's battle with chronic pain. She explains that she still suffers muscle spasms from the hip injury that forced her to cancel her 2013 tour, the Born This Way Ball. Sometimes the pain is so brutal that Gaga cries, though she makes sure to express her appreciation for her doctors and the team around her.
One of the most memorable scenes in the film comes when Gaga addresses her feud with fellow pop star Madonna. "She wouldn't look me in the eye and tell me that I was reductive," the "Poker Face" singer says, adding that she learned of the Queen of Pop's 2012 diss against her while watching TV. "Telling me you think I'm a piece of s--t through the media? It's like a guy passing me a note through his friend."
Gaga (real name Stefani Germanotta) then explains that Madonna, 59, was her idol "as an Italian who grew up in New York." She says the "Vogue" songstress has since apologized to her, but admits she's not sure if she can ever trust her again.
The documentary, which was directed by Chris Moukarbel, also gives an unfiltered look into the "Bad Romance" singer's life off the stage, including her goddaughter's baptism and a trip to Walmart to purchase her own CDs. The film ends with a dedication to Sonja Durham, Gaga's best friend who lost her battle with stage IV cancer in May.
Gaga: Five Foot Two premieres on Netflix on Friday, September 22.

Zoe and Lemon are back together — and not at war! Hart of Dixie costars Rachel Bilson and Jaime King reunited at the Self-Portrait Fashion Show in NYC on Saturday, September 9.
The O.C. alum, 36, shared a selfie of the pair on Instagram. "@mrselfportrait #nyfw #lemonlove," Bilson wrote.
In her own snap, King, 38, added: "Portraits with the women I [love] most at @mrselfportrait [love] Rach and I think Hart of Dixie needs to return. Who wants to make that happen?! #zoeandlemonforever."
Bilson and King played Dr. Zoe Hart and Lemon Breeland on the CW series, which ran for four seasons from 2011 to 2015. The beloved show also starred Friday Night Lights alum Scott Porter, Cress Williams and Wilson Bethel.
Bilson has also kept close with Hart of Dixie's set costumer Gelareh Khalioun. In March, she attended Khalioun's wedding at the Hummingbird Nest in Susana, California. "My beautiful baby bunns is married. I love you @gegelspot to the moon and back ❤❤❤ #gorgeousbride #youfancy," Bilson wrote on Instagram at the time.
The Nashville star, meanwhile, has yet to tie the knot herself. Bilson shares a daughter, Briar Rose, 2, with Hayden Christensen.

The first teaser trailer for Fifty Shades Freed was released on Sunday, September 10, and it reveals the wedding of Christian Grey and Anastasia Steele, but it’s not all champagne and canapes.
The final installment of the erotic trilogy based on E.L. James’ best-selling books sees Christian (Jamie Dornan) and Anastasia (Dakota Johnson) tie the knot but things quickly take a dangerous turn.
The one-minute-long teaser, which was released on Anastasia’s birthday, features the tagline “Mrs. Grey will see you now,” and opens with the couple exchanging vows.
“I solemnly vow to love you faithfully, forsaking all others,” Christian can be heard saying as Anastasia is buttoned into her wedding gown. “I promise to trust and respect you and to keep you safe for as long as we both shall live. All that I have is now yours.”
The scene then cuts to the newlyweds pulling up to a private jet.
“You own this?” Anastasia asks her new husband.
“We own this,” he smoothly replies with a smile.
We are then treated to a shot of Christian shirtless on the beach before a quick cut to Anastasia discovering a pistol in a desk drawer, followed by her expensive Audi being almost run off the road before she's grabbed from behind by a man wielding a large knife.
Fans of the erotic novels know the storyline, but those who haven’t read the books will have to wait to see what happens when the film is released on Valentine’s Day 2018.

The second time was not the charm. Emily and Haley Ferguson sat down with Us Weekly exclusively to reflect on their short-lived experience returning to Bachelor in Paradise for season 3 and admitted that they wish they could have done things differently.
The famous twins, 24, who vied for Ben Higgins’ affections on season 20 of The Bachelor, were excited to go back to Mexico for another shot at love — little did they know they’d be the last newcomers to arrive in Paradise. 
“We thought we were going to be [arriving] in the middle. So that’s why I was excited about going,” Emily told Us at the End of Summer Bachelor Party benefiting the Restore Dignity charity in Santa Monica on Wednesday, September 6. “The end is kind of just a disaster, because everybody’s coupled up. I definitely don’t think we would have gone if we knew we were the last. It’s too hard to consider getting into a relationship. I mean, I think everybody had their eyes set on Dean [Unglert] but I think we dodged a bullet there.”
The Las Vegas native explained that she and Haley regret the way they behaved on the beach. “Unfortunately, we looked terrible this season. I do wish that we could … I think we went into it and we were expecting it to be very similar to last season. We should have gone into it with a different perspective and a different outlook,” she continued. “I think we were hopeful of at least being able to go on one date, so I think we were really bitter that we didn’t even get to go on on a date.”
Chiming in, Haley added that the sisters wish they could rescind the negative remarks they made about their costars. Shortly after arriving in Mexico, the Bachelor in Paradise alums dubbed Danielle Lombard and Taylor Nolan “ugly, shallow wh—es” and coined franchise favorite Jack Stone as a “serial killer.”
“We said some really, really awful things that we wish we could take back,” Haley admitted. “So that’s the only thing that we would do differently.”
In agreement, Emily noted, “I also think that we thought we were being funny. But then looking back on it, it really wasn’t funny at all.” Haley clarified her sister’s remarks, telling Us, “If you know our personalities at all, you know that everything we were saying was meant to be lighthearted. We often times will often just make jokes, like, ‘Oh, you wh—e.’ Like, I don’t think people … It got perceived the total wrong way.”
“It looked bad,” Emily confirmed. “It looked bad and we apologized to all the girls that we hurt and we called names because that’s not fair. You should never tear down someone’s physical appearance.”
During their chat with Us, the twins also mentioned that they’ve reached out to their former BIP costar and close friend Nick Viall in the wake of his breakup from Vanessa Grimaldi.
“We’ve talked to Nick,” Haley noted. “We actually talk to him almost every day.” Emily added that the aspiring pilates instructors are in touch with Grimaldi as well. “I know they’re both going through a really hard time right now.”
“Especially because they’re both in the spotlight,” Haley further explained. “So it’s normal to break up. It’s such a normal thing but I think everybody’s making such a big deal out of it. And it’s so funny because I think a lot of people think they know [Nick and Vanessa’s] relationship, but nobody understands. They’re both great people and I really hope that people see that.”
Added Emily: “And they both deserve love.”
Us Weekly exclusively reported in August that the season 21 Bachelor “still loves” his ex-fiancee and the former flames are still very close.
As for the twins’ return to a Bachelor Nation show? “Hell no!” Haley said. “I don’t want to say never say never, but I mean after the way we kind of got portrayed this season, I don’t know. [We want to] become something other than just the Bachelor twins.”

Summer isn't technically over until September 21 — and certain ingredients are just reaching their peak. “The last heirloom tomatoes picked are always the best,” says chef Michael Hamilton of NYC’s the Flower Shop (Lenny Kravitz has dined there).
Since they started to grow midsummer, the multihued fruits have been “drenched” by the sun, he says, which boosts their flavor. Hamilton uses them in a riff on traditional panzanella, a Tuscan bread and tomato salad, and incorporates strawberries to highlight other seasonal produce.
Take this recipe to the next level with Hamilton’s quick tip: “Before ripping the basil, take the whole leaf and slap it between your hands as if you were clapping — it releases more of the herb’s oil and aroma.”
Tomato-Strawberry Panzanella
Serves 4
2–3 plump heirloom tomatoes
Sea salt and fresh-cracked pepper
10	strawberries
4	tbsp good olive oil
2	slices day-old country bread
1 	clove garlic
2	sprigs of basil
Handful of watercress
1/2	cup balsamic vinegar
Juice of half a lemon
Splash of red wine vinegar

The past is staying in the past. Dorit Kemsley revealed that her husband, PK, will be less involved in the forthcoming season of The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills following a dramatic incident that unfolded last season with costar Erika Girardi.
“I know he had a rough season. I think he took it well, he’s a big boy,” Kemsley, 41, told Us Weekly exclusively at Bella Magazine’s NYFW kickoff party on Wednesday, August 6, at The Attic Rooftop. “This season, I think that PK took a step back. He took a back seat and kept it simple.”
As previously reported, last season PK alleged that he caught a glimpse of Girardi, 46, while she wasn’t wearing underwear. On the season 7 reunion episode in April, the singer accused PK of saying he “quite like[d] the view,” although he denied having said so. “It’s very frustrating when you’re accused of something you didn’t do,” he fired back at the time.
Despite the war of words, Kemsley is standing by her husband. “The thing is, he and I always support each other,” she continued telling Us. “We’re partners in this life together. We roam through life together and we will be there for each other."
Although Kemsley played coy when asked if PK and Erika have made peace, she did tease what else fans can look forward to seeing on the upcoming season. “It had been five years since I put out a swim line and now the ideas are pouring out of me,” the fashion designer shared. “But you’ll see me trying to balance that with being a mom. It wasn’t easy for me to do as a career woman because I wasn’t a mother when I was doing my career before and I think I can do it.”

Kiss and tell! Tiffani Thiessen is spilling a Saved By The Bell secret to Us Weekly that’s been on our minds for quite some time. Who is the better kisser, Zack or Slater? Watch the video above!
Thiessen’s character Kelly Kapowski often found herself torn between Zack (Mark-Paul Gosselaar) and Slater (Mario Lopez) throughout the hit ’90s series and planted plenty of kisses on them both.
“That’s a hard one,” the Beverly Hills, 90210 alum, 43, tells Us Weekly. “I kissed probably Zack more so if you went with that answer, I guess.”
The actress, who said that her former costars are still close, also revealed that she may have taken a thing or two from the Saved by the Bell set.
“I took these old Levi’s, which are so ‘90s right now and everybody’s wearing those,” Thiessen revealed. “And everybody signed them.”
These days you will find Thiessen in the kitchen. The Dinner at Tiffani’s star teamed up with Uncle Ben’s for the Ben’s Beginners Cooking Contest, which challenges families to create lifelong memories in the kitchen. She’s gearing up to release her new cookbook, Pull Up a Chair.
“Its my connection of how I love bringing people in,” the White Collar Alum explained. “Whether it’s family or friends and really connecting over food.”
To find out Thiessen’s favorite recipes to cook with her two kids, watch the video above.


We’re not crying, you’re crying. Blake Shelton’s new track, “I’ll Name the Dogs,” is inspired by his romance with Gwen Stefani — and the music video features her children!
In the emotional video released on Friday, September 8, the country star, 41, portrays a wedding singer at the nuptials for an older couple who weds in the company of their children, grandchildren, family and friends.
At the reception following the ceremony, the 47-year-old “Rich Girl” singer’s oldest sons, Kingston, 10 and Zuma, 8, who she shares with ex-husband Gavin Rossdale, have an adorable cameo as they take to the dance floor dressed to the nines in suits. “The Sweet Escape” vocalist and Rossdale, 51, are also mom to Apollo, 2.
While The Voice coach and the “Hollaback Girl” songstress have no plans to walk down the aisle yet, the heartfelt song seems to serve as a nod to their love.
“Girl, it’s high time, I tell ya / No more messing around. Time to lay these cards on the table /A nd just throw it on out,” Shelton croons in the record. “I’m talking’ you and me with the same street name / Same last name. same everything. It’s a real thing, a how I feel thing / So I’mma go on and take a swing.”
The “Honey Bee” songster and the fashion designer met on the set of The Voice and Us Weekly exclusively revealed their relationship in November 2015. Although the couple has yet to announce their plans to tie the knot, multiple sources close to the “A Guy With a Girl” artist told Us in September 2016 that the duo “want to get married” very soon. “They are both very, very happy,” the insider confirmed. “Blake is having the time of his life with Gwen and feels so comfortable around her.”

Sam Smith is back, and his new music is more heartbreaking than ever. The British singer released his latest ballad, "Too Good at Goodbyes," on Friday, September 8.
"I'm never gonna let you close to me / Even though you mean the most to me," Smith, 25, croons on the track. "'Cause every time I open up, it hurts / So I'm never gonna get too close to you / Even when I mean the most to you / In case you go and leave me in the dirt."
The four-time Grammy winner explained the meaning behind the emotional single during an interview with Beats 1 host Zane Lowe. "This song is about me and about a relationship that I was in," he admitted. "I'm still very, very single. I think I'm even more single than I was when I released [my first album] In the Lonely Hour, so I'm insanely single. People are gonna see, this one as I've said, is about me and something that I've gone through."
The song is the first single from Smith's upcoming second album, which he confirmed is out later this year. The as-yet-untitled LP isn't entirely autobiographical, though. "This album actually is not all about me," he explained. "There's about four songs that are about me, and the rest are about different things and different people in my life and what they've gone through. ... I wanted to welcome people back in and I want it to be about my voice and about the storytelling of something that I've gone through."
"Too Good at Goodbyes" is the Oscar winner's first single since "Writing's on the Wall," the theme song for the 2015 James Bond film Spectre. In honor of his return to the scene, Smith will perform a series of intimate concerts in London, New York, Los Angeles and Berlin in the coming days.

Stock up on tissues now! This Is Us creator Dan Fogelman teased what's to come for the Pearson family — and its patriarch, Jack — while attending the Emmys' Outstanding Casting Cocktail Reception in Beverly Hills on Thursday, September 7.
"A lot of Jack stuff is coming," he exclusively told Us Weekly. "I keep saying, towards the end of the first episode, there’s a big piece of the puzzle that gets put out there. And in the course of the second season, I think all the questions that everybody’s asking right now are going to be answered."
Jack's (Milo Ventimiglia) backstory and the way he died won't be the only storyline. "[Kevin] has a very interesting storyline this year that I think is going to be surprising," Fogelman added of Justin Hartley's character.
As for matriarch Rebecca? Last season, several episodes centered on Rebecca (Mandy Moore) and Randall's (Sterling K. Brown) relationship. This time, however, there will be more of a focus on the mother-daughter duo Rebecca and Kate (Chrissy Metz).
"I think we’ve explored a lot of Randall and Rebecca already in the show, so we’re actually moving along — and while we’ll still continue to explore that relationship and what happened there, we’re actually doing a lot with Rebecca and Kate this year," Fogelman revealed. "Both in the past and in the present. But it’s not that one story stays and the other goes away; I was just editing an episode that’s very Rebecca and Randall heavy today. But yeah, we’re trying to focus on all the relationships between all the kids and both parents."
He added: "[Kate's] grown up in the shadow of her statuesque mother who sang, and she’s trying to sing. So there’s a lot of complicated stuff that we’ll be diving into."
Season 2 of This Is Us premieres on Tuesday, September 26, on NBC at 9 p.m. ET.

She’s in it to win it! Miley Cyrus dished on her goals for season 13 of The Voice in an NBC clip shared exclusively with Us Weekly.
“I am so happy to be back on The Voice, especially because I feel like I learned a lot last season, the “Malibu” crooner, 24, gushed in the sneak peek released on Friday, September 8. “With experience, I can navigate the show a little bit better.”
The former Disney star, who joined the singing competition show in 2016 for season 10, is committed to her craft. “I have a note written down because I believe in putting things into the universe,” she explained. “And my note to myself is, ‘I’m going to win.’ And that’s my goal this time.”
Cyrus also revealed her main objective— going head to head with veteran judge Blake Shelton. “This season, I really want to snag a good country artist from Blake. I think if anyone can do it on the panel, it would be me,” the Happy Hippie Foundation founder boasted. “I try to remind people that I was actually born and raised in Nashville, Tennessee.”
“The most important thing to me in my life is my family and being on the farm, being home and music. Family, farm and music. That is my life, my life revolves around it,” the “Wrecking Ball” songstress continued, adding, “And glittery jeans.”
The “Younger Now” singer then reflected on her experience on The Voice so far and how her coaching mechanisms will change this season. “I don’t think I realized when I started season 11 how much you create a relationship with the artists that are on your team,” she said. “I think I bring a lot of value as a coach because I’m willing to take the time, overtime, to work with my artists. I feel like, being back, I have some different ways that I could win the show.”
Season 13 of the reality talent show, which also stars coaches Adam Levine and Jennifer Hudson, premieres on Monday, September 25, on NBC.

The club is back! A reboot of the Mickey Mouse Club, which premiered in 1955 on ABC and launched the careers of stars such as Ryan Gosling, Britney Spears, Justin Timberlake and Christina Aguilera, is premiering on Friday, September 8.
But the new version has some twists — it will be a strictly digital and social media show called Club Mickey Mouse, and there will be a brand new theme song. “Over the course of seven weeks, they will share their journey on the @ClubMickeyMouse Instagram and Facebook accounts through Instagram stories, Boomerangs and Facebook Live videos, as they document the behind-the-scenes process of writing their own songs, choreographing their dances, and their experiences on set,” a press release explains. “Each week will culminate in a unique musical performance and a marquee music video. Walt Disney Records will also distribute the original music weekly through online music stores, including a new Club Mickey Mouse theme song which will be released on September 12, 2017.”
Todrick Hall, who most recently choreographed Taylor Swift’s record-breaking video “Look What You Made Me Do,” will join the Club as a mentor, along with Alisha Marie, a social media influencer with more than 3 million followers. The cast of new Mouseketeers includes teens Regan Aliyah, Jenna Alvarez, Ky Baldwin, Gabe De Guzman, Leanne Tessa Langston, Brianna Mazzola, Sean Oliu and Will Simmons.
“From the original cast of Mousketeers to the pop power of the 1990’s Mickey Mouse Club, this franchise has always discovered, nurtured, and incubated original talent who have gone on to do great things and make a real impact on culture,” said Andrew Sugerman, Executive Vice President of Publishing and Digital Media at Disney. “We’re excited to continue that legacy and to welcome the Mousketeers into our network of Maker creators, support their crafts as authentic songwriters, choreographers, and artists, and bring a new generation of teens back into the Club.”

It's all happening! A celebrity edition of Big Brother is officially coming to CBS this winter. Host Julie Chen announced the news during the live double eviction episode on Thursday, September 7.
"Big Brother has been dominating pop culture throughout its 19 seasons, and it is exciting to grow the franchise with the first-ever celebrity edition in the U.S.," executive producers Allison Grodner and Rich Meehan said in a statement. “Celebrities will be under the watchful eye of the Big Brother cameras, facing the classic game elements, and of course new twists in this special winter event.”
Don't worry, though! Big Brother will also resume for another season in summer 2018.
Chen, 47, whose husband is CBS CEO Leslie Moonves, opened up about the addition in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter.
“He said, 'You and your show are single-handedly keeping this network afloat during the summer. You’re keeping this network running,'" the Talk cohost recalled. "If you know one thing about my husband, it has to make economic sense. They crunched the numbers and said, 'Based on the following we have, we can do it and make it work and make it profitable.'"
The network most likely won't have a tough time finding a cast. Saturday Night Live alum Bobby Moynihan revealed what a huge fan he is when he visited the houseguests while promoting his new show, Me, Myself & I, earlier this week.
As always, expect the unexpected!
Big Brother airs on CBS on Sundays and Wednesdays at 8 p.m. ET and Thursdays at 9 p.m. ET.

Jessie James Decker is confident in her relationship — and doesn’t think her show, Eric & Jessie, will have a negative impact on her marriage to NFL star Eric Decker.
“I don’t worry about that just because I think it’s like 60 percent of Americans are getting divorced,” she exclusively tells Us Weekly. “You just happen to catch some of them on TV. So I don’t think it has anything to do with that. [Laughs] I just think there are some couples who just don’t work out.”
Many couples have divorced after starring on the small screen together, including Jessica Simpson and Nick Lachey, Kate and John Gosselin and Britney Spears and Kevin Federline.
Jessie, 29, and Eric, 30, however, are still going strong. They are back for season 3 of their E! series, which premiered on Wednesday, September 6. The new episodes will focus more on their careers and include adorable moments between their two children — Vivianne, 3, and Eric II, 2, who is lovingly nicknamed “Bubby.”
“They are best friends. They really are. They are so cute together,” Jessie tells Us. “I always knew I was nurturing and I have such a good mom myself so I learned from the best. I think what surprised me — and maybe not surprised me but I had to learn quickly — there is no room to be selfish when you become a mother. It is not about you anymore.”
Luckily, she has a solid partner to coparent with. “Eric is the best. I know women say that about their husbands all the time, but I cannot stress it enough. He’s honestly the best. He just blows me away every day. He just doesn’t do anything wrong. I remember back in the day when we started [dating] I would snoop and try to find anything and he’s just awesome. He’s an amazing person,” Jessie gushes. “He’s a very selfless father. And if I was a bum mom and didn’t do anything he would take over with no problem. I think the kids would still be fine.”
She adds: “We are still madly in love with each other and I’m crazy about him. I can’t imagine not being that way.”
According to Jessie, she and Eric have “never had problems” — before or after their June 2013 nuptials.
“I know some people probably get frustrated when I say that and they don’t think that’s authentic or they don’t think that’s real, but we truly didn’t. What is there to argue about when you are 23 and 24 and you’ve been together for two years? That’s the honeymoon stage! If you’re already having problems and bickering and fighting you probably are not in the right relationship in my opinion,” she explains to Us. “We truly were a perfect match. The little things didn’t matter and now that we are parents and we have these jobs —that’s when those things test you. And so if you already had a rocky relationship before those things happened that’s going to be a tough one … We are unfazed and ready because we already have a great foundation.”
Eric & Jessie airs Tuesdays on E! at 10 p.m. ET.

She’s in! Shailene Woodley opened up about her potential interest in appearing in a second season of HBO’s Big Little Lies in the October Issue of Marie Claire U.K. magazine. 
“I haven’t heard anything, but of course I’d do it,” she told the publication." It would be so fun.”
The miniseries, which also stars Reese Witherspoon, Nicole Kidman, Zoe Kravitz and Laura Dern, left off with the school moms covering up the murder of abusive husband Perry Wright (Alexander Skarsgård).
And while the wildly popular series hasn’t officially been renewed, the 25-year-old actress is interested to see where her character Jane Chapman ends up after surviving sexual abuse from Skarsgard’s character.
“I think it would be interesting to explore the psychological trauma she’s undergoing post seeing him,” Woodley explained to the mag. “I think there’s an assumption that these things are quick to heal once you begin therapy or once you have that closure. But these are lifelong pains that you’re constantly working through.”
The Divergent actress isn’t the only cast member to speak of a possible second season.
In a Thursday, September 7 appearance on Good Morning America, Witherspoon, 41, who also executive-produced the show, discussed the possibility, saying:"We’re talking about it. We had so much fun and literally this group of women are my closest friends and we’re thinking about it. We’re talking about it.There’s only one book and it ended where the show ended. We gotta get the writer to write another book."
Liane Moriarty, who wrote the book the series was based off of is also toying with the idea of a second season.
"I have started to think about ways this could continue. The producers have asked me to see if I can come up with some ideas. I wouldn't write a new book but perhaps a new story and then we'll see what happens," she explained to The Sunday Morning Herald in April. "I'm absolutely open to it because, once I started thinking, it was too much fun to see what I could do and to see these characters again. And there's definitely places you can go."
HBO programming president Casey Bloys shared the network's thoughts on renewing the series for a second season in July.
"Liane taking her crack at it and I think that it's interesting," he said. "I don't think [there's been] a time when we've gone to the writer of the novel, the source material, to come up with like, ‘Do you see ongoing stories?' I'll be very curious to see what she comes up with that. Normally you go to a TV writer, and say, ‘What do you see?'"
The Big Little Lies finale aired on April 2 and received a whopping 16 Emmy nominations. Witherspoon and Kidman are both nominated in the Outstanding Lead Actress in a Limited Series or Movie category. Woodley, Dern and Skarsgård were also nominated, with the show earning a nom for Outstanding Limited Series too.

Drama! Music video director Joseph Kahn thinks Beyoncé copied Taylor Swift’s video for “Bad Blood,” and not the other way around. The director is defending himself after Beyoncé’s fans claimed that he and the "Out of the Woods" singer copied some aspects of the “Formation” video for their “Look What You Made Me Do” clip.

During his Thursday, September 7, interview with the Los Angeles Times about his new film, Bodied, Kahn, 44, opened up about his Twitter feud with the Beyhive and continued to defend his work.
“It’s not ‘Formation’ at all,” he told the newspaper about Swift's latest video. “They try to say she’s wearing a black crop top and Beyoncé wore a black crop top. But they don’t realize in 2015 in ‘Bad Blood,’ Taylor Swift was wearing a black crop top. I really do think, by the way, that Beyoncé copied ‘Bad Blood.’”
After the “LWYMMD” video dropped at the 2017 MTV Video Music Awards on August 25, Kahn spoke out on Twitter the next day to address the accusations that he had copied the “Sorry” singer. “I’ve worked with Beyoncé a few times,” he wrote. “She’s an amazing person. The #LWYMMDvideo is not in her art space. Love and respect to Bey.” 
The scene that had people making the comparison was one that shows Swift lined up next to her male backup dancers while wearing all black, similar to what Beyoncé did for her Lemonade album’s visuals. 
The video director has also been addressing his feud with the Beyhive on social media while he promotes his new movie. He shared the LA Times article on Twitter, writing: “Come get it Beyhive 🐝🐝🐝🐝. The candy is right here.”
Beyhive is the official street marketing team for BODIED. Thanks! 💋🐝 https://t.co/qEmTYKAFQ6
"Beyhive is the official street marketing team for BODIED. Thanks!" he wrote. Not long after, he revealed tickets for his movie's premiere were sold out.
Kahn previously directed Swift’s videos for “Bad Blood,” “Blank Space,” “Wildest Dreams” and “Out of the Woods,” and he worked with Beyoncé on Destiny’s Child’s “Say My Name” and “Jumpin’ Jumpin’.”

On the run! Zayn Malik premiered the music video for his new single “Dusk Till Dawn” featuring Sia on Thursday, September 7, off his upcoming sophomore album. The singer teased the arrival of his new visual on Twitter on Friday, September 1, revealing that he'd star alongside Girls actress Jemima Kirke.
The former One Direction member took to social media to share his excitement with his followers. “Hope you enjoy it as much as I did making it,” the star wrote to his fans.

Kirke shared her reaction to the video’s release on Twitter, sharing a video of herself eating cereal and singing along to the song. She wrote, “How are you celebrating the release of @zaynmalik new video?” The singer replied to her post saying, “My Mornings...similar.”

The action-packed video follows the couple as they carry two different briefcases and try to escape from the authorities who are chasing after them. Kirke’s character hides her identity with a black wig and glasses, as Malik’s character follows her and is eventually taken in for questioning.
The police officer says, “I know who you are” and Zayn replies, “You don’t know me.” The cops search through the singer’s briefcase and find nothing but clothes, and compare his hand tattoos with the tattoos of the person they’re after. They eventually realize they have the wrong guy and let him go., “I know who you are” and Zayn replies, “You don’t know me.” The cops search through the singer’s briefcase and find nothing but clothes, and compare his hand tattoos with the tattoos of the person they’re after. They eventually realize they have the wrong guy and let him go.
The singer then gets into a high-speed chase in his Jaguar with another group of bad guys as he races to be by his girl’s side. Malik’s character makes a clean getaway through a hole he dug in the ground of a house and reunites with his girl and they drive away together.
Although Sia did not appear in the video, a fan made an edit of the "Pillowtalk" singer wearing the "Chandelier" singer's iconic wig, saying, "Are you gonna perform #DuskTillDawn like that? @zaynmalik"

Showtime! As he’s gearing up for his stint on Dancing With the Stars, Nick Lachey spoke to Us Weekly to dish on how he’s preparing for the role.
The ‘90s pop-star revealed that he and pro-partner Peta Murgatroyd may perform a dance number to a song from Lachey’s hit band, 98 Degrees! “You gotta pull out every weapon you have. The 98 Degrees weapon might rear its ugly head,” the “What’s Left of Me” songster, 43, told Us at Planet Hollywood in New York City on Wednesday, September 6. “I can’t believe a 98 Degrees song hasn’t been on the show already.”
The former boy band lead singer also explained that his experience in the spotlight has somewhat helped him prep for the gig. “I mean, I think performing experience definitely helps when you’re trying to play a crowd. But at the end of the day, we didn’t really do much dancing to be honest with you. I don’t feel like I really have any leg up there. I’m coming into this eyes wide open,” he said. “I’m going to work my ass off. I got a great teacher and we’re just gonna go for it and see where it takes us. Obviously, we all wanna win. Coming into any competition, I want to win.”
Lacey also opened up about his competitive nature. “At the same time, I think the competition is really within yourself,” he continued. “You don’t ever want to look back and think, ‘I didn’t give it everything I could have given it.’ If i look back no matter what the result being if I get a MirrorBall Trophy or we don’t, if I can look back and say I worked my ass off, I gave it everything I had, what else can you do? The results will be what the results will be.”
The Charmed alum’s wife, Vanessa Lachey, will also be competing on the talent show, partnering up with Murgatroyd’s hubby, Maksim Chmerkovskiy. “I think the best case scenario is we all make it to the final and then the gloves come off and we get serious,” Lachey said of his plans to go head-to-head against Vanessa, 36. “Up until then, what’s wrong with supporting each other? This is a tough road. It’s a long road. It’s a hard road. I’m going to take all the support I can get. It’s nice to come home and know that your wife is going through the same kind of day you have and can relate to the challenges that you’re dealing with.”
In agreement, series veteran Murgatroyd, 31, told Us, “I think it’s almost beneficial in a way because Maks and I are in the kitchen together and creating the moves for Nick and he as my best interest at heart and I do for him. I think we just help each other a lot — all four of us.” 
Dancing With the Stars returns to ABC on Monday, September 18, at 8 p.m. ET.

Zach Braff is looking for love on The Bachelor — sort of. The Scrubs star tweeted a photo of newly announced Bachelor Arie Luyendyk Jr. on Thursday, September 7, joking that he was chosen to be the new star of the show since there's a strong resemblance between them.
The Bachelor page shared a photo of Luyendyk to announce the news to fans, writing: “Bachelor Nation, start your engines! We are proud to announce the next Bachelor will be....@ariejr! 🌹🏁🌹”
Bachelor Nation, start your engines! We are proud to announce the next Bachelor will be....@ariejr! 🌹🏁🌹 pic.twitter.com/PTCKToIIrM
Braff then shared the same photo with his followers writing, “I can't believe I'm the Bachelor! I didn't even audition,” the actor joked. “Looking forward to the fantasy suites.”
pic.twitter.com/iMEk2324VE
Braff and Luyendyk may have similar features such as their dark brown hair, blue eyes and fair skin, but the actor won't be the one handing out roses on the show anytime soon. Luyendyk was revealed as the next season 22 Bachelor during Good Morning America on September 7. "It sunk in just now for sure, it's been a little surreal," the 35-year-old said on GMA. "I was a little skeptical just because we had been in talks for a few years about doing it so I just kind of went in with an open heart and just kind of hit me right now I'm here."
The reality star admitted that this was the perfect time for him to be on the show. "I was at home and it was pretty recent and we kept in touch over the last few years but this just fit perfectly. The timing really fit," he said. "I kind of kept things under wraps because I didn't know how this would turn out. It's been such a quick turn of events and my family doesn't know so now they know so they know along with you guys."
Although Luyendyk was the runner-up on Emily Maynard's season 8 of The Bachelorette in 2012, some fans were still surprised that ABC cast him as the reality show’s next star.
Take a look at some of the best fans’ reactions to the announcement below:

Ah yes, Arie Luyendyk is the next Bachelor... pic.twitter.com/mhfUiOF6wJ
So I understand ABC wanting to pick Arie, but unless you've been watching since Emily's season like I have, people have NO IDEA who he is.
Ok but really who is Arie Luyendyk Jr??? #TheBachelor pic.twitter.com/mzLTwSseMj

He’s not mincing words. Kid Rock called out Nazis, the KKK and political correctness during a show at Van Andel Arena in Grand Rapids, Michigan, on Wednesday, September 6.
The 46-year-old performer, who previously confirmed his interest in challenging Democratic Senator Debbie Stabenow in the 2018 Michigan midterm elections, performed three songs before delivering his politically charged speech while standing at a podium outfitted with a logo that resembled the presidential seal.
"Think you have to remind me that Black Lives Matter? Nazis, f--king bigots and now the KKK? I say screw all of you a--holes, stay the f--k away,” Rock, whose real name is Robert James Richie, exclaimed.
He added: “It's no secret we're divided and we all should take some blame. We should be ashamed that we all seem scared to call him by his name."
The performer concluded his message with this line: ”If 'Kid Rock for Senate' has got folks in disarray, wait 'til they hear 'Kid Rock for President of the U.S.A.'!"
While the “Cowboy” singer has not filed papers to confirm his election bid for the U.S. Senate seat, he has suggested his commitment through his newly created political website.
But there might be a bump along the road for the singer-turned-potential politician. As previously reported, nonprofit organization Common Cause filed a complaint against the “I Am Bullgod” rapper on September 1, alleging that he’s been campaigning for Senate without registering with the FEC.
“I am starting to see reports from the misinformed press and the fake news on how I am in violation of breaking campaign law,” the singer said in a statement to TheWrap on September 1.
He continued: “No. 1: I have still not officially announced my candidacy. No. 2: See #1 and go f--k yourselves.”

Are you ready for it? Taylor Swift is all of us in her new commercial for AT&T’s DirecTV Now.
In the clip released on Thursday, September 7, fans are afforded a glimpse at the 27-year-old Grammy winner’s daily routine. The video begins as the “Style” songstress tunes her guitar in the studio. When noticing her cat Olivia in the corner, Swift crawls over to pet and cuddle with the feline.
Soon after, the former country crooner takes a break from the recording studio to indulge in a healthy snack and take a quick — and distracting — phone break. As the “Look What You Made Me Do” singer walks down the hall back to her workspace, she encounters Andy Samberg.
The two exchange a few snarky jabs before Swift tells the Saturday Night Live comedian, “Whatever, Andy Sam-jerk.” The A-listers proceed to have an intense stare-down, compete as caricature artists and end their feud with an “unbelievable choreographed fight sequence” in slow motion. The Hotel Transylvania actor asks the “Blank Space” artist for a timeout, but she kicks him into a wall instead!
After an exhausting fight scene, Swift treats herself to cookie dough before finding her way back to the studio. The commercial ends by teasing a new Taylor Swift song that we, sadly, didn’t get to hear.
“We’re shooting in these kind of fake sets and basically we’re doing this thing where like it’s a day in the life of me. I was really-method acting, I was actually eating the dough each time, so If I have to, you know, I’ll eat the prop food,” the “I Don’t Want to Live Forever” artist joked in a behind-the-scenes video.
Swift’s sixth studio album Reputation drops on Friday, November 10, and is now available for preorder.

Arie Luyendyk Jr. nailed his Bachelor audition. The race car driver, who was runner-up on Emily Maynard's season 8 of The Bachelorette, had an open and honest conversation with ABC producers about his love life before his new gig was revealed on Good Morning America.
"ABC sat with Arie and it was really great to catch up and see where he was in his life," a source exclusively tells Us Weekly. "And he told them he hadn't been in love since Emily and he was so sincere about finding a woman to complete his life, they knew that was their Bachelor!"
Maynard, meanwhile, still speaks fondly of him. "I can't think of a better person to be The Bachelor than Arie and I've been hoping this day would come since Season 8 ended!" the 31-year-old exclusively told Us on Thursday, moments after his new title was announced. "He's a gentleman through and through and all the girls on his season are lucky to have him."
Luyendyk Jr., 35, was previously linked to Courtney Robertson, too. The Bachelor season 16 winner, 34, revealed that they they even hooked up last year.
"I adore Arie," Robertson exclusively told Us in February 2016. "He's a great friend who I like to make out with from time to time!"

The Real Housewives of New York City star Luann de Lesseps can pinpoint the exact moment she knew her seven-month marriage to Tom D’Agostino was over.
“It was, like, the week before the reunion basically, and Tom went out and he called an old girlfriend and they met up with a group of people, and I didn’t know about it until I found out about it the next day in the press,” de Lesseps told Andy Cohen in a “One-On-One” episode of Watch What Happens Live on Wednesday, September 6. “That, for me, was the final straw.”
The former couple’s drama was an ongoing storyline on the Bravo reality series. On the show’s May 24 episode, Dorinda Medley, Bethenny Frankel and Carole Radziwill warned de Lesseps that there had been rumors of infidelity by D’Agostino. But the 52-year-old didn’t want to hear it. “I’m totally, 100 percent sure about Tom,” she insisted on the show. “And that’s all that matters.”
Now, de Lesseps wishes she had listened. The mom of Victoria, 22, and Noel, 20, (with ex husband Count Alexandre de Lesseps) admitted during her sit-down with Cohen that she failed to see the “red flags” until it was too late. “I had that moment of ‘Oh my god,’ I had these blinders and all of a sudden they came off,” she revealed. “I thought, ’This is not good.’”
She continued: “I don’t think he could give up his bachelor life to lead a married life the way I wanted to. I think that he really loved me. I really do. He still loves me. At this age, it’s really hard to change people . . . I expected more. I expected him to change.”
Despite the persistent rumors that plagued their relationship, de Lesseps is insistent that the 50-year-old businessman never cheated. “I totally believe he was faithful,” she said. “He’s a flirty guy, he’s a social guy, and I think people take that the wrong way sometimes, but it’s not a good look.”
But she doesn’t blame D’Agostino for the breakup. “It takes two to tango,” she noted. “It was a bad situation that was not going to get any better.”
Meanwhile, D’Agostino is also taking the high road. “There was a real love lost there,” he exclusively told Us Weekly on September 6. “I’m saddened and I wish Luann only the best.”

Emily Maynard is ecstatic that ex Arie Luyendyk Jr. is the season 22 Bachelor.
"I can't think of a better person to be The Bachelor than Arie and I've been hoping this day would come since Season 8 ended!" Maynard, 31, exclusively tells Us Weekly in a statement. "He's a gentleman through and through and all the girls on his season are lucky to have him."
She adds: "I'll be wishing him nothing but the best because that's absolutely what he deserves!"
Luyendyk Jr., 35, was Maynard's runner-up in her season 8 of The Bachelorette in 2012. She chose Jef Holm, but the pair split in October 2012.
This is happening! #TheBachelor
A post shared by Arie 🏁 (@ariejr) on Sep 7, 2017 at 5:45am PDT
ABC officially (and finally!) revealed that Luyendyk Jr. would be the next hunk to hand out roses during Good Morning America on Thursday.
"The timing really fit," the race car driver said. "I kind of kept things under wraps because I didn't know how this would turn out. It's been such a quick turn of events and my family doesn't know so now they know so they know along with you guys."
Luyendyk Jr. had been keeping quiet on social media leading up to the news. He last posted on Instagram on July 27, but returned on Thursday after the reveal. "This is happening! #TheBachelor," he captioned a pic of himself at GMA.

Swoon alert! Arie Luyendyk Jr. was finally revealed as the season 22 Bachelor during Good Morning America on Thursday, September 7.
"It sunk in just now for sure of the it's been a little surreal," the 35-year-old said on GMA. "I was a little skeptical just because we had been in talks for a few years about doing it so I just kind of went in with an open heart and just kind of hit me right now I'm here."
Even his loved ones didn't even know he was the next Bachelor before the big reveal. "I was at home and it was pretty recent and we kept in touch over the last few years but this just fit perfectly. The timing really fit," he said of when he got the offer. "I kind of kept things under wraps because I didn't know how this would turn out. It's been such a quick turn of events and my family doesn't know so now they know so they know along with you guys."
Luyendyk Jr., who was the runner-up on Emily Maynard's season 8 of The Bachelorette in 2012, nearly landed the Bachelor title last year. He was also up against Luke Pell, who appeared on JoJo Fletcher's Bachelorette season. Pell claimed that he had his bags packed but ABC producers changed their minds last-minute.
"Same exact deal. I just knew two days prior, but same deal: suit fittings; contracts that I signed, but they were delayed on signings on their end; booked flights. Maybe this is a common practice now to throw off fans — I don’t know," Luyendyk Jr. exclusively told Us in September 2016.

Although Maynard chose Jef Holm in the end (the pair ended their engagement shortly after the finale), she had strong feelings for the racing driver.
"She was truly in love with two good people. It wasn't clear-cut," a source exclusively told Us in 2012.
Maynard has since moved on from Holm. Late last month, her husband, Tyler Johnson, announced that they are expecting their third child together. The couple are parents of sons Jennings Tyler, 2, and Gibson Kyle, 11 months, and Maynard is mom of daughter Ricki, 12, from a previous relationship.

He’s coming! Bill Skarsgard hit the red carpet at the Hollywood premiere of his new movie It on Tuesday, September 5, and talked to US Weekly about how it was to transform into his character — the horrifying clown, Pennywise.
The Allegiant star revealed how it felt to see himself as the iconic clown, saying, “It was an amazing, terrifying feeling of seeing the makeup go on for the first time.”
“Up until that point, I didn’t know what the character actually would look like. So every step of the way, I was looking at myself in the mirror, making faces to try to see what this character would eventually be,” he added.
The movie is hitting theaters on Friday, September 8, and it's an adaptation of Stephen King’s 1986 novel of the same name and follows the TV miniseries that aired in 1990 starring Tim Curry as Pennywise. Skarsgard felt the pressure of filling Curry’s shoes but he told Us he hopes to bring something unique to the role.
“Tim Curry’s performance was amazing. It was such a good interpretation of Stephen King’s character in the book,” he said. “We were making a new film, a new adaptation of the book. Of course, I wanted to bring something different and unique to it. Otherwise, I don’t see the point in remaking something. I hope that people can consider both performances separately and appreciate them for what they are.”
Once he landed the role, the actor, 27, admitted that he felt a bit of self-doubt, and didn’t want to disappoint the film’s director Andrés Muschietti and producer Barbara Muschietti.
“I think the first step was there were people who had to be convinced that I could do the job. There was a long process of getting cast. Once I got the role, I was like, 'I got the role!' Then I was like, 'Oh my God, I got the role. How am I going to do this? How am I going to live up these expectations?'” he confessed. “Andy and Barbara, the director and producer, trusted in me, and I really didn’t want to let them down. It was a mixed feeling, but ultimately, of course, I loved the whole thing.”
Skarsgard believes there's still a need for horror films for people to escape the reality of what is happening in the world at the moment.
“I think the world seems to be a very scary place now. More so than ever. Watching a scary movie, you get scared, but it’s safe. There is no real Pennywise, but there are a lot of real scary things going on in the world,” he said. “I don’t know if people are into horror films now more than ever. But I feel that’s what horror films do. You go to see something that’s pretend, and you get scared but it’s not real life. It’s a good feeling."
It hits theaters this Friday, September 8.

From rose ceremonies to reality! Bachelor in Paradise couple Raven Gates and Adam Gottschalk are still together post-Paradise, Us Weekly can exclusively confirm.
The reality stars started dating on the ABC dating spinoff after meeting in Texas during the two-week production halt. Although Gottschalk, a castoff from Rachel Lindsay’s Bachelorette season, entertained a short-lived romance with Bachelor alum Sarah Vendal during filming, the real estate agent ultimately found love with Gates, Nick Viall’s Bachelor runner-up.
A source tells Us that the duo is happily dating and have enjoyed romantic weekend getaways together. Another insider shared that the Arkansaw native’s parents met her new beau and the couple plans on going to Dallas soon to meet Gottschalk’s parents.
Although neither Gottschalk nor Gates have confirmed their relationship, they’ve shared romantic photos of their Paradise dates on Instagram.

Liev Schreiber’s kids were in for a major surprise when the 49-year-old actor appeared on Live With Kelly & Ryan on Wednesday, September 6 — he adopted two rescue puppies displaced by Hurricane Harvey!
While backstage at the ABC show, Schreiber was eyeing pets in the green room that were up for adoption after being displaced by Hurricane Harvey. “I had a dust up with one of your producers,” he joked. “I don’t think it’s fair or appropriate that your producers get to take all of the dogs that came from Houston. My sons want a dog and I found a perfect dog but one of your producers already [wants it].”
The camera then cut backstage to an adorable puppy the father of two was interested in. “Think of my poor 10-year-old son, sitting at home right now, looking at the television and weeping for his beloved Hazelnut,” he continued, adding that his sons were tuning in to watch at home.
After the live show wrapped, the actor FaceTimed with Naomi Watts and sons Alexander “Sasha,” 10, and Samuel, 8, to help pick out the perfect pet. After much deliberation, they decided on a pair of pups who are brother and sister. As for the names? “That’s for Naomi and the boys to decide,” Schreiber explained.
Watts and Schreiber were together for 11 years before announcing their separation in September 2016. They share two sons (and now two dogs), but never married.

Are there more red roses in his future? Bachelorette alum Eric Bigger acted coy when asked if he’s still in talks to be the next Bachelor.
“Could I [be the Bachelor]?” Bigger, 29, teased during an appearance on The Morning Breath podcast on Wednesday, September 6, before addressing franchise creator Mike Fleiss’ most recent poll on who the ABC dating series’ next lead will be.
Newest #TheBachelor power rankings:1. Peter2. Wells3. Ben Z4. Eric5. Chase
Fleiss, 53, revealed that the next Bachelor will not be a castoff from JoJo Fletcher’s season, which eliminates fan-favorite Chase McNary from the running. The showrunner later tweeted that Rachel Lindsay’s season 13 runner-up, Peter Kraus, will likely not be the next Bachelor and neither will Bachelor in Paradise heartthrob Wells Adams, which leaves two men remaining on his list — Bigger and Ben Zorn.
“I’m great then,” the motivational speaker noted, before commenting on Kraus’ ability to commit to the franchise’s speedy process. “I don’t really think that [the show wasn’t for him]. If it’s meant for the person to be the Bachelor or whatever that is, I think it’ll happen. I think Peter’s a great guy. He’s a Pisces, shoutout to Peter. I’m a Pisces. He’s very reserved. He’s him.”
The Baltimore native recently spoke to Us Weekly exclusively about the possibility of becoming the next lead. “It’s not up to me actually. It would have to be an in the moment type of answer,” he told Us in August. “I’m open, you’ve got to stay open, cause things happen.”

Will Smith granted the wishes of Aladdin fans when he shared the first photo from the set of the live-action remake of the 1992 Disney hit movie.
The 48-year-actor, who is playing the Genie, posted a cast photo on Facebook on Wednesday, September 6. “We just started shooting Aladdin and I wanted to intro you guys to our new family… Mena Massoud/Aladdin, Naomi Scott/Princess Jasmine, Marwan Kenzari/Jafar, and I’m over here gettin my Genie on. Here we go!” Smith captioned a cast selfie.  
His costar Massoud, who plays the titular role of Aladdin, also shared the same shot on Instagram, writing, “Agrabah just got a lot hotter. Ooof! Gonna be keeping you posted on everything Aladdin peeps ;) #Disney #Aladdin #LiveAction.”
Smith has some big shoes to fill as the Genie was originally voiced by the late Robin Williams in the animated version of the film. Williams, who died at age 63 in 2014, won a Golden Globe for the role, but blocked Disney from using any of his Genie vocals in future versions of Aladdin per his will.
The film is being directed by Guy Ritchie and will feature some new characters, such as love rival to Aladdin, Prince Anders, played by Billy Magnussen, and Nasim Pedrad as Jasmine’s friend and handmaiden Mara. The Aladdin remake will also include two brand new songs, in addition to some of the beloved tunes from the original version.

There was only one man to step up to the, uh, tap.
After Bachelor in Paradise’s unsung hero, bartender Jorge Moren, chose not to return for the soapy spinoff’s fourth season, ABC selected Bachelorette alum Wells Adams to serve up spirits in his place. (Watch the heartthrob explain all in the video above!)
Nestled behind the tiki bar, Adams was always, always there to take the edge off when, say, a girl dubbed you scallop fingers (sorry, Christen Whitney) or, hypothetically, a guy destroyed his role as the Internet’s boyfriend and strung along two girls (looking at you, Dean Unglert).
Pretty large zappatos to fill. You can't replace a legend, you can only try and not screw things up. #bachelorinparadise premiers tonight on ABC 8/7c!
A post shared by Wells Adams (@wellsadams) on Aug 14, 2017 at 4:50pm PDT
And he did so with a specialty cocktail, shared exclusively with Us Weekly. In his go-to concoction: Mint and muddled jalapeños mixed with tequila or vodka “depending on your preference,” he says. After shaking and chilling, he topped the drink off with soda water and a splash of cranberry then garnished with a lime.
“It’s was very refreshing and delicious,” Adams tells Us. “I’m sure it’s like a normal drink and has got some other name, but that was the Wells Special.”
Cheers from behind the bar! #bachelorinparadise
A post shared by Wells Adams (@wellsadams) on Sep 5, 2017 at 6:16pm PDT
And for the extra special Alexis Waters, he crafted a signature shot. Hailed the dolphin-shark in honor of her infamous Bachelor costume, the pour consisted of muddled jalapeños, top shelf tequila and a splash of simple syrup.
“She loved it,” explains Adams, who once vied for JoJo Fletcher’s heart on season 12 The Bachelorette in 2016. “She would have one of those and then she’d be like, ‘Alright, now I’m going to go talk s- -t about Dean and go yell at Jasmine [Goode].’ That’s kind of how it would go every day.”
Bachelor in Paradise airs on ABC Mondays and Tuesdays at 8 p.m. EST.

After Taylor Swift dropped her new single, “Look What You Made Me Do” — which seemingly takes swipes at foes Kim Kardashian, Kanye West and Katy Perry — fans eagerly anticipated the video that would drop two days later at the MTV Video Music Awards on August 27. But when it finally debuted (it’d go on to rack up a record-shattering 43 -million–plus views in 24 hours) Swift was nowhere to be found.
One reason, explains an insider, was her months-long romance with actor Joe Alwyn. Says the Swift insider, who’s attended the popular awards show eight out of the last nine years, “She didn’t want the media to ask about him. She’s enjoying her private time.”
Meet Taylor 2.0. A source says Swift’s new strategy is to “keep her personal life separate from her work life” and leave the PDA behind. Though the 10-time Grammy winner flaunted her brief romance with Tom Hiddleston (see: his “I [heart] T.S.” tank), she’s taken pains to keep her romance with the 26-year-old Brit under wraps. In June, after he visited her in Nashville, Swift sent Alwyn back to London in her private jet. And the couple, who a source says have been holing up in Swift’s $20 million penthouse loft in NYC’s Tribeca neighborhood, relied on hoodies to stay hidden while out in July. 
A Swift source explains that with some of her past releases, “It’s been Taylor’s M.O. to be seen with a new guy first, have her new single drop and then announce her new album. But this time, she’s kept the guy private. And that’s pretty interesting. She really likes Joe.” Still, notes the source, Swift knows she’ll have to officially re-emerge ahead of Reputation’s November release: “Expect to see them step out together really soon.”
After the fallout from the Hiddleswift split, Swift opted to retreat from public life. Now, as she prepares for re-entry, she’s letting her work do the talking. “LWYMMD” was streamed 8 million times on Spotify its first day. And Swift’s fans have praised her ability to poke fun at her persona.
Now she’s ready to pivot to her romance. “Taylor knows the buzz around her just began, and she’ll want to continue that before her album drops,” says the source. “One way is showing off her new love.” He’s a good prize, says the insider, noting the Mary Queen of Scots actor is “supportive of her career choices. She’s very happy.” That may be the best revenge of all.

Sarah Paulson showed off her acting chops during an appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon on Tuesday, September 5, where she played the talk show’s famous Wheel of Impressions game and absolutely nailed her take on actresses Kathleen Turner, Holly Hunter and Drew Barrymore.
After the talk show host, 42, explained the rules of the game, the American Horror Story: Cult star was ready to compete against him. The rules of the game dictate they each have a turn to spin the wheel, which is known as the “impressions generator,” and an actress and a random topic will be selected for them. They then have to do the impressions of the people selected, while talking about the particular subject chosen too.
Paulson, 42, did spot-on impressions of the three actresses while discussing topics such as Slip N’ Slides, gas stations and substitute teachers. Her impression of Turner was spot on, mimicking exactly how the actress’ voice sounds and the way in which she speaks, saying, "Listen, Jimmy, believe me. I know all about Slip N' Slides!"
During her third impression, the actress landed on Barrymore talking about a substitute teacher. Barrymore is known for her unique way of speaking out of the side of her mouth, and Paulson knocked it out of the park.
“Drew Barrymore. Basically, my sister, we love Drew. She’s family!” Fallon said.
The AHS star quickly adopted the 50 First Dates star’s famous voice and said: “I’m so, so, thank you. Thank you, thank you so much. I’m so honored to be in attendance today. Okay, thank you so much. I’m talking about substitute teaching. I’m so, so grateful to be here.”
“Her name is Abby Adamson and oh my Gosh, Abby. I love your name so much!” she concluded.
Fallon nailed his own impressions as well, talking about fidget spinners as Al Pacino and discussing McDonald’s drive-thrus as Zack de la Rocha.
Watch the clip above and tune into new episodes of American Horror Story: Cult on Tuesdays at 10 p.m. ET on FX.

Thirteen years after saying goodbye to North Shore High School, the Plastics are back. Find your burn books and whip up some cheese fries, because Tina Fey announced when her iconic and epically quotable movie Mean Girls is coming to Broadway!
The show, which will open on April 8, 2018, at the August Wilson Theater, is bound to be so fetch. “I tried to remember to stay at the core humanity of it, which is the behavior that comes out of all of us sometimes out of jealousy or fear. The great thing about music is it lets you get in people’s heads and inside their emotional lives in a way that you can do with a tight close-up in movies, but it’s so much bigger and warmer [in a musical],” Fey, 47, who penned the Mean Girls book and is adapting the script for stage, told Entertainment Weekly on Tuesday, September 5. “I think fans will hopefully find that this has the DNA of the movie and is true of the spirit of it, but is also opened up in a lot of ways.”
The 2004 flick Mean Girls’ witty take on high school cliques, teenage culture and bullying captivated audiences and had fans holding out hope for a revival ever since the film premiered. The movie starred Rachel McAdams as queen bee Regina George, and Lindsay Lohan, Amanda Seyfried and Lacey Chabert as her loyal followers. Fey revealed that the Broadway production successfully casted actresses who perform their roles as well as the original cast did.
“It’s similar to the experience I had with the movie, where you watch someone like Rachel McAdams and you think, ‘Oh, she made this. She’s such a great talent that she’s actually making this more than is on the page. When you have great actors, like we do with these young women, they bring more to it than you even imagined,” the 30 Rock alum said of finding the ideal actresses to fill the roles of her beloved characters.
The musical will debut at the National Theatre in Washington, D.C. on October 31 on a trial-run before heading over to Broadway.

Christmas came early for Justin Hartley fans! The hunky This Is Us actor, 40, is totally naked in a new NFSW trailer for A Bad Moms Christmas which was released on Wednesday, September 6.
The comedy, featuring Kristen Bell, Mila Kunis and Kathryn Hahn as moms stressed out by the holidays (and their kids and mothers!), is a sequel to 2016’s Bad Moms. The second movie has a raunchy scene where Hartley gets his butt waxed by Hahn. “How’d you guys meet?” Amy (Kunis) asks Hahn, who plays aesthetician Carla, of her stripper Santa date (Hartley). “Waxing his balls,” she replies.
“I can pull my butt crack open for you if you want,” Hartley offers while spreadeagled with his legs in the air during the waxing scene.
“I don’t think anyone has ever asked if they can hold their butt crack open for me before,” she replies. Hartley quips: “I’ll hold my butt crack open for you anytime you want, Carla.”
The actor previously joked he was offended his This Is Us costar Milo Ventimiglia had all the nude scenes on the NBC show. “I’m a little upset about that … I mean, what does that say?” he said during a March appearance on The Talk. “I just leave that to him. He does the butt work.”
A Bad Moms Christmas hits theaters on November 3.

Getting personal! Reese Witherspoon and Pink stopped by the Ellen DeGeneres Show on Wednesday, September 6, where they played a very revealing game of “Never Have I Ever.”
When DeGeneres, 59, asked the singer, 37, and actress, 41, if they had ever “done it in a public place,” both women admitted that they had. However, Pink was a bit more willing to open up about the experience, later admitting where her intimate act took place. 
Witherspoon was more coy. “What is ‘it’?"she asked, to which DeGeneres retorted: “You know what ‘it’ is.”
Through a laugh, the Oscar winner negotiated: "I will answer as long as there are no follow-up questions.” Seconds later, DeGeneres ignored her request by asking the women where the public place was for both of them. Pink replied, “The park?” while Witherspoon exclaimed: "I said no follow-up questions!"
When DeGeneres asked if either of the women had snooped through their significant other’s phone without them knowing, both ladies flipped over the paddle to admit that they had, though the comedian said she hadn’t. “All the time,” said Pink, who is married to Carey Hart. “I’m pretty sure he knows, though. The code changes a lot.”
The “Just Like Fire” singer recently opened up about her relationship with Hart, 42, and how her life has taken a turn for the positive since welcoming their children, Willow, 6, and Jameson, 8 months. "All of a sudden I’m a soccer mom and doing the damn thing,” Pink told Us Weekly in May. "No one would have guessed this for me. Honestly, I didn’t realize that you could enjoy it so much.”
In May, a source close to the couple — who previously split in 2003 while dating, and again briefly in 2008 while married —told Us that they are stronger than ever. “They’ve been through a lot, but they are solid now,” the insider revealed at the time. “They love their life together.”

Is this the real life, is this just fantasy? Rami Malek looks just like late Queen frontman Freddie Mercury in the first photo from the upcoming biopic Bohemian Rhapsody.
Entertainment Weekly published the first look on Tuesday, September 5,  which would have been the singer's 71st birthday. He died at the age of 45 in November 1991 of bronchial pneumonia resulting from AIDS.
Exclusive: @ItsRamiMalek is #FreddieMercury in this 'Bohemian Rhapsody' first look: https://t.co/xfpQKXgVNZ pic.twitter.com/cplCnggZtW
Bohemian Rhapsody, which is named after Queen's iconic 1975 hit, chronicles the British band from 1970 to 1985. In the first photo, Malek, 36, channels Mercury's look from Queen's performance at the 1985 benefit concert Live Aid.
"When you're able to open your eyes and see a different person staring back at you in the mirror, it's a very affirming moment," the Mr. Robot star told EW of the first time he saw himself in hair and makeup. Resembling the flamboyant musician "only adds to the level of confidence that one would need to play Freddie Mercury," he added.
The movie will feature Malek's own singing voice, recordings of Mercury and a soundalike. "We're going to use Freddie as much as possible and use myself as much as possible," Malek said. "I'm in Abbey Road [Studios] right now if that should say anything to you. I'm not working on my acting."
Bohemian Rhapsody, which is directed by Bryan Singer, hits theaters on December 25, 2018.

Jimmy Fallon and The Tonight Show are helping Hurricane Harvey victims in a big way. The host announced during the Tuesday, September 5, episode that his NBC late-night show is donating $1 million to J.J. Watt’s Hurricane Harvey relief fund.
“Last week we saw the devastating effects of Hurricane Harvey on the state of Texas,” Fallon, 42, said. “But in the face of this tragedy, we saw good. We saw communities banding together. Neighbors helping neighbors. Strangers helping strangers. So many heroes - people like Mattress Mack, who opened up his stores and showrooms for those who needed shelter, the group of people who formed a human chain to save a man from a flooded SUV, and J.J. Watt from the Houston Texans, who has raised over $18 million dollars to provide food, water, and supplies to the victims.”
“And I'm proud to say that our show, The Tonight Show, is donating $1 million dollars to JJ’s fund. Thank you, JJ,” Fallon continued. “One of the most inspiring clips I saw last week was a video of two singers — Victoria White and Marquist Taylor — who visited a storm shelter and formed a spontaneous gospel choir to sing to hurricane evacuees.”
Fallon then introduced White and Taylor, as well as a Houston choir, to sing “Lean On Me.” The choir even changed the lyrics to “Lean on me, Houston” in tribute to the city that was devastated by massive flooding.
The Tonight Show airs weekdays on NBC at 11:35 p.m. ET.

Former NBA player Derek Fisher will partner up with Sharna Burgess, while former paralympic swimmer Victoria Arlen will dance alongside Val Chmerkovskiy. As announced on Tuesday, September 5, former NFL star Terrell Owens will hit the dance floor with Cheryl Burke.
Two of the biggest couplings? Nick Lachey will team up with Peta Murgatroyd while his wife, Vanessa Lachey, is partnered with Murgatroyd's hubby — Maks Chmerkovskiy! Let the battle begin!
Stars in music are ready to make moves as well. Violinist Lindsey Stirling will dance with Mark Ballas in the hopes of getting a perfect 10 from the judges. Singer Jordan Fisher will get in the studio with Lindsay Arnold as Debbie Gibson partners with Alan Bersten.
Also competing for the champion title are Property Brothers’ Drew Scott (with Emma Slater), actor Frankie Muniz (with Witney Carson) and Pretty Little Liars alum Sasha Pieterse (with Gleb Savchenko).

On set romance! Dancing With the Stars’ Carrie Ann Inaba is rooting for the pro dancers who have found love in the ballroom. She revealed her favorite real life DWTS couples in an exclusive interview with Us Weekly.
“There are so many now!” the judge, 49, exclaimed to Us. “I love Maks [Chmerkovskiy] and Peta [Murgatroyd]. I love Sasha [Farber] and Emma [Slater].”
Both pairings have been featured on the ABC series for several seasons. Us broke the news in July that Chmerkovskiy, 37, and Murgatroyd, 31, who are parents of son Shai, 7 months, tied the knot at Huntington, New York’s Oheka Castle. Farber, 33, meanwhile, proposed to Slater, 28, during a live taping of the show in October 2016.
“Watching that proposal when Sasha got down on his knee with Emma was just such a great moment and they’re such great people,” Inaba added to Us. “I’m so happy for everyone on DWTS. Apparently, love is in the air!”
Farber and Slater are slated to appear on DWTS in the upcoming 25th season. The celebrity contestants and their pro partner will officially be announced on Wednesday, September 6.
As for if Sean Spicer will be on the list? “I have no idea. Honestly, and people don’t believe me, but we don’t know who the contestants are before anyone else,” Inaba told Us when asked about the past rumors that the White House press secretary may join the show. “I’m watching Good Morning America right along with the fans – I often live tweet during it. So I have no idea about Sean Spicer, but Melissa McCarthy as Sean Spicer would be hilarious. She’s so funny!” McCarthy, 47, of course, has impersonated Spicer, 45, on Saturday Night Live.
For more, read the rest of her Q&A below:
US: Who has been your favorite contestant?
CAI: This is so hard. I think the best dancer was Normani Kordei from Fifth Harmony. She was partnered with Val last season. My favorite contestant for a different reason was Evander Holifield. He was the first male athlete to be on our show. He’s such a masculine role model and the fact that he came on to a ballroom dance show set the precedent for all male athletes to come on our show. And as you know, athletes have done so well on our show.
US: What incident shocked you the most over the years?
CAI: I think there is a different incident each year that is shocking. That’s the exciting part about DWTS, you think you know who’s got the audience behind them, because they’ve gotten really good scores from the judges. Then we get these crazy, unexpected eliminations. Like last season, when Normani didn’t win, I think it shocked the world. It shocked the judges. We were like, ‘Woah.’
Last season we also lost Heather Morris, which was surprising. But the dynamic on DWTS is that everyone has to not only think you’re a great dancer, the judges have to think you’re a great dancer. But the people at home need to fall in love with you.
US: How long do you see yourself working on DWTS?
CAI: My goal in life is to be the Vanna White of DWTS. I want to be like Vanna. And then, my dream contestant is Manny Pacquio. But I have so many, I also love comedians on our show, too. I think they do really well. We’ve never had a golfer, I’d love to see a golfer.
Season 25 of Dancing With the Stars premieres Monday, September 18, on ABC at 8 p.m. ET.

Couple alert! On the Tuesday, September 5, episode of Bachelor in Paradise, all of the campers had pretty much coupled up. Derek and Taylor, Robby and Amanda, Adam and Raven, Jack and Christen, Daniel and Lacey, Dominique and Diggy, and – last but not least – Dean and Danielle L. Just as things had started to settle down following Kristina’s dramatic departure, Jaimi arrived and promptly reminded Chris Harrison that she was open to dating both men and women.
Ultimately, Jaimi decided to go out with Diggy, much to Dominique’s dismay. “If someone’s checking me out,” Jaimi reasoned, “He’s obviously not that into you.” Sorry, Dominique. “I’m just hoping that I won’t be heartbroken,” she confessed to the camera.
Jaimi and Diggy Make Out
Jaimi and Diggy headed to the local town where everyone heads to for their dates. After Diggy failed to guess her ethnic background correctly, Jaimi explained that to her being bisexual didn’t mean she liked men and women, but that she just “flowed” with whatever or whoever she was feeling. Huh. “We’re coming to the end of this and I could leave Paradise alone,” Dominique later lamented to the camera.
Twinning
Danielle L was still basking in the glow of Kristina’s departure, explaining that it had been hard to move things forward with Dean while Kristina was still around. That’s when Haley and Emily showed up. “We’re just here to f—k s—t up,” they eloquently explained. Chris urged them to not take no for an answer and “give ‘em hell.” Wells called them a “national treasure.”
Amanda promptly filled them in, but neither of the blonde sisters were interested in the two available guys: Jonathan and Jack. They were distraught to hear that both Dean and Derek were basically unavailable.
Dean Turns Down Emily
Since Derek was obviously not going to say yes to a date, Haley settled for “serial killer” Jack. Emily, meanwhile, asked Dean anyway. “Umm, I don’t know,” he said before asking her to read him what the date card said. “You’re going to say no to me?” Emily asked with a giant smile. Dean said he would be doing a “disservice” to both Kristina and Danielle L if he said yes, but noted that Emily was really hot. “I’m not going on a date with anyone else but you,” Emily reiterated. “I just can’t say yes,” he said.
Emily then pulled Danielle L aside to ask her how she would feel if she took Dean on a date. “At the end of the day, it’s his decision,” Danielle L said. “If Dean says yes to Emily, I think D-Lo will go nuts,” Christen said. Emily then looped back to Dean and tried again. He, again, said no.
The Twins Go Psycho
With no other choices, she asked Jonathan to join her on the date – but she really, really wasn’t happy about it. During a camera interview, the twins explained that they’d come for two men, specifically, but “it turns out they’re dating shallow, ugly whores.” Then they (begrudgingly) got ready for their double date.
“We decided we’re going to go on this date with each other and bring these two douchebags with us.” A few minutes before they were supposed to leave, Jack told Haley he decided not to go because he wanted to hang out with Christen instead. “F—k everybody here!” she shouted as both she and her sister stormed off.
Then they started throwing scallops everywhere. “Why would I want to spend time with anyone who acts like that?” Jack asked. His decision seemed to strengthen his bond with Christen. “What I’m really excited about right now is getting to know Christen outside of paradise,” he said, adding that he could see them falling in love and getting married one day.
Taylor and Derek Get Real
“I see you as somebody that I can fall in love with,” Derek said as he snuggled with Taylor on the beach. “And you know, I see glimmers of that and I feel like I’m falling in love with you.” She told the camera that she wanted to “lean into that with him.” Derek then told the camera that he saw her as his life partner and thought they could have a future together. “I’m about to get my happy ending,” she cooed as the sun went down over the ocean. “I can absolutely say that I am in love with her,” he later said.

Time to play detective! Bachelor and Bachelorette executive producer Mike Fleiss has been giving out some major clues about who will be the next Bachelor for the show’s 22nd season.
Fleiss first teased on August 30 that he would soon be announcing some “shocking” news related to the ABC dating show. A few days later, he tweeted that ABC was “very close to being able to finally announce #TheBachelor." Since fans are still awaiting the big announcement, Us Weekly rounded up all his clues and what they could mean.
1. It’s Not Nick.
After Fleiss shared a GIF of Nick Benvenutti getting out of the limo in a Santa costume on night one of JoJo Fletcher’s season 12 of The Bachelorette, fans speculated that St. Nick could be the leading man. However, he quickly clarified, “Nick is NOT the next #TheBachelor."
Then, he also ruled out last season’s Bachelor, Nick Viall, who recently ended his engagement with Vanessa Grimaldi. “I didn’t say WHICH Nick is not the next #Bachelor,” he tweeted. “Neither of them.”
2. It’s Not Whaboom!
The ABC producer assured Bachelor Nation that Lucas “Whaboom” Yancey, who annoyed his fellow contestants on Rachel Lindsay’s season 13 of The Bachelorette with his catchphrase, has not nabbing the coveted role. “We’ve also ruled out Whaboom! Rest easy. #BachelorNation,” Fleiss shared. 
3. It’s Not Fleiss Himself or Chris Harrison.
“I’m very flattered by your tweets, but I cannot be #the bachelor. I’m a happily married man…” Fleiss wrote. “Yes, @chrisbharrison’s name is on the board. It’s a long shot, tho…”
Harrison took himself out of the running, though. “Just heard from @chrisbharrison. Unfortunately, he is no longer a candidate to be #thebachelor…” Fleiss added.
4. He Won’t Be From JoJo’s Season.
“First Big Clue…#TheBachelor will not be from Jojo’s season,” the producer wrote. This officially ruled out fan favorites such as Wells Adams, Chase McNary and Luke Pell.
5. It Won’t Be a Dual Bachelor.
During the Bachelorette season 11, fans were split between Kaitlyn Bristowe and Britt Nilsson as the leading lady, so they both showed up to the mansion on the first night and the men decided who they would like to see as the Bachelorette. Fleiss seemed to hint that won’t be the case this year. “So many solid choices for #thebachelor … But we can only pick one,” he tweeted. “Always a tough call.”
6. It’s Not Dean Unglert.
Unglert stole hearts on Lindsay’s season, but he won’t be getting a turn as Bachelor. “Dean will not be #TheBachelor this year, at least…” Fleiss shared.
Fleiss has also been asking Twitter users to weigh in and submit their picks for the season 22 Bachelor. Some of the names currently topping the list that haven’t been ruled out are Peter Kraus, Eric Bigger, Ben Higgins, Arie Luyendyk Jr. and Ben Zorn.

The bus is once again doing its stuff! Netflix released the trailer for its Magic School Bus revival series, The Magic School Bus Rides Again, which will premiere on Friday, September 29.
In the trailer, Ms. Frizzle (Lily Tomlin, who voiced the character in the original series as well) hands off the keys to the magic bus to her younger sister, the new Ms. Frizzle (Kate McKinnon), who takes over her class. Shortly after, a montage of clips from the new series plays, set to the show’s updated theme song, which is voiced by Lin Manuel Miranda.
The preview shows the Walkerville School group going through a series of adventures reminiscent of the original 1990s series, such as traveling through space and the human body. The new series will have the same educational outings that fans of the beloved show are familiar with. However, it will also take on a modern twist as the crew heads into more timely adventures such as going across the internet.
Miranda tweeted his excitement on Tuesday, September 5, about singing the track for the show. "Hey Lin Magic School Bus is coming back do you want to sing th-YEEEEEEEEEEEEEES,” he wrote. "Also I recorded this in the same studio in London where they record Peppa Pig so."
Watch the fun-filled trailer for the animated series above.
The Magic School Bus Rides Again premieres on Netflix on September 29.

American Horror Story: Cult is inspired by the 2016 presidential reaction and its aftermath, but it is not directly about Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton.
"Our feeling is that everybody lost their s--t after the election — Republican, Democrat — and everybody's still losing their s--t, and nobody's really figured out from either side where to put those feelings," creator Ryan Murphy said at a recent press event, via The Hollywood Reporter.
"There is no real discussion. Everybody's still at each other's throats, you're either on one side or you're on the other," the showrunner, 51, continued. "The season really is not about Trump, it's not about Clinton. It's about somebody who has the wherewithal to put their finger up in the wind and see that that's what's happening and is using that to rise up and form power, and using people's vulnerabilities about how they're afraid and don't know where to turn, and they feel like the world is on fire."
However, main characters Ally Mayfair-Richards (Sarah Paulson) and Kai Anderson (Evan Peters) "have very strong views" about Trump, 71, and Clinton, 69, according to Murphy. In fact, Peters, 30, plays a total of six cult leaders throughout season 7 of the FX anthology, including Charles Manson, David Koresh and Andy Warhol.
Still, Murphy, who was an outspoken Clinton supporter, insists he didn't sneak his own political beliefs into the show. "The world we're living in is ridiculous. So, I think that the show, in some ways, is reflecting the idea that nothing makes sense, and the only way to get through it is to try and have some degree of humor about it," he said.
American Horror Story: Cult premieres on FX on Tuesday, September 5, at 10 p.m. ET.

Hope the jury house is stocked! Matthew Clines was known for three things in the Big Brother household: His showmance with Raven Walton, his cereal obsession and that good ole blue shirt.
The Virginia native, who recently got into a massive argument with fellow houseguest Jason Dent, was often spotted in the kitchen eating his favorite breakfast meal when not competing in competitions.
“Conservatively you would have to think [I ate] 150 but probably more like 250-300 bowls is realistic,” the 33-year-old exclusively tells Us Weekly. “My favorite cereals are Reese’s Puffs, Cap’n Crunch, Lucky Charms, Honey Bunches of Oats, Cinnamon Toast Crunch and [Kellogg’s] Smorz.”
Clines was just as obsessed with Walton, 23, during the game. Although, he didn’t specify if they will put a label on their relationship in the real world.
“Being in the house, it was like having a best friend that is also really really hot and I’m attracted to. As everyone saw, we had so much fun together and never got into a fight. We lined up really well and had such a good time together. The entire game she stayed true to herself. She always had my back and stood up for me,” the renovation consultant tells Us. “In terms of outside of the house, we are definitely going to hang out and have a lot of cool plans. Worst case scenario we’ll be friends forever and best case scenario who knows.”
For more, read the rest of his Q&A below:
US: You and Jason gave each other a big hug before you left. Do you want him to go far in the game?
MC: No, I want to see Jason as soon as possible. Not just from the fact that he evicted me, but if he wants to win the game, I don’t think it was a good move. To keep Kevin [Schlehuber] in the game is maybe one jury vote but he just eliminated two jury votes with me and Raven. I hope to see him next in the jury house.
US: Did you think Zingbot’s joke against Raven went too far?
MC: Zingbot was great! I just didn’t think it was very funny. He had better zings against other people.
US: Why was that blue shirt often your go-to in the house?
MC: I love blue! Those shirts from Walmart are comfortable and it was an easy choice.
Big Brother airs on CBS on Sundays and Wednesdays at 8 p.m. ET and Thursdays at 9 p.m. ET.

Mama drama! Jenelle Evans’ mom, Barbara Evans, kept the reality star's son Jace away from her on Mother’s Day during the Monday, September 4, episode of Teen Mom 2. Kailyn Lowry and ex Javi Marroquin also butted heads once more. Check out the five craziest moments that went down.
Javi and Kailyn on the Rocks
Javi and Kailyn were back to getting along after their recent court drama, but it definitely didn’t last. Javi decided to serve Kailyn a petition for child support so he would be getting some money from his ex in return.
“I’m not going to make her go broke,” he said, but she obviously was not happy.
“He wants to be spiteful and it’s because he wants the money,” she snapped. “Nothing Javi does surprises me anymore.”
Leah Messer Finally Gets Good News
Leah's daughter Ali had to travel to a specialized doctor to get her breathing problems checked out, and Leah was a wreck, but put on a brave face for her daughter.
“I love you and you’re going to do just fine,” she said.
Leah finally got to relax when the doctors told her Ali had no heart or lung complications and they gave her breathing medicine.
“We’ll just take it one day at a time,” she said to her ex Corey Simms.
Jenelle Doesn’t See Jace on Mother’s Day
Jenelle just wanted to spend Mother’s Day with all of her kids, but her mom wasn’t letting her have Jace after their last blowout. "Everyone’s with their mom and not my son,” Jenelle said. “I’m done with everyone’s drama.”
Barbara almost let Jace go, but only if Jenelle's fiancé, David Eason, wasn't around. "David’s here forever so Jace has to get used to it,” Jenelle screamed at her mom. “You’re the grandmother and you need to learn your f--king place."
Chelsea Houska Feels Old
Chelsea got emotional when her daughter finished her last day of first grade. "It won’t hit me until she actually starts,” she said. They celebrated the big day by baking a cake and having a party, and it seemed bittersweet for the mom of two.
Briana DeJesus Pretends to Be With Her Ex Still
Briana was preparing for her baby shower, and there was added pressure because she had to pretend to be together with her ex Luis in front of her extended family. "I just don’t want to disappoint my family again,” she said.
She was annoyed while decorating for the shower because she felt like she was alone and when she voiced her concerns her mom couldn’t take it.
“Everybody’s here to f--king support you. Appreciate that,” her mom said.

There’s been plenty of trouble brewing on Bachelor in Paradise. The Monday, September 4, episode of the reality show opened with Dean caught in a love triangle with Danielle L and Kristina. Robby explained to Dean that both he and Kristina had watched Dean all over Danielle L in the pool the night before. “[Kristina] was bawling her eyes out,” Robby reported to Dean. “It’s all on me for just being a moron,” Dean said to the camera. “And it’s getting me in trouble, left and right.”

Kristina Cries to Dean
Dean talked it out with Kristina. He guessed that she was mad that he was “chicken fighting” with Danielle L. She said chicken fighting was not what she saw. “That was so disrespectful to me,” she said to him. “I do not deserve that.” Dean said that he hadn’t figured out what he wanted just yet. That was pretty obvious to Kristina, but she wasn’t into the idea of waiting around while he came to a decision. “You have no idea how much it stung,” she said through tears. Then she kissed him on the cheek and pretty much took off. Message received. that.” Dean said that he hadn’t figured out what he wanted just yet. That was pretty obvious to Kristina, but she wasn’t into the idea of waiting around while he came to a decision. “You have no idea how much it stung,” she said through tears. Then she kissed him on the cheek and pretty much took off. Message received.
Meanwhile, yearning for a romantic connection, Jasmine hooked up with Jonathan (aka Tickle Monster) in the pool. She insisted it was really great because he tickled her stomach while they kissed.
Blake Arrives With a Date Card – and so Does Fred
Blake arrived feeling like king of the castle because he had a date card. He then started making the rounds complaining about Lucas (aka Whaboom). Danielle L told him point-blank that she would turn him down if he asked her on a date. Kristina spoke to him to be nice, but she didn’t seem very into him. Later, when he asked her to go on a date, she said no.
Next up, Freddy arrived. Within two minutes Dominique agreed to go on a date with him, leaving Blake feeling not so great. Sensing things were getting dire, he asked out Christen, who first demanded to know that he’d already asked Kristina. Despite that awkward moment, Christen agreed. Jack Stone wasn’t so happy about that.
Jack Stone Is a Bad Kisser — Not
Apparently, Jack Stone is a terrible kisser. Dean reasoned that Jack was a 30-year-old man who needed to know if he was really that bad. Jasmine and Raven decided to test him out, but he refused – at least, he refused until after they had some shots. “Jack is a great kisser!” Jasmine declared. That got Danielle L wondering, so she took him for a test drive, too. “Yeah, Jack’s a good kisser,” she confirmed to the camera. Next up was Raven. “Everyone just wanted to kiss him,” Danielle L said. “He had the best day of his life.”
Meanwhile, Christen was not having as much fun on her double date with Blake, Dominique and Fred. After getting seasick and getting a gallon of saltwater in her eyes, she lost her contact in the ocean. “She is miserable,” Dominique said. “But I’m having a really great time on this date!”
Robby and Amanda Take It to the Next Level
Robby landed a date card and promptly asked Amanda to join him. During their date, he told her that he was falling hard in a way that he hadn’t fallen before. “I want to move forward with her as fast as possible,” he said. She seemed smitten as they headed into the rose ceremony (which was happening sooner than expected).
Before the ceremony, however, Ben decided to bow out. He really missed his dog. Somehow this made Diggy more determined than ever to try to make a romantic connection with Dominique.
Scallop Fingers or Bust
Before the rose ceremony, Christen found out that her nickname was Scallop Fingers. Blake didn’t care about her nickname at all. He just wanted her rose. Blake promptly made out with her – but soon after Tickle Monster made his pitch. It also involved kissing.
You were out of my league
A post shared by Dean Michael Unglert 🌹 (@deanie_babies) on Sep 4, 2017 at 8:40pm PDT
Dean Makes His Choice
Meanwhile, Dean assured Danielle L that he was going to officially end things with Kristina because he wanted to pursue a relationship with her. “I know what’s best for me. I know what would make me happiest, is to pursue D-Lo,” he said. Kristina pointed out that Danielle L had been making out with Jack Stone just hours before.
Kristina then went after Danielle L. Raven urged her not to blame Danielle, but Kristina wasn’t having it. Wells then asked Kristina why she was fighting for someone who wasn’t fighting for her.
Rose Ceremony
The ladies were handing out the roses tonight. Lacey was up first and gave her rose to Daniel. Taylor gave hers to Derek – no surprise there. Amanda gave her rose to Robby. Dominique gave her rose to Diggy, much to Fred’s dismay. Jasmine gave her rose to Jonathan. Christen gave her rose to Jack Stone. (Sorry, Blake!) Kristina was next and used her moment to announce that she would not be giving out her rose and was leaving instead. Dean walked her out and they exchanged a hug before she left. Danielle L finished out the night by giving her rose to Dean.

Acting ain't easy! Former Spice Girl Geri Halliwell learned that lesson in a most hilarious way when she ran into Game of Thrones star Kit Harington at the Italian Grand Prix in Monza on Sunday, September 3.
The 45-year-old songstress, formerly known as Ginger Spice, shared an Instagram video of herself with the actor in which he teaches her how to recite one of the HBO drama's most famous lines.
"You know nothing, Jon Snow! You know nothing, Jon Snow," Halliwell intoned several times before the actor corrected her.
"You know nothing, Jon Snow," he recited seriously.
Halliwell tried again and finally earned his approval — sort of. "Yeeaahhh," the 30-year-old actor, who portrays Jon Snow, hesitatingly said before the singer asked for advice on how to nail the five-word line. She finally perfected it and earned praise from Harington: "That's it! You got the part!"
But then she quickly flubbed it once more as the actor laughed at her efforts: "Now you've lost it again!"
The line was uttered multiple times by the King in the North's love, the wildling Ygritte (played by his real-life girlfriend, Rose Leslie), including during her final breaths when she died in season 4 of the hit show based on George R. R. Martin's fantasy novels.
Harington was also spotted at the Italian Grand Prix with Game of Thrones costar Liam Cunningham, who plays Ser Davos Seaworth, on Friday, September 1.

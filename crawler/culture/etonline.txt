Who better to reveal the woman behind Lady Gaga -- removed from the meat dresses and crustacean headdresses and other trappings of her pop star persona -- than a filmmaker who once tried to shine a light on Banksy, the most elusive artist in recent history? In Gaga: Five Foot Two, now streaming on Netflix, documentarian Chris Moukarbel (Banksy Does New York) pulls back the curtain on the Haus of Gaga for a cinema vérité look at the life of Stefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta. ET spoke with Moukarbel, and in addition to discussing how he gained Gaga's trust, what still scares the singer and the postponement of her world tour due to complications of fibromyalgia, he explained how following Lady Gaga was a much different experience than chasing the shadow of Banksy."This was about feeling like you're in the present moment with her," Moukarbel said. “Not only do I avoid using much archival footage or going into her past, but just the style of filmmaking is really about putting you in the present and making you feel like you're on this journey with her."ET: I know that you met with Gaga's manager and then went to her home to film what ended up being the first scene in the movie. Did you have a chance to ever sit down with Gaga, to hash each other out or discuss what each of you wanted out of the documentary?Moukarbel: No. There was no real, formal preparation like that. I think it was discussed casually as we started, but she wasn't really setting out to make a documentary. It was something that was introduced by her manager and I had a concept that he thought was worth exploring with her. She was working on her record and, if anything, she was sort of reluctant because she didn't want cameras or anything to interfere with her writing process or studio sessions. She agreed to participate and felt intuitively that it was a good fit and that she felt safe with me, I think, but it wasn't like she was creatively overseeing this. In fact, it was quite the opposite. She really gave it a lot of space and didn't even really watch the film until the premiere.Do you know what it was about you that made her feel safe?I don't know. When people connect, you never really know what it is, exactly, that you see eye to eye on. I mean, she said that she'd seen some of my work and she really loved it. I just think she goes with her gut. She also knew she had a lot of agency. If for some reason, she was not happy with any of it, she would have ended it. But she let it grow sort of slowly and, by the time there was really a movie there, she had to kind of come to terms with the fact that that's what was happening. But it wasn't until her close friends had seen a cut of the film and told her that they loved it and told her why, it wasn't until then that she was really, like, 100 percent onboard, to be honest. [Laughs]Gaga seems to have been so open with you -- with her health, her friends and family, her creative process. Is there anything you wanted to shoot or that you hoped to have access to but didn't, for whatever reason?I have to say that I really didn't have the opportunity to produce anything. I thought that I would create more of these scenarios that I had wanted to see, but I figured out early on that for me to make this movie meant really going with her flow. I had production crew that, at the beginning, I wanted to bring in -- DPs, sound people -- but it just wouldn't work out like that. Either she didn't want the disruption while she was in the studio or it was too intimate or I was just grabbing my camera and running with her from the car to the plane to her grandmother's house. There was no time or opportunity to bring in any infrastructure, so I ended up shooting a lot of the film myself.What were some of the more produced ideas that you had going into filming?Like, I shot her production of the "Perfect Illusion" music video and it was shot out in the desert. They gave me unfettered access to that set, so I was able to bring a crew in for that, because there was so much production happening anyway. And I was able to shoot it in this big, splashy way that I thought would play in contrast to the more intimate scene in this film. But I did have these fantasies of having much more produced moments with her that I might cut in and out of the movie, where she's sitting in a makeup chair and the camera's right up on her face and then it's a drone shot that slowly pulls out and it's, like, up in the sky and she's a tiny little spec in the desert. More stylized moments. But they never felt right. It was never appropriate. So, you just give in sometimes when you're making documentaries and you realize you can't control the set-up. You're not writing, because it's not a scripted film. So, it's really just urging the universe along in the directions that you hope will lead to what you want to see in the movie.

      In terms of her agency over the content of the documentary, there is a moment early on, after talking about Madonna and what fame has done to various female celebrities, that Gaga turns to the camera and says, "You can't use any of that footage." Do you have to go back, show her the footage and clear that with her?Yeah. When she says it to the camera, she's kind of laughing and sort of means it as a joke. Like, a half-serious joke. She's basically punctuating what she said with, "I can’t believe I just said that on camera." But yes. Because she didn't end up watching the film and we didn't have to negotiate scenes and I didn’t get notes from her, we did show her a few -- what we thought were sensitive -- scenes. Like, that one for example or her doctor’s appointment scene, and just made sure that she understood what was in it and that she felt comfortable with having that in the film.Would she have opinions on how you presented those scenes then? Or would you show it to her and she'd be like, "Yeah, I said it. I did it. Use it."It was exactly like that. I didn't get notes from her, and I always expected that I would. We got to, like, the very bitter end and I was like, Oh my god, one day the other shoe is going to drop and I’m going to get all these notes and I’m going to have to negotiate why I believe in this or that. But it never happened. She really didn't watch the film until it was finished and then, you know, it was what it was. I think people underestimate how open she can be with an artistic project like this. She's always down for an artistic adventure and I think, for her, that's what this was.Especially seeing as how much conversation there has been around the Madonna comment, I wanted to know if you went into filming with a list of topics you wanted to ask her about or if she guided most of those on the fly interviews you have with her?I had very few conversations with her. And if you notice in that scene, that's not me leading that conversation. She's actually just talking to a studio musician that she's sitting outside having a cigarette with. Obviously, it's happening for and in front of my camera, but I didn't ask her any questions about it, and that was sort of my approach to this whole film. That's not to say I never asked her questions. There are times where she looks at the camera and she says something and I have a casual, on the fly conversation with her, and I realized early on that that was just going to happen, because she was not going to pretend like there wasn't a camera there. It's not like there was a fourth wall ever in this movie. It's not reality TV. I'm not pretending like these are just windows into her world. It's pretty honest that there is a camera following her around and she knows that there is a camera following her around and she doesn’t have the energy to pretend like there isn’t. Sometimes she would look at the camera and be like, "What did you think of that?" or whatever. It felt very real in that way.Was it hard to not chime in more in the moments when she was inviting you into the conversation?Yeah, I have to say that's one thing that was a challenge for me when I look back, was trying to keep myself as discreet as possible. [Laughs] Because you’re hanging out with these people in the studio and they’re really cool and they’re really funny and they’re writing music and they’re having all this banter and then sometimes they would pull me in or try to engage me. And, on the one hand, I didn’t want to seem like a creep who’s just, like, spying on them and is not a real human being. So, I would give a little bit of myself, but at the same time, I didn’t want anyone to be focused on me. I didn’t want to get in her head. I didn’t want her to think too much about what I was thinking. So, as much as possible, I really kept my thoughts and opinions to myself and really kept myself as much behind the scenes as possible.

      In the same vein, the movie deals extensively with Gaga's chronic pain. What was it like for you, as a director and just as a human being, having to stay behind the camera and continue recording during those moments? How do you remain detached, maybe, knowing that you can't step in to try to help someone you're seeing in pain?I think that’s exactly it, that you know that there's nothing you can do in that moment. She had people with her that were helping as best they could. It's something she struggles with often, so they do what they can. But it's obviously something that she can't cure herself of and part of why [she did the movie was] she wanted that stuff included. It's some of the only stuff she ever had a creative opinion on was making sure that storyline is in there. Because she's always looking for a positive message in anything she puts out, and she felt like other people who struggle with similar conditions will understand that, if in her place with all of the resources she has, she's still struggling, that obviously they're not alone. Yet, at the same time, she can kind of power through it and get herself up onstage. But it's hard to watch. It was really just, on a visceral level, hard to roll on it. But I knew that she would rather that I filmed it and that was all I could really do.Having been such an intimate audience to that pain, now that the doc is finished, have you been able to reach out to her and check in with her following news that she postponed her tour due to ongoing health issues?Yeah, I do. And, you know, there's nothing harder for her or someone like her than having to postpone shows. This is what she wants to do. It's what she lives and breathes. Obviously, she must have hit a wall in a certain way for her to have to do this at this point.One of the most intimate and moving scenes in the movie is when Gaga plays the song "Joanne" for her grandmother for the first time. [The track pays homage to Gaga's late aunt, Joanne, who died due to lupus at the age of 19.] What was it like to be in the room for that?It was really sweet. I wasn't expecting it. We were driving to the airport, her father was in the car and she just thought it would be a great time to visit her grandmother, because they were together and it was not far from the airport. So, they pulled over and got some flowers and sort of surprised her at her nursing home. And [Gaga] had this song that she had just finished recording, and it's about her aunt, Joanne, the daughter of this grandmother and she wanted to play it for her. It was the first time she played it for her. It was one of the first times her father heard it. It was just a very emotional family moment, because they're still -- to a certain extent -- dealing with this loss. If you think about it, when Gaga was born, it was a fresh family trauma and it was something that was overshadowing a lot of her childhood. So, she was very aware of the loss of this young woman and I think it really shaped her in a lot of ways.Another scene I want to ask about is coming out of the building to the paparazzi and fans screaming. It's just pandemonium. Even with a camera between you, what was it like to experience that?It's indescribable, and that's really why I wanted to include that scene and made it like a hall of mirrors moment, where you start flashing to all of the other times she's walked out into a crowd of paparazzis. Despite however many times she's done it and experiences it, on just a human level, there is a fight-or-flight trigger that goes off in your brain. I think it's really scary for her, having people clawing at her and having people scream at her. At a young age, it was probably more fun, but even then I think it was sort of traumatic. Now, I don't think it ever stops being scary for her.

      How did you land on the title? You use Guy Lombardo's record, "Five Foot Two, Eyes of Blue," in the scene where Gaga's goddaughter is baptized, but what was the process like of choosing it to title the movie?It was tough. I really struggled with figuring out what the title would be, and it was really near the end when I finally landed on that. It's a couple of things. It's her height, obviously. Then, even after I wanted to call it that, I found out there was this song from the '20s. We used the Guy Lombardo recording of it, but there are so many recordings of it. It just felt very serendipitous. But for me, it's like, so much of the film and the story circles around her body. It's about the limitations of her body and the expectations placed on her body. She's an athlete in a lot of ways and has to perform the way an athlete does. Her physical form is really the limitation of how far she can take it, and yet, she's able to be so much bigger than that, so much more than that. So, thinking about her persona and her achievements and her legacy, and then also imagining that this is really, like, a human being that takes up that much space.You mentioned at the beginning of our conversation that Gaga didn't see the movie before the premiere and, at TIFF, she told us that that screening would be her first time watching it. What reaction did she have when she'd finally seen it?It was really sweet afterward. She looked at me in the eyes, she was crying a little. She just thanked me. She knew that it would be emotional for her. She knew what was in the film. I mean, she was there as it was being made. [Laughs] So, she knew what I captured, but I don't think she had any idea of what the overall effect would be, and I think it really moved her. It was just a sweet moment.You followed Gaga for eight months filming this. Do you know how many hours of footage you have in total?I really don't. I mean, definitely hundreds and hundreds of hours, and to distill that into 100 minutes is tough. There's a lot that you lose, but at the same time, I don't feel like there was any real important moment or scene that I wasn't able to include. A lot of times, you're cutting repeats of things. Like, you're getting at the same thing in a lot of different ways and you realize, "OK, I can communicate this or I can capture this through a shorter, more focused scene, rather than all these others ways."There's a lot of studio stuff that I wasn't able to use. I shot a lot -- I would say half of the film was shot during her time in the studio and it only makes up maybe 15-20 percent of the film, if that. So, it starts to become redundant, even though I think it's fascinating and I think other people would find it really interesting, too, watching her work. At some point, you kind of see that side of her life and there are so many other facets of her life that you want to leave the real-estate in the movie to get to that other stuff.There's a great bit in the end credits where Gaga jokes about the "night she gave Beyoncé a panic attack," which I wanted to know everything about. Seeing how you had so much footage and especially because you were working with Netflix, was there ever discussion about turning this into a docu-series?Not for me, at least. I felt really strongly that there was a very focused film here. And, again, not going into her past or going outside of the frame, really just looking at what was going on in her life for that specific period of time. It felt like there was a story to tell. So, I really wanted to keep it within the film format.Having spent all this time with Gaga, what is one way in which she is exactly like everybody else, just any ordinary person? And the opposite of that: what is one way she is, as an internationally beloved pop star, so completely different than the rest of us?I'd say the one thing that makes her, to me, very familiar and very human is just her way of interacting with the people around her after she does something like perform or does an interview. She looks for approval from her family and her friends, and you'd be surprised that she still would, after everything that she's done. But there's something really innocent and sweet about it. Like, she's asking, "How was that? How was I? How did I sound?" That was surprising. I thought it was charming.And then her work ethic is like nothing I've ever seen. She's obviously incredibly creative, she's brilliant, she's super talented in all these different ways, but where I differ from her and what cured me of any fantasy that I could ever become a pop star is when you realize how hard she's working every second of the day and how little personal downtime she's able to have for herself. She's taking in and putting out so much energy all the time and has been for decades. I think that's what kind of separates her out. It's like being a star athlete.EXCLUSIVE: Lady Gaga Talks Involvement in 'Gaga: Five Foot Two': I Can't 'Be Objective About Myself'

Alicia Keys is standing by Chris Blue. The "Blended Family" singer may not be returning for the 13th season of The Voice, kicking off Monday and Tuesday at 8 p.m. ET/PT, but she is keeping last season's winner in the family. Blue tells ET that Keys is currently serving as his manager and lending her expertise to his debut album. "She's had her hand in everything, to be honest," he said in an interview on ET Live. "We're writing together, she's producing, I'm trying to get her on a track -- we'll see what happens. But I won't complain! She's producing, she's writing, I'm good with that." It's been just over three months since Blue took the top prize on The Voice, scoring a recording contract with Republic. Since then, he's been hard at work in the studio and adjusting to life as a newlywed! Blue married his longtime girlfriend, Stephanie Dunkley, in London this summer. EXCLUSIVE: How Chris Blue Is Aiming to Be the First 'The Voice' Superstar"It was incredible," he said of the celebration, but admitted that it didn't all go out without a hitch. "I was an hour late," he confessed. "I decided when I got to London, I wanna drive, so I started driving ... at nighttime, it's a bit harder. I parked in a bus lane and I woke up, and my car was gone. Yeah, they towed the car, man." But Blue couldn't just call a taxi to get him to his wedding... "It wasn't my car, it was her dad's car," he said. "I didn't have a choice. I had to go get the car out or else it wouldn't have gone down." Blue played coy on whether he'll make an appearance on The Voice's upcoming season, in which Blake Shelton, Adam Levine, Miley Cyrus and Jennifer Hudson are serving on the coaches panel, but he did have a prediction for who will take the crown. "I'm gonna go with Miley or Blake -- but my gut is telling me Adam, for some reason," he said. And when it comes to the artists competing each week, Blue's best advice is to stay calm. "Enjoy it, have fun. Don't overthink, don't overanalyze," he said. "Be present, be in the moment. Everything will fall into place. I was a nervous wreck ... This is something that happens once in a lifetime and it's an experience that you'll never forget. Once it's over, it's over and all you have to live with are the memories that you have and the experience that you've shared with the people there." See the full interview below. 


Kelly Clarkson's decision to become a judge on The Voice in 2018 comes down to family.ET sat down with the 35-year-old singer on Thursday, when she explained taking the NBC gig despite getting discovered on rival show American Idol. "Think of how I felt," Clarkson joked to ET's Kevin Frazier about fans' reaction to the surprising choice. "[But] I've been in talks with The Voice about doing stuff for years. It's a family decision too, for us. Like, my husband [Brandon Blackstock] manages Blake [Shelton] so we're all in one place and it's going to be good. And I'm excited, ya'll."Clarkson also said she and American Idol host Ryan Seacrest have no hard feelings towards one another. Kelly Clarkson Says She Lost 'Millions' Because She Didn't Want to Be Associated With Dr. Luke"I had to interview with Ryan Seacrest recently, it was so weird," she shared. "We've never been on, like, opposing networks and so it was funny. We had a good laugh about it."Of course, Clarkson said she'll be cheering on fellow Idol alum Jennifer Hudson's debut as a Voice coach on Monday night's season 13 premiere. "I love her," Clarkson gushed. "I love, first of all, just the confidence that she has, and I had so much fun with her."She also acknowledged her and Hudson's advantages when it comes to judging a singing competition."I think there is a difference being one of the contestants previously on a show like this," she noted. "I think that does carry weight."As for her own Idol win in 2002, she revealed she was actually hoping to get second place -- but not for the reasons one might think!"I don't like to lose, let's be real," she stressed. "The reason why I didn't is because I found out, Justin [Guarini] and I both found out that last week, that whoever won had to do this movie."She's of course referring to 2003's From Justin to Kelly."Ain't no Meryl Streep here, I was like, 'Nope,'" Clarkson recalled, adding that she cried constantly on set. "I hated it.""I obviously tried to put my best foot forward, it's just, like, that's my best foot forward," she continued with a laugh. "This is it."These days, she still has a sense of humor about the film."Even my nanny loves it," she shared. "I'm like, 'If you show my child that, you are fired.'"Clarkson has definitely come a long way since her Idol days and is gearing up for her highly anticipated album, Meaning of Life, out Oct. 27."This album is literally the chapter of my life, that is, I'm blessed, man," Clarkson said. "I love my life and it definitely bleeds through this album."The singer couldn't be more content with her husband and their two kids, 3-year-old daughter River and 1-year-old son Remi."I'm very strict," she says of her parenting style. "You're going to get it done or you're going to go get in trouble. Our nannies too -- we're strict on them making sure they're strict on our kids. I don't want ... they're already super privileged, y'all!"Kelly Clarkson's Adorable Kids Come Visit Their Mom on Set of 'Love So Soft' Music VideoStill, she hilariously admitted to having trouble letting go of River when she recently started school."I'm going to be real with you, you're going to judge me and I'm fine with this, buut I constantly think of Dateline specials, like, something is going to happen to my baby if I'm not there," she shared. "I full on have panic attack dreams up until dropping her off at school.""It was the most gratifying experience to drop your kids off and her be like, 'Bye,'" she later noted. "But at the same time, I want you to need me a little."  For more on how Clarkson's husband has inspired her new music -- specifically, how Blackstock makes her feel sexy -- watch the video below!EXCLUSIVE: Kelly Clarkson on How Her Husband Inspired New Music: 'He Makes Me Feel So Sexy'

Thomas Rhett isn't like a regular dad -- he's a cool dad. The 27-year-old country star and wife Lauren welcomed two baby girls amid a banner year for his career. Rhett's been busy on his headlining Home Team tour since March and just last week became the first country act this year to top the all-genre Billboard 200 chart. "I was really surprised," Rhett tells ET. "I think as an artist, anytime you put a record out, you're just like, 'I hope people like it.' And so when you see your record go No. 1 and stay there for an entire week, that was just a huge feat for me and the team. I'm just so happy for the writers and the people that played on the record because we put a lot of hard work into this record." When it comes to picking favorites, Rhett says that wife Lauren is a fan of "Sweetheart," while 1-year-old Willa Gray gravitates towards the EDM-flavored "Leave Right Now." Rhett also couldn't help but gush over the adorable thing that Willa Gray does when she hears dad's singles on the radio. "Whenever she hears 'Craving You' or 'Unforgettable,' she says 'Daddy! Daddy!' It's the sweetest thing in the world," Rhett beamed. ET caught up with Rhett at his fashion pop-up shop in Los Angeles, featuring collaborations with Daniel Patrick, MadeWorn, New Era caps and his personal stylist, Kemal Harris. While he hasn't yet ventured into baby and toddler fashion -- "We should have made a onesie!" he laughed -- he did open up about how much fun he's had teaching his eldest daughter about fashion and how he's balancing parenthood with a demanding career. See the full interview on Friday, Sept. 29, on ET's "Certified Country," which runs every Friday on ET's YouTube and Facebook pages. In the meantime, you can check out all the latest episodes -- including, most recently, a hilarious game of emojis with Dustin Lynch -- here.

No charges will be filed against Audrina Patridge's estranged husband, Corey Bohan, after the former Hills star filed a domestic abuse case against him, ET has learned.Patridge called the Irvine Police Department on Sept. 6 after she stated in court papers that Bohan had been harassing her. After the investigation, the evidence was presented to the Orange County District Attorney’s office which, after review, rejected the case.“The prosecutor reviewed all of the information provided by the Irvine Police Department and, unfortunately, the prosecutor did not feel that they would be able to prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt," a spokesperson for the Orange County District Attorney’s office told ET on Monday.Patridge's rep tells ET in a statement, "Audrina is putting on a brave face, but these exchanges between Audrina and Corey are court ordered to take place at a police station for her protection. There is still a family law domestic violence case open."Corey Bohan Responds to Audrina Patridge's Restraining Order as She Requests He Be Forced Out of Their HomePatridge and Bohan tied the knot last November after dating on and off since 2008, and share 1-year-old daughter, Kirra. Patridge filed for divorce on Wednesday, citing irreconcilable differences, and listed her and Bohan's date of separation as Sept. 6. According to court documents obtained by ET, two days prior to filing for divorce, Patridge requested a temporary restraining order against the Australian BMX rider for an alleged domestic violence incident. A judge in Orange County, California, granted Patridge's request, ordering Bohan to stay 100 yards away from her. Bohan was granted monitored visitation of Kirra, and their next hearing is set for Oct. 6."Audrina’s No. 1 priority is her daughter and she asks for privacy at this time," Patridge's rep told ET at the time. On Saturday, the 32-year-old reality star broke her silence about the divorce drama, posting a video of Kirra on Instagram."Light of my life. This little beauty lights up the room wherever she is!" she wrote. "I appreciate all your thoughts & messages, this is a difficult time but we are doing ok xoxo."Audrina Patridge 'Leaning on Support of Her Family' Following Divorce FilingWatch the video below for more on Patridge and Bohan's split.Audrina Patridge Files For Divorce From Corey Bohan After Less Than One Year of Marriage

      A Little Work by Fergie on VEVO.The track is the first single from Fergie’s new album, Double Dutchess,  and the 11-minute video is interspersed with clips of the singer sharing intimate details about experiencing feelings of fear, panic and being watched. It is unclear whether the statements are based on her own life, however, she has previously spoken about battling drug addiction before joining the Black Eyed Peas.“I got to a point where I was seeing devils everywhere.

Staying 100 percent healthy is already proving to be a challenge for this season's Dancing With the Stars contestants.During only the second week of official competition, both Drew Scott and Vanessa Lachey suffered painful dancing injuries during rehearsals, and both moments were caught on camera.

Here at ET, we’re obsessed with a lot of things – and this is what we’re most excited about this week:Why We’re Obsessed With Judi Dench For the second time in 20 years, Dame Judi Dench is tasked with portraying Queen Victoria—this time in Stephen Frears’ Victoria and Abdul, an unofficial sequel to her Oscar-nominated turn in Mrs. Brown, about the friendship between an Indian Muslim functionary and the monarch of England. Her portrayal is earning her rave reviews, which will certainly mean more of Dench during awards season as she promotes the Oscar-bait film and the upcoming star-studded mystery, Murder on the Orient Express, which is in theaters on Nov. 10.

But his big breakthrough moment comes as the star of the Big Bang Theory spinoff, Young Sheldon, taking over the titular role as the 9-year-old version of Sheldon Cooper. And Armitage comes fully approved by Jim Parsons, who says the actor’s audition tape was “mind-blowing.” “There was a natural-ness with it and a spirit with it, and an understanding of [the charater],” he told ET.Young Sheldon premieres Sept. 25 at 8:30 p.m. ET on CBS.MORE: Meet the 9 Breakout TV Stars You Need to Know!Why We’re Obsessed With ‘This Is Us’  The hit drama, starring Sterling K.

The continuation, which has already been renewed for a second season, sees the return of Will (Eric McCormack), Grace (Debra Messing), Jack (Sean Hayes) and Karen (Megan Mullally), as the gang picks up where things left off—well, sort of. The show will ignore the debated series finale and focus on a reset timeline that now includes Donald Trump in the White House, a feminist Grace and more sexualized gay characters. “We're back to the four of us, which is really where it all began and where the magic sort of lives,” Messing recently told ET.

Hosted by Shan Boodram, the show uses the “wisdom of the crowd,” with viewers weighing in to determine if couples should stick it out or let it go. And so far, in the show’s first three episodes (of its six-episode run), two of the couples have been advised to break up. Maybe the audience is scorned by love or all those engagement photos on their feed, or maybe those couples just weren’t right for each other. Either way, it’s not the craziest dating show we’ve seen.Make Up or Break Up streams live Thursdays on Facebook Watch.--Additional writing by Rachel Maresca Related Gallery'This Is Us': Adorable Behind-the-Scenes Pics From Season 2

Normally it's a good thing when you get a star like Reggie Watts to serenade you with a song -- but maybe not this time!
On Wednesday's episode of Baroness von Sketch Show, the musical comedian makes a guest appearance in a very funny sketch centered around a woman's 44th birthday.
Three office pals -- played by Baroness' Meredith MacNeill, Aurora Browne and Carolyn Taylor -- hire Watts to make up a song for their co-worker Ashley's (Jennifer Whalen) big day, but the overly specific, meandering tune gets a little too spot-on for her liking. After all, loneliness and IVF aren't two topics you expect to hear in a celebratory song.

Stone plays world No. 1 tennis player Billie Jean King, a feminist who fought for gender equality in the sport in the '70s, while Carell plays Bobby Riggs, the media-hungry, self-proclaimed male chauvinistic pig who challenges her to the titular match.

      Happy Death DayWho: Jessica Rothe, Israel Broussard, Ruby ModineWhat: 2017 has provided plenty of scares, courtesy of Pennywise the Dancing Clown in It, demonic xenomorphs in Alien: Covenant and racism in Get Out.

      WonderstruckWho: Julianne Moore, Michelle Williams, Millicent Simmonds, Oakes FegleyWhat: Academy Award winner Todd Haynes reunites with his Far From Heaven star, Moore, for a film that appears as wondrous as the title suggests.

      All I See Is YouWho: Blake Lively, Jason Clarke, Danny HustonWhat: How does one follow up a cinematic masterpiece like The Shallows, last summer's Criterion-worthy hit in which Lively literally fights a shark? By playing a blind woman who regains her sight, it appears. If that sounds like the plot of a heartwarming YouTube video, though, be warned that this is from the same director who did World War Z and Machine Gun Preacher.When: Oct. 27

      SuburbiconWho: Matt Damon, Julianne Moore, Oscar IsaacWhat: There's a Coen Brothers movie buried somewhere within Suburbicon, a satire of the '50s that combines a vintage script by Joel and Ethan with additional plotting by director George Clooney and Grant Heslov.

      Wonder WheelWho: Kate Winslet, Justin Timberlake, James Belushi, Juno TempleWhat: There are plenty of reasons not to see the new Woody Allen movie -- the obvious, sure, but also the fact that most of his recent work (Magic in the Moonlight, Café Society) has been critically meh-ed. If you so choose, what’s known about his latest is that it's set on Coney Island in the '50s.When: Dec. 1

      FerdinandWho: John Cena, Kate McKinnon, Bobby Cannavale, Gina Rodriguez, Anthony AndersonWhat: The title, in conjunction with the awards season release date, may have the highfalutin whiff of prestige Oscar bait -- perhaps some saga of love and heartache in the Spanish countryside -- but this is about the bull, Ferdinand (voiced by former wrestler Cena), and his big heart.When: Dec. 15

Nearly two years after Downton Abbey went off the air, most of the beloved ensemble cast is back in action on screen and stage, with Michelle Dockery, Dan Stevens and Joanne Froggatt leading several high-profile projects coming out this fall. 2017 Fall Preview: ET's Complete CoverageEven though the period drama ended in 2015, this year can definitely be dubbed “2017: Life After Abbey.” And to think, all we care about is a Downton Abbey movie!Check out what’s coming up (and highlights of a few things you may have missed): Michelle DockeryGood Behavior (TNT)

      Dockery, aka Lady Mary, was one of the first cast members out of the gates with a decidedly un-Downton-like character, playing con artist and recovering drug addict Letty Raines on TNT’s Good Behavior. “I was very fortunate when it came along,” Dockery told ET. “I wasn’t consciously looking for something so vastly different.” The show proved to be a hit and returns with a second season in October.It’s the first of two series starring Dockery coming out this fall. The other is Steven Soderbergh’s seven-part limited series about notorious criminal Frank Griffin (Jeff Daniels) hunting down Roy Goode (Jack O’Connell), who takes refuge in the home of widow and outcast Alice Fletcher (Dockery).Elizabeth McGovernTime and the Conways (Broadway)
Opens 10/10; in previews nowIn a grand return to the stage, McGovern and Pitch Perfect’s Anna Camp take on a revival of J.B. Priestley’s play about the decline of a wealthy British family in the mid-1900s.

      Perhaps the busiest Downton alum, Stevens has made Matthew Crawley a thing of the past. He kicked things off with the titular role on FX’s Legion, which has been renewed for a second season, and the live adaptation of Disney’s Beauty and the Beast. Those hits were then followed by back-to-back releases of Colossal, Kill Switch, Norman: The Moderate Rise and Tragic Fall of a New York Fixer, The Ticket and the Tribeca Film Festival premiere of Permission. Stevens closes out the year with two biopics, about the lives of Thurgood Marshall -- he plays Lorin Willis, not the Supreme Court justice -- and Charles Dickens. “I've felt like I've grown so much as an actor,” Stevens told ET of the opportunity to showcase a transformation from lord and lover to a multifaceted character actor. “To be given the opportunity to play in all these different spaces and to see where some of them might lead -- and I'm not going to claim that all of them are going to be successful avenues -- but I enjoy exploring them all.”Hugh BonnevilleViceroy's House (Theaters and On Demand)

On the period drama, which premiered in April, the actress plays Charlotte Wells, a high-end prostitute who followed her mother into the brothel business. “I just adored reading a character that you sort of love but also feel really frustrated by and makes bad life decisions sometimes,” she told ET of her character, who certainly has a mind of her own. Michael Fox Dunkirk (Theaters)

Audrina Patridge is speaking out after filing for divorce from husband Corey Bohan.The 32-year-old former Hills star shared a video of their 1-year-old daughter, Kirra, on Instagram on Saturday, and thanked fans for their support."Light of my life ✨ This little beauty lights up the room wherever she is!," she wrote. "I appreciate all your thoughts & messages, this is a difficult time but we are doing ok 💕xoxo (Kirra loves this little dress my grandma made it for my aunt 50+ years ago and it's still in perfect condition & cute as ever)."
 Audrina Patridge Claims Corey Bohan Was Verbally Abusive in Restraining Order FilingThe reality star filed for divorce last week after obtaining a temporary restraining order against husband Corey Bohan following an alleged domestic violence incident. The Australian BMX rider was granted monitored visitation with Kirra.
 
In court documents obtained by ET, Patridge claims that her husband of less than a year had "become increasingly possessive, angry, agitated and jealous" of her hectic work schedule and travel obligations.
 
"His aggressive behavior usually escalates whenever I am paying attention to work obligations, rather than to him," she alleges in her restraining order petition, citing that the couple officially separated on Sept. 6 due to "irreconcilable differences."
 
Patridge, who has since been living at her parents' house, adds, "I am fearful of [Bohan's] temper because he cannot control his swearing and personal attacks on me, even when in the presence of our young daughter."
 
The reality star also alleges that Bohan is "holding all of my personal possessions and my home hostage," saying that he cursed at her and installed cameras in their home, violating the temporary restraining order she has against him.
 Corey Bohan Responds to Audrina Patridge's Restraining Order FilingMeanwhile, Bohan claims Patridge and her family showed up at the property on Wednesday "literally barging in the house through the garage door" with 15 minutes notice, when he requested they avoid conflict by setting up a time when he would not be there.
 
The professional dirt bike rider denied cursing and installing additional cameras in the house, and accuses Patridge of "hijacking" his visitation with their daughter by calling Child Protective Service with "bogus allegations" against him.

Jessie James Decker is so happy to be back "home" in Nashville, Tennessee.
ET spoke with the country star while she was promoting season three of Eric & Jessie, where she revealed just how excited she was when her football star husband, Eric Decker, told her he had signed a one-year contract with the Tennessee Titans after being released by the New York Jets.
"I honestly never thought that could happen," Jessie, who's been in Nashville on-and-off for 10 years to work on her country music, explained. "That seemed so in the distance, way too good to be true. I remember saying to Eric, 'Well, maybe whenever you're ready to retire, you just got one year left in you, maybe you can just tell your agent to just give 'em [the Titans] a call.' I would be funny with it."
"So, when it actually did happen, I was like, 'What? This is real life? We get to just stay home?'" she recalled. "It was just really exciting. Obviously it was a little sad to leave New Jersey and the New York Jets community. They were really, really good to us and I'll always be grateful for that, but there's nothing like coming home."MORE: Jessie James Decker Says New Season of 'Eric & Jessie' Is 'Funny, Sweet and Loving'Although Jessie and Eric are ecstatic to finally be in one place together full-time with their two children, daughter Vivi, 3, and son Buby, 2, the brunette beauty tells ET that they still have a lot of work to do, as they're currently renovating their house.
"We are far from being settled in," she joked. "Even though we've had this house for almost a year now, it wasn't 100% what I wanted as far as the aesthetics go. But now that I know we're staying here, I can put my whole heart and soul into making this house look the way I want."
"The kids are just happy to be in Nashville full-time," she added. "Vivi knows that Nashville is her home."With two adorable kiddos and a home to officially call their own, Jessie says she and Eric are now "completely open to having another baby."
"I wasn't ready before," she admitted. "Because I had just had Vivi and Bub back to back, they are, like, 17 and a half months apart. Two little ones running around in diapers and bottles, you need a break."
"But now that little man is two, I'm completely open, and whatever happens, happens," she revealed. "I'm game. Let's do it."So, how does she think Vivi and Buby (real name: Eric Decker II) would react to news of another Decker baby?
"I think they would be SO happy," Jessie gushed. "Vivi keeps asking me for another sibling. She says she wants a little sister.""No nicknames yet," Jessie added, joking about how it was Vivi who came up with their son's nickname. "But she definitely keeps saying, 'I want a little sister.'"As for her marriage with Eric, Jessie says their relationship is still going strong. While chatting with ET, she recalled the moment she knew Eric was "the one" -- and gave some stellar advice for all the single ladies out there about not settling for just anybody!
"Whenever we spent some time apart from each other, I truly felt like I couldn't live without him," she said. "I would just think to myself, 'I cannot live without this man. I cannot go another day without him in my life.' He was just such a kind, warm person. I believe in soulmates and I just knew that we were meant to be together."
"For single girls, I would just say, listen to those red flags," she advised. "If you get that pit in your stomach about a guy, that he's done something that just doesn't feel right, then you have to listen to that. And it's probably not worth being in that relationship."
Jessie said she "never felt that way" with Eric.
"I never felt judged, I never felt like there were ulterior motives. I just felt like it was just pure love for me," she explained. "I'd also say, always be confident. Men are so attracted to confident women, and that goes a long way. I had a lot of confidence when I met Eric. I was finally in a good place with myself and I feel like he was very attracted to that. I knew who I was."MORE: Jessie James Decker and Kristin Cavallari's Kids are Ready for FootballWell said, Jessie!Eric & Jessie airs Wednesdays at 10 p.m. ET/PT on E!EXCLUSIVE: Jessie James Decker Fires Back at Breastfeeding Backlash: 'It's Just a Boob, Calm Down!'

A bespoke British spy with a license to kill. His techy right-hand man, known only by his code name. All the amusingly absurd gizmos and gadgets. A beautiful femme with an inclination toward evil. It sounds familiar, yet there's been so much ado about whether there will be another James Bond movie -- and if Daniel Craig will be back for it -- that people seem to have forgotten there's another agent who ticks all those boxes and does have a movie out now: Eggsy (Taron Egerton).If you didn't see Eggsy make his chav-to-suave(ish) transformation in The Secret Service, you are going to be awfully confused when the sequel, Kingsman: The Golden Circle, kicks off with not so much a bang, but at least at gunpoint. Charlie (Edward Holcroft), rejected by the Kingsman in the first film, holds Eggsy up, which escalates to gunshots and then an intricately choreographed fight in the backseat of a town car -- dizzyingly soundtracked to pop music -- which escalates into a car chase and ends with a rocket launcher. And then Eggsy's car turns into a Despicable Me-like submarine. That all takes place within the first 30 seconds of the movie, and it's exciting and outlandish and goofy in a way that the Bond movies aren't anymore. (Which is not a bad thing, necessarily. Since Casino Royale, they’re just something else now.)EXCLUSIVE: Behind the Scenes of 'Kingsman: The Golden Circle' With Channing Tatum & Halle BerryAs far as Egerton’s Eggsy goes, he’s always skewed toward adorable over 007’s stoicism, like a boy trying on the Bond persona and finding it not quite a perfect fit, but fun as hell nonetheless. An unlikely recruit to the Kingsman, an Arthurian agency of spies, he has always shown a vulnerability and defensive humor that isn’t required of a graduate of the hoity-toity royal navy. The Golden Circle differentiates them even further by revealing that Eggsy is now in a monogamous relationship with Swedish Princess Tilde (Hanna Alström). Though perhaps a reactionary move to her being the butt (ahem) of the joke in the first movie -- and not that monogamy is right for everyone -- it is refreshing to see a spy who respects women, who values his commitments to the women in his life. I wondered, is this millennial Bond finally getting Bond right?(To be fair, Bond was married once, to Tracy Bond. Here’s hoping Tilde fairs better.)Eggsy may be improved -- at one point in The Golden Circle, he gets emotional and cries! How often are male secret agents allowed to do that? -- the movie quickly gets in its own way. As directed by Matthew Vaughn, the plot hinges on the decimation of the entire Kingsman family, including killing off fellow spy, Roxy (Sophie Cookson). It is meant to add stakes to the film, but it denies the opportunity to show a spy having a truly platonic relationship with another spy of the other sex, an esteemed female agent who is also Eggsy’s best friend.At the very least, considering Cookson’s Roxy was a fan favorite in the first film, it would have been nice to see her do more than help Eggsy fake his way through a date using a secret earpiece, that tired gag.The same goes for Halle Berry’s newly introduced agent (...sort of) Ginger Ale. With the Kingsman down, Eggsy and his Q counterpart, Merlin (Mark Strong), hop the pond to seek assistance from their American cousins, the Statesman: Agents “Champ,” as in Champaign (Jeff Bridges), Whiskey (Narcos' Pedro Pascal) and Tequila (Channing Tatum), the latter arriving with his shotgun twirling and a “y’all”-heavy Kentucky accent, then essentially disappears for the rest of the movie. (At one point, he gets cryogenically frozen! Tatum probably spent more time on the photo shoot for the movie’s billboards and posters than he did filming the actual movie.) Berry is equally underserved, but it feels more egregious because she’s there! Stuck behind a monitor. Berry’s Bond Girl -- NSA agent “Jinx” in 2002’s Die Another Day -- eventually got to see some action, so why is she being relegated to a staring-at-a-computer-screen role here?

      Thankfully, Julianne Moore’s villainous Poppy Adams is one of the best movie villains I’ve seen onscreen in a bit. There’s the plotting of it all: As head of the titular Golden Circle, a cartel with a global monopoly on the drug trade, she has a clear motive -- not to take over the world, but to get fame, fortune and, for once, some gosh darn respect. More so, it’s what Moore does with this part, the chipper way she threatens someone without raising her voice or how she watches a henchman being put head-first into a meat grinder with a placid grin. Poppy is a sadistic Martha Stewart-meets-Griselda Blanco and Moore is having a ball with it.So, it’s one step forward, two steps back perhaps. Or two steps forward, one close-up shot of a vagina back, as the case may be. That will surely be the most problematic scene in the movie: In an all-around unnecessary sequence that hops back across the pond to Glastonbury, Eggsy’s assignment is to seduce an enemy’s girlfriend (Poppy Delevingne) and place a tracker on her. Or, inside her -- the gag is that the bit ends with a shot tightly framed on her panties, then continues on into her body via CGI. It's Vaughn doubling down on the running anal sex joke that was so widely criticized in The Secret Service.So, yeah, that’s gross. And unnecessary. But I do find the scene interesting to look at, for the moments pre-seduction when Eggsy slips away to the bathroom to Facetime Tilde and ask for her permission to, as she angrily puts it, “screw the target.” She’s (understandably) not pleased, but the fact that Eggsy is not the secret agent-type who unthinkingly screws any woman that crosses his path, that Delevingne’s character is sexually in charge and Eggsy is morally hesitant (and doesn’t ultimately have sex with her! He’s kind of a good dude!) has to be some slow version of progress, doesn’t it? Eggsy appears to be on the right track. Now, I suppose, Vaughn just needs to catch up to him. That bodes well for the third film, right?As far as I’ve deciphered, the point of Bond movies -- and all of the spy franchises they begat, including Kingsman -- is that they're supposed to be fun, supposed to revel in how being an international man of mystery is just so cool. On that front, I’d say Kingsman: The Golden Circle succeeds. After all, Egerton is endlessly charming, and I’d take Eggsy over Bond any day. I haven't yet mentioned the return of Colin Firth's Harry Hart, whose return from the dead is explained away fairly sillily and easily, but there is one scene involving a puppy that gave me chills. Or the ace use of a very game Elton John. Or the rest of the action sequences that smash through the blood-brain barrier, chaotic and cartoonishly bloody. (And if a movie is going to be extremely violent, at least this one is creative about it?) Or the dutiful subscription to the principle of Chekhov’s gun: If in the first act you have robotic guard dogs named Bennie and Jet, then in the following act, they should attack someone. (They do.)Taron Egerton on 'Kingsman' Fight Scene With Channing Tatum: 'I'd Take [Him] Any Day'

Tamar Braxton is serious about retiring from music.“There are a lot of things that I want to do, and a lot of things that are in the works,” she tells ET. “There's a lot of things that are going on in my relationship and me being close to this music industry, and whatever I can do to eliminate all of the stress and problems off of my relationship, I would rather do that.”“My husband [music executive Vince Herbert] and I work very close together and it's really hard, you know?” Tamar continues. “Not only do we work together, he is my baby daddy and, you know, we've been together forever. He's my best friend. It's a lot of things to discuss and argue about.”Tamar says her new album, Bluebird of Happiness, out Sept. 29, will be her last record ever, though she still plans to write songs for other artists.EXCLUSIVE: Tamar Braxton on 'Aftermath' of Parent's Divorce & Lessons She's Learned From Her Marriage“I am nerv-cited,” she says of the release. “I'm nervous and excited at the same time. This has just been a project that's been so close to me, and I've worked really hard on it and it was kind of, like, the soundtrack to my life at the time.”The record, which Tamar describes as “transparent, real and unapologetic,” is the star’s diary of the last year or so, featuring her responses to infidelity rumors and family drama. That includes her father’s marriage to a woman Tamar alleges he cheated on her mom with since Tamar was 11 years old.“It's really about showing who you are and not being afraid to talk about experiences you have gone through,” Tamar shares. “It's just about, you know, stripping down and being real.”“This album is just where I was in my life at the time,” she adds. “You know, nothing in my life felt right. And everything felt like it was a question mark that surrounded it and, you know, I just had to write and sing about it.”EXCLUSIVE: Tamar Braxton Breaks Down Crying During Intense Family Dinner on 'Braxton Family Values'The title comes from an old folktale about a bluebird who wakes up one day itching for a new life. The bird travels the globe looking for something better, only to find itself back at home -- and happy. Tamar says that’s exactly the journey she went on before writing this record.“It's OK to not know who you are!” she admits. “It's OK to go and figure it out, because I think, once you figure it out, you evolve. And that's what life is all about, is evolving.”Some songs on the record might give fans a window into Tamar and Vince’s marriage, and Tamar says she -- and Vince -- are good with that.“He calls it my best work yet,” she gushes. “I'm just excited that everybody's finally hearing it.”But again, this will be the last time she opens up about home life in such an intimate way. She’s ready to turn her focus to her family, noting that her marriage is the part of her life she sometimes let’s fall by the wayside..“This is just my job,” she says of singing. “When I go home, that's my home. I always want to keep my home a sanctuary and somewhere safe. Not just for me, but for my husband and my kid.”EXCLUSIVE: Tamar Braxton's Husband Vince Herbert Shuts Down Divorce RumorTamar and Vince’s only son, Logan, recently turned four years old -- and watching him grow up has changed the reality star’s idea about not having more kids.“I'm so mad at myself, because I wanted the Partridge Family and I didn't know it until, you know, Logan got to be a certain age,” she admits. “I'm like, what? Yeah, I really want more kids. I would love to have at least five.”Tamar, 40, adds that she doesn’t know “where they’re going to come from” -- she’s experienced infertility issues in the past -- but still thinks about expanding her family a lot. She says she might try to have more kids once she wraps up her Bluebird of Happiness era, which includes performing on XScape’s reunion tour.“Everybody knows a Tamartian tour is the best place to be in life,” she notes. “Get your life, honey!”After the tour, there’s also a possible return to daytime TV for Tamar. She exited The Real after two seasons back in spring 2016 -- and tells ET she’s eyeing a comeback.“I miss it,” she spills. “I can't wait to get back. That's what I'm gonna say.”Bluebird of Happiness is available for pre-order now with a couple of instant track downloads, including Tamar’s new single, “Blind," and Tamar and Vince returns for a new season on We tv this fall.

Sept. 22The Killers return with their fifth studio album, their first since 2012’s Battle Born, featuring the singles “The Man” and “Run for Cover.” “I wouldn't feel this excited if the songs weren't true,” lead singer Brandon Flowers told Billboard this summer. “We’ve been hearing a lot of false music out there -- music designed for the nondiscerning listener. It’s always good when you have that satiated feeling, the desire that’s quenched, when you have substance behind it. That’s when you know you have something.” Macklemore: Gemini
Sept. 22Don’t expect to find any “Thrift Shop” reboots on Macklemore’s latest album -- it’s his first offering in more than a decade without collaborator Ryan Lewis on-board. Still, Gemini is certainly not short in the collab department, featuring vocals from Kesha, Lil Yachty and Skylar Grey, to name a few. Fergie: Double Dutchess
Sept. 22It's been more than a decade but The Dutchess is BACK with her long-awaited sophomore solo effort, Double Dutchess. Fergie will release the 13-track visual album via her own label, Dutchess Music, featuring collaborations with Rick Ross, Nicki Minaj, YG and, adorably, 4-year-old son Axl Jack (on the song "Enchante (Carine)").EXCLUSIVE: Fergie Talks Split From Josh Duhamel: 'We're Just Not a Romantic Couple Anymore'Chris Janson: Everybody
Sept. 22“It’s no pun intended, but literally I wrote it for everybody,” Janson told ET of his sophomore effort, for which he wrote or co-wrote every track. “I thought it was the perfect title because there is something on here from every walk of life and there’s something for everybody. Maybe you don’t really like traditional country music. That’s cool, we’ve got other things on there. Maybe you do, and that’s great too because we’ve got the best of both worlds and everything in between.”“I feel like people are really getting a piece of my heart and really what I wanted to say,” he continued. “I’ve never tried to change the world, I always just want to put a smile on somebody’s face and that’s exactly what I think we did with this album.” 2017 Fall TV Preview: Love It, Date It or Leave It?Miley Cyrus: Younger Now
Sept. 29Cyrus is getting back to basics with her Bangerz and Dead Petz follow-up, Younger Now. The 24-year-old showcased a more stripped-down sound on its lead single, “Malibu,” written for beau Liam Hemsworth, doubling down on promises to return to her country roots with the twangy “Inspired” and by channeling godmother Dolly Parton in her “Younger Now” music video. Shania Twain: Now
Sept. 29"I wrote all of this music myself, so it's all on me. If fans don't like it, I just have to take that on myself, but it's worth it, because even if a small amount of people are inspired by it, I've done what I set out to do," Twain told ET earlier this year. In her first new album since 2002, Twain is putting it all out there, working through everything from the end of her 16-year marriage, temporarily losing her voice to Lyme disease, to the start of a new marriage to Frederic Thiebaud. It seems to be perfectly encapsulated in Now’slead single, “Life’s About to Get Good,” which was released earlier this summer.Dolly Parton, I Believe in You
Sept. 29The country queen is channeling her inner fairy on her first children’s album 50 years after her debut was released. I Believe in You will include a new version of “Coat of Many Colors,” along with songs like “Responsibility,” “Brave Little Soldier” and “I Am a Rainbow.” (Yes, Dolly, you certainly are.) Demi Lovato: Tell Me You Love Me
Sept. 29Lovato’s sixth studio album builds on her song of summer Platinum smash, “Sorry Not Sorry,” showing off her jaw-dropping vocal range with the powerful sobriety anthem, “You Don’t Do It for Me Anymore,” and delivering soulful swoon on the title track, “Tell Me You Love Me.” The album features collaborations with a lengthy list of songwriters and producers, including Oak, Sean Douglas and John Hill, Stint and DJ Mustard, among others.Gwen Stefani: You Make It Feel Like Christmas
Oct. 6Is October too soon to get in the Christmas spirit? Stefani is getting a jump on the holiday season with You Make It Feel Like Christmas, which features beau Blake Shelton’s vocals on the title track. Gwen Stefani and Blake Shelton Relationship Update -- What the Future Holds for 'The Voice' CouplePink: Beautiful Trauma 
Oct. 13PInk has been busier than ever this year, adjusting to life as a family of four, touring the world, shutting down awards shows and gearing up to release her first new album in five years. Beautiful Trauma will feature the politically charged “What About Us” and, if we were the betting kind, we’d bet on plenty more empowering, anthemic and maybe even heartbreaking offerings. We’re glad you’re back, Pink! St. Vincent: MASSEDUCTION
Oct. 13St. Vincent’s summer track, “New York,” is a mournful breakup ballad, but the accompanying video, directed by Alex Da Corte, is anything but. Full of vivid colors and dazzling backdrops, the video offers a striking contrast to the singer’s disdain for the “motherf**ker” that wronged her. “I think Annie's New York is the New York of my dreams -- one that is blurry and fractured, dreamy and flat," Da Corte said in a statement to ET. “It is the Toontown to my Hollywood. It is beautiful but slightly out of reach.”The full-length album, MASSEDUCTION, is co-produced by St. Vincent (aka Annie Clark) and Jack Antonoff. According to a press release, it includes lyrical themes of “power and sex, imperiled relationships and death.” Beck: Colors
Oct. 13It’s been more than three years since Beck’s GRAMMY-winning Morning Phase, with Colors marking his 13th overall studio album. The artist told NME to expect 10 songs that are  “simple and uplifting and galvanizing, where the spirit moves you, that kind of feeling. Those are the hardest.”Gucci Mane: Mr. Davis
Oct. 13After the release date was pushed back a month, we'll have to wait a little longer for the rapper's 11th studio record. Gucci dropped a collaboration with The Weeknd, "Curve," last week. The album boasts several features, including Migos, A$AP Rocky, ScHoolboy Q and Big Sean, which means it will hopefully be worth the wait.Darius Rucker: When Was the Last Time
Oct. 20Rucker teamed with producer Ross Copperman on his sixth solo endeavor, resulting in a fresh, new sound. “He’s young and high energy so I’m really excited for people to hear it,” Rucker tells ET. “There’s one song with me and Jason Aldean and Charles Kelley and Luke Bryan and it’s a lot of fun. … Those guys are my friends. We hang out and play golf and talk. Luke keeps telling me he’s gonna take me hunting.”Chris Young: Losing Sleep
Oct. 20Just days after his induction into the historic Grand Ole Opry, Young will unveil his sixth studio album. The release follows a banner year for the country star, who scored a GRAMMY nomination in 2016 for his megahit duet with Cassadee Pope, “Think of You.” This time around, Young appears to be flying solo on all 10 of the album cuts. Weezer: Pacific Daydream
Oct. 27Weezer’s 11th studio album features the tracks “Feels Like Summer” and “Beach Boys,” and was once described by frontman Rivers Cuomo as if “the Beach Boys and The Clash fell in love by the ocean and had one hell of an amazing baby.”Kelly Clarkson: The Meaning of Life
Oct. 27“THIS is the album I’ve always wanted to make,” Clarkson gushed of her Atlantic Records debut, Meaning of Life. When the American Idol alum first announced her label change back in June, she promised to deliver albums in a variety of different genres down the line -- country, Broadway and pop, among them -- but up first: “a soulful record.” And, so far, she’s delivered with the ultra-sexy single, “Love So Soft.”Ty Dolla $ign: Beach House 3
Oct. 27Dolla $ign continues his prolific release schedule with the third installment of Beach House, which the rapper previously announced would be a full album, rather than a mixtape. We've heard "Love U Better" featuring Lil Wayne and The-Dream back in July, and "So Am I" and "Dawsin’s Breek" featuring Jeremih. The album also features other collaborations, including Skrillex, and will arrive just in time for the end of October.Blake Shelton: Texoma Shore
Nov. 3Texoma Shore is Shelton’s 11th studio album and represents something of a homecoming for the Oklahoma native. "Lake Texoma has always been a place of great memories, new and old," Shelton said in a press release announcing the project. "I literally recorded this album on its shore so it’s full circle for me to take the love of this place and my love of country music."Gwen Stefani's Kids Adorably Dance in Blake Shelton's New Music Video -- Watch!Kelsea Ballerini: Unapologetically
Nov. 3With her sophomore album, Ballerini is out to show a more grown-up side of herself. "I feel like it'll be different, but not in a drastic way where anybody feels like I'm trying to change my identity. It's not like that," she told ET earlier this year. "My first record, I really wanted it to capture 12-21, so it's younger and youthful and it's flirty. This one's definitely more mature because I'm writing it from 21-23 and my life's changed a lot. I went through a gross breakup and then I had some growing up discovery years, and then I met [fiance Morgan Evans]. So I think it captures all of that."Taylor Swift: reputation
Nov. 10Swift's highly anticipated 1989 follow-up is undoubtedly poised for a huge release, with its lead single, “Look What You Made Me Do,” already shattering records across the board. While the songwriter is showing off a fiery new side of herself -- both lyrically and sonically with “Look,” pushing her pop sensibilities further than ever before -- the 15-track album also promises to deliver new twists on the catchy love songs that made her a star (“...Ready for It?,” for starters). Various Artists (Issa Rae, SZA and more): Insecure (Music From the HBO Original Series), Season 2
Sept. 8In addition to a stellar season two, Issa Rae and music supervisor Kier Lehman made sure Insecure had all-new music from some of hip-hop and R&B’s buzziest artists featured on the show. “TV and soundtracks are ways of discovery that are becoming more and more prominent,” Lehman told Vulture. “We want to be a place for artists that wouldn’t have this opportunity for exposure to come to and have fans connect with through the scenes.” In addition to Rae’s hilarious raps, the soundtrack features not one, but two songs from 2017’s breakout star SZA, including the new record, “Quicksand.”
 Wishful Thinking…This section is titled “Wishful Thinking” because, well, none of these albums actually have release dates yet. However, these artists have been teasing us with new singles, hints and, in some cases, promises of new full-lengths to be delivered by the end of the year. Here’s what we’re keeping our fingers crossed for in the upcoming months… Chris Stapleton: From a Room Vol. 2
TBD If loving two Stapleton records in the same calendar year is wrong, we don’t want to be right… From a Room: Vol. 1 was released in May and, at the time, plans to release Vol. 2 later in the year were announced. No word yet on an exact street date. Tim McGraw and Faith Hill: Untitled Duets Album
TBDAs the country couple’s Soul2Soul tour rolls on through October, we’re still waiting on official details for their impending duets album on Sony Music Entertainment, which is expected to feature their latest song, “Speak to a Girl.” Jennifer Lopez: Untitled Spanish-Language Album
TBDIt’s been nearly a year since J.Lo announced that she was teaming up with ex-hubby Marc Anthony to produce her forthcoming Spanish-language LP. While fans were anticipating an October 2017 release from the Bronx-born superstar, an official release date has not yet been announced. We did, however, get our first taste of the album in the form of a dance-y new single, “Ni Tu Ni Yo.” Post Malone: Beerbongs & Bentleys
TBDMalone hasn't come out with a release date since announcing his sophomore album at the end of last year, but the Texas-by-way-of-New York rapper finally dropped the album's lead single, "rockstar," featuring 21 Savage, which has been dominating Spotify's US, Global and Viral 50 charts.Travis Scott & Quavo
TBDWith Quavo and Migos' at large virtual ubiquity on music features this year, the Atlanta rapper's collaboration with Scott is the newest hotly anticipated hip-hop collaboration record. While no release date has been announced, Quavo told Montreality in a recent interview that the pair have recorded over 20 tracks for the project.Marshmello
TBDThe 21-year-old DJ looks poised to breakout from the "extravagantly masked" EDM artists category with high-profile collaborations, including one with Selena Gomez teased earlier this summer, and "Silence," Marshmello's new single with Khalid, rising on streaming charts now. No release date yet, but this one's been bubbling up for awhile and we expect a release sooner rather than later this year.Sam Smith
TBDSmith made his triumphant return to the spotlight earlier this month with the melancholy “Too Good at Goodbyes,” the first single from his highly anticipated sophomore album. "There was a period, when making the record, that I was in a really bad place,’" he told Elton Johnin an interview forAttitude magazine. "‘I got dumped, which wasn’t very nice. Writing music about that kind of thing is normally like therapy for me, but when I got dumped this time 'round I just couldn’t write for about two months... My team had to force me to get into the studio, because I almost felt as if I didn’t want to do it any more. So, there were moments on there where it got a bit intense and I started to lose myself."A release date for Smith’s next album has not yet been announced. 2017 Fall TV Preview: Meet the 9 Breakout Stars You Need to Know!Honorable Mention

Following The Handmaid’s Tale and Big Little Lies’ big wins at the Emmys, where women truly shone this year, it’s hard not to celebrate the women behind the scenes responsible for some of TV’s best scripted programming.The fall will continue the momentum with a number of new and returning shows created, produced, written and directed by women. And this year, several networks have launched programs to encourage and diversify the creative teams behind TV. NBC, which says all of its new and returning shows have female writers in their writers rooms and has female producers on 14 scripted series, has announced an initiative called Female Forward. The program, starting during the 2018-19 season, will give 10 female directors the opportunity to shadow on at least three episodes of a NBC series, with a guarantee to direct one in-season episode. It’s similar to FX and longtime collaborator Ryan Murphy’s current program, Half initiative, which aims to creative equal opportunities for women and minorities behind the camera. In 2016, the number of female and diverse directors on the network’s shows was 51 percent, up from 12 percent in the previous season. And on Murphy’s shows, like American Horror Story: Cult, at least half of the episodes are directed by women. The same is true for NBC’s Law & Order True Crime: The Menendez Murders, which will see half its first season helmed by female directors including Lesli Linka Glatter, who has been nominated for five directing Emmys (including this year, when she lost to Reed Morano). Check out all the series -- new and returning -- largely directed, written and produced by women coming this fall.2017 Fall Preview: ET's Complete Coverage9JKL (CBS)Dana Klein co-created the new CBS sitcom with husband (and star) Mark Feuerstein. The multicamera series is loosely based on their real-life experiences as a couple, when Feuerstein was shooting the USA series Royal Pains. Dana Honor and Wendi Trilling also serve as executive producers and longtime How I Met Your Mother director Pamela Fryman helmed the pilot.Alias Grace (Netflix)Another Margaret Atwood novel gets the TV treatment, with her 1996 fictionalized account of the 1843 murders of Thomas Kinnear and his housekeeper at the center of the story. Sarah Polley wrote and produced the new limited series, which is directed by Mary Harron. Rising Canadian actress Sarah Gadon stars with Anna Paquin in a supporting role. Director Sarah Polley and Anna Paquin in a scene from 'Alias Grace.'

      American Horror Story: Cult(FX)In addition to producers Alexis Martin Woodall, Karen Romero and Crystal Liu, FX and Ryan Murphy are making good on their promise to include more women behind the camera with Angela Bassett, Gwyneth Horder-Payton, Jennifer Lynch, Liza Johnson, Maggie Kiley and Rachel Goldberg directing over half of Cult’s 11 episodes. “Normally you have to bring in the National Guard for that kind of stuff,” Johnson told ET of FX. The network took “this dare,” she notes, and “I think that’s kind of amazing.”Better Things (FX)Fresh off the series’ first Emmy nomination (for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series), Pamela Adlon is back with season two of Better Things, which she co-created with Louis C.K. This season, Adlon directed every episode in addition to serving as star, showrunner and co-writer. (M. Blair Breard, who also works on One Mississippi, co-executive produces.) “I have a vision and an aesthetic and a style that really lent itself to me taking over in every way on my show,” she told The Cut. “In that way it became a lot easier for me to execute this whole season.”Black Mirror: “Arkangel” (Netflix)While creator Charlie Brooker is largely the mastermind behind Black Mirror -- he has a writing credit on every episode of the series except one -- he does bring in award-winning directors to bring his anthology series alive. Season four sees Jodie Foster helming one episode, “Arkangel,” becoming the series’ first and only female director. Meanwhile, Foster has become a formidable TV (and Emmy-nominated) director, helming episodes of Netflix’s Orange Is the New Black and House of Cards, which earned Laverne Cox and Reg E. Cathey Emmy nominations and Uzo Aduba her first of two Emmy wins.Broad City (Comedy Central)Co-creators and executive producers Abbi Jacobson and Ilana Glazer are back with season four of Broad City, which has become a hilarious showcase for female friendships in addition to being a place that’s hosted a number of kick-ass female cameos, including Alia Shawkat, Cynthia Nixon, Kelly Ripa, Patricia Clarkson, Rachel Dratch, Tracee Ellis Ross and Hillary Clinton, “The extraordinary experience of not only working with two stupidly funny people -- it’s not even right how funny they are -- but on top of that, they are women and they also write and produce and edit and do all of that stuff on their show. The experience of that was the biggest and most wonderful breath of fresh air,” Ross told ET about appearing on season three, adding: “To see women in these comedic roles on a weekly basis is everything and a bag of chips!” Amy Poehler, Brooke Posch and Lilly Burns serve as executive producers, with Lucia Aniello, who wrote and directed Rough Night, serving as co-executive producer. Jodie Foster and a scene from the "Arkangel" episode of 'Black Mirror' season four.

No one makes me laugh harder,” she told Motto.Chicago-Law & Order Universe (NBC)Dick Wolf’s ever-expanding TV universe, which started with Law & Order and now includes Special Victims Unit, True Crime and the Chicago series (Fire, Med, P.D.), has become dominated by women behind the scenes: SVU is now executive produced by longtime writer Julie Martin and star Mariska Hargitay.

Jimmy Kimmel has found a cause beyond comedy."I never imagined I would get involved in something like this, this is not my area of expertise."Despite the 49-year-old comedian’s concession during the first of three monologues this week calling out Senator Bill Cassidy for what Kimmel believes are broken promises of the Cassidy-coined “Jimmy Kimmel Test” in the proposed Graham-Cassidy healthcare bill, the Jimmy Kimmel Live! host has become an unlikely leading voice in the fight to save the Affordable Care Act.While Cassidy himself and proponents of the bill argue that Kimmel misrepresents what it actually does, many healthcare analysts have come to the comedian’s defense, stating that he paints a more accurate picture of what the bill could do.Wherever you fall in this debate, it’s hard to argue that Kimmel hasn’t done his homework. His son, Billy’s, own struggles with congenital heart disease has made Kimmel a passionate Obamacare advocate, and it’s shown in both his heartfelt monologues, as well as his social media presence. EXCLUSIVE: Jimmy Kimmel's Son is 'Doing Great,' Will Have Surgery AgainHere are 11 of the most emotional moments from Kimmel this week.1. "Bill Cassidy just lied right to my face.""So 'yup' is Washington for 'nope,' I guess," Kimmel said in his first monologue, after showing a clip of the senator vowing on his show to only support a healthcare plan that passes the "Jimmy Kimmel Test."2. "I am politicizing my son's health problems because I have to.""My family has health insurance, we don't have to worry about this," Kimmel argued in defense of himself joining the healthcare debate. "But other people do, so you can shove your disgusting comments where your doctor won't be giving you a prostate exam once they take your healthcare benefits away."3. "You have to do this, you can't just click 'like' on this video.""If this bill isn't good enough for you, call your congressperson," Kimmel urged his viewers.4. "There's a new 'Jimmy Kimmel Test' for you."
"You're welcome to stop by and take it anytime," Kimmel concluded his first monologue.MORE: Jimmy Kimmel Brings 5-Month-Old Son Billy to L.A. Fundraiser Event -- See the Adorable Family Pics!5. "Which part don't I understand?""Oh, I get it, I don't understand, 'cause I'm a talk show host," Kimmel said in his second monologue, in response to Cassidy telling CNN that Kimmel "doesn't understand" his bill. "Help me out, which part don't I understand? Is it the part where you cut $243 billion from healthcare assistance? ... Where states would be allowed to let insurance companies price you out of coverage for having pre-existing conditions?" And he went on.
"Or could it be, Senator Cassidy, that I do understand, and you got caught with your G.O.Penis out?" he added.6.

Ooooh, I'll pound you next time I see you," said Kimmel, saving some of his harshest words for the Fox & Friends host, who Kimmel claims secretly "wants so bad to be a part of the Holllywood elite," despite rallying against it on his program.Kimmel's wife and co-head writer Molly McNearny also explained why the couple had no choice but to speak out on Twitter, writing, "It would be irresponsible knowing what we know and experiencing what we experienced to 'stay in our lane.' Move over.

In its fourth season, Transparent delves into more of the Pfefferman family ancestry and anxiety -- if the latter were possible. As the crew travels to Israel so Maura can attend a conference, the Holy Land serves as a place for revelations and realizations for everyone. Back home in California, Davina’s origin story becomes clearer as she struggles with her own illness and her place in life and stars in the first nude scene of a transperson on television. “First, television has never seen a trans person, certainly with the age I am and with the body that I have, naked on television,” says Alexandra Billings, who plays Davina. “There is a care that Jill and the writers took -- it wasn’t about fetishizing or sexualizing, and it wasn’t desexualized. It was simple, plain conversation.”Soloway, who identifies as nonbinary and uses the pronoun “they,” began Transparent pulling from their own experiences with their transgender parent. In the first season, as Jeffrey Tambor’s character transitions from identifying as Mort to Maura, her personal journey causes reverberations across her family, including her ex-wife Shelly, son Josh and daughters Sarah and Ali. The second and third seasons delve into what people think they want and, instead, their journeys to what they need. Season four is a bit of a reckoning as well, as the next leg of the Pfeffermans’ trip to self-discovery plays out not in Los Angeles so much as on camels and amidst shooting guns at dusty Israeli hills.Soloway and Billings spoke to ET about the Pfeffermans’ next phase, what Shelly, a cis white woman, might have in common with “baby Davina,” a transgender girl of color, and how they’re aiming to illuminate the true meaning of intersectionality by weaving those stories together in the next phase of this groundbreaking show.MORE: Jill Soloway on Patriarchy, Privilege and Flipping the Male GazeET: Each season of “Transparent” has a different theme, and this one seems to be how everyone is interconnected in their sadness, thanks to whatever personal demon they’re fighting.Jill Soloway: Gosh, I felt like things were getting a little less sad this season.Alexandra Billings: I did, too.Soloway: Things are getting funnier and sillier; they’re all on a trip together, there are hijinks.But there’s a dead person, Rita, following Josh around the whole time.Soloway: You’re right, there is a dead person. It’ll be less sad in season five. We think of it like a melancholy and uncomfortable pleasure you get from the pain in Transparent.Because people are growing and moving through it, like when Maura and Ali are traveling to Israel for what they think is just a conference but the trip becomes so much more.Soloway: Yeah, it’s real, hard and uncomfortable, but then it gives birth to good stuff. A lot of other shows are just all pain or all pleasure -- I’ve been trying to do the roller coaster thing.Billings: There’s a great moment that Maura has when she’s in the airport, and she puts her hands up and says, “If you need me to be a fucking chicken, I’ll be a fucking chicken!” There’s this horrible thing she’s going through, which as a trans person, you just go, “This is the most awful thing,” and Tambor pulls this gift out of the center of his heart space.Soloway: The airport scene is a pretty common thing, people want to “out” you. A lot of trans people have been through something just like that.Billings: Especially if you’re a trans person of color. Every time I travel with my wife, Chrisanne, who’s as white as white can be, security loves to touch my hair -- which I’m like, don’t touch the motherfucking hair -- I am searched and she is not. I’m flying first class now, and I or my suitcase am always stopped.You’d think going through the airport would be simple, but really… Billings: I was talking to some girlfriends of mine about the great juxtaposition in this show between about trans people who are passable and those who are not. Maura falls into the container of not passable. Shea, played by Trace Lysette, falls into the passable, and both have their sets of problems because when you look like Shea, you have to explain. Can you imagine going with someone who looks like that but her transness is completely invisible? However, Maura’s is very, very visible. Then you look at Davina -- and this has been true of my life -- and I’m on a spectrum. It really depends on where I am, if I’m passable or not. I’m very out with transness, but not everybody knows at first sight, and that’s troublesome to me.MORE: How Our Lady J Brings Authenticity -- Not Just Tokenism -- to 'Transparent'Do you feel like it’s a gift or a curse?Billings: I think it’s a curse. I don’t like it because I don’t like to have to explain my race or my transness.Speaking of that, how did you feel about the nude scene? I loved the way it was just so pedestrian, like, Davina is in bed with her man, why wouldn’t she be naked?Billings: Jill is changing the face of television. First, television has never seen a trans person, certainly with the age I am and with the body that I have, naked on television. There is a care that Jill and the writers took, because the writers need to be given credit, too. It wasn’t about fetishizing or sexualizing, and it wasn’t desexualized. It was simple, plain conversation, and you’re looking and then go, “Oh, what the --” It takes you into the situation.How did you feel about it, since trans nudity has become so politicized, especially with Laverne Cox having been vocal about saying people don’t have the right to ask her about her body?Billings: I’ve talked to Laverne about this at length, and she since has gone a little away from that, not too far. I go way away from it. I don’t want it to be my whole life, but it’s actually one of the reasons I wanted to do this. I actually talked to Jill about this and said, “I think it’s time,” because if we don’t have the conversation, the situation gets bigger. If you have the conversation, you can be done with it.In interviews, you’ve said that seeing other trans people on television stopped you from taking a fistful of pills. How does it feel to be on the other side of that coin and be the vision of representation for someone else?Billings: I feel insanely lucky, truly and deeply blessed and constantly grateful -- constantly. There was a girlfriend of mine who Trace and I went to lunch with recently, she’s of a certain age, and she’s been living in stealth with her transness. During lunch, she turned to Trace, and she said, very sincerely, “Because of you and because of this show, I now have the strength to stop lying.” This is not a 20-year-old child, this is someone who has had to live this way for a very, very long time. There is this show that has cracked open a conversation that certainly I never thought would be possible, so just to even be a small part of this is quite remarkable.Alexandra Billings as Davina on 'Transparent' season four.

      Are there going to be any trans characters who become series regulars?Soloway: In season five there should be, there could be and we want there to be. Maura and Davina will be living in a house together, so between family, the Pacific Palisades, local politics and hijinks, anything is possible.Jill, a while back you told ET that there wouldn’t be any backstory for characters like Davina, because the show is focused on the Pfeffermans. Now, Davina has an origin story. What changed?Soloway: I don’t know, we don’t really plan it. It comes from this organic place, so to be able to say there will be a trans character who will be a season regular, we’ve tried to do things like that. But in the writers room we’re always trying to figure out what the story is organically with the family. I think now that they’re living together, it’ll be easier. It’s so hard to represent the trans community, which the show does, because it’s called Transparent. We have a cis man in the title role, and that’s problematic, and we have this whole other family, these characters who are not trans, who are considered part of the show. It’s always a struggle to tell all the stories we want to tell. Also, I feel like trans men are like, “Where the fuck is our story?” and gay men say, “What do you have against gay men?”Switching back to Davina’s arc, did the writers cull anything from your personal pageant experience, Alexandra, from competing in the Miss Continental pageant or performing at the Queen Mary?Billings: I remember talking a little bit about it, but that was mostly from the writers’ brains. They’re feverish little manic things. I’ll tell you, though, that scene with Trace in the dressing room where she’s talking to baby Davina --played by Jaime, a former student of mine from Cal State Long Beach -- she is so freaking good. Trace brings her whole experience so bravely into that room, and just watching it, I fell apart. It resonates so deeply with that time period, and it’s a little portal that very few cis people are privy to. It’s the genius of this show, because you get a real look -- and it’s every dressing room I was ever in -- into where we go, whether it’s by choice or by happenstance or by must, but you get a real peek into that world, and that’s extraordinary.It was interesting how the show touched on trans homelessness, when Jaime asks, “Can I stay with you?” and two girls say no because “you know I’m staying with so-and-so.” Soloway: That’s a big question, especially for women, who they perform for for the rent. Cis women, trans women in patriarchy, a way that a lot of people get their access is through men. So when you’re getting your access through men, whether it’s your rent, your attention, your home, your sense of security.MORE: 'Transparent' Star Kathryn Hahn on Her Most Important Working RelationshipI’m glad you brought that up, because I felt like that was another theme.Soloway: Just the feeling of having to perform and not really getting to be yourself. For Davina, her transness is more about how much freedom she wanted and didn’t have, it was an the economic issue. And then we also had this very tiny little theme running through the season that we in the writers room were aware of in that moment when Davina -- she was David then -- didn’t necessarily have the choice to get up and leave [when the man she’s dating wants to have unprotected sex]. How that was connected with her HIV status, what consent actually means, when there’s that moment where her boyfriend and benefactor Roland says, “Come on, baby.” Can you consent if somebody else is paying your rent? We tie that in with Josh and Rita’s consent story and that moment of Shelly getting pregnant by accident. This is who I live with, this is who is in charge of me, these are my options.And this is my financial situation…Soloway: Yeah, we just wanted to draw those little connectors because what I realize [is] we’re always taking about the notion of intersectionality, which as far as I can tell means because of our intersections regarding race, gender and class, we do and don’t have things in common some of the times, and others, we don’t. It’s so broad, but it doesn’t mean solidarity, which people think it means. So that little thing of those two threads is an intersectional storyline, because it asks, what do we have in common here? What does a Jewish woman in the suburbs of L.A. have in common with a little trans girl getting HIV, and the biological results of that, the biological emanations of inability to consent? And for us, we try to weave these things into the background for those who are watching it closely or maybe for a class that people teach. We’re looking for those little sparks of connection to suggest sparks of solidarity within intersectionality.Transparent has moved from telling a narrative to depicting a revolutionary trans nude scene as just another woman lying in bed with her boyfriend. Alexandra, considering your history standing up to the Curb Your Enthusiasm team, who wrote a hurtful scene where a transwoman bails on the line to the ladies’ room for a urinal in the interest of time and you said, ‘I refuse to read for this part and you should change it,’ do you think America has moved past the point of trans people being the butt of the joke?Billings:  Yeah, ish. I think that we have taken a step in the right direction, though we’re at a pause right now with the current government. The people who have kept their true selves silent because they know within themselves what they believe isn’t true, right or kind, have been given permission by all the white cis heteronormative men in power. They are blossoming in this really big way. I’m now a drama professor at University of Southern California, where I’ve been misgendered three times on campus in the three weeks I’ve been there.How can they misgender you when you’re on a very popular TV show?Billings: I’m walking down the main path on campus, and one of the buildings I teach in is where all the jocks hang out and also where I teach theater to the masters students. It’s a very long walk past some field -- I don’t understand sports -- and these two very large gentlemen are coming toward me. My sense is really good, so I knew something was going to happen. So I stopped, and I’m very much owning my own space, and they say to me, “That’s a guy,” one of them said. “That’s a tranny,” and they passed by me, laughing. It was horrible. I took all of that into the classroom, and luckily I am helped by these students in this university in a way that’s really extraordinary. We had a really beautiful day, strangely, but the gift was, this show is reaching the people whether they like it or not. The people who feel like they’re now getting bigger are getting bigger because of this government, they know who I am. I had to bless them and thank them because you know what? 10 years ago, you wouldn’t have known who I was. So, are we the butt of jokes? Yeah. Are we still in the center of violence? Oh, yes. Our suicide rate is 82 percent, we don’t survive. However, the glimmer of light is the fact that the portal is open and everyone is going through it, whether they want to or not.

Danielle Bradbery is holding on to those summer vibes. The 21-year-old songstress, who won the season four of The Voice on Blake Shelton's team, has teamed up with ET to debut one of her catchy new songs, "Hello Summer," which will feature on her next album. I Don't Believe We've Met is set for release on Dec. 1. "Hello Summer" was co-written by Thomas Rhett, Rhett Akins, The Cadillac Three's Jaren Johnston and Julian Bunetta in a session originally intended for Rhett's Life Changes album. When Rhett decided not to select it for this project, he contacted Bradbery. The duo have stayed close since touring together in 2015, with Rhett serving as a mentor in recent years.  "He felt like the song could be re-written with female perspective, so I sat down with his dad [Akins] and he re-wrote some of the lyrics to fit my voice," Bradbery says. "Julian agreed to produce it and I'm so proud of how it turned out. It's one of the few I didn't co-write myself, but I feel really speaks to the same emotional theme of the record and pushes the boundaries sonically into new territory for me." "We jumped in and cranked that story out really quick and then started another," Johnston tells ET, recalling the session. "I really thought it was gonna be on TR's new record, so I was really surprised when I heard Danielle had cut it." "I guess that's what's so great about Nashville and writing country music -- you never know where a good song is gonna find a home," he continues. "I recently heard her version and I love it. What a true talent she is! She killed it." The ironic timing of the song's release isn't lost on Bradbery, who joked about the title in an Instagram post of a yellow shirt that reads, "Goodbye Summer." "Because we are releasing a song called 'Hello Summer' on the first day of fall," she cracked. I Don't Believe We've Met is available for pre-order now.

Barbara Corcoran is meeting a whole different side of herself onDancing With the Stars.ET's Lauren Zima caught up with the businesswoman at Shark Tank's Paley Center premiere event on Wednesday, where she revealed that rehearsals with her partner, Keo Motsepe, had her crying for the first time in 25 years."I spent today three hours in practice and learned exactly three little steps and there's roughly 80 steps in a dance and I have two dances to turn out Saturday. So, needless to say, I had a cry down," Corcoran confessed. "I didn't know I had enough juice in my body to cry. I haven't cried in like, 25 years and I was sobbing all over Keo's lap.""It was terrible. And I can't stand women that cry. I just had a breakdown," she continued.

Marlena forever?Big Brother couple Mark Jansen and Elena Davies plan to turn their showmance into a real-life relationship outside the house. ET caught up with the couple after the season 19 finale on Wednesday night.“I’m crazy about her,” Mark spills. “I didn't expect to have this strong of feelings, these strong of feelings for her. It'll be interesting to see what happens when we step out in the real world. I mean, I'm excited! I'm planning on going down to Dallas for a little bit.”“We had some back and forth in the house,” Elena admits. “It was more so back and forth with me, and a lot of just forth with him.”“I tried very hard to keep my mental health in mind whilst trying to start a relationship with him, and it was challenging to do so in that environment,” she adds. “But the jury house was a nice break. There's no camera, no pressure. So, I would say we passed phase one, and phase two -- he's gonna come hang out in Dallas for a while after this all wraps up and we'll see what happens with phase three of the relationship, if we can make it in the real world.”EXCLUSIVE: ‘Big Brother’ Star Paul on Losing Again and His Pals Victor and Nicole Dating“I enjoy him quite a bit,” Elena says. “I'm excited to see if anything happens. I know he doesn't plan to live in Buffalo, long term … it’s a good sign.”“I never met anybody like her,” Mark confesses. “Even when she wanted to keep her distance from me, every day she was there for me.”“I don't want to rush it,” he continues. “I'm crazy about her and I'm very excited to see where things go after this experience.“I can't help but be rational and logical in all of this, like, I met a guy in the Big Brother house and he's gonna move to Texas?” Elena shares. “Are you kidding me? Are we all on drugs? That's nuts!”EXCLUSIVE: ‘Big Brother’ Couple Jessica and Cody Talk Next Relationship StepsAlso nuts was the fan reaction to “Thicc Mark.” The personal trainer was an internet favorite all season long for flashing his derriere a lot on the live feeds -- and he’s happy fans enjoyed it.“I love being in the sun, and I love having my a** out and tanning,” he shares. “I wasn't too concerned -- clearly, wasn't concerned at all -- with what was being put on the internet. I hope the internet enjoyed it … men and women! Everybody.”EXCLUSIVE: 'Big Brother' Star Mark Jansen Hopes Fans Enjoyed Seeing His Bare Butt on Live Feeds


Matt Clines and Raven Walton are ready to turn their Big Brother showmance into a romance.“I’m excited to see [what] the future … holds for me and Matthew,” Raven gushes to ET after the finale. “We have connected on a whole new level.”“We're gonna see what happens,” Matt adds. “We're gonna hang around California for a week, spend time with each other. We haven't known each other for a single minute outside of this house, so yeah, I'm excited to get to know Raven outside of the house and see where it goes. I'm excited.”EXCLUSIVE: 'Big Brother' 19's Jessica and Cody on Taking Their Relationship Into the Real World Leaving the Big Brother house also means facing the fans of the show for the first time. Viewers questioned Raven’s backstory a lot, often with the hashtag #ExposeRavenParty. They dug up past local news stories about Raven and her family after the dance teacher shared a lot of information with her fellow houseguests on past medical procedures, diseases and family history, that even some of them questioned. The main stories involved her gastroparesis diagnosis (she has a “pacemaker” that helps her digest food), a bum knee and her mom being a member of Mensa.“If you want to question it, that's fine,” Raven says. “Everyone has the right to their own opinion, but I just really wanted to be an open book. I do have a lot wrong with me and I didn't use it as a crutch. I just wanted to educate people and inspire people.”“I believe everything Raven said in the house,” Matt says. “If she was making that stuff up, that's a heck of a good story, 'cause that is very unique. So, yeah, maybe some of it wasn't true, and I'm assuming she'll let me know if it wasn't. I mean, I did see the scar and the pacemaker, so I'm assuming at least part of that to be true.”EXCLUSIVE: ‘Big Brother’ Host Julie Chen Reacts to Cody Casting the Deciding Vote“A lot of people are like, ‘You don't look sick,’” Raven continues. “I've had that even before I went on the show … Well, you can't see it. There's something wrong with me on the inside. I do have a lot wrong with me, and to clear this up -- I said in the house, my mom could be a part of Mensa. She went to law school. Unfortunately, she got sick and was not able to graduate. She could join Mensa tomorrow. She's a very intelligent woman and I'm proud to be her daughter.”“I'm a sick woman,” she says. “I do have terminal illnesses. I don't let it stop me, I don't let it bring me down.”For more from the Big Brother finale, check out the video below.EXCLUSIVE: 'Big Brother' Star Paul Abrahamian Reacts to Losing AGAIN, Plus Victor and Nicole Dating!








Another summer, another second place finish for Big Brother houseguest Paul Abrahamian.“[The jury votes] honestly surprise me a little bit,” Paul tells ET. “I think everybody was pissed. I was the only vet in the house. I don't know what they expected me to do, just roll over and give them the game? But I wasn't going to do that, so I think when they got to jury, ‘Oh. Paul beat us. Well, I hate him now.'”ET caught up with the two-time runner-up in the Big Brother backyard after Wednesday night’s finale, which saw the jury vote 5-4 to give the $500,000 grand prize to Josh Martinez. Paul says he was most surprised by former allies Alex Ow and Jason Dent’s votes go to Josh, as well as sworn enemy Cody Nickson’s vote.“I didn't think there would be anything on planet Earth sitting next to Josh that Cody would vote for,” he jokes. “But apparently, I’m it."EXCLUSIVE: ‘Big Brother’ Couple Jessica and Cody Talk Next Relationship Steps -- Is Someone Moving?Paul says the jury definitely seemed bitter, but he doesn’t hold his loss against them.“It's like crying over a game of Monopoly,” he says. “I won $50,000, I'm stoked. Whatever. If they didn't want to vote for me, that's on them. They can live with that, whatever weirdness they have inside of them. I know I played the hell out of this season, I gave it all that I could, and if I still dictated second place, then that's what I dictated. I'll take it, put my head up and walk out, with friendship.”Despite two losses, the 24-year-old rocker says he’d head back into the house for a third time immediately.“Look, I put 191 days into this house,” he notes. “Over six months of my life has been lived inside the Big Brother house. I'm definitely insane. I'm on all aspects a sociopath. I would probably do it again. Why? Sadomasochist! Absolutely. But I would totally do it again and hopefully -- at this point, I just want to win second place all the time. Just to keep the ongoing joke running, I just want to win second place forever. So, if they bring me back, I'm shooting for second.”EXCLUSIVE: 'Big Brother' Host Julie Chen Reacts to Josh's Win and Cody Being 'America's Favorite'While we had Paul, we also got his take on the news that his season 18 pals, Victor Arroyo and Nicole Franzel, are dating. The former houseguests reconnected at the season 18 premiere party earlier this summer.“I thought that was a joke,” Paul admits. “He's like, ‘This is my girlfriend.’ I'm like, shut up, Victor. What's up, Nic -- and then they kissed and I was like... alright, well, that's happening now. I wish them luck. That's super bizarre. I hope a weird baby comes out of it that'll be slightly hairy and slightly nerdy all at once. I'm into it.”Fore more on Victor and Nicole’s romance, check out the video below.EXCLUSIVE: Yes, 'Big Brother' 18's Victor Arroyo and Nicole Franzel Are Dating! How They Fell in Love

Val Chmerkovskiy is extremely grateful for his partner on Dancing With the Stars this season.The 31-year-old dancer took to Instagram on Thursday to marvel over former paralympic swimmer Victoria Arlen, who was paralyzed from the waist down for a decade before learning to walk again a year and a half ago. He said that working with Arlen, who's currently a correspondent for ESPN, has given him a newfound "purpose."Chmerkovskiy posted a video from Project Walk Boston, the city where Arlen was born. The video begins with a young boy holding a sign that reads, "Vote for our very own Victoria Arlen!" The rest of the footage shows patients from the paralysis recovery center wishing #TeamViVa good luck in the competition."Like many people out there, I have my moments of severe doubt. Insecurity," Chmerkovskiy captioned it. "I constantly [am] finding myself questioning not just my own worth, but also my impact on the world. How am I contributing? What will I leave behind? Am I really going to be simply remembered as 'that guy from that dance show'? With endless gratitude and the utmost respect, the answer is...absolutely not."MORE: 'Dancing With the Stars' Season 25 Premiere: Best Lifts, Kicks, Tricks and Flips!Chmerkovskiy says that although he's "not sure what the future holds" for him, he's "so grateful" for today."Victoria Arlen has given me a purpose beyond the dance floor," he gushed. "She has given me an opportunity of a lifetime.. to be able to make an impact on a very special community and beyond.""Today I'm showing up to work, as a man with a higher purpose and a drive beyond just doing another turn or dip, even though I think we can all agree that there are very few things more fun than a good 'ol dip," he added. "I'm going to work knowing that with this great opportunity comes a massive responsibility. I'm going to seize the blessings that are right there in front of me, not a single breath for granted, not a moment left empty of joy and gratitude, and who knows maybe through the laughter, the struggle, the ultimate joy we show on Monday, we can inspire the next Victoria Arlen."See his full post below:When ET spoke with Chmerkovskiy backstage at DWTS on Monday, he echoed these sentiments about Arlen."Oh my god, [she's taught me] how lucky I am, how grateful I am and, as grateful as I am, how much joy I could still have," he explained. "It's hard work to be happy, it takes effort and the effort is in reminding yourself how beautiful you have it, and she's a reminder of that every day. I get a little ray of sunshine every single day I go to work and that's a blessing in itself."Dancing With the Stars returns next Monday at 8 p.m. ET/PT on ABC.EXCLUSIVE: Victoria Arlen Tears Up After Stunning Debut on 'DWTS,' Explains Why It Was 'Emotional'  Related GalleryThe Complete List: 'Dancing with the Stars' Winners

Get ready to see a whole new side of the beauty industry.ET was on set of Lifetime’s American Beauty Star -- a new competition series that aims do for hair and makeup artists what Project Runway has done for fashion designers -- with host Adriana Lima, contestant mentor Sir John (Beyonce’s personal makeup artist!), and judge Sarah Brown, Vogue contributing editor, to find out why it took until 2017 to make a show like this happen.“This is such an exciting time for beauty,” Brown gushes. “What's been amazing in the last year or two is that we've seen the definition of beauty expand, to be so much more inclusive than it ever has been.”“Right now, the conversation is so broad and includes every gender, every ethnicity, every type of person, every everything,” she continues. “There's just room for everyone, and makeup brands are getting on board with that, the modeling agencies. Everything is changing, and so this show is at the perfect time [to] capture that moment of inclusion and this expanding definition of beauty.”'American Beauty Star' Season 1 Trailer: It's 'Project Runway' for Hair and Makeup Artists!Brown describes the show as “boundary-breaking,” and Sir John notes social media has totally changed the game.“From Harlem to Hong Kong, you can hashtag any popular lipstick shade, or hairspray, and you'll see a mosaic of women wearing hijab, or one is in Ireland, one is in Korea, getting ready for a date night, or in Dubai,” he says. “You didn't see that years prior. So, I love that that's happening, and we're on a path to see a huge shift or turn of beauty, and if we're at the top of the roller coaster, it's just a really good ride to be a part of.”The cast promises the 12 contestants are taking beauty places viewers won’t expect, surprising even them week after week.“We're seeing incredible transformations,” Brown shares. “Attitudes change … I think that men will be watching, too ... boys and men [can find] something for themselves in beauty, whether they wanted to do it to someone else or they want to put it on their own face, and we're at this great moment right now, culturally, you know, where that's becoming acceptable, which is a huge leap, you know?”EXCLUSIVE: Heidi Klum Says 'Project Runway' Designers 'Weren't Happy' About Dressing Models of All Sizes“What I love about this show so much is that it's showing what is behind the creativity process,” Lima jumps in. “The positive, the nervousness, the struggles, and overcoming the struggles. It's so beautiful to see someone grow in so many different ways, and that's what you'll be watching at home.”“When you look at beauty, as a whole, there's an emotional connection that happens with the viewer,” John adds, explaining what sets the show apart from shows like Project Runway or Top Chef.“There's an emotional connection that happens with a woman and her mirror,” he continues. “If you've ever given a cancer survivor a new way to ... fill in her eyebrows in a way she hasn't prior, that emotional thing that happens, that lore is something you can't imitate with fashion or [other] programs that have come prior. So hopefully viewers can connect in a very personal way, as well.”Adriana Lima Wears Diamond Wedding Band, Declares 'I Am Committed to Myself'“Beauty has everything to do with a woman's personal journey, and it has to do with you know, who she wants to be,” he adds. “It's armor. It's an arsenal, at the end of the day … it changes your sense of well-being and give you a sense of pride in yourself.”But don’t worry -- the show still delivers the drama you’ve come to expect from reality TV.“It's emotional,” Brown teases. “There's backbiting … every element that goes into a really fun TV show is in this show, and then the thing that's really cool is, it's totally real.”“It's important for this to be socially relevant,” she wraps up. “If we did a show about who does the best smokey eye, I don't want to watch that show.”American Beauty Star premieres Thursday, Sept. 21, at 10:30 p.m. ET.

The future of killer robots is here.James Cameron revealed during a recent private event that Linda Hamilton is attached to his and Arnold Schwarzenegger's planned reboot of the Terminator franchise, The Hollywood Reporterfirst reported.In his remarks, Cameron highlighted the importance of Hamilton's tough and badass heroine, Sarah Connor -- who appeared in the franchise's first three films, as well as 2009's Termination Salvation -- returning for the reboot, noting that the aging acting hero is a trope usually only reserved for men."There are 50-year-old, 60-year-old guys out there killing bad guys,” he explained.  “but there isn’t an example of that for women.”In August, Cameron sat down with ET's Ash Crossan to discuss the future of the franchise, and how much the modern era of drones and artificial intelligence will shape the time-jumping, apocalyptic world."We have to ask ourselves some fundamental questions: Is there something that can be said in this Terminator universe that hasn't been said -- and is relevant to the world we're in right now?" the 63-year-old director posited. "There's so much in our world that's catching up to Terminator. We have killer robots, they're called unpiloted combat drones ... we're on the cusp of artificial intelligence that could be equal of a human intelligence.""So we got to start asking ourselves what that means for our existence as a society and for our own sense of meaning," he added.EXCLUSIVE: The One Scene James Cameron Changed in 'Terminator 2' Re-Release: 'It Just Bugged Me'Basically, Cameron admitted that when it comes to dramatizing Terminator with that lens, things could get pretty bleak."This is where fiction comes in," he said. "It allows us to explore different possibilities, so obviously if we were to explore it in a Terminator, the context is all going to be very negative."Flashback: Arnold Schwarzenegger Compares ET to the Terminator on the Set of 'Terminator 2'The director and his creative team have a long time to grapple with these questions, as the new Terminator won't "be back" until after 2019.Meanwhile, Cameron also opened up to ET about the one scene he just had to change in Terminator 2.

Sasha Farber is sharing secrets from the ballroom!
The 33-year-old dancer stopped by ET for a Facebook Live interview on Tuesday, where he opened up about why he's not a pro on Dancing With the Stars this season, which pairs have the best chance at taking home the mirrorball trophy, and, of course, wedding planning with his fiancee, Emma Slater.
Just last season, Farber competed with Olympic gymnast Simone Biles, placing fourth in the competition. He also was a pro during seasons 17, 22 and 23, paired with Nicole "Snooki" Polizzi, Kim Fields and Terra Jole, respectively. So after four amazing seasons, why was Farber placed in the troupe for the dance competition show's 25th anniversary?
"The show changes. They always bring different people in," Farber told ET's Cameron Mathison and Lauren Zima. "And it's always -- it's a height issue for me, too. Everyone's pretty tall [this season], not going to lie."MORE: 'Dancing With the Stars' Season 25 Premiere: Best Lifts, Kicks, Tricks and Flips!Farber said that the DWTS team was "very professional" when they delivered the news to him.
"There's Joe [Sungkur], Ashley [Edens-Shaffer] and Deena [Katz] in the room and they all -- Deena cried," he recalled. "It was one of those things where they just couldn't really do much about it and I totally understand. It's a business thing. I'm still proud of the family and we're going on tour and it's good. It's good to be in the ballroom."
Although he seemed to be pretty bummed about the news at first, he says he's now "doing great."
"I'm not going to lie, it was a little bit weird to be in the ballroom [this week] and not getting to compete," he admitted. "The best part of [the show] is doing the creative aspect of it. Getting someone who has never danced before and transforming them into this superstar, and they become a true dancer with the knowledge that you give them."
"But I mean, I'm still there and I get to perform," Farber added, explaining that it also feels "nice" to just sit back and watch everyone dance. "Once you're in the Dancing With the Stars family, you're in the family. And it really is a family. All the pros love each other, all the celebs become amazing friends."Monday night's premiere featured highly entertaining performances from this season's contestants. Obviously, we had to ask Farber about which stars really blew him away. Here's what he had to say about some of his top picks:Jordan Fisher & Lindsay Arnold
"First of all, he annihilated it. It was like watching two pros dance. And you know, he improved so [much]. No joke, from the camera blocking to the dress rehearsal, which is, like, maybe a two-hour rehearsal? So different. His frame changed. His posture changed. He became a different person. He was just sharp … I can definitely see them going all the way, but it's going to be tight. There's a lot of talent."Vanessa Lachey & Maksim Chmerkovskiy
"I did NOT expect her to be that good, for sure!"Emma Slater & Drew Scott
"He is a tall guy. Len [Goodman] said it best, he's definitely a 'fixer-upper.' And his personality and dedication is brilliant. He's so dedicated."
Farber also noted that Slater and Scott are "traveling more than anyone in the show."
"I think Emma will be traveling to Canada every week after the show. I feel like Emma literally said bye to me at 3 a.m. today in the morning," he shared. I was like, 'Bye!'"So with Slater in Canada and Farber in Los Angeles, both constantly busy in rehearsals, are they still able to make time for wedding planning?
"Yes, every day," the Moscow, Russia, native shared. "We want to kind of do it in March, but it's just so hard with the tours and the seasons ... we kind of want to do a quick wedding and just get it over and done with."

"I've never been more scared in my life," he joked. "I had to dance before and I was like, 'I don't even know what's coming next.' I had the ring in my pocket and I was worried she was going to feel it or it was going to fall out. Then, I couldn't even get it out when -- I was trying to shake."
"It was just scary and I don't even really remember it perfectly," he added. "But it's one of those things where our families are on separate sides of the world, so it was good for them to kind of see it [together]."

Adriana Lima wants to change your idea of “beauty.”The Brazilian supermodel is stepping out of her comfort zone to host Lifetime’s new competition series, American Beauty Star. Think  Project Runway, but for hair and makeup artists. The 36-year-old confesses she totally reached out to Runway host, and fellow Victoria’s Secret Angel, Heidi Klum for tips.“Honestly, when I received the call [to host] I was like, ‘Holy s**t!” Adriana tells ET on the series' L.A. set. “Is that truth? I did not believe it. I swear. I did not believe it. Me, really? With this accent? Really, me? I did not believe it at all.”“I love the show,” she adds. “It’s showing the human side of [the industry]. What goes behind creating a look, what emotions? Where do you find creation, and where do you find creativity?”Alessandra Ambrosio, Adriana Lima and More Victoria's Secret Models Take Over Asia -- See the Pics!EXCLUSIVE: Adriana Lima Reveals When She Feels Most Beautiful -- and Why She 'Married' HerselfEXCLUSIVE: Adriana Lima Reveals When She Feels Most Beautiful -- and Why She 'Married' Herself  The series, premiering Sept 21, pits 12 salon professionals against each other in weekly challenges designed to highlight different facets of the beauty world.“We have challenges from makeovers, to a beauty pop-up bar, red carpet look,” Adriana explains. “Some challenges where they get to express themselves and personalities, or express how they could change the world in different ways.”Adriana admits “everything” about the show surprises her, and that she’s learned a lot from filming, from how to host (“Whoa!”) to beauty tips and tricks.“I learned to embrace the simple things throughout the whole process,” she shares. “It’s about standing up for what you believe ... I find imperfections, mistakes beautiful, too.”The mom of two says she hopes the show will challenge how people view the beauty industry. It’s not all skin deep.“We’re not only celebrating physical beauty, because creation is the start the beauty,” she says. “And how does that happen? Emotions, heart. That’s how the creation process starts. So it’s much more than only appearance and what is put outside. The artist has some kind of connection [to] whatever they are expressing.”Adriana Lima Locks Lips With Metin Hara While on Vacation in Turkey -- See the Steamy Pic!“I think that the industry’s changed,” she adds. “Everyone wants to feel connected with the person behind the makeup or whatever, the picture. People want to see that human connection … [for] my children, I think there’s a lot of positive messages in fashion and in beauty, and those messages are the ones I will embrace and I will reinforce into my children’s lives.”In fact, Adriana says she has no qualms about letting her daughters with ex Marko Jaric, 7-year-old Valentina and 5-year-old Sienna, enter the business.“I have one possible candidate [for modeling],” she teases. “I will not name her, because I don’t know, she may change her mind and I don’t want her to have pressure from everyone out there, OK? So, there is a possibility and whatever is her decision I will be right there, supportive.”Adriana Lima Wears Diamond Wedding Band, Declares 'I Am Committed to Myself'Adriana says she hopes she leads by example for her girls, showing them beauty can be whatever you think it is.“I feel the most beautiful when I’m myself, expressing my feelings,” she says. “If I put on a red lipstick, because I love a red lipstick just because, I don’t have an explanation for that. That’s when I feel beautiful. If I don’t want to use anything, I don’t want to use anything.”That thought process was part of the reason behind a viral Instagram she shared in May, where she announced she was single, claiming she “married” herself. (Adriana has since gone on to enter a relationship with spiritual healer Metin Hara.)“It’s like a symbolic thing,” she says of the post. “It’s talking about loving yourself. That’s how everything starts. If you’re incapable of loving your own self, how can you love anyone else in your life, if you don’t know how to embrace you?”For more on American Beauty Star, check out the video below.'American Beauty Star' Season 1 Trailer: It's 'Project Runway' for Hair and Makeup Artists!

Queensland's economic forecast is looking better than predicted since this year's budget with strong coal royalties giving treasury coffers good news this Christmas.

The mid-year economic review shows the state's debt won't be as high as predicted this year but is still on track to hit $81 billion by 2020.
After taking over the portfolio from Curtis Pitt in a cabinet reshuffle, new Treasurer Jackie Trad's first Mid Year Fiscal and Economic Review (MYFER) is forecasting a net surplus of $485 million, three times higher than the budget forecast.
It comes off the back of record export figures, and strong resources royalties with the price of coal not dropping as expected.
Coal royalties for the year are now expected to be $3.164 billion, which is $414 million higher than forecast six months ago.
"The price of coal is up which means royalties are up and as a result the Queensland budget has done much better," Ms Trad said.
However, while Queensland's budget bottom line is looking rosier in the short term, thanks mainly to coal royalties, surpluses will remain relatively modest and there'll be no major reduction in debt.
Surpluses ranging from $165 million to $531 million are also predicted for the following years.
"These surpluses are working for Queensland, reducing the need for borrowing and going towards our growing infrastructure program," Ms Trad said.
Total government debt in 2017-18 is now expected to reach $71.2 billion — almost $800 million less than the June forecast.
However, the MYFER shows that debt is still on track to reach nearly $81 billion by 2020-21.
"The borrowings are down, we are predicting less borrowings over the forward estimates than we were in the June budget," Ms Trad said.
"Clearly our debt reduction plan has worked and worked quite significantly and we will continue to follow through with that and adhere to our principles.
"But there is further work that we are going to be doing from this time until the next budget to look at our debt position."
Taxation revenue will grow as expected after Labor announced four new taxes during the recent election campaign.
The increases in land tax, foreign duty, premium car duty and online betting will earn an extra $491 million over three years from 2018-19.
Another billion dollars in public sector savings will go towards Labor's election promises.
"Where there are duplicate programs all with the same intention, amalgamating them, finding efficiencies, is particularly a good way of reprioritising some of the excesses within government," Ms Trad said.
Economic growth forecasts are unchanged in the MYFER: 2.75 per cent for 2017-18 and 3 per cent for 2018-19.
But the 1 per cent growth in employment has been upgraded to 2.25 per cent.
"In summary the MYFER shows that we have fully funded our election commitments, that surpluses are up, that debt is down and we will continue to lead the nation in strong jobs growth," Ms Trad said.
But opposition spokesman for treasury Tim Mander said it was a typical Labor budget document.
"Spending is up, taxes are up and the debt continues to increase," Mr Mander said.
"This government has benefited by good luck rather than good management, by the increase in coal royalties."

With less than a week to go, a number of ASX-listed companies have scrambled to finalise their deals before Christmas.
One of them is construction software business Aconex, which is due to be taken-over by US software giant Oracle.
The other is Kogan.com, which is branching out of its online retail business to offer pet insurance.
Aconex was, by far, the best-performing stock on the Australian share market on Monday — jumping 44.2 per cent to $7.63.
Its value surged after Oracle made a $1.56 billion offer to purchase the company, which works out to be $7.80 per share.
This was 47.4 per cent premium to what it was worth last Friday ($5.29).
The Melbourne-based software company specialises in web-based project management software that allows input from different teams.
In a statement, Aconex said its directors — who collectively control 13.6 per cent of the company — had unanimously recommended that its shareholders accept the offer.
"Oracle's offer of $7.80 per share represents a significant premium and a high degree of certainty of value to shareholders through the cash offer and limited conditionality," Aconex chairman Adam Lewis said.
The next step in the process is for Aconex shareholders to vote on this deal at a meeting in March next year.
The company expects the deal to close in the first half of next year — provided it gets approved by the Federal Court and Foreign Investment Review Board.
Shares in Kogan.com were the eighth-best performing stock on the local bourse, lifting 10.3 per cent to a record-high of $5.46.
This was after the online retailer announced it had signed an agreement with pet insurance company PetSure, a subsidiary of the South-African based Hollard Insurance Company.
From the first half of next year, Kogan will sell "affordable pet insurance products" under a new brand, Kogan Pet Insurance.
Kogan will also earn commission from each pet insurance policy issued — but did not say how much it would be.
"Pet insurance is a growing insurance category in Australia," Kogan's executive director David Shafter said.
"We are very happy to have reached another win-win partnership, enabling us to deliver great value and a variety of pet insurance products to our community."
This also marks the company's second attempt to enter the insurance market.
Kogan will also start selling health insurance under the banner Kogan Health, beginning in 2018 for the next three years.
This was the result of a deal it signed with Medibank last week, under which Kogan will also earn an undisclosed commission for each policy sold.

The Greens are using their parliamentary entitlements to try to improve their public image, spending $150,000 in taxpayer funds on media-monitoring service Meltwater.

Meltwater is a Norwegian company that promises to "grow and build brand" and "spark a genuine conversation that's on target", and is a rival to established Australian media-monitoring company Isentia, which is already available to all MPs.
Each of the nine Greens senators and one MP in Parliament contributed money for access to the Meltwater platform, according to analysis of the latest entitlements reporting from the Independent Parliamentary Expenses Authority.
A spokesperson for Greens leader Richard Di Natale described the expenditure as a "major upgrade to the Australian Greens' suite of media management and communications database software" that allowed their staff to work more efficiently.
Although the spending is within the broad entitlement rules, all MPs already receive media-monitoring services provided by Isentia, managed through Parliament.
Senator Di Natale's spokesperson described the media-monitoring service provided by Parliament as "limited and outdated, providing no transcripts or analytics, none of the online-only media outlets and no broadcast media clips in real time".
"In this 24-hour news cycle political news often breaks first online via social media and online outlets are just as important as print and radio, which is why we've opted for this service," he said.
"We don't have the staffing resources that the Liberal and Labor parties have, but this software allows us to quickly complete work that used to take our entire media team a full day to do."
Professor John Wanna, Sir John Bunting Chair of Public Administration at the Australian National University, questioned the value of politicians spending any extra money on media monitoring.
"If they're media monitoring they're looking in the rear vision mirror," he said.
"Where's the value in that? They should be setting the agenda, saying 'this is what we'll do, this is how we'll make Australia better, how we'll improve wellbeing'."
Australian Conservatives Party senator Cory Bernardi said the Greens "enjoy spending other people's money without regard to costs or benefits" and argued an "inability to manage public money" was a "disease" within the party.
Senator Di Natale's spokesperson said the spending represented "just 14 per cent of each MP's office budget" and allowed them to better manage media in "real time" as well as access a stable media database that all offices and staff could access.
"We see this spend as just as important as spending our printing and communications budget on office stationery and printer ink, if not more so," they said.
Professor Wanna said it was difficult for rule-makers to be prescriptive about what entitlements could and could not be used for, but also that "politicians play around with the flexibility enormously".
"When they're given a limited entitlement they see that as a formal entitlement to claim all that money," he said.
Senator Di Natale spent approximately $3,300 on software in 2015/16, compared to more than $25,000 in 2016/17 following the decision to purchase access to Meltwater.
Liberal MPs have recently been in the spotlight for similar spending, following revelations last year that much of their software expenditure was going to campaigning company — and Liberal donor — Parakeelia.
Forty-nine MPs declared expenditure on software for the period between April and June this year.
Former senator Malcolm Roberts and outgoing senator Sam Dastyari both billed around $3,000, while dozens more MPs on all sides of Parliament declared amounts between $900 and $2,500.
Recent clients include the Clean Energy Regulator, the Australian Building and Construction Commission and the ATO.

The Federal Government was forced to come up with a new plan for university funding because it couldn't get its original version through the Senate.
The plan announced today will save the Government $2.2 billion and is mostly based on changes that don't have to get through Parliament.
From next year, the money the Commonwealth pays to universities for students in bachelor courses will be capped at 2017 levels.
The freeze will stay in place for two years.
That means if universities want to accept more students into HELP or VET-funded positions, they'll have to figure out how to divide up the money they're already getting to accommodate any increased intake.
Yes, according to Universities Australia.
Catriona Jackson is the organisation's acting chief and she says it will be harder to get a university place from next year.
"Let's be absolutely clear a freeze is a cut and this is $2.2 billion worth of cuts to universities," she said.
"They are freezing funding for student places. If they are not funding a place it is very, very, very difficult for a university to offer a place, this is the way it's always been.
"This is a freeze on places, so if universities want to expand numbers — and a number of regional universities do want to because they're in an area of growing need for university degrees — then they will not be able to do that next year."
But the Government says it's all about being efficient and that universities have room in their budgets to increase enrolments if they want to.
Originally, the Government wanted to increase student fees from next year but that idea has now been dumped.
So, no fee increases.

The Government still wants students to pay back their loans sooner (once they start earning $45,000 a year).
That's higher than the original plan which was for repayments to kick in when income reached $42,000.
There will be a lifetime limit on how much students can borrow from the Government as part of their HELP or VET loans.
Those limits are:
Under the original plan New Zealanders were going to face higher fees for university in Australia because they wouldn't be allowed to access government subsidies.
That's no longer happening. So, the arrangements for New Zealanders stay the same.

Universities and new migrants are among those being targeted for savings to help the Government improve its budget position.
The Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook (MYEFO) shows this year's federal deficit has improved by $5.8 billion compared to forecasts in the May budget, but it is still going to hit more than $23 billion.

The savings measures include finding $2.1 billion by capping funds for universities.
The Senate has refused to pass the original higher education savings, outlined in the May budget, which aimed to cut $2.7 billion
To get around the Senate roadblock, the Government has tweaked its approach.
Students will be asked to start paying back their loans when they earn $45,000 a year — $10,000 less than the current threshold of $55,000.

MYEFO also has a two-year freeze on the Commonwealth Grants Scheme to universities and a cap on funding for student places.
That could force universities to put a limit on the number of places they offer prospective students.
Treasurer Scott Morrison said the freeze did not need to be approved by the Senate, but the new limit for paying back student loans and the lifetime limit both need Senate support.
A lifetime limit on student loans will also be imposed.
The maximum will be about $104,000 for most students and $150,000 for medical, dentistry and veterinary courses.
Labor's Treasury spokesman Chris Bowen called the higher education cuts an attack on one of the "sources of Australia's long-term prosperity".
Mr Bowen criticised the plan for hitting students from lower socio-economic backgrounds.
"The Labor Party in office opened the door to opportunity to thousands of Australians to attend university. Malcolm Turnbull appears intent on slamming the university door shut," he said.
The other big new savings measure in today's announcement is that new migrants will have to wait an extra year to be eligible for welfare.
The Government is factoring in a $1.2 billion saving by making new migrants wait three years for payments like family tax, parental leave and carers' allowance.
Mr Bowen said Labor had concerns about the change and would be examining it closely.
"We obviously are deeply concerned about any impacts on those who can least afford it," he said.
There is also a big crackdown on family daycare integrity, aimed at saving around $1 billion over the next four years, after a number of rorts in the sector.
The budget update revealed that the forecast for wage growth has been downgraded across the next four years and growth will also be slower.
But the Federal Government said it would still deliver lower deficits this year and every year through to the end of the 2020/21 financial year — the first year a surplus is forecast.
Labor attacked the Government's economic management, saying the $23.6 billion deficit was eight times worse than the $2.8 billion deficit in its 2014 budget.

When Jennifer Fletcher bought her luxury apartment in Melbourne, she never thought it would lead to a battle with one of the country's biggest building management companies.

Upon buying into the Tiara development at Melbourne's Southbank two years ago, she had to join Tiara's owners corporation and pay fees of $4,300 a year.
"I thought it would be simple. Everything would be looked after for me, but unfortunately that wasn't the case," she told 7.30.
The luxury apartment building proved to be anything but.
Problems in the building included graffiti, urine and bloodstains that weren't cleaned up, cracks in the plaster from level nine to level 30, fire escapes that didn't seal and firefighting equipment that didn't meet the code.
There was even an illegal dumpling restaurant operating out of one of the apartments.
Ms Fletcher discovered that all major services at Tiara were contracted to companies in the Network Pacific group, including Essential Services Compliance Pty Ltd and 24 Seven Maintenance Solutions.
With a number of those contracts set to expire, the Tiara owners committee — with Ms Fletcher at the helm — decided to appoint new contractors in their place.
Engineer Jason Kerr took over the maintenance contract and compiled a list of about 400 problems at Tiara that needed fixing.
He said some of the firefighting equipment at Tiara had not been checked in up to 18 months.
"Things like extinguishers, hose reels, things that fight fires in the building, they are there to protect the residents and the owners' assets, so there were deficiencies there," he said.
Network Pacific's managing director and chief executive officer, Stephen Briffa, said everything required under the contracts to service the Tiara building was done.
He rejects what Mr Kerr said he found at Tiara.
"That particular contract was for a three-year period, at the end of that contract every fire asset in that building was completely compliant," he told 7.30.
He also said Ms Fletcher's account of numerous problems in the building is simply wrong.


With the Tiara owners' committee determined to sign up new contractors, Network Pacific faced losing contracts worth nearly half a million dollars.
Then something curious happened. Network Pacific called a special owners' meeting.
Dozens of investor owners who live interstate or overseas were emailed by their property managers — Ray White Southbank — and an investment firm called Ironfish Real Estate.
Those emails sought investors' proxy votes.
Both companies told 7.30 they thought Network Pacific was doing a good job, they were concerned about the loss of its contracts, and they were acting in the best interests of their clients.
The emails sent by Ray White contained claims, initially made by Network Pacific, that Ms Fletcher was related to Mr Kerr, planting the idea that the Tiara committee had a conflict of interest in dumping its services.
Both Ms Fletcher and Mr Kerr said they are not related and the allegations made by Network Pacific are false.
"I thought it was incredible they were making such an assumption based on no information at all. They didn't even investigate any allegations," Mr Kerr said.
"And to be honest it was only being done, from my point of view, to discredit myself."
Stephen Briffa said Network Pacific had concerns about Tiara's new maintenance contractor, and had been told by another contractor that Ms Fletcher and Mr Kerr were related.
But he denied that spreading these claims had given investors the idea that there was a conflict of interest on the Tiara committee.
"Our concern was with the quality of the building management at that building by the building manager, and that's all we were interested in," he told 7.30.
In a statement, Ray White told 7.30 it had looked into the actions of a Ray White representative who attended the meeting, and found that he acted fairly and with integrity.
Ironfish Real Estate said it had received numerous complaints from its clients after National Pacific's contracts expired.

The proxy votes obtained by Ray White and Ironfish turned out to be decisive in reinstating Network Pacific's valuable contracts.
Network Pacific called an owners' meeting at its Melbourne office for Tuesday 11th October 2016, where Jennifer Fletcher, and other owners who opposed Network Pacific, were ultimately outvoted.
Using the sheer number of investor proxy votes, Ms Fletcher and other residential owners were voted off the Tiara owners' committee, and representatives of Network Pacific, Ray White and Ironfish were elected instead.
Then the meeting voted to reinstate Network Pacific companies as strata and building managers. In a final vote, its contracts were extended for three years.
Network Pacific says it at all times acted in the best interests of all property owners.
Stephen Briffa says the owners at Tiara each had an opportunity to find out for themselves what was happening.
"They investigated and they reached their own conclusions. Now, that conclusion happened to be the reengagement of the building manager," he said.
After the meeting, one Tiara owner challenged Network Pacific at the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal (VCAT).
But he lost, because in the eyes of the Tribunal, a large majority of owners had exercised their proxies in support of the company.
Put simply, the few owners at Tiara who were residents, rather than investors, had been outmanoeuvred and outvoted.
Despite their firsthand knowledge of the problems in their building, they had found it impossible to end their contracts with the Network Pacific group.

Zinc, a high-end development in Port Melbourne, is another apartment complex managed by Network Pacific.
One of the owners at Zinc, Megan Gourlay, said after Network Pacific signed on as a contractor, she and other owners encountered a series of problems — including a security system that repeatedly locked them out of their own building.
"We were paying for a service, and we didn't feel we were getting what we were paying for," Ms Gourlay told 730.
Zinc's owners' committee tried to end its contract with the property management company.
"They were not happy to entertain the idea of their services being terminated. They were not happy about it at all," she told 730.
As with Tiara, Network Pacific accused the residential owners at Zinc of having a conflict of interest.
Once again, it obtained proxies, and called a meeting of owners, in order to reinstate its own contracts.
Mr Briffa rejects the claim that the company responded to the prospect of losing the Zinc contract by attacking the integrity of the owners on the Zinc committee.
"We didn't do that," he said.
"We provided information to owners what our concerns were."

In the case of Zinc's owners, they eventually managed to send Network Pacific packing, but not before they faced extra legal charges.
And all the problems have caused Ms Gourlay to move out.
"It created a lot of stress on my fellow neighbours, who were on the committee," she said.
"And we don't want that in our lives."
For Ms Fletcher, the dealings have left her exhausted and frustrated.
"We're just devastated," she said.
"We haven't done anything wrong, we just wanted to live in our home.
"We don't know what to do and, yes, I have suffered and my family have suffered."

The Federal Government and consumer groups have slammed a "dud" voluntary and non-binding industry code that was intended to introduce greater transparency around life insurance premiums that are automatically packaged into superannuation.
The weakened and voluntary code may force the Federal Government's hand in regulating a sector that draws life insurance premiums from people's superannuation, often without the customer realising it.
Financial Services Minister Kelly O'Dwyer is considering "an appropriate regulatory response" after the voluntary code was slammed as being watered-down and unenforceable within hours of its release.
"The Government is concerned that the superannuation industry has walked away from a commitment to a more robust, mandatory code of practice that had been the subject of earlier consultation," Ms O'Dwyer said in a statement to the ABC.
"Australians should not be sacrificing their superannuation contributions and earnings for insurance they do not need or cannot claim on.
"The Government will consider an appropriate regulatory response in light of the industry's position."

The code released today by the Insurance In Superannuation Working Group (ISWG) claims to provide greater transparency and protection for super members, including simpler and clearer processes for members to opt out of automatic life insurance in their superannuation.
However, the code quickly sparked a backlash from consumer groups, after a year-long review into how the $2.3 billion sector manages insurance premiums within superannuation.
Choice policy advisor Xavier O'Halloran told the ABC that self-interest from insurers about potentially losing some of their revenue from premiums saw the code watered down from a harder draft code released earlier this year.
"It's a wasted effort. After a year of working with consumer groups and others, the industry has delivered a dud code," Mr O'Halloran said.
"It's unenforceable, it's stripped out a lot of the protections that were originally built into it.
"Once it became apparent that the effect on the bottom line of insurers was going to be significant, we saw industry back away from some of the more bold measures that were in the original draft code."
Government concerns and a potential consumer backlash come as large swathes of the financial services sector brace for a Royal Commission into bad and unethical behaviour in the banks and insurance companies.

A key objective of the voluntary code, according to the ISWG, is to ensure that automatic insurance in superannuation "is appropriate and affordable" and does not inappropriately erode retirement income.
Insurers are also required to communicate in "clear, timely and in plain language" when dealing with fund members about insurance in their superannuation.
The review was headed by insurance industry veteran Jim Minto, who maintains that, despite improved protections under the voluntary code, automatic life insurance in superannuation remains valuable for many Australians.
"It delivers enormous benefits without underwriting and must be preserved as a unique aspect of our superannuation system," Mr Minto said.
"This code helps automatic insurance function even better for members, as well as providing enhanced protections where members have decided to acquire 'opt in' life insurance cover through superannuation."
The Insurance in Superannuation Working Group (ISWG) was formed in November 2016 to review automatic insurance premiums within superannuation comprising the Australian Institute of Superannuation Trustees (AIST), the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia (ASFA), the Financial Services Council (FSC) and Industry Super Australia.
Earlier this year, Australian Super became the first major super fund to make insurance an "opt-in" for younger workers rather an an automatic inclusion.
The decision followed concerns put to the ISWG inquiry, which showed that an overload of unnecessary insurance within superannuation risks a "rapid erosion" of some retirement nest eggs.

Embattled Indian miner Adani says it will build and run Australia's biggest coal venture in central Queensland's Galilee Basin on its own after parting ways with mining services giant Downer.
Adani released a statement today revealing both parties had cancelled a conditional $2.6 billion contract as part of Adani's cost-cutting drive spurred on by the Queensland Government's veto of its $1 billion Commonwealth loan bid.
The split comes after Downer was the target of a nationwide activist campaign pressuring them to quit the Carmichael project in central Queensland.
The move raises further questions about the fate of the massive project, with Downer one of only two mine contractors — along with Thiess — considered capable of handling an operation producing up to 60 million tonnes of coal a year.
It is the latest in a long series of project hiccups for the Carmichael mine, including the veto of Adani's application for a Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility (NAIF) loan last week, and its so far unsuccessful attempts to raise finance in China.
Adani said in a statement it remained committed to the project and the split with Downer was "simply a change in management structure".

"Following on from the NAIF veto last week, and in line with its vision to achieve the lowest quartile cost of production by ensuring flexibility and efficiencies in the supply chain, Adani has decided to develop and operate the mine on an owner operator basis," the statement said.
"Adani and Downer have mutually agreed to cancel all Letter of Awards and Downer will provide transitional assistance until March 31, 2018.
"Adani remains committed to develop the Carmichael project and will ensure the highest level of standards and governance.
"This will not affect our commitment or the number of local jobs across Queensland.
"This is simply a change in management structure and ensures that the mine will ultimately be run out of our Adani Australia offices in Townsville."

The split, which Downer also announced via the Australian Stock Exchange, ends three years of negotiations between Adani and the mine contractor.

Downer has been operating mines for almost a century.
Adani had already shifted its deadline for financial close on the project from the end of 2017 to the end of March 2018.
The Galilee Blockade activist group had targeted Downer for a year, including by purchasing a large parcel of shares to confront management at its annual general meeting.
The group had also agitated among local councils in Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland to boycott Downer for road contracts over its role in the mine.
Galilee Blockade spokesman Ben Pennings hailed Downer's departure as "the biggest nail in the coffin for the Carmichael mine thus far".
He said it was a testament to "all the Australians who bought Downer shares, protested, blockaded and even got arrested to get Downer out of bed with Adani".
"Adani are unlikely to find another Australian company willing to risk building and operating such a controversial mine," Mr Pennings said.
"Adani have never operated a mine of this scale and have absolutely no experience operating mines in Australia — building Carmichael mine themselves would take years longer and significantly increase risks for investors."
Adani clinched most of its government approvals, including mining and environmental licences, as well as an Indigenous mine site access agreement that remains subject to a Federal Court challenge in March.
But with Adani having swept aside a series of legal challenges by conservation groups, financial close on the $22 billion project remained its main hurdle.
The company said it employed more than 800 people and had invested more than $3.3 billion in Queensland, saying it was "the biggest investment by an Indian company in Australia".
Just over $2 billion of that was to purchase the existing Abbot Point coal port at Bowen in north Queensland.

Flights have been delayed at the world's busiest airport after a partial power outage, leaving passengers stranded in dimly lit terminals or in aircraft idling on tarmacs.
The partial shutdown at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport forced the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to hold back flights bound for Atlanta.

Departures were delayed as well because equipment inside terminals was inoperative, the agency said, although the FAA flight control tower was operating normally.
The cause of the outage, which occurred just after 1:00pm (local time), was not immediately known, the airport said in a statement.
In response, United Air Lines, American Airlines and Southwest Airlines suspended operations to and from Hartsfield for the rest of the day.
"We know that today has been challenging to all of our customers traveling in and out of Atlanta, and we regret your disappointment," Southwest said in a statement.
The airport was working with Georgia Power to identify the problem and fix it. The utility had crews at the airport, spokesman John Kraft said.
Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed told reporters the airport was expected to be fully operational again by midnight.
Airports in Chicago were also affected, with dozens of Atlanta flights to and from O'Hare International Airport and Midway International Airport listed as cancelled heading into the evening.
Information posted on the website of the Chicago aviation department said 25 flights had been cancelled at O'Hare and 13 at Midway. It did not say if all those flights were cancelled because of what is happening in Atlanta.
On its website, Hartsfield-Jackson says it averages 275,000 passengers a day and, on average, almost 2,500 planes arrive and depart each day.
Photos posted on social media showed passengers sitting in partial darkness in one crowded terminal.
"Stuck on a plane at Atlanta Airport as the power is out there … bedlam inside and boredom out here!" Twitter user Jack Harris wrote.

Delta Air Lines said on Twitter it was working to allow customers to deplane as quickly as possible, with only a limited number of open gates available.
By 5:30pm (local time), 338 flights out of Hartsfield, or 32 per cent, were cancelled, and 238 were delayed, according to FlightAware, an airline tracking service.
For flights bound for the airport, 333, or 28 per cent, were cancelled and 284, or 23 per cent, were delayed.
Departure delays at Hartsfield were averaging about an hour and 40 minutes on Sunday afternoon, according to FlightAware.
In response to a question from a customer, the Atlanta-based carrier said it expected service to be restored by Sunday night (local time), although it cautioned that the airport had not yet identified the cause.
A Delta pilot told passengers a construction crew cut a power line, causing the outage, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported.
Delta officials could not be immediately reached for comment on the report.
But in a tweet, the airport wrote that this had not been confirmed.

International flights to Hartsfield were diverted to other Atlanta-area airports, US Customs and Border Protection said on Twitter.

It can often seem like news that makes us sad and angry is filling our lives and, more specifically, our Facebook feeds.
But is that really the case?
To find out, we analysed the reactions — the "loves", "hahas", "sads", "angry" and "wows" — to more than 150,000 Facebook posts from 11 of Australia's most popular online news outlets to see if we could make sense of what is making people tick (or ticked off) on Facebook.
That's more than 24 million emotional reactions since January 1, 2017. If you've reacted to a news story on Facebook in the past year, chances are we've tallied that up in these results.
The timeline below shows the most common reaction for the day, as well as the stories that provoked the biggest reactions over the year.


Aside from showing the sheer mass of content that organisations, like ABC News, 7 News, the Sydney Morning Herald, and others put on Facebook, the data gives us a few clues as to the most common reactions.
If anyone was counting, Anger was the most popular reaction on 169 of the 343 days captured in our data.
Sad came in second with 132 days, followed by Haha with just 20 days, then Love with 16 and Wow with four.
But overall, if you combine all the reactions to all the posts for the year, Sad was the biggest emotional reaction to news posts, followed by Angry, Haha, Love and, finally, Wow.
We've excluded Likes — all 40 million — because we wanted to find out what was making audiences go the extra step to express an emotion.


It's not hard to see why Sadness came out on top when you look at total reactions over the year.
Sadness generated seven of the top 10 biggest reactions in a day over the course of the year.
As you can see in the second chart below, the biggest day was January 23, in the wake of the Bourke Street car attack in the heart of Melbourne. There was an outpouring of emotion when the family of the youngest victim spoke of their loss.
We asked how the news in your Facebook feed made you feel. Read the discussion in the comments.


Many of the peaks in Sadness were driven by deaths of prominent people. You can see some of those peaks on September 8, with the death of cancer campaigner Connie Johnson; April 10, with satirist John Clarke's death; and May 8, with Soundgarden frontman Chris Cornell's death.
These huge reactions tie in with the way we know audiences respond to the deaths of celebrities.
"News about celebrities circulates as cultural texts that carry shared social experience and grief is a powerful personal experience that can have a collective social dimension," Glen Fuller, a co-author of the University of Canberra's 2017 Digital News Report, said.
What's interesting is that, according to Facebook's own data, Love is by far the most popular emotional reaction on the site. Love accounts for more than half of all Facebook emotional reactions since the reaction feature launched in early 2016.
To find out we looked at the keywords behind some of the most popular posts of each reaction.

The posts you found most upsetting largely appear driven by death and tragic events.
The word "died" was mentioned three times more than the next top keyword, "killed".
For Angry, "warning", "children" and "died" were all top words. But we also started to see divisive topics, such as same-sex marriage and Donald Trump fall under this emotion.
That's not the only place the US President pops up, Trump is the top keyword for the Haha reaction.
In fact, this is where we find many of our politicians, including Tony Abbott, Malcolm Turnbull and Pauline Hanson.
If we drill down even further, we see how key people or topics compare against the average post or even against each other.
Take our Prime Minister, for example. Audiences were 21 per cent more likely to laugh at a post about Malcolm Turnbull than at the average post.
There was 15 per cent more love for posts about same-sex marriage than the average.
And stories mentioning the Indian mining giant Adani triggered 46 per cent more anger than the average.
It's worth noting reactions aren't necessarily a direct reflection of how people feel about a subject. For example, one of the top posts mentioning Donald Trump was about Justin Trudeau welcoming refugees to Canada in the face of the US immigration ban on some Muslim-majority countries. That post got a lot of love — in contrast to most Donald Trump posts, which tended to provoke anger and laughter.
So how did Mr Turnbull stack up against Bill Shorten or Tony Abbott… or even against posts about cats?


Notes about the story

!!!@@@$$$

Overweight and self-conscious 31-year-old Leigh Aiple paid more than $35,000 for a plastic surgery package in Malaysia.

Less than 24 hours after he flew back to Melbourne, he was dead.
At the request of his grieving mother, Grace Westworth, a Victorian coroner investigated the care and treatment Mr Aiple received at the Beverly Wilshire Clinic in Kuala Lumpur, and found it fell well below Australian standards.
"I don't want anyone else to risk it," Ms Westworth told the ABC.
"It was totally dangerous. He was high-risk and they didn't stop."
Coroner Caitlin English found the case illustrated the need for people to be aware of the risks they are taking when they travel overseas for medical treatment.
"The Australian medical tourist will not necessarily be aware of the difference in standards of medical practice and management of patient care," she said.
New Zealand-based medical travel agency Gorgeous Getaways advertised the Malaysian clinic as "a boutique medical centre" with "highly skilled specialists".
Mr Aiple wanted the extreme makeover to be life-changing.
In 2014, he underwent two marathon surgeries at the clinic in the space of five days.
He had a 360 degree tummy tuck, extensive liposuction, an upper eye lift, a chin tuck, a thigh lift, chest sculpting and lip filler, with the first surgery alone lasting between 8-10 hours.
"He couldn't move, he couldn't stand or roll out of bed after the first surgery," Ms Westworth said.


In emails to his mother, Mr Aiple complained of being short of breath, a rapid heartbeat, and fainting spells.
"He told me he was vomiting and his heart was rapidly beating," Ms Westworth said.
Yet five days later, he was given the all clear to fly home after his wounds, which had burst open, were treated.
"He came off that plane in a wheelchair, I said: 'How are you Leigh?' He said: 'Horrid — I am in so much pain, I can't describe the pain'," she said.
"When I saw the gaping holes I couldn't believe what I was seeing. I could see inside."
Ms Westworth found her son collapsed in his bedroom the next morning. He died a short time later.

The president of the Australian Society of Plastic Surgeons and former head of plastic surgery at the Royal Melbourne Hospital, Professor Mark Ashton, reviewed the treatment and care Mr Aiple received in Malaysia for the coronial investigation.
He said the multiple surgeries Mr Aiple had would never have been performed in Australia, and the care he received afterwards was grossly inadequate.
The Coroner's report states Mr Aiple had several open wounds that were oozing fluid, and carers found him in pain in his hotel room, with his bedsheets covered in blood.
Professor Ashton told the coroner Mr Aiple would have been treated as a "high-risk" patient in Australia, not as a moderate risk as noted by the Malaysian surgeon, Dr Nasir Zahari, due to being 124 kilograms and morbidly obese.
The review also noted the level of anti-blood clotting treatment administrated was below Australia's recommended levels.
Mr Aiple died after suffering deep vein thrombosis (DVT), when a blood clot moved from his legs to his lung. DVT is often associated with flying.
However, Professor Ashton noted the autopsy showed the clots had occurred weeks before his plane trip, while he was at the clinic.
It is estimated 15,000 Australians each year travel overseas for cosmetic and dental work.

The drawcard for most is the cost of overseas surgery is cheap. Mr Aiple paid an estimated third of what it would have cost him in Australia.
"The obvious question how much is your life worth. Leigh was only 31 and he is dead," Professor Ashton said.
Professor Ashton said there was no regulation of medical tourism, with bundle packages designed for patients to have maximum surgeries in the shortest period of time, irrespective of risk.
"Having surgery overseas comes with significant risk as it comes with no guarantee as to the standard of care you will receive," Professor Ashton said.
He said there was no such thing as international standards, despite what was advertised.
"You are taking a bet. There is no such thing as an international standard," Professor Ashton said.
"When you go to these clinics they all look professional and when you try to research the standard of care and the level of expertise they have it's very difficult to find out."

He said surgeries were often done "sight unseen", as in Mr Aiple's case, where he only had one consultation with the surgeon five days before his surgery.
In Australia, a surgeon would require up to four pre-surgery consultations.
Emily Hart, a medical negligence lawyer with Maurice Blackburn, said other people contemplating cosmetic surgery overseas could learn from Mr Aiple's death.
"The standards in Malaysia were met in this case, but they come nowhere near the standards here in Australia," Ms Hart said.
"These companies are putting profit over patient safety."
Professor Ashton said patients who had endured "botched" operations returned to Australia to have fix-ups, often at the expense of the public purse.
"We see three or four a month in Melbourne, but in Perth and Brisbane it's more," Professor Ashton said.
In a recent case a 19-year-old lost a breast and a nipple after having botched surgery overseas.
The coroner has recommended Victoria's Chief Health Officer publish a health advisory warning medical tourism patients that overseas standards of care can differ to medical care in Australia.
International manager with Gorgeous Getaways Paula Vernon said the doctors and facilities the company partners with are of world class standard.
"The doctors and facilities that we work with are amongst the top for each of the countries (sic)," she told the ABC.
"Meeting, and in some cases, exceeding international standards."
The company still partners with the Beverly Wilshire Clinic in Kuala Lumper and noted that the BMWC won International Medical Travel Journal Awards in 2015 and 2016.
"In all honesty, I've experienced medical standards in both Australia and Malaysia, where I underwent several big body procedures, and I have to say that hand on heart I did, and will continue to, actively select Elective Cosmetic Surgery in Malaysia," Ms Vernon said.
The surgeon who treated Mr Aiple, Dr Nasir Zahari, said that while he has not seen the coroner's review of the treatment the 31 year old received, staff at the Beverly Wilshire Medical Centre gave Mr Aiple the best medical and surgical care.
Dr Zahari said Mr Aiple was given a full explanation prior to surgery with regards to procedures, post-operative care and the possible risks and complications.
"Necessary steps to prevent and minimise possible risks had been taken including the prevention of Deep Vein Thrombosis," Dr Nasir said.

The big switch is on in the mortgage market.

In just the past six months the amount of interest-only (IO) loans held by the banks have dropped by around $36 billion, according the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority.
APRA can feel pretty chuffed with the result. It is exactly what it wanted in its push to de-risk banks' balance sheet by quelling the speculative bravado of investors.
But there are obvious side effects in targeting interest-only loans.
They are the instrument of choice for not only investors biding their time in the tax haven provided by negative gearing to make a windfall gain on capital appreciation.
They are also used by maxed-out borrowers repaying as little as possible, hoping for a bit of financial headroom if wages pick up.
Unfortunately wages show no sign of picking up.
As the 19th century Prussian Field Marshall Helmuth Graf von Moltke once noted, "No battle plan survives first contact with the enemy", and APRA's insurgency has the IO brigade scampering in retreat.
It is a retreat that will further cripple the spending power of cash-strapped households and has profound implications for the Australian economy, according to the big Swiss investment bank, UBS.
Already household wealth built up by years of rising house prices shows signs of peaking as the market cools.
At the same time savings are being eroded just to pay for the essentials — such as utility bills and mortgages — leaving many households at a financial breaking point.

So far the switch from IO to principal and interest (P&I) has been small, but momentum is building.
"We estimate that the additional household cash-flow hit from switching to P&I was only around $1-$2 billion, or just 0.1-0.2 per cent of total household sector income," UBS chief economist George Tharanou said.
However, Mr Tharanou said there is likely to be a notable and increasingly negative impact over time.
"Those individuals switching from IO to P&I do face a material 'shock' with scheduled mortgage repayments jumping — effectively overnight — by 35-to-50 per cent," he said.
For those with little or no headroom at the moment, a 50 per cent jump in repayments may simply be impossible to finance.

On figures put together by the UBS banking analysts, the potential expiry of IO loans in coming years will surge up to more than $100 billion in the 2018 financial year.
Assuming the typical five-year maturity and no rollover to another IO term, almost $140 billion of IO loans will have wound up by 2019, a figure which jumps to $153 billion in 2020.

A survey by UBS of borrowers found that the majority under financial stress from higher interest rates would cut consumption, while a significant share would sell their property.
But that might be just the start, as "Phase 3" of APRA's macroprudential tightening may well start next year.
Phase 1 put a speed limit on the Big Four banks investment lending, capping growth at below 10 per cent a year.
Earlier this year Phase 2 was enforced limiting IO loans to 30 per cent of new residential mortgage loans.
Before that tightening, IO loans accounted for up to 40 per cent of the banks' mortgage portfolios, which APRA noted at the time was "quite high" by international and historical standards.
Phase 3 is expected to zero-in on the net income surplus (NIS) — or a lender's assessment of surplus income borrowers have left over after living expenses, debt repayments as well as some "pocket money" — as well as loan-to-income valuations.

APRA's concern is that many new borrowers have very little surplus income to deal with souring conditions, including higher interest rate charges.
The APRA survey found almost 20 per cent of new loans were made to borrowers with a NIS of less than $200 a month, while 3 per cent of lending had nothing left over, or in fact had a "negative" NIS.
"For now, household cash flow in 2017 has been crunched down to a record low of only around 1.5 per cent year-on-year," Mr Tharanou said.
"In addition to weak wages income, there has also been significant drags on household cash flow from the combination of higher taxes — mainly via 'bracket creep' of higher average tax rates — as well as a surge in both utilities and petrol, almost entirely driven by higher prices rather than volumes."
Mr Tharanou noted that despite households struggling to pay their bills, no additional RBA rate cuts meant a smaller fall in interest payments compared with prior years.
The overall picture is fairly bleak with a collapsing saving rate unlikely to fund household consumption much longer.
"So unless there is a surprisingly strong surge in wages, or a further drop in inflation, then real consumer spending will likely slow ahead," Mr Tharanou argued.
"But we continue to worry that if the RBA hikes too much and, or too early, they risk turning an orderly housing correction/soft landing — as appears to be unfolding at the moment — into a housing collapse."
And that would be a whole step up in the level of household pain.
Unemployment would most probably rise, as would bad debts and perhaps foreclosures.
As Mr Tharanou noted that could potentially lead to "a self-reinforcing negative feedback loop between asset prices and the real economy".
And that would not be pretty.

Electricity prices are set to fall across the country over the next two years, offsetting this year's price increase.

The Australian Energy Market Commission said the price drop will happen as variable wind and solar generation comes online, which is paid for by the Government's Renewable Energy Target.
Nationally, prices rose almost 11 per cent this year, but with the extra supply from wind and solar, the commission predicts that will be offset by a 12 per cent fall over the following two years.
The AEMC's annual report on price trends provides an overall picture of factors driving electricity prices for households in each state and territory.
AEMC chairman John Pierce said this year's report showed wholesale electricity costs were now the single biggest driver of change in residential electricity bills, unlike earlier price trends reports which found network costs were the main driver.
"Prices rose sharply this year by almost 11 per cent on a national basis as consumers felt the impact of Hazelwood and Northern coal-fired plants retiring and the lack of replacement investment, combined with high gas prices," Mr Pierce said.
"But we expect these price rises will be reversed over the next two years as wind and solar generation enters the system."

The report also found that over time, low wholesale prices contributed to the closure of coal-fired plants.
"Without investment in replacement dispatchable capacity, wholesale prices will go up again and remain volatile," Mr Pierce said.
"And the rollercoaster will be repeated."
The AEMC also warned of instability and blackouts if the new systems were not managed efficiently.
The commission said the price fall will begin from mid-2018.

The mid-year budget update will show Australia's gross debt will be $23 billion lower by the end of the 2020-21 financial year, compared to the forecasts in the May budget.
Treasurer Scott Morrison will unveil the latest budget data in Canberra on Monday.
The updated figures could give more room to accommodate income tax cuts, which have been foreshadowed but not detailed by Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull.
Gross debt was slated to hit $606 billion by the 2020-21 financial year.
Instead, it will now be $23 billion less — forecast at $583 billion.
The Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook (MYEFO) is also expected to provide more detail on the Government's plans to claw back $2 billion from the university sector.
Key to that effort will be a proposal to cap the number of university student places.
The Senate blocked Education Minister Simon Birmingham's original plan earlier in the year, which included a proposal to introduce higher student fees and make graduates pay back their loans sooner.
Labor has, unsurprisingly, already been predicting and criticising Monday's update — saying any cuts to the university sector and continued focus on company tax cuts will show the Coalition is "out of touch".

Gavin Myers runs a seafood export business at Port Lincoln on SA's west coast. He has customers in Australia, and around the world, eagerly awaiting his wares.
Guess who gets their dinner first?
"The people in Singapore get their product before anyone in Sydney will," Mr Myers said.
"That's because we are using predominantly road transport within Australia ... but the Singapore guys are getting to it within 36 hours of most of the goods coming out of the water in Lincoln."
That somewhat surprising fact speaks to two things — firstly, the vast distances in this country, and the transport cost structure faced by primary producers in regional Australia.
And secondly, the importance of relatively inexpensive, reliable international flights out of Adelaide.

Without those planes, Mr Myers said he'd lose 30 per cent of his business.
"We wouldn't be dealing with too many of our exports clients at all," he said.
"The direct flight out of Adelaide is certainly the secret to getting produce out of this region," he said.
Most of the attention surrounding new carriers is what it means for tourists, both incoming and outbound.
The SA Government recently touted that over the past six years, there had been a 67 per cent increase in the number of international seats.
But while bums on seats are important, the CEO of Adelaide Airport, Brenton Cox, said it's what's beneath those bottoms that's been crucial for high quality perishable exports: lots of cargo space.
"It wasn't that long ago that 30 to 40 per cent of our exports had to make the long haul on a truck to Sydney or Melbourne, predominantly to then go out to reach our international markets," Mr Cox said.
"Now we've got farmers in Victoria sending their produce for export out of Adelaide.
"Twenty per cent of the profit of an airline on those passenger services comes from freight."
But while it's first class, and clear skies, for exporters targeting the Middle East and north Asian markets, companies that rely on the US are stuck in economy.
That's because there's no direct flight from Adelaide to any destination in the US.

Yet for manufacturers like Tom Spurling, the US is a business lifeline.
"It is fundamental. Our business here in Adelaide would not exist without the United States market," Mr Spurling said.
In a year that's been defined by the loss of Holden, Mr Spurling is keen for people to remember that "we still make stuff here".
As one of life's curious asides, Mr Spurling's father, Graham, once ran Mitsubishi Australia — back in the days when the company made Magnas and money.
Manufacturing is, so to speak, the family business.

Mr Spurling's company makes ophthalmic lasers, which are used to treat eye diseases such as glaucoma.
Every time the company sends either its products or people to the US, it faces extra time and cost.
"Not having a direct route adds a day or two to everything," Mr Spurling said.
"Whenever you do anything with a bunch of people involved, and you're adding Adelaide and Sydney and Los Angeles, you end up with complexity and risk of it not happening.
"We have had stuff go missing — not often, but it is a very painful process.
"So long as it's sustainable, so long as there's a good business case for the carrier, it would be fantastic, just fantastic to have a direct service."

Whether a direct Adelaide-US flight is on any airline's radar isn't clear. But it's certainly a priority for Mr Cox.
"Historically Adelaide has been quite strong with medical exports, but it has to go out of the eastern ports," he said.
"The real opportunity we need in this state is a direct US carrier, not just for people to come here and visit, but to create that direct channel for exporters."

First, the good news. Gerard Minack, one of the most astute, if bearish, of market strategists has significantly dialled down his odds of an Australian recession next year.

The bad news?
"Australia seems set for another year of desultory growth, avoiding a statistical recession but experiencing per capita pain," Mr Minack said.
However, that is positively upbeat compared to his half-year report card on the Australian economy.
"Six months ago I was very gloomy about the outlook for Australia in 2018," he said.

"My base case was weak growth, but I saw a one-in-three chance of recession, and almost no upside risk."
Mr Minack said the recession risk was now, "probably no higher than 20 per cent".
Mr Minack made his name as one of Wall Street's leading strategists with the big investment bank Morgan Stanley, before setting up shop in Sydney with his own eponymous, boutique advisory business, Minack Advisors.
He famously predicted Wall Street and ASX were well primed to halve in value well before the GFC broke in late 2007.
Mr Minack argued on one hand a fading housing sector and weak wages remained headwinds to the economy, while improved corporate sentiment may mean things turn out better than expected.
"But the most likely outcome is unchanged monetary policy, moderate Australian dollar declines and domestic equities continuing to lag global markets," he said.

The negatives:
The positives:
The wildcard for the recession scenario is a steeper-than-expected fall in house prices.
"The big, double-barrelled uncertainty, however, is wealth effects: both, how far house prices fall, and how any fall will affect household saving," Mr Minack said.
"I expect single-digit house price declines next year but it's not clear how such a wealth setback will affect saving.
"Recession is not my base case, but is a risk if there is an out-sized consumer reaction to falling house prices," he said.
The other buffer against a shrinking economy is Australia's solid population growth.
"It's difficult to have a statistical recession when population growth is running at 1.5-to-1.75 per cent — even if trend-per-capita income growth is weaker now than the period that included the 1990s recession."

Just how much things have turned around since Mr Minack's gloomier view six months ago is likely to be reflected in the Federal Government's Mid-Year Fiscal and Economic Outlook (MYEFO).
The punditry suggests the deficit should narrow from the $29.4 billion forecast in the May budget to around $26 billion.
The improvement can be attributed to a generally stronger-than-expected global economy driving stronger commodity prices and a windfall from corporate tax receipts, while better-than-forecast unemployment results should keep a lid on welfare payments.
Operating in the opposite direction are slower wage growth and consumption dragging treasury revenues down.
A roughly 10 per cent narrowing in the projected deficit this year should provide a platform for Treasurer Scott Morrison to remain upbeat in his promise to deliver a surplus, or at least a balanced budget, by 2021.

UBS chief economist George Tharanou said the strongest starting point suggests the cumulative deficits — over the forecast profile of the four years to 2020/21 — could also be better by around $10 billion.
Mr Tharanou is not so bullish on Mr Morrison's plans to slash government debt.
"However, for total public sector gross debt we don't expect as much improvement," Mr Tharanou said.
NAB's Ivan Colhoun said the Government's policy priority remains to negotiate through the Senate the company tax cuts.
Those cuts are intended to help businesses with more than $50 million a year in annual turnover, but Mr Colhoun said there is increasing political pressure to announce some modest income tax cuts ahead of the next election as well.
Mr Morrison may look at a fiscal window opening and cut and run, but that will be for another day.
For the markets, with little in it to suggest a downgrade from the credit rating agencies, MYEFO may well be a bit of one-day wonder.
"Bottom line, budgets rarely have a significant impact on Australian markets," Mr Colhoun said. He could have added, MYEFOs even less so.
However, if Wall Street's close is anything to go by, markets certainly take notice of big tax changes.

All three key indices climbed to fresh records on indications that while the Republicans may not be totally unified, there were enough votes to get the tax bill over the line next week.
ASX trading over the weekend was buoyed by this and looks set for a sprightly opening session.
If everything goes to plan for Mr Trump, his tax bill will clear the House on Tuesday and the Senate on Wednesday.
Waiting in the congressional wings is the prospect of a partial government shutdown just before Christmas as the Government hits its spending limits.
A deal authorising another $US700 billion in defence spending is expected, otherwise it will be a less-than-merry Christmas for US public servants.
Wall Street is unlikely to be too concerned as, perhaps oddly, traders tend to turn a blind eye to US administrations running out of money.
Friday's surge kicked US share prices almost 1 per cent higher over the week, while the ASX was relatively flat. Europe and Japan had poor weeks, both down around 1 per cent, while China slipped 0.6 per cent.
Oil hung near a two-year high, but sentiment is weaker with forecasts from the International Energy Agency that a step up in US shale oil production could push the market back into surplus, just as the glut was starting to drain.
The spot price of iron slipped a bit, although futures contracts edged up on news that steel stockpiles were now at the their lowest level since 2011.
However, the feeling is the good times for steel may be over once the winter production cuts are lifted, prices may slip once again.
The data front is fairly quiet leading up to Christmas.
Indeed, there is now not much macro-fodder to ruminate on until well into January.
In the US there is bundle of housing figures, GDP and a key inflation measure, while Europe's attention is likely to be captured by the Catalan election (Thursday) where the separatist parties are just ahead in the opinion polls.
The RBA minutes (Tuesday) will tell us nothing we don't already know. As the RBA's former boss Glenn Stevens would advise, everyone should chill and head to the beach for summer.

Standing up to the forces of the Southern Ocean for 82 years finally took its toll on the Esperance timber jetty on a Saturday afternoon in September this year.
About 1:30pm picnickers heard an almighty crash and turned around to see a six-metre stretch of the jetty had disappeared, the wood left floating in the ocean.
The 512-metre Esperance timber jetty is just one of three that remain in Western Australia, along with Carnavon's One Mile Jetty and the refurbished Busselton Jetty, which stretches almost two kilometres into Geographe Bay.
For many, the partial collapse was the final death knell for the jetty in a saga that has stretched years and divided the community.

The Esperance community is split — the shire wants to replace it with something more durable where ongoing costs do not become a drain on ratepayers.
"We don't want any other council in the future to be going through what this council and this community is going through," Esperance Shire President Victoria Brown said.
"Because it has, it's driven a massive wedge in there."
But Friends of the Esperance Tanker Jetty Chairman Tony Bright said the timber structure could be restored and its history retained, without being a burden on ratepayers.
"Our research has shown that the methods and the cost of materials and the people who would be involved in doing it would lead to a much more reasonable result than what was previously projected," he said.
The Shire believes those claims don't stack up.

Carnarvon Heritage Group has the licence for the One Mile Jetty and estimates a full restoration, including a functioning rail line, would cost up to $40 million.
The Group's Chairman Tom Day conceded they would need a financial white knight to see that full restoration.
"We'll probably never run the train again, but we're looking at a walk — and fishing — only structure," Mr Day said.
The Busselton community fought to save its 152-year-old jetty and in 2009 they won.
But it cost $27 million for the initial works and has an ongoing maintenance bill of $800,000 each year.
Busselton Jetty Chief Executive Officer Lisa Shreeve said they had managed to turn a profit, carving out a position in the tourism landscape as the longest timber jetty in the southern hemisphere and home to one of the world's five
underwater observatories.
"The Busselton Jetty has about 470,000 visitors a year," Ms Shreeve said.
"Without the jetty there would be 110 fewer jobs in Busselton and $10 million is indirectly injected into the economy from the jetty."
She had some advice for communities trying to retain their timber jetties.
"They need to work out a business case, will whatever they do make money?" Ms Shreeve said.
"What's their competitive advantage, what can they do that can add to what's already there and grow on that competitive advantage."
Further complicating matters, the Western Australian Government has slapped a conservation order on the Esperance jetty.
That means any renovation must retain the heritage value and "tell the story" of the structure.
How exactly that is reflected in construction is still not quite known.
The Shire is in the process of obtaining the services of a heritage architect to help them meet that stipulation.
The Friends of the Esperance Tanker jetty are also pinning their hopes on the Heritage Council intervention.
For many in the community they just want to cast a line in the deep waters of Esperance Bay.
"Eventually you will have a recreational fishing jetty," Mrs Brown assured them.
But it'll be beach fishing for some time yet.

What is claimed to be the world's first fully solar-powered train is operating on the New South Wales North Coast.
A refurbished 70-year-old 'red rattler' is running on a three-kilometre stretch of disused rail line at the popular tourist destination of Byron Bay.
It made its maiden trip yesterday with almost 100 passengers on board.
The $4-million project is the brainchild of multi-millionaire businessman Brian Flannery, who owns a resort in the area.
"Hopefully it attracts people to Byron Bay," Mr Flannery said.
"I think international tourists will come here to have a look at this world's first solar train.
"So let's see, in five years' time they'll probably still say I'm mad, but it's a bit of fun."
Tim Elderton, from the Lithgow Railway Workshop, was tasked with building curved solar panels and a battery system to power the train.
"Basically it's electric bus technology that we've re-engineered to adapt to a train," he said.
"Of course the major difference is it's got solar panels on the roof so it can recharge itself.
"For those cloudy days we've also got 30 kilowatts of solar panels in this [station's] roof here so we can also plug it in.
"On a sunny day like today we can do about four or five trips before we have to plug it in."
It has been 13 years since a train has run on the disused track between Casino and Murwillumbah.
The New South Wales Government closed the North Coast line in 2004, citing low passenger numbers.
But the Byron Bay Railroad Company's Jeremy Holmes said the alternative lifestyle haven was an ideal place for a project that combined modern solar technology with the old-world charm of a heritage train.
"I think everyone knows that Byron's very conscious about anything to do with the environment," he said.
"It's really nice to be able to run a train that's zero emissions and powered by the sun."
But it might be premature to call this the dawn of an new era in rail travel.
Longer trips than this one — 10 minutes to cover three kilometres or so — would require regular recharging stations along the route, but Mr Flannery said the technology might be suited to inner-city trams.

"A lot of the tram networks of course have overhead wires and they're electric but they're powered off the grid from overhead," he said.
"But in a case where you want to build a tramline without that infrastructure, I think you could.
"At various stations you could top the train [or tram] up."

Canadian police are investigating the mysterious deaths of Barry Sherman, founder of Canadian pharmaceutical firm Apotex Inc, and his wife Honey, one of the nation's wealthiest couples whose bodies were found in their mansion.
Police said they learned of the deaths after responding to a midday (local time) medical call at the Sherman's home in an affluent section of north-east Toronto.
Two bodies covered in blankets were removed from the home and loaded into an unmarked van on Friday evening.
"The circumstances of their death appear suspicious and we are treating it that way," Constable David Hopkinson said.
Homicide detectives later told reporters gathered outside the home that there were no signs of forced entry.
Their neighbours, business associates and some of Canada's most powerful politicians, including Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, said they were saddened by the deaths.

Toronto Mayor John Tory said in statement he was "shocked and heartbroken" to learn of the deaths, noting that the couple had made extensive contributions to the city.
"I hope that investigation will be able to provide answers for all of us who are mourning this tremendous loss," Mr Tory said.
The Shermans recently listed their home for sale for nearly $C7 million ($7.1 million). A real estate agent discovered the bodies in the basement while preparing for an open house, the Toronto Globe and Mail reported, citing a relative.
Mr Sherman, 75, founded privately held Apotex in 1974, growing it by introducing large numbers of low-cost generic drugs that took market share from branded pharmaceuticals.
He stepped down as chief executive in 2012 but remained executive chairman. Forbes has estimated his fortune at $US3.2 billion.
Apotex is the world's seventh-largest generic drugmaker with 11,000 employees and annual sales of more than $C2 billion in more than 45 countries, according to its website.
The couple was known for their philanthropy, giving tens of millions of dollars to hospitals, universities and Jewish organisations, CBC reported.
"They were extremely successful in business, but also very, very giving people," former Ontario Premier Bob Rae told CBC.
"It's going to be a very, very big loss."

Commuters who use Claisebrook and McIver train stations in East Perth are today getting a taste of the inconvenience that is to come once Perth Stadium opens.
A full-scale simulation of the stadium's transport systems will see the stations closed, as will be the case every time there is an AFL game or large concert at the venue.
In order to get people to and from the stadium quickly, trains will not stop at Claisebrook or McIver stations with commuters instead offered much slower replacement buses or the choice to walk.
For the many staff and patients at Royal Perth Hospital who use nearby McIver Station every day, a journey home using public transport will now include the one kilometre walk to Perth Station.
Moore Street in East Perth will also be closed during events to avoid frustrating drivers as the extra trains will see the level-crossing rarely open.

The tests have been deliberately timed to coincide with several major events in Perth today — including Symphony in the City, a Wildcats game and an Ashes test to ensure conditions are as realistic as possible for train and bus operations.
"It will make sure we refine all our processes and get our ducks in a row for the opening of the stadium proper when things really start to happen," Public Transport Authority spokesman David Hynes said.
With limited parking around the stadium the Government hoped 80 per cent of people would use public transport to get to and from events.
Mr Hynes said that in order to get 28,000 fans out of the venue within an hour of an event finishing there was no time for trains to stop at Claisebrook or McIver.
This would disrupt a number of services on the Thornlie, Midland and Armadale lines.
"It will be something of an inconvenience for people but the complexity of having to run so many trains through those stations and mix them up with timetable services means for operational purposes we'll just bypass those stations," he said.
"It's designed to minimise the impact and maximise efficiency, we have to strike the balance between those two things."

Mr Hynes explained most events would be held at times when the stations were scarcely used.
However, he said Friday night football and weekday concerts could affect thousands of people who take trains from McIver or Claisebrook to get home from work.
"The way the AFL schedules games on Friday and Thursday evenings in Perth to suit television audiences in the eastern states, starting around 6:00pm, does not suit us because we are still trying to look after our core duty, which is getting people to and from work," he said.
"The great majority of events will be either in the evenings or in the weekends when the pressure on Claisebrook, McIver and Moore Street Level crossing are at their lowest."
He said today's test will see if the plan is actually viable and if there could be room to run limited train services to the stations during events.
Mr Hynes said logistics had been complicated by delays in building the Swan River pedestrian footbridge, which he said was a vital cog in transport plans for the stadium with up to 14,000 fans expected to use it during AFL games.
The Government asked the AFL not to schedule any Friday night matches in Perth until March, when they expect the footbridge to be completed and extra buses would be used to compensate for it during events in the meantime.
Hundreds of staff will take part in today's test, which will replicate as close to reality as possible an ordinary event in order to identify any faults in the system.
"We will have security, customer service staff and other staff in place and recreate conditions as much as we can to test all aspects of our operations and make sure they're top notch for the start of play as it were," Mr Hynes said.

Land "rarer than hen's teeth" might be part of an auctioneer's spiel, but the lack of available property to develop in Hobart saw hundreds of bidders at an auction in the eastern shore suburb of Bellerive.
Nine blocks of Crown land all sold under the hammer for between $375,000 and $501,000 on Saturday.

Real estate Greg Gottschalk said the auction crowd was unprecedented in Tasmania.
"I have never seen an auction that size in Tasmania before," he said.
"This is the best auction I have seen in 30 years of selling real estate."
Auctioneer Jerome Thiessen said land in Bellerive was "rarer than hen's teeth".
"The market is on fire in Hobart at the moment, we have got the most exciting real estate market in the country," he said.
"This is probably the biggest auction I have done.
"This is super rare. To have flat land near the water, it just does not come up. As rare as it gets.
"We were expecting good results, the vendor will be very pleased, perhaps a little higher than we thought, which is great."

Real Estate Institute of Tasmania president Tony Collidge said the state's real estate market was unlike anything he had seen before.
"I have been doing real estate for 26 years and I have never seen a market like this, where there is such a shortage of stock," he said.
"We believe we are somewhere between 3,000 and 5,000 properties short in the Hobart market place.
"It has just been an explosion. This year we look like breaking the record for the highest amount of value of property sold in Tasmania ever.
"It will be the best result that we have had in 10 years for the number of sales."

He said councils had a responsibility to help developers.
"We have 48 major commercial projects in the city sitting there on the drawing boards about to happen and councils are sitting there twiddling their fingers," he said.
"The system should be much more streamlined so that things can happen."

Building a $14 million solar farm is an expensive way to send a message about electricity prices, but Doug and Lyn Scouller said they were left with few options.
In Normanton, 500 kilometres north of Mount Isa in north-west Queensland, the Scoullers built a solar farm big enough to power an area almost twice the size of Tasmania, in a move to prove to stakeholders the benefit of positioning power generation sites at the end of the grid.
"We suffer from an unusual amount of blackouts out here. Sometimes I've experienced it in Karumba up to 13 times a day ... and it's purely because of the losses," Mr Scouller said.
"The power actually comes from Rockhampton up the coast to Townsville and up to us, and it's the old story the longer the extension lead, the less power you get at the end."
The five-megawatt, 16,000-panel farm produces electricity that is fed back into the grid at Normanton.
By producing power locally, Mr Scouller said he believed he would save on the losses, and subsequently put a downward pressure on electricity prices.
"I just believe we've got a lot of losses in the network and if we start to produce power where the power is used, we will reduce those networks and it will ease the pressure on increasing power prices," he said.


In 2016, the Normanton Solar Farm received an $8.5 million grant from The Australian Renewable Energy Agency (AREA), and is now being used as a test case to generate data about fringe-of-grid energy investment.
Calculations made before the plants construction will be compared with new data to determine whether the Scouller's planned reduction in transmission loss will eventuate.
But not everybody is convinced.

Greg Elkins, the Ergon Energy engineer who led the commissioning, said his preliminary research showed that end-of-line power generation might increase the transmission loss.
"The requirement of very long transmission lines means that there are a lot of losses in just having the line turned on," Mr Elkins said.
"Putting energy at the remote end can actually cause that amount of [required] power flow to have the line online ... to increase.
"It's kind of like a freight train - the amount of energy required to take the freight train from Townsville to Normanton is travelling every minute, and whether the power is supplied in Normanton or Townsville, that freight train still needs to run every time."
While there are plans for expansion, the Normanton Solar Farm does not yet have a battery system. Another reason why Mr Elkins said he believed changes in transmission loss would be limited.
"Most of the generation from the solar farm is during the day where consumers typically use it during the night, so the excess solar generation has to flow back to Townsville — that's one of the reasons why the losses will be minimal," he said.
Mr Elkins said the only way to remove the losses entirely would be to turn off the Townsville to Normanton line, which he said might cause more problems.
"The only way to remove those losses would be to turn that line off which would then produce more unreliable power," he said.

Despite the difference in opinion, the Scoullers are adamant their business will work, even if it does take eight years to secure a return.
"[I'm] extremely confident — we did a lot of pre-planning, a lot of calculations, a lot of engineers — no doubt at all," Mrs Scouller said.
Mr Scouller agreed.
"It's just pure mathematics and physics — if you generate out of here, you reduce those losses almost to zero," Mr Scouller said.
The project bought no shortage of challenges.
In February, a stand-off with Ergon Energy delayed the switch-on of the farm, and about the same time Mr Scouller was diagnosed with cancer.
But at the weekend the couple hosted the ultimate celebration, and were married on the same day the farm was fully commissioned.
"We had family travelling from all over, so we wanted to celebrate with a bang," Mr Scouller laughed.
And the newlyweds said Normanton would not be their last solar farm.
"I think it's a bit like a marathon runner — you forget how hard you were hurting halfway through the race. Once you're finished, you want to have another go," Mr Scouller said.

The European Union has agreed to move Brexit talks with the UK onto a second phase focused on trade and a transition pact, but some leaders cautioned that the final year of divorce negotiations before Britain's exit could be fraught with peril.
EU leaders, who had offered British Prime Minister Theresa May a rare summit round of applause over dinner in Brussels the night before, took just 10 minutes to agree that she had made "sufficient progress" on divorce terms last week and to give negotiators a mandate to move on to the main phase of talks.
"This is an important step on the road to delivering the smooth and orderly Brexit that people voted for in June of last year," Mrs May said outside her home in Berkshire, southern England.
"There is still more to do but we're well on the road to delivering a Brexit that will make Britain prosperous, strong and secure."
The UK Prime Minister reassured her party's ardent Brexit supporters that departure is certain on March 29, 2019.
The head of the EU executive, Jean-Claude Juncker, cast her as a "tough, smart, polite and friendly negotiator," a polite nod to a woman facing ferocious and complex pressures at home, whose downfall Brussels fears would complicate talks further.

Summit chair Donald Tusk said the world's biggest trading bloc would start "exploratory contacts" with Britain on what London wants in a future trade relationship, as well as starting discussions on the immediate post-Brexit transition.
A transition period is crucial for investors and businesses who fear that a "cliff-edge" Brexit would disrupt trade flows and sow chaos through financial markets.
While there was a "sigh of relief" at the summit table that Brexit talks can move forward, EU leaders said talks on a future free trade pact would not begin until after March.
This was a date underlined by "guidelines" that set out how to proceed as Britain seeks to unravel more than 40 years of membership.
"We have made good progress, the second phase of talks can start," German Chancellor Angela Merkel said.
"But this will mean even tougher work — that was clear today in the discussion — than we have experienced so far."

When the cost of manufacturing a surfboard in Australia became too high to compete with factories overseas, many independent workshops simply closed their doors.
But in coastal towns across regional Australia, a growing demand for locally made surfboards is helping board shapers bounce back in the face of a flood of imported products.
In Denmark, in WA's Great Southern region, Ben Rufus has launched his own business after he began making boards for himself and a few mates.
Eight years later his handmade boards — complete with striking art work — are in high demand.
"The problem was the [imported] boards were bad shapes. People would buy them to save money, but they weren't any good," Mr Rufus said.
"I didn't expect to be able to make surfboards for a living, I didn't think there would be a future in it."

Surfboard manufacturers across Australia are tailoring their services towards a niche market of surfers in their local towns and beaches.
Many workshops that continue to survive have had to downsize and relocate to regional towns with strong cultures of surfing.
"They come because people want good service and high quality work," Albany surf shop owner Adrian Shepard said.
"People come to me because they want a custom board, they want to do something specific on a wave. They're not walking into a shop and grabbing something generic off the wall."

When it comes to the ebb and flow of surfing trends on the west coast of Australia, Wayne Winchester has seen it all.
He was once one of Perth's sought-after board makers and has been making, collecting and restoring surfboards for more than 40 years.
Like many others, he turned his back on the industry amid the slump and relocated to the beaches of southern Western Australia to practise his craft alongside a smaller band of surfers.
"In the early 1970s, surfers were loyal to certain shapers. I had my surfers who would get all their boards from me, and there were others up and down the coast in WA, who had their loyal band of surfers as well," Mr Winchester said.
Competition from factories overseas spelled doom for Australian surfboard manufacturing, but it would not be the end.

Mr Winchester remains as passionate about the art and science of making a surfboard as he has ever been.
For him, the revival of the local surfboard making industry in regional WA is the latest chapter in the rich history of surfboard design.
From the early surfboards of western Polynesia more than 3,000 years ago to the legend of Hawaiian Duke Kahanamoku and the interventions of Tom Blake, the surfboard of the 20th century evolved into a streamlined piece of wave riding technology following centuries of experimentation.
But it was during the 1960s that the art and science of surfboard making underwent its most dramatic shift.
"The mid 1960s to the early 1970s was called the transitional-psychedelic era of surfboard design," Mr Winchester said.
"Basically, there was a massive revolution in what surfboards looked like. They went from being 10 feet long to less than 6 feet long in a very short space of time."

The shorter boards were easier to manoeuvre and change direction on waves, as surfers demanded more performance-orientated boards.
"Surfers were just doing very radical things and the design of the surfboard allowed them to do it," Mr Winchester said.
Next came the addition of leg ropes, three-fin thrusters, and the rise of competition surfing.
By the early 2000s, the use of computer technology and weighted boards became so sophisticated that intrepid surfers could be towed into monster waves of serious consequence.
But competition from mass produced, imported surfboards forced many independent manufacturers in Australia out of business.
"The surfboard was rapidly becoming a commodity and the soul of surfing seemed destined to end," Mr Winchester said.

Today, visitors to the many beaches along WA's south coast can see a kaleidoscope of surfboard shapes, designs and artwork, many of them handcrafted by local board makers.
For Wayne Winchester the story of surfboard design evolution, a story that seemed doomed over a decade ago, now promises a bright future.
"What we see in the current era, is almost a return to the bohemian lifestyle of surfing. It was all about the journey, it wasn't necessarily just about the act of riding the wave," he said.
"It was about how you got there, and doing stuff with your mates, looking at designs and colours of boards — that whole bohemian lifestyle of travel and freedom."
It is that trinity between the surf, surfboard and surfer that Mr Winchester says is at the heart of the changing fortunes of Australia's independent surfboard production industry.
"The feel and the lines of a surfboard as you run your hands down the rail, is just a beautiful thing. You actually feel the flow of the board and how it will fit in the water," he said.
"I know they're inanimate objects, but they've got a soul".

Rupert Murdoch has called sexual misconduct allegations within Fox News "nonsense" and "largely political".
Speaking to Sky News after Disney struck a deal to buy 21st Century Fox, Mr Murdoch said there had been no sexual misconduct allegations at Fox News since chief executive Roger Ailes left in 2016, despite two high profile Fox News hosts being ousted this year.
When asked how the allegations had harmed Fox News, Mr Murdoch said it was "all nonsense".
"There was a problem with our chief executive [Roger Ailes], sort of, over the years, isolated incidents," he said.
"As soon as we investigated it he was out of the place in hours, well, three or four days.
"And there's been nothing else since then. That was largely political because we're conservative.
"Now of course the liberals are going down the drain — NBC is in deep trouble. CBS, their stars.
"I mean there are really bad cases and people should be moved aside. There are other things which probably amount to a bit of flirting."
Several high-profile men at Fox News have faced sexual misconduct accusations within the last two years, including Mr Ailes.

Fox News reportedly paid $US20 million in damages to a former anchor who alleges she was fired after refusing to have sex with Mr Ailes.
Former anchor Gretchen Carlson filed suit against Mr Ailes in July 2016, alleging he took her off a popular show and cut her pay because she refused to have a sexual relationship with him.
Mr Ailes always denied the allegations, but left Fox less than three weeks after the suit was filed, taking a $US40 million ($52 million) severance package.
Mr Ailes said Ms Carlson's suit was in retaliation for the network's decision not to renew her contract after disappointing ratings for her show.
Fox cut ties with news host Bill O'Reilly in April, after the firebrand conservative host was accused of sexually harassing multiple women.
And fellow host Eric Bolling left the network in September after he was accused of texting photos of his genitals to female staff members.
In recent months, sexual harassment claims have plagued other US networks, ones Mr Murdoch referred to as "the liberals".
In November, NBC fired Today host Matt Lauer just a week after CBS fired Charlie Rose over sexual misconduct allegations.

A remote island off Tasmania's north-west coast could become one of the largest wind farms in the Southern Hemisphere, but only if Tasmania gets a second Bass Strait power interconnector.
The Australian arm of UPC Renewables, an American company, has set up 110-metre-high wind monitoring towers to gather data on where to place the turbines.
It has entered into an agreement with the island's private landowners to build a wind farm on their property.

UPC Renewables Australia plans to build as many as 300 turbines on the island and nearby Jims Plains, which is on the Tasmanian mainland.
The $850 million project will generate about 450 megawatts, making it the largest of its kind in the state.
At full capacity they could generate enough energy for 250,000 homes, more homes than there are in Tasmania.
"We have a world-class wind resource here which means when we install our power we'll be making power at what we believe will be a very low cost to everyday Australians," UPC Renewables Australia CEO Anton Rohner said.
UPC said its long-term goal was to get approval to develop a second Bass Strait interconnector, enabling the company to double the size of the project.
At 1,000 megawatts, it would produce enough power for half a million homes — or nearly the size of the city of Adelaide.
"The wind farm we're proposing is going to be, we believe, one of the largest in the southern hemispheres if not Australia," Mr Rohner said.
Building a second interconnector requires regulatory approval which could push back the prospect of such an expansion of the farm well into the next decade.
Energy Minister Guy Barnett said he hoped the second interconnector received approval.
"The second interconnector will be essential to maximising the investment of up to $1.6 billion here in Tasmania to make this work and work to its capacity," he said.

In November, the State Government committed $20 million on a business case study into developing a second interconnector.
The results of that study are not expected for at least a year.
Concerns have been raised about the potential costs of building an interconnector.
UPC Renewables has said it would fund the building of such an interconnector through third party private investment if it was granted approval.
The existing undersea cable failed in 2016, which when combined with low dam levels, cause an energy crisis in the state and sparked a parliamentary inquiry.
Robbins Island is synonymous with Wagyu beef cattle, which cross the saltwater gap that separates the patch of earth from mainland Tasmania.
The 10,000 hectare island is owned by the Hammond family, who have been cattle farming for four generations.
John Hammond said the towers brought the family's 17-year dream of having a wind farm on their land one step closer, and that a nearby project near Woolnorth inspired them.
"Seventeen years ago we were watching what was happening at Woolnorth when Hydro Tasmania started to put the first turbines in there," he said.

"We realised the same wind that blows over that wind farm blows over this island.
"We see this as another way to farm, and another way to diversify, another way to sort of help keep the property in the next generation.
"This project will probably help us keep the island in the family for next four or five generations."
UPC Renewables said it expected the first wind turbine to be built and ready on the island in about two years, and that the entire site would be operational around 2023.

South Australia's Spring Gully Foods has cleared its multi-million-dollar debt, with the help of the public, after entering voluntary administration four and a half years ago.
The brand, known for its pickled onions and chutneys, today dispatched its final cheques to creditors, paying them 102 cents in the dollar as a gesture of goodwill.
The family-owned company entered voluntary administration in April 2013, after a downturn in sales left them with debts of close to $5 million.
The announcement prompted a huge community response, with South Australians buying the products in bulk and the brand entirely selling out of stock in the state.
Spring Gully managing director Kevin Webb, who is the third generation of his family to run the business, said it was an "overwhelming time".
"We are still humbled by what happened, we never thought the people would buy out South Australia in 24 hours," he said.
"All I can do is say thank you."

Supervisor Maria Dente has worked at Spring Gully for 30 years, and said she was relieved to still have a job at the company.
"It's not just a job, the company is fantastic to work for, the bosses are awesome," she said.
"We are very appreciative, and thank the public for all their support."

Mr Webb said the company has emerged tougher and more innovative.
He said putting a "strong advisory board" in place was crucial to the turnaround.
"Obviously in some of my own private moments I may have felt this is impossible, but we have had the support of our families, and our business and our advisory [board]," he said.
During the process he said the company had struggled through a honey drought but had managed to keep "roughly" the same number of staff, which now sits at 45.
The company is looking to hire a dozen more people over the next five years, as it renews its ageing plant and releases 13 new lines of pickled vegetables, chutneys and sauces.

President Donald Trump has thanked his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin for remarks he made  "acknowledging America's strong economic performance", the White House says.
The two presidents spoke by phone following Mr Putin's annual press conference in Moscow, where Mr Putin was asked to assess Mr Trump's first year in office.
He said Mr Trump had made "some fairly serious achievements", pointing specifically to the sharp rise in US stock markets.
"I'm not the one to evaluate the President's work. That needs to be done by the voters, the American people," Mr Putin said.
"[But] we are objectively seeing that there have been some major accomplishments, even in the short time he has been working.
"Look at how the markets have grown. This speaks to investors' trust in the American economy.
"This indicates the confidence of investors in the American economy. This indicates they have confidence in what President Trump is doing in this sphere.
"With all due respect to those in opposition to President Trump in the United States, these are objective factors."
The White House said Mr Trump spoke with Mr Putin by phone, and thanked him "for acknowledging America's strong economic performance in his annual press conference".
The Kremlin made a point of noting that Mr Trump initiated the call.

In his press conference Mr Putin accused those investigating potential collusion between Russia and Mr Trump's 2016 presidential campaign of damaging the US political situation, "incapacitating the President and showing a lack of respect to voters who cast their ballots for him".
Mr Putin dismissed those allegations and the idea of a Russia connection as "fabricated".
"What did someone see that was egregious about this? Why does it all have to take on some tint of spymania?" he said.
"All of it was invented by people who oppose President Trump to undermine his legitimacy."
During their call, Mr Trump and Mr Putin also discussed ways to work together to address North Korea's nuclear and ballistic weapons program, the White House said.
Mr Putin had earlier warned the US against using force against North Korea.
He emphasised that Russia opposes Pyongyang's nuclear bid, but added the US had "provoked" Pyongyang into developing its nuclear and missile programs by spiking a 2005 deal under which North Korea agreed to halt them.
Mr Trump has repeatedly said all options remain on the table.

Students at Wirrabara Primary School will today be dismissed for the final time as it prepares for closure after 138 years, leaving the town without a school.
Amid nostalgic reflections and celebration, there has been a growing sense of unease about what the closure of the school might mean for the town's future.
Teagan Hollitt, 8, is one of the only 11 students left at the school in the tiny town in South Australia's mid north.
Her ancestor Josiah Hollitt opened the school at its current site in 1921, and she is disappointed that the school board had voted to close it down.
"I feel very cross because the parents who voted yes to close it down [did so] because they didn't have enough money to pay for the school to be open," Teagan said.
The remaining students will have to go to other schools in Laura and Booleroo Centre — both a 20 kilometre bus journey away.
"I haven't been here very long, but I've made quite a bit of friends and I'm sad because I like this school. I don't want it to close," said another remaining student, Crispin Harness.

Teacher Jayne Mainprize Potter came from England to begin her career in education at Wirrabara.
Her career took her to other schools, but she returned this year to take up the principal's job and oversee the school's closure.
"I'm quite sad in the sense that I had really good memories of the school when I taught here in 2005," she said.
"So to see the numbers decline to the stage where the school is going to close is pretty sad."
Ms Mainprize Potter said the closure would be felt by the whole community.

"I think the students have realised that because of the numbers it was inevitable," she said.
"They have been really sad, but they also are quite pleased at going to the new schools and making new friends. So it's sort of a bittersweet experience."
For former students like Kevin Sizer, there are plenty of memories left behind.
"The proximity of the church to the cricket pitch on the oval was such that there were some lads capable of heaving a ball through the church window, which was one of the targets," he said.
Mr Sizer said the school's closure dealt a serious blow to a town still recovering from the 2014 Bangor bushfires.
"It's just another nail in the coffin of a small country town," he said.
"We are a declining population, we are an ageing population, [we] struggle to encourage young people to stay, young families to move in.
"If you haven't got a school it's just going to make it a whole lot more difficult."
Across town, convenience store and post office owner Vicki Morley said business owners were trying their best to remain positive.

"It's never good for a school to close, but it's progress unfortunately. There are just not enough students to keep the school open," Ms Morley said.
"However, the parents still have to bring the students in to catch the bus to whichever school they're going to, so I don't think it's going to impact on us a great deal."
The State Government said it was working with the local tourism and development group to allow use of the community garden and kitchen at the site until it is sold.
Wirrabara locals said they would like to see a new caravan park or movie theatre built using the old school facilities.
But any future plans will depend on how much money can be raised for the projects, and who buys the site.
"They've been very proactive in trying to work out what to do with the school, you know the main thing is the students don't suffer," Ms Morley said.

Optus has been taken to court for allegedly misleading and pressuring 20,000 of its customers to sign up to the National Broadband Network (NBN) — sooner than they were required to.
The Australian Competition & Consumer Commission (ACCC) commenced proceedings against the telco in the Federal Court on Friday.
The regulator claimed that Optus told these customers that the NBN was coming into their area, and existing internet plans — delivered through its Hybrid Fibre Coaxial (HFC) network — would be disconnected.
But the timeframes the telco quoted to their customers were sooner than what was contractually allowed to cancel their services.
Optus even told customers their services would be disconnected in as little as 30 days, the ACCC said.
"This is particularly concerning as Optus received a significant financial payment from NBN Co for each customer that moved from its cable network to the NBN," ACCC chairman Rod Sims said.
The regulator said this conduct occurred during an 18-month period between October 2015 and March 2017.
However, that is not the only complaint the ACCC has against Optus.
It also alleged Optus misled customers, between October 2015 and September 2016, into thinking they could not sign up to NBN services from its competitors.
"Optus created the impression that its customers were required to obtain NBN services from Optus, when they could have chosen to switch to any internet service provider," Mr Sims said.
"We are also concerned that Optus cut off some of its customers' internet services when it had no contractual right to do so.
"Telephone and internet are essential utilities and it is unacceptable for Optus to treat its customers this way."
In response to these allegations, an Optus spokesperson said the company was "working cooperatively" with the regulator.
"The ACCC’s action today relates to past processes that we have successfully addressed."
"We also compensated customers who had been disconnected without sufficient notice."
This is the second time this week that the telco has been in trouble with the ACCC.
On Monday, Optus admitted that it misled more than 8,700 customers about the speed of their NBN plans, and agreed to compensate them.

You've probably heard the hype about bitcoin or ethereum, but what about cryptocurrencies like neo, dash or ripple?

From next year, Coinbase — one of the world's biggest cryptocurrency exchanges — has announced that a swathe of new altcoins will be added to its platform.
It has come as welcome news for Australian investors who, until now, have been paying a premium on local exchanges.
The interest in bitcoin has exploded as much as its price, with one bitcoin now worth $25,000 and Australians cannot get enough.
Coinbase currently lists three of the world's most popular coins: bitcoin, litecoin and ethereum.
There are thousands of cryptocurrencies available — almost everyone has heard of bitcoin and ethereum — altcoins are all of those other currencies.
"[Altcoins] actually often have a lot more functionality, but also they're a lot more specific," said Professor Jason Potts from RMIT University.
The Australian peer-to-peer blockchain-based energy trading platform Power Ledger is a good example of what altcoins are.
Buyers and sellers are able to trade renewable energy, dispensing with the need of a middleperson.

"If you want to trade energy peer to peer you use a particular token for that," Professor Potts said.
While there are Australian exchanges that sell altcoins, they charge a premium price.
So Australian investors who want a better price often have to sign up to a US-exchange and learn how to trade coins like shares.
But now, with Coinbase's decision, investing will become accessible to anyone with a credit card and a phone.
"What it does is it makes it easier to access a wider variety of crypto assets, in the sense that you're not just constrained to the big two or three — like litecoin, ethereum and bitcoin," Professor Potts said.
"You've now got the same level of access to a much wider range of these."
While Coinbase has yet to announce which currencies they will be adding, Professor Potts said the result would likely see more Australian cash flowing into the cryptocurrency world.
"It will happen everywhere and I think we can just see this as a reallocation of Australian households investment portfolios," he said.

Alex Saunders made so much money in cryptocurrencies that he decided to quit his job to work full time as an investor.
But he also helps other investors through his Youtube channel Nugget's News Australia, which is dedicated to answering cryptocurrency questions.

Mr Saunders said at any time of the day or night, he has someone asking him about bitcoin.
"I'm getting tagged in hundreds of things a day now, and messages to my Facebook, comments on YouTube, questions left right and centre," he said.
And he said Australian investors were excited about Coinbase's announcement.
"For the average investor that's not too tech savvy, downloading that app on their phone is just going to be such an easy way to get into these new coins," he said.
"Rather than having to sign up with different websites and manage more passwords and having the stress of all those different options to get your head around."

A gloomy night in overseas stock trading is likely to flow towards the Australian share market today.
Investor sentiment stumbled over potential roadblocks to the Republicans' tax overhaul.
This was despite Congressional Republicans reaching a deal on the final form of the tax bill on Wednesday.

Republican Senators Marco Rubio and Mike Lee said they do not support the bill in its current form.
Mr Rubio told reporters that if the bill's proposed tax refunds related to the child tax credit is not expanded: "I'm a no...It has to be higher than $1,100."
The child tax credit in the US tax code is meant to lower the tax bills of working families with children.
Mr Lee's spokesman, Conn Carroll, said in an interview with Reuters that the senator is now "undecided on the tax bill as currently written".
Equity investors are concerned that stocks could tumble if the bill, which includes slashing corporate taxes, fails.
However, some of the best performing stocks on the S&P were 21st Century Fox and Disney.
Fox's share price jumped by 5.8 per cent after Disney struck a deal to buy the film and TV businesses of Rupert Murdoch's media empire for $68 billion ($US52.4 billion) in stock.
This deal would strengthen Disney's plans to create its own streaming service, potentially making it an even bigger threat to Netflix.
Disney shares rose by 2.7 per cent following this development.
The lift in the two media giants' stock values made consumer cyclicals the best performing S&P sector (+0.3pc).
The only other sector to post gains was technology, which rose by a tepid 0.04 per cent.
The Australian dollar has continued to surge, and has lifted by 0.5 per cent to 76.7 US cents.
It has also lifted against the British pound (+0.4pc), euro (+0.8pc), Japanese yen (+0.2pc) and New Zealand dollar (+1pc).
The local currency lifted ahead of the Federal Reserve's decision to lift US interest rates, and continued to soar following Thursday's stronger-than-expected job figures from the ABS.
Overnight, the Australian dollar was particularly strong against European currencies.
The Bank of England and European Central Bank held their respective policy meetings overnight, and decided to keep interest rates on hold.
However, the ECB sent mixed signals — pledging to keep printing more money for as long as necessary, yet upgrading its economic growth forecasts.
The ECB now expects the eurozone's economy to grow 2.4 per cent this year, but admitted it would not hit its inflation target by 2020.

Melbourne-based developer Pelligra Group has been revealed as the buyer of the Holden plant in Adelaide's north, but the site is expected to remain mostly vacant to commercial development for another 18 months.
Holden would not reveal the sale price but said the Elizabeth site would be renamed the Lionsgate Business Park in a nod to the carmaker's emblematic red lion.
Weeks before the last car rolled off the production line in October, Holden indicated it had found a buyer but refused to say who it was.
But the carmaker now said Pelligra was committed to turning the site into a hub for "industrial, manufacturing, construction engineering, automotive and commercial uses".
"Our wish for the future of the site has always been that it continues to create jobs for Elizabeth and the surrounding area," Holden facilities director Matthew Goodwins said in a statement.
"We believe that Pelligra's master plan for the site is positioned to achieve this."
The site will not be formally handed over to Pelligra until after decommissioning, which is expected to continue until mid-2019.
"[Holden] will remain in control of the site until that process is completed," the carmaker said.
It will also continue with a site contamination assessment, which began after chemical contamination of groundwater was discovered in 2011.
SA Premier Jay Weatherill said the sale would create hundreds of jobs.
"Mr Pelligra and his company are planning to spend hundreds of millions of dollars in developing the site, creating many hundreds of jobs, so this is fantastic news for the northern suburbs, indeed for the whole of SA," he said.

Family-run Pelligra was established in 1960 and describes itself as a third-generation company with a property portfolio including industrial and residential projects.
"South Australia has an exciting future before it, based on its major role in the defence industry; its significant mining and resources portfolio; its strength in food and agriculture; its geographically central location; advanced renewable energy position and its affordability," chairman Ross Pelligra said.
"We see enormous potential in the Holden site based on partnering with businesses operating in these sectors but also in keeping the site's automotive heritage alive through the development of a cluster of complimentary industries which tap into the significant residual skills of former Holden workers."

Holden said that even after the site changes hands it would remain as a tenant to store spare parts and also wants to establish a museum at the site commemorating its automotive heritage.
Diesel generators temporarily installed as part of a State Government energy plan are only occupying a relatively small area, Holden said, and will be transferred to a new home to create a new back-up power station.

Disney is buying a large part of the Murdoch family's 21st Century Fox in a $68 billion ($US52.4 billion) deal, including film and television studios, cable and international TV businesses as it tries to meet competition from technology companies in the entertainment business.

Before the buyout, 21st Century Fox will separate the Fox Broadcasting network and stations, Fox News Channel, Fox Business Network, FS1, FS2 and Big Ten Network into a newly listed company that will be spun off to its shareholders.
Fox assets that will be sold to Disney, include the Twentieth Century Fox movie and cable networks.
Fox currently owns the rights to the X-Men and the Fantastic Four and has mixed success with both.
Under the mega-merger, Marvel (which is owned by Disney) will gain back the rights to two of its biggest properties from the comic books.

Disney will also assume about $18 billion ($US13.7 billion) of net debt of 21st Century Fox.
Disney Chief Executive Bob Iger, 66, will extend his tenure through the end of 2021 to oversee the integration of the Fox businesses.
He has already postponed his retirement from Disney three times. In March, he said he was committed to leaving the company in July 2019.
Mr Iger said he would work with Fox CEO James Murdoch on integrating the two companies, but he did not know what Mr Murdoch's role would be over the long term.
After integrating the companies, he said he would "continue to discuss with him whether there's a role for him here or not".
Rupert Murdoch said selling much of the 21st Century Fox entertainment businesses to Disney allowed what remained of his family's business to focus on American news and sports.
During a call with investors on Thursday, Mr Murdoch described the move as a return to the company's lean and aggressive roots.
Mr Murdoch, calling himself a "newsman with a competitive spirit", said Fox was "probably the strongest brand in all of television" and had not been hurt by losing some of its stars.
He said the new company would focus on live news and sports brands and the strength of the Fox network.
"I know a lot of you are wondering, 'Why did the Murdochs come to such a momentous decision?'" he said.
"Are we retreating? Absolutely not. We are pivoting at a pivotal moment."

James Murdoch is the son of Rupert Murdoch, who built 21st Century Fox and News Corp out of an inheritance from his father in Australia.
Rupert Murdoch has ostensibly already handed the reins over to a new generation at Fox.
His son James is CEO, while his other son, Lachlan, like Rupert, has the title of executive chairman.
The entertainment business is going through big changes with tech companies building video divisions and advertisers following consumer attention to the internet.
Disney is launching new streaming services, which could be helped with the addition of the Fox assets.
Having its own services will allow Disney to bypass the likes of Netflix and charge consumers directly for access to its massive content library.

Ride-booking will become available in the Northern Territory early in the new year, after Hi Oscar secured approval from the Government.
The Perth-based company said it expected to have drivers on the road in Darwin and Alice Springs from February 1.
It comes after lengthy debate in the Territory, which ultimately saw rival company Uber abandon plans to set up shop, citing restrictive government regulations.
Hi Oscar founder Daniel Broughton said his company could meet the NT's requirements.
"Myself and the team behind me, we've worked really hard for a number of months at this," he said.
"To have it finally become a reality, we're super excited."

Minister for Infrastructure, Planning and Logistics Nicole Manison said the advent of ride-booking would bring the Territory in line with the rest of the country.
"We are are delivering on our promise to bring ride-sharing to the Territory," she said.
"For the public, our ride-sharing regulations provide Territorians with an additional safe and convenient transport option.
"For jobseekers or those wishing to supplement their income, ride-sharing is a great option to make some extra cash."
She said reduced taxi license fees taking effect from the start of February would help the industry remain competitive.
Hi Oscar drivers will have to apply for approval from the NT Government and pass police and medical checks.
The drivers will pay about $600 in license and insurance fees in the Territory, which Uber said would deter would-be ride-bookers.
But long-term taxi driver Les Whittaker said the cost did not compare to overheads for commercial operators.
"They're going to reduce [a Darwin taxi license] from $20,000 to $5,000 when ride-sharing comes in but it's still $5,000 that ride-share drivers don't have to pay," he said.
"And also they're going to bring in a $1 levy for every taxi fare and every ride-share trip, which the customer is going to have to pay.
"That's their way of recouping the money that they're losing from the license fees."
Hi Oscar's app is not able to process payments from Basics cards, which would prevent some people on income management from using the service.
"We need to implement that functionality," Mr Broughton said.
"It is something he envisage being able to accommodate in the future."
He said there were 23 drivers currently going through the registration process in Darwin and Alice Springs, two of whom are female.
Hi Oscar promotes the option of selecting a woman driver as an added safety consideration for female passengers.
The company said it hoped to have between 40 and 50 drivers registered by the time of launch in February.

Developers of a $20 million eco-tourism development on the Tasman Peninsula say the time is right to proceed, more than a decade after the idea was first floated.
The Remarkable Lodge at Crescent Bay received approval in 2008, but developer entrepreneur Dick Smith later shelved the project because of community opposition and a lack of State Government support.
He sold it to his daughter and son-in-law Hayley and James Baillie last year.
Mr Baillie said the 20-suite boutique accommodation would create more than 30 jobs.
"Tasmania has changed in terms of a destination considerably and so has the whole luxury lodge market," he said.
"It has been a long journey for us.
"If we go back in time luxury lodges really didn't exist in Australia and yet now they're probably the hottest part of the tourism sector."
The State Government has committed $1 million toward the project.
Premier Will Hodgman said the money was for infrastructure upgrades to get the project up and running.
"It will be contribution to the roadway, to water, sewerage infrastructure, for power," he said.
"We're prepared to back this exciting vision.
"It will add another jewel in the crown that is Tasmania's tourism industry."
Tasman Council Mayor Roseanne Heyward said it was exciting to see the project, which has council approval, move forward.
"It will be something that people can come to the region and find work or school leavers and young people to actually stay home if they want to and get work," she said.

Cr Heyward said State Government support had helped to revive the development.
"I think it has tipped James and Hayley Baillie over the line and it has just been the impetus they require to keep going," she said.
Mr and Mrs Baillie already run three luxury lodges across the country.
"It's full steam ahead from here," Mr Baillie said.
"The project is fully approved and we're now moving forward with fine tuning of the interior elements.
"We have had quite a lot of opposition in other places that we've developed.
"But I think we very much look forward to proving those people wrong and really showcasing what will be a sensitive development."

The car dealing industry needs an overhaul, the competition watchdog says, following its investigation into what it calls "systemic problems".

The Australian Competition & Consumer Commission (ACCC) released the findings of its 18-month investigation today, and said car manufacturers had a lot to answer for.
Its concerns included honouring warranties, accuracy around fuel consumption, and lack of information provided to independent repairers in order for them to do their job.
"In the past, these complaints have been raised. There's been a voluntary code. Our judgement is the voluntary code just has not worked," ACCC chairman Rod Sims said.
"In some categories, some manufacturers are better than others but then they fall down in other categories. But these are systemic problems."
Dishonest or inaccurate fuel-consumption and fuel-emission information was also highlighted in the investigation's findings.
"It can vary from 50 per cent for some vehicles or 5 per cent for others so consumers can't even rely on the relative fuel economy performance from the lab tests," Mr Sims said.
"They could be buying a car thinking it has low fuel economy when in fact it doesn't."
Mr Sims said the ACCC also found some manufacturers imposed unnecessarily complex warranty claim processes, often leading to car dealerships footing the bill.
"It is an issue we will be pursuing with governments, and we're very hopeful we can get change," he said.
George Moraitis runs an independent repair shop in Sydney's eastern suburbs, where over the past two years he has seen four local garages go out of business.
He attributes this to car manufacturers deliberately withholding technical information about their cars.

"Whether it's Holden, Ford, Toyota, they all withhold information," Mr Moraitis said.
"Obviously the dealers and manufacturers … want to keep the work in house.
"They don't want to release it to the after market. It's just their business strategy."
Mr Moraitis said he was frustrated all repair businesses in America and Europe were given the information, while the Australian industry was left in the dark.
"We need to follow the European or American model, where an independent workshop pays an annual fee and they get the same access to the same information and programming facilities that a dealer would," he said.
The ACCC report recommended the creation of a compulsory system for manufacturers to share such information with repairers.
"Now is the time for some form of regulation or legislation," Mr Sims said.
But Tony Weber, chief executive of the Federal Chamber of Automobile Industries, was dismissive of the ACCC's findings.
"I think after 18 months [the ACCC] still don't clearly understand the nuances of the automotive industry," Mr Weber said.
"I think this report's all predicated on a low level of concerns amongst consumers.
"There are 1.2 million cars sold in this country every year, and our understanding is there is an extremely low level of concern about those sales."

Westpac has committed to pay a total of $11 million in compensation to customers who held one of 13,000 owner-occupier, interest-only home loans affected by a mortgage processing error.
The error led to those customers continuing to make interest-only repayments on their loans, instead of being switched to principal and interest repayments at the end of their interest-only period.
The bank said the mistake predominantly affects loans with an interest-only period that expired between 2009 and 2016.
Westpac said it will start contacting affected owner-occupier customers from today and it expects the remediation process will take about 12 months to complete.
In a statement to the Australian Securities Exchange, Westpac revealed it notified the corporate regulator, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC), when the error was identified and worked closely with it on how to respond to the mistake.
The bank said loans through its subsidiaries — St George, Bank of Melbourne, Bank SA and RAMS — are not affected.
Westpac has apologised for the glitch.
"We want our customers to have confidence that if we get something wrong, we acknowledge it and put it right," the bank's chief executive of consumer banking, George Frazis, said.
"We apologise unreservedly for the error and have now automated the switching process to ensure it does not happen again.
"Importantly, customers don't need to do anything. We are contacting customers proactively and will provide compensation to anyone who we believe has been financially disadvantaged."
Accounting firm Deloitte has been engaged to assess Westpac's approach.
The bank has established a dedicated customer service line for customers with any queries on 1300 132 925.

South Australia's headline unemployment rate has risen above 6 per cent for the first time since July, despite the creation of 2,000 additional jobs in November.
The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate rose from 5.8 pre cent to 6.1 pre cent on the back of a sizable increase in the number of people looking for work.
Only Western Australia recorded a higher seasonally adjusted unemployment rate.
But on more stable trend figures, South Australia remained amid the pack with an unchanged unemployment rate of 5.8 pre cent — equal to Queensland, and marginally higher than Victoria.
Despite the closure of Adelaide's car industry in October, growth in full-time work continued, with more than 8,000 new full-time positions created, on a seasonally-adjusted basis.
Employment Minister Kyam Maher said the trend rate was comparable to other states.
"We are in a better position than I think a lot of people thought we were going to be in with the closure of Holden," he said.
"But there is still a lot more work to be done, what it does indicate though that we're heading in the right direction is over the last 12 months, South Australia's recorded a bigger drop in its unemployment rate than anywhere else."
In October, South Australia's unemployment rate settled below 6 per cent for the first time in four years, a day ahead of the loss of nearly 1,000 Holden jobs.
With the carmaker's closure imminent, the Government pointed to strong investment across the state, including the sale of steelmaker Arrium to the GFC Alliance, $900 million invested into the Carrapateena copper mine by OZ Minerals, and Solar Reserve's $650 million solar thermal investment at Port Augusta.
The Liberal Opposition highlighted there were 10,200 fewer full-time jobs than there were in February 2010.

The Commonwealth Bank's ongoing woes around alleged systematic money laundering operations by criminal gangs and terrorists have deepened, with fresh claims the contraventions are continuing.

The allegations were raised as AUSTRAC filed a further 100 alleged breaches of Anti-Money Laundering/Counter Terrorism Financing (AML/CTF) as part of the existing Federal Court proceeding being run by the Government's financial transactions watchdog.
The damning new evidence alleges the CBA's breaches of AML/CTF laws have continued longer than first thought and AUSTRAC still was not being told about suspicious matter transactions well into this year.
The investigation centres on CBA's ATM network, or "intelligent deposit machines" (IDMs), and the bank's failure to monitor risks within the system.
In one case, a client who had been convicted of terrorism charges in Lebanon, and was known to have tried to organise funding for terrorist acts in Australia, was given 30 days' notice of the closure of his CBA account before AUSTRAC was even alerted.
He also managed to withdraw funds from the account more than a week after it was supposedly closed.
"On 20 July 2017, CommBank erroneously processed a transfer of $5,000 from CommBank Account 184 [the alleged terrorist funder] to an account held by Person 138 [his brother] in Lebanon in spite of suspecting terrorism financing in relation to an identical attempted transfer on 19 June 2017," AUSTRAC's new court statement alleged.
"Even though this was the second attempted international money transfer to Beirut that was suspected to be linked to terrorism financing, CommBank did not put a stop on CommBank Account 184 at this point.
"In spite of concluding on 26 June 2017, that potential terrorism financing was being conducted on CommBank Account 184, a stop was not put on CommBank Account 184 until 9 August 2017."
Even after that, nine days after the account was supposedly closed, $6,225 was withdrawn from the account of 184 at CBA's Bankstown Central branch.
In another instance, CBA failed to notify AUSTRAC about the actions of a drugs and firearms syndicate, which allegedly laundered $42 million through CBA ATMs and IDMs between 9 March 2016 and 8 August 2016.
NSW Police allege that the money mules would launder the money by making cash deposits into numerous bank accounts through branches, ATMs and IDMs.
"The money mules made structured cash deposits into the CommBank accounts identified ... to launder the funds of the drug and firearms syndicate," AUSTRAC alleged.
Under the act, CBA is required to alert AUSTRAC's chief executive within three days of any suspicious transactions brought to its attention.
The police received the details of the suspicious transactions on May 3. AUSTRAC is still waiting.
"At no time has CommBank given the AUSTRAC CEO an SMR [suspicious matter report] in relation to the matters," the statement noted.
The 100 new alleged contraventions take the total number of breaches under scrutiny to 53,800.
While not a big percentage increase, the worry for the bank is AUSTRAC's very dim view of work being done to remedy the systemic problem.
"After IDMs were first rolled out in May 2012 there were at least six periods of time within which CommBank should have, but did not, follow the procedures set out [for money laundering/terrorism funding risk management]," AUSTRAC's statement argued.
"The contravention is ongoing."

The new statement of claim also highlights a number of new instances where AUSTRAC was not informed of suspicious transactions, despite demands from state police for details of a number of suspicious transactions and red flags being raised within the bank itself.
That was in June this year.
"These allegations are very serious and reflect systemic non-compliance over approximately six years", AUSTRAC chief executive Nicole Rose said.
The fresh allegations follow many of the themes pursued in the original 600 page statement of claim, but are distilled down to four key points according to AUSTRAC:
The maximum penalty for each individual contravention alleged in the amended statement of claim is up to $21 million.
CBA said it will review the amended statement of claim and update the market as appropriate.
"We will file an amended defence in due course," CBA said in a statement released to stock exchange.
Despite AUSTRAC's assertions that breaches were ongoing, the bank said it had significantly upgraded and expanded its operations to ensure compliance with the AML/CTF Act.
"During 2017 we have stepped up the rigour and intensity of the program and extended it across all aspects of financial crime obligations and all business units to further strengthen regulatory compliance," CBA said.
In its response to AUSTRAC's initial allegations, the bank admitted it had failed to properly assess money laundering and terrorist funding risk adequately and issue suspicious matter reports in a timely matter before October 2015.
"CBA will submit that the extent of that harm should be assessed in the context of the significant number of SMRs issued in respect of the customers in question above and the fact that a number of the SMR contraventions relate to information itself derived from law enforcement," the bank said in a submission filed with the Federal Court.
AML/CTF law specialist and Latrobe University professor Louis de Koker said it was dangerous to speculate about what CBA should have done or what AUSTRAC would do.
"[However] some of CBA's risk management failures were basic and serious," Professor de Koker said.
He said CBA's admissions it failed to comply with an agreed program to manage and mitigate ML/TF risk were a particular concern.
"Those admissions are extraordinary," he said.
Thomson Reuters regional head of regulatory intelligence Nathan Lynch said the latest allegations around terrorist funding were a large escalation of the issue for the CBA.
"These are the most important issues to report under the AML/CTF regime and businesses have to file these with AUSTRAC within 24 hours," Mr Lynch said.
He argued the expansion of AUSTRAC's claim would ratchet up the pressure on CBA to settle.
"It's highly likely that both parties are already in discussions about the appropriate penalty and any other remedies the bank might have to undertake," he said.
"CBA has already admitted to the vast majority of the breaches, so there would be little to be gained for either side by taking this to trial.
"Any settlement with AUSTRAC would be dependent on the board overhauling the ambivalent risk culture that it believes had permeated the bank.
"Reading the claim, the regulator seems to think that culture built up over a period of years."
Editor's Note: While the CBA does not dispute a convicted terrorist used its accounts on two occasions to transfer money to Beirut, Lebanon, the transaction was reversed a week later after a CBA search revealed the potential terrorism link.

Don't get too excited just yet over the National Broadband Network's price drop — some experts say it might not make much of a difference to your current internet speeds.

The announcement today was part of a push to improve the reputation of the troubled NBN project.
Philippa Perry, spokeswoman for NBN Co, said they expected it would help improve the experience of people on the NBN network.
"Obviously there are a lot of other factors that can influence people's speeds and experiences — this is one way," she said.
"It's not a silver bullet by any means. But we believe that it will go some way to improving that experience for people."
The NBN Co will drop the price of internet plans it sells to service providers.
The intention is to encourage service providers to offer faster speeds to customers at a reasonable price.
However NBN Co could not guarantee customers would get cheaper or faster internet, saying the responsibility for any price cut fell to the providers themselves.
"It's really up to the retailers as to whether they choose to take on these packages," Ms Perry said.
"One question that I would suggest consumers ask their retailer is are they going to buy these products from NBN, and if so, what are the savings going to be and what sort of retail prices are they going to be put on to them.
"Already a couple of the retailers have taken up the immediate bandwidth boost and that's really positive to see from our perspective."

Ms Perry denied the announcement was an acknowledgment the previous pricing system was flawed.
"We've been selling packages on the NBN [since] 2010, I guess we've now reached volume and scale and we've really seen the way that the market is operating," she said.
Ms Perry said so far 85 per cent of NBN consumers had chosen packages of 25 mbps or less.
"We want to really unleash the capabilities of the NBN network and show them what it's capable of, so this is one way of incentivising them to buy higher-speed packages," she said.
"And also to incentivise the retailer to provide them with more bandwidth at peak hours when internet speeds can slow down a fair bit."
Rachel Thomas, senior policy adviser for the Australian Communications Consumer Action Network (ACCAN), said she supported the NBN price drop.
However, she warned consumers already on a contract not to wait to be offered the cheaper deal by their providers.
"That'll depend on each retailer, they don't have to offer these plans," she said.

"Some may not offer them at all, some may do a mixture of both the old and the new.
"So we do encourage consumers to check regularly that the plan that they are on suits their need."
She suggested consumers keep an eye out during 2018 for any new plans on offer.
And she said consumers should speak to their retailer to find out whether they were on the best plan.
"There are a lot of providers out there, so if you see a plan that has better prices or better speed then there are a lot of options for consumers to choose from," Ms Thomas said.
Nicholas Demos, the CEO of internet service provider My Republic, said while he was glad for the price drop, he doubted it would flow on to customers.
"I don't feel it's going to make for cheaper internet, but what it will make for is better service for customers," he said.
"So what the NBN have done is made the price for the 50 [mbps] speed for you the same as the 25.
"So instead for customers when they buy the price point of the 25, they'll now be getting the 50 speed. So it's better-level services at a better speed."
Service providers would still be able to buy the slower, more expensive plans from the NBN, even when the new pricing structure is brought in midway through next year.
Mr Demos said he was unsure whether his fellow service providers would choose to take up the NBN's new offer.
"We need to wait and see what all the existing service providers do — whether or not they give their customers a free speed boost," he said.
Major internet retailers Optus and Telstra have released statements saying they were reviewing the new pricing model, and would provide feedback to NBN Co.

The Australian dollar has jumped to 76.66 US cents, following the US Federal Reserve's rate hike and strong Australian job figures.
The local currency has surged by 1.2 per cent in the last 24 hours.
The dollar rally is understandable in the context of the ABS's latest job numbers, which blew the market's expectations out of the water.
The data showed that 62,000 new jobs were created in November when only 18,000 were expected.
What's more surprising is why the US dollar dropped against a basket of currencies (including the Australian dollar).
After all, the Fed's decision to lift interest rates by 25 basis points for the third time this year was meant to signify its vote of confidence in the US economy and makes the US a more attractive destination for investors.
One reason why the US dollar dropped is persistently weak inflation in America, said NAB currency strategist Rodrigo Catril.
He said this was evident in the weaker-than-expected US consumer price index overnight.

According to the Department of Labor, headline inflation was in-line with market expectations, up by 0.4 per cent last month (which translates to 2.2 per cent annual growth).
But core inflation (which excludes food and energy from its calculation) disappointed the market, lifting by only 0.1 per cent in November (instead of the expected 0.2 per cent).
This takes annual core inflation to 1.7 per cent, which undershoots the Fed's 2 per cent target.
The Fed attributes low inflation to one-off factors.
"Hurricane-related disruptions and rebuilding have affected economic activity, employment and inflation in recent months but have not materially altered the outlook for the national economy," it noted in its post-meeting statement.
But there was a hint of caution in its language, when it said the "near-term risks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced, but the committee is monitoring inflation developments closely."
Another reason Mr Catril suggested for the greenback's slide was the "dovish rate hike" by the Federal Reserve.
"Many were expecting the Fed to announce its expectation of four interest rate hikes next year," he explained.
However, the US central bank simply stuck to its previous forecast — three more hikes in each of 2018 and 2019.

It is almost as if the market did not believe the Fed's message when it said (in its post-meeting statement): "Economic activity will expand at a moderate pace and labour market conditions will remain strong".
"The Fed appears to lack a certain credibility with the market," said Axitrader's chief market strategist said Greg McKenna.
He also noted the greenback's weakness "makes little sense when taken against a backdrop of a US Fed tightening, a strong signal of more, and a positive outlook for the economy in the year and years ahead".
"Market pricing suggests they [traders] don't believe the Fed's outlook nor its rate projections".
Tonight's monetary policy decisions from the Bank of England and European Central Bank could be the next triggers for the Australian dollar's movements.
The BOE is not expected to announce a rate hike, as it only lifted UK interest rates last month (for the first time in more than a decade).
As for the ECB, the market will be paying close attention to whether it revises next year's European inflation forecast.
"In September, the ECB forecast that inflation would decline next year," NAB's Mr Catril said.
"But, since then, there has been buoyant economic data and expectations that the 2018-2020 inflation forecasts might be revised upwards."
He believes that, if that upgrade happens, it would put downward pressure on the Australian dollar.
"Our forecast is that the Australian dollar will will trade between 70 and 75 US cents next year," Mr Catril said.
"In the first quarter, we expect it to trend lower towards 73 cents, and then 72 cents later in the year."
He said NAB's forecast is downbeat because it isn't expecting "a very strong start of the year for commodities, which may not get much support from China compared to the past".

But a lot of the currency movements may be dictated by improving foreign economies — particularly the United States.
If the Republicans are able to enact President Donald Trump's much-touted tax reforms, it could potentially boost the greenback.
The Federal Reserve expects the corporate tax cuts may boost the economy in 2018, but leave no lasting impact.
But if the Fed continues to lift interest rates next year, it would make US currency investment more attractive than Australia's.
Australia's official interest rate is currently at a record low 1.5 per cent — and has been that way for more than a year.
In comparison, the US rate rose to 1.25-1.5 per cent with today's Fed hike.
All it would take is one more Fed rate hike before investors get equal or better returns from US investments.

Clare Sheng was determined to stay out of her family's clothing alteration business.
She can still recall every detail about the chores she endured inside the busy Rose Arcade workshop throughout her school years.
On a good day she would get to help her mum deliver mended clothes to some of Brisbane's finest retailers.

On other days she'd find herself elbow deep in dirty dish water, scrubbing tea, coffee and noodles off mugs and bowls piled high in the shop's only sink.
Almost 20 years later — and after vowing to never find work there — the young pharmacist is taking her mother's alteration business to new heights.
Ms Sheng is the director of The Fitting Room, Queensland's largest independent clothing alteration business.
Since joining her mother's business in 2011, she has doubled its revenue, changed its name, relocated the workshop, and attracted an impressive list of high-end clients.
This year she also took home awards recognising her business acumen, multiculturalism and contribution to the fashion industry.
"Every garment that you're fixing is like a problem you're solving for someone, and every solution is different," she told ABC Radio Brisbane.
"When people leave in their perfectly fitting garments they feel really good about themselves and they're very grateful to you."
Ms Cheng looks at ease inside the latest incarnation of the shop, darting between the front-of-house styling rooms and a white-walled workshop in the back; a cordless phone is glued to one ear.
But this isn't where she envisioned she would be after finishing her studies at the University of Queensland.
"As a Chinese girl everyone says, 'Go do pharmacy. It's a good job, it's stable, you can go have a baby and come back, you'll always have a job'.
"But when I started working I found I didn't actually enjoy it.
"You were either a pharmacist or a pharmacy owner and that's it — there's nowhere else to go."

Despite promising to never return, she found herself back at the family business after putting her pharmacy career on hold to start a family.
"As soon as I left pharmacy I knew I was never going back," Ms Sheng said.
"There was a eureka moment when I thought, 'Actually, I really like this and I can turn this business into something quite big', and that's when I started to take on the business role fully."
Ms Sheng said the clothing alteration industry had a better reputation now than it did when her mother arrived in Australia in 1999.
Wei Ping Yu grew up in China during the Cultural Revolution and migrated to Australia with her 11-year-old daughter in search of a better life.

Despite having limited English and struggling to make ends meet as a single mother, Ms Yu made a name for herself in the clothing alteration industry and started Brisbane City Clothing Alterations in 2008.
"Back then not everyone was used to having non-English speakers around," Ms Sheng said.
"There were a lot of difficult situations at school, in public and especially for my mum at work ... especially being in the clothing alterations trade which is quite low on the social ladder."
While Ms Sheng said she struggled with bullying at school, her mother faced it in the workplace.
"I have seen with my own eyes people treating her really badly," she said.
"We worked with a lot of high-end retailers and they would close the door in my mum's face while opening the door for a rich customer."
When Ms Sheng took a more active role in the business she realised her mother's attention to detail and relationships with clients were the qualities destined to turn its image around.
"She was the best at what she does but she devalued herself because clients have always treated her badly.
"She would only tell people, 'I can do this cheaper, I can do this faster', which is putting herself down when she can provide the best service and the best quality work."

Now she is committed to giving other marginalised workers an opportunity to join the industry.
"A lot of the staff we hire are from overseas; we have refugees and women who are coming back after staying at home for a number of years.
"There is no class system and there is no need to think someone is better than someone else."
Ms Sheng will release a book in 2018 advising men how to wear, style and care for suits.
She also launched a men's styling service this month to show clients how to improve their clothing and business etiquette.
Creating these new ventures was a matter of necessity.
Ms Sheng said she was forced to look for other income streams when fashion retail sales started to suffer three years ago.
"A lot of our clients were closing down, they were selling a lot less clothing, and that directly affected our business," she said.
"That's when I started to take more proactive action to try and get more clients by teaching them the value of dressing well."
The business's founder, Ms Yu, has stepped back from day-to-day alteration work and is now a part-time consultant who, conveniently, lives around the corner from her daughter.
And, bucking the trend of second-generation succession etiquette, Ms Sheng said her advice was always welcome.
"If I'm ever scared of trying something new she would say, 'Well I started the business with no money, no English and no education. If I can do it, you can do it'."

The competition watchdog will oppose the sale of more than 500 Woolworths-owned service stations to rival BP, amid concerns it would push up petrol prices.
BP currently supplies fuel to 1,400 BP-branded service stations around Australia, setting prices at about 350 of them.
It had planned to acquire the 531 service stations currently operated by Woolworths to add to that network.
However, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) said BP service stations currently averaged higher prices than Woolworths ones, and the acquisition would lessen that competition from the supermarket giant and probably push prices higher.
"BP prices at premium levels, whereas Woolworths is a strong price competitor," ACCC chairman Rod Sims told ABC News.
"So you find that BP's prices in the major capital cities are anywhere between 1.5 and 3 cents a litre greater than Woolworths.


"Fuel is such an important component of people's income and welfare that even a 1 to 2 cent a litre increase does matter," he said.
"So we think that is substantial and therefore meets the hurdle of a substantial lessening of competition."
However, Mr Sims said the difference in prices between Woolworths and BP could be even bigger at certain times in certain areas.
"It could be larger when you get the interplay of those [discounting] cycles," he added.
One of the reasons that BP has higher prices is that it supplies fuel to more than 1,000 independently operated service stations and does not want its own outlets to be seen to be consistently undercutting its wholesale customers.
"We believe it makes them a little more constrained in lowering prices because they would be seen then to compete with entities that are selling their fuel," Mr Sims explained.

Despite strong signals that the US economy is on the mend, Wall Street had a mixed day.

While the Dow Jones (+0.3pc) closed at a fresh record, the S&P 500 (-0.1pc) fell slightly below its breakeven point.
The S&P was dragged down by the financials sector (-1.3pc), which had its worst day since early-November.
The Nasdaq traded 0.2 per cent higher, driven by stocks in the healthcare sector (+0.3pc).
The Federal Reserve raised interest rates by 0.25 per cent on Thursday morning.
This is the third US rate hike this year, with the Federal Funds Rate now at 1.25-1.5 per cent.
The Fed projected three more hikes in each of 2018 and 2019 before a long-run level of 2.8 percent is reached — which is unchanged from the last round of forecasts in September.
"Economic activity has been rising at a solid rate...job gains have been solid," the Fed's policy-setting committee said in a statement.
Fed Chair Janet Yellen, in her last press conference before her four-year term ends early next year, pointed to the Trump administration's proposed tax overhaul as the impetus for an upgrade of policymakers' economic growth forecasts.
The Fed now sees gross domestic product growing 2.5 per cent in 2018, up from the 2.1 percent forecast in September.
"Most of my colleagues factored in the prospect of fiscal stimulus, along the lines of what is contemplated by Congress, into their projections," she said.
But Dr Yellen said the precise impact of the tax plan, which includes a sharp reduction in corporate income taxes, depended on various factors.
"While changes in tax policy will likely provide some lift to economic activity in coming years, the magnitude and timing of the macroeconomic effects of any tax package remain uncertain," she said.
The US Senate and House of Representatives have made progress with reconciling their competing tax reform bills.
Congressional Republicans reached a deal on the final form of the bill, the US Senate's top Republican tax writer said on Wednesday.
"I think we've got a pretty good deal," Senate Finance Committee chairman Orrin Hatch told reporters.
This would see the corporate tax cut would be slashed to 21 per cent — far below the present headline rate of 35 per cent.
Further details of the agreed legislation were not yet available, and a final bill could be formally unveiled as soon as Friday.
If President Donald Trump can sign the bill before year's end, it would be the first major legislative victory for him and the Republicans since they took control of the White House.
The ASX is expected to track Wall Street's solid performance, and open higher today.
The Australian dollar is considerably stronger, having risen 1 per cent to 76.33 US cents.
This is due to "broad‑based US dollar weakness", said Commonwealth Bank's Elias Haddad.
Mr Haddad believes there is room for the local currency to make further gains due to "favourable Australian employment conditions" and "encouraging Chinese November economic activity".
According to economists polled by Reuters, 18,000 new jobs will be created in November, the participation rate will remain steady at 65.1 per cent, and unemployment will be unchanged at 5.4 per cent.
Also out today is China's latest retail sales, fixed asset investment and industrial production figures.

The New South Wales Treasurer's attempt to sell his mid-year budget update has been overshadowed by questions about the Government's $2-billion stadiums plan.
The surplus for this financial year is now predicted to grow more than $600 million to $3.3 billion despite plummeting stamp duty revenue projections.
But Treasurer Dominic Perrottet was peppered with questions from journalists about whether spending $2 billion rebuilding both the Sydney Olympic and Sydney Football stadiums was the right move.
It is understood Mr Perrottet was among a number of senior Cabinet ministers who previously opposed the size of the stadium spend, but this morning he defended the plan.
"We have an Opposition that talks about schools before stadiums. But what I say is schools and stadiums," he said.
"And what you'll get under Labor is no schools and no hospitals, no stadiums because they left NSW with a $35 million infrastructure backlog."
Unveiling the surplus projections at a business breakfast in Sydney, Mr Perrottet said transfer duties were now predicted to bring in $461 million less this financial year than was forecast in the June budget.

He said the drop was driven by the large number of first home buyers taking advantage of the stamp duty exemptions announced just before the budget.
In the five months since the scheme began, 13,672 people have received stamp duty concessions, the Treasurer said.
"I am very happy to lose money to achieve that policy objective of getting young families into the market for the first time," he said.
Mr Perrottet also acknowledged the cooling property market was having an impact, noting that the average price of residential properties sold in 2017-18 was forecast to be only about 1.8 per cent higher than the average price for 2016-17.
But he said that had largely been factored into the budget projections in June.
"There is no doubt there are significant challenges and the best thing we can do is keep our fiscal discipline," Mr Perrottet said.
However, the projected drop in transfer duty revenue has been partly offset by higher-than-forecast payroll and land tax revenue due to an increase in full-time jobs and land values.
GST revenue is now predicted to be $119 million higher than forecast.
But overall, the Government is now expecting to make $149 million less in taxation revenue this financial year than it was predicting in June.
At the same time it has slashed its expenditure forecast for the year by $676.8 million for the financial year, largely by shifting the timing of expenditure across the forward estimates.

For hundreds of years, people have described showy or insubstantial schemes using a foamy metaphor: Jonathan Swift described the doomed South Sea Company as a "mighty bubble", Victorian-era slang dictionaries call fraudulent assurance promoters "bubble-men".

In the strictly economic sense, though, bubbles are attested from the late 19th century. There's just one problem: even today, economists can't agree on what constitutes one.
"Most people think they know it when they see it," says Timo Henckel, lecturer at the Australian National University's research school of economics.
Even, he says, if they can't describe it to you.
Experts generally agree that a bubble is created whenever any asset sees an extraordinary increase in price over a relatively short time span.
After that definitions get tricky: for a bubble to exist, the price of an asset must be divorced from its real value.
"Now the question is, what is that benchmark? No one can really agree," Dr Henckel says.
Sally Auld, chief economist at JP Morgan, says bubbles can occur in just about any asset, though they're more likely to occur when the asset itself is novel or poorly understood.
"The [1990s] tech bubble was a good example, because it started with new technology … people were unsure about what would happen in the future, and so rules around valuation went out the window," she says.
Easy access to credit from banks can further assist the creation of bubbles, Ms Auld says.
In her view, bubbles are most often found at the end of economic expansions, once people have lived through a period of sustained market optimism.
"Humans being what they are, they're conditioned to almost believe that the good times will last forever," she says.
Asset bubbles aren't unprecedented in history — the Dutch experienced tulipmania in the 16th century, and the Great Depression of the 1920s was caused by inflated stock prices.
For a while, though, it seemed the latter half of the 20th century might have overcome the asset volatility, high inflation and cycles of booms and crashes that had characterised previous eras.
"This belief has been shattered over the past 30 years," says Preston Teeter, a lecturer of international business at the University of South Australia.
In the 1980s Japan experienced one of the largest bubbles the world had ever seen, Dr Teeter says.
When it popped, house prices dropped by about 70 per cent.
"Their stock market, 30 years later almost, still has not recovered," Dr Teeter says.
Similar examples abound: in the early 2000s, the NASDAQ, a tech-heavy stock index in the United States, dropped by about 80 per cent over a two-year period following the dot com boom.
Some years later, the global financial crisis was itself precipitated by an asset bubble, in this case US housing.
"We've seen enormous bubbles in real estate, stocks and bonds," Dr Teeter says.
"What we've seen over the past 15 years is unprecedented in terms of scale and scope."
People expect economic theory to behave like Newtonian physics: clearly articulated forces operating in a defined manner to produce an expected outcome.
But Dr Henckel says a more fitting scientific parallel might be plate tectonics.

"A geologist would be able to point out where there is friction between two tectonic plates," he says, which is of no help to those trying to predict when the bubble might burst.
"Is the next earthquake going to be the one that relieves all the pressure?"
Even if people mange to identify when a bubble will burst, they aren't always listened to. Pundits looking at US tech stock valuations had doubts early as 1994, Dr Teeter says.
"You had sceptics in the media saying that this was a bubble," he says.
The market climbed exponentially before crashing, with the NASDAQ index returning to its pre-bubble value by 2003.
"A lot of these early sceptics look quite foolish on the way up," Dr Teeter says.
"These early sceptics are often right, but they're usually right much too early."
When a bubble does arrive, nations face an unenviable task. To extend the bubbly metaphor: banks, regulators and governments must take some of the air out of the bubble (reducing overvaluation of an asset) without popping it completely (destroying the stock and/or housing markets).
Ms Auld says central banks essentially have two levers to pull: raising interest rates, and tightening lending conditions.

"When you hike rates, that affects everyone with a floating rate mortgage. When you use macroprudential tools, what you're trying to do is affect the marginal borrower — the next person that walks into a bank and wants to borrow," she says.
But Ms Auld says neither lever is particularly easy to pull.
"You can't totally choke off credit to the system ... [and] the macroeconomy is just not robust enough to withstand a couple of great hikes," she says.
In Australia, the Reserve Bank has held interest rates steady for 13 consecutive ratings periods, which Ms Auld isn't surprised by.
"I don't really think they had much other option," she says.
For the Dr Henckel, prevention beats the cure.
"I would like to see more debate about possible policies to limit the build up of bubbles in the first place," he says.
That means countries taking a closer look at what kind of assets are likely to be targets of speculative behaviour, and whether that might affect the economy more broadly.
"Anyone who's followed the price activity in Bitcoin at the moment cannot help but think that this is a bubble," Dr Henckel says.
"Does this mean that the government should do something about Bitcoin? No, it's too small, it's too contained — but if you've got bubbles in the wider stock market or the housing market in particular then that should be a concern to policy makers."

The Salvation Army is defending its decision to back a Coca-Cola marketing campaign slammed by health groups as "cynical".
Last month a Coca-Cola truck embarked on a tour of regional Queensland and New South Wales, handing out gifts along the way as part of a Christmas-themed promotion.
Health groups have criticised the campaign as nothing more than a marketing exercise targeting communities with already-high obesity rates.
"It's actually using people who are on hard times, communities who are on hard times to sell their product, and I actually think it stinks," Michael Moore, the chief executive of the Public Health Association of Australia, said.
"The notion you would have sugary soft drinks supporting Christmas greetings and targeting children really is pushing the barrel too far."
But Salvation Army communications and fundraising director Leigh Cleave said the organisation was satisfied with the benefits of its relationship.
"The connections and the legacies that [Coca-Cola] left in each community, be they sporting equipment, community halls being done up, was really quite significant," Mr Cleave said.

"At one of the events that I was at, they had a feast on the beach with families and beautiful, wonderful healthy food and salads, and some people that we work with who struggle during the year were at this feast.
"We know that things like this don't solve people's problems, but at times like this at Christmas, when they can feel that someone's done something quite magical and special for them, that's something that is important to us."
Mount Isa Mayor Joyce McCulloch, said she did not have a problem when it visited her community.
"I think it's a wonderful initiative, considering that it's actually a European initiative and Coca-Cola have opted to bring their truck to Australia," Councillor McCulloch said.
Responding to health and parents' group's concerns, she said she had only had positive feedback about the tour.

"It's up to parents to control the negative side of what Coca-Cola actually does do, but it's not for me as a parent to tell other parents how to raise their children," she said.
In a statement, a Coca-Cola spokesperson said the locations the truck visited, which included Tamworth and Townsville, were independently identified as deserving communities.
They also said Coke had strict protocols about not marketing its products to children and served low-sugar drinks at Christmas truck events.
But the Public Health Association's Mr Moore said that did not allay his overall concerns.
"The reality is when we see Coke, people think of the normal Coke — the one they've been selling for a century — which has such a high content of sugar," he said.
"So I think that's the real concern. It's not as much what [Coca-Cola] are doing on the spot as their constant marketing and targeting of children."
So far, 14 health promotion organisations, including the Australian Dental Association, have signed a petition to stop the truck's tour.

Investors are bracing for a share market reaction after the Commonwealth Bank (CBA) admitted it breached Australia's money laundering and counter-terrorism regulations and indicated more charges could be brought against it.
Months after Australia's money laundering regulator, AUSTRAC, launched legal action against CBA, Australia's biggest bank has admitted it breached statutory disclosure laws more than 53,000 times.
AUSTRAC has indicated  it proposes to file an amended statement of claim containing additional alleged contraventions, CBA said in a statement to the ASX.
CBA said it would defend more than 100 more serious allegations regarding its alleged failure to disclose suspicious transactions.
The bank potentially faces multi-million-dollar fines. The matter is next due in court on March 16 next year.
AUSTRAC accused the CBA of failing to flag more than 53,000 transactions which exceeded a $10,000 limit and passed through its smart ATMs between November 2012 and September 2015.

In October, law firm Maurice Blackburn and litigation funder IMF Bentham filed a statement of claim in the Federal Court in Melbourne saying the CBA board knew of the potential breaches in the second half of 2015 and failed to inform shareholders for two years.
The class action is on behalf of all shareholders who bought CBA shares between July 2015 and August 3, 2017.
Top executives at the bank, including outgoing chief executive Ian Narev and current board chairwoman Catherine Livingstone, have been singled out in the class action as knowing about the compliance issues but failing to act.

Australia's energy market operator has today come close to triggering one of its emergency measures to prevent summer blackouts.
With high temperatures forecast for Adelaide, the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) contacted at least one South Australian company to tell it to be prepared to temporarily shut down.
A cool change, which arrived earlier than expected, meant that the company didn't need to follow through.

South Australian metal foundry Intercast and Forge is an electricity hungry business, with a power bill of about $8 million a year.
It's a key part of AEMO's plan.
Today it was contacted by AEMO and asked if it was "ready and willing to turn off this afternoon".
Intercast and Forge could get as little as 10 minutes notice from the AEMO.
"The regulator will give us a call or a text message, they will ask us to turn off at least 10 megawatts of power," foundry general manager Brett Lawrence told 7.30.
"What will happen then, for our factory, is it will shut down for up to four hours.
"What that will mean for the rest of the grid is there's far less likely to have rolling blackouts through the grid."
The foundry will be paid about $350,000 to shut down.
It is one of eight companies taking part in a $36-million so-called demand response trial.
"It's really going to be a bag of tricks that enables the system to be far more secure," Mr Lawrence said.
"So I think it's not a band-aid, it's actually a good way in which all the parties in the market can work together."

AEMO is on high alert after criticism of its management last summer, particularly after South Australia's statewide blackout and when power was deliberately cut to homes during a February heatwave.
The situation became even more acute when Victoria's 1,600-megawatt Hazelwood power station closed in March.
Apart from industry shut-downs, AEMO is bringing on new gas generation.
"We've gone out and gotten additionally, essentially close to 2,000 megawatts extra of resources that are going to be available to us," chief executive Audrey Zibelman said .
"It's those resources that are going to be replacing Hazelwood.
"Compared to last summer we feel like we've done everything we can and have done all the right things to make sure the system is ready."

The South Australian Government claims $700 million worth of water, transport and hospital infrastructure projects could be delayed because of a political stand-off over the cost of creating a state-owned power station.
The Liberal Opposition is seeking to use Parliament's Public Works Committee to force the Government to reveal the cost of buying nine turbine generators, which the Government intends to use to build a 276 megawatt back-up power plant.
The Government is refusing to outline the precise cost of the generators — which are currently installed under a lease agreement at Elizabeth and Lonsdale — citing the terms of its contract with the generators' owner APR Energy.
Liberal MPs David Pisoni and Peter Treloar staged a walk out of last week's Public Works Committee meeting after Labor committee members rejected the Liberals' push to bring the power plant project back before the committee.
Mr Pisoni, the shadow infrastructure minister, has flagged his intention to recall the power plant project when the committee meets again on Thursday.
"It's critical that I as a member of Parliament use the mechanisms available to me to force this Government to be open and transparent," he said.
"We know that they are hostile to transparency, and even more so in the lead up to [the March] election. The facts are that South Australians need to know."
But Infrastructure Minister Stephen Mullighan said another walk-out by Liberal committee members would mean more than a dozen government projects would not be approved.
"This is completely unacceptable. We've got a dozen projects worth $700 million together which will support hundreds of South Australian jobs, dozens of South Australian businesses," he said.
"The Liberal Party once again is showing they don't believe in investment in infrastructure in South Australia."

Mr Mullighan said the projects included the State 3 redevelopment of the Queen Elizabeth Hospital, the Northern Irrigation Scheme, Gawler Rail Electrification Project and a number of metropolitan intersection upgrades.
"These elected members are refusing to do their job, refusing to turn up to a parliamentary committee meeting and approve these projects."
Mr Pisoni said walking out of a committee meeting was a legitimate method of forcing the Government to release costing details.
"If the Government thinks secrecy ... and a lack of transparency are much more important than building these projects — we will build them if there's a change of government come March."
Mr Mullighan branded the Opposition's move as a stunt, adding that details of the cost of the power plant had been provided to committee members on a confidential basis back in August.
"They know what the cost is. They know we're going to release these costs publicly. This is only a stunt by the Liberal Party so that they don't have to back investment in infrastructure around South Australia," he said.

But Mr Pisoni said the figures given to the committee in August did not square with Premier Jay Weatherill's recent pronouncements that the cost of the generators would be met from within the budgeted cost of his Government's $550 million energy plan.
"That is not the information that we received in camera back in August. So this is why it's critical that this project be returned to the Public Works Committee," Mr Pisoni said.
Mr Mullighan said the full cost of the generators would be revealed in "a matter of weeks" once APR Energy had concluded tendering processes for a number of other projects interstate.

Although consumer confidence has jumped to a four-year high in the lead-up to Christmas, there are no guarantees this will translate into more spending.

This is due to slow wages growth, a low savings rate and high household debt levels, according to Westpac and the Melbourne Institute in their latest monthly consumer report.
Sentiment rose 3.6 per cent to 103.3 points in December — a result which improves on its November result (99.7) and a slump in consumer spending during the September quarter.
A result above 100 points means, out of the 1,200 people surveyed for the report, there were more optimists than pessimists.
"This is a surprisingly strong result and confirms the lift we have seen in the index over the last three months," said Westpac's chief economist Bill Evans.
These findings come after NAB's business survey out yesterday revealed a sharp drop in business conditions.
Mr Evans believes a "less threatening outlook for interest rates" is one reason behind the boost in confidence.

"During that September quarter households were spooked by media and many commentators saying that interest rates were likely to start rising in the new year," he said.
"That effect has now calmed down significantly."
In fact, Westpac's position is that the Reserve Bank is unlikely to raise interest rates until 2019.
Mr Evans suggested recent developments in Australian politics are other reasons behind the bounce in consumer confidence.
In particular, he said there was probably a "feelgood effect" for consumers after the Federal Government passed marriage equality legislation last week.
This was in addition to the speculation that the Government may introduce personal and business tax cuts next year.
The Commonwealth Bank welcomed the latest consumer confidence results.
"Household spending accounts for around 60 per cent of the economy," said CBA senior economist Kristina Clifton.
"So households being able to maintain a decent rate of spending growth is a key requirement for the economy to be able to meet our and the RBA's forecasts for GDP growth of 3 per cent over the coming years."
Another area of improvement was the "time to buy a dwelling" index, which has risen slightly over 100 (by just 0.6 points), a one-year high.
In this case, a result above 100 means consumers think it is a good time to buy real estate.
But the results varied significant from state to state — with Queenslanders (121) and Western Australians (122) being the most optimistic.
On the other end of the spectrum were NSW (90) and Victoria (88), the nation's most expensive property markets.

Also, despite the well-known issues of low wage growth in Australia and a recent surge in petrol prices, confidence in family finances rose to 89.6 this month (up from 84.8 in November).
Capital Economics economist Kate Hickie believes this may be due to "the continued strength of the labour market".
After all, the "unemployment index" within the Westpac-Melbourne Institute report fell from 130.8 to 127.6.
This appears to be "consistent with the unemployment rate nudging down from 5.4 per cent to closer to 5 per cent," Ms Hickie said.
So what is the key take-out from all of this?
"The leap in the Westpac measure of consumer confidence in December will be a welcome sight for retailers in the middle of the all-important Christmas shopping period," she said.
"Nonetheless, with household budgets still tight, we remain cautious about the outlook for consumption growth."

There will be only one airline flying from Darwin to Bali, after budget airline AirAsia announced it will cut its services in Darwin.
The Bali-Darwin route will be suspended from January 28, 2018, with Jetstar the only airline to fly between Darwin and the popular island destination.
In a statement, AirAsia said the suspension was part of broader restructuring plan.
"AirAsia Indonesia will suspend its service connecting Bali with Darwin as part of a network restructuring aimed at improving operational efficiency," the company said.
"AirAsia Indonesia would like to sincerely apologise for any inconvenience caused by the suspension of this route."
The spokesman said guests who held bookings for after January 28 would be entitled to change their travelling date, a credit or a full refund.
Opposition Leader Garry Higgins has called on the NT Government to take action on the airline's decision.
"The Indonesian market presents a unique opportunity for the Territory for business and trade, and it is vital we have direct access via as many flights as possible," he said.
"It is particularly disappointing that AirAsia has opted to withdraw its direct services to Bali from Darwin.
"I call on the Government to pursue this issue with AirAsia accordingly."
The loss comes when government representatives, including Tourism Minister Lauren Moss, are in China trying to secure direct flights from one of China's major cities, Shenzhen to Darwin.
From China, Ms Moss said the Government was disappointed AirAsia had suspended four international routes into Bali, including Darwin and that the recent eruption of Mt Agung was a contributing factor.
"Uncertainty created by the imminent eruption of Mt Agung has had a significant impact on holiday demand into Bali and has disrupted flights over the month," she said.
"These factors underpin AirAsia's commercial decision to suspend flights."
Despite healthy numbers of Darwinites travelling to Bali, AirAsia needed to recover from the losses it incurred when thousands of travellers were stranded for weeks after ash from Mt Agung closed Bali's Ngurah Rai Airport, according the Head of Aviation Development at NT Airports, Matthew Findlay.
Mr Findlay thinks there is a possibility the AirAsia service could return to Darwin.
"If you were a recent traveller on AirAsia you would have seen that the number of seats filled on their flights were quite high and that's certainly what we've seen in the last few months," he said.
"In the last six months, load factors have increased from 77 per cent to 84 per cent.
"The benchmark for any airline is anything above 80 per cent means you're doing well."
Mr Findlay said the suspension was part of AirAsia's restructure after taking a hit in the wake of the chaos at Bali international airport.
"It's a complicated activity, running an airline and when volcanic activity occurs, and they can't predict that, obviously, they need to build some fat into the system," he said.
"So whenever you have instances where you need to recover from a delay elsewhere, and you don't have any fat in the system, something has got to give.
"It's been a bit of a disappointment for us.
"We've seen this great improvement in connectivity and load factors but they [AirAsia] need to somehow allow so capacity can get back into the system, which is why they're suspending flights in Darwin, two places in India and in Kuala Lumpur."

Holiday units in the Palmer Coolum Resort, which has been mothballed since March 2015, have been listed on Airbnb in time for the school holidays.
Once regarded as one of south-east Queensland's most prestigious resorts, the site is a shadow of its former self and has been the centre of a legal battle between retirees who own villa shares and Clive Palmer.
A range of listings for units in the resort, owned by the eccentric billionaire and former politician, have appeared up on the popular online booking accommodation service.

But Maree Frecklington, who has owned a villa share in the resort since 2004 and regularly stays in it even though it has no water and electricity, warned the main pool was brown.
She said the mosquitoes were bad and blamed the stagnant pool, fearing it was a health issue for workers on site.
However the tennis pool, a smaller pool located near the tennis courts, was clean and in good condition, Ms Frecklington said.
Ms Frecklington, the mother-in-law of newly elected Opposition Leader Deb Frecklington, visited the resort this week.
Other images appeared to show damage to the site from recent thunderstorms.
"The village pool is getting ... the water level is higher and higher and its getting greener and greener," she said.

She said she still did not have running water or electricity connected to her villa, although other villas and resort rooms in the complex did and workers had been on site cleaning those areas.
The Airbnb listing advises the properties are located "within Palmer Coolum Resort" and include use of the tennis court, golf course and the tennis court swimming pool.
Units range in price from $142 a night for ground-floor studio to $415 a night for a two-bedroom villa.
"Take advantage of playing one of Queensland's most iconic golf courses during your stay. The magnificent Palmer Coolum Resort golf course is located less than 5 mins walk from your studio. Guests have use of Tennis Court and Pool," the listing reads.
Ms Frecklington said she had kept ownership of her share of the resort villa as it had been a place her son, Jason and his wife Deb, had enjoyed visiting.
Neither Mr Palmer or the resort manager could be reached for comment.

The Northern Territory should "get on with the job" of lifting its hydraulic fracturing moratorium now that it has a draft report on the industry which says the risks can be mitigated, says the Minister for Northern Australia.
The draft report, released on Tuesday, found that with more "robust and rigorous" regulation, the risks of fracking could be reduced, and that provided that the recommendations were adopted and implemented, "not only should the risk of any harm be minimised to an acceptable level, in some instances, it can be avoided altogether".
But among its 120 recommendations, it says that before any production takes place, the NT Government conduct baseline groundwater studies, which could take two to three years to complete.
The inquiry, which is under pressure from industry to speed up its work, is in its final stages and will hold consultations with communities next month before handing down a final report in March next year.
Fracking was a highly contentious issue during last year's NT election and the Labor Government took power in part due to its promise to allay community concerns by putting a moratorium in place until the controversial practice could be reviewed.
In October, the ABC reported that remote Aboriginal residents said they had been pressured by consultants working for the inquiry to exploit the benefits from an "inevitable" industry.
Northern Australia Minister Matt Canavan said on Wednesday that the sooner the onshore fracking industry could get going in the NT, the better.
He said it could potentially boost the NT economy by $17 billion and create 10,000 new jobs over an unspecified time period.
"Jobs is what you need, investment is what you need, and this gas opportunity is really the next step for Darwin and the Northern Territory," Senator Canavan said.
"I hope there's no further delays because I think the Northern Territory needs an economic shot in the arm."

But despite urging the NT Government to permit the industry to operate, Senator Canavan said that any development needed to be taken forward with robust environmental controls, and that he would be happy to wait until groundwater studies were completed.
"That includes, in the case of gas, ensuring that groundwater is not damaged … so if we need to do those sorts of studies that our groundwater resources are protected, that's what we have to do," he said.
"It just underlines how important it is to get moving as soon as possible because these things do take time … no-one here is saying that we should fast-track a project and put environmental standards at risk.
"You can't compromise the environment for the economy, that is absolutely fundamental."
Senator Canavan said there had been several reports on the issue in the NT over the past few years, and that he didn't think another review had been necessary.
"It seems to have come to similar conclusions as others which is good, but we've really got to get on with the job now," he said.

The Lock The Gate Alliance environmental group said it was happy with the draft report; spokeswoman Naomi Hogan said the number of recommendations was too exhaustive for fracking to go ahead.
"The ability of the Territory Government and regulators to put in place those 120 stringent regulations, and to face all of the further work that's required — the question is, is it worth putting water at risk and communities in gas fields?" she said.
She said the list of recommendations also identified areas where there was insufficient data, and questioned whether the NT Government would be able to deal with "all of those uncertainties that are still not been dealt through the report".
"Water quality and surface and groundwater quality were not able to be determined at this point," she said.
Lock the Gate also said January's consultation phase would have a significant impact on the final outcome of the inquiry.
"The communities living on the frontline of these proposed gas fields should be able to have their say on whether or not they want to live on a gas field and whether the risks are appropriate for their community," Ms Hogan said.
"I expect them to have a strong say in the next phase."

The gas industry has continued its sustained pressure on the Government to make a decision and give it certainty.
The NT branch of Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association (APPEA) agreed with the finding that there were no risks that could not be managed by an effective regulatory regime.
"We've got some concerns here that the panel is drawing on the regulatory approach of jurisdictions which effectively have no industry such as NSW, whereby a moratorium is removed … but the regulatory system is so burdensome, inefficient and costly that it effectively kills investment in our sector," director Matt Doman said.
He supported the collection of groundwater baseline samples, saying "we can gather the science as we go".
"We absolutely support the gathering of information before we move to production and full-scale development," Mr Doman said.

"If we can resume exploration drilling and the fracking that is involved in exploration at a very small and limited scale to continue to conduct water studies, methane studies, look at every aspect of the environmental performance and impact of our industry, [then] we'll do that on an ongoing basis."
Mr Doman urged the NT Government to act decisively.
"This has been a 12-month inquiry that is now entering into its second year; it is time for the inquiry to be brought to a conclusion and for the Government to make a decision about the development of the NT resources and the manner and in which that will or won't proceed," he said.

The Australian dollar is headed for a drop towards 68 US cents in the next year-and-a-half — if the nation's economy continues to remain stuck in the slow lane.
That is according to Westpac's forecast, which factors in a continued rebound for foreign economies including the US, UK and Canada, as they are likely to announce rate hikes over the next year.
Furthermore, the European Central Bank is in the process of "quantitative tightening" as it plans to slash its monthly bond purchases in half — to €30 billion ($45.6 billion).
Westpac expects the Aussie dollar to fall to 74 US cents within half a year (June 2018).
By the end of next year (December 2018) it is expected to slip further to 70 US cents, and then 68 US cents (by June 2019).
With higher interest yields overseas, the case for buying the Australia dollar may become less attractive, according to AxiTrader's chief market strategist Greg McKenna.
"Forex traders have a predisposition to sell Aussie on rallies at the moment and to take any bearish news — data — as an excuse to hit the sell button," Mr McKenna said.
"That the Aussie is languishing at the moment ... is kind of remarkable given that the global growth outlook is so positive for the year ahead."
The US interest rate decision on Thursday morning (5:00am AEDT) could be the next trigger for the local currency's dip.

It is all but certain the Federal Reserve will raise the Federal Funds Rate to 1.25-1.5 per cent, its third increase this year.
Apart from the rate hike, the market will be paying close attention to the Fed's forecasts for 2018 — in particular, how many times it expects to lift interest rates next year.
"The prospect of a Fed rate hike in December is 100 per cent priced in," said Westpac's senior currency strategist Sean Callow.
"So far, we have predicted the Fed will raise interest rates twice next year.
"But if the Fed surprises us and says it wants to lift rates three times in 2018, we're inclined to think the greenback will benefit from higher yields, which may knock the Australian dollar down to 75 US cents."
The Australian dollar is currently sitting at 75.72 US cents (1:20pm AEDT).
The other economic news which could affect the local currency is the Australian Bureau of Statistics' jobs report (out on Thursday at 11:30am AEDT).
According to economists polled by Reuters, 18,000 new jobs will be created in November, the participation rate will remain steady at 65.1 per cent, and unemployment will be unchanged at 5.4 per cent.
But if the jobs report falls below those expectations, the impact is not expected to be so significant.
"If the Australian jobs report is softer than expected, the market won't get freaked out, given 2017 has been a strong year for employment," Mr Callow said.
Westpac expects Australia's official interest rate to stay at the record low 1.5 per cent for the whole of next year.

If the Fed lifts interest rates twice next year, as expected, that would bring its rate to 1.75-2 per cent.
It would be a rare occurrence if Australia's rates fall below US rates, as this not happened in almost two decades.
In fact, the last time this occurred was between 1997 and 2001, when the Australian dollar was buying between 48 and 74 US cents.
As for the forces which weakened the local currency back then, they included the introduction of the GST (in 2000), and the influx of capital into the US economy due to the dotcom boom.
"Things are different now with Australia's terms of trade," an optimistic Mr Callow said.
"Back then, Australia wasn't getting as much demand from China as it is now, so commodity prices will provide some cushion for the Aussie dollar."
"The dollar will likely be stable in the first half of 2018, even with softness in the nation's bulk commodity exports, driven by increased supply rather than a drop-off in Chinese demand."

Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has levelled fresh criticism at Sam Dastyari for continuing to pocket his parliamentary income despite announcing his resignation.

Senator Dastyari revealed on Tuesday that he was quitting the Upper House over his links with China, but the New South Wales powerbroker has not provided any clarity about his official departure date.
The wording of his statement yesterday was unclear, only confirming he would "not return to the Senate in 2018".
The basic wage for senators is $199,040 a year, handing him at least $30,000 if he does not make his resignation official until the New South Wales Parliament resumes in February and endorses his replacement.
Mr Turnbull has called on the outgoing senator to make his resignation official now, and relinquish any claim to further Commonwealth funds.
"Sam Dastyari should get out of the Senate right now," he said.
"He hasn't resigned yet.
"He's still taking money from the taxpayers of the country that he put second."

But Opposition Leader Bill Shorten said Senator Dastyari should be given time to deal with electorate issues and organise his office and his staff.
"What I expect Senator Dastyari will do is that sooner rather than later he will wrap up his matters," he said.
"But let's be clear, there is electorate work, you can't just leave punters in the lurch."
Mr Shorten highlighted a number of cases where Liberal senators left a lag between announcing their exit and officially leaving.
Former Coalition Senator Brett Mason stayed on for 23 days, Michael Ronaldson for 73 days and Chris Back for 46 days.
Mr Shorten said it was also "sensible" to allow Senator Dastyari to give his staff appropriate notice.

Mr Turnbull called on the Opposition Leader to intervene and force Senator Dastyari to exit straight away.
"Sam Dastyari has behaved shockingly but it is Bill Shorten who wants to be prime minister," he said.
"He wants to have my job. If you want to be prime minister you've got to show that you always put Australia first.
"Shorten has not done that."
In delivering his resignation statement yesterday, Senator Dastyari said he had decided to stand down to "spare the party any further distraction", but he also defended his actions as a senator.
"Reflecting on the events which led to my decision, I leave knowing that I have always honoured my parliamentary oath, I have always acted with integrity, and I remain a loyal, patriotic Australian," he said.
For more than a year the Government has been calling for Senator Dastyari to quit his Senate post over his dealings with Chinese businessman and political donor Huang Xiangmo.
The senator originally stepped down from the Labor frontbench when it emerged he had allowed the donor to pay a legal bill on his behalf.
Critics strengthened their attacks last month when Fairfax reported Senator Dastyari warned Mr Huang that his phone was probably being tapped by US agencies.
Explosive leaked audio has also shown the senator went against Labor policy and defended China's stance on the South China Sea at a media event standing side by side with Mr Huang.
Further clouding his reputation was another Fairfax report that Senator Dastyari tried to convince deputy Labor leader Tanya Plibersek not to meet a Chinese political activist.
On Wednesday, Ms Plibersek said her colleague had made mistakes.
"I think Sam Dastyari has paid a very high price for some poor judgement," she said.
"I really think that hounding a guy who's already said he's leaving is a bit rich."

They have been encouraged to tell their stories following the sexual abuse allegations engulfing Hollywood and producer Harvey Weinstein.
Over 360 women, including high-profile artists Tina Arena, Missy Higgins and The Veronicas, have signed an open letter demanding change in the music industry.
When Sydney electronic artist Phebe Starr first started performing at gigs, she was playing with other bands to learn the ropes.
But there was one performance she said she would never forget.
"I was playing a show at Oxford Arts Factory supporting an electronic band full of guys, and when I was playing my set there was a big crowd there and it was a really good atmosphere," she said.
But the atmosphere soon turned ugly when a male in the crowd grabbed her and pulled her offstage and into the throng.
"His friends touched me inappropriately. One of the guys whispered something very explicit, and then the main guy who pulled me into the crowd licked all up my arm and my face," Starr said.
"I just stood in the crowd completely shocked and the security guard pulled this guy off me.
"I ran off the stage and I went side of stage and kind of had a bit of a panic attack, I didn't finish the rest of my set.
"I went backstage and I told the band that I was supporting what had happened. The guys were like, 'Oh yeah, that happens to all of our female colleagues'."

"Then they just turned their backs on me and started drinking. I was just standing there, shocked.
"I'd just been abused and I guess my expectations were [that] I would tell this band who were older, more knowledgeable, wiser and in a position of power to do something, and they kind of just dismissed it as normal."

It has been this kind of reaction to sexist comments and sexual harassment in the music scene that has led women like Starr to demand it stop.
She has joined close to 400 women speaking out about the discrimination, harassment, violence, and sexist jargon that plagues their industry.
"I signed the open letter because I felt like it was a really good way of starting a conversation about the cultural aspects of the music industry which are very damaging to women," Starr said.
"Which people in power may not actually understand or acknowledge."

Jessica Veronica tweeted about signing the letter:

Sydney band The Preatures wrote:

Last month almost 2,000 women working in the Swedish music business also signed an open letter condemning widespread sexual abuse and harassment.
Starr said now her hope was for more people in the music scene to come forward and feel supported when they do.
"There's enough voices to say this isn't just one or two people, this is a whole group of people who have had this same experience," she said.
Australian musician Rowan Dix, known as Joyride, said he was happy that more voices were finally being heard within the industry.

He said it was now a crucial time for the industry to take a hard look at itself.
"When things like this happen it's important to remember it's a time for people like me — who are straight, white and middle class — time to listen, rather than to add another voice into the equation," he said.
"It's time to listen, take things on board."

The Reserve Bank governor has talked down the chances of a Government-issued cryptocurrency, despite a massive increase in electronic transactions.
In a speech in Sydney, Dr Philip Lowe said the major cryptocurrencies are not very effective as a way to pay for things, with high transaction costs, including the massive amounts of energy needed to "mine" them.
"When thought of purely as a payment instrument, it seems more likely to be attractive to those who want to make transactions in the black or illegal economy, rather than everyday transactions," he said.
"So the current fascination with these currencies feels more like a speculative mania than it has to do with their use as an efficient and convenient form of electronic payment."

These views echo weekend comments by Dr Lowe's counterpart in New Zealand, who said bitcoin's rapid ascent to $US17,369 ($22,987) — a more than 2,000 per cent increase over the past year — showed all the signs of pure speculation.
"It looks remarkably like a bubble forming to me," Reserve Bank of New Zealand acting governor Grant Spencer told TVNZ.
"Over the centuries we've seen bubbles, and this appears to be a bit of a classic case.
"With a bubble, you never know how far it's going to go before it comes down."
Investment bank JP Morgan's boss Jamie Dimon has gone further, calling bitcoin a "fraud" that will eventually "blow up".
Dr Lowe said previous experiments with privately-issued currencies showed that they were not reliable and stable.
"Experience cautions that there are significant difficulties and dangers associated with privately issued fiat money," he said.
"The history of private issuance is one of periodic panic and instability. In times of uncertainty and stress, people don't want to hold privately issued fiat money.
"This suggests that if there were to be an electronic form of banknotes that was widely used by the community, it is probably better and more likely for it to be issued by the central bank."

However, Dr Lowe said the Reserve Bank currently saw no need for an electronic currency, given advances currently underway in the electronic payments system.
"Our current working hypothesis is that with the NPP [New Payments Platform] there is likely to be little additional benefit from electronic banknotes," he went on to say.
"Having less of an electronic fingerprint hardly seems the basis for building a public policy case to issue an electronic form of the currency. So there would need to be more than this."
Dr Lowe said that the introduction of the NPP, which will allow near real time electronic payments to be made through the banking system, dramatically reduced the need for separate electronic payment methods.
"There is a certain attraction of being able to make payments from funds held in prudentially regulated accounts that can earn interest," he added.
Reserve Bank figures show that the overwhelming majority of payments are already made electronically, with cash now accounting for less than 40 per cent of transactions.

Physical cash only makes up about 3.5 per cent of the total money in Australia, with the rest held as deposits in private banks.
"So the vast majority of what we know today as money is a liability of the private sector, and not the central bank, and is already electronic," Dr Lowe said.
However, despite most payments being done electronically, RBA figures also show that there have been more banknotes on issue over the past few years than at any other point over the past five decades.

Dr Lowe also warned that an official electronic currency issued by the Reserve Bank on behalf of the Australian Government could carry risks to the banking system.
"If we were to issue electronic banknotes, it is possible that in times of banking system stress, people might seek to exchange their deposits in commercial banks for these banknotes, which are a claim on the central bank," he explained.
"It is likely that the process of switching from commercial bank deposits to digital banknotes would be easier than switching to physical banknotes.
"In other words, it might be easier to run on the banking system."
Dr Lowe said there would be similar problems if people had electronic transaction accounts at the RBA.
"In times of stress, it is highly likely that people might want to run from what funds they still hold in commercial bank accounts to their account at the RBA," he said.

US stocks reached fresh record closing highs again, as the US central bank began its two-day meeting to discuss interest rates.

Bank stocks rose on the prospect of the Federal Reserve's third rate rise this year, a 0.25-percentage-point increase to 1.25-1.5 per cent is expected when the Fed's policy meeting committee hands down its decision tomorrow.
ANZ economists think the writing is on the wall.
"The FOMC is widely expected to raise rates, but the tone [of the statement] may be dovish," they wrote.
"Focus will also be on developments in tax reform and US CPI [inflation], although neither is expected to provide much impetus to the US dollar."
Spot gold fell to its lowest level in six months on the expected rise in US interest rates.
Oil prices jumped to $US65 a barrel because of a shutdown in the UK's biggest North Sea oil pipeline and an explosion at a major gas pipeline hub in Austria, which left one person dead and more than twenty people injured.
Aircraft maker Boeing jumped more than 3 per cent after it said it would increase its quarterly dividend by 20 per cent and replace its existing share buyback program with a new $US18 billion program.
US shopping centre stocks increased following the announcement that Australian retail landlord Westfield Corporation will sell its international shopping centres to French retail giant Unibail-Rodamco.
Westfield Corporation runs 45 shopping centres and airport retail precincts in the US, UK and Italy, including the retail space in the new World Trade Centre in New York.
The nearly $33 billion ($US24.7 billion) deal is the biggest takeover of an Australian company on record and will create one of the largest retail real estate companies globally.
But investors questioned Unibail's judgment in expanding in the struggling world of bricks and mortar retail in the face of the online sales juggernaut.
Unibail-Rodamco shares fell 4 per cent in European trade.
Analysts from Citi think it appears to be a good value deal on the face of it.
"We believe Unibail-Rodamco are acquiring the best in the business," they wrote.
"However, while pricing appears favourable, our broader concern is the reason why one of the most successful pioneers of shopping centres are selling to Unibail-Rodamco."
Westfield founder Frank Lowy and his sons, Peter and Steven, are excellent business people with supreme timing. In other words they know when to get out.
The Lowy family will maintain a substantial investment in Unibail-Rodamco.
The shares will trade as one stock on Euronext Amsterdam and in Paris and will have a secondary listing on the Australian stock exchange.
In economic news, US producer prices rose a stronger than expected 0.4 per cent in November and by 3.1 per cent over the year, which points to firmer inflation, something that will please the Fed.

Australia's domestic gas supplies are increasing, but prices are still too expensive.
Those are the key findings of the latest report by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) into the nation's gas market.
In September, the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) and the ACCC warned the east coast of Australia would face a gas shortfall in the first half of 2018 if gas producers failed to boost supply.
The Federal Government threatened to impose export restrictions on producers to ensure Australian consumers were prioritised before international markets.
The gas companies later agreed to boost supply.
ACCC chairman Rod Sims said the gas supply shortage had had "a catastrophic effect on the Australian economy".
"It's meant that gas prices have gone up a lot — doubled, tripled, quadrupled for some businesses and some consumers," he told AM.
"And it meant that some companies just could not get gas, there just wasn't enough gas."
But Mr Sims said the deal struck between the Federal Government and gas producers two months ago had already been felt, even though prices were still above the levels the ACCC wanted to see.
"What we've seen is LNG producers have reduced exports to provide more gas to the domestic market, and that has overcome the shortfall, and that has seen prices for many companies fall from around $16 [per gigajoule] to around $8 to $12," he said.
"So we no longer have a shortfall and prices have come off somewhat.
"It's certainly a better picture, the market still has some problems, but it's a much better picture now than we had a couple of months ago."
The Australian Industry Group's Tennant Reed warned against celebrating too soon, suggesting businesses were still facing high gas costs.
"Rather than getting absolutely hammered on their next contract, they will instead be pained, or at best peeved."
Chief executive of the Australian Meat Industry Council Patrick Hutchinson was encouraged by the findings.

However he argued his members were yet to see their power bills drop in regional Australia.
"It is a massive issue that is showing no signs of abatement," Mr Hutchinson told AM.
"It may well be manufacturing may be getting an increase in gas, or opportunities for gas. But unfortunately that may be starting at metro first."
In a swipe at the Federal Government's priorities, Mr Hutchinson sought to remind the Coalition that his sector was among those most exposed to power prices.
He argued more attention was being focused on recent by-elections in key seats than on the plight of his members.
"How about you get out there and see what's happening in rural and regional Australia?"
The ACCC report also warned that the southern states were still having to rely on Queensland gas production to meet demand.
Unsurprisingly, the Federal Energy Minister took a swipe at some states' opposition to gas exploration in spruiking the ACCC's findings.
"We are encouraging the states to undertake geological surveys of the resources that they have, and to provide more incentives to the landowners and to the farmers to develop these gas fields," Josh Frydenberg told AM.
"The experience overseas, particularly in the United States, is if the landowners can get more of a reward for the development of gas on their land, then they will do it, and you will overcome some of the objections that we've seen to date."
Mr Frydenberg said it was the Government's intention to keep the gas supply deal with producers in place.

The Northern Territory's inquiry into hydraulic fracturing has found that with more "robust and rigorous" regulation, the risks of fracking can be mitigated.
"It is the panel's opinion that, provided that the recommendations made in this report are adopted and implemented, not only should the risk of any harm be minimised to an acceptable level, in some instances, it can be avoided altogether," the draft report states.
But the inquiry panel's draft final report also recommends that before any production takes place, the Government must conduct baseline groundwater studies, which could take two to three years to complete.
Launching the inquiry's draft final report today, panel chairwoman Rachel Pepper said the inquiry would now hold more consultations before releasing its final report in March next year.
"The draft final report is as its title indicates — a draft. As such it may be expected to change following our next and final round of consultations," she said.
The Northern Territory Labor Government commissioned the inquiry as part of its moratorium on fracking.
The Government said it will use the inquiry's final report to decide whether to lift or keep its fracking ban.
Fracking has divided the Northern Territory Labor party and the issue is likely to be hotly debated at the party's NT annual conference due to be held early next year before the Government makes its decision on the moratorium.
Justice Pepper said it was not the inquiry's role to make a recommendation to the Government on the future of the moratorium.
"It is a matter for the Government to decide whether or not to lift the current moratorium, this report makes no such recommendation and will not do so," she said.
The inquiry's draft report makes almost 120 recommendations including changes to regulation, more environmental studies and a system for industry to fund the improved regulatory systems.
"If the recommendations are implemented and adopted in full, then the risks we have identified and analysed can be mitigated to acceptable levels," Justice Pepper said.

Justice Pepper said the recommendations for baseline groundwater studies and increased independence for the regulator were the most significant recommendations in the report.
In the Beetaloo Basin — one of the most prospective areas for shale gas in the Northern territory — there was currently not enough information on groundwater resources to assess the risk of excessive use of groundwater from fracking, the report revealed.
The inquiry recommends a Strategic Regional Environmental Baseline Assessment be done to provide more information on groundwater resources before any production can begin, although exploration would still be allowed during this phase.
Justice Pepper said baseline groundwater studies were critical.

"The community constantly told us that they were very concerned that those studies weren't in place and didn't exist and they do need to be in place and they do need to exist, and you need to know what you're dealing before you go forward," she said.
The draft report also recommends responsibility for regulating the industry be moved from the NT's Department of Primary Industry and Resources, which is also involved in industry promotion.
The panel said the dual roles appeared to be fuelling public concern the department was not independent.
"The panel has concluded that these two responsibilities must be separated to ensure that decision-making is independent," the report stated.
The inquiry has not calculated how much it would cost to implement the recommendations in full, but there would be some cost to industry.
The panel said it was recommending a "full cost recovery system", similar to South Australia's, where industry would contribute to the cost of better regulation such as the long-term monitoring of wells.
"Reforms cost money and it's the panel's very strong view that it ought not be the taxpayer who foots the bill for that, it should be industry," Justice Pepper said.

Whichever way you look at it — forward or backwards — Australia's housing boom is well and truly off the boil.

The latest evidence comes from the rear vision mirror of the Australian Bureau of Statistics' house price index which fell in the September quarter.
The slowdown was most marked in the investor hotspot of Sydney, while price inflation also appears to have peaked in Melbourne.
Looking forward there are obvious speed humps in the shape of further regulatory tightening on investor loans and weak wages growth.
On top of that, new apartments are banking up like a multi-car prang at peak hour, while a pull back in Chinese investment and falling auction clearance rates are hardly supportive of prices re-accelerating either.

Sydney house prices fell 1.4 per cent, while Melbourne eked out a modest gain — but well off the growth of recent years.
Hobart, which joined the housing express lane late, reported the strongest quarterly rise (+3.4 per cent), while Brisbane also accelerated modestly. Other markets were relatively flat over the quarter.
Nationally, the residential property price index was down 0.2 per cent.
"For anyone in doubt, the weakening in house prices in the third quarter all but confirms that Australia's housing boom is over," Capital Economics' Paul Dales said.
Mr Dales said more up-to-date indicators —such as monthly price series compiled by CoreLogic — suggested prices fell further in the fourth quarter and may decline next year.
That, as Mr Dales noted, represented a big change from a year ago when house prices were rising by around 3 per cent a quarter.
"The cut in the supply of credit to investors and the rises in investor loan rates caused by APRA's new rules in March that triggered this slowdown will probably continue to weigh on the market next year," Mr Dales said.
"They [the housing markets] are also more exposed to further falls in prices, as our house price to income ratios suggest prices there are well above their sustainable level."

However, while the brakes are being applied, does it mean a crash is imminent?
HSBC's Paul Bloxham argued national housing price growth would merely throttle-back from the double-digit rates of recent years to somewhere between 3 and 6 per cent next year.
"We do not expect a sharp decline in housing prices and expect only a modest decline in construction activity, as both are likely to be supported by strong population growth and low interest rates," Mr Bloxham said.
"A hard landing is possible, but we believe this would require a negative shock from abroad and a sharp rise in unemployment rate."
The view at Capital Economics was that rapid population growth may provide some comfort for those worried about a market crash, although it was unlikely to prevent prices doing anything much but going sideways for the next couple of years.
Mr Dales noted population growth only boosts house prices if extra demand is not met by additional construction.
"However, in recent years the number of new homes built has far exceeded the number required by the growing population. This overbuilding is much greater for apartments than houses," he said.

Mr Dales forecasted home building would continue to outstrip underlying demand for the next four years.
But more importantly, Mr Dales argued the cost and availability of credit, as well as the overall health of the economy, were bigger influences on house prices than population growth.
"Overall, population growth is unlikely to be strong enough over the next few years to absorb all the additional supply being built," he said.
"And with higher interest rates set to restrain demand from 2020, population growth may not prevent house prices from eventually falling, perhaps by around 10 per cent."
That might sound alarming, but then again it is more like a dint in the double-digit rises over recent years in Sydney and Melbourne markets than a calamitous write-off.

The Lowy family that made its fortune through Westfield shopping centres is selling out for $32.7 billion.

French property giant Unibail-Rodamco is acquiring the shopping mall juggernaut.
Westfield shareholders will receive $10.01 in cash and shares, per share — representing a huge premium to Westfield's shares, which last traded at $8.50.
Unibail-Rodamco will maintain the Westfield brand and the Lowy family will "remain committed to the success of the Group" and intends "to maintain a substantial investment in the Group."
Westfield chairman Frank Lowy said the deal was the result of the company's restructure that started in 2014.
An emotional Mr Lowy, speaking from Milan, said it was a day of mixed emotion but that he was certain he and his sons Peter and Steven had taken the right course.
"Why now? Why now because it is appropriate to do it now," Mr Lowy said.
"Firstly because it's a very good price for our shareholders and also from our point of view and the company I think we want to change our roles in the world … we would rather be investors than executives."
"As Peter said earlier, we have worked at Westfield for a combined 145 years," he said.
Unibail-Rodamco boss Christophe Cuvillier said the deal would create significant value for all shareholders.
"The acquisition of Westfield is a natural extension of Unibail-Rodamco's strategy of concentration, differentiation and innovation. It adds a number of new attractive retail markets in London and the wealthiest catchment areas in the United States."
The Lowy family will retain control of Westfield's retail technology platform, OneMarket, which will be spun off into a new company on the ASX, with Steven Lowy remaining as chairman.
Under the terms of the deal, the Lowy family will retain a significant holding in the merged operation, given two thirds of their $2.7 billion windfall will be delivered in stock.
Mr Lowy has engineered several major reshuffles of his corporate empire in the past decade, the most recent one his controversial move to hive off the Australasian assets into a separate listed company called Scentre in 2014.
Scentre, which is not in a trading halt, closed up 4.1 per cent at $4.35.
Mr Lowy and his two sons Steven and Peter, who are joint chief executives, abandoned most of their investment in the Australian malls, to concentrate on the international corporation.
Westfield Corporation runs 45 shopping centres and airport retail precincts in the US, UK and Italy, including the retail space in the new World Trade Centre in New York.
Westfield shares were worth $8.50 when they last traded, valuing the company at $17.6 billion on the ASX.
Joint chief executive Peter Lowy explained that real estate investment trusts globally had been treated harshly by investors in the past year and all were trading at a discount.
Given the large premium offered by Unibail, Peter Lowy said this deal allowed Westfield investors to make up that shortfall.
"When you look at the transaction and you look at the price that Unibail has agreed to pay, we have taken that gap from where the stock was trading back to the value of the company," he said.
Mr Lowy injected close to $180 million of his family's cash to top up his Westfield Corporation stake during the demerger, taking the family holding in the international group to a little under 10 per cent.
Since then, its shares have gyrated, recovering through 2015 and 2016 as the US economy began to improve.
But its stock has fallen nearly 10 per cent so far this year, leaving it with only modest gains since it split from the Australian operations.
Retailers across the United States are in what appears to be terminal decline as shoppers abandon traditional bricks and mortar while the digital revolution lays waste to traditional shopping.
That, in turn, has begun to harm shopping malls as retailers have struggled to pay rents with many closing down their outlets.
Thousands of mall-based stores have shut their doors across the US this year, including stalwarts such as JC Penney, Macy's, Sears and K-Mart reducing their physical footprint.
Smaller retailers such as Payless and RadioShack have been among the hardest hit.
That, in turn, has begun to affect employment. Until as recently as two years ago, shopping malls were providing America with 200,000 extra jobs a year, but that trend has now suddenly reversed.
According to the latest Bureau of Labour Statistics, the retail industry has lost an average of 9,000 jobs a month this year. This time last year, malls provided jobs growth of around 17,000 a month.

Unionists have been ordered to abandon a blockade at a major Melbourne port, after a court found the maritime union "outsourced" industrial action when it was ordered to stay away from the site.
A picket at Webb Dock has been blocking truck access for two weeks, forcing 1,000 shipping containers to remain stranded.
The Maritime Union of Australia (MUA) argues its members have been complying with a previous court order to stay 100 metres away from the site, and that the ongoing picket has been manned by community supporters.
But Supreme Court Justice Michael McDonald found the "balance of convenience" overwhelmingly proved that the strike action had been coordinated and encouraged by union officials.
"This is a self-styled group of 'hard' campaign activists coordinated by the Victorian Trades Council," Justice McDonald said.
He ordered the MUA, Construction Forestry Mining and Energy Union (CFMEU) and Trades Hall secretary Luke Hilakari to stay 100 metres from the site, and to allow free passage at the port until a future trial.
He said there was a strong inference that the "MUA has outsourced to other unions, coordinated by the Victorian Trades Hall Council, the task of maintaining an illegal picket".
"The conduct of the picket has been characterised by a high degree of organisation," Justice McDonald said.

The court heard strike action began after a casual worker had their employment terminated because the worker did not have mandatory clearance.
But the MUA argued the worker had been targeted because he was a union member.
The MUA had previously been ordered to stay away from the site from December 1.
Justice McDonald has now extended that order, pointing to the prevalence of union flags and memorabilia at the picket line as evidence of union influence.
The court also heard video footage showed CFMEU organiser John Sekta, accompanied by other union officials, telling picketers on December 8, "everything we have here today is by breaking the law and taking industrial action".
"There's no question that members of the public have the right to peaceful assembly," Justice McDonald told the court.
"What they do not have the right to do and what has been occurring … is to prevent the plaintiff going about its lawful business.
"There has been an intention to injure the plaintiff.
"The plaintiff has suffered loss or damage."
VICT is suing the MUA for economic loss and damages as a result of the strike.
The court heard the MUA had a longstanding dispute with VICT about an enterprise bargaining agreement.
In State Parliament today, the Opposition tried to attack the Andrews Government for failing to reign in union allies.
But Premier Daniel Andrews said his Government had offered to act as a mediator between the union and VICT, but had been rebuffed by the company.
Mr Andrews also lashed out at the Coalition for running a fear campaign about medical supplies being left languishing on the docks.
It had been reported that EpiPens, which are used to treat allergy sufferers for anaphylactic shock, were among the goods that were unable to be unloaded from shipping containers.
Mr Andrews said advice provided to the Government from EpiPen manufacturers said that they were actually flown into Victoria, and did not come via the port.

It might not be a crisis in confidence yet, but Australian business is becoming increasingly pessimistic about its immediate future.

The respected NAB monthly business survey reported a sharp decline in both conditions and confidence in November.
While the fall in conditions index was expected after a surprise surge in October, the NAB survey noted business confidence has experienced a "notable downward trend … since around the middle of the year".
"We expected to see last month's spike in business conditions unwound fairly quickly as it both came as a bit of a surprise, and was also out of sorts with what we were seeing in some of the other leading indicators from the survey, such as forward orders," NAB chief economist Alan Oster.
"We are paying close attention to what now appears to be a downward trend in business confidence as that could naturally have some implications for decisions around hiring and investment."
The deterioration in conditions was widespread across industries, although most are still at fairly elevated levels.
Retail is the obvious exception, slipping back into negative territory in November.
"The subdued conditions in retail have been a major concern for some time now, and that was manifested in a very disappointing outcome for household consumption in the third quarter national accounts," Mr Oster said.
"We may see a bit of a rebound in the fourth quarter, but retailers do not appear to be seeing it."
While retail's spirits are sinking, the construction sector continues to be buoyant and was the only industry where conditions did not fall last month.
Mr Oster said the large residential property pipeline was still supporting the sector, but there was evidence of increased infrastructure spending and a lift in non-residential construction activity as well.
The gains in sales and profitability made in October were largely reversed last month, while measures relating to employment remained steady.
With concerns about rising energy costs easing in importance, businesses reported rising wages as now being their primary concern.
"We saw some tentative signs of higher wages in the survey, although that does appear to be weighing on the confidence of some firms as well," Mr Oster said.
The survey evidence stands in contrast to official measures of wages, which have yet to show much improvement from multi-decade lows.

Wages were up just 2 per cent over the year to September according to the most recent figures from ABS.
The leading indicator of forward orders was generally positive across all sectors, including retail.
On the negative side, final product prices slipped further behind input costs which points to another weak quarter of inflation coming up.
"Prices are rising the most in mining, while retail and personal services prices are the softest — a reflection of the cautious spending behaviour by consumers," the survey noted.
Across the states, New South Wales continues to enjoy the most upbeat business conditions, while Western Australia remains the most subdued.

SA Best leader Nick Xenophon has blasted the SA Government's newly opened O-Bahn bus tunnel, declaring the $160 million spent on the project would have been better used on grade separation of roads.
The bus tunnel, which opened yesterday, is designed to save three-and-a-half minutes for bus commuters travelling between the north-eastern suburbs and the CBD.
Mr Xenophon is running as a candidate in the north-eastern suburbs seat of Hartley, which straddles the O-Bahn at Campbelltown.
But this morning, he told a business breakfast he was no fan of the project, which was announced in the lead-up to the 2014 election.
"I live in the north-eastern suburbs. I'm within walking distance of the Paradise Interchange and catch the O-Bahn, but I cannot understand or accept the thinking or the processes that went behind this $160 million project," Mr Xenophon said.
Mr Xenophon said Labor's commitment to build the tunnel was a highly political decision which did not undergo even a veneer of appropriate process.
"Talk about tunnel vision," he said.
"It's not just the cost, or the ripping up of the parklands that has concerned so many. It is the almost wilful blindness to alternatives that could have delivered an equivalent outcome at vastly reduced costs that really irks me.
"For $160 million I suggest many more commuters could have benefited from reduced congestion and improved traffic flow through, for instance, grade separation of roads."

Mr Xenophon said the Government should also have considered other solutions, such as gated bus stops along Grenfell Street in the city, which would save time by allowing commuters to pre-validate their bus tickets.
"Whatever cost benefit analysis the Government did for the tunnel seems to ignore that reality that all O-Bahn buses now have to travel along Grenfell Street," he said.
"The one-third of buses that went down North Terrace will have those passengers inconvenienced, taking more time to get to their destination, more time in many cases than the savings the tunnel delivered."
Mr Xenophon said the O-Bahn tunnel decision was emblematic of a broken system, and that his party SA Best would push for the creation of a new independent body to plan infrastructure projects.
The Liberal Party has already pledged to create such a body, to be known as Infrastructure South Australia.
But while the Liberal proposal would see the body report to Government, SA Best's policy would require the Government of the day to seek parliamentary approval to over-rule Infrastructure SA on projects.
"SA Best would demand that Infrastructure SA would have more teeth, that it would be a statutory authority, not a mere advisory board as the opposition proposes," he said.

The state's Civil Contractors Federation also supported the idea, rejecting suggestions an independent authority would hold up building projects.
"Infrastructure South Australia would be the body to review projects to see if they could have been done better, more economically, and indeed deliver productivity for South Australia," CEO Phillip Sutherland said.
"If the agency is properly resourced, they could get through the work. At the end of the day, what South Australia needs is a long-term infrastructure plan of 10 or 20 years."
Mr Sutherland said the current situation meant the state could find itself with "no shovel-ready projects when money becomes available, including from the Federal Government — which has been the case on more than one occasion".
Mr Xenophon said his party would push for Infrastructure SA to make public recommendations on the cost-benefit of projects, procurement methods and industry participation.
"At a cost of $10 million a year for a well-resourced watchdog, this would be a tiny premium to pay for what would in effect be an insurance policy against future infrastructure debacles," he said.
Mr Xenophon ridiculed the Opposition Leader Steven Marshall's pronouncement that the Liberal Party would not enter an agreement with his party to form government.
"Steven's vehement denials that he would work with SA Best remind me of that immortal line from Shakespeare from no less than Hamlet — he 'doth protest too much, methinks'."

Apple has confirmed it's reached a deal to buy Shazam, the UK-based app that lets people use the microphone on their mobile to identify songs.
No price has been given for the acquisition, but technology news website TechCrunch reported on Friday that a deal could be worth as much as $US400 million ($531.1 million).
However, that's far short of the most recent $1 billion valuation for the privately held company.
Apple said Shazam would be a "natural fit" with its Apple Music streaming service and it would help users discover new songs.
Apple Music has 27 million users and competes against Spotify, which has 60 million users.
Apple said Shazam's team would be joining its company.
In a statement, Apple spokesman Tom Neumayr said Shazam "is used by hundreds of millions of people around the world, across multiple platforms".
"We have exciting plans in store, and we look forward to combining with Shazam upon approval of today's agreement," he said.
According to tech journalist Micah Singleton, writing at The Verge, Shazam can help Apple in a number of ways — not just by improving Apple Music, but also by stopping Shazam from referring its users to Spotify.
"Also, Shazam's music and sound recognition, which is already integrated with Siri, could gain a deeper integration with iOS, much like Google has done with its song recognition feature on the Pixel," he wrote.
Larry Dignan agrees Apple has bought knowledge that goes beyond its music service.
"What Apple really bought with Shazam is a team that's expert at training models, developing algorithms and managing data," he wrote at ZDNet.
"Shazam is about music — for now. However, that same modelling expertise could apply to many other tasks."
Apple did not elaborate on its plans, but the company will not be able to make any major changes to Shazam until it secures regulatory approval.
Shazam is also available on Android-based devices, but Apple did not say whether it would keep the Android version available.
Shazam ended support for a version of its software that runs on Microsoft Windows PCs earlier this year.

The Dow Jones and S&P 500 ended its day at record highs, boosted by gains in the energy and technology sectors.

Apple shares jumped 1.8 per cent after the company confirmed it had reached a deal to acquire Shazam Entertainment.
Shazam is a music-recognition app which allows users to identify which song is playing — by pointing their smartphones at the radio, speakers or other audio source.
Although Apple did not give a price for its takeover, technology news website TechCrunch reported the deal on Friday with a price of as much as $US400 million ($531.1 million).
Apple said Shazam would be a "natural fit" with its Apple Music streaming service and it would help users discover new songs.
Currently, Apple Music has 27 million users and competes against Spotify, which has 60 million users.
In a statement, Apple spokesman Tom Neumayr said Shazam "is used by hundreds of millions of people around the world, across multiple platforms".

Seven of the 11 major S&P sectors traded higher, led by technology and energy stocks.
However, financial, consumer staple, and industrial stocks were the weakest performers.
Cryptocurrency-related stocks rose sharply as interest in bitcoin continues to rise.
For example, shares of Marathon Patent and Riot Blockchain rose 42.9 and 45.5 per cent respectively.

The Fed is due to announce its decision on Thursday, and the likelihood of a rate increase is 90 per cent, according to CME Group's Fedwatch tool.
The Australian share market is expected to open higher today.
Oil and copper prices gained overnight, which helped to boost US-listed shares of BHP and Rio Tinto — and should bode well for their ASX-listed shares.
In local economic news, NAB will release its monthly business survey, which will reveal how business conditions and confidence performed in November.

However, the local currency has slipped considerably against the New Zealand dollar (-0.8pc).

An Australian chemical manufacturer has rejected calls for a ban or tightening of restrictions around the use of a highly toxic herbicide which poisoned a young man with autism on the New South Wales Central Coast.
Damien Terry, 21, accidently drank the commercial weedkiller — known as paraquat — from a soft drink bottle he found in a disabled toilet at the Mangrove Mountain sports complex in August.
Doctors initially gave him about 12 hours to live but he "miraculously" recovered after two weeks in Gosford Hospital and his family now wants the deadly chemical banned.
Kendon Chemical is one of many Australian companies that use paraquat, an imported chemical, in their herbicide products.
Kendon's managing director Chris Storey has defended the safeguards around its use, provided all instructions are followed properly.
"There are controls — it's an S7 which means the poison must be kept under lock and key," he said.
Mr Storey also expressed surprise when he was told how easy it was for the ABC to get access to a large bottle of the substance.
"I'm surprised that happened  — the reseller would have asked for a permit if the purchaser was not known to them," he said.
"To purchase it you need an agricultural chemical users permit for which you have had to do a day's training unless you're known to the seller.
"It has to contain an emetic, a stench agent and a blue dye. An emetic make you vomit and this gentleman who ingested the product from a coke bottle, mind you — he was vomiting … it obviously was working there and maybe that's why he survived."

Paraquat has been under review for 20 years by the Australian regulator, with a determination due next year.
Mr Storey has acknowledged it was banned in more than 30 countries worldwide but is adamant Australia should not go down this path.
"I'm not sure the countries that have been banned have the broadacre farming we have here in Australia, noting that Australian agricultural grain growing is one of the most efficient in the world and these products help that efficiency," he said.
He has also rejected warnings by Newcastle University environmental contamination expert Professor Ravi Naidu that people should stay away from an area for between 15 to 20 days after being sprayed with the weedkiller.
"Paraquat breaks down when it's exposed to the dirt because it binds the clay very tightly … so 20 days — he doesn't know what he's talking about," he said.
"I wouldn't have children playing on it the same day.
"You'd wait until the next day because by that time it's been absorbed by the plant and or it's dripped into the dirt."
But he admitted it should only be used for commercial farming purposes — not in public areas.

Aboriginal groups are demanding concrete quotas for Indigenous employment on the Federal Government's $10 billion inland rail project, saying it's "not good enough" no targets have been set.

The Melbourne-to-Brisbane freight rail line has been touted as "nation building" and is expected to create 5,500 direct jobs in the construction phase, which will begin early next year.
One-fifth of the shire's population is Aboriginal.
"We've been burnt too many times … if it is in writing, well, they've got to do it," Mr Munro said.
"They generally come with workers themselves instead of employing locals."
"We would welcome that number and support that number, if not a little bit higher, depending on the communities that this corridor is going through," said Roy Ah-See, chairman of the NSW Aboriginal Land Council.

However, the Government-owned builder of the multi-billion-dollar project, the Australian Rail Track Corporation (ARTC), has told the ABC it has no targets for Aboriginal employment.
"We have not set any targets at all but we are very keen to make sure we get maximum participation from the local communities, and in particular Aboriginal communities, on the [rail] corridor," ARTC CEO John Fullerton said.
Mr Fullerton said the ARTC already employed about 50 Indigenous people nationwide, which was 2.7 per cent of its workforce.
"We are a large employer of Indigenous people in the company today and it's certainly going to be our priority to employ as many as we can in those local communities," he said.
Mr Ah-See said that wasn't good enough.

"They need to set some targets … council would be looking for a briefing sooner rather than later," he said.
"For far too long now Aboriginal people have been the last people to go to when it comes to employment or economic development opportunities."
He said the percentage employed was, "a bit small at the moment" and his council would reach out to the ARTC in the near future.
"[We want to] basically encourage the ARTC to not see us as a barrier, but rather a solution … and forming a relationship and a partnership," Mr Ah-See said.

One of those people is Jason Saunders. The 22-year-old A-grade football player has been looking for work since last November.
His last job was on the construction of a solar farm, and he's very keen to get work on the inland rail project.
He said any new jobs for local people would be a major boost.
"It would be really good for them [locals] to get out of town, do work, instead of messing around," he said. "Construction … anything would be good."

The manager of the north-west branch of the AES, Cathy Duncan, a Gomeroi woman, agreed targets were crucial.
Ms Duncan, who is also a founder of the national agency, which is funded by Prime Minister and Cabinet, said "warm and fluffy" rhetoric didn't cut it.

"I think Aboriginal people are sick of the tick-a-box in government contracts, or the goodwill around, 'We are going to employ Indigenous people'," Ms Duncan said.
"I think into the future it is about having quotas, having agreements, and then having monitoring of and accountability within those agreements."
But she said forewarning and consultation with the ARTC was crucial to ensuring local Aboriginal people had time to attain skills.
"If we plan and have those consultations and conversations a lot earlier in the piece, it gives us the opportunity to be able to train and develop our own people to be able to take up opportunities that could be given to them," she said.
Ms Duncan said there were already courses available that could be used to start training people, including specific rail courses her organisation had been involved with in Dubbo and Tamworth.
Inland rail's advocates have labelled it a "nation-building project" and "the Snowy Hydro Scheme for the modern era".
"No way in the world it's a nation-building program if they're not talking to the Aboriginal people," Mr Munro said.
Ms Duncan agreed, adding: "I think that what would have to happen to make it truly nation building is see the inclusion, see real outcomes, and see the Aboriginal people participating in the workforce and on job sites.
"If not, it is a nice fluffy word, and it makes everybody feel good, but part of the nation is making sure we include first-nation people if we're going to build a nation."

A controversial hazardous waste storage facility and salt mine planned for Central Australia has been given the tick of approval by the NT's Environment Protection Authority.

If built, the Chandler facility would be the first repository of its kind in Australia and the nation's largest hazardous waste surface storage facility, storing up to 9 per cent of Australia's 5.6 million tonnes of hazardous waste.
EPA NT chairman Paul Vogel said Australia had a waste storage problem and the size of this project could make it a safer option for storing hazardous waste.
"Having hazardous waste stored in a deep geological repository and subject to stringent regulation is a better environmental solution for hazardous waste than storing it in all sorts of facilities around Australia subject to unknown and perhaps inadequate regulation," he said.
"So I think it's better to have it in one spot that we all know about and tightly regulated and well managed."
The company behind the proposed facility, Tellus Holdings, wants to build about 120 kilometres south of Alice Springs.
But the nearby Indigenous community of Titjikala — about 15 kilometres from the proposed site — remains divided about the benefit and risks of such a project.
Some residents fear the toxic waste could leak and poison the land and its water supply, whereas some support the project, its proposed job creation for Aboriginal people and the paving of the dirt road between Alice Springs and Titjikala.
The Arid Lands Environment Centre's assistant manager, Nicole Pietsch, said her organisation still had a number of concerns about the project and would continue to work with Titjikala residents.
"We do have some real concerns around the fact that this type of hazardous waste storage facility has never been tried in Australia before, we have concerns around the monitoring, compliance and also the enforcement," she said.
"There's examples in France and Germany where these kinds of waste storage facilities have existed and that there's accidents that have happened and then there's a huge environmental and financial cost to clean that up.
"We acknowledge the concerns of some Titjikala residents who don't feel like they have been properly informed and who also have concerns about how this project may impact on cultural responsibilities of looking after country."
Dr Vogel said the EPA had undertaken a very rigorous assessment of the potential risks and approved the Tellus Holdings project on the condition it met the EPA's 19 recommendations.
"Subject to all those controls, there should be no level of significant impact to water resources or biodiversity or air quality," he said.
"This is the first national deep geological repository for hazardous waste that's been undertaken in Australia so that being the case this was subject to a very rigorous impact assessment.
"There would need to be, over time, a very high level of regulatory oversight to ensure that this facility indeed manages those identified potential impacts and risks."

Dr Vogel said the recommendations included an annual independent and publicly disclosed audit at the company's expense, ensuring the waste met the waste acceptance criteria, a safety assessment to ensure the facility was built and operated with best practice and an independent financial assessment of the company.
Tellus Holdings' managing director, Duncan van der Merwe, said while the facility was a new concept to Australia, it has been widely used internationally.
"I'm pleased to see and hear that in the broader community there's an acceptance that there's a waste problem out in Australia," he said.
"We do need to manage our waste materials differently and there's an acceptance that we should view waste as a valuable source and we should find ways to recycle, recover and create more jobs as a result.
"And … on the mining side, diversity of revenue creates long-term stable mines, creates long-term stable economies."
The Chandler Mine project is expected to create 270 jobs during the three years of construction and 180 ongoing jobs after that, with a target of 10 per cent Indigenous employment.
But the project is still subject to NT Government approval and the company would not give any indication of when construction would be likely to start.

Trucks have stopped trying to enter a Melbourne shipping terminal after union workers barricading the dock knocked out the teeth of a driver earlier this month, the Supreme Court of Victoria has heard.
The Victorian International Container Terminal (VICT) has been shut down for two weeks after Maritime Union of Australia (MUA) members walked off the job.
The VICT is currently seeking an order from the court to ban the MUA, the CFMEU and Trades Hall Secretary Luke Hilakari from coming within 100 metres of the site, and from encouraging other union members to picket.
The dispute has been ongoing for 13 days, forcing precious cargo to be diverted to Adelaide and then taken by road to Melbourne.
Lawyers for the VICT told the court the serious assault of the truck driver occurred on December 2.
But the MUA representatives questioned the veracity of the attack, saying that the court had not been presented with evidence of who the driver was.
The VICT claim that no trucks had tried to enter the facility since the alleged attack.

The Webb Dock blockade has left 1,000 shipping containers stranded, including two shipments of EpiPens, according to the Victorian Transport Association.
Mr Hilakari told the ABC the union asked the VICT to come and retrieve the containers, but they were yet to do so.
He also said he had doubts as to whether there were actually EpiPens at the stevedore.
The issue on the docks came to a head when an audit revealed 22 workers did not have a Maritime Security Identification Card (MSIC), which lets workers into secure areas.
According to the union, the one worker who had taken the company to Fair Work had his employment terminated.
Outside the court, the Victorian Transport Association's Peter Anderson said the situation was "holding Victorians to ransom".
He called on the union to go through the proper processes and come to the table to negotiate.
"That's exactly why we have a Fair Work Commission," he told the ABC.
"That worker in the first instance became ineligible to work on the wharf, so now they're looking for a re-classification of an individual to maintain a work status as a casual.
"There's a bit of inconsistency in what they're looking for, however there's always middle ground in any negotiation."

Earlier, Mr Hilakari told the ABC that the worker has since received authorisation to work on the docks.
He said the picketing would most likely continue until the worker was reinstated.
"He's been authorised to be on the docks, so there's no reason for him not to get back there," he said.
"If he goes back to work, then the strike will be over and things will be moving back from the dock, that's my strong feeling that I get from unions and people who are community supporters down there."
Workers are granted MSIC clearance after they have been cleared by the AFP and ASIO as not being a threat to the maritime or offshore industry.
In a statement, MUA Deputy Secretary Will Tracey said the worker had to take one extra step to have his clearance approved, due to a previous conviction.
"VICT management and its supporters made the claim several times that this worker had his appeal for an MSIC rejected, not once but twice," he said.
"When the truth is that he has held a two-year MSIC card on several occasions since receiving an assault conviction more than 20 years ago."
Mr Hilakari called on the state and federal governments to intervene.
"[VICT] have automated the docks, and they're paying lower wages than industry standards, and they're also targeting union members … this issue needs to be resolved," he said.

A spokesperson for the Victorian Government said they were monitoring the impact the situation had on supplies.
"The Government has repeatedly offered to bring the parties together to help them resolve this dispute — including an offer to bring in Industrial Relations Victoria as a mediator — and that offer remains open," the spokesperson said.
"The matter will be heard by the Fair Work Commission tomorrow and we are hopeful this will bring an end to the dispute."

Clive Palmer has faced another federal court grilling from liquidators of his failed company Queensland Nickel, who say he failed to meet a judge's order to produce key financial documents.
And Mr Palmer's Twitter account — already the cause of legal controversy — posted a bizarre cartoon just as the former federal MP was testifying from the witness box.

An examination hearing on Monday heard Mr Palmer had not produced written records detailing multi-million-dollar transfers from Queensland Nickel, which liquidators alleged he used as a "cash cow" to pay other bills.
At 2:40pm (AEST), while Mr Palmer was facing questioning by a lawyer for liquidators, his Twitter account posted a cartoon containing a self-referential joke.
A judge last week ordered Mr Palmer to give an affidavit by Wednesday evening explaining a December 1 tweet from his account made during a federal court hearing he had failed to turn up for.
Mr Palmer, dressed in a sports coat and T-shirt, did not appear to have access to any electronic device in court on Monday.
The court last week ordered Mr Palmer to produce financial documents from his flagship company Mineralogy under threat of contempt charges and a raid by liquidators on his offices.
Mr Palmer told the court his staff had "produced the documents we have".
When John Peden, a barrister for liquidators, raised the prospect of a new production order for missing transaction records, Mr Palmer said: "I don't believe in wasting my people's time, just because you're funded by the Commonwealth and the Chinese Government."
Mr Palmer gave some unusual explanations for why few people in his business empire knew of financial details apart from himself.
He said transaction details were frequently not made accessible to accounts staff because "we have our phone lines tapped by the Chinese Government".
He said former Queensland Nickel chief financial officer Daren Wolfe would not know of recent debt levels in Mr Palmer's enterprise as "he has been judging the world gymnastics championships in Europe".
Mr Peden repeatedly upbraided Mr Palmer for "giving speeches" instead of answering questions.
He put it to Mr Palmer that his flagship company Mineralogy used Queensland Nickel as a "cash cow" to pay its bills.
Mr Palmer at first said this was "wrong" and that Queensland Nickel had "no money of its own" and this belonged to two holding companies.
Asked if he was aware only Queensland Nickel had a bank account, Mr Palmer said: "I can't recall."
Mr Peden responded: "Really? You appreciate you're under oath, Mr Palmer?"
Mr Palmer then answered the same question about using Queensland Nickel to pay Mineralogy's bills by saying he would have to "get advice".
His solicitor Sam Iskander stood to remind Mr Palmer he could claim privilege against self-incrimination before answering.
The hearings are examining Mr Palmer's role in the 2016 collapse of Queensland Nickel with debts of $300 million and leaving almost 800 people jobless.
Liquidators are targeting Mr Palmer in separate legal action to try to claw back more than $200 million they allege he recklessly drained from Queensland Nickel while acting as a "shadow director".
Mr Palmer has denied all wrongdoing and is defending the action.

The use of social media to "pressure" insurers into paying out claims is costing companies millions and driving up premiums, according to the peak-body for the insurance industry.
The Insurance Council of Australia's Campbell Fuller said dissatisfied customers taking their gripes of rejected claims to Twitter and Facebook can cause a number of problems, including reputational harm for insurers.
"It can have an impact on the cost of acquiring a new customer, or moving a customer from one insurer to another," Mr Fuller said.
"And because those costs are embedded in the business, they can affect the premium that customers are paying. So it does have some impact.
"When a company is trying to sell a product to a customer, it falls down the Google rankings and therefore it's harder for a new customer to see that particular company."
Mr Fuller said customer pressure over a claim can sometimes lead to payouts where they are not due.
"Other factors involved are that we have customers complaining on social media or using social media to try and leverage an insurance company," he said.
"And insurance company may feel under pressure to pay a claim even if that claim is not fair. Even if that claim is actually not legitimate or only partially legitimate.
"Simply because when there are issues and disputes, the costs of not paying the claim can actually be higher than the cost of actually paying the claim."
But some social media experts are sceptical of the claims, saying insurance companies should be using social media to listen to their customers.

Facebook and Twitter are often the places people go when they want to vent their displeasure.
Mark Pesche, a digital culture expert at the University of Sydney, said online accountability had actually improved customer service across many businesses.
"Any company that is so afraid of social media, it means that they haven't been interacting with their customers and so they're feeling like they're being attacked by them," he said.
"That's probably a sign to those businesses that they need to interact with their customers more continuously and more regularly so that they can actually put those problems to bed.
"Social media is how customers voice their opinions all the time, and any company that isn't listening to it isn't doing their job and also isn't getting the important feedback."
But Dr Pesche said while social media had made businesses more accountable, it was something that should not always be trusted.
"You actually have to be super careful because sometimes people will post things that are false," he said.
"Like a competitor will plant something, and that will then be a way of undermining a competitor. So you have to regard these things a little suspiciously."

Traditional owners in central Queensland say they could have lost all of their native title rights if they did not negotiate with Adani on a proposed coal mine in central Queensland.
The Native Title Tribunal registered an Indigenous Land Use Agreement (ILUA) on Friday with the Wangan and Jagalingou People (W&J) for the Carmichael mine, north-west of Clermont.
An ILUA is an indication of traditional owners' support for the project, but part of the group has opposed the mine.
W&J spokesman Patrick Malone said seven of the 12 native title claimants supported the mine, but a minority had taken legal action in an attempt to block the project.
Mr Malone said the Queensland coordinator-general pressured the claimants two years ago to come to the negotiating table.
"Each of us applicants got a letter from the coordinator-general saying because we weren't willing to engage with certain people they were preparing to start proceedings to extinguish native title against all Wangan Jagalingou Country," he said.
"The seven of us decided it's all about having our native title recognised so we went back to Adani and said we're willing to negotiate ILUA with you."
Mr Malone said most of the claimants who supported the mine lived in Indigenous communities like Woorabinda and Cherbourg, while many of the opponents of the project lived in capital cities.
"Mainly in Brisbane from what I can can see, these people that are doing that are sitting in their homes in the luxury of air conditioning that's probably fuelled by coal fire power stations," he said.
He said Adani had guaranteed that local Indigenous people would get at least seven-and-a-half per cent of jobs at the mine.
"So it's not only giving Adani approval, some of the things that are coming back to Wangan and Jagalingou People besides a yearly compensation payment or a royalty, there's the ability for us to participate in business projects," he said.
"One of the things they've offered to W&J people is to operate the bus service that will move around the camp and between the camp and Clermont.
"We've got Downer EDI, who are going to build the mine, they are going to take 75 Aboriginal people on as soon as they start."
Mr Malone said he felt he did not have any choice but to negotiate.
"Most of the environment approvals and the other approvals that Adani needed had already been granted and were in place and the only thing outstanding was to do ours [approval by native title claimants], and I along with the other six really didn't want to lose our native title," he said.
"And even at this stage, because there's a split in the applicant, that still might be a possibility — I don't know."
W&J claimants who opposed the mine said they planned to continue legal action to challenge the land use agreement.

Top Enders forking out for sky-high airfares will get the chance to air their frustration when a Senate inquiry visits Darwin next year.
The Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee is calling for first-hand experiences of flight prices in regional, rural and remote locations and will scrutinise the factors that determine pricing.
"It's looking at regional routes and seeing what can be done from a federal perspective, from a regulatory perspective, to try and improve our connectivity," Member for Solomon Luke Gosling said.
"We understand there's costs for business, but what we need to do is accurately see what are reasonable and fair costs for business, and then see what is — I don't know any other way to say it — businesses taking advantage of their monopoly."
Flight prices are often cited as a key deterrent to settling down in the Northern Territory, where airfares can cost interstate travellers hundreds of dollars more than east coast flights of the same distance.
Mr Gosling, who worked to ensure the inquiry would visit Darwin, told ABC Radio Darwin's Richard Margetson that scorned Territorians should offer their experiences to the committee.
"Regional airlines and airfares are a cause of concern because we live in the best part of Australia up here, but one of the things that affects our connectivity, not only with family and friends but from business, is the cost of getting around," he said.
Although it is unknown whether a hearing will also take place in Alice Springs, written submissions are already being received from residents in the outback capital.

"It's certainly something that a lot of us are pushing for and have been since the inquiry was announced a couple of weeks ago," Tourism Central Australia's Dale McIver said.
One submission complains of paying $330 for a one-way flight to visit family in Sydney over Christmas.
The ABC has previously revealed that residents frequently make the 450-kilometre journey for the cheaper airfares out of Yulara rather than flying out of Alice Springs.
"I'm off to Perth next week — $800 one-way. It hurts. I understand," Ms McIver said.
"But what we really need to make sure that this inquiry hears from is real business cases. That's what they're really going to stand up and listen to."
She said businesses often hesitated to send staff to interstate training sessions and enticing labourers to take up work in Alice Springs was difficult; the two issues having a domino effect on the town's economy.
"Just because we're a minority voice because there aren't as many of us living out here as in the big cities, we're just as important passengers."
Mr Gosling was optimistic that the inquiry could effect real change.
"I think it's up to the community to make sure our experiences are relayed to the committee so they have a good understanding," he said.
"Obviously also it's an opportunity for the airports and airlines to justify the amount they charge us for flying in and out of the Top End."

"At the end of the day, the Government can't force [airlines] to say, 'your flights are too expensive, you must change them'," Ms McIver said.
"However, hopefully some political pressure that comes out of this inquiry will make the airlines stand up and realise you can't take it out on regional Australia."
This is not the first Senate inquiry looking into the cost of airfares in the Northern Territory.
In July, the Joint Standing Committee on Northern Australia visited Alice Springs, Darwin and Yulara as part of its inquiry into stimulating northern Australian tourism.
While the inquiry is yet to hand down its recommendations, tourism bodies have said increasing the number of discount domestic airlines would unlock tourism in the Northern Territory.
Darwin International Airport's submission also called for the Passenger Movement Charge, a flat rate tax of about $60 applied to all passengers, to be reduced.
Earlier in the year Qantas announced discounted airfares of up to 30 per cent for some regional locations in Queensland and Western Australia.
The inquiry is slated to visit Darwin in March.

Optus will compensate more than 8,700 customers who were misled about the speed of their plans.
The telco also admitted it is likely to have breached the Australian Consumer Law (ACL) by providing speeds slower than what it advertised between September 2015 and June 2017.
These slower speeds were due to "technical limitations" on the customers' fibre to the node (FTTN) or fibre to the building (FTTB) NBN connections, said the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC).
Optus' most expensive "Boost Max" plan was supposed to reach maximum download speeds of up to 100 megabits per second (Mbps), and maximum upload speeds of up to 40 Mbps (100/40 Mbps).
The ACCC has revealed almost half the FTTN (fibre to the node) customers on that plan (5,430 people) were unable to reach such speeds.

Furthermore, 21 per cent of customers (2,337) could not even reach half of that speed.
"Worryingly, many affected Optus FTTN customers could not even receive the maximum speed of a lower-tier plan," ACCC chairman Rod Sims said.
"This is a concerning trend we have seen throughout the industry and we are working to fix this."
As for its next fastest plan (50/20 Mbps), more than a quarter of FTTN customers (1,519) on a 50/20 plan could not receive that top speed.
The number of Optus NBN customers who got less than they bargained for pales in comparison to Telstra's.
"Optus is the second major internet provider we have taken action against for selling broadband speeds they could not deliver to their customers," Mr Sims said.
Back in early November, Telstra admitted 42,000 of its customers were getting slower-than-expected speeds — almost five times higher than Optus' tally.
Optus has provided a court-enforceable undertaking to the ACCC, detailing the remedies it will provide to affected customers.

These remedies include refunds, changing speed plans, discounts, and customers being able to exit from contracts without paying a penalty.
Optus will also be required to check with customers, within four weeks of connecting them to a new NBN plan, to see whether they are receiving the speeds they paid for.
If during that check, the customers are getting less than the advertised speeds, the telco will need to notify them and offer remedies.
However, the ACCC warned that customers may not get faster speeds if they exit their Optus contracts and move to another internet provider.
Optus will contact its affected consumers by email or letter by March 2.

Australia's five-year mining investment slump is almost over, and that means the resources sector will soon start adding to growth again instead of dragging on the economy.
The good news is delivered in the Mining in Australia 2017 to 2032 report from forecasters at BIS Oxford Economics.
The forecaster's associate director for mining, Adrian Hart, said mining production is likely to grow 5.5 per cent in the current financial year, with maintenance spending also on the rise and the investment decline winding down.
"For the first time in several years we can say that the outlook for mining is positive, rather than negative," he said.
"We can start talking about mining being positive for the economy, not just in production terms but in investment terms as well."
Mining exploration spending fell to its lowest level in a decade last financial year, at $2.9 billion, but BIS Oxford Economics expects that to recover to $4 billion per annum over the next five years.
"We're seeing higher prices across the board and that's already stimulating that exploration work, and we expect it to really strengthen over the next few years," he said.

Mr Hart said increased exploration is already starting to lead to rising investment in new projects, at least outside of the LNG export sector.
"When you look outside of oil and gas, mining investment is actually starting to rise," he said.
"You're starting to see the next round of mining operations start to get developed, whether it be in coal, in iron ore, in copper, in gold, in other metals, we're seeing the investment starting to come through."

However, it will take longer for Australia to overcome the drag from hundreds of billions of dollars spent on LNG export facilities over the past decade.
From a peak of $95.9 billion in 2012-13, the report predicts investment in resource sector projects will bottom at $28.4 billion next financial year, before rising back to $38.4 billion over the next few years.
However, Adrian Hart said the broader Australian economic impact of the remaining investment decline is likely to be small.
"The downturn in LNG investment is probably still going to take another 12 to 18 months, and that's going to make total mining investment continue to fall," he said.
"It is highly import intensive and we believe that actually the impact on the Australian economy from that perspective will be negligible."
The BIS Oxford Economics forecast do not factor in the possibility of Adani's Carmichael coal mine, as the analysts do not believe the project is likely to go ahead.

A leading Tasmanian economist has recommended selling off government-owned assets to fund future infrastructure spending, as the state's peak social services body warns that people must come before profits.

In the Tasmania Chamber of Commerce and Industry (TCCI) report, Saul Eslake said the Government should consider offloading Tasports, TasNetworks, Aurora Energy or the Motor Accidents Insurance Board.
Mr Eslake said sales would allow the state to borrow more money to fund investment on "rigorously selected infrastructure".
He said it would also allow Tasmania to offset some of its unfunded superannuation liability.
"The economic and social challenges facing Tasmania, over the next four years and beyond, cannot be addressed by a Government which seeks a mandate for doing nothing more than 'minding the store' - however competently they do that," he said.
"This is a moment in Tasmania's history where those who seek to shape its future should be imaginative and bold, rather than cautious or timid."
The report found Tasmania's economy had "grown strongly" in specific areas, including:
The report found business confidence "remained high", with Tasmanian businesses "more supportive of State Government policies than anywhere else in Australia".

Mr Eslake said Tasmania's property market was "doing very well", with prices statewide also rising, although "not as rapidly as in Hobart".
"Residential property prices in Hobart are now rising more rapidly than in any other capital city and selling more quickly than for a very long time," he said.
The state's population growth was on the up again, because "more people are moving to Tasmania from the mainland than the other way round for the first time in six years".
Mr Eslake said Tasmania's state public sector was "in good financial shape" with "spending growing at a consistently slower rate than revenue".
"Importantly, non-financial public sector net debt is lower, relative to the size of Tasmania's economy, than it is in any other state or territory except New South Wales."
Mr Eslake noted the mining sector fell by 9.1 per cent in 2016-17, the "third consecutive large decline".
The financial and insurance services sector contracted by 11.2 per cent, while construction shrunk by 5.2 per cent.
"The declines in activity in these three sectors sliced almost 1.5 percentage points off Tasmania's overall economic growth rate in 2016-17," he said.
Mr Eslake said the report listed a "range of recommendations" for the next State Government to consider after the 2018 election.
The recommendations include:
But the chief executive of the Tasmanian Council of Social Service, Kym Goodes, said education and health, low household incomes, housing affordability and the "essentials of life" such as energy, healthy food and transport "continue to be major issues".

"Every year 5,000 households go without meals, 7,000 can't afford to heat their homes and over 21,000 struggle to pay their bills on time," she said.
"We don't want this to be the story of our future. The people of Tasmania know that things can change."
Ms Goodes said future direction should take into account the human cost of maintaining a healthy "bottom line".
"We tend to default to discussion about our deficits and, in doing so, quickly lose sight of our greatest potential asset - our people. People are not born a liability," she said.
"To change, we need to invest differently - in communities and people, in the same way we invest in projects of state significance, in industries, in tourism infrastructure.
Mr Eslake's major education recommendation was to shutter Tasmania's college system, which has historically provided Year 11 and Year 12.
He said the system was expensive, and needed radical change to achieve better educational outcomes.
The State Government, the Labor Opposition and the Greens have all rejected the suggestion.
Education Minister Jeremy Rockliff said the college system was a very important part of the educational system.
"We have very good, strong partnerships and models developing right now as part of our [years] 11 and 12 policy between our high schools and our colleges," he said.
"We've had the biggest single jump ever in terms of TCE attainment in the last 12 months. We have record amounts of our students when it comes to retention."
The State Government has promised to extend every public high school through to Year 12 if it's re-elected.
All three parties also rejected any sale of public assets.
"As we have stated before, we will not sell public assets," Premier Will Hodgman said.
"Unlike Labor, we have shown that a majority Liberal Government can balance the budget as well as invest more into key frontline services."
Greens leader Cassy O'Connor said sales would lead to higher costs.
"Inevitably it [a sell-off] leads to higher costs for consumers, and once public property is sold off you just don't get it back," she said.
Shadow deputy leader Michelle O'Byrne said Labor would not be selling any assets.
"Labor has no plans to privatise any of the assets that are currently in government hands," she said.

Australia and Canada have a lot in common when it comes to property — both nations have record housing debt and have had surging prices in two of their key cities.
But there are some key differences in housing policy and financial practices that may make Australia more vulnerable to a housing crash.
These differences have been highlighted by the chief executive of Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), Evan Siddall, who was the keynote speaker at a recent conference hosted by the Australian Housing and Urban Research Institute (AHURI).
In an exclusive interview with the ABC, Mr Siddall touched on four reasons why Australia might be more vulnerable to a severe housing downturn than Canada, as well as one key area where both countries are taking a similar approach — foreign investors.
Canadian households have a lot of debt, in fact their debt is slightly bigger than the annual output of the nation's entire economy, 101 per cent of GDP.
That debt level is twice as big as it was at the start of the 1990s.

Mr Siddall said it is a key concern for Canada's policymakers.
"We're not proud of the level of indebtedness in Canada and we're quite concerned about it — it's even higher in Australia," he observed.
Australia's household debt is 122 per cent of our annual economic output — that level has surged much more than two-and-a-half times what it was at the start of the 1990s.

Why is this a problem?
"Because debt is basically spending future income — what you're doing is you're mortgaging your future economic growth," Mr Siddall explained.
"The correlation between high house prices and high indebtedness and a future economic recession is extremely high."
Evan at record low interest rates, Australian and Canadian households are struggling with the burden of large interest bills.
In Australia, this is already showing up in weak consumer spending which is dragging on economic growth.
That is a trend that will only get worse as rates eventually rise back towards more usual levels.
Rising interest rates is another area where Canada may have an advantage over Australia.

Not only are Canadian households less indebted, but they also tend to have fixed-rate mortgages.
"Seventy-five per cent of our mortgages are five years or longer and so, even in the event of a rate shock, we only have about 25 or 30 per cent of mortgages that come due every year and are required to be refinanced and therefore exposed to that interest rate risk," Mr Siddall explained.
When told that somewhere around 80 per cent of Australian mortgages were on variable interest rates, Mr Siddall was taken aback.
"That is a vulnerability," he responded.
"That makes Australian mortgage holders more subject to rate shock than they would be here in Canada."
Canadians are currently being tested, with the nation's central bank having lifted rates twice in the second half of this year.
Although Canadian interest rates remain lower than Australia's official cash rate, at 1 per cent versus 1.5 per cent.
Australia's tendency towards variable mortgages was seen as a strength during the global financial crisis, as it meant most households got an immediate benefit from the Reserve Bank's dramatic interest rate cuts, but it means Australians are immediately vulnerable as global interest rise back to more typical levels.
As highlighted during the global financial crisis, many large banks are considered "too big to fail" and will be bailed out if a housing market crash leads to large losses.
Australia's big four banks benefit from this implicit guarantee by receiving lower interest rates when they raise money on international markets — their credit ratings are effectively linked to the Australian Government's.
Mr Siddall said that creates what economists call "moral hazard".
"There's an incentive for people to lend rather less prudently because they believe they can count on a government bailout," he explained.
Canada also has banks that are too big to fail and would probably be bailed out if they got into trouble.
However, it also requires banks to take out mortgage insurance on all low-deposit home loans (less than 20 per cent deposit).
CMHC provides that insurance, along with two private competitors.

"At the end of the day, when it comes to home owners in a house price crash the government is going to end up paying for that, because home owners are taxpayers, as opposed to banks which we should let fail," Mr Siddall argued.
"It will be unbelievably tempting for politicians, and I think probably responsible for politicians, to help support home owners in the event of a generalised housing crash.
"We collect premia for that at CMHC and we contribute about $2 billion a year to reducing the Federal Government's deficit."
In Australia, both lenders' mortgage insurers are privately owned — the Government gets no premiums, but would probably still be on the hook to bail out the big banks if the housing market crashed and one or both of those insurers collapsed.
CMHC also has monopoly control over selling Canadian residential mortgage backed securities, which are a key source of funding for home loans.
In Australia these securities are sold by banks and non-bank mortgage lenders, which limits regulatory control of the amount of mortgage funding available.
Another potential advantage Canada has over Australia is the CMHC itself.
Not only does it do mortgage insurance, but also runs Canada's national housing affordability programs and provides policy advice.
"Being able to look at the whole spectrum, from homelessness to home ownership, means that we can have a comprehensive, integrated strategy," Mr Siddall ventured.
AHURI's executive director, Dr Ian Winter, agrees that Australia lacks national coordination in housing policy, especially when it comes to new housing.

"Whilst we're getting a fair bit of new supply — over 200,000 completions over the past couple of years, which are historical highs — most of the new stock is overwhelmingly at the high price end," he said.
"So we're not seeing either new supply at lower price segments or indeed any evidence that there's a trickle down of that new supply or of people vacating existing supply so that we're getting some sort of flow through of dwellings to first home buyers, for instance."
However, Dr Winter said the National Housing Finance Investment Corporation, a Federal Government-backed bond aggregator, will improve access to finance for affordable rental housing projects.
While Australia and Canada are tackling their housing affordability problems in different ways, they have tried some common approaches.
One has been for banking regulators to improve lending standards by getting banks to use tests when assessing how much prospective home buyers can afford to borrow.
"Prudential underwriting is the first line of defence and I think both countries have got better and better at that," Mr Siddall said.
The booming areas of both countries have also put special taxes on foreign buyers of residential property — in Vancouver and Toronto in Canada and through increased stamp duties in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland in Australia.

Mr Siddall said the taxes in Canada appear to have just brought forward some buyers' investments, but now foreign demand in Vancouver is back where it was before the tax.
"These are politically expedient measure but ultimately not that effective," he said.
"We know in Canada that there is more speculation activity and investment activity being done by domestic Canadians than non-Canadians and so these policies aren't the solution."

The near-fatal poisoning of a NSW Central Coast man with severe autism who drank a cocktail of highly toxic herbicides left in an unmarked drink bottle has sparked fresh calls for a nationwide ban on Paraquat.
Damien Terry's survival, after accidentally drinking a combination of the commercial weed killers Paraquat and Diquat, has been described as nothing less than "miraculous".
The 21-year-old and his carer were visiting a sports oval on Mangrove Mountain in August, when he suddenly started vomiting uncontrollably shortly after returning from the disabled toilet.
He had been poisoned after accidentally sipping the chemicals, which he found in an abandoned soft drink bottle.
Safety warnings displayed on all Paraquat products include that it must be labelled clearly and not placed in drinking containers.
Doctors at Gosford Hospital told his family to prepare for the worst.
"The doctors basically said to us that Damien probably had 12 hours to live," said Mr Terry's mother, Julie Terry.
"Their words were 'nobody' survives from ingesting Paraquat.
"Obviously you go into a state of shock. Damien looked quite well, although he was vomiting quite significantly, he looked well so it was hard to comprehend that he was as ill as he was.

"At that point ... they just said he would have massive organ failure and I just asked them to keep him as comfortable as possible."
After two agonising weeks in hospital not knowing whether Mr Terry would pull through, he is now on the road to recovery and his family wants to speak out about the dangers of Paraquat.
It is a highly effective weed killer commonly used by farmers across Australia but is also extremely toxic: it only takes a few sips to kill a person and has no antidote.
In 2015, a Queensland farmer died after the deadly herbicide accidentally sprayed into his mouth when he was filling a pressure back-pack pump spray.
Paraquat has caused thousands of deaths worldwide and is banned in more than 30 countries including China, Cambodia and across the European Union.
There is also a debate about its links to Parkinson's disease.
The poison has been under review by regulator, the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority, since 1997 due to health and environmental concerns, with a final determination due next year.

The Terrys want a major crackdown on its use and availability but are ultimately seeking a nationwide ban.
"It defies logic in my mind that this is available over the counter for anybody to purchase," Ms Terry said.
"Everybody knows these days that health and safety is a very common agenda for all of us in the workplace so I feel a bit disillusioned that the authorities didn't keep an eye on that."
The Terrys call is one that is strongly supported by the National Toxics Network.
"It beggars belief a pesticide of this toxicity would ever be used in a public facility, let alone decanted into a drinking bottle," said environmental campaigner Jo Immig.
"What it really illustrates is the failure of risk management when it comes to highly dangerous pesticides.
"It's been banned by 32 other countries and it's high time the regulator put the needs of people and the planet first ... it's just a very highly toxic chemical that has no place in common use in Australia today."
Newcastle University environmental contamination expert Professor Ravi Naidu has also questioned why the herbicide was anywhere near the sports ground.
"When Paraquat is applied, that time and at least for 20 days children should not be exposed at all. If they're exposed then it poses risk," Professor Naidu said.
He said a national ban on Paraquat would hurt the agriculture industry but agrees it should be more tightly regulated.

"I think the best way forward would be restrictive availability and therefore farmers must demonstrate they have a farm and a need for that and only the amount they need should be available."
A New South Wales Environment Protection Authority (EPA) investigation is underway into the poisoning, which could take up to three years.
An EPA spokeswoman said any pesticide misuse resulting in harm to human health is extremely serious.
She said the authority was looking at a range of offences under the pesticides legislation, with a maximum penalty of $60,000 for an individual and up to $120,000 for a corporation for each offence.
Central Coast Council has declined to comment while the incident is being investigated.
Four months on, the Terrys' lives are returning to normal but they are determined make sure other families are spared the same trauma.
"[Damien's] recovery has been miraculous — there's no other word for it. He should be gone," Ms Terry said.
"We just feel absolutely blessed he's still with us."

The Federal Government has committed to building a $10 billion inland rail line that will transport freight between Melbourne and Brisbane.
Advocates say it's vital to ease the number of trucks on our roads and to link Australia's farmers and manufacturers more efficiently with their markets.
While generally welcomed, the massive project has also raised plenty of questions from those whose lives will be most affected, as the ABC discovered when it travelled along the proposed route.
To answer some of the key questions we've gone to the top — John Fullerton, the chief executive of the Australian Rail Track Corporation (ARTC), which has the job of turning the century-old dream into a reality.
Because of the sheer volume of goods it will be able to move, according to Mr Fullerton.
"One 1,800-metre train, double-stacked, operating between Melbourne and Brisbane is equivalent to over 100 B-double [trucks]," he said.

"So to me that should tell people what the benefits of rail is, compared to road, when you can take those trucks off the road, reduce congestion, improve safety."
The volume of freight travelling along the eastern seaboard is expected to double to 8 billion tonnes by 2030, he said.

Currently three-quarters of all freight is transported by road and one-quarter by rail. The ARTC's ambitious aim is to reverse that mix.
"The real problem we have on the coastal route today is that it takes 32 hours to move freight from Melbourne to Brisbane via Sydney," he said.
"It has to navigate the curfews in the Sydney metro area, so you can understand why we only have 25 per cent of that [freight] volume on rail, because it only attracts the slow-moving, non-time sensitive freight."
One of inland rail's key targets is to offer an express service that delivers freight directly between Melbourne and Brisbane in less than 24 hours.
Yes, if rail is cheaper and more efficient than road.
"If the costs are the same as road, most times customers will choose [road] because it is more flexible," Mr Fullerton said.
"But if you can make rail 20 to 30 per cent cheaper than road, as well as providing the same level of service in terms of transit time, freight availability, it is a very easy decision for our customers to make."
But there are no promises.
ARTC is building the railway and will charge rail and freight companies to use it. Freight companies will factor that cost into the rates they charge farmers and businesses to carry their goods.

Graham Moore, from Pacific National — the largest rail freight company in Australia — said he was hopeful rates would drop.
"I think we can create the opportunity for [lower rates] to occur. Is there a guarantee? I don't think you can put a guarantee in place," the national manager of planning operations said.
Mr Fullerton is confident inland rail will lower freight costs for consumers.
"The best example is to look at our east-west business between Sydney and Perth and Melbourne and Perth," Mr Fullerton said. "It's two-thirds cheaper than road, running on those long distances."

When federal Treasurer Scott Morrison committed the bulk of the estimated $10 billion cost of the inland railway in this year's budget, he said the project would "support every regional location along the route".
But that support may be a lot, or very little, depending on where you live.
Inland rail advocate and former Nationals deputy leader Tim Fischer told the ABC the rail line wouldn't revive all of the dying towns along its route.
It'll be the regional centres which become freight hubs that will benefit most.
In New South Wales, Parkes — which sits at the centre of the Perth-to-Sydney and planned Melbourne-to-Brisbane rail lines — already has two major freight terminals, and Pacific National is pouring millions of dollars into expanding its base there.

ARTC estimates inland rail will create 16,000 jobs during the construction phase. The company will employ another 500 staff and there will be 5,000 contractors, Mr Fullerton added.
"If you think about the local benefits from the construction you've got local delis, local motels, local earthmoving companies, you've got local employment and you can see the multiplier effect quickly adding up to that estimate of 16,000," he said.
There will also be ongoing employment in roles such as train drivers and maintenance workers, he said.
Inland rail has been sold as providing the backbone for a freight system to last 100 years.
But given the pace of technological change, is rail in danger of being rendered a dinosaur?
Driverless vehicles, for example, are potentially only years away from taking to the roads, and who knows what artificial intelligence will bring to mobility and all forms of transport and infrastructure in the future?
Mr Fullerton believes rail will hold its own.
"A number of years ago rail was considered to be old-world technology. But it has been remarkable how it's made a recovery around the world," he said.
"Rail is now seen as the perfect way to move freight and people around the country and get congestion off the roads, make roads safer and it is good for the environment.
"So that's why governments around the world are now investing heavily in rail networks because of the benefits they offer."
Mr Moore from Pacific National goes further.

"What you get for your dollar on inland rail is a huge bang for your buck," he said. "The amount being spent … this would deliver only a very small section of highway in metro Sydney."
And he says rail is also constantly developing.
"We'd like to explore technology that allows us to do transitions of freight while we are moving," he said, as a lot of fuel is wasted in stopping and starting trains.
If all goes according to ARTC's business plan, inland rail will boost Australia's GDP by $16 billion over the next 50 years — but it's not expected to turn its first profit until just before then.

One third of the 1,700-kilometre inland railway will be completely new railway corridors, carved through state and privately owned land.
Balancing ARTC's need for a straight, flat track allowing speed and efficiency, and the myriad concerns of landowners, businesses and communities is a continuing challenge.
The Narrabri and Barradine Local Aboriginal Land Councils (LALCs) that oversee the Pilliga Forest in New South Wales said they were contacted by ARTC in May about the possibility of the railway going through the forest, which contains Aboriginal heritage sites, or surrounding farmland.
Infrastructure Minister Darren Chester last month announced the route would go through the forest, but the LALCs were unaware of this until informed by the ABC.
Mr Fullerton said there had been "significant" consultation, but acknowledged "we could always do better".

"Determining the alignment is just the first step in the process," he said. "We'll be working closely with all of those parties that are potentially impacted by the railway.
"And they'll also have a lot of opportunity to submit their concerns through that environmental approval process."

Millmerran farmer Russell Stevens, whose property lies within the preferred new rail corridor through south-east Queensland, has said he would have to be dragged off his land.
"Our commitment is to work with every individual landowner, understand what their issues are so that we can get to a satisfactory resolution," Mr Fullerton said.
"I am not going to second guess those things. I think we can avoid them from happening."
He has met with Mr Stevens and floodplain farmers in the wake of the announced route.
"We really want to bring the whole population with us to make inland rail an experience that is good for the regions and people can see the value in it for the Australian economy," he added.
Construction on a new section of the railway — Parkes to Narromine in NSW— will begin by the middle of next year and the first freight train is due to roll along the entire line in 2024-25, according to Mr Fullerton.
"It's a 10-year schedule we put together in 2015," he said.
"There's certainly been some delays around determination of alignment and so on. But we are going to work very hard to get all of those things into place to enable us to run that first train in 2025."
As for finishing the project within the estimated $10 billion cost: "ARTC has got the responsibility given to us by the Federal Government … and that is what we are going to get on and do."

The Bougainville Government is holding a crucial mining warden's hearing at the abandoned copper mine which sparked a decade-long armed insurgency against the Papua New Guinea Government.

The hearing will help determine if the company Bougainville Copper Limited (BCL), which was forced to abandon the Panguna mine in 1989, should retain an exploration licence for the site.
The Bougainville Government now owns part of Bougainville Copper Limited and wants it to redevelop the mine, but a rival consortium is challenging their bid, and said it has the support of key landowners from Panguna.
That consortium, Central Me'ekamui Exploration Limited, includes ASX-listed RTG Mining.
RTG's chairman Michael Carrick said the group's proposal was more realistic and better-supported by the people of Panguna.
"[It's] a sensible and well-supported and economically deliverable proposal to develop the mine for the benefit of all the people of Bougainville," he said.
RTG Mining has told the Bougainville Government that BCL's exploration licence for Panguna has expired and legally cannot be renewed.
It wants the Bougainville Government to consider its application instead, saying the landowner association for the mine pit, the Special Mining Lease Osikaiyang Landowners Association (SMLOLA), backs its bid and would present a 2,000-signature petition in opposition to BCL.
"For the first time in 30 years a mining company has been endorsed and supported by the SMLOLA," Mr Carrick said.
RTG Mining said longstanding resentment against BCL over the conflict and the ongoing environmental problems caused by their sudden withdrawal would prevent the company from being able to operate the mine again.
"The legacy issues for BCL are insurmountable," Mr Carrick said.
He said the landowners would present a 2000-signature petition in opposition to BCL.
There is a legal dispute over who rightfully chairs the landowner association.
RTG Mining said the dispute had been settled with their preferred candidate, Philip Miriori, in charge; the Bougainville Government said the mediation had failed and that the matter is still before the courts.

The Bougainville Government has also criticised the consortium for paying landowners who support them and implied it is not respecting the approval process.
"The Autonomous Bougainville Government (ABG) will not entertain companies who use the back door or break and enter through the window using self-centred individuals who think they have a monopoly over the people's resources or represent their interests," Mining Minister Raymond Masono said in a statement.
"… The ABG rejects companies that think they can bribe their way into people's resources by giving certain individuals money to gain landowner consent."
The ABG has had the PNG Government ban the key executive from Central Exploration, Sydney lawyer Renzie Duncan, from coming to Papua New Guinea.
Michael Carrick from RTG Mining says the consortium has been dealing openly with the Bougainville Government and that landowner payments are wages for its employees.
"The wages paid are in respect of services rendered to the joint venture," he said.
"The joint venture is a commercial operation and landowners, like anyone else, are able to work and to get paid for their services.
"Our dealings with landowners have been completely transparent and professional."
Mr Carrick said the intent of the travel ban against Mr Duncan appeared to be to help Bougainville Copper Limited.
"It is clear the ABG, on the appointment of the new mining minister, supported BCL and the temporary banning of Renzie, I assume, is designed to limit the support that could be afforded to the landowners of Panguna," he said.
Bougainville Copper Limited is deeply unhappy with RTG Mining and its partners.
"We think they're less than honourable in how they're carrying on their conduct and their activities in the area," BCL company secretary Mark Hitchcock said.
He said BCL's licence application was legal, and wasn't processed on time because the Bougainville Government wasn't ready to implement the processes of its new Mining Act.
"The department didn't have the resources to manage the application at the time it was taking place," he said.
"It now has all those facilities in place."
Mr Hitchcock said many landowners do support BCL, but are not being properly represented.
"From what we've seen, there is widespread support for mining in Panguna and mining with Bougainville Copper," he said.
Bougainville's Mining Secretary Shadrach Himata said all landowners will be asked for their views as part of the approval process, not just the leaders of the association.
"The warden's hearing is a process that will engage the views of all the landowners in the resource areas," he said.
"It won't be affected by the leadership tussle of the SMLOLA landowners."
Crucially, Mr Himata, said BCL is the only company currently being considered by the Bougainville Government.
"Right now, the only legal applicant on the exploration tenement is BCL," he said.
"Until that process is completed, there are no other applicants or applications over the same tenement. That's the position of Government."
The eventual decision on the exploration licence will be made by the Bougainville Executive Council, the regional government's Cabinet, probably sometime in 2018.

Angry retailers have ambushed the NSW Premier and the state's Transport Minister at the reopening of a section of Sydney's CBD where new light rail lines have been built.
The State Government is calling it Sydney's hottest selfie spot. It's a section of George Street between Park and King Streets now open, with part of it adorned with Christmas tree arches and flashing lights.
But some retailers are not feeling the cheer after enduring years of construction.
Long-time Strand Arcade jewellers Mark and Jennifer Duff made their feelings known to Transport Minister Andrew Constance at a press conference on Sunday.
"We are talking about collateral damage that you don't care about, because that's what we are," Ms Duff said.
"Well collateral damage ... but what I'm saying is we have provided rental assistance," Mr Constance replied.
The Duffs said the rental assistance is not enough to compensate for two years of lost trade, but Mr Constance was not exactly interested in hearing their comments.
"I'm here to answer questions from journalists," the Minister said.
"Run your own press conference mate.
"Guess what? Your business is about to pick up massively because guess what, here it is, here come the people.
"You had availability to some rent assistance, I hope you applied.
"This is a Government that listens and we have provided no compensation but what we have provided is some rent relief to businesses."
The State Government has confirmed 51 retailers have applied for rent help with 34 approved and 30 currently paid.
At least one business has received $100,000.
Mr Constance said the Government was "not in the business" of compensating businesses who will ultimately benefit from the infrastructure.
Mr Constance said 13.5 kilometres of the project's 25 kilometres had been completed, and work on the Queen Victoria Building station would commence in the new year.
"Thanks Sydney thus far, but we've got a long way to go," he said.

After nearly two years of traffic disruptions and delays, and months more of debate and dispute, Adelaide's new O-Bahn tunnel is expected to open to public metro buses on Monday.
The $160 million project was officially unveiled today, with locals given the chance to walk the length of the 670-metre tunnel from Hackney Road to Grenfell Street.
The tunnel is intended to ease congestion and reduce daily travel times for passengers heading to and from the north-eastern suburbs, and has been delivered "on time and on budget", according to the SA Government.
Wheelchair users have raised concerns about evacuation procedures in the tunnel for people with disabilities — criticisms which were rejected by Transport Minister Stephen Mullighan.
But Mr Mullighan stopped short of guaranteeing the first services through the tunnel would be on Monday morning, adding that final safety testing had to be carried out first.
"We've just got to make sure that after having so many thousands of people coming through the tunnel today, we do a full inspection, a check and one more test of all of the safety and security systems within the tunnel," he said.
"That'll give us the confidence we can start running services."

Only a handful of routes will be passing through the tunnel when services start tomorrow, but every O-Bahn bus should be using the tunnel by next weekend, the Government said.
Once fully operational, more than 30,000 passengers are expected to use the tunnel each week day.
Mr Mullighan said the first few hours of its operation would help transport authorities get to grips with any teething problems.
"All of the systems that have been installed ... will be under intense scrutiny during those first services," he said.
"We've got to make sure that we've got the calibration of the traffic lights and the traffic systems correct."

Dignity Party MP Kelly Vincent, who was among those inspecting the tunnel this morning, was concerned passengers with disabilities were not properly considered during the planning.
"We've been contacted by bus drivers who say they're not clear on what the evacuation procedures are," she said.
"If there is a fire or another emergency and they have someone who is a wheelchair user or uses a gopher or other mobility aid, they are concerned about potentially not being able to deploy the ramps because the footpath is ... very narrow."
But Mr Mullighan said he had been advised safety testing took wheelchair users into consideration.
"They did test getting people off those buses who do have mobility issues, who were in wheelchairs," he said.

Opposition transport spokesman David Pisoni said the O-Bahn project should have been accompanied by improvements to Grenfell and Currie streets.
He said the number of buses along the thoroughfare meant the road needed better maintenance.
"What's underneath the bitumen is what needs to be repaired. It's not good enough simply to patch the bitumen every time we see a pothole or a dip in the road caused by the buses," Mr Pisoni said.
The Government said the tunnel project had supported 450 jobs, generated $94 million worth of contracts and used about 2,000 tonnes of Whyalla steel.

One in three Melbourne suburbs now have a median house price of at least $1 million, and the once-affordable outer suburbs are also on the rise, according to Victoria's leading real estate body.
The latest data from the Real Estate Institute of Victoria found 90 per cent of suburbs within 10 kilometres of the CBD and almost half of suburbs in the middle ring — between 10 and 20km — are now in the million-dollar club.

Ten years ago only three middle-ring suburbs had a seven-figure median price.
REIV president Richmond Simpson said 154 of Melbourne's 402 suburbs recorded a median house price of $1 million or higher.
A staggering 44 suburbs made the jump in 2017, including Mordialloc on Melbourne's bayside, Kingsville in the inner west, and Coburg in the north.
"Ninety per cent of suburbs in the inner ring have a median house price of over a $1 million, that's what you sort of expect," he said.
"Suburbs such as Moorabbin, Craigieburn, Narre Warren North, those types of suburbs, they're the ones we're seeing the best price growth."
Clayton, 19 kilometres south-east of the city, had been a standout according to Mr Simpson. Its median house price increased 210 per cent over the last decade — now at $1.3 million.

"We've had unprecedented growth in real estate prices over the last 10 years, but more particularly in the last few years," he said.
"It's mainly driven by low interest rates and also high population movements to Melbourne from interstate and overseas that's put pressure on housing."
With Melbourne's population still growing at a strong rate, the REIV said it's likely more suburbs will join the million-dollar club.
"And we'll see the price in the outer suburbs coming up towards that $1 million. Suburbs in that middle ring, people can't afford those anymore, so what we're seeing is a lot more competition in the outer ring."

Despite calls from the Prime Minister to keep the coal-powered Liddell Power Station open, AGL has announced it will close the plant and repurpose it with a commitment to clean energy.
Investments will be made in gas, renewables and battery storage as part of  the NSW Generation Plan, with AGL confirming it will close the Hunter Valley station in 2022 as planned.
AGL said along with the NSW Government, it is also exploring the feasibility of a pumped hydro project in the Hunter region.
The Federal Government wanted to delay the closure of the plant for at least another five years, but AGL said a replacement electricity generation plan was far more affordable.
AGL chairman Graeme Hunt said the investments reflected the changing needs of the market and improvements in technology.
"This plan demonstrates that old power plants can be replaced with a mixture of new, cleaner technology, while improving reliability and affordability," he said.
An efficiency upgrade will also take place at Bayswater Power Station as part of the plan, which will create more capacity, without using additional fuel.

Malcolm Turnbull said the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) was looking at the plan to ensure there was not an energy shortfall.
"AGL has got a plan which they have produced for the first time which they say will meet that gap. It is being examined by AEMO now and we will look forward to discussions with AEMO," he said.
"So I want to be very clear about this, I am technology agnostic about energy."
However, Mr Turnbull fought a hard fight to urge AGL to find a buyer for Liddell to ensure a stable supply of electricity.
"You can't run an electricity system just on solar panels and wind farms. You can't."
Australian Conservation Foundation chief executive Kelly O'Shanassy said the decision was great news.
"We need to listen to AGL here, we need to switch off coal and move to renewables as fast as we can," she said.
Ms O'Shanassy said the Turnbull Government must now drop its obsession with coal and end its delaying tactics on climate change action.

"Keeping Liddell polluting for another five years was nothing more than a poorly informed thought bubble from the Prime Minister.
"What we need is a strong, comprehensive plan that would speed-up the retirement of polluting coal plants and accelerate the transition to clean energy."
In September former AGL chairman Jerry Maycock warned the 45-year-old Liddell station was nearing the end of its lifespan and was not at peak reliability.
"While it may be technically possible to extend the life of the power station, the costs of doing so in a way to ensure the plant is even moderately reliable are certain to be substantial," he said.
AGL announced in 2015 that as part of its greenhouse gas policy, its coal-fired power stations including Liddell would close by 2022.
A commitment has been made by AGL to its employees that it will not use forced redundancies when Liddell retires.

Adani's contentious mine site access deal with traditional owners has won the green light from native title authorities, months before a federal court ruling on whether the agreement is valid.
The National Native Title Tribunal on Friday registered Adani's Indigenous Land Use Agreement (ILUA) with the Wangan and Jagalingou (W&J), which is critical to gaining finance for the huge Carmichael coalmine.
The ILUA represents the Indigenous consent without which major banks will not back resources projects.

It also paves the way for the state to permanently extinguish native title rights over 2,750 hectares of the W&J's ancestral homelands in the Galilee Basin.
But it comes amid growing doubts about Adani's ability to clinch investors for the $22 billion project, after China's biggest banks joined a list of 27 financiers who have ruled out any involvement.
Traditional owners opposing Adani implored the re-elected Palaszczuk Government to drop its backing of the ILUA.

Adrian Burragubba, a member of the W&J native title applicant group, which is split down the middle on the Adani mine, also called on the government to "give assurances" it would not move to wipe out native title at Adani's request.
"We ask the government to take their hands off the ILUA, to not be a party to it," he told the ABC.
"Also, to give us an assurance that they won't go for compulsory acquisition.
"It's very doubtful a Labor government would put themselves in that position.
"We are trying to save our native title rights. We don't want that area to be extinguished for any reason."
The mine opponents have already filed a federal court bid for an injunction against Adani and the government if they move to extinguish native title.

Mr Burragubba also questioned the role of Adani supporters within the group who are pushing for the deal with the miner.
Irene Simpson, who was instrumental in reviving the deal with Adani last year, is now employed as an Indigenous engagement officer by the mining giant.
Mr Burragubba said this was "certainly" a conflict of interest.
He said Ms Simpson had "reached out to Adani personally" to re-establish negotiations "to put the ILUA back on the table" after the W&J claim group rejected the miner in 2012 and 2014.
Ms Simpson did not respond to the ABC this week.
An Adani jobs roadshow with contractor Downer, which Ms Simpson was to attend next week in Townsville and Palm Island, was cancelled without explanation on Thursday.
Adani and its W&J supporters say the mine was authorised by 294 votes to one in a meeting in April last year in Maryborough.
But opponents alleged votes against the deal were ignored and the meeting was stacked by people who were paid thousands of dollars by Adani to recruit attendees.
Another authorisation meeting held last week rejected the ILUA.
The W&J Adani opponents have enlisted high-profile barrister Stephen Keim for their legal challenge.
The tribunal decision to register the ILUA represented a backflip after months of pressure from Adani.
The tribunal was originally going to wait for the outcome of the federal court trial in March.
But Adani's lawyers argued it was the same situation when the Queensland mining minister and the environment department were able to approve its licenses, despite pending legal challenges.

Thousands of West Australians are expected to see the value of their apartments plummet and insurance premiums go through the roof on Wednesday, when up to 150 strata properties are named on a list of buildings with potentially combustible cladding.
The peak body for strata management is set to notify the managers of the properties that they require further investigation by the WA Building Commission.
The WA President of Strata Community Australia (SCA) Scott Bellerby said while most of the buildings were likely to be safe, he was worried residents could see massive costs from insurers while they wait for certification.
"The insurers would potentially withhold the policies and certainly they would be looking to put up the policies until they know, to their satisfaction, there isn't a risk there that the building might go up in flames" he said.
"When this goes public the insurers will insist that these buildings be assessed, there is no two ways about it, the buildings will have to be assessed by a fire engineer.
"If the building is deemed to be at risk and requires remediation the insurer will insist that remediation occur immediately, otherwise they will not extend the policy."
The WA Building Commission began a state-wide audit into cladding in July, in the wake of the deaths of 71 people in an apartment fire in London fuelled by dangerous cladding.
The cladding was checked on more than 1,900 buildings of three stories or more and built after 2000.
The Commission wants to further investigate 215 of them for potential risk.
While the list of buildings has not been made public, it has been given to the SCA, to help in notifying property managers.
The SCA has so far identified 50 properties that it represents, and expects this to grow to up to 150, which could affect about 9,000 people.
Mr Bellerby said while the association did not want to create angst in the community, it did want to be transparent with its members, and will notify them on Wednesday which properties are affected.
"Once that happens then of course you will see the insurers come knocking," he said.
"There'll be a degree of nervousness out there, until we've been able to get a risk assessment undertaken on the building, people will have a little bit of concern that maybe their building is affected by flammable cladding."
Securing a risk assessment is not likely to be a fast process, with the SCA only able to identify ten fire inspectors in WA registered to standards it would accept, extending the time owners could spend paying higher premiums.
Mr Bellerby said those unable to meet those costs could be financially ruined, finding themselves stuck owning an apartment or property they could not afford to fix, but also could not sell with out a certificate of currency.

Residents of a strata apartment block in Melbourne have been locked in an expensive legal battle as they pursue the builder for costs of replacing cladding which caused a large fire in 2014.
If unsuccessful, apartment owners at the Lacrosse building could be facing costs of $40,000 to $70,000 each to replace the dangerous material.
Mr Bellerby said borrowing to pay the higher premiums or remediation costs was difficult, as the banks would raise interest rates due to associated risks.
Loans to strata schemes often see interest rates of about eight to nine per cent to begin with, due to banks facing difficulties recovering losses from individual strata members.
"In the end, even if the scheme does have the ability to borrow the money, the levies and costs of that will be so high that people will be reluctant to buy into a scheme where their additional overheads are so high" Mr Bellerby said.
The SCA is calling on the State Government to provide an interest-free loan scheme to help affected owners meet costs.
"Fundamentally, this is not a fair outcome for innocent owners who bought into a property, and State Government support is needed urgently," Mr Bellerby said.
While yet to see a formal proposal, Minister for Commerce Bill Johnston said those responsible should be the ones made to pay.
"The audit is on-going and it is too early to know what steps may be required for individual buildings," he said.
"Where building products are used in a non-compliant manner the responsible parties should be held to account."

Juggling university study and a young child, Allister Hill is a busy man.
But as the chairman of an owners corporation, the 42-year-old has had to deal with a lot more than usual since a fire broke out at his Brunswick apartment complex in March.
"There's just a lot of uncertainty at the moment," Mr Hill said.
"It has been pretty stressful and for me particularly because I've been trying to balance it all."
A faulty air conditioning unit sparked the blaze at the property in Melbourne's north, which quickly spread to the apartment above.
Fire investigators have since confirmed that combustible cladding unsuitable for tall apartment buildings had been installed.

As a result of the fire and the subsequent investigation, the apartment's insurance premiums have more than quadrupled.
"We're thankful for [the insurance] but it's a bit scary how much they want," Mr Hill said.
Neighbour Andy White expressed concern when he was told about the insurance hike.
"The cost of living's so high these days as it is," he said.
"To have your insurance go through the roof as well … what do you choose — the food on your table or your insurance?"
Legal action has been launched against the builder, Hickory Group, and the matter is now before the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal (VCAT).
The builder declined to comment.
The Victorian Government announced another cladding audit would take place over the next year after the Victorian Cladding Taskforce revealed 1,369 buildings "likely" had combustible cladding.
Each building will be given a danger rating from low to extreme.
The taskforce will also announce a "rectification tool" to help residents address the problem.
"We will go out and we will have physical inspections of buildings," Planning Minister Richard Wynne said.
"If rectification work needs to be undertaken, it will be undertaken."

But many residents remain sceptical their cladding will be fixed in a timely manner, and legal experts predict delays will lead to a surge in expensive, drawn-out legal action.
"There is always a reluctance from builders to hold out their hands to rectify defects," lawyer Andrew Whitelaw from TressCox Lawyers said.
"Some builders of course may take some responsibility up front while others are much more reluctant to step into the fray."

It took three years for builder LU Simon to agree to replace the cladding at the Lacrosse building in Melbourne's Docklands after fire tore up the side of the apartment complex.
The costs associated with replacing the cladding are still a matter of contention before VCAT.
Building companies have also agreed to replace cladding, at no cost to residents, at the Trilogi apartments in Prahran, Exo apartments in Docklands and Harvest apartments in Southbank.
However, Hickory Group would not confirm if they would replace the cladding at Elm apartments at Southbank.
The apartment buildings are among 10 identified by the Metropolitan Fire Brigade as requiring a heightened response due to their combustible cladding.
Mr Whitelaw represents eight owners corporations that are considering or commencing legal action, and he expects more to follow suit.
He said the Victorian legal system was "bogged down in applications" and reaching a resolution for each legal case could take years.

"The issue surrounding the cladding and how it's got to be on these buildings is a complicated one," he said.
It's also an expensive one.
Building inspection company Roscon told the ABC it cost, on average, between $3 million and $10 million to replace the cladding on most apartments blocks.
"This could lead to large builders going into liquidation in 2018," Roscon general manager Sahil Bhasin said.
"The reason for that is before they were used to $500,000 or $1 million defect claims.
"Having claims or counter claims of $3 million to $10 million against you, and then [multiplying] that by 10 buildings … may send some of these bigger builders into liquidation."
For now, residents at the Brunswick apartments want government intervention.
"There's been such a boom of apartments in the last 10 years and I think a level of under-regulation," Mr Hill said.
"[The Government] have a lot of responsibility because they've made decisions along the way that's led us to where we are."

Bitcoin and Kim Kardashian have one thing in common — they're famous for "being famous".
That's one reason why the digital currency's price has skyrocketed in the past week, reaching its record-high of $US17,154 ($22,842) at 1.00pm (AEDT), according to Coindesk.
"They've noticed its price has surged rapidly in a very short amount of time, so they naturally want to buy more bitcoin and speculate on its future gains.
"Bitcoin is also getting reported on extensively in the media, which in turn boosts its fame and popularity … the Kim Kardashian effect."
It was only a fortnight ago investors were cheering bitcoin's "fresh record" of almost $US10,000 ($13,316).
Essentially, Mr Williams said the market was a "bubble" — driven by speculative investors, rather than people who want to spend bitcoin like "real money".

Last year, a man walked into a bar (in Sydney) and made the regretful decision to pay for his pub meal with bitcoin.
His two burgers and two beers would only have cost $40 if he had paid in cash.
Instead, he chose to pay using one-fifth of a bitcoin.
"After six months, the price of bitcoin continued to rise and I joked with my mates that the burgers cost me $50, then $60," said Will, a finance executive who didn't want to be identified for this story.
"It kept escalating, and so did the joke!"
If only Will had held onto the partial-bitcoin, its value would have surged by 2,800 per cent.
One bitcoin was worth $798 back in June 2016, which is a very low price (with the benefit of hindsight).
"We now fondly refer to this as 'burger-gate' as my burgers would cost over $1,000 now," Will said.

Another problem with bitcoin payments is the surcharges — the precise amount is unknown for the customer until after the transaction is finalised.
Software engineer James Zaki found out the hard way when he purchased his first beer with bitcoin on Wednesday evening (also affectionately known as "Hump Day").

The bartender told him the beer would cost $7 (in cash), but James wanted to "have some fun" and experiment with the bitcoin technology.
Both men pulled out their smartphones — the bartender generated a QR code on his phone, which James then used his own phone to scan.
Within moments the bitcoin-for-beer transaction was finalised, and James learned the final price of his beer was a staggering $11.61.
It cost him an extra $4.61 — which is a 66 per cent surcharge.
Does he regret buying that beer?
"I have no regrets as I just wanted to try it in the real world for the first time," he said.
"I think I'll sit tight for a little while longer before trying this again."
Mr Williams explained the surcharge is a "mining fee", which is "dynamic" and "extremely variable".
Whereas James's surcharge was $4.61, sometimes it can be as low as just a few cents.
Basically, as bitcoin's popularity increased over the past few years, so did the time and delay in processing its digital transactions.

Bitcoin has a "block size" of 1 megabyte, which was adequate years ago when fewer people were using it.
Currently, bitcoin's capacity allows it to handle a few transactions per second (about seven), whereas conventional payment methods like Visa can process thousands per second.
"Instantaneous" bitcoin transactions normally attract a "mining fee", which is determined through a highly technical process (where a network of computers around the globe solve a complex mathematical problem to "verify" the customer's transaction).
This problem led to a Bitcoin 'civil war' and the creation of a spin-off currency in August, bitcoin cash — which was an attempt to solve the transaction speed and surcharge issue.
So what if one wants to buy their friends or favourite colleagues a beer?
"If you have to spend bitcoin, it's better to use it on more expensive, big-ticket items like laptops," Mr Williams said.
Since a top-of-the-range Macbook Pro costs $4,100, James's $4.61 surcharge would just be 0.1 per cent.
James has some advice for consumers: "Bitcoin is just not good for small purchases at the moment."
In just four hours, Bitcoin's price fell by 12 per cent to $US15,133 ($20,139) at 5.10pm (AEDT) — testament to its volatility.

Victorian supermarket shelves could be empty and fresh food could rot at sea if a union-backed blockade at the Port of Melbourne does not end soon, the Victorian Transport Association has warned.
About 50 workers from the Maritime Union of Australia have shut down the Victoria International Container Terminal (VICT) over the alleged treatment of one of its members.
The dispute has been ongoing for 10 days, forcing precious cargo to be diverted to Adelaide and then taken by road to Melbourne.
"There are goods coming directly into the shelves, there are goods being bought left right and centre," said the association's chief executive, Peter Anderson.
"Unfortunately the supply chain will be disrupted by this action."
The long-running dispute between the union and the VICT came to a head when an audit revealed that 22 workers did not have a Maritime Security Identification card, which lets workers into secure areas.
According to the union, the one worker who had taken the company to Fair Work had his employment terminated.

"This is the one person who had gone to the courts to raise the issue of bullying and intimidation and for that reason they sacked him and him only," said the union's Will Tracey.
"It's the company holding the community here to ransom in terms of treating one worker differently from the other 21 who identified without a permit."
The worker in question has a criminal record and has held a Maritime Security Identification card before.
But Mr Anderson said the workers' record makes him ineligible to work at the docks.
"The union want to then force the company to take this worker on," Mr Anderson said.
"It's now the company and all of Victoria through the supply chain process that's being held to ransom."

But Mr Tracey said other workers have just applied for discretionary permits after getting a police clearance.
"We probably have two or three people a week run into that sort of problems with their permits," Mr Tracey said.
The union wants the company to withdraw its letter of termination and give the man shifts when he gets his permit back.
"This company could fix this dispute right now, in the next 10 minutes," he said.

A $400 million 43-storey twin-tower development proposed for Perth's iconic Scarborough Beach has been knocked back by the body tasked with overseeing urban development of the city.
The hotel and entertainment precinct development was set to include a convention centre, hotel, apartments, shops and eateries on the corner of West Coast Highway and Scarborough Beach Road.
A statement from the Metropolitan Redevelopment Authority said the application, put forward by Chinese-owned developer 3 Oceans, had been refused planning approval because it was a significant overdevelopment of the site.

The plan included two towers — one of 43 storeys and another of 35 storeys — which is nearly four-times the base height maximum of 12 storeys under the MRA's Scarborough Planning Framework.
This framework allows developers to apply for an additional six storeys on buildings — taking the limit to 18 storeys in total — if the proposed development provides significant community benefits, such as:
The Rendezvous Hotel — the tallest building in Scarborough at 18 storeys — was granted such an exception when it was built under its original name: Observation City.
"The benefits proposed did not warrant the extent of discretion sought from the MRA," the statement said.
"Given the site's location on the corner of West Coast Highway and Scarborough Beach Road, the board determined that the critical mass of residents, workers and visitors on one site would also have serious impacts on the local traffic network."
Traffic concerns were highlighted in the lead up to the decision.
Despite an 11th-hour agreement with Main Roads WA and the developer for construction of a pedestrian bridge over West Coast Highway, the MRA said this was not included as part of the assessment.

3 Oceans managing director Dyno Zhang declined to answer questions from the media, but read a short statement decrying the decision, saying the firm was "surprised and disappointed".
"The MRA board has missed an opportunity to show courage and vision and support our project, which will be a game changer for the local Scarborough community," Mr Zhang said.
"The decision to refuse development approval for the iconic Scarborough project is contrary to State Government and City of Stirling's commitment to redevelop the Scarborough Beach foreshore."

He said it failed to align with government objectives of creating jobs and tourism opportunities.
"It sends the wrong signal for people wanting to invest in Western Australia, particularly in the local Scarborough area," Mr Zhang said.
"3 Oceans property group will now work with the State Government on finding a way for the project to proceed."
The project is associated with Chinese steel tycoon Ma Xibo, whose Hebei Qianjin steel group is the majority owner of 3 Oceans Property.
It also had backing from a Singapore-based investment group, Hong Rong.
Mr Ma has other interests in the State, swooping on the failed Palandri Wine Group in 2008 and re-branding the firm to 3 Oceans.
Planning Minister Rita Saffioti said the State Government was disappointed the issues with the development could not be resolved prior to the MRA Board's decision yesterday.
"We are keen to see significant development occur at the site and still hope to work with the applicant towards an agreeable proposal," she said.
This was the final meeting of the MRA Board, as the State Government moves to make major reforms to WA's land agencies, creating one central planning body out of the MRA and LandCorp.
Tourism Council chief executive Evan Hall said the rejection of this development would come at a great cost to tourism and jobs in WA.
"It means there is a lot of jobs forgone that we really do need in the economy at the moment and excellent facilities not only for West Australians but for our visitors around the world."
The MRA said it would welcome the opportunity to work with the developer on a modified proposal that was "more consistent with the vision of the Scarborough Master Plan".

Western Australian wildlife carers fear they may have to euthanise joeys because the cost of flying the native animals is twice as much as cats and dogs.
Broome-based wildlife carer Jan Martin struggles with the cost of flying marsupials.
She also sometimes needs to fly kangaroos 1,000km from Broome to Kununurra, a route only serviced by regional carrier, Air North.
The animals need to be transported to be raised by other wildlife carers or to be released back into the wild.
"I usually send them in pairs, so to send two little joeys, each five kilos, it's going to cost me $663. A dog would cost me $155," Ms Martin said.

Rose Best, from the Pilbara Wildlife Carers Association, rehabilitates about 120 kangaroos every year.
Due to a lack of local carers, some animals are sent from her home in Karratha to Perth, using Qantas or Virgin, which uses third party providers to manage its cargo unit.
"Our biggest problem is we can send them down, but the reds [kangaroos] come back up for release," Ms Best said.
"We're being charged $1,200 to send three red kangaroos back.
"It is totally cost prohibitive. We don't get much funding or support anymore, so when you're looking at nearly a third of your income going out in freight, we just have to say we can't do it.
"Unfortunately, there are eagles and birds of prey who need food.
"We might just have to put the joeys down and use them as meat."

Ms Martin believes Qantas should remove its famous animal branding known as the Flying Kangaroo.
"Take the big red kangaroo off the tail because they don't offer a service to wildlife," she said.
"Qantas is the Australian airline, you've got a kangaroo as your emblem, you use Australian wildlife with all your advertising and your touristy stuff and yet when one needs help…
"You want to charge me more than you charge that 10kg dog there."
Qantas defended the cost of transporting the kangaroos, saying the price discrepancy between pets and wildlife was due to the extra care needed to transport native animals.
"Kangaroos have never been classified as pets and animals, [because] kangaroos require more care than a domesticated animal such as a dog or cat, which is partly why there is a cost difference," a Qantas spokesperson said.

But the wildlife carers said kangaroos did not receive different treatment from pets on flights.
"They don't have different temperature requirements or anything like that," Ms Best said.
"The only consideration that we ask, that I think any cat or dog owner would ask, is that the crate isn't left sitting on the hot tarmac."
A Qantas spokesperson has told the ABC they are happy to work with wildlife carers on different options.
Editor's note (8/12/2017): The original version of this story stated that Air North is a subsidiary of Qantas, which was not correct. It has since been updated, along with a response from Qantas.

A Cape York man who struck a multi-million-dollar deal with a mining company behind the backs of other traditional owners siphoned off more than $250,000 for his own use, a court has found.
Ankamuthi man Larry Woosup, who kept cash payments and details of the deal secret from 75 other traditional owners, has been ordered to hand back $370,000.
The Federal Court also stripped Mr Woosup of the right to manage any money on behalf of the Ankamuthi people after he abused his role as a representative with oversight of up to $20 million in future royalty payments from bauxite mining.
The court ruling in Brisbane on Thursday drew a line under a bitter stoush that played out after 2013 when Mr Woosup negotiated a pact with Gulf Alumina Limited.
Justice Andrew Greenwood found Mr Woosup had "treated his people's money, benefits and compensation as his own and has entirely failed to account for the way in which it was used".
The judge upheld claims by other traditional owners that "Mr Woosup has taken the benefit of monies for himself in breach of his duties owed to the Ankamuthi people as [a] whole".
Justice Greenwood said the mining company had paid an advance of more than $371,000 but none of this was paid to or used for the benefit of the Ankamuthi people.
This included more than $255,000 Gulf Alumina had paid on July 25, 2014 that Mr Woosup "applied ... to his own use".
He ordered that Mr Woosup "account to the Ankamuthi people for $370,000" and repay that money via the court by February 6.
Justice Greenwood also barred Mr Woosup from "exercising any right to conduct transactions" around any bank account held by Seven Rivers Aboriginal Corporation, the trustee for the Ankamuthi people.
The successful challenge was brought by Mark Gebadi and six other people on behalf of a group of 75 traditional owners who were given no opportunity to review or authorise the deal with Gulf Alumina.
Mr Woosup in 2015 claimed the challengers were "johnny-come-lately" who had "no ties and no connection to country", a position rejected by the court.
Justice Greenwood said Mr Woosup and fellow Ankamuthi representative Beverly Tamwoy had failed to "disclose the terms of the agreement with Gulf" and so "breached duties of trust owed to the Ankamuthi People as a whole".

When tens of thousands of fans come streaming out of the new Perth Stadium on event days, there will be an army of local business owners waiting to welcome them with open arms.
Up to 14,000 people are expected to walk across the Matagarup pedestrian bridge — when it is finally opened in May — over the Swan River from the stadium and arrive on the East Perth foreshore.
Rose Deli owner Ursula Rose will be ready for them. She will be happy if even a fraction of them come in for a coffee or a bite to eat.
"It doesn't mean everyone is going to make a day of it in East Perth, but gosh, even if it's 5 per cent, that's a hell of a lot of people," Ms Rose said.
"We think it'll be terrific for the area."
Ms Rose was not the only one in East Perth expecting a big boost from the stadium.
The Royal on the Waterfront, on the Claisebrook inlet, is also planning to put on more staff and adapt its menu for hungry sports and music fans.

"We're going to expect a lot of people in East Perth ... it's going to benefit all the local businesses here quite significantly," manager Anoop Nair said.
The pub will be stocking extra beer and looking for other ways to capitalise on the expected crowds.
"There's lots of different options, maybe a pop-up bar outside, maybe a barbecue outside. There's plenty of opportunity there for us," Mr Nair said.
But not all those 14,000 people will be streaming through East Perth.
In fact, shuttle buses will be waiting for many, if not most, of those fans at the bottom of a ramp on the East Perth side of the bridge — which is expected to open in May — to whisk them straight to the CBD.
For anyone who wants to stay in the area, stairs from the bridge will lead towards Claisebrook Cove.
But the Public Transport Authority has added a gate at the top of those stairs "at the request of some local residents during early stakeholder engagement".

That request came from East Perth Community Safety Group. But it has some local businesses extremely worried that if the gate is closed, they will miss out on a lot of extra customers.
The group's chairman Jeff Broun said that was not the intention, rather it was to help direct people towards the shuttle buses so they would not get confused.
PTA spokesman David Hynes said "at this stage the gate will be open on game days, but it gives us the flexibility to close it should we require it for crowd management".
"We have been working hard to find the right balance between the needs of local residents, businesses and those of Optus Stadium patrons," Mr Hynes said.
"We firmly believe we have found the best solution for all parties.
"It is important to note the bridge will be open to the public at all times."
Local resident Bill MacGillivray is worried about drunken fans in the streets.
"I think it's going to be chock-a-block and bit horrendous here for people. I don't think it's really been thought out," he said.
The City of Perth is improving lighting and installing extra CCTV cameras in the area, and police will patrol on bicycles.

Across the river in Victoria Park, pubs, restaurants and cafes are also trying to make the most of the new stadium.
Nick Duncan, owner of the Broken Hill Hotel, said fans needed easy parking access.
"Hopefully, the council is listening to our pleas to make it free parking on game day, so that we can fill up all the streets and it's a nice 16, 17 minute walk to the ground from here, and they can have a couple of beers and be safe to drive home," Mr Duncan said
The Town of Victoria Park said it already had some free parking and was looking at other options.
The $1.6 billion stadium is due to open in January.

A community legal service has urged Australia's consumer watchdog to crack down on Adani for "misleading vulnerable jobseekers" with "inflated" claims its Queensland mine will create 10,000 jobs.
Environmental Justice Australia (EJA), acting for Townsville jobseeker Chris McCoomb, has referred the Indian miner to the Australian Consumer and Competition Commission (ACCC) over its jobs spruiking.
The case comes more than two years after the Land Court of Queensland found Adani had inflated its figures by almost 700 per cent.
EJA has called on the ACCC to investigate and stop public "representations" by Adani that "lead vulnerable jobseekers", including possibly remote Indigenous residents, to spend thousands of dollars on training for "jobs that will never exist".
Mr McCoomb's 17-page complaint names at least one Queensland mining training outfit that is using Adani's "inflated figures ... to promote sometimes costly training courses and certifications" to cash-strapped jobseekers.
That company advertises a one day "mining induction course" for $650.
Amid doubts about financial backing for the Carmichael coalmine, Adani has stuck by its claim the project will create 10,000 "direct and indirect jobs", including in newspaper advertisements last month and its online jobs portal.
State Opposition Leader Tim Nicholls repeated the figure during the Queensland election campaign, while Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull went even further by claiming in April Adani would generate "tens of thousands of jobs".
That is despite state Land Court president Carmel MacDonald finding in 2015 Adani had significantly "overstated" its job figures in court evidence and to the State Government.

Ms MacDonald rejected Adani's modelling showing "the number of Queensland jobs generated by the mine alone to be over 10,000 [full time equivalent] jobs per annum from 2024".
She instead accepted testimony by Adani's own expert witness the project would "increase average annual employment by 1,206 jobs in Queensland and 1,464 jobs in Australia".
Adani launched a public relations campaign this year to counter mounting opposition to Australia's largest proposed coal mine, which relies on job creation for Queensland's struggling mining belt as its key pitch.

Mr McCoomb, a volunteer coordinator with the Australian Unemployed Workers Union, said Adani had "created a lot of false hope, particularly up here in the north".
"We have to ensure there's honesty in what Adani's saying. Those claims are repeated in the media by politicians and that's creating a false sense of hope," he said.
"Towns like Bowen in particular are really banking on the project going ahead.
"I suppose it's created a fair bit of excitement in relation to the potential for employment.
"At the same time, we know that the figures Adani are throwing around out there aren't consistent with what [their expert] told the Queensland land court."
Mr McCoomb said mining industry hopefuls had to complete "a number of courses" before being eligible for work. One course he took cost $1,200.
EJA lawyer David Barnden told the ACCC "the evidence for misleading and deceptive conduct ... is strong".
"Our client is concerned these representations are misleading and will lead vulnerable jobseekers in Australia to heavily invest in training for jobs that will never exist," he said.
"ACCC is urged to take action to prevent the continued dissemination of Adani's misleading or deceptive statements that are directed at jobseekers.
"Vulnerable jobseekers should not be misled into spending money or training courses or certification without the true number of expected direct and indirect jobs being published by Adani."
An ACCC spokesman declined to comment on the Adani complaint.
The agency can act on misleading claims in business via enforceable undertakings, legal action and fines.
EJA called on the ACCC to intervene on the same issue in 2015 when acting for progressive lobby group GetUp, months before the Land Court ruling.
The watchdog invited GetUp to pursue its own legal action.
But Mr McCoomb, the AUWU and "the large number of unemployed workers in regional Queensland who may also benefit from the ACCC's investigation ... do not have the resources to pursue legal action", Mr Barnden said.
He said the matter met ACCC criteria for a priority investigation, including "conduct involving issues of national or international significance [and] detrimentally affecting disadvantaged or vulnerable consumer groups", including possibly "Indigenous consumers living in remote areas".
An Adani spokesman could not be reached for comment.

Australia's top chief executives earn an average of $4.75 million — or 78 times more than the average Australian worker.
The stark finding comes from corporate adviser Conrad Liveris, who has examined the remuneration of executives at Australia's 100 biggest public companies.
But that's not all.
Here's how the gap between total average remuneration for ASX100 chief executives compares to average weekly earnings.

Mr Liveris says Australian corporations' approach to executive remuneration is outdated, as it's based on a model created for corporations in the 1980s and 1990s.
"It's barely been reviewed for decades even though the business environment has changed.
"In this time of change and innovation, decision makers need to better analyse the contributions being made to their corporation's performance and examine how they can share the benefits more widely."
Australians' wages are stubbornly stagnant, but it's a quite different story for CEOs.
Over the past couple of years, CEO remuneration has climbed 46 per cent more, year on year, than average Australian incomes.
Mr Liveris believes corporations need to align increases in executive remuneration to Australia's Wage Price Index, in an effort to win back trust in the country's biggest businesses.

You might assume that women who become CEOs have broken through the glass ceiling. But even at this level, there remains a large gap in earnings.
And keep in mind: there are only seven women leading ASX100 companies.

The highest-earning woman CEO is Susan Lloyd-Hurwitz from Mirvac, who took home a total package of $5.3 million.
That compares to Alan Joyce from Qantas, the top-earning man who is earning $24.6 million.
Notably, though, some women executives who hold other positions are out-earning their fellow CEOs. For example:
"The highest paid men in the ASX100 tend to be group chief executives, while women tend to lead business units," Mr Liveris explains.
Alan Joyce from Qantas may have received the highest total remuneration package, but Wesfarmers' Richard Goyder took home the highest salary.

Former foreign minister Bob Carr says he has been assured that no Chinese investors will help Adani's controversial Carmichael coal mine in remote central Queensland.
Mr Carr has been lobbying Chinese organisations against the project on behalf of the Australian Conservation Foundation for the past three weeks.
Two large Chinese banks this week ruled out involvement in $21.7 billion mine, which is facing major financing hurdles after Australia's major banks announced they would not be investing.
"There's been a significant number of [Chinese] financial institutions and they've said, after looking at it, they're not going to invest money into Adani," Mr Carr said during a telephone interview from Shanghai.
Mr Carr declined to detail who or what institutions he had been speaking to in China about the project, nor at what level of seniority the various representatives were.
"I've been talking to both government and financial institutions at a level that makes me confident there will be no financial support for this project," he said.
Last month Chinese media reported that officials from the country's top economic planning body met Australia's Trade Minister Steve Ciobo in Cairns, fuelling speculation that Chinese state banks could salvage the project.
In September, Mr Ciobo and the Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce wrote to the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) to vouch for Adani and to 'welcome' Chinese investment.
The ABC sent a list of questions to the NDRC about the possibility of Chinese funding for the coal mine but they went unanswered.
Opponents of the mining project last week claimed they had been assured by the Chinese embassy in Canberra that any lenders seeking to invest in it would need central government approval, and that no applications had been received.
This came after Adani insiders claimed the Indian-led company had secured Chinese financial backing.
"Environmental concerns are a matter of the highest priority [for China's Government]," said Mr Carr, who also heads up the Australia-China Research Institute at UTS in Sydney.
"So they automatically respond to arguments about carbon emissions, and in addition they are astute enough to see in a flash how dubious the financial implications are."
Adani has on numerous occasions pushed back the start date for the mine.
Adani previously claimed it would have finance in place by the end of this year and, later, said it expected to finalise finance by the end of the Indian fiscal year in March.

Russia has designated Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) and Voice of America (VOA) as foreign agents, a move aimed at complicating their work in retaliation for what Moscow says is unacceptable US pressure on Russian media.

The classification against the US media outlets is part of the fallout from allegations that the Kremlin interfered in the US presidential election last year in favour of Donald Trump.
Russian politicians rushed through the necessary legislation last month and President Vladimir Putin signed off on the measures on November 25.
Russia's justice ministry said in a statement on its website that it was now formally designating the US government-sponsored stations, along with seven separate Russian or local-language news outlets run by RFE/RL, as "fulfilling the role of foreign agents."

The new designation means the outlets will be subject to the same requirements that are applied to foreign-funded non-governmental organisations under a 2012 law.
Under that law, the agents must include a mention of their 'foreign agent' designation in any information they publish or broadcast to Russian audiences.
They also must apply for inclusion in a government register, submit regular reports on their sources of funding, on their objectives, on how they spend their money, and who their managers are.

They can be subject to spot checks by the authorities to make sure they comply with the rules, according to the 2012 law, which has forced some NGOs to close.
Of the seven other outlets, one provides news on Crimea, which Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014, one on Siberia, and one on the predominantly Muslim North Caucasus region.
Another covers provincial Russia, one is an online TV station, another covers the mostly Muslim region of Tatarstan, and the other is a news portal that fact-checks the statements of Russian officials.
The US probe into Russian interference in the US election targeted former Trump campaign team member Michael Flynn at the weekend, after the first charges were filed in October.
Russia's Kremlin-funded RT TV station was registered with the US Justice Department last month as a foreign agent, following a demand from Washington.

Amid the hype that Amazon would severely disrupt Australia's retail industry, two e-commerce businesses have joined forces in an elaborate deal to protect their market positions.
One of them is Catch Group — better known for its online retail shops Catch of the Day (which has since been shortened to "Catch"), Grocery Run and Mumgo.
Catch also became the new owner of Pumpkin Patch after it bought the failed retailer's brand and intellectual property back in March.
The other party to this deal is Lux Group, which owns the discount luxury travel business Luxury Escapes.
Some cynical observers see this as a desperate alliance between two competitors trying to protect themselves from Amazon.
But Lux and Catch see Amazon as an "opportunity" more than a threat.
The conundrum is "Lux's strength is not Catch's strength, and vice-versa", Lux's co-founder Adam Schwab told the ABC.
Lux (in addition to its travel business) sells products online, through its websites Brands Exclusive and TheHome, which is an area Catch is better at.
Meanwhile, Catch also runs online travel sites (BonVoyage and Scoopon Travel), an area in which Lux has the competitive advantage.
"Why don't we focus on what we do really well?" Mr Schwab said.
Therefore, Lux purchased BonVoyage and Scoopon Travel from Catch — while Catch acquired Brands Exclusive and TheHome.
Simply put, both companies negotiated a deal over seven months and conducted what appears to be an asset swap, which took effect on Tuesday.
After one grapples with Lux and Catch buying each other's travel and product businesses, the other element of the deal is forming a 50/50 joint venture (JV) called "Lux Everyday".

This JV combines the ownership of their numerous deal-of-the-day websites — Scoopon (which was owned by Catch), plus Cudo, Livingsocial, Deals.com.au and New Zealand-based TreatMe (which was owned by Lux).
They are now owned equally by the two companies as part of the "Lux Everyday" JV.
As for why those brands should not simply be merged (to reduce duplication), Mr Schwab explained: "Each website has its own very loyal customer base".
"I might be a life-long Cudo member, and you might be a life-long Scoopon member.
"When you merge brands, you can lose a lot of customers who were happy with the previous brand, and may not like the new brand."
Although the co-owners of Lux and Catch did not disclose the value of this complicated deal structure, it is estimated their combined annual revenues exceed $600 million.
Lux and Catch denied there were competition concerns arising from their deal, based on the legal advice they received.
"The travel market is dominated by huge overseas players in the travel space such as Booking.com, Expedia, Wotif," Mr Schwab said.
"Our $300 million turnover is a fraction of the size of these American-owned goliaths."

How about the threat posed by Amazon?
Lux and Catch denied their deal had anything to do with Amazon — despite the timing of their deal.
After all, the US e-commerce giant's soft launch was almost a fortnight ago (during the "Black Friday" sale event on November 24), and it officially launched on Tuesday.
"Amazon is a bigger threat to the retail business — not a threat to the travel business," Mr Schwab said, in regards to his own business Lux Group.
"We don't see Amazon as a threat, we see it as opportunity," interjected Catch's co-founder Gabby Leibovich.
"In the next month, hundreds of thousands of people will transact online for the first time this year in Australia.
"This is good news for anyone running an e-commerce business — we see ourselves as an Amazon alternative ... the number two to Amazon."
"We are cherishing the arrival of Amazon because it will grow the pie, and we believe we will grab a bigger share of it."

Former Tasmanian environment minister Matthew Groom kept his most senior Cabinet colleagues in the dark about a public sector email scandal involving a department head, it has been revealed.

Yesterday the ABC reported the then-head of the Tasmanian Parks and Wildlife Service resigned after allegations of interference with a tender process.
Peter Mooney left the public service in July with no termination payments after he emailed a company vying for the Maria Island ferry contract in 2016, with tips to improve its application.
The controversy prompted Tasmania's Department of Primary Industries, Parks, Water and Environment (DPIPWE) to refer the matter to police and the Integrity Commission, as well as suspending the tender process.
Senior members of the Hodgman Liberal Government have been scrambling to distance themselves from the matter.
Despite being one of the ministers responsible for DPIPWE, Deputy Premier Jeremy Rockliff said he was only briefed on the matter yesterday, along with Premier Will Hodgman.
"I wasn't aware, it's not part of my responsibility," Mr Rockliff said.
"I'm the minister in charge of primary industries and water, not parks and wildlife."
A government spokesman confirmed Mr Groom was informed when the incident happened in 2016, raising questions about why his cabinet colleagues didn't know.
"As is standard practice, the relevant minister was advised at the time of what had occurred and the action taken to ensure the integrity of the tender process," the spokesman said.
The police assessment of Mr Mooney's actions found no crime had been committed.
The Navigators Group, who eventually won the Maria Island ferry tender, was not the company Mr Mooney was trying to coach.

Labor spokesman Scott Bacon said he doubted the Premier and his deputy were unaware of the investigation.
"When you see a police investigation, a referral to the Integrity Commission and a senior public servant resign, there is no way the Premier and the Deputy Premier didn't know about this," he said.
"It's time for the Premier to come clean on this scandal within the public service."
Greens leader Cassy O'Connor said she was uneasy about the level of government assistance to private interests.
"I think we are looking at a cultural problem here, where there is too close a relationship between Government agencies at the behest of their political masters and private developers," she said.
"It's always a problem when private interests are given an entree to Government, or an insight into Government or access to public assets without the public knowing."

The Reserve Bank has left interest rates on hold at a record low 1.5 per cent, with analysts expecting the first rate rise to be almost a year away.

The cash rate has been on hold since it was last cut in August 2016.
The decision to leave rates on hold was anticipated by every economist surveyed by Bloomberg and financial comparison website Finder.
Signs from the Reserve Bank governor's statement again point to rates remaining unchanged for many months to come.
"The low level of interest rates is continuing to support the Australian economy," Philip Lowe wrote.
"Taking account of the available information, the board judged that holding the stance of monetary policy unchanged at this meeting would be consistent with sustainable growth in the economy and achieving the inflation target over time."
That is despite an increasingly upbeat view at the Reserve Bank about growth prospects for both the Australian and global economies.
"Conditions in the global economy have improved over 2017. Labour markets have tightened and further above-trend growth is expected in a number of advanced economies, although uncertainties remain," Dr Lowe wrote.
"Recent data suggest that the Australian economy grew at around its trend rate over the year to the September quarter.
"Business conditions are positive and capacity utilisation has increased. The outlook for non-mining business investment has improved further, with the forward-looking indicators being more positive than they have been for some time."
The Reserve Bank will get an update on Australia's latest economic performance when the ABS releases the September quarter economic growth data tomorrow.

The RBA boss also noted with approval a slowdown in Sydney property price growth, following tighter lending standards being introduced by the banking regulator APRA.
Data released by APRA today shows the dramatic effect that its regulatory crackdown has had on interest-only lending, which almost halved during the September quarter.
However, the one blight on the governor's outlook is the weak consumer sector.
"One continuing source of uncertainty is the outlook for household consumption," Dr Lowe lamented.
"Household incomes are growing slowly and debt levels are high."
For that reason, given that consumption makes up around 60 per cent of the Australian economy, the majority of analysts do not expect the Reserve Bank to start raising interest rates until late next year.
Most economists only expect one rate rise next year and 10 out of 24 analysts expect rates to remain on hold into 2019, and potentially beyond.
Some prominent analysts, such as Westpac's chief economist Bill Evans, expect rates may remain steady into 2020.
The market is pricing in a 62 per cent chance of a rate rise by the end of next year, amid strong jobs growth this year, especially in full-time work, signs that the mining bust is near an end and business investment in other sectors is finally picking up.

A regulatory crackdown to limit risky lending has resulted in the share of interest-only loans plunging by nearly half in just three months.

Bank regulator APRA's ADI Property Exposure data shows that interest-only lending dived 44.8 per cent during the September quarter.
Interest only loans made up 30.5 per cent of the new loans in the June quarter, but that share has now plunged to an historic low of just 16.9 per cent.
That is well below the 30 per cent cap imposed by APRA in March.
The downturn is even steeper among the big four banks, which between them account for more than 80 per cent of the mortgage market.
Their share of interest only lending has shrunk by 48.7 per cent to 16.7 per cent.
"This has been a colossal turnaround in the way banks view interest-only terms," Rate City money editor Sally Tindall said.
In March this year APRA introduced lending restrictions on banks to ease the threat to them from riskier forms of lending to pay for overheated property prices in Australia's biggest housing markets.
Two years ago interest-only mortgages represented more than 45 per cent of new loans approved by banks, but now they are less than 17 per cent.
"The move away from interest-only lending should help bring down Australia's record high household debt-to-income ratio," Ms Tindall added.
The latest Reserve Bank figures show this ratio is now 194 per cent.
The reduction in interest-only lending may also be a factor weighing on home prices in Australia's most expensive property market, Sydney, where Core Logic's index shows prices down 1.3 per cent over the three months to the end of November.
"Tighter lending standards have contributed to a moderation in dwelling price growth and turnover," wrote JP Morgan economist Tom Kennedy.
"The impacts have been most pronounced in Sydney, where auction clearance rates have fallen to multi-year lows and house price growth, on some metrics, has turned negative."
Interest-only loans reduce upfront monthly mortgage repayments, potentially allowing home buyers to take out bigger loans, but come at the cost of higher repayments and a bigger total interest bill when the interest-only period ends.

Regulators have so far had far less success with existing mortgage holders converting to principal and interest repayments, despite an increase in rates for interest-only loans.
Today's APRA numbers show that 35.35 per cent of all loans are still interest-only, a more modest 6 per cent drop over the quarter.
Rate City data shows that on average banks are charging between 30 and 35 basis points more for interest-only lending, but this has not yet encouraged a majority of existing borrowers to start paying down their debt.
Tom Kennedy warns that the investor and interest-only crackdown may also spread to new principal and interest owner-occupier loans.
"While the RBA appears somewhat content with the impact of macro-prudential restrictions on the property market, the bank is cognisant that housing credit growth continues to outpace incomes growth, which in turn is driving the aggregate household debt-to-income ratio higher," he wrote.
"We therefore remain mindful of the risk that the regulatory framework is tightened further, potentially via the implementation of borrower debt-to-income restrictions."

If you could hand-pick a reading list for Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull this summer, what would you include?
The Grattan Institute — a public policy think tank — has today released its annual suggested reading list for the PM and will deliver copies of the six books right to his door.
It includes a biography of a former prime minister, a radical account of world energy policy, and even a fictional novel set in Sri Lanka.
Grattan Institute chief executive John Daley said they steered clear of the "wonky" titles and prioritised interesting works.
"We narrow it down to the ones we think are really good reads and at the same time have something to say," he told News Breakfast.
Mr Daley said the book had to satisfy three requirements:
And while Mr Turnbull will receive the books, Mr Daley said the list was not about making a political point.
"I'd like to think that somehow if we held a general election between now and Christmas and Bill Shorten was prime minister we'd be sending him exactly the same list," he said.
"The issues would be the same, the advice would be the same, the challenges would be the same."

The biography of Australia's second prime minister sheds light on both the public image of the man, and how his personal life shaped his policies.
Written by political scientist Judith Brett, it looks at how the actions of the "father of federation" still shape politics today.
Mr Daley's message for the PM:
What's really relevant about it today is Deakin very seldom had a majority.
What he was always about was trying to craft a coalition of people to get good change to happen and he was incredibly good at it.
It's interesting that Robert Menzies described Deakin as our greatest prime minister and the reason was not so much that he advocated policies that today we would say were fantastic… but what is interesting about him was his statecraft.
He worked with all of the players to get good change to happen, and he was patient and he was clever and he sold the message.

Is slowing economic growth and increasing inequality the new normal? For Brink Lindsey and Steven M. Teles it doesn't have to be.
In Captured Economy the pair argues they have identified the reason for inequality that will "surprise both the ideological left and right". And they say they have the policies that will decrease the power that corporations hold over politics.
Mr Daley's message for the PM:
What's really interesting about this book is it's written by one person who is a libertarian — not far from Senator David Leyonhjelm — and another who is social liberal, so probably not that far away from Jenny Macklin.
And it's about what brings them together.
So I think stepping back and thinking about whether our political process been captured and to what extent can we change some of the institutions so it's harder for business interests to capture the political interests is a good thing.

Breaking The Mould tells the story of a sporting revolution taking place across Australia, as sportswomen increasingly break through the "grass ceiling".
Through interviews with pioneering women and sporting administrators, journalist Angela Pippos delves into a "seismic shift" in Australia's culture and the sport we play.
Mr Daley's message for the PM:
The message for the PM is in part to make sure we are really supporting women's sport to the extent we are supporting men's.
But then there's a kind of more interesting story as well about how is it we achieved quite radical social change, really over just about a decade.
How is it that we went from a world in which women's sport was invisible and no-one ever made the big time, to a world in which a million people watched a women's AFL game?

There's an energy revolution coming our way, writes industry observer Dieter Helm, and it will have huge implications for nations, companies and the way we address climate change.
Based on his assessment of technological advances, Helm argues that the world is increasingly moving away from oil and gas and that this will herald a shift in geopolitical power.
Mr Daley's message for the PM:
You can understand why the Prime Minister would be very focussed on the immediate problems of energy and that's entirely appropriate. But what this book is about is the long game.
We haven't had an energy book on the list for years and we always get beaten up about that.
You know, "Surely climate change is the great moral challenge of our time", which the answer is, "Yeah it is", but we haven't had a book that said anything new.
This one says something new about the issue … and you suddenly think, "Oh geez, there's quite a lot of big changes coming".

Social researcher Rebecca Huntley has spent years travelling the country and conducting interviews to discover that while Australians can be pessimistic about our future, there's actually a lot to be positive about.
Still Lucky delves into what social changes Australians want to see, and exactly how they think our politicians will go about achieving them.
Mr Daley's message for the PM:
I think it's very easy in today's environment to get depressed and what this book says is, "No, don't get depressed".
Actually, we have made a lot of progress and in some ways Australians are still very optimistic about their country and actually their biggest fear is that their politicians won't get them there.
They're nervous that their political leadership won't get them the future they want.

This novel by Miles Franklin-winning author Michelle de Kretser is set in Sydney, Paris and Sri Lanka and weaves multiple narratives to tell a story of intimacy and our flawed perception of others.
From the woman who pines for a married lover, to the writer longing for success, and a Sri Lankan man trying to forget the tragedy of his youth, the book explores very human emotions.
Mr Daley's message for the PM:
Mr Turnbull, make sure you read one really good novel and have a good time, because you can have a very good time reading this book.
This asks a really profound question about what is a life well-lived.
And no matter what area of life you're in it's worth stepping back and asking that question every so often.

Australia's second biggest iron ore miner Rio Tinto believes it will be a big winner from China's increasing demand for high-grade iron ore, but it could spell trouble for the likes of Fortescue Metals.
Beijing's crackdown on inefficient and polluting mills, and a restructuring of the steel industry, has led to a significant shift in iron ore demand.
Rio Tinto's iron ore boss Chris Salisbury told ABC's The Business that this trend was showing up in a growing price gap between high and lower grade ore.
"We've seen the discount grow from 30 per cent in the first three quarters to over 40 per cent," Mr Salisbury said.
A recent note from Deutsche Bank highlighted how Fortescue's stocks have been growing at an increasing rate and late last month stood at 39 days of production.
In contrast, BHP's and Rio Tinto's stood at 10 days.
Some analysts believe this could be temporary, relating to reduced Chinese demand leading into winter — but Mr Salisbury disagrees, pointing to the political push for cleaner, more profitable production.
"All of this is providing evidence we believe that this is an ongoing phenomenon — so structural in nature."
So who is going to buy low grade iron ore if the Chinese don't?
"That's a very interesting question, because we've seen the stockpiles of low grade ore at the port just increasing and it's almost like you can't give it away," Mr Salisbury told the program.
"So it is a real challenge if you're in that particular market sector.
"We have the flagship product in the market today; our Pilbara blend product is flagship product for China, it attracts a premium over and above the 62 per cent iron index, which is the key indicator."
Despite some concerns about the level of debt in China and questions about how the Government will continue to maintain growth without overheating the economy, Rio Tinto does not see too many problems ahead.

"While Rio Tinto remains optimistic about China in the medium to long term, there could be a slowdown over the next six months, with a weakening in construction, infrastructure and automotive demand growth during that period," its chief executive Jean-Sebastian Jacques told investors.
In its latest economic forecast, the Reserve Bank warned the slowdown could be more prolonged, noting "demand for iron ore and coking coal is expected to moderate in coming years."
But Mr Salisbury told The Business that will not apply to all miners.
"You should be asking what iron ore we're talking about," he said.
"We have seen demand for high-grade constant.
"We are still selling all of our high-grade ore, yet low grade is piling up on the wharf."
He also reaffirmed Rio Tinto's drive for value over volume, meaning it is unlikely to ramp up production to meet the growing demand for higher grade ore, preferring to keep supply tight and reap the rewards for shareholders.

Barry Swann returned to Tip Top's western Sydney depot in April 2009 after a long night delivering bread to stores and supermarkets in the city's outer suburbs.
He often worked 14-hour shifts, seven days a week, but he still struggled to make ends meet.
He would fall behind with truck repayments and could not afford to pay another driver to do his delivery run.
His family said he had not had more than a couple of days off in three months.
Another Tip Top driver, Tony Parsons, told 7.30 he was present when Swann complained to a Tip Top manager of having chest pains.
Mr Parsons said Swann asked for help with his delivery run but was rebuffed by the manager, who said there was nobody to help him.
After finishing his shift that morning, Swann got into his car and was driving out the gate of the Chullora depot when he suffered a heart attack.
Swann called a friend to pick him up. He had another heart attack in the car and was pronounced dead when they arrived at Bankstown Hospital.
"I still don't know why he didn't call an ambulance," his stepson Sven Morris told 7.30.
Mr Morris also drives trucks for a living and knows how demanding the job can be.
"On numerous occasions I used to, after working my jobs, go out on the run with him," Mr Morris said.
"He was just knackered."

7.30 has revealed that several Tip Top delivery drivers in New South Wales were suffering from extreme fatigue and financial stress.
Some warned the pressure of the job could lead to an accident or worse.
7.30 has spoken to other Tip Top delivery drivers who have recently worked up to five months straight without a decent break.
The company said it was not aware of drivers working "without breaks and does not endorse such activity".
It said as independent contractors, the onus was on them to manage fatigue and employ relief drivers.
Swann's daughter-in-law, Renee Morris, has no doubt that plenty of delivery drivers are dangerously fatigued.
"Let them have a break," she said.
"Don't work them to death."

While repeated pay cuts have taken a heavy toll on Tip Top drivers, the company said it was facing "challenging market conditions" and "operational changes" were needed to "ensure Tip Top remains competitive and sustainable in a highly contested industry".
For delivery drivers such as Ian James, the cuts to his pay rate had a devastating impact.
A Tip Top delivery driver for almost a decade, James was diagnosed with lung cancer in 2014.
Vicki James said her husband's pay packet had already shrunk by more than $1,000 a week before he got sick.
"Tip Top would just say, 'Well, these are the costs. It's costing us more, so therefore we have to pass on to the drivers and therefore the wages were decreased'."
While he was undergoing chemotherapy, James had no choice but to employ a relief driver.
By that point he was no longer making any money from his delivery run.
"He didn't have anything to survive on and when you've got cancer, there's a lot of bills to pay," Ms James said.
In May 2015, Tip Top came to Ian James with a new proposal.
According to his wife, Tip Top wanted to almost double the number of outlets he delivered to, something she said, would have made his run longer and ultimately unprofitable.
"They came out to our house to put extra pressure on him," Ms James said.
"When Ian said, 'You're sending me into insolvency, I can't do this,' the attitude was, 'Well, that's it, sorry. You take it or leave it.'
"Surely there was another way they could have done things."
Having already had his pay slashed and facing the ongoing costs and stress of chemotherapy, James chose to give up the delivery run.
A month later he was back in hospital and he died in August 2015.
"[Tip Top] sent me flowers the day of his funeral. They were lucky they didn't get them back because I was so disappointed and disgusted," Ms James said.

Both families believe that Tip Top must take more responsibility for the welfare of its drivers.
"They've got to look after their drivers if they want to keep their reputation," Ms James said.
Since 7.30's first story early last month, Tip Top has announced it is conducting an internal investigation and says it takes the issues raised seriously.
Mr Morris thinks unless there is major changes, it is likely more delivery drivers will die or go bankrupt.
"It's as simple as that," he said.
Tip Top declined 7.30's requests for an interview and would not answer questions about these cases.

Australian retailers have received some rare and welcome good news as they confront the threat from Amazon, with a bigger than expected bounce in sales during October.
Local shopkeepers have been struggling with a shrinking retail pie over recent months at the same time as overseas competitors enter the market trying to take a share of it.
The latest challenge is Amazon's Australian website launch this morning, with the global online shopping giant offering products across 23 categories and trying to take a big slice of the nation's $300 billion-a-year retail pie.
However, the Australian Bureau of Statistics data for October showed retail sales rose 0.5 per cent in that month, and September was revised up from flat to 0.1 per cent growth, showing shoppers are again spending more.

But it was not all good news, and certainly not for some shopkeepers.
The October figures beat modest analyst expectations (+0.3 per cent) but were driven by a big surge in cafe, restaurant and takeaway food sales (up 1.7 per cent) rather than shopping.
The best retailing categories in October were footwear and personal accessories (up 2.5 per cent), electronics (up 0.8 per cent), department stores (up 0.5 per cent) and supermarkets (up 0.5 per cent).
On the flip side, the peak in the housing market appears to be weighing on furniture and hardware sellers.
Newspapers and books also continue to be out of favour, with monthly sales plunging 2.3 per cent.
Things are more likely to get worse than better for retailers, according to ANZ senior economist Jo Masters, who points to the continued slowdown in new home building and intense competition.
"We continue to see headwinds for discretionary spending given the challenging combination of weak wage growth, record indebtedness, price rises for non-discretionary goods and services and more recently slowing house price growth and rising petrol prices," she wrote.

Economists are warning people with home loans to brace for an interest rate rise, but probably not until around this time next year.

The Reserve Bank meets this afternoon for the final time in 2017 and all economists surveyed expect the official cash rate to stay on hold at 1.5 per cent.
But many borrowers have already faced rising mortgage costs this year, especially those with investment and interest-only loans, as banks try to limit demand in these areas to comply with regulatory limits.

While the cash rate is likely to stay where it is for some time yet, only one economist surveyed by Bloomberg is still forecasting further rate cuts, while a majority say rates will rise by the end of next year.
TD Securities, which looked through the Bloomberg data, is expecting two rate hikes — one in May and another in November.
Most economists only expect one rate rise next year and 10 out of 24 analysts expect rates to remain on hold into 2019, and potentially beyond.
Some prominent analysts, such as Westpac's chief economist Bill Evans, expect rates may remain steady into 2020.
The market is pricing in a 62 per cent chance of a rate rise by the end of next year, amid strong jobs growth this year, especially in full-time work, signs that the mining bust is near an end and business investment in other sectors is finally picking up.
QIC chief economist Matthew Peter is one of the 33 analysts surveyed by financial comparison website Finder, who all expect rates to remain on hold today, and most of whom expect them to remain steady well into 2018.

"The economy still contains sufficient slack to keep underlying inflation at low levels," he told Finder.
"The RBA will need to keep rates on hold well into 2018 to support our export and import competing sectors, which are currently the drivers of growth."
These sectors are currently benefitting from a lower Australian dollar, which has recently retreated from above 80 US cents to 76 US cents as investors bet on quicker interest rate increases overseas, while Australia keeps rates on hold.
A lower currency makes Australia's exports relatively cheaper and imports into the nation relatively more expensive, shifting demand towards domestic goods and services.
Profits and wages figures out yesterday from the Australian Bureau of Statistics showed that company profits remain strong — down 0.2 per cent in the quarter, led by a slide in mining profits, but up 26.9 per cent over the year to September at $318 billion.
Wages continue to lag company profits, but a combination of rising employment and hours worked offset weak pay growth to see total earnings going to staff rise 1.1 per cent last quarter.
Analysts will be closely watching the Reserve Bank governor's post meeting statement for the latest subtle hints about whether RBA board members are starting to turn their minds towards rate increases, and closing them towards further cuts.

Although the passing of the Republican tax bill boosted Wall Street's blue chips stocks overnight, Australian shares are likely to start the day weaker.

US stocks ended the day mixed, after the US Senate voted in favour of the tax reform bill on Saturday, by a slim majority of 51 to 49.
The next step is for the Senate and House of Representatives to reconcile the differences in their respective bills, before it can be presented to US President Donald Trump for signing.
One key difference for them to address is whether the proposed corporate tax cuts will take effect immediately or in 2019.
Fresh records were set by the Dow Jones index, which lifted 0.2 per cent to 24,290.
Although the S&P 500 traded higher for much of the day, it ultimately ended 0.1 per cent lower at 2,639.
But the hardest hit index was the Nasdaq, which fell by 1.1 per cent to 6,775.
The technology sector was sold off as investors repositioned their portfolios to favour financial and industrial stocks.
Bank of America shares surged by 3.5 per cent to an almost decade-high, while Boeing's share price jumped 2.4 per cent to its highest levels ever.
The Australian dollar has fallen by 0.2 per cent to slightly under 76 US cents.
It has also fallen against the British pound (-0.7pc) and euro (-0.5pc).
Iron ore prices have surged by almost 3.7 per cent to $US72.68 US dollars a tonne, which should boost local mining stocks today.
In economic news, The Reserve Bank board will meet for the last time this year later.
While the RBA will not raise interest rates today, the outcome of its meeting could still affect the Australian dollar's movements.
In addition, the Bureau of Statistics will release its October retail sales figures.
Reuters-polled economists predicted retail sales will rise by 0.3 per cent, but the results in the last three months have been weak — consistently falling below market expectations.
The ABS will also release its September quarter current account figures.
"We look for net exports to have contributed 0.3 per cent points to growth and we expect government spending to also be positive, supported by higher levels of infrastructure spending," said NAB's director of economics David de Garis.

When Nyrie Stringer was injured after falling from the back of her supermarket delivery truck onto bitumen, her boss's reaction was not what she had hoped for.
"I was lying in the middle of the road and my boss was worried that her day was ruined," she said.
"It was a case of 'Oh why did you do this to me? You've made it so difficult, today is so hard already and now we've got to deal with you injuring yourself'."
Ms Stringer said in addition to the pain from her injury, she soon had to deal with the "humiliation" of having her male manager aged in his 60s sit in on an appointment with a company doctor that her employer insisted she attend.
While her injuries were not as serious as she feared — and doctors at Fiona Stanley Hospital said her strained and bruised back and neck would likely recover with rest — she said her employer, whom she did not want to name, had other ideas.
Ms Stringer said after she lodged a claim for workers' compensation, the company put her on light duties tidying the store instead of giving her time off, and sent her to a company doctor.
"So I went to the work doctor, I had to give this person who I've never met in my life my medical history with the store manager present, which they said had to happen because they had to witness what the doctor was saying," she said.
"I didn't know that I had any input or any choice in this.
"I felt very backed into a corner and signed off on the forms because they said I had to.

"And of course you just do it because you don't want to lose your job, you don't want to cause trouble."
She said the doctor put her on a return-to-work plan and told her to take paracetamol for her pain.
She continued to perform nine- and 10-hour shifts tidying the store, but said although she was on restricted duties — meaning no heavy lifting or repetitive bending and lifting — these activities were impossible to avoid.
Ms Stringer believes the outcome would have been different, and her recovery faster, had she been allowed to see her own GP, whom she believed would have been given her time off to rest and ensured physiotherapy was covered as part of her claim.
"It was so embarrassing … it was humiliating and all this time I could have been seeing my own GP," Ms Stringer said.

According to Unions WA, Ms Stringer's experience is not unique.
Assistant secretary Owen Whittle said there had been an upturn in the number of workers complaining about being sent to company doctors, and of company representatives attending medical appointments with injured workers.
"This is something that should never be occurring," he said.

"There is no good reason for an employer representative to be in attendance during a medical appointment.
"The only reason someone will be inside a medical appointment taking notes is to potentially use that information later down the track against the worker.
"The kind of privacy breaches that could occur and the compromising of care in these situations is just too great."
Unions WA recently put out a survey to its members, asking about their experiences in the workers' compensation system.
Of the 1,052 respondents, almost one in eight had made a claim for compensation.
Of those, 11 per cent reported that their employer had sought to be or was represented at a medical assessment for a claim.
A total of 16 per cent reported feeling pressured by their employer or their insurer, 12 per cent described the experience as stressful and not worth it, and 10 per cent claimed they felt bullied and stigmatised after lodging a claim.
Unions WA said the survey results strengthened its argument for greater protections to be written into legislation, including ending the practice of employer and insurance representatives attending medical appointments with injured workers.

Industrial Relations Minister Bill Johnston said the issue would be considered as part of a review of workers' compensation laws, due early next year.
However, Chamber of Commerce and Industry chief executive Deidre Wilmott defended the use of company doctors "to give employers certainty about what tasks the employee can and cannot carry out safely and what is the best pathway to support their return to work as efficiently as possible".
"This is best achieved by a company doctor or local medical centre — family or personal GP's can be difficult to get an immediate appointment with, and company doctors who are familiar with the workplace and nature of work may be able to better understand the occupational context on an injury," she said.

US retail goliath Amazon has officially launched its Australian operations and will expand the local online product range to more than 20 consumer categories.

The highly anticipated announcement comes as traditional bricks and mortar retailers David Jones, Myer, Harvey Norman and JB HiFi brace for expected tougher competition from Amazon's Australian onslaught.
Amazon's Australian marketplace covers 23 categories including books, computers, music, clothing, accessories, home improvement, consumer electronics, kitchen goods and baby products.

In a move certain to fuel competition from traditional retailers in the leadup to Christmas, Amazon will offer free delivery on orders over $49 with a one-day service in select areas.
In a carefully planned announcement, Amazon Australia's country manager, Rocco Braeuniger, said Amazon would be offering "millions" of products from well-known Australian brands as the company enters the $300 billion retail market.
"By concentrating on providing a great shopping experience and by constantly innovating on behalf of customers, we hope to earn the trust and the custom of Australian shoppers in the years to come," Mr Braeuniger said in a statement to the ABC.
Customers buying on the Amazon Australia platform will have their goods shipped from a "fulfillment centre" at Dandenong South in Melbourne's outer east which was converted from a 24,000-square-metre warehouse earlier this year.
Mr Braeuniger said Amazon was committed to Australia for the long-term and wanted to become a significant part of the Australian economy and retail sector.

"Over time, we will create thousands of new jobs and invest hundreds of millions of dollars in Australia," Mr Braeuniger said.
"The result will be an ever-improving customer experience driven by the regular introduction of new products and services that we hope customers will love."
Amazon — the world's biggest online shopping company — had been expected to open in Australia last month to coincide with the Black Friday shopping promotion the day after the Thanksgiving holiday in the United States.



The entry of Amazon into Australia is likely to pressure local online players like Kogan, JB Hi Fi and Ebay, with other major players forced to lower prices in the face of the toughest trading conditions since the 2007 global financial crisis.
Amazon has been tight-lipped in the leadup to the Australian launch and until now has provided few hints about its Australian marketplace strategy.
The company says "thousands" of Australian businesses will be using Amazon's local platform to sell their products but would not provide a specific number.

However, Amazon says globally about half of the company's sales come from marketplace sellers.
In addition to its Australian online site, the company has corporate offices in Sydney, Melbourne, Perth, Brisbane and Canberra employing more than 1,000 staff.
Amazon is valued at US$560 billion and recently bought Whole Food Markets in the US as part of its online supermarket arm, Amazon Fresh.
However, the ABC understands Amazon has no imminent plans to open Amazon Fresh in Australia, which would provide direct competition to Coles and Woolworths who are already under pressure from Aldi and Costco.
Australian Competition and Consumer Commission chairman Rod Sims said last week Amazon's arrival in Australia would be positive for consumers but conceded local traditional retailers could become damaged.

New data reveals just how long it takes you to save for a home in every area across Australia — from the good, to the bad and the very ugly.

The stark contrast between Australia's east and west coast housing markets has been laid bare in new data which reveals it now takes Sydney first-home buyers twice as long to save a 20 per cent deposit for a median-priced home than punters in the post-mining boom city of Perth.
The data is sourced from the Australian Bureau of Statistics, the census and property monitoring firm CoreLogic, and compiled by Bankwest.

The figures used in the study, compiled for every Local Government Area (LGA) in Australia, have been calculated based on ABS income data of the average combined salary for two people aged between 25-34, saving 20 per cent of their pre-tax income in a high-interest savings account.
The study tells a tale of two cities, with Perth now the most affordable mainland state capital, taking just 3.9 years for first-home buyers to save a deposit.
It is a far different story in Sydney, where buyers require 8.2 years to save a deposit — well above the national average of 4.6 years.
Just five years ago the situation was the reverse.
Perth property prices were booming, fuelled by the state's mining industry.
But since the sector stalled in 2012 values have been in decline, falling a further 4.3 per cent over the past financial year alone while Sydney prices have jumped 11 per cent.

New South Wales is home to eight of the nation's top 10 LGAs where it takes a first-home buyer couple the longest time to save.
Sydney buyers need on average 8.2 years to save the $215,133 deposit required to purchase a median-priced house, three years longer than the national capital city average of 4.9 years.

When regional areas are included, the average saving time reduces to six years.
New South Wales boasts the lowest proportion of first-home buyers, who account for just 8.1 per cent of total sales.

Across the country in Perth, more than a fifth of total buyers in the 2016/17 financial year were purchasing their first home, fuelled by falling house prices.
It now takes around 3.9 years to save the $103,046 deposit for a median-priced home, one year less than the national average.

When the entire State is taken into account, the saving time falls to 3.6 years.
Despite a post-boom economy in decline, Perth retains the title of the most unaffordable LGA — Peppermint Grove — where it would take 21.2 years to save a deposit of $673,000.

Melbourne remains the second-most expensive property market in the country, but is rapidly gaining ground on its northern neighbour with prices rising 14.2 per cent during the 2016/17 financial year.
First-home buyers looking in the city need to save for 6.4 years to amass the $153,008 deposit for a median-priced property, an increase of eight months on last year.

Despite strong prices and weak wages growth, the introduction of stamp duty concessions on properties up to $750,000 boosted the first-home buyer market, recording a 3 per cent rise in buyers for the year to August 2017.

Queensland's market has remained relatively stable but has recorded a massive 11.2 per cent jump in first-home buyer purchases, driven by the extension of a $20,000 grant for new homes until the end of the year.
Brisbane buyers take on average 4.5 years to save the $105,950 deposit for a median-priced property, largely in line with last year's figures.

The holiday town of Noosa trumped Queensland's State capital, reporting a 13.6 per cent rise in house prices during the period.

It takes just over $90,000 to lay down a 20 per cent deposit on a house in Adelaide, the lowest of any mainland state, but only one in every 10 properties are sold to first-home buyers.
That is driven by the state being home to the oldest population demographic after Tasmania, and the fact people aged between 25-34 have the second-lowest average wages in the country of just $51,629.

Adelaide first-home buyer couples require 4.2 years to save the $90,665 deposit on a median-priced property, a figure largely unchanged from last year.
Just under $78,000 will secure you a 20 per cent deposit on a house in Hobart, while a little over $60,000 will be enough to help you buy outside of the city.
Prices in Hobart rose 8.6 per cent over the period, but the average saving time of 3.8 years to save the $77,812 deposit remains the lowest of the state capitals.
Perth couple Dirk Black and Isabelle Southern have been putting money away since finishing university.
"[We started saving] once I had stable work, not necessarily with the intention of buying a house, but making sure I had some sort of savings together," Mr Black said.
Four years on, and at just 26 years of age, they pooled their funds to snag their first property five kilometres east of Perth's CBD, taking full advantage of Perth's plummeting house prices.

"I think [the market] definitely had a positive influence. I guess it pushed us to act a little bit quicker rather than wait another 12 months [or] a year and a half down the track," Mr Black said.
"It took roughly four years because we pooled our funds together," he said.
"I went back to uni and then I got a part-time job last year, so that's when I was putting more aside. We're not really big spenders so that's helped," Isabelle Southern said.

"Across the country we're seeing very different markets and across the 421 local government [areas] we're seeing very different markets," Bankwest general manager of personal and small business banking, Donna Dalby, said.
"The accessibility for first-time buyers to get into the market varies greatly."
"Western Australia, or Perth in terms of capital cities, is one of the most accessible markets.
"Some of the reasons for that is that house prices have fallen in the Perth market … we're coming out the other side of the boom, we're in the production phase of the mining boom which isn't as labour-intensive."

Alistair and Penelope Clifton are part of the small minority in Sydney making their first purchase, but to get into the market they were forced to team up with family.
"We formed our little syndicate with the two of us and my young brother," Mr Clifton said.
"I consulted Tom — my younger brother — and said, 'Are you keen to buy a property?'
"He was keen and it made it feasible for us if there's three people paying off a mortgage rather than two."
They chose to buy an investment property first with the plan of eventually using the property's capital growth to purchase their own home.
"We will get to a point where … we're renting no more, but I can't see us buying a home in the next 10 years," he said.
"That's why we bought this investment property and hopefully we might be able to buy another one in the next 10 years and then maybe sell them.
"Then we both split up and and then we might be able to have the money to buy our own house."

Katherine residents are being warned not to eat local seafood and other home-grown produce after an interim report into PFAS contamination identified them as potential health risks.
The Department of Defence released details of an interim human health risk assessment for the Northern Territory town on Monday outlining potential exposure pathways to the community.
Most of the town is in the investigation area.
The chemicals, an ingredient in firefighting foam once used at the nearby Tindal RAAF Base, have seeped into Katherine's bores used for drinking water and irrigation.
The interim report said initial findings indicated a number of activities could pose a risk to residents:
"We did find that in the fish samples that we've taken they have triggered what they call the trigger values in the food standard Australia and New Zealand thresholds," Steven Grzeskowrak from Defence said.
"That means it's appropriate to start looking at limiting intake of, in this case, fish from Katherine river."

The trigger value for PFOS in fish flesh is 5.2 micrograms a kilogram and is based on a child between two and six years old eating 500 grams of fish a week.
Compared to the trigger value, barramundi that were tested returned between 12 and 42 micrograms, up to six times the safe level.
Cod and catfish contained between 6.2 and 88 micrograms, up to 17 times the value.
Other fish had the broadest range, between 9.5 and 350, a maximum of 70 times the trigger value. When asked what fish were included in the last group, a Defence representative said it was varied but could not provide detail on which particular fish had the highest concentration.
Mr Grzeskowrak said in terms of vegetables, the concentration of PFAS was higher in leafy greens.
"The uptake into fruits has been very low or nil in many cases," he said.
"The uptake into leafy green vegetables tends to be higher."

The Department also noted the testing was done during the dry season, when bore water use is at its peak, so it could give results that were "worst case scenario".
It also recommended that people avoid or minimise their contact with the activities or, in the case with fruit, vegetables and seafood, combine it with goods from a non-contaminated source.
But the Department said their testing of incidental exposure from digging in soil or coming into contact with dust contaminated with PFAS was not considered an exposure pathway.
Similar advice was given to Darwin residents in 2016 when the chemicals were found in shellfish in Ludmilla and Rapid Creek, but were later found to be safe for consumption.

Defence also said the report informed a recent decision to offer a $5.7 million support package to Katherine residents, which included voluntary blood testing, funding for counselling services, and an epidemiological study.
Local and State Government representatives lobbied to have the services available in the town for months, including the Chief Minister writing to the Prime Minister asking for blood tests.
The Department did not detail for how many years residents may have been consuming the toxic chemicals, which have been linked to a number of conditions in animal studies including some types of cancer and low birthweight.
The United States Environmental Protection Agency has said there may be a correlation between PFAS consumption and adverse health effects in humans, but Australian authorities maintain there is currently no consistent evidence that exposure to PFOS and PFOA causes adverse health effects.

There have been violent scenes in Melbourne where controversial British commentator Milo Yiannopoulos was speaking.
Heavily armed police were forced to intervene when protesters clashed outside the Melbourne Pavillion in Kensington shortly after 6:00pm.
At least two people were arrested, with police standing guard outside the venue where Yiannopoulos was hosting three shows on Monday.
Police used capsicum spray when the violence broke out.

One of the protesters fell to the ground and was bleeding during the incident.
A police officer was also struck by a rock and received minor injuries.
Both left and right groups were chanting and holding placards.
Neil Erikson from far-right group Patriot Blue said he was at the protest to defend free speech.
"We were basically coming to the Milo event and we were attacked so we had to defend ourselves," he said.
Chris DiPasquale from the campaign against racism and fascism said his group "want to send a positive message".
"We're against racism, we're against sexism, transphobia, homophobia, everything that Milo stands for we're against that," he said.
The venue of the sold-out shows was kept secret to those who purchased tickets until the last minute, due to concerns about protests.
The right-wing commentator has made a career out of attacking feminism, political correctness and Islam.
A book by Mr Yiannopoulos was cancelled after video resurfaced which showed him speaking positively about sexual relationships between boys and men.
He was permanently banned from Twitter in July last year for calling Ghostbusters actress Leslie Jones a "black dude".
Last year, universities in the US cancelled speaking events hosted by the far-right commentator because of security concerns. Protesters lit fires and smashed windows when he was due to speak at a Californian university earlier this year.
His Australian speaking tour began in Adelaide on Friday and finishes in the Gold Coast on Thursday.

A regional airport in south-east New South Wales has had its air services reduced after months of conflict with the region's main airline over a $50 million expansion of air and sea transport facilities.

The project aims to boost the region's tourism industry by extending the Merimbula airport runway to take bigger planes, while the Port of Eden wharf will be extended to take bigger cruise ships.
The federal and state governments funding the project see it as vital to the region's economic development.
But Regional Express (Rex) said it saw the airport development and others like it as a "folly" that could put airline out of business.
Rex, which is the sole carrier on the Sydney to Merimbula route and the main carrier on the Melbourne route, does not want the airport runway to be extended.
Earlier this year, the airline warned airport owners Bega Valley Shire Council that it might reduce or even withdraw its services if the development went ahead.
The airline said the development is unnecessary and "a cavalier exercise" that will lead to the council charging Rex with higher airport usage fees because the council will need to cover increased operating costs.
Warrick Lodge, the general manager of Rex network strategy, said Rex's opposition is not restricted to Merimbula.
"We do have serious concerns in regard to regional airports … embarking on expansion plans that are unnecessary and over and above what the airport requires," he said.
Rex provides air services to 55 regional airports from Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne and Perth.
Mr Lodge said that the cumulative costs across their network as a result of developments such as at Merimbula would make their business unsustainable as it operated on very slim profit margins.
He said Rex is not opposed to competition, but that the development is unnecessary because the passenger numbers using the airport are not sufficient to sustain any competition.

The Sydney to Merimbula route was de-regulated earlier this year which Mr Lodge pointed-out had failed to attract interest from other airlines.
However the mayor of Bega Valley Shire Council, Kristy McBain, said that it is inevitable that the airport will be required to take larger aircraft at some time in the future, and that funding was available now.
"It's about gearing up and making sure that we're ready for that when it does happen," she said.
Ms McBain said that Rex would not be hit with higher airport fees because the council had a special rate variation to cover ongoing costs.
Furthermore, she said that the development of both the airport and the Port of Eden would be catalysts for increased passenger numbers that would make it sustainable to service the region with larger aircraft.
Rex operates a fleet of Saab 340 aircraft, seating 34 passengers, which ceased production in 1999 that Rex said will be adequate to provide services for the next 15 years.
But former Bega Shire mayor and now-tourism operator Michael Britten said the Rex aircraft and business model are designed to service business commuters and are not suitable for tourism market.
"You need to have a plane with a bigger capacity and also be able to take a lot of luggage that go with families when they go on holidays," he said.

The proposed airport runway extension is intended to support larger turboprop aircraft with approximately 74 passengers and greater luggage capacity.
Mr Lodge rejected what he called a "build it and they will come" approach.
"We've had considerable issues with a number of regional airports that are spending in excess of $15 million to upgrade their airport … with no commitment at all from any of the larger carriers to provide any more services that Rex already provides there," he said.

A decorated Tasmanian public servant resigned over allegations of interference with a tender process for a ferry service, a matter which was referred to Tasmania Police, the ABC can reveal.
In an email seen by ABC News, the former head of Tasmanian Parks and Wildlife Service, Peter Mooney, contacted a company vying for the Maria Island ferry contract with tips to improve its application.
The late-night message, sent not long after the tender process was announced in April 2016, said:
"You will need to suggest what additional services beyond the standard ferry service you can provide or collaborate with. Could even suggest eventual collaboration with PWS (Parks and Wildlife) to run the accommodation in the Penitentiary and Coffee Palace."
The email even went as far as to talk down the then-ferry operator, who was also competing for the contract, and suggest the application make "mention of intention" to work with the local school.

"We know that school(s) want to get to Maria Island but find it difficult with the current attitude of the present ferry operator," Mr Mooney wrote in the email.
"I will have another think and come back to you with more suggestions."
In a statement, Department of Primary Industries, Parks, Water and Environment (DPIPWE) revealed the matter was investigated.
"The allegation was referred to Tasmania Police and the Integrity Commission was advised," the statement read.
"On 15 June 2016, Tasmania Police advised the department that following review it appeared that no crime had been committed and there was not the need for investigation by Tasmania Police."
DPIPWE said Mr Mooney "tendered his resignation from the public service on 10 June 2016".
The statement said Mr Mooney was "paid his entitlements" but no other termination payments were made.
When contacted for comment, Mr Mooney responded with a short text message.
"I retired from the public service July last year," it read.
"I believe the matter you refer to was appropriately resolved."
Independent Upper House MP Ruth Forrest said the correspondence was entirely inappropriate.
"It's interference in a tender process," she said.
"Any potential ferry operator should have free opportunity to put forward their case without fear that it's being somehow subverted."
Despite a wide-ranging internal investigation, Premier Will Hodgman was only briefed this morning after his office was contacted by the ABC.
"The process was suspended when it was apparent there was an issue," he said.
"A party that was not part of the initial area of concern was successfully awarded the tender."
The company Mr Mooney was contacting was not the eventual winner of the tender, the Navigators Group.
DPIPWE has also said upon learning of the allegation, it put in place a range of measures, including ensuring Mr Mooney was removed from the tender process.
It also gave all participants the opportunity to resubmit their application and the final assessment was reviewed by a procurement panel.

Crown Resorts' shareholders have launched a class action against the gambling giant for a sharp drop in its share price following the arrest of 18 employees in China.
Law firm Maurice Blackburn alleges shareholders in James Packer's company suffered losses when Crown shares dropped almost 14 per cent after the staff were detained for "gambling crimes" in police raids in October last year.
The Federal Court statement of claim alleged Crown breached the Corporations Act by failing to make timely and accurate disclosures to the market about the risks it was taking in China and engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct about Chinese market growth.
The employees, including Australian executive Jason O'Connor, pleaded guilty to the crime of promoting gambling in China in June.
Maurice Blackburn's head of class actions, Andrew Watson, said Crown took a gamble amid Chinese government warnings that it intended to crack down on foreign casinos marketing to its citizens on the mainland.
"Shareholders should have been apprised of the risks that Crown was taking in China and the threat they posed to the company's revenue streams," he said.
"Chinese authorities could not have made the risks of marketing gambling any plainer to Crown or other casino operators, yet Crown ignored these warnings."
The share price plunged 13.9 per cent, from $12.95 to $11.15 following news of the arrests.

The class action covers individual and institutional investors who bought shares between February 6, 2015 and October 16, 2016.
Crown has vowed to vigorously defend itself.
The arrests were a blow to Crown's plans for Sydney's Barangaroo casino, which was promoted as a venue for wealthy gamblers — known as VIPs — many of whom come from mainland China.
Legal documents show Crown reported annual VIP revenue worth more than $1 billion, but VIP turnover at its Australian casinos fell by 49 per cent in the past financial year.
In a separate Federal Court case, Crown and pokies manufacturer Aristocrat are being sued by former gambling addict Shonica Guy who claimed the Dolphin Treasure machine was deceptive and misleading.
Crown has also rejected whistleblowers' claims staff deliberately tampered with poker machines at its Melbourne casino to gouge more money out of gamblers and circumvented anti-money laundering laws.

The Government and major banks were staunchly against a royal commission until it became all but inevitable that an inquiry would happen with or without their imprimatur.
That has led many to question whether the terms of reference have been designed to reduce the scope of the commission in a way that limits the amount of wrongdoing that might be uncovered.
"It is carefully crafted to avoid a lot of the potential bear traps," said banking analyst Martin North from Digital Finance Analytics.
"It's probably the one you have to have, I'm not sure it's really going to add much to the real debate and I'm not sure the outcomes will be really significant."

CLSA banking analyst Brian Johnson concurs the terms of reference are weaker than what Labor, the Greens and some dissident Nationals had in mind.
But he also noted the extensive and compulsive investigative powers of royal commissions tend to mean they turn up surprising findings — the "unknown unknowns" as former US defence secretary Donald Rumsfeld famously put it.
"If it doesn't actually turn up anything that we don't know already then it is really a waste of time," Mr Johnson said.
"This does provide a mechanism for aggrieved parties to basically purge themselves, so that's where the risk basically lies [for the banks]."
The Government's main argument against a royal commission is that it has already held a range of inquiries and undertaken a number of reforms to improve financial sector regulation and accountability.
Martin North agrees a lot of progress has been made.
"Over the last 18 months or so, there have been a whole series of improvements in the regulatory framework in and around banks," he said.
"A lot of the things that should have been done have been done already."

Mr North cited the Productivity Commission review of so-called vertical integration (where banks cross-sell a wide range of products and services to their customers), the ACCC's investigation into bank price setting and the Banking Executive Accountability Regime as examples.
However, Mr North said the biggest elephant in the room remains largely ignored.
"The critical question for me is about lending, and about lending standards," he said.
"I have a view that we are at a very early stage of understanding just how far from where we should have been have the lending standards been … that is the real black hole at the moment."
Mr North said there may be a ticking time bomb of bad loans that could turn into rising defaults over the next three to five years.

"If you look at the lending standards today and you compare them to two or three years ago, there are many people holding mortgages today who would not now have got those mortgages," he said.
"But I also believe that even today, the lending standards are still too loose and there are households today who are able to get mortgages and committing to mortgages that they shouldn't be getting."
Mr North said there was also a lot more to be discovered in the areas of financial planning and mortgage broking.
"I also think that we've still got some questions around the conflicts of interest, for example, from mortgage brokers and financial advisers and how they back-end into the overall financial services sector," he said.
"Those are the two things that I think are the critical issues but I don't think either of them will get touched very hard in this review."
Mr Johnson said another key issue that may not be examined in the royal commission is the economic fallout of having such large, super-profitable major banks.
"The 10-year bond rate is something like 2.6 per cent and we've got banks doing an ROE [return on equity] of about 15 per cent, which is amongst the highest in the world," he said.
"That high level of profitability, perhaps that is a tax on the rest of the economy."
While the terms of reference give relatively broad scope for Kenneth Hayne to take a wide looks across the financial sector, he has only been given a year to do so.
This is slightly less than the Northern Territory royal commission investigating youth detention.
It is almost a full year less than the Trade Union Royal Commission, which was extended from nine months to nearly two years at the request of commissioner Dyson Heydon who found there was insufficient time to complete his inquiry into half a dozen trade unions.

This inquiry is intended to look at hundreds of financial companies, many of which are worth well over $1 billion and each sell hundreds of individual products.
Given the number of victims of the financial scandals the public have been made aware of, the royal commission looking at institutional responses to child sexual abuse may provide a better guide of how much time is needed for a genuinely thorough inquiry.
It was originally intended to take two years, however it was extended to four years due to the sheer volume of victims' stories that needed to be told.
As for bank claims the bad publicity and possibility of new scandals arising from the royal commission would push up overseas funding costs and therefore mortgage interest rates, Mr Johnson is sceptical.
"The cost of three-year and five-year money is back down at the low points of the cycle," he said.
"It certainly would be more driven by what we see happening in credit markets generally than this idea that suddenly investors would desert the Australian banks.
"I just think that's over-hyping it and it's a somewhat convenient argument."
Mr Johnson said where Australians choose to park their savings is a much more important factor for lending interest rates than whether international investors are investing.
"The funding costs for the Australian banks are far more sensitive to deposit pricing than they actually are to wholesale funding," he added.
Ironic in light of the latest scandal, exposed by Ben Butler in The Australian, where the major banks rolled term-deposit customers over into much lower interest rate products after their initial deposit matured without adequate warning that this would happen.

A Melbourne real estate company has been fined for a second time for underquoting properties.

The Federal Court has fined Hocking Stuart Doncaster $160,000 for underquoting nine houses for sale in Melbourne's north-eastern suburbs.
The franchisee admitted to false and misleading conduct charges bought by the director of Consumers Affairs Victoria.
It follows a fine of $300,000 imposed on Hocking Stuart Richmond for underquoting last year.
In the latest matter the court heard that between June 2014 and December 2016, Hocking Stuart Doncaster deliberately advertised nine properties at price ranges lower than the homes would sell for.
The court heard realtors told owners underquoting was a technique designed to attract buyers, which would in turn drive up the sale price.
"In many cases it had been instructed by the vendor that the property was not available for sale at the price estimated," Justice Bernard Murphy said.
A Doncaster homeowner agreed to sell for $810,000, the property was then advertised for $790,000, before selling at auction for $1.01 million.
In 2015, Hocking Stuart Doncaster also advertised a Templestowe home for $1.7 million and above, despite the owner wanting $1.8 million to $1.9 million.
The home sold for $2.04 million at auction.
The court heard underquoting was a widespread practice in the industry, but Consumer Affairs Victoria found only nine out of 25 sales investigated involved underquoting.
"Hocking Stuart Doncaster's conduct was plainly deliberate," Justice Murphy said. "It was intended and as apt to create the illusion of a bargain."
The agency was facing a maximum penalty of $9.9 million for breaching consumer law, but the judge agreed to a lesser penalty as the business only made a small profit as a result of its conduct.
Hocking Stuart Doncaster was ordered to pay $160,000 plus court costs, and to implement a three-year compliance order.
Between December 2016 and July 2017, six other Victorian real estate companies accepted enforceable undertakings for underquoting, paying a total of $240,000 in penalties.

After a nine-month search, Rio Tinto has picked former investment banker Simon Thompson to be its new chairman from March 5, next year.
The British-born Mr Thompson, 58, will succeed Jan du Plessis, who has been the mining giant's long-standing chairman since 2008.
Rio did not have too look far.
Mr Thompson is currently the chairman of the company's remuneration committee, having joined the company's board as a non-executive director in 2014.
"Mr Thompson has over 20 years' experience working across five continents in the mining and metals industry," Rio Tinto said in a statement on Monday.
This includes senior positions at global miner Anglo-American, and board positions at AngloGold Ashanti, Rusal and Newmont Mining Corp.
He has also been the chairman of multinational private equity firm 3i Group (since 2015) and Tullow Oil, a British oil and gas exploration company with extensive operations in Africa (from 2012 to 2017).
Earlier in his career, Mr Thompson worked at British investment banks SG Warburg (which is now a part of Swiss-based UBS), and N M Rothschild (which is controlled by the wealthy Rothschild family).
"I look forward to leading the board as we work with J-S [Jean Sebastien-Jacques] and his team to ensure that Rio Tinto continues to deliver superior returns for its shareholders by maintaining its capital discipline and 'value-over-volume' approach," Mr Thompson said.
Though one of Mr Thompson's most important future tasks will be dealing with the US corporate regulator, which has charged Rio with fraud.
The Securities and Exchange Commission alleges the company, along with its former CEO and chief financial officer, tried to cover up more than $US3 billion worth of losses on a failed coal investment in Mozambique back in 2011.
Rio is also being investigated by the UK Serious Fraud Office for "suspected corruption in the conduct of business in the Republic of Guinea".
Mr du Plessis, 63, joined Rio Tinto during a mining industry slump during the global financial crisis back in September 2008.

Four months before he became chairman, Rio Tinto's ASX-listed shares were trading at $155.35 per share (at May 16, 2008) — but by early December, the mining giant's shares had plunged by nearly 80 per cent to $32.
Rio's share price has since recovered to $71.80 (at 12:40pm AEDT).
When the South African executive announced his intention to leave Rio in March, he was offered a job with another industry giant in a very different sector — British telco, BT Group.
Mr du Plessis became a non-executive director of BT's board in June and started work as its new chairman in early November.

Matt Ormiston knows his 12-year-old son Joshua will face challenges throughout his life that his older sisters won't, especially when it comes to getting a job.
Joshua is on the autism spectrum, and his father is part of a growing movement to help people with autism find employment that they will excel in.
Mr Ormiston is the director of the ANZ Spectrum Program, and the bank is currently hiring its inaugural intake of employees on the spectrum.
"That won't only just help my children, but will help other people's children who are also going to face into those same sort of challenges that I expect Josh will as he comes into that place of working life," Mr Ormiston said.
"It really starts to put you in a position after 20 odd years of working around the world in technology, to say here's something that I can really leave a legacy."
Currently in Australia only around 40 per cent of adults on the autism spectrum are employed.
Those who  do find employment are often working in jobs below their educational or professional level.
But that could be beginning to change.
ANZ has become the latest major company to deliberately recruit people with autism.
Nine new employees are due to begin work early next year: four in cyber-security roles, five as test analysts.
The banking group insists the initiative is not driven simply by a "feel-good factor".
"There's a real untapped pool of potential here in the autistic community," Mr Ormiston said.
Autism researcher Professor Cheryl Dissanayake from La Trobe University said cyber security in particular was increasingly recognised as "a very good fit" for many people with autism.
"The attention to detail, the looking for information, for detailed information, for variations in code, is critical," she said.
"And many people with autism have very good skills to bring into that."
While the ANZ program is starting out with an intake of just nine employees, it is hoped it will expand significantly.
"We're really looking to be able to dream much bigger, and look at opportunities right across the ANZ," Mr Ormiston said.
The ANZ program is modelled on a similar initiative which has been running for several years at DXC Technology, formerly Hewlett Packard.

DXC's Dandelion program now employs close to 60 people in Adelaide, Canberra and Brisbane, many of them working in Federal Government departments, including Defence, Human Services and Immigration and Border Protection.
It is the brainchild of executive Michael Fieldhouse who said he had an "epiphany" one evening while watching a friend's son, who has autism, throw pebbles into an urn at a dinner party, an action that initially frustrated him.
By eventually timing him Mr Fieldhouse realised that the boy was dropping the pebbles at exact intervals.
"He did that for a bit over two hours," Mr Fieldhouse said.
"I learnt that night that talent actually comes in all shapes and sizes.
"I saw raw talent not being utilised."
Twenty-four-year-old Martin Ribot de Bressac is one of the employees on the DXC program.
Before being hired by DXC, he struggled to find full-time work.
"A big barrier that I find is the interview process and being able to connect with the other side of the interview," Mr de Bressac said.
"It's very anxiety-ridden talking to someone that I've never met before, I felt like I could not perform at all."

Starting out in his new job in automation was not plain-sailing either.
"I was having self-esteem issues thinking I'm not really doing a good job and not really saying the right thing, and everyone at work is judging me because of my anxiety and because of my Asperger's," Mr de Bressac said.
Almost two years on his confidence has grown enormously — in fact, he is thriving.
"I find that when I'm given a task that I can just demolish it way, way quicker than a lot of my peers," he said.
"I'll hack into a piece of software, completely understand the deep roots of it and then build something out of it I get to the point where I can do crazy things with technology."
Co-worker Kayne Weir, 20, has also been with DXC Technology overseeing IT systems for close to two years.

He too still struggles with the social aspects of the workplace, but said he and his family are "ecstatic" that he has employment.
"It's good money, it's good work," he said.
"I'm happy is what they see."
The DXC program is monitored by researchers at the Olga Tennison Autism Research Centre at La Trobe University, who will also be involved in the ANZ program.
The Centre's Director, Professor Cheryl Dissanayake, said one of the hardest things for people on the spectrum to manage in the workplace was downtime.
"I think they do much better when the workflow is consistent and there's work to do," she said.
"I think it's also important for the co-worker to recognise that this isn't going to be the person who gossips at the water cooler, but rather someone who does need a constant workflow and does need very clear communication."

Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has said his country will launch a cryptocurrency to combat a US-led financial "blockade", although he provided few clues about how the economically crippled OPEC member would pull off the feat.
"Venezuela will create a cryptocurrency … the 'petro', to advance issues of monetary sovereignty, make financial transactions and overcome the financial blockade," Mr Maduro said during his weekly televised broadcast.
The digital currency will be backed by Venezuelan reserves of gold, oil, gas and diamonds, he said during the near five-hour show, which included traditional Christmas songs and dancing.
"The 21st century has arrived!" Mr Maduro added to cheers, without providing specifics about the currency launch.
Opposition leaders scorned the announcement, which they said needed congressional approval, and some cast doubt on whether the digital currency would ever see the light of day in tumultuous Venezuela.
"It's Maduro being a clown. This has no credibility," opposition politician and economist Angel Alvarado said.
Still, the announcement highlights how US sanctions this year are hurting Venezuela's ability to move money through international banks.
Mr Maduro's move away from the US dollar comes after the recent spectacular rise of bitcoin, which has been fuelled by signs that the digital currency is slowly gaining traction in the mainstream investment world.

Cryptocurrencies typically are not backed by any government or central banks.

Bitcoin already has a strong following among tech-savvy Venezuelans looking to bypass dysfunctional economic controls to obtain dollars or make internet purchases.
Venezuela's traditional currency, meanwhile, is in freefall.
Currency controls and excessive money printing have led to a 57 per cent depreciation of the bolivar against the dollar in the last month alone on the widely used black market.
For the millions of Venezuelans plunged into poverty and struggling to eat three meals a day, Mr Maduro's announcement is unlikely to bring any immediate relief.
Economists and opposition leaders say the leftist Mr Maduro, a former bus driver and union leader, has recklessly refused to overhaul Venezuela's controls and stem the economic meltdown.
He could now be seeking to pay bondholders and foreign creditors in the currency amid a plan to restructure the country's major debt burden, opposition leaders said, but the plan is likely to flop.

Before Australia adopted some of the strictest smoking regulations in the world, advertising cigarettes was big business.
Ad agencies have long sought the clients with the biggest budgets — and from the 50s to the 70s, the clients with the biggest budgets were selling tobacco.
They set out, and succeeded, in convincing Australians that smoking was a suave, sexy and sophisticated thing to do.
Slim cigarettes were tailored for "the feminine hand". Craven was "the clean cigarette that's kind to your throat", and Benson and Hedges was for "when only the best would do".
But one campaign was so successful that it backfired — prompting the backlash that ultimately saw Australia ban tobacco advertising altogether.
By the early 1970s, there were already warning signs about the risks to consumers' health. But teenagers were a lucrative target market, and one brand in particular resonated: Winfield.
Allan Johnston, a new creative at Sydney agency Hertz-Walpole, was asked to come up with an idea for Winfield, then owned by the company Rothmans.
"We came up with this crazy idea to put Paul Hogan in a dinner suit and take the piss out of other cigarette ads," Johnston said.
On the day of the shoot none of the usual executives turned up. They were terrified and thought it was going to be a disaster.
Hogan arrived in his tuxedo. The Sydney Symphony orchestra was brought in. And in his ocker drawl Hogan began: "G'day. I've been asked to talk to ya, and being the suave, sophisticated man about town…"

Australians loved it. Especially the kids. "It was brave — actually naïve," Johnston said.
After the first week on air, Rothmans chairman Sir Ronald Irish ordered that the "uncouth bloke" be taken off air, but was then reminded that the company were now selling a million sticks a day.
Not long after, Winfield overtook Marlboro as Australia's number one selling cigarette.
The popularity of Paul Hogan and his Winfield ads among teenagers was a worrying development.
Winfield became their preferred brand, and Hogan's powerful resonance with kids saw them take up smoking at a growing rate.

Health campaigners and public sentiment were getting more vocal. The link between tobacco and lung disease could no longer be ignored.
By the mid 1970s, there was increasing pressure on the government to act.
The new Whitlam government pledged extra funds to state health departments, so they could engage in the very medium that had propelled these tobacco companies into peoples' lives in the first place. Anti-smoking television advertisements began.
Adman John Bevins was approached by the NSW Department of Health, and asked to come up with a hard-hitting anti-smoking ad that was to be trialled on the NSW North Coast.
The first thing he wanted to know was why cigarettes were so bad. He was put in touch with public health expert Garry Egger, who told him: "The lung is like a sponge, it's designed to soak up air but a smoker's lung soaks up smoke instead."
The ad wrote itself. The campaign was a huge success, greatly reducing smoking, and was rolled out across the country.

Tobacco advertising was officially banned on Australian radio and television in 1976, though it remained legal on billboards for some years to come.
BUGA UP — an acronym for Billboard Utilising Graffitists Against Unhealthy Promotion — continued the fight after holding their first public meeting in October 1980.
They used humour and satire to drive their message through careful and often minimal billboard touch-ups.
Blocking out several letters of "Benson and Hedges", for example, produced "Be on edge", while "John Player Special" could be changed to "Lung Slayer Special".

As a new pole of anti-tobacco radicalism, BUGA UP drew attention to the morality of cigarette advertising. Funds from public support helped pay the fines of those who were arrested.
It inspired similar movements in Canada, the United States, and the United Kingdom, where London-based group COUGH UP emerged.
It was a struggle where David finally beat Goliath. Billboard tobacco advertising was banned across Australia in 1993.

With complaints about phone and internet providers soaring, consumer groups are calling for the troubled sector to be regulated the same way as the water or energy industries.

In a letter to Communications Minister Mitch Fifield, consumer advocates say a review of the Telecommunications Consumer Protection (TPC) code is industry-dominated, lacks independence and is being rushed.
The letter has been signed by the Consumers Federation of Australia, CHOICE, Consumer Action Law Centre, Financial Counselling Australia, Financial & Consumer Rights Council (FCRC) and COTA Australia.
The TCP code governs the way the providers advertise, sell, and handle complaints and debt, but the consumer groups say the Government needs to better regulate the sector.
"The telco regulation is out of step with consumer protections in other sectors like energy and financial services and it was time for the Federal Government to act," FCRC executive officer Sandy Ross said.

The consumer advocates say the rise in customer complaints is the result of industry "self-regulation".
In the last financial year, complaints to the Telecommunication Industry Ombudsman shot up by 41 per cent and complaints about the National Broadband Network jumped 159 per cent.
Under the Universal Service Obligation only standard landlines and payphones have to be accessible.
The consumer groups want Australia to follow Canada's lead which declared broadband internet a basic telecommunications service last year.
"Members of our community cannot pay bills, get important information, or remain socially connected without access to working telco services," Consumers' Federation of Australia chair Gerard Brody told the ABC.

Legal services are reporting an increase in disputes about telcos selling multiple, unaffordable and inappropriate contracts to disadvantaged and vulnerable people.
Melbourne pensioner Elizabeth, 70, who did not want her surname used, is recovering from cancer and has been housebound for the past two years.
She wanted the internet so her mind could escape her four walls.
However, for the past seven months she has been fighting with Telstra after signing up for a bundle internet and landline service that she hasn't been able to use.
"I would have internet access at best for a couple of days, but usually it would drop out after a few hours," she told the ABC.
"The thing is when it dropped out so did my landline and I need a phone for medical emergencies."
Elizabeth said she spent hours with technicians who never fixed "the blasted box" and was also signed up for a premium service that she couldn't afford.
"They would charge me for things they told me I wouldn't be charged for. No two accounts from Telstra are the same," she said.
Communications Alliance communications CEO John Stanton says the review isn't industry-dominated, pointing the participation of representatives from the peak communications consumer body, ACCAN, industry regulators, government officials and the ombudsman.
"The claims made in the letter are inaccurate," he told the ABC.
"The TCP code process is not a self-regulatory process — it is a 'co-regulatory' process."
Mr Stanton said the code would be enforceable on all providers and says it is neither rushed nor perfunctory.
In a statement, a spokesman for Senator Fifield said all industry codes were enforceable by the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) and telcos could face court penalties.
Telecommunications provider FuzeNet was the latest company to be singled out by the ACMA for not properly managing customer complaints, but no penalty was issued.
Senator Fifield's office said the CEOs of all major retailers and the NBN have agreed to improve the customer experience when it comes to the NBN.

One of Australia's leading authorities on the superannuation system has accused bank-run super funds of "looting" workers' retirement savings for profit, and criticised the Federal Government's "bizarre" targeting of the not-for-profit industry super sector.

Wilson Sy was formerly head of research at the Australian Prudential Regulator Authority (APRA), which oversees superannuation funds, and principal adviser on the 2010 super system review (the Cooper Review) which resulted in major reforms of the industry.
He said it was ridiculous that the Government is trying to force changes on the "world's best practice" industry super fund model which has persistently and consistently delivered significantly higher returns for members than the retail funds run for profit by banks and big financial conglomerates.
"The industry funds have averaged 2 to 3 per cent better [than retail funds] over a period of 20 years," he said.
Over the same period, retail funds have delivered "about four and a half per cent" after fees and charges but before tax, which is "about the same as cash", said Mr Sy, who recently analysed two decades of official data.
"I think it's looting," he said.
"Retail funds are there to make profits for shareholders. Basically, they treat their members as consumers to which they sell some sort of financial product."
The Government is hoping to pass legislation on superannuation fund governance before the summer break, with Parliament set to debate the government's bill this week.
The legislation would require that at least one third of the trustees on a super fund be "independent".
This would force many industry funds to abandon the "equal representation" rule, under which the trustees of a fund are made up of equal numbers of employer representatives and representatives of the workers who are fund members, usually nominated by unions.
"The reform is important because independent directors bring different skills and expertise and they can hold other directors accountable for their conduct, particularly in relation to conflicts of interest," the explanatory memorandum for the bill says.

But Mr Sy says the independent director requirement, which is already in place at most bank-run funds, has failed spectacularly to prevent workers' retirement savings being eroded by excessive fees and has failed to overcome blatant conflicts of interest.
Trustees of superannuation funds that are run for profit by banks and other financial services firms face an "inherent conflict of interest", he says, because they are required under Corporations law to serve the interests of the shareholders who own the fund and required under superannuation laws to serve the interests of the funds' members.
The consistent and persistent underperformance of retail funds showed that the conflict has generally been resolved in the interests of shareholders.
Independent directors of retail funds are generally finance professionals schooled in making profits from workers' retirement savings, Mr Sy said.
It was naive to think that they would serve the interests of members at the expense of profits for the financial institution that owned the fund.
He also said that few so-called independent directors, drawn from financial services firms that provided services to banks or the super funds they own, would risk future work by standing up for members' interests at the expense of profits.
"Members do not reward the directors," Mr Sy said.
"Directors get rewarded for serving the shareholders of the bank that owns the fund, and pays their directors fees."

Often trustees of industry super funds are members of the fund themselves and therefore had a direct interest in minimising fees and maximising returns to fund members, Mr Sy said.
"If you are a director of a super fund and have most of your superannuation in the fund that you are a director [for], you are less likely to allow higher fees to be paid to service providers," he said.
"That is called skin in the game or alignment of interest."
Forcing the new governance model on industry funds would undermine members' interests, with fewer directors aligned directly to members' interests and more finance professionals aligned to the interest of the finance industry — profiting from workers' retirement savings — he said.
"It's precisely the wrong model."
The Government has acknowledged that the legislation would impose extra costs on industry funds, largely due to the expense of hiring new directors.
The Coalition has been trying to impose the new governance arrangements for years without success, but it is believed that the Government could be close to getting the numbers after intense lobbying of the crossbenches.
Mr Sy recently wrote to members outlining his concerns.

Adani's controversial Carmichael mine has been dealt another blow after one of China's major banks said it would not bankroll the project.

Industrial & Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) issued a statement to clarify it had no intention of funding Adani's proposed mine in Queensland.
"ICBC has not been, and does not intend to be, engaged in arranging financing for this project," ICBC said in a statement on its website.
"ICBC attaches great importance to its social responsibilities and keenly promotes green financing."
While not mentioning coal, ICBC said it had provided finance in Australia "for a series of renewable energy projects".
Earlier, China Construction Bank also rejected financing links with Adani saying it "is not involved with, nor considering involvement with, the Adani Carmichael Mine project".
The anti-Adani lobby has hailed the rejection by two of China's major banks as a significant development in blocking the construction of the mine.
Market Forces executive director Julien Vincent said arranging finance from China was one of Adani's last remaining hopes given that Australian banks had walked away.
"Having failed to secure finance from banks in the US, Europe and Australia, Adani has now seen the world's largest and second largest banks by assets rule out support for its massive proposed coal mine," Mr Vincent said.
"This leaves their attempts to open up Australia's largest coal mine in tatters, and increasingly reliant on public funding."

Mr Vincent said Adani has been working to contract China Machinery Engineering Corporation (CEMC) into the Carmichael mine and rail project.
However, CEMC would potentially need to source credit and support from Chinese banks to participate in the Adani project.
Adani has, on numerous occasions, pushed back the start date for the mine.
Adani has previously claimed it would have finance in place by the end of this year and, later, said it expected to finalise finance by the end of the Indian fiscal year in March.
Global banks, including Australia's major banks, have baulked at funding the Carmichael coal mine on concerns about its financial viability and the push towards renewable energy sources.
!!!@@@$$$

A group of traditional owners fighting Adani's central Queensland coal mine have filed a court injunction against both the mine owner and the Queensland Government, hoping to prevent a National Native Title Tribunal decision on the Carmichael mine site.

The legal fate of Australia's largest proposed coal mine hinges on the tribunal registering an Indigenous land use agreement (ILUA).
After months of pressure from Adani, it is understood the tribunal has moved to fast-track its ruling and was due to hand down its decision some time this week.
The move shocked mine opponents within the Wangan and Jagalingou (W&J) traditional owners, who fear having a huge swathe of their native title claim on Galilee Basin country irreversibly struck down before the Federal Court can rule on a separate challenge to the validity of the ILUA.
Some W&J claimants have alleged in the Federal Court that Adani paid certain people $2,000 to attend a meeting and vote in favour of a compensation deal that would allow the coal mine to go ahead.
Speaking in Brisbane on Sunday for the W&J group opposed to the mine, Adrian Burragubba said they were determined to stop the tribunal handing down a decision ahead of the court ruling.
However, the W&J's 12-person native title representative group is split down the middle on the mine deal, which was revived last year after traditional owners rejected Adani twice before.

Patrick Malone, a W&J representative who supports the deal, said claims people were paid to vote for Adani were "nonsense".
The Federal Court is due to rule on the matter in March.
Mr Burragubba said 120 members of the W&J met on Saturday and voted for a fourth time to reject the ILUA.
"We will not negotiate [with Adani] any further," he said.
"No means no."
Anger over the tribunal's apparent backflip came after a letter from the tribunal sent to mine opponents and Adani in July, advising that "the registrar intends to await the outcome of the Federal Court proceedings" before signing off on the ILUA.
Lawyers for Adani immediately pushed for the registrar to approve the ILUA without waiting for the Federal Court ruling.
In papers filed with the tribunal, Adani's lawyers argued the court case was "not an administrative or legal impediment to the registration of the Adani ILUA".

They argued that formalising the deal "will not affect the relief that may be granted" by the Federal Court or the right of the mine opponents to seek judicial review if the registrar approves the deal.
The lawyers argued Adani "will be prejudiced" by further delays to the ILUA because the miner "will be prevented from acting in reliance on [it] for an indefinite and potentially long period of time".
The ILUA is critical for Adani in gaining finance for the mine, as it shows Indigenous consent without which most of the world's banks, under the Equator Principles, will not invest in resources projects.
Adani's lawyers argued it was the same situation it had experienced when Queensland mines minister Anthony Lynham approved their mining leases, despite there being ongoing judicial review of them.

Two Australian brothers behind successful YouTube channel RackaRacka, which now has more than four million subscribers, are about to make the big move from Adelaide to Los Angeles to capitalise on their skyrocketing popularity.
Twins Danny and Michael Philippou, 24, have just released their latest online clip to immediate success, a Star Wars-style battle staged in the stores and car park of an Adelaide suburban shopping centre.
The pair have mixed emotions about the move to the United States.
"It's easier for Danny — I'm not so excited moving," Michael said with a laugh.
Danny admitted he was the keener of the two to move abroad.
"I'm sort of forcing him to come along," he said.
"It could all fail, so we're going to go over there and try it for a year."
"When Danny's eight projects fail, then we'll come back," Michael cut in.

The guys already have a manager in LA who is setting up meetings about their latest projects.
Busy with video production and live appearances, the Philippou brothers are part of a rapidly changing media consumption landscape.

They have made it into a top-10 list of Australia's most influential cultural people, in the Australian Financial Review, and been named in Variety magazine's list of top "Famechangers".
It was their Harry Potter versus Star Wars clip on YouTube that shot them to fame in 2014, a clip which has been viewed more than 21 million times.
RackaRacka's early YouTube clips were made at their father's house at suburban Pooraka, from where their online name is derived, and they moved out after causing lots of wall and ceiling damage with their antics there.

They admitted their move to another house helped ease their father's anguish.
"We had to give our dad a break … he didn't kick us out, we left," they explained, finishing each other's sentences as twins sometimes do.
There are firm plans for the twins to be back in Adelaide next year to shoot their first movie, Concrete Kings, with locally based Triptych Pictures.

The WA Building Commission is expected to begin ordering the removal of highly flammable cladding from a number of buildings in the coming weeks, as it enters the inspection phase of a state-wide audit.
Termed the "business end" of the audit by director of compliance Sandy Randall, 214 buildings will be inspected to ensure they are not clad with dangerously flammable material.
Ms Randall said if extreme cases were detected it may be forced to order the evacuation of buildings, but she did not expect that to be likely, with only two evacuations ordered during a similar audit in Victoria.
"The more likely scenario is that we're going to have high-risk buildings, in which case the local governments could issue building orders on the building owners requiring that they remove the panels that are dangerous," she said.
The WA Building Commission initiated an audit of aluminium cladding in the wake of a 2014 fire at Melbourne's Lacrosse apartment building.
The initial audit was broadened into a state-wide audit after combustible cladding fuelled the Grenfell apartment tower fire in London, which claimed 80 lives.

The state-wide audit identified 460 multi-storey buildings in WA with cladding, 382 of which have been assessed.
In June the audit found an apartment building for homeless youth in Leederville did not comply with regulations.
The WA Department of Communities and Housing confirmed in October it was removing the dangerous cladding.
It was revealed this week that 214 of the assessed buildings could have highly flammable cladding and have been flagged for inspection early in 2018.
A number of builders, certifiers and building owners could face penalties if they are found to have put people at risk by installing or approving dangerous cladding out of negligence.
Ms Randall said prior to the Lacrosse fire in 2014 the industry was divided as to how cladding-related codes should be interpreted, and this would likely be taken into account for breaches detected in older buildings.
She said the Australian Building Code board had since clarified the codes and made it very clear what was and was not approved.
"If we come across a scenario where that cladding has been recommended in more recent years then certainly we will be looking at whether or not that person needs to be held accountable," she said.
"The most extreme penalty is deregistration, but one of the more effective compliance disciplinary processes is simply the naming and shaming of people.
"Other than that there are fines up to $25,000 dollars."
Ms Randall said the inspections were also likely to detect a number of additional hazards that could land building owners in hot water.
"It's very hard to walk into a building with blinkers on," she said.
"When we're looking at the cladding we will have to look at the other fire safety systems, some of them might be in relation to maintenance."
The list of 214 buildings to be inspected is likely to grow as the building commission continues to receive information from local governments, some of which is understood to be archived paper-based records that are time consuming to find.
"We're working very collaboratively with the local government and Department of Fire and Emergency Services to make sure that everyone understands the priority that needs to be applied to this," she said.
"The information will trickle in at different rates so we certainly will be delivering outcomes with some of the buildings inside of 12 months and hopefully inside of six months."
Ms Randall said the process had been helped by added pressure from insurance companies.
"They've got their own interest to protect and a number of building owners are being sort of confronted with the choice of either get a fire assessment done or your insurance premiums will be hiked quite a bit," she said.
The building commission has taken steps to ensure that if building owners engage a fire engineer the assessment satisfies the requirements of the audit as well as the insurance companies.

On the first day of the container deposit scheme in New South Wales, rural and regional residents of the state are already calling for more facilities to be made available in their areas.
NSW has become the second state after South Australia to introduce such a scheme with about 200 collection points opened for the first time this weekend.
There has been ongoing criticism of delays ahead of the rollout with some residents having to travel up to three hours to collect their 10 cents and others travelling across the border to save money.
In the north coast, Woolgoolga is the only site on the coast for recycling containers between Taree and Tweed, each about a three-hour drive away.
Further south, Wagga Wagga, Deniliquin and Cootamundra have collection points but rural residents living further west will have to drive two to three hours for a refund.
Deputy Premier John Barilaro this week asked the community to be patient and admitted the scheme was running behind schedule.
"Have we rolled out the scheme in a way that has been seamless? No. The answer is no, it hasn't been as perfect as we'd hoped it to be," Mr Barilaro said.
Environment Minister Gabrielle Upton said eventually there would be more than 500 collection points across the state.
"We're starting this scheme as a rollout. Over time we will be bringing more on board," she said.
Ms Upton advised residents living in a town without a collection point to stockpile their containers ahead of reverse vending machines being installed.

The collection points offer three ways to collect a refund from depositing cans and bottles.
Residents can select between a donation to charity, a retail refund to be spent in store or a digital refund which deposits the ten cents into a PayPal account.
Michael Harris visited Woolgoolga Woolworths on Friday and said he thought the digital option was "a bit risky".
Mr Harris said the scheme was good news for the environment but would not work properly until there were more collection points across the state.
"I walk the beach everyday and pick up rubbish off the beach — bottles and cans and stuff that's been washed up — so it will help immensely," he said.
Pam Stone used the same collection point on Friday but said it was a waste of a car park space.
"I'm paying 15 cents a can and getting 10 cents a can so it didn't make me feel all that better," she said.
Ms Stone also suggested the Government reconsider banning plastic bags as a more effective environmental strategy.
Tim Chappo from Wagga Wagga visited one of the three of the city's collection points on Saturday to empty rubbish from his ute — three empty soft drink bottles.
"I haven't set up the PayPal digital one so I got a voucher for the kids," he said.
Noelle and her daughter Taylor, who live in Wagga, said they thought the scheme would encourage people to recycle more, especially children keen to use the supermarket vouchers.
Further south down the coast at Bega, ABC reporter Bill Brown said he saw no-one using or passing by the collection point, which is on a rooftop car park away three stories above the shopping mall.

New South Wales Labor has been vocal about its opposition to the scheme, saying it should have been delayed until all collection points were established.
Labor environment spokeswoman Penny Sharpe also criticised the digital refund option saying it would deter children from using the service as PayPal requires its users to be over 18.
The state member for Ballina, Tamara Smith, said the rollout should have been delayed as it is open to rorting, as containers bought in states which do not have a deposit scheme can still be redeemed for 10 cents.
"Obviously that's not a great look for them politically, but it's far better for this to be done properly and to fully consult to iron out all the glitches," Ms Smith said.
The Member for Clarence said people were being treated as "guinea pigs" and it is obvious the rollout of the scheme should have been better planned.
Further south, Murray MP Austin Evans has criticised the rollout and said it's unfair for cross-border retailers losing customers to Victoria.

Victoria's east is still preparing for the worst of the flooding, but there is an oversupply of a different kind facing the central Gippsland community of Glengarry.
The town was prepared to host and feed more than 3,000 cyclists participating in the Great Victorian Bike Ride.
The bike event was cancelled due to heavy rain, meaning the town's weeks of preparation were for nothing.
Or were they?
Community members put a call out on social media asking Gippsland residents to come into town and eat the hundreds of kilograms of prepared food so it did not go to waste.

Glengarry Hotel hand crumbed 200 kilograms of chicken, creating about 600 schnitzels to make into parmigianas.
The publican's daughter Jacqui Barnes said the response had been overwhelming
"The chefs have been cooking nonstop for hours and hours on end," she said.
"We are very lucky we live in Glengarry, it's a very, very close-knit community.
"It's amazing to think at 5:30am we were standing here wondering if anyone was going to come or is it going to be a flop. But the support has been amazing."

At lunch time the main street of Glengarry was filled with vehicles, as was the gravel car park near the start of the Gippsland Plains Rail Trail.
"The bistro is full to the brim and the phones just don't stop ringing," Ms Barnes said.
Great Victorian Bike Ride participant John Collins, from Emerald, was taking part in the washed out event.
He did not cycle to Glengarry, but still stopped in town on his drive home.
Despite not exerting the same amount of physical energy in the transport method to Glengarry, Mr Collins still had a large enough appetite to tackle a parma.
With a plump parma sitting in front of him, Mr Collins said he was happy to have paid a visit to Glengarry.
"We thought it would be good to come here, because we'd heard that all the locals had done a fantastic job in preparing to welcome us but not many have actually arrived," he said.

It is not just the parmas that required mass consumption in Glengarry.
There was also the 100 kilograms of steak still to get through and thousands of pies at the local bakery.
The bakery had spent long nights preparing many different flavours of pies for the riders, and thought they would not be able to sell them all once the ride got cancelled.
They offered the community a two-for-one special, in a bid to try and sell them all.
They sold out by 10:30am.
Bakery owner Trevor Ewert said they had made more than 3,500 pastries in preparation for the cyclists arriving.
"It's been a community effort. We've worked between all of us, we've basically worked day and night, to make as much product as we can," he said.
"We came up with the crazy idea last night to offer buy one get one free. There's been a steady steam of customers and now we've completely sold out.
"Now we're finished up here we'll be down the pub getting a pot and parma into us in no time. I've done an eating competition before — I reckon I could smash three or four no problem at all.
"You can't be angry can you? Who controls the weather? If the Government controlled the weather you'd understand. We've succeeded, we've done what we need to do, now let's go to the pub."

Adani is accused of discreetly paying thousands of dollars to recruit people to vote on a crucial mining deal with traditional owners, including Aboriginal people with no link to its Queensland mine site.
A Wangan and Jagalingou (W&J) representative said he was paid $2,000 by Adani to boost numbers at the meeting, where he said many who were "not part of my mob" voted on the compensation deal.
Another W&J woman said her family of eight voted against the deal but the official vote recorded just one person against and 294 people in favour.

The claims are made in sworn statements filed in the Federal Court, ahead of a trial in March to decide whether the meeting legitimately endorsed the Adani deal, which has bitterly divided the W&J.
Adani and its supporters in the W&J greeted the overwhelming vote as a ringing endorsement of the Indigenous Land Use Agreement (ILUA) but opponents who boycotted the meeting say it is invalid.
Patrick Malone, a W&J representative who supports the deal, rejected the claims about the meeting as "nonsense".
The W&J's 12-person native title representative group is split down the middle on the mine deal, which was revived last year after traditional owners rejected Adani twice before.

Craig Dallen, a fellow representative who has withdrawn his support for Adani, said the meeting on the deal drew about 300 people, or "twice the size of any previous meeting of the claim group".
"I was paid approximately $2,000 by Adani to get people to the meeting. The more people I brought the more I was paid," he said in an affidavit.
Mr Dallen said "several other" representatives told him Adani also paid them to recruit people.
He said on top of this Adani paid him and others "generously" to show up, including $400 for him and $250 for each of his children for travel expenses.

Mr Dallen named members of at least eight other Aboriginal nations who were counted as W&J supporters of the mine.
"Some people I did recognise and knew them not to be part of my mob. I saw that they were given arm bands to allow them to vote and participate in the meeting," he said.
Carmel Gyemore named her cousin as another W&J representative who was "getting paid by Adani for every member of our family who turned up", including three who were absent.
She also named non-W&J people who "should not have been at our meeting".
Both said the meeting did not include the usual resolution on who could rightly attend.

Jasmin Broome said her family of eight were "seated together [and] we all voted against accepting the ILUA".
Ms Broome said she also recognised non-W&J people and filed in court a social media post from members of another family with a picture and the words: "Only come meeting for money."
Security guards at the meeting were allegedly told to refuse entry to Adrian Burragubba, a W&J man who is an outspoken opponent of the Carmichael mine, "because Adani did not want him at the meeting".
Mr Malone said votes were counted by scrutineers from a native title legal service and he was not aware of anyone being paid to recruit attendees.
He said W&J representatives "sat with an anthropologist and marked off people and made sure they were W&J".
"The people who weren't part of W&J, were given a different-coloured wristband so they could be observers and they could not vote."
Adani has previously defended the legitimacy of the meeting but a spokesman could not be reached on Friday.

A fight between a shire CEO and a cafe owner who built a kangaroo shelter inside his shop is set to continue after both sides declared they would not back down.
The CEO of the Gnowangerup Shire, Shelley Pike, issued an order to owner of the Gnowangerup Newsagency and Cafe, Phillip Vardy, instructing him to remove the animals and the room they live in.
The order was on the grounds that the enclosure breaches the Food Act and the Health Act.
Ms Pike said the Shire had taken a firm stand on the issue in writing to the shop owner with an infringement notice.
"Although we are supportive of wildlife being looked after, it's not appropriate in a business that is primarily registered as a food business," she said.

But Mr Vardy is equally determined to continue having the young kangaroos housed within the cafe.
"It all started a few weeks ago," Mr Vardy said.
"Megan, who works with me, became a carer for wild animals. A week later she got a phone call and she received two little joeys whose mother had been killed.
"They couldn't hop, they should have been in their mother's pouch. If Megan hadn't taken them they would have died.
"We had some Japanese tourists come in one day with these little kids, so Megan went home and got one of the little joeys.
"The little kids were amazed, they just couldn't believe they actually were seeing real, live, baby kangaroos."
Mr Vardy proposed building a room with a window in it within the cafe so children could watch the joeys being fed.
He said he invited the Shire's health inspector to the property, told him about the plans, and asked whether or not they would pose a problem.
"(The health inspector) said to me, 'no, I don't see any health problems'," Mr Vardy said.
The Shire contests that claim.

"That's simply not true. We've had our health inspector make several visits and he advised the owner that what he planned to do would be in breach of the requirements of the food standards required," Ms Pike said.
Mr Vardy went ahead with the construction and built the kangaroo pen inside a cool room with two air vents and exhaust fans leading outside the cafe.
"The entire area is enclosed and no one can get into the pen or touch the animals without leaving the cafe," Mr Vardy said.
The Shire has suggested that the roo room should be re-located outside the shop to the back of the premises.
"We've had just so many complaints from the community. People won't go into the shop and they're not satisfied that it's clean and they certainly won't purchase food or coffee there," the Shire CEO said.
"But tourists do, and I'm just dreading the day that we get a complaint from a tourist saying it's unhygienic."
Mr Vardy said one of the biggest issues was the installation of hot water for handwashing.
He said health regulations required hot water to be provided in areas of food preparation, not food handling.
To get around this, Mr Vardy said he had shut his kitchen and gets food prepared off-site and delivered to the cafe.
"I now buy all the cakes from the bakery in Katanning so we are now no longer preparing food, we are handling food," he said.

The Cat Cafe Puurth in Subiaco has a similar arrangement where cats are kept behind a floor-to-ceiling glass enclosure, separate to the cafe but under the same roof.
Patrons pay a fee to go into the enclosure to handle the animals, leaving their shoes outside.
Health Department rules mean the Cat Cafe can not make food on-site but will have it delivered — the same arrangement Mr Vardy has enacted.
"The policy is that we can't make food on the premises but we can make our own coffee and drinks," he said.
In a letter to Mr Vardy, the Shire CEO said he should take the matter up with the Health Department:
The issue of whether you can keep kangaroos in your shop is not a matter that the Shire can decide. This is a matter for the Health Department.
As explained in my letter, you are in breach of the Food Act which is a Health Department responsibility.
The Shire is an enforcement agency for the Health Department and we are obliged to ensure that the provisions of the Act are enforced.
You may wish to discuss this with the Health Department as they are the only ones who can waive the infringement notice.
Mr Vardy said he will shut up shop if he is forced to get rid of the joeys.
"I will shut the Gnowangerup Newsagency," he said.
"They will no longer have a newsagency. No-one can do their lotto and no-one can buy a newspaper and I don't care.
"I will not give up these kangaroos."

At first it was just a ban on single-use plastic bags, then it was helium balloons. Now it looks like scientists and environmentalists want to ban the use of glitter.
Scientists from the United Kingdom to New Zealand are now calling for a glitter ban to further address the environmental impact of plastics.
Those shiny, colourful specks of joy people use in lieu of clothing at music festivals are one of many plastic pollutants called microplastics.
A microplastic is any plastic less than five millimetres in diameter and experts say they are making their way into water systems, marine life and eventually into us.
The physical impact of plastics on animals is well documented, but scientists around the world are still trying to determine how they affect the breathing and brain function of people.

A professor of environmental engineering at the University of Western Australia, Anas Ghadouani, supports a ban on glitter.
"We don't yet know all the details," Professor Ghadouani said.
"But it's not a natural product that will morph into our system. It's not like nutrients, it's a chemical.
"If you breathe microplastics inside your lungs they don't decompose, they stay there."
Professor Ghadouani has been collecting wastewater and environmental water from systems around Perth to analyse the amount, type and origin of microplastics — including glitter.

"I have little girls and they have birthday parties, but I've mandated they only have parties every second year because it takes me two years to get rid of glitter from the last party," he said.
"I still find it in some corners of my house, so imagine what it's like in the environment."
In WA's south-west, environmentalist Carmen Kowal has been campaigning against plastics for several years.
At the helm of two organisations — one that removes litter from beaches and another that sews sustainable shopping bags for residents — Ms Kowal said glitter had just appeared on her radar.
"I've just noticed glitter in kids' bubble baths. It's in our clothes," Ms Kowal said.
"It just keeps going. It's a bit like bashing your head against the wall."
The 40-year-old recalled a recent beach clean-up in Eagle Bay where volunteers stumbled across two square metres of glitter that was impossible to pick up.
"But if it doesn't get picked up it's going to get blown into the ocean and end up in the food chain," she said.


While Professor Ghadouani and Ms Kowal are aware of the critics out there, they say the risk of name-calling is worth protecting the environment as "some fun-policing is just essential".
"Harming the environment is harming business — that's the end of the story," Professor Ghadouani said.
"The environment is what provides for us. It's where we find our resources. It's where we make our money. So harming it unnecessarily just doesn't make sense."
He added that removing glitter and other microplastics from the market will force people to come up with alternatives.
Perth-based face painter Desiree Crossing has cottoned-on to the growing demand for environmentally sustainable products.
The 35-year-old now also sells glitter online where she says about 80 per cent of her sales are in biodegradable glitters made of compostable plant matter.
Before opening a year ago, Ms Crossing said she had not even considered the fact that glitter is a plastic.
"Someone eventually told me and I just felt awful about it," Ms Crossing said.
"So, I investigated bio glitters and got some of them. They were sparkly and they were beautiful and they did everything that the regular glitters did — just without that destruction."

While she wants to eventually offer only biodegradable glitter, until it is less expensive to produce and more colour and shape variants are available she said it is not feasible.
Professor Ghadouani agreed that many environmentally-friendly options were more expensive than mass-produced plastics, but he said he was certain that choosing locally-crafted wooden Christmas decorations over plastic, glittery baubles would eventually become more affordable.
And while governments and partying might not sound like a natural partnership, Professor Ghadouani said sweeping legislation was the final frontier in removing microplastics from the environment.
"We need leadership here where people say 'listen, this is how we're going to party," he said.
"We're going to reinvent partying."

A deal to extract gas from Queensland's Surat Basin will create 1,000 new jobs, boost domestic gas supply, and unlock one of the largest gas reserves on the east coast, the resources industry says.
Arrow Energy has signed a 27-year agreement to supply more than four times the forecast east coast domestic gas shortfall to Shell's Queensland Curtis Liquified Natural Gas project every year.
Arrow Energy CEO Qian Mingyang said the company's equal shareholders PetroChina and Shell had approved the agreement, which offers long-awaited infrastructure collaboration in the natural gas industry.
"It will create better cost efficiencies and enable us to bring this gas to market in a challenging investment climate," Mr Qian said.
He said utilising existing pipelines and infrastructure would reduce the impacts on landholders and local communities.
Mr Qian said work would commence from the expansion of Arrow's Tipton fields, near Dalby, and build two new development areas from around 2021.

The Queensland Resources Council's chief executive, Ian MacFarlane, said the agreement demonstrated that Queensland was leading the rest of Australia in working to address the gas shortage.
"This one agreement alone will deliver enough extra gas to more than power Queensland's entire industrial demand every year out to 2047," he said.
He said scaling up production would help to get gas out of the ground at an affordable price.
Queensland Resources Minister Anthony Lynham said a reliable and accessible gas supply was critical.
"The Government will be interested in the company's proposals for domestic gas supply and their production timeline," he said.
"It's important for industry and jobs that more gas gets to market."

A Senate inquiry is calling for a raft of measures to secure the Australian steel industry including beefing up anti-dumping laws and certification.
The Senate's Economics References Committee handed down 28 recommendations on Friday as part of its final report into the future of the industry.
The inquiry arose after Australia's two major steelworks at Whyalla in South Australia and Port Kembla in New South Wales faced major financial issues leading to large job losses.
The report said the inquiry received "alarming evidence" around the safety risks posed by steel that did not meet Australian standards and was used in bridges, poles, caravans and safety structures on mining sites.
It found legal loopholes allowed imported fabricated steel to avoid complying with the same standard as steel made in Australia which meant local steel costed more to produce.
The recommendations included maximising the use of locally-made steel in Commonwealth-funded projects and improving resources for the Anti-Dumping Commission, which investigates alleged dumping and subsidisation of goods imported into Australia.
The Opposition industry and innovation spokesman Kim Carr said it was vital the Government committed to using more Australian steel.
"It's very important that we maintain the standards. We can't have our bridges being put up across the country and not be certain we've met the very strongest of safety standards," Senator Carr said.
The inquiry has also recommended a bipartisan solution to high energy costs in order to secure energy supply for steel manufacturers.
Bluescope Steel, which owns the Port Kembla steelworks, this week said its energy prices had risen by 93 per cent over the past two years.
The Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and Energy Minister Josh Frydenberg earlier this week used the Port Kembla steelworks as a backdrop to spruik the Government's National Energy Guarantee (NEG).

"Today the Prime Minister has come to Port Kembla to create jobs for Australia's working class men and women, and the way we will do that is by driving power prices lower."
Rock legend Jimmy Barnes leapt on those comments, tweeting:
"Don't use my name or my songs to sell your sh**ty policies. You don't represent me."
Senator Carr said there was now an opportunity for the Government to ensure steelmaking remained strong in Australia.
"We need a bit more than platitudes and vague references to Jimmy Barnes here," he said.

"We do actually need a Government that commits to buying Australian when it comes to spending taxpayer dollars."
Illawarra-based steel advocate Ian Waters said securing cheap baseload energy remained crucial to ensure the industry survived.
"When the industries are going well and the market's buoyant, it's just another cost that people probably aren't all that stressed about," Mr Waters said.
"But as soon as there's any sort of sniff or hint of a downturn, this is going to be a massive drama."

A spokesman for the Industry Minister Arthur Sinodinos said the Government would consider the recommendations of the inquiry and respond in due course.

He said steel was going through significant transition globally as it dealt with supply outstripping demand.
"Bluescope has posted a major turnaround in its business in recent years by driving efficiency within its business and working with employees to reduce business costs," the spokesman said.
"The Whyalla steelworks has recently been acquired by Liberty OneSteel, and both the state and Turnbull governments are working with Liberty OneSteel to secure Whyalla's long term future.
"The Turnbull Government has already significantly strengthened Australia's anti-dumping regime by improving the process of conducting reviews of dumping measures by the Anti-Dumping Commission."

Australia's property market has reached a turning point, with smaller cities taking more of a front row seat in the growth story.

CoreLogic's monthly figures show the capital cities with the biggest property price increases in November were Canberra (+0.9pc) and Hobart (+0.6pc).
Melbourne dwelling values, on average, rose 0.5 per cent last month to take third place.  The median price in Australia's second largest city is about $718,000.
Sydney prices fell by 0.7 per cent in November, and by 1.3 per cent over the last quarter — September to November.
But buyers should not get too ahead of themselves as Sydney is still the most expensive property market by far, with a median price of about $904,000.
The only other capital city which saw its property prices drop was Darwin (-0.4pc in November, and -5.5pc in the last year).
"Darwin's property market peaked in 2014, and has fallen by about 21 per cent since then," CoreLogic's head of research Tim Lawless told the ABC.

Hobart was the best performing housing market by far — with prices up by 3.3 per cent in the last three months, and 11.5 per cent over the last year.
When asked why, Mr Lawless said it was "sheer affordability of housing" which drove the Tasmanian capital's gains.
The typical price of a house in Hobart is about $420,000, versus over $1 million in Sydney.
But when apartments are factored in, the median dwelling values in Hobart and Sydney are $398,000 and $904,000 respectively.
"Buying power is much more substantial in Hobart, especially if you're cashing out of Melbourne and Sydney," he said.
"People's money goes a lot further in Hobart, and there's a renewed trend towards buying into lifestyle markets.
"Also, the rental market is strong, with yields here much higher compared to other capital cities — which attracts more investment."
Canberra's housing values gained 10.6 per cent over the last year (beating the national average of 9.2 per cent).
Its property prices also lifted by 0.9 per cent in November (the highest of any capital city), and 1.3 per cent in the last three months.
As for the reasons behind Canberra's gains, Mr Lawless said it was due to "reasonably strong jobs growth" and public sector wages growth outperforming the private sector (since the nation's capital has a high concentration of public service roles).
When it comes to housing prices, Melbourne has beaten Sydney.
Melbourne prices lifted by 1.9 per cent over the last quarter, and by 10.1 per cent in the last year.
In comparison, Sydney prices property prices fell by 1.3 per cent in the last quarter.  But on a yearly basis, Sydney prices increased by 5 per cent — which was just half of Melbourne's annual gain.
"Tightening lending conditions" are also behind Sydney's downturn, as it is feeling much sharper and "more immediate" effects compared to other cities, Mr Lawless said.
He attributed that to the higher concentration of investor housing purchases in the nation's largest city.
On the other hand, Mr Lawless said Melbourne was "very resilient to a slowdown, as it has less problematic housing affordability compared to Sydney".
The median price of a dwelling in Melbourne was about $718,000 — which is almost $200,000 cheaper compared to Sydney's median price.
He also said Melbourne had "high rates of population growth, from interstate and overseas, a stronger labour market, and higher levels of job creation".

It also appears the Perth market has begun to recover, as housing prices lifted by 0.3 per cent in the last three months.
"If this is indeed the start of a recovery phase in the Perth housing market, it comes after dwelling values have fallen 10.8 per cent since peaking in mid-2014," he said.
For Brisbane and Adelaide, they will face a "continuation of slow and steady growth".
While Brisbane property prices rose by a slight 0.1 per cent in November, Adelaide's prices remained firmly flat.
The regional property markets also performed strongly.
The strongest gains were seen in the regional markets of Newcastle and Lake Macquarie in NSW — its housing values lifted by 13 per cent in the past year.
Properties in the Gold Coast, Sunshine Coast and Byron Bay (the "lifestyle markets") were also popular — rising by more than 5 per cent each year.
Mr Lawless said that was driven by buyers who wanted to buy a second home or holiday house, wanted a sea change, or were getting ready for retirement living.

The world's biggest lithium ion battery has been launched in South Australia, with Premier Jay Weatherill declaring it an example of SA "leading the world".
Mr Weatherill travelled to the site of the battery near Jamestown in the state's north with Romain Desrousseaux, the deputy chief executive officer of French renewable energy company Neoen, which will operate the 100-megawatt Tesla battery attached to its Hornsdale windfarm.
Tesla boss Elon Musk — who travelled to South Australia twice this year to mark significant milestones for the battery — did not visit for this event.

Mr Weatherill made light of the billionaire's non-attendance, pointing out Mr Musk had delivered on his promise to deliver the battery within a 100-day deadline or deliver it free.
"The great thing about Elon is he delivers," Mr Weatherill said.
"He's very proud of the fact that they were able to meet that deadline. He's probably a little bit relieved as well. He's got fifty million bucks in his back pocket."
The Premier said the battery had sent a message that his state was open to innovation.
"This has put us at the centre of the tech universe in South Australia," he said.

While the Premier braved wet and foggy conditions to launch the battery on the first day of summer, it was actually called into operation one day early.

Unexpectedly hot conditions across South Australia and Victoria on Thursday afternoon meant power was in short supply in both states.
The battery was ordered on by the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) late in the afternoon, pumping up to 70 megawatts of power into the grid to help meet peak demand.
SA taxpayers will pay up to $50 million in subsidies to Tesla and Neoen over the next 10 years. In return, the State Government will have access to 70 per cent of the energy stored within the battery.
Mr Weatherill said it would prove a useful tool for preventing blackouts — whether they be caused by a shortage of energy, or a lack of grid stability.
"It provides stabilisation services, which is short bursts of energy for the purposes of providing frequency control," he said.
"The second thing it does is potentially provide an extra burst of energy to deal with reserve shortfalls, the sorts of things that emerged yesterday."

While the battery proved its worth on the final day of spring, some of its closest neighbours spent the first day of summer without power.

Widespread thunderstorms swept across the state overnight, with lightning strikes damaging some powerlines, including in the Jamestown area.
Northern Areas Council mayor Denis Clark said a number of nearby farmers were left blacked out.
"They were wondering if the Premier would supply some long extension cords so they could tap into the battery to get some power," he said.
Bev Lovell, who lives near the windfarm and battery site, said a number of recent blackouts had left her angry and frustrated.
"I look out our bathroom window and I look at wind turbines," she said.
"How are we meant to be able to communicate with the outside world when we can't charge our phones and we can't even run our fridges and freezers and keep our things running like normal people would?"

The Premier said no type of power generator could prevent the sorts of blackouts caused by lightning damage to power lines and other infrastructure.
"We had 250,000 lightning strikes — an extraordinary number," he said. "It's amazing we don't have more lines down and we don't have more people out of power."
But Mr Weatherill said the battery would help make SA more resilient to the sorts of outages caused by the failure of generators, or system security problems like the statewide blackout last September.
"I think there's a view that nothing would have saved us on the 28th of September, but it may save us from less drastic events," he said.
Mr Weatherill said the AEMO had adopted a more cautious approach since the statewide blackout, and had taken steps ahead of the thunderstorms to protect the system.
Mr Weatherill said he expected to quickly recoup his Government's investment in the battery by driving down power bills.
The Government intends to use its share of the battery's output to bid into the market for stability services, which it estimates costs South Australian households and businesses in the order of $50 million a year.
"We expect that eventually this battery will be able to put a big hole in that cost for South Australian consumers," Mr Weatherill said.
"So if that happens in the way in which we expect, this battery will pay for itself from the perspective of South Australians pretty quickly."

All Tip Top-owned bread delivery trucks at its western Sydney depot have been issued with defect notices after an inspection by road safety authorities.

Police and Roads and Maritime Services (RMS) officers inspected 46 trucks and issued 25 defect notices — three major, 15 minor and seven formal warnings.
All six of the vehicles owned by Tip Top were deemed defective, the others belonged to contracted owner/drivers.
"Four speed limiter downloads were taken by NSW Police," an RMS spokesperson said.
NSW Police also issued six penalty notices, including two for defective seatbelts, one for defective brakes and one for an expired driver's licence.

Tip Top has downplayed the defects, saying it worked "amicably" with RMS on the inspection.
"Two distributor vehicles presented with issues that required immediate attention including bald tyres and a seatbelt not retracting," it said in a statement.
"The balance of issues was minor, including a fading number plate and a small crack in a light."


The inspections come after 7.30 revealed major safety concerns linked to declining rates of pay for the company's delivery drivers.
At least a dozen Tip Top delivery drivers, employed as independent contractors, told 7.30 it was common practice for drivers to work for months without a day off because they could not afford to employ relief drivers to cover their runs.
The investigation revealed repeated pay cuts, rising maintenance costs and pressure to deliver more bread meant some trucks were not being regularly serviced.
Two Tip Top delivery drivers say a replacement truck with a faulty speedometer and fuel gauge had been provided by a Tip Top supervisor.
They said the defective vehicle, which belonged to another contractor, was used when other trucks were being repaired.
Tip Top has denied providing a replacement vehicle.
In a statement the company said it was conducting a comprehensive internal investigation into the matters raised by 7.30.
Tip Top said it conducts "daily roadworthiness checks" on "random" vehicles.
"Any issues identified are logged within the internal reporting system and followed up promptly," the company said.

Telstra's budget mobile and internet provider Belong has overcharged customers overnight, debiting bank accounts multiple times.

Customers have taken to the company's Facebook page to vent their frustrations.
"Not happy Belong," one customer posted.
"You've charged my account twice and have taken a portion of my rent money, that is due to be paid today as well. Please put the money back into my account so I can pay my landlord," wrote another.
"I have a 2 year old and a newborn that can't get formula or nappies for now because my account is in minus … I had $180 in my account and belong takes out 3 payments of $65 and I won't see that back usable in my account for 7-10 days."
Others are feeling the pinch close to Christmas.
"Christmas time isn't a great time financially for a lot of people and taking extra money and having to wait god knows how long for it to be returned is unacceptable," one woman posted.
Some customers have had triple payments taken out, with Belong then telling them their accounts with the company are now in credit.

Customers also expressed anger at the difficulty in getting hold of the company, saying its online chat system was not working and its phone line seemed to be down.
Many who did get through said they had been on hold for more than an hour.
"Worst customer service ever. On hold for over an hour to sort out you guys taking out my fee twice. Call sales and they answer instantly but are unable to help me. Obviously existing customers aren't important," posted one customer.
Belong has emailed customers addressing the reports.
"We are working on the issue right now and we'll refund the overpayment as soon as possible, " the email said.
In a statement Telstra said a system error had impacted its fixed broadband customers with Belong.
"We are currently contacting impacted customers and are working to refund any overpayments as quickly as possible," it said.
"We apologise for the inconvenience this has caused our customers."
It is not known how many of the company's 150,000 customers were affected.
"Having a company unexpectedly or unfairly take a direct debit from your account is a rude shock for any customer and can make a big impact," Choice spokesperson, Stefanie Menezes said.
"People could miss payments for other bills and face unnecessary financial stress in the lead up to Christmas.
"Big telco companies such as Telstra should have better systems in place to protect their customers from this kind of financial harm."

Australia is at growing risk of a home price crash because of the high number of mum and dad property investors, inflated prices, record household debt and an economy that appears to be losing momentum, a new report says.
Local hedge fund Watermark Funds Management has warned conditions in the Australian housing market are similar to countries which experienced property busts after the global financial crisis, including the United States, the United Kingdom, Spain and the Netherlands.
Watermark predicts national home prices are likely to peak in the first half of next year, with prices in Sydney, Perth and Darwin having already fallen amid a crackdown on investor loans by the banking regulator, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority.
The price falls indicated that investors were driving the housing market.

The investment firm said the most worrying part of the Australian housing market was the "extreme" level of mum and dad investors in residential property who depend on property prices rising to make a profit.
The proportion of new mortgages taken out by non-professional property investors stands at 35 per cent in Australia — about three times higher than the US, UK and Canada.
The proportion of amateur landlord mortgages in the Sydney market was 42 per cent, which was down from half of all new mortgages in 2015-16.


Aside from the clampdown on investor-lending by the banking regulator, the report said if a Labor government came to power nationally, it may curb tax breaks for property investors, like negative gearing.

"This is a concern to the extent that recent macro-prudential measures and possible future tax changes are being specifically designed to reduce investor activity in the Australian housing market," the report said.
The fear is that price falls could be exacerbated if more amateur investors sell their properties or demand for investor loans continues to decline.
Watermark said a similar situation occurred in the US before the global financial crisis when the high number of property investors in some cities created a more volatile market.
"The US experience in the '00s suggests that housing markets with high participation of leveraged speculators tend to exhibit increased volatility in both booms and busts," the report said.
These 'investor' cities had greater than 50 per cent appreciation in the housing boom and a 50 per cent larger correction when the market declined, compared to the US national average.

Author of the report, head of financials investment at Watermark, Hamish Chalmers, said there was the possibility of a sharp drop in home prices in Australia if mum and dad investors ran for the exits.
"Our research highlighted that the Australian economy is exhibiting many similar symptoms that those other economies did before they had their housing-led busts, so things are definitely slowing," he said.
"What happens next is dependent, and how bad things will be depends on the reaction from the Government and regulators.
"It depends on the reaction of the banks themselves and I think crucially, and where Australia is different, is that there is a huge army of amateur investors."

A survey by Morgan Stanley found that 40 per cent of Australian home loan borrowers intended to sell if house prices were flat or falling, with interest-only loan borrowers three times more likely to sell.

The report said extreme levels of household debt caused downturns to be deeper and more protracted than those entered when debt levels were lower.
Watermark said Australian Bureau of Statistics data over the last 40 years indicated Australian households had increased their mortgage debt each year — a situation which has seen the Reserve Bank voice concerns over the record level of household debt, which is one of the highest in the OECD.
Mr Chalmers said the unprecedented expansion of mortgage-borrowing had been driven by Australia not having a significant economic downturn in more than a quarter of a century.
Citing Macquarie Research, the report said Australian home loan borrowers could borrow more money compared to mortgage borrowers in the UK on the same income.
"We believe that British bankers can recall a recession and house price declines while Australian bankers cannot," the report said.
"We believe hindsight will reveal Australian banks have simply over-lent to households."

Former High Court Judge Kenneth Hayne has been appointed to head the royal commission into the banking sector.
Mr Hayne, who was a Justice of the High Court for more than 17 years, will bring a "wealth of experience" to the role, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said.
Mr Turnbull this week announced the Government would hold the public inquiry, after previously rubbishing calls for it from Labor, the Greens and some Coalition backbenchers.
Mr Turnbull, Attorney-General George Brandis and Treasurer Scott Morrison said Mr Hayne was the "ideal person" to conduct the public inquiry.
"He is renowned for his brilliant mind, his forensic skill, and his deep sense of justice," they said in a statement.

Mr Hayne retired from the High Court bench in 2015.
He played an important role as a senior judge, presiding over a challenge resulting from the bungled West Australian Senate election which was heard in the Court of Disputed Returns.
Mr Hayne declared the poll void and a new election had to be held.
He also took on the urgent injunction sought by lawyers for a group of 157 Tamil asylum seekers being held at sea last year. The court ultimately ruled the group had been legally detained.
The royal commission will have 12 months to complete its inquiries, with a final report expected to be delivered by February 1, 2019.

Liquidators investigating the collapse of Queensland Nickel will be able to enter Clive Palmer's company offices and seize financial documents if they are not handed over by next Wednesday.
Justice John Reeves made the order in the Federal Court in Brisbane, after businessman Clive Palmer missed a court-imposed November 30 deadline to provide the information.
Mr Palmer has also been ordered to attend the Federal Court on December 7.
Earlier, lawyers for liquidators FTI Consulting threatened to launch contempt proceedings against Mr Palmer for not providing the material, and failing to show up for a scheduled court appearance on Thursday.
The liquidators said they would not instigate contempt proceedings if Mr Palmer attended court and provided the documents.
Mr Palmer's lawyer Andrew Boe said his client was not aware he had to personally attend court.
"He will come back immediately if he's ordered to do so," Mr Boe said.
"My instructions have been that he wishes to comply, but all I can do is go back and advise him of the need to comply."
Justice Reeves said it appeared Mr Palmer had not shown "reasonable cause" for his non-attendance.
Mr Palmer is currently in Western Australia.
Queensland Nickel collapsed with debts of about $300 million leaving 800 workers at its Yabulu refinery in Townsville in north Queensland out of work.
While Mr Palmer was not a director when Queensland Nickel collapsed, liquidators claim he was secretly running the company and using its funds to bankroll other businesses and his now-defunct political party.
In October, Mr Palmer's was ordered to provide five years of financial documents showing transactions between his company Mineralogy and other mining businesses he owned, including Queensland Nickel.
The court also wanted journal entries documenting several multi-million dollar payments, including $US14.3 million from Queensland Nickel to Mr Palmer's personal account and to a resort he owned in Tahiti.
In February, Mr Palmer said he could not remember what the payment was for, but was certain it was "for a legitimate purpose".
Other transactions under scrutiny include $7.6 million from Queensland Nickel to Mr Palmer's father-in-law, and $4.5 million worth of payments to a Chinese Queensland Nickel worker.
FTI Consulting barrister John Peden said it was unreasonable that Mr Palmer and Mineralogy had been unable to provide the information, given it was likely on a computer accounting system.
"Critically we need the documents," he said.
Mr Palmer's brother-in-law George Sokolov fronted the Federal Court in Brisbane in October to make a last-minute delivery of documents on behalf of the businessman's lawyers.
Mr Sokolov, the Bulgarian-born brother of Mr Palmer's wife Anna, wheeled in three boxes of documents to the court just as the Registrar adjourned the matter because the material had not turned up.
The documents were sought ahead of a return to the witness box by Mr Palmer's personal assistant Sarah Mole, set down for that hearing.
At a hearing in late September, Ms Mole was grilled about email and text message contact she had with the businessman's elusive nephew, Clive Mensink.
Mr Mensink left Australia in June 2016 and has not returned despite court orders to do so.

A Perth residential building company has been fined $380,000 for engaging in conduct liable to mislead the public in connection with two online review websites.
The Federal Court found Aveling Homes operated and controlled two websites — Aveling Homes product reviews and First Home Owners Centre product reviews — but represented them as independent of the firm.
The court found during periods in 2016, Aveling represented each of its review websites were independent of Aveling and were affiliated with the website www.productreview.com.au, when that was not the case.
At least 133 reviews were not published, of which 45 were less than three stars, which the court found created an inaccurately favourable overall star rating for the firm's products.
Australian Competition and Consumer Commission chairman Rod Simms said the company held back bad reviews to give a more favourable impression of its services.
"Consumers are increasingly relying on online review websites to assist with their purchasing decisions," he said.
"They are entitled to expect that review sites are independent and unbiased.
"Companies publishing customer reviews online must be clear with consumers whether or not they accurately reflect the full range of consumer feedback — the good and the bad."
The Federal Court also found the overall star rating and reviews on the review websites were more favourable towards Aveling's products and services than would have been the case if all the reviews received by Aveling were published.
Aveling Homes Group Sales and Marketing Manager Sean Quartermaine was also fined $25,000.
The court found the features and appearance of the review websites that caused the contravening conduct were designed by Mr Quartermaine.
Aveling undertook to the Federal Court not to engage in similar conduct for three years and agreed to contribute to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission costs, as well as implementing a consumer law compliance program.
The company has also published a "corrective notice" ordered by the court on their website, advising customers of their misleading conduct, which contravened Australian consumer law.
Aveling Homes told the ABC they had made changes to the review website since last December, which now made it clear the site was operated by the firm.
Aveling said the website was created to publish a "selection" of customer testimonials.
"These are verified reviews completed by clients who have built with us. We acknowledge that we did not post all positive and negative reviews on this website," the company said.
"We now appreciate that some consumers were likely to have gained the wrong impression that the website was operated independently of Aveling Homes or was in some way associated with productreview.com.
"We very much regret and apologise if anyone got that wrong impression. We should not have created such an impression or omitted the positive and negative reviews.
"We welcome all feedback about our business — whether positive or negative — and we are constantly looking for new ways to improve our operations based on the content of this client feedback."
Aveling has operated in Western Australia since 2009, and say they have build more than 2,000 homes in that time.

Telstra has cut its 2017/18 earnings guidance by $600 million, and blamed this on NBN Co's temporary suspension of the national broadband network rollout.
The company estimated its pre-tax earnings would be reduced to the $10.1 billion to $10.6 billion range.
The figure was higher at $10.7 million to $11.2 million when Telstra unveiled its full-year results in August.
On Monday, NBN's chief executive Bill Morrow warned customers to expect a six to nine-month delay before they could connect to the network via its Hybrid Fibre Coaxial (HFC) cables, which are used to deliver pay TV services.
This delay has a flow-on negative impact on Telstra's earnings because its previous guidance relied on the assumption that the rollout would be in accordance with NBN's 2017 corporate plan.
"With the addition of the delays from the NBN cease sale of HFC announced earlier this week, Telstra's outlook is now outside of the guidance range and has been updated accordingly," the company said in a statement today.

As for its total income this financial year, Telstra is forecasting it will drop by $700 million to a range between $27.6 billion and $29.5 million.
Despite the immediate financial impact from the NBN delay, Telstra is expecting to receive the funds in later financial years.
"The most significant impact from a timing perspective is the proportion of one-off receipts … to Telstra from NBN being delayed into future periods," the company said.
"The revenue recognition from Telstra's commercial works contracts with NBN will also be delayed."
Telstra even expects the delay will be "modestly financial positive" to the company "over the full rollout due to the effects of a natural hedge".
The telco left its dividend unchanged at 22 cents per share.
In the meantime, NBN Co is trying to improve the speed and dropout issues associated with the HFC cables.
But Telstra's chief executive Andrew Penn said the cables were working fine until NBN made "technology changes" to them.
Mr Penn also conceded on Tuesday that Telstra cannot tell how fast a customer's NBN speed will be until after they get connected.
Telstra shares fell 0.3 per cent to $3.42 at 10.20am (AEDT).

Bitcoin has crossed over the $US11,000 mark — briefly — as it continues its whirlwind end to the year.
It's more than welcome news to investors, who are embracing the increasing value of the digital currency, but market analysts are a bit more sceptical.
Here's why some are predicting a bitcoin crash and what would happen if it does.
Bitcoin is a type of digital cryptocurrency that first emerged in 2009.

The reason why everyone keeps talking about it is because it's increased tenfold in its value since the beginning of the year, and is currently worth more than $US10,000 after its value more than doubled since the beginning of October.
"The bitcoin phenomenon is almost unprecedented," John Noonan, senior forex analyst at Thomson Noonan, said.
"I've never seen anything like it, certainly in my 44 years.

In fact, the cryptocurrency's current market capitalisation — its price multiplied by the number of coins that have been released into the system — is roughly $US214 billion, according to industry website Coinmarketcap.
To put that in perspective, that is equivalent to the combined market cap of the Commonwealth Bank (at $140 billion) and National Australia Bank (at $80 billion).
Mr Noonan told ABC News Breakfast there are a few reasons that make bitcoin an attractive bet to some investors, including the fact it does not have a central bank and that there is a limited supply of bitcoins.


One of the other factors credited with driving the prices higher has been the announcement that investors will soon be able to bet on bitcoin futures. Even the Nasdaq is reportedly looking at getting in on that.
There's also a great deal of hype going on, fuelled somewhat by the intense media coverage it's been getting lately.

Some experts and economists see the massive growth in bitcoin value over a short period of time as an indication that people are buying because of the hype.  They appear to see it as a risky investment at best, extremely volatile at worst.
It took 834 days for Bitcoin to top $US1,000, and another 1,270 days to hit $US2,000 on May 20, 2017. But in the later half of this year alone, it has already surpassed $10,000.
It's why analysts are comparing it to Tulip Mania and the dot-com crash. Bloomberg's Stephen Gandel has even estimated that based on valuation, bitcoins are four times more expensive than dot-com stocks were at the height of their bubble.
Over the past two years, the digital currency has experienced numerous crashes, usually every couple of months.
If there was a catastrophic fall in prices, there would be winners and losers.

But it is unlikely to pose a risk to the global economy like other bubbles, according to bitcoin expert Adrian Lee, a senior lecturer in finance at the University of Technology in Sydney.
That's because, for one thing, there's not as much money tied up in bitcoin as there was during the dot-com bubble, Mr Lee says, pointing out that while there is billions in bitcoin, there were trillions spent during the dot-com bubble.
"So [for example], it wouldn't effect the Australia dollar I'd say, because nobody really uses it at the moment," he said.
"If you think about it, there's trillions of trading in the Australian dollar whereas bitcoin is at most worth [approximately] $200 billion at total so it's hardly anything compared to the trillions in foreign exchange.
What also makes this unique is that it is unlikely people are borrowing to invest in bitcoin, according to RMIT professor of economics Jason Potts.
"There's very little evidence of anyone borrowing money to buy cryptocurrency and if I was a bank or a lender, there's no way I would loan out money to do that," he said.
Our experts said that seemed unlikely. It's still a relatively small number of people with money invested — roughly similar to the amount of people using email in 1994, Mr Potts said. So we're still very much in the early adoption phase.

And Mr Potts said there had not been many retail investors involved. "The sort of people who would hold superannuation funds … they're not in this market and might not be for some time," he said.
That would limit the fallout to the wider economy in a worst-case scenario. "If it crashed, it would only largely be those people who speculate on it, maybe people who use bitcoin and maybe the exchanges may lose money. But then again the exchanges don't require much overhead to run it, so if it fell they'd still be OK," Mr Lee said.
Mr Potts agreed. "It doesn't actually cause catastrophic financial meltdown. Some people who bought at the wrong time would be angry, other people who have been waiting to buy would be happy," he said.
Those who have invested in associated entities, including mining infrastructure and ICO-based businesses, would also lose out, Mr Lee said.
"The bitcoin miners would take a big hit, these guys who all they do is buy machines to mine bitcoins will lose money when the value falls," Mr Lee said.
He also said the impact on other cryptocurrencies would depend on what sparked the crash.
If it were as a result of central banks cracking down on bitcoin then you would expect the value of other cryptocurrencies to also fall. But if it was because of irrational exuberance, then only those cryptocurrencies that have experienced similarly sharp rises in their value would drop.
Mr Potts says the chances of systematic crash are extremely low.

The bitcoin expert told the ABC that the recent surge in value is not a 'bubble' but a "price discovery".
"Bubbles are things that happen to technologies or commodities or products that we know what they're for, so tulips can have a bubble because you know what they're for, or houses can have a bubble if the price of a house departs wildly from people's ability to pay … but this isn't like that," he said.
"This is a fundamental, radical new technology where every day we're discovering new uses for it and that gets priced in.
"I think what we're observing in this growth of price over the last nine years … is this gradual discovery of more and more uses for it, this gradual confidence in the technology."
Besides, Mr Potts says there's been what could be described as "crashes" in bitcoin every few months. On Wednesday alone, bitcoin rose as much as 15 per cent, but by mid-afternoon (US time) was trading at $US9,500 at one point because of a crash that lasted roughly six hours.
"There's been some big crashes, crashes of up to 80 per cent [of its value] and it's recovered," he said. "What's impressive is that they happen and then it bounces back."
"There's an enormous amount of volatility, but there's also a long-term growth trend in bitcoin in particular. It has grown [apart from 2014] every other year so over in the long-term it's been a solidly performing asset," he said.
"It's just scary to hold."

Australian stocks are headed for a strong start today, amid a record-breaking session on Wall Street.

The Dow Jones surged by 331 points, past the 24,000 mark for the first time.
It seems the market is getting increasingly confident US President Donald Trump's corporate tax cuts may finally get passed.
What changed was that Republican Senator John McCain announced he would vote in favour of the tax bill currently before the US Senate.
"I believe this legislation, though far from perfect, would enhance American competitiveness, boost the economy, and provide long overdue tax relief for middle class families," Senator McCain said in a statement.
The senator's support is seen as crucial as the Republicans have a slim Senate majority.
He also previously broke ranks and voted against the repeal of Obamacare.
With the prospect of lower corporate taxes, the financial sector lifted by 0.6 per cent.
But the energy sector was the strongest performer, rising 1.5 per cent over the latest developments in oil markets.
Brent crude prices lifted after the world's largest producers, Russia and the OPEC nations (Saudia Arabia, Iran, Iraq and others), made a deal to continue curbing oil output after hours of discussions at a summit in Vienna.
They agreed to cut production by 1.8 million barrels a day until the end of 2018, in an effort to boost oil prices and clear a global glut of crude.
With SPI futures rising by 0.4 per cent, the local share market is expected to open higher.
The Australian dollar has fallen slightly against the greenback, and is buying 75.65 US cents.
It has also weakened against the British pound (-0.9pc) and euro (-0.6pc).
However, it has risen against the Japanese yen (+0.5pc) and New Zealand dollar (+0.8pc).

A hotly contested deal between Adani and traditional owners of its proposed Carmichael mine site in Queensland's Galilee Basin would deliver compensation "well below" what most big miners pay, according to a new analysis.
The Wangan and Jagalingou (W&J) people would only get 0.2 per cent of Adani's earnings from the mine, less than half the industry average, respected mining industry outfit Economics Consulting Services has found.
Its report, obtained by the ABC, was commissioned by six W&J representatives whose looming court challenge to the deal stands as the final legal hurdle to Adani's contentious mega-mine.
It found the W&J people would earn up to $145 million over 30 years, out of the project's estimated $77.4 billion in gross revenue, a share which was "well below industry benchmark standards".
The benchmarks for such deals usually ranged from 0.75 per cent to 0.35 per cent.

Only 11 per cent of the deal would come to the W&J people in cash, up to $17.4 million over 30 years, or about $2,300 a year per adult member of the clan.
Report author Murray Meaton, who was awarded an Order of Australia in 2014 for services to the mining industry, found the benefits to the W&J people would be "dramatically lower" if job promises for locals fell short as they did "in most jurisdictions and agreements".
To gain finance for the $21 billion project, Adani needs an Indigenous Land Use Agreement (ILUA) with the W&J people, or it must call on the Queensland Government to forcibly extinguish any native title claim over the mine site in the Galilee Basin.
After almost six years of vexed negotiations with Adani, the W&J representative group is evenly split over the deal.
The Indigenous group twice rejected Adani in 2012 and 2014 before seven of 12 W&J representatives swung their support behind the miner last year.

But Adani lost majority support in June when one representative changed heart, sending the group into deadlock after the ILUA was allegedly authorised in a meeting funded by Adani.
The Adani supporters in the W&J have argued the mine is inevitable and they need to seize the miner's offer to economically benefit their people, including some who live in Queensland's more disadvantaged communities.
However, the anti-Adani group object to the destruction of their ancestral lands and culture, and contest the legitimacy of the meeting that approved the Adani deal.
The dispute will go to trial in the federal court in Brisbane in March.
The case has pushed back Adani's deadline on clinching finance for the project, which remains in doubt.
The report from Economics Consulting Services, which has handled more than 150 native title negotiations involving major Australian miners, found the mine's first phase "appears to be a very profitable project" but it was unlikely to last beyond 30 years.
Mr Meaton was concerned that 75 per cent of Adani's offer hinged on job promises for the W&J people, mostly an "optimistic" pledge of up to 50 jobs earning an average of $75,000 a year over 30 years.
"This is not a well-balanced package," his report said.
The estimated value of business contracts was potentially another $725,000 a year, mostly via a bus service for mine workers and cultural heritage and environmental works that would offer 50 casual jobs.
Mr Meaton found that while the total value of the deal to W&J people was "heavily dependent" on jobs and contracts, "jobs and contract targets have not been delivered in most jurisdictions and agreements".
An Adani spokesman could not be reached for comment on Thursday.

At a time when public funds are being spent laying new tramlines in Adelaide's CBD, many a frustrated commuter has no doubt wondered why our city's once extensive tram network was scrapped in the first place.
One Curious Adelaidean asked us to track down the answer (pun intended).
"Why was Adelaide's tram network ripped up in the 1950s?"
The answer? It's complicated.
But a run-down system, poor financial management, and a perhaps misguided view about the future of our city all played a role.
Adelaide's first tram network was highly profitable and an engineering feat to be proud of.
In 1909, horse-drawn trams gave way to electric and a fortune was spent creating an impressive network across the greater metropolitan area.

But the enviable web of public transport options didn't last long.
The Municipal Tramways Trust (MTT) introduced a 10-year plan to phase out trams in favour of buses by the mid 50s.
The public's affection for the network and dismay at its loss is evident in letters to the editor from the time.
"The MTT is making a big mistake in scrapping the trams," wrote A.J. Lines of Hyde Park to The Advertiser in 1954.
"As a quick, efficient means of transport, there is nothing to equal the trams.
"It would be a thousand pities to have them taken from us."
C. Steele of Tusmore seemed to have a window to the future.
"A tram which carries 100 people has 50 times more right to be on the road than a car which carries only two people."
Ultimately, the campaign to save the trams was in vain and in 1958 the closure of the Cheltenham tram service left the Glenelg tramway as the sole remaining track.
The Department of Planning Transport and Infrastructure told Curious Adelaide that after its initial glory days, the tram network simply became unviable.
"The emergence of trolley buses combined with rapid growth in private car ownership led to a decline in tram usage," the department said.
"Postponed maintenance of track infrastructure because of the Second World War, and the following shortage of materials resulted in the tracks being worn."

But a scathing 1955 report by the Council of the South Australian Branch of Australian Electric Traction Association suggested some deeper issues.
The report referred to "staggering losses" by the MTT brought about by "mismanagement" and "indeterminate and constant indecision".
The council was clearly in opposition to the decision to scrap the network, declaring the abandonment of the electric tramcar system "not only uneconomical in the long run, but completely undesirable".
Archivist Colin Seymour, who works for the Tramway Museum in St Kilda in Adelaide's north, believed there were many factors at play.

"I guess they took the easy way out at the time because the system was run down after the Second World War," he said.
But Mr Seymour believed other approaches were preferable.
"They should've perhaps got rid of the less profitable lines and kept some of the main lines that were pretty busy," he said.
"[The could have] gradually updated them over a period of time like they did in Melbourne."

Further investigation of newspaper reports from the time reveal the MTT had racked up a deficit of £1.12 million, with yearly losses in the hundreds of thousands of pounds.
Such were the state of its finances, the state government provided an aid payment of £700,000.
As with most significant historical events, there's always room for a good conspiracy theory.
Our Curious Adelaide questioner alerted us to one such theory.
There were whisperings at the time that tram networks were dismantled globally because oil companies were manipulating the fuel price market to make buses more desirable and cost effective.
Tramway Museum manager Jack Pennack said an emerging local car industry and the increasing power of oil companies certainly played a part, but not as part of a broader conspiracy.
"GMH was wanting to set up car production in South Australia, the flow was towards the motor industry and the only place that really stood against it was Melbourne," Mr Pennack said.
"The oil companies were getting a stranglehold on things, so in the end [premier Tom] Playford went along with diesel railcars."
The old trams that used to service our sprawling city network, long since retired, can now be seen at the tramway museum.
Mr Pennack remembers the ceremonious final tram ride on the Cheltenham line in 1958.

"It was totally packed that night," he recalled.
"I was about 13 at the time and very much a junior recruit for the cause."
Mr Pennack said as a lad he knew the infrastructure wasn't up to scratch.
"They were badly rundown, at the time I thought it was great fun but I wasn't seeing it in the way those who ran Adelaide had to see it, the system needed massive rehabilitation," Mr Pennack said.
He now believes the decision to scrap the tram network was "understandable, but regrettable".
"I think today it should be exactly the same as it was in '56, same trams, same lines," he laughed.
"We know that's not possible, that's only a dream."
The South Australian Government is spending more than $80 million on the first stage of its tram network extension project.
It will provide additional tram stops along North Terrace to East Terrace and up King William Road to the Adelaide Festival Plaza precinct.
There are also multi-billion-dollar plans for other tramlines, branching out through Adelaide's suburbs including Norwood, Henley Beach, Adelaide Airport, North Adelaide, Prospect and Mitcham.

Tasmania's three salmon producers are set to meet with the Environment Protection Authority (EPA) to discuss contingency planning for a mass mortality event in Macquarie Harbour.
The Director of the EPA Wes Ford said he was confident the industry could handle a reasonable sized event but more planning was required for a bigger fish kill.
In January last year Mr Ford wrote to companies saying the likelihood of a fish kill in Macquarie Harbour was "sufficiently high that any company involved in farming in the harbour should assume that such an event will occur at some time and should plan and prepare accordingly."
It also warned that a failure to plan could result in a "situation causing serious environmental harm and considerable damage to the reputation of the industry".
The letter was sent before the EPA took over the regulation of the industry.
Mr Ford said the Tasmanian Salmonid Growers Association (TGSA) has organised the upcoming meeting.
"What the companies need to work through is basically being able to get the dead fish out of the water relatively quickly and then we're also interested in the disposal process, so we're working with them on a range of disposal options."
Mr Ford said the EPA has met with the TGSA and salmon companies on a number of occasions in the last year to discuss mortalities, but a joint meeting would be advantageous.

"We can have a discussion about shared resources, see what's available and also each of the companies can understand what the contingency plans of the other companies are," he said.
Frances Bender from Huon Aquaculture said she is "heartened" to see all three companies and the EPA coming together.
"I'm happy to see that we're actually having a meeting where all people involved are in the same room at the same time, rather than entities having meetings and then writing and going backwards and forwards and losing time," she said.
In response to the EPA's 2016 letter Huon Aquaculture warned it could take weeks to remove morts (dead fish) if a mass mortality event occurred.
"Obviously this would not be practical with morts becoming impossible to handle without disintegrating within only a few days at warm water and air temperatures," the company said.
It's thought the industry is capable of removing around 300 tonnes of fish a day, the current amount of salmon allowed in the harbour in 12,000 tonne.

Mr Ford said a mortality event involving several hundred tonne of salmon at a Petuna lease in 2015 showed the industry had the capacity to handle similar sized events.
"There is sufficient planning in place for a reasonably sized event and the companies are continuing to look at what their options are."
Mr Ford said a bigger event wasn't expected but the upcoming meeting would work through what capability there would be to remove additional morts.
"That's what we need to work through with the companies, what is their capacity?," he said.
"That's always the challenge in any contingency planning whether it be fire, flood earthquake, animal disease or fish mortality."
A recent outbreak of the naturally-occurring pilchard orthomyxovirus has killed around 50,000 juvenile salmon in the harbour.
The EPA has also said the dissolved oxygen levels in the mid-water of the harbour are lower now than what they were this time last year.
"I think (the meeting) is now being treated with a lot more urgency than it was being treated before," Ms Bender said.
"I think that's an understanding that we need to work together all departments and all businesses to develop a wholistic overview of how we're going to manage in the unfortunate event that something like (a mass mortality event) happens."
Ms Bender said the recent hot weather was also a concern.
"We don't know how the summer is going to pan out but it's one hell of a shock that we've had it so hot so early."
Hot weather increases the risk of fish deaths and Ms Bender said already low dissolved oxygen levels in Macquarie Harbour meant the industry had to be "doubly careful".
"Making sure that we have low stocking densities, making sure that we have pristine clean nets so that we have the oxygen flow flowing through to the fish," she said.
"That we're looking after the environment as best we can."
In a statement, Tassal agreed the industry needed to work together.
"We believe the meeting between all three parties is important as we are all facing the same issues, and a wholistic plan jointly agreed upon will be instrumental to proactively manage the health of the Harbour."
No-one from Petuna was available to respond to the ABC's request for comment.

The New South Wales Government will pay off the HECs debts of 60 graduates each year if they sign up for a posting at one of 150 eligible rural and remote schools around the state.
The move is part of a revamped $140 million package aimed at boosting education standards in country schools.
There are currently more than 200 staff vacancies at rural schools.
The scholarships, which will be available from 2018 to HSC or university students looking to study teaching, will also include a $7,500 annual stipend to assist student teachers with their studies and a $6,000 sign-on bonus when they start their new job.
Making the announcement at Finley Public School, about 150 kilometres west of Albury, Education Minister Rob Stokes said it meant young teachers would be able get years ahead financially by moving to a country school.
"These incentives really make it a no-brainer," Mr Stokes said.
"If I was a young teacher starting out, I reckon this is an incredible opportunity."
Mr Stokes said there were also changes to the incentives offered to attract and retain more experienced teachers to eligible remote and regional schools, including:

"We want to attract the brightest young minds, but it is also important that they are supported by experienced mentors who will ensure the best educational outcomes are achieved for their students," Mr Stokes said.
Mr Stokes acknowledged previous incentive schemes had failed to prevent teacher shortages in the bush, and conceded the new measures were not a magic bullet.
"It's always been a struggle and I anticipate that it will continue to be so," Mr Stokes said.
Finley High School principal Helen McCrae said recruiting and retaining good staff was one of the most challenging aspects of her job.
"It can be a huge issue," she said.
"I have sometimes had to advertise four times to fill positions."

One teacher who has made the move from Newcastle to Finley in January is Nicholas Campbell.
He said moving to the country was good for his career and for his young family.
"There's more time to spend with the family because the commute to work is a 100-metre walk," he said.
An independent review commissioned by the Federal Government will deliver its report on how to attract and retain teachers at regional, remote and rural schools by the end of the year.

A federal court judge has slammed Volkswagen for failing to explain why they fitted cars with emissions "defeat devices", and has warned company executives may be forced to take the stand over the matter.

The Volkswagen Group is currently the subject of court proceedings brought about by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) and two law firms representing the owners of nearly 100,000 affected Volkswagen, Audi and Skoda vehicles in Australia.
The emissions scandal erupted in 2015 when the US Environmental Protection Agency discovered many Volkswagen cars sold in America were fitted with software designed to evade government pollution controls.
In September, Judge Lindsay Foster ordered Volkswagen to explain under oath why the software was developed and installed in the first place.
At a hearing in the Sydney Federal Court on Thursday, Judge Foster said the company had not answered the question that went to the "heart of the case".
"There is a reason why this was done that your client has to answer," Judge Foster said.
"If there is some legitimate engineering reason, let's hear it."
Volkswagen's barrister, Ruth Higgins SC, said they did not know why the software was installed because they were not involved.
The judge was not satisfied with the answer.
"Why was this done? How difficult can this be? Why was it done in the first place? Why at all?" he demanded.

Judge Foster has given Volkswagen two more weeks to answer the question, ahead of next year's class action.
"Plenty of people did know about this," said Judge Foster, pointing out that senior people had to have directed the research and installation of the software.
"That is being denied," Dr Higgins responded. She argued they had answered the Judge's question.
Judge Foster had also asked Volkswagen, Audi and Skoda whether the software installed in Australia, Europe and the US was all the same.
While lawyers for the Volkswagen Group responded, the court heard Skoda and Audi had failed to comply with a court order and had not answered the question.
"They simply cannot do this. It's not the first time and it displays an attitude of some arrogance," Judge Foster said.
Judge Foster said the respondents appeared "to please themselves with which point they'll come back with".
The Australian class action will begin in March.

Bali, Singapore and Thailand are more attractive tourist destination than regional WA thanks to unreasonably high airfares that are adversely affecting the lives of people who live in outback areas, a parliamentary committee has found.
The inquiry, which generated more submissions than any other Legislative Assembly probe, examined why regional airfares are so high and what the airlines and WA Government could do about it.
Committee chair Jessica Shaw told Parliament high airfares were often a major reason people moved away from regional areas.
"People recounted stories where they had been unable to attend important legal or personal appointments, visit sick relatives, attend significant family events, or — tragically — say final farewells to loved ones," she said.
"People told us that their Perth-based families could not afford to visit them (and vice versa), that they could not visit their children at boarding school or regularly bring them home, that their adult children could not return home from university, that they cannot themselves afford to go away on holiday.
"All of these factors can compound feelings of isolation and loneliness."
The report found the high cost of airfares had a significant effect on local businesses, including on recruitment and training costs, staff attraction and retention, professional development and business development.

"The Committee received considerable evidence suggesting that fares on unregulated routes are unreasonably priced," Ms Shaw said.
Tourism also suffered, as people were much more likely to choose cheap flights to South East Asia than regional WA for holidays.
"Return flights to such overseas locations from regional towns can be considerably cheaper than a return flight inside the state," the report found.
Airlines were reluctant to provide detailed pricing information to the committee, hindering its inquiry, though it received many submissions claiming price-gouging, particularly for fares booked close to the date of departure.
"While the airlines operating on unregulated routes stated to the committee that their regional fares are now lower than before the peak of the mining boom, direct proof of these assertions was not provided," the report found.
"Qantas, in particular, refused during its hearing to provide the committee with information on its pricing, claiming 'commercial confidentiality', despite the committee's offer to receive the information on a confidential basis."
Many submissions to the committee told of the distress caused by the high cost of last-minute flights to respond to family emergencies.
"If people have to travel to Perth with little notice for an emergency (such as a family funeral), the high cost of the airfare adds enormous emotional pressure and stress to their already difficult situation," one submission said.
Another said the "airlines pray on the BBS—the business, the bereaved and the sick, those who have got to fly on short notice".
The committee found the passenger cost per kilometre for WA routes were up to 80 per cent higher that interstate routes elsewhere in Australia, a difference Qantas said was due to reduced passenger numbers in WA.
Kununurra resident Joanne Pavlinovich's submission said the prohibitive cost of airfares made her less inclined to travel anywhere not within driving distance.
"I found myself isolated from Perth friends and family, unable to attend special events including birthdays and weddings," she wrote.
"The Kimberley is losing so many high-quality professional, community members and volunteers because it simply costs so much to live in the region."
The report found the size of the state made air transport a necessity for most living outside Perth.
"For regional communities, with little opportunity for alternative travel modes to distant destinations such as Perth, their aviation services are seen as an essential public transport, akin to the access Perth residents have to buses and trains,"' it found.
It recommended an immediate review of the state's aviation strategy, including an examination of whether more routes should be subsidised and regulated, particularly the Kununurra to Perth route, where return airfares often cost more than $1,000.
Currently, seven routes are regulated and have a single operator, including Albany, Esperance, Kalbarri, Exmouth and Carnarvon.
It found airfares often changed by the day and hour, but those on regulated routes were less subject to volatility.
The report also suggested the possibility of a government-run online regional airfare comparison tool, similar to FuelWatch, to help passengers find the cheapest fares.
However, City of Kalgoorlie-Boulder CEO John Walker said re-regulating flight routes was not a long-term solution, despite the committee reporting relatively high satisfaction in regulated communities such as Albany and Esperance.
"I'm not a supporter of regulation, and I don't think the people, generally, would be," Mr Walker said.
"It's easy for us to say, in Kalgoorlie, we should regulate the fares so its cheaper to get to Perth, but then what happens when you want to go beyond there?
"We have deregulation to go overseas, for example, and there's a lot of consumer benefit."
But Mr Walker said more oversight was necessary, arguing the Government should focus on forcing pricing transparency from the major airlines.
Lifelong Broome resident Jacqueline Dixon has to fly to Perth several times a year to get medical treatment for her grandson, who she looks after, but cannot afford airfares that are not subsidised through the Patient Assistance Travel Scheme.
"We'd love down to go down there (to Perth) but the cost of the flights [is too much]," she said.
"(I feel) sad, they need to put those airfares down so we can go down for holidays or funerals … some families can't make it because of the prices."
Broome's Runway Bar manager Tex Kitchen said customers often complained about the cost of flights, and the local economy would be boosted significantly by cheaper fares.
"If the airports can't drop the prices themselves, government departments have got to speak," he said.
"If they can't justify why they should charge those prices, then the Government should have a subsidy."

Almost 1 million jobs will be created in Australia over the next five years but there won't be enough skilled workers to fill them.
That's according to Business Council chief executive Jennifer Westacott, who says Australia faces a crippling skills shortage unless more funding is urgently returned to vocational education.
The Federal Department of Employment predicts almost half of those jobs created will require a vocational qualification.
The rapidly ageing population, construction of major infrastructure, a growing taste for eating out and the full rollout of the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) will drive many of the new jobs.
There are serious concerns funding cuts to the vocational education and training (VET) system have left it in no shape to meet that challenge.
Ms Westacott fears, "we will have to spend billions to put it back together".
"We'll have another skills shortage then we'll have another debate about bringing in foreign workers, or we will just lose new businesses and new activities to other countries where they have a more trained and skilled workforce," Ms Westacott told 7.30.

"This is urgent. Go and look at other countries, go and look at Germany, go and talk to any senior business person in the United States, particularly the people in the big technology companies, and they'll say to you it's the vocational system we should be focusing on now."
Professor Peter Noonan, an expert in tertiary education policy from the Mitchell Institute at Victoria University, told 7.30 he was deeply worried.
"Between 2014 and 2015, state governments took $1 billion out of vocational education and training," he said.
"The Commonwealth has more or less maintained what it puts in but the states have really dropped the ball."
He said one of the biggest disadvantages faced by VET students was not having access to the generous university loan scheme.
"Enrolments are going down but the most regrettable thing is that fees for students are going up, and in some cases students are paying thousands of dollars up front and they can't get an income contingent loan like they can if they're going to university," he said.

Disability service provider Yellowbridge is already unable to find enough qualified staff.
The company, based in Toowoomba in regional Queensland, would like to hire another 50 people but CEO Penny Hamilton said they weren't available.
"I don't know if it's a crisis but I think it is something that needs to be looked at pretty quickly," she said.
"With the rollout of the NDIS we've had an increase in services that are required, but there really isn't the workforce out there to actually do the support work that we require."
Yellowbridge has paid for staff, including disability support worker Kevin McLennan, to complete a certificate III in individual care with a private provider.
He said not having to pay the fee was a relief.
"It was a big concern for me, especially coming into the job. I was unemployed for a little bit so it's hard to just fork out that type of money for a certificate," he said.

While TAFE offers early childhood courses, many students choose to study it at university to avoid fees.
Education consultant Jonathan Chew said it was an easy decision for many students to make.
"You might be looking at an out-of-pocket fee of anywhere from $1,000 to $4,000, [to study early childhood in VET]," he said.
"If you study that at a university you'd be paying nothing for a bachelor-equivalent degree."
The Business Council is calling for a dramatic shakeup that would put vocational education into a single tertiary system.
Ms Westacott wants each student to be given a lifelong skills account, with the same subsidies and loans to spend wherever they choose.
"What that would allow you to do is basically assemble a qualification," she said.
"What I mean by that is, as people will need a module of something they don't need to go into a whole undergraduate or postgraduate degree.
"They can go and get that from a vocational provider — a TAFE or a private provider. They can get that from the university and they can effectively assemble their own qualification."

South Australia's giant Tesla battery has begun dispatching stored wind power into the electricity grid a day ahead of its scheduled switch-on.
Premier Jay Weatherill is visiting the battery site — alongside the Hornsdale windfarm near Jamestown in the state's mid north — on Friday, to mark its official opening on the first day of summer.
But with temperatures across South Australia and Victoria hitting the mid 30s, and output from the state's wind farms low, the battery was called upon early to help meet Thursday afternoon's peak demand.
The battery dispatched a maximum of 59 megawatts of power.
The 100MW/129MWh battery is capable of powering about 30,000 homes for a little over an hour.
The manufacturer, Tesla says the lithium-ion device — made up of PowerWall 2 batteries —  is both the "largest" by storage and "most powerful" of its type in the world.
South Australian taxpayers will be subsidising its operation with up to $50 million over the next 10 years.
In return, the South Australian Government will have the right to use the battery to prevent load-shedding blackouts.
It will also be able to use a portion of the battery's output to provide system security services to the grid, in an effort to bring down prices.
The hot weather on the eve of summer prompted the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) into taking the highly unusual step of paying power customers to reduce their electricity usage during the peak period.
The customer or customers involved have not been identified.
But they are likely to be heavy power users who volunteered to be directed to reduce their power usage under a "demand management" program.
That program is a key part of AEMO's plan to prevent unexpected blackouts this summer.
The plan was enacted after the closure of the Hazelwood coal-fired power station in Victoria.
It provides the market operator with about 1,000 megawatts of demand management and emergency generation to use to help balance supply and demand in the grid.

Jeff Morris is the whistleblower who can take much of the credit for today's announcement of a royal commission into the banking industry.
It was his actions in exposing corrupt practices at the Commonwealth Bank that led first to a parliamentary inquiry and now finally to the royal commission.
But Mr Morris has paid an enormous personal price for his actions, including threats against his life and effectively losing his job.
"It had a horrific impact on my family. My wife was never in favour of me doing what I did and it's hard to argue with her, really, when you look back at what happened," he said.
"I guess part of what I've learned is the determination that nobody should have to go through what I've gone through as a whistleblower ever again."

In 2008, Mr Morris began work as a financial planner at the CBA in Sydney. Very soon he found evidence of corruption going "all the way to the top".
"Corruption was absolutely rife. There were crooked plans stitching up literally widows and orphans, and there was a crooked management team covering it up," he told the ABC.
In one case, two retirees had seen a CBA financial planner, but half a million dollars of their retirement portfolio had been "vaporised".

"They couldn't get any straight answers out of the planner. They couldn't get any straight answers out of his manager at the CBA. And the people who were meant to deal with this complaint were trying to fob them off," Mr Morris said.
"That was when I realised the bank was going to do this to all these people. And as individuals they wouldn't stand a chance, unless someone on the inside did something about the cover-up that was going on."
Mr Morris was one of three 'ferrets' who blew the whistle on a rogue financial planner at the bank.
They sent a fax to the financial regulator, ASIC, with a series of accusations. But he says ASIC was "useless", and did nothing for years.
Eventually he felt he had no choice but to leave the bank and go public with the allegations, first in the media and eventually before a parliamentary inquiry.
He told the inquiry he had learned of a threat to shoot him.
He says alongside the royal commission, the Government must strengthen legislative protection for whistleblowers.

"I'm concerned that when the Government says they're going to tackle whistleblower reform, they'll put some legislation in place but it won't be the real deal. It won't be as tough as it should be," he said.
"I've had a lot of people come to me for advice. I've told them what to expect and they say, 'Well I've got a family, I can't do that'."
From the beginning, Mr Morris has called for a royal commission. He says despite longstanding opposition from within government, there is a groundswell for reform.
"It's a good feeling. It's taken far too long of course, but I've always been confident that we'd get here," he said.

The well-known Australian handbag and accessories retailer Oroton has gone into voluntary administration.

In a statement to the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX), Oroton said its 62 stores in Australia, New Zealand and Malaysia would continue to trade as normal, while administrator, Deloitte Restructuring Services, tried to find a buyer.
A spokesperson for Oroton told the ABC no jobs at the company were in jeopardy at this stage, and shoppers could continue to use gift vouchers at Oroton stores.
Oroton launched a strategic review of the business in May, but today's statement confirmed it had not been able to find a viable solution which could achieve a better outcome than voluntary administration.
The retailer issued a series of earnings downgrades earlier this year and reported a loss of $14.2 million for the 2016-2017 financial year.
"Our focus is on continuing to operate the business as we seek a recapitalisation or sale of this iconic brand," administrator Vaughn Strawbridge said.
"The flexibility of the voluntary administration process enhances the ability to further restructure OrotonGroup in a manner which makes it possible to achieve the best possible outcome in these circumstances.
"Our ambition is that a stronger Oroton business will emerge from this process."
Oroton's interim chief executive Ross Lane said every effort was made to avoid voluntary administration.
"The board is disappointed that it has to take this step after running such a comprehensive process," he said.
Deloitte Restructuring Services advised that Oroton's annual general meeting, which was planned for tomorrow, would not proceed as scheduled, but would be deferred to a date to be advised.
The first meeting of creditors will take place on December 11.
Oroton is the latest fashion retailer in Australia to collapse, joining Pumpkin Patch, Payless Shoes, Marcs, David Lawrence, Herringbone and Rhodes & Beckett, which have all gone under in the past 18 months.

A failure to convince interstate and overseas tourists to visit Western Australia — which is perceived as "too far away, too expensive and with a scarcity of hotel rooms" — is set to cost the State $800 million in projected tourism revenue by the end of the decade.
That's the key finding of a report by the auditor-general on the State Government's key "Strategy for Tourism in WA 2020" policy.
The strategy — launched by Tourism WA five years ago — aims to double tourism spending to $12 billion by 2020.
Under the plan, by 2017 WA was supposed to be enjoying a sustained boost to leisure and business tourist numbers.

But auditor-general Colin Murphy found that was yet to happen, making it "unlikely the strategy goal will be met in 2020".
Specifically, the auditor-general found there was a lack of growth in spending, especially among international visitors; inadequate marketing, despite a $42 million budget; and a failure to deliver four to five new "hallmark" events.
Mr Murphy said without "rapid and significant improvement", the key target of $12 billion in tourism spending by 2020 would be missed — by at least $800 million according to some projections.
He said despite a "good plan", Tourism WA had been inconsistent in following it, meaning targets for visitor numbers had been missed.
Part of the problem, Mr Murphy said, was a lack of collaboration and engagement between the government-funded agency and other tourism partners.
Tourism WA also needed to be more nimble in picking up on failures quickly and redirecting funding to where it would have the greatest impact, Mr Murphy said.

Responding to the report, the Department of Jobs, Science, Tourism and Innovation (JSTI) said efforts to lure holiday makers away from international markets had paid off last financial year, but acknowledged there was still work to be done.
Correcting the lingering perceptions on the east coast that WA is too far away, too expensive and has a scarcity of hotel rooms, remains a challenge," the department said.
It pointed out 3,300 hotel rooms had been built or were due for completion next year and would help make Perth more attractive as a leisure destination.
"The new hotel rooms also make Perth a better value proposition following years of a lack of accommodation and high hotel room costs due to high business demand fuelled by the mining sector," it said.

Tourism WA board member Elizabeth Gaines said the agency's goal to double tourism spending by 2020 was an ambitious one.
"I think the fact that the agency is on track to deliver over $11 billion in value means it's actually got pretty close to that stretch target," Ms Gaines said.
"Undoubtedly there are clear learnings and we should take those on board, but I do think that what has been delivered for Western Australia was an ambitious target and we've done very well."
The auditor-general said there was still time to achieve the target, but it would be challenging given a lack of progress to date and the economic downturn.
Tourism Council head Evan Hall said the State could not afford the $800 million shortfall and needed to rethink the way it promotes itself.
"The CEO of Tourism Western Australia is also the director general of a department, he can't be expected to be a tourism expert," Mr Hall said.
"The head of tourism marketing — we've had seven different people in seven years do that job. We keep doing the same thing, putting a generalist into the role.
"What we need is an expert who is going to lead that marketing, make the best use of the Government's investment in marketing and make sure we turn that into bums in beds."
Mr Murphy made six key recommendations for Tourism WA, with half to be introduced by mid-2018.
They include improvements in planning, record-keeping and engagement with partners, as well as better prioritisation of activities.
The report said Tourism WA should also consider reviewing its business model by 2020.

Workers at the Edith Creek milk plant have expressed a mix of devastation and cautious optimism as the north-west Tasmanian plant shuts down.
The plant was bought by Thai company Dutch Mill in an 11th hour announcement yesterday after current owners Murray Goulburn completed a lengthy sale process.
But the factory will still close in the short term, with the loss of around 120 jobs.
The new owners hope to reopen the facility in the second quarter of 2018.
Kathy Wallis, an end line operator, has been working at the factory for two decades.

"It's just sad, really sad. There are so many feelings running through our minds right now … we're angry that it has come to this."
"But we're also happy and relieved that it's been bought by another company."
Mrs Wallis will be working a casual job as a cleaner over the Christmas period to help make ends meet.
"We just want to know what that means for the workers who lose a job today.
"We thought this was safe, it was a good factory, this just goes to show it can happen to anybody."
For Craig Harvey from the National Union of Workers (NUW), the fight is not yet over.
"The next question is, how will Dutch Mill treat its workers, will they offer similar conditions?" Mr Harvey asked.

"Were optimistic, they will have a hard time attracting experienced local labour if they go down the path of low pay and bad conditions.
"We're looking forward to working with them for good outcomes for everyone. At the end of the day it's great news there is a buyer."
The NUW yesterday sent a letter requesting consultations with Dutch Mill. The company is yet to respond, the union said.
As the factory workers waved to each other as they left today, a worker in a silver sedan beeped and waved as she left the factory for the last time.
Mrs Wallis left through the yellow gates after 20 years.
"It's bittersweet but we're already looking to the future — you have to be optimistic," she said.
"I think I'm used to the idea now."
New owner Dutch Mill was founded in Thailand in the early 1980s.
It has a large presence in the south-east Asian market and recently expanded into Myanmar.
In an interview with the ABC yesterday, Dutch Mill Australia's spokesman, Anthony Guinness, said the company wanted to turn the site into a "world-class" facility.

"What is important to us is engaging with the community … about employment and that's obviously very much in the minds of those out of work," he said.
Mr Guinness said the company was committed to the local Circular Head region.
Dutch Mill currently owns six dairy farms in the state's north-west.
On its website, Dutch Mill states it "will pay the attention to the quality in all matters, which may affect our customers."
"We will also cling on our three main working principles:
The company says its vision is "to be one of the best manufacturing and marketing companies of dairy products in ASEAN".

Imagine being asked to catch up with a friend and former work mate who just happens to be The Beatles' Paul McCartney?

That is what just happened to northern NSW resident and former Londoner Joanne Petersen, then Joanne Newfield, who was the personal assistant for Beatles manager Brian Epstein in the 1960s.
Ms Petersen, who now lives in the small town of Bangalow, has been invited to catch up with Sir Paul in Brisbane in December during his Australian tour.
She says it has been nearly 40 years since she has seen him and there is a lot to catch up on.
"I would be typing in the office and Paul and John would be writing songs, scrawling down lyrics, and throwing the pieces of paper on the floor," she said.
"I would look at the mess they were making and thinking to myself 'what slobs, why can't they put their rubbish in the bin?'"
Ms Petersen was close to Epstein and knew he was a gay man.
It was Ms Petersen who found Epstein dead in his Chapel Street home from an accidental drug overdose in August 1967.
She said she wished that he was alive today to see the support for gay marriage.
"I think about him a lot and would love to sit down now, at this great age, and have a conversation about the vote for same sex marriage," she said.
"Back in the sixties you couldn't come out as a gay man as it was illegal, and as the Beatles' manager he could of easily have been blackmailed or publicly humiliated.
"Brian was lonely. I saw loneliness there."

Ms Petersen was in her early twenties when she got the dream job.
She said she was dancing in an exclusive London club when she caught the eye of Ringo Starr and George Harrison.
"I heard this voice say 'so, where did you learn to dance like that?'" she said.
She turned around and saw two cheeky lads grinning at her.
"It comes naturally," she said she replied.
Both men asked for her name and she cheekily asked what their names were.
"They said they were Paul and John (Lennon) and we all laughed."
Ms Petersen told the pair she was unhappy where she worked and the pair told them to ring "Eppy", as he was looking for a new assistant.
She did, and got the job after cheating on her typing test.
Working for Epstein she spent time with the Fab Four regularly, saying they had very different personalities but all worked hard for the band, inserting their individual styles into the famous melodies.
Ms Petersen says Epstein loved the Beatles and managed their egos beautifully, saying he really was the fifth Beatle.
And she still remembers listening to the Sgt Pepper's album and being blown away.


Ms Petersen said Lennon and McCartney were good mates, but their friendship suffered during The Beatles' break-up.
Despite public opinion, she said the rift continued until Lennon was murdered in December 1980.

She believed Paul is haunted by the fact that he never got the chance to be close again to his childhood friend.
She said no-one could have predicted how influential and famous the Beatles were to become.
"I should of grabbed that half-eaten chocolate biscuit that John Lennon had eaten and put it in a bag and kept it for 40 years, and then sold it as 'A half eaten biscuit by John Lennon' and made a fortune," she laughs.
"Why didn't I do that?"

As Victoria braces for a major rainfall event this weekend, the residents of one town fear they will be hit hardest after revelations that a significant amount of recovery funding allocated to the areas after floods in 2011 have been mismanaged.
Up to 200mm of heavy rain is expected to fall over the next three days in the Central Goldfields region.
In 2011, 100mm worth of rainfall resulted in 250 homes becoming flooded in the town of Carisbrook.

The Central Goldfields Shire came under fire this week after the ABC revealed a significant amount of flood grant money meant for Carisbrook in the 2011 floods, was unaccounted for.
Documents obtained by the ABC revealed that since 2011 the Federal Government supplied $30 million in flood recovery funding to the Central Goldfields Shire Council, and the State Government committed a further $1.3 million.
Some Carisbrook residents believe only a small portion of that was spent in the town to help mitigate future flood risks but it remains unclear how much of the multi-million dollar fund can be accounted for.
Carisbrook Fire Captain Ian Boucher said residents were on edge.
"There are a lot of anxious people here, I've fielded quite a few phone calls from worried locals," he said.
"I've been phoning around our CFA members to see their availability, we've got a truck load of sand delivered to the station and a supply of sandbags in preparation.
"We're predicting even if we don't get the event they're expecting, low-line areas on the creek will flood."
Mr Boucher said the rain predicted was shaping up as worse than the 2011 floods.
"I'm very mindful of the fact of what happened in 2011 — just like everyone else I'm expecting the worst but hoping for the best.

"This doesn't paint a good picture for Carisbrook at the moment."
Carisbrook Disaster Recovery Committee President Keith McLeish said in his 75-years, he had never seen 200mm of rain predicted.
"There are a few people here very angry that six years after we tried to get something done, we still don't have drainage that could have saved 90 per cent of the town.
"I hardly slept last night and normally it takes a bit to stir me up.

"We had about 70mm here in 2011, then another 30mm that night and that just finished the town."
Former Councillor and Carisbrook resident Helen Broad said the weekend was looking as bad as 2011.
"My biggest concern is the residents and making sure we do what we can to help them out and try to prevent what happened last time," Ms Broad said.
"I've had a lot of calls from people out here worried, they want to know what's going to happen and it's questions I can't really answer.
"It saddens me to think that here we are nearly seven years down the track and we're going to be in the same situation again."
Central Goldfields Shire Interim Chief Executive Vince Haining said the shire was meeting today with the SES and Police.
"We have positioned sand out at Carisbrook because we know that's a very high risk flood environment out there," Mr Haining said.
"It's a very risky area for flooding there and we hope they will be prepared to the extent they can be.
"We need to do our very best to protect our community from floods, we don't want to see a repeat of 2011."

A 56-year-old man has died at the Inpex Ichthys gas project, just outside of Darwin, after a "serious" workplace incident.
"The deceased was working in a confined space installing insulation within a tank when the incident occurred," NT WorkSafe said in a statement.
Northern Territory police said it received a call about 8:30pm on Wednesday, informing them a man was being resuscitated at the site.
"We were made aware of a person, a male out there, a 56-year-old male under full resuscitation as a result of what appears at this stage to be a workplace incident," Duty Superintendent James O'Brien said.
"Unfortunately as a result of the incident the male didn't survive."
Duty Superintendent O'Brien said police had been investigating overnight but would not release details on what caused the incident before a report was prepared for the coroner.
In a statement, Inpex confirmed the man's death was the result of a "serious incident" at the Bladin Point construction site.

"Our heartfelt thoughts and condolences go to his family, loved ones and colleagues," it said.
"We are cooperating fully with relevant authorities."
NT WorkSafe said a prohibition notice has been issued, preventing all insulation work within tanks at the Bladin Point site.
"WorkSafe Inspectors are currently back onsite continuing their investigation," the safety watchdog said.
Inpex said it was now in the process of informing and providing counselling to its workers.
"Inpex has advised our staff of the tragedy this morning and also reminded them of the counselling and support services that are available to them and there won't be any construction activity on site today," general manager Sean Kildare said.

Banks and insurers are jeopardising their futures if they fail to prepare for climate-related risks, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) has warned.

The stark advice from the industry watchdog was delivered during a speech last night to the Centre for Policy Development in Sydney.
APRA said it had a duty to warn the institutions that it regulates, like banks, superannuation funds and insurers, if it identified a risk that could threaten their stability.
Geoff Summerhayes, an executive board member of APRA, said that included unexpected risks such as cyber crime, technology disruption or climate risk.
He said climate change was already leaving its mark, and not just ecologically.
"The sustainable insurance forums view, which APRA shares, is that climate change — and here's the crucial bit — societies response to it, are starting to affect the global economy," he said.
Mr Summerhayes gave Cyclone Debbie as an example, which devastated parts of north Queensland earlier this year.
At the latest count the insurance bill from that event topped out at $1.6 billion.
"Should extreme weather events become more frequent and intense, as scientists predict, this type of adverse economy impact will become magnified and more common," Mr Summerhayes said.
"Consequently raising awareness about climate risks and the need for resilience is entirely within APRA's regulatory mandate of promoting financial system stability.
"And in the interests of deposit holders, policy holders and superannuation fund members."
Mr Summerhayes said the APRA has established the Climate Change Financial Risk Working Group, which has begun questioning its entities about their preparedness for climate change and its associated risks.
And furthermore, he predicted that disclosure would become a major trend in global regulation.
While one of the drivers behind that will be regulatory action, he said pressure from investors would be the main player.
Mr Summerhayes cited examples from elsewhere in the world, such as France's energy transition law.
That law requires listed companies and institutions to disclose their investment portfolio contribution to the objectives of the Paris Agreement and the national energy transition strategy.
"[And] the UK and business insurance regulators gather data about market practice on sustainability issues," he said.
"At APRA we're planning a survey of regulated entities to gain a better understanding of emerging best practice. As well as an industry wide review of climate related disclosures."
He also said Australia's transition to a low carbon economy was underway and moving quickly.
ANZ's loans and specialised finance managing director, Christina Tonkin, said understanding climate change related risks was important for business.
"ANZ considers that no stone must be left unturned in the pursuit of transitioning Australia and the region to a more sustainable footing," she said.
"It's the challenge of our time and one that government, business, financiers and communities need to make a top priority."

Opposition Leader Bill Shorten has sacked Sam Dastyari from his deputy Senate whip position, saying he's lost faith in the senator's judgement.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister has announced a royal commission into the banking sector.
Look back over all the day's political developments in our blog.

!!!@@@$$$

Malcolm Turnbull has announced a royal commission into the banking sector, after sustained pressure from within his own Government and an admission by Australia's big four banks that an inquiry is necessary to restore public faith in the financial system.

A letter to the Treasurer signed by the chairpersons and chief executives of ANZ, Commonwealth, NAB and Westpac and dated today argued that even though the sector had long campaigned against it, such a measure was now in the national interest.
"Our banks have consistently argued the view that further inquiries into the sector, including a royal commission, are unwarranted," the letter said.
"However, it is now in the national interest for the political uncertainty to end."
Shortly after the letter was released, the Prime Minister announced the royal commission, saying that it was the only way to "give all Australians a greater degree of assurance" about the banking sector.
"Since the financial crisis, there have been examples of misconduct by financial institutions. Some of them extremely serious. And that's demanded a response from the institutions themselves and from government," Mr Turnbull said.
"The only way we can give all Australians a greater degree of assurance is a royal commission into misconduct into the financial services industry."

The Prime Minister described it as a "comprehensive inquiry" that would cover the nation's banks, wealth managers, superannuation providers and insurance companies.
The Government's announcement has headed off a move in the Senate where the junior Coalition partner, the Nationals, were prepared to combine with the Greens, Labor and other crossbenchers to force an inquiry to be held.
Mr Turnbull's announcement means the Government avoids the embarrassment of its own side of politics compelling it to hold an inquiry.
But it is politically embarrassing for Mr Turnbull to have been forced into walking away from his previous refusal to hold an inquiry.

Nationals senator Barry O'Sullivan had been working with other parties and was prepared to pass legislation for an inquiry that, until today, the Government has been strongly resisting.

But Senator O'Sullivan insisted the Prime Minister was not "dragged to the table" on a banking royal commission because of his private member's bill.
"I don't think that the Prime Minister had a change of heart. I think we've got a Prime Minister who has listened and had the capacity to make and support a decision and I think that's a positive thing," he said.
"He was making his own journey in relation to these matters.
"I am not going to go into deep comment about the historical aspects or the current aspects until I have had a chance to look at the details."

But George Christensen, one of the Nationals who vowed to support Senator O'Sullivan's bill, was not so convinced.
"I just don't understand why it took a number of National Party backbenchers to drag the Prime Minister kicking and screaming to this decision," he said.
"But we've got the decision, it's a good decision.
"I'm hoping that this is going to be a thorough root-and-branch review of the banking sector.
"It's going to weed out these systemic cases of misconduct, and perhaps criminal actions by big banks, and we'll get some justice for the victims of banking misconduct."
Mr Turnbull conceded there had been "a lot of changes in the political environment" but said the decision was one that came from the Cabinet.
The Federal Opposition has been pressuring the Government to hold a royal commission since April last year, when it announced that a Labor government would call one.

Labor has argued for more than 18 months that a royal commission would make the sector stronger.
Opposition Leader Bill Shorten said the timing of today's announcement was "one of Mr Turnbull's greatest failures of leadership".
"If Mr Turnbull had have listened to Labor, we would've had a royal commission and it would have been done by now, with its recommendations being implemented," Mr Shorten said.
"We are deeply concerned that even today, the Prime Minister said a royal commission was 'regrettable'.
"Turnbull and his Government voted in the Parliament more than 20 times to protect the banks from a royal commission."
The royal commission will have 12 months to complete its inquiries, with a final report expected to be delivered by February 1, 2019.

Mr Turnbull said it would investigate "how financial institutions had dealt with cases of misconduct in the past, and whether those examples expose issues in terms of the cultural and governance issues in terms of the regulation and supervision of the industry".
"This will not be an open-ended commission, it will not put capitalism on trial," he said.
Treasurer Scott Morrison emphasised the royal commission did not undermine the strength of Australian banks.
"Australia's banks are unquestionably strong, nothing that we have announced today changes this or gives any reason to question this, on the part of the Government," Mr Morrison said.
"This is an important message for markets and the international financial community, it does not question the robust nature of our prudential system."
Crossbench MP Bob Katter has already suggested social justice campaigner Tim Costello as a potential candidate to lead the royal commission.
The Government has not yet appointed anyone to the role but said it would be a "distinguished former or serving judicial officer".

A port launching rockets into space from North-East Arnhem Land won't benefit Aboriginal people and the Northern Territory Government is only promoting the project in its own interest, says a local independent politician.
Canberra-based commercial venture Equatorial Launch Australia (ELA) has signed a sub-lease with the Aboriginal Gumatj Corporation to build Australia's first commercial rocket launching facility at a remote site near Nhulunbuy, in the Top End's Gulf of Carpentaria.
Construction of the Arnhem Space Centre is set to start next year, and ELA is hopeful rocket launching could begin at the end of 2018.
The NT Government has talked up the ambitious project and says it will bring more than $100 million to the region, creating about 70 jobs during the construction and operational phases at the 275-hectare site.
"I think the NT Government is pushing this for its own good," Yingiya Mark Guyula, the independent Member for Nhulunbuy, said.
"Providing jobs, they say, but who is the job for? People out there are not interested, people out there are not as excited as the Government is saying.
"They are confused, they are worried about what this is going to bring."
Nhulunbuy, created as a mining town hub in the 1960s, has been struggling since the closure of Rio Tinto's alumina refinery in 2014, and has had its population halved to about 2,000 people since then.
Mr Guyula said the space centre would only foster private development, and exceeded local ambition.
"A space industry… it's not something that we intend to do. People just want to set up small businesses, just want to take our infrastructure resources back onto country," he said.
"There's enough trouble in the homelands out there already without this industry coming in that's providing big dollar signs to the rest of the world … to Australia."

A spokesman for the NT Government said it has helped to facilitate negotiations between the Northern Land Council (NLC), Equatorial Launch Australia, and the Gumatj Aboriginal Corporation, which represents the traditional owners from one of the local Aboriginal clans in the Nhulunbuy area.
The spokesman said that there had been no complaints about the process to date.
Mr Guyula said the NLC and the NT Government had rushed through consultation with local people affected by the project, and had so far provided limited detail.
"The question is: Have I failed my people out there? Or has the Government, the Northern Land Council failed us?" asked Mr Guyula.
"I need to push through and remind the NLC, remind the NT Government, that they have not properly consulted Yolngu people out there."
NLC CEO Joe Morrison refuted Mr Guyula's claims.
"I reject that assumption that Mark Guyula's put out there that the consultation process was fraught," Mr Morrison said.
"We're more than happy to brief him on a range of matters, and we'd certainly like to do that in relation to the space base because we feel that we've complied with the Aboriginal Land Rights Act in ensuring that the right people were consulted, and affected people were also notified and understood the nature of the proposal."

Australian shares are headed for a weak start amid a volatile session on Wall Street, in which investors dumped tech stocks in favour of the big banks.

Technology was, by far, the worst performing sector on the S&P 500, falling by 2.6 per cent.
To put that figure in perspective, the second weakest sector overnight was utilities, which actually rose by a slight 0.1 per cent.
While shares in the technology giants Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google plunged by as much as 3-6 per cent overnight, financial stocks enjoyed a strong lift as investors repositioned their portfolios.
Shares in JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs and Bank of America posted gains, because investors have high hopes that the US Senate Republicans will pass a bill to cut corporate tax rates by Friday morning (AEDT).
They are also betting on the Federal Reserve announcing an interest rate hike in December.
The market has priced in a higher than 90 per cent chance of American interest rates rising next month.
Furthermore, the Commerce Department released its second estimate of GDP, which showed the US economy expanded by 3.3 per cent on an annual basis, beating market expectations.
The Dow Jones closed at a fresh record, rising 0.4 per cent to 23,941.
While the S&P 500 ended flat, the Nasdaq fell sharply by 1.3 per cent.
ASX futures have fallen by 0.1 per cent (7 points), which signals the local bourse is likely to open lower today.
In local economic news, the Bureau of Statistics will release its latest building approvals and private capital expenditure figures.
Reuters-polled economists are expecting building approvals in October to drop by 1.8 per cent.
"Our economists expect Australia’s capex [capital expenditure] report to reveal an increase of 1 per cent in the third quarter after a similar 0.8 per cent growth in the second quarter," said NAB's senior foreign exchange strategist Rodrigo Catril.
However, ANZ's economist were not as optimistic, and are instead expecting a 1.95 per cent drop.
"The number will be watched not only for its implications for third quarter GDP growth, but also broader business investment plans," said ANZ's Martin Whetton.
The Reserve Bank will also release figures on private sector credit.
The Australian dollar has fallen by 0.3 per cent to 75.70 US cents, as the greenback lifted over higher expectations of a US rate hike by mid-December.

As Adani angles for Chinese money for its giant coal mine in North Queensland, China's Australian embassy has made clear that any backing from Chinese state enterprises would need central government approval.
Senior embassy officials have also told opponents of the mining venture that no applications for funding have been made, despite Adani insiders claiming recently that finance from China had been secured.
Over the past month, businessman and environmentalist Geoff Cousins and prominent investment banker Mark Burrows, AO, have held talks with Chinese embassy officials in Canberra to lobby against Adani's Australian project, amid reports Adani was close to finalising a deal for Chinese backing.
"Myself and Mark Burrows went to see senior officials from the Chinese embassy; we explained that China might think that Australians supported the Adani mine and we gave them a lot of evidence that that was not the case," Mr Cousins told the ABC.
"The Chinese embassy was very forthright in saying that investment from a Chinese corporation would require the approval of the central government and that also no such proposal had been put."

A director of Adani's Australian subsidiary Adani Mining recently boasted at a public function that Adani had secured finance from China and would soon be announcing the deal.
Although it disputed a report that it would no longer require a loan from the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility, Adani has not denied reports that finance from China was imminent.
"I'm aware of that," Mr Cousins said.
"It's just another in the series of lies that Adani has told the public of Australia and the Australian Government.
"I mean, these things are simply not true.
"If you went back through the history of Adani's statements in Australia since this project was first mooted, they have never met a single deadline that's been set and they have told so many of these lies that I can't believe that they haven't been held to account for them."
Adani has on numerous occasions pushed back the start date for the mine.
Adani had claimed it would have finance in place by the end of this year and, later, said it expected to finalise finance by the end of the Indian fiscal year in March.
Nonetheless, opponents of the Adani mine are clearly worried by the prospect of China providing finance for the venture.
Yesterday, 15 environment and conservation groups wrote to the chairman and president of China Machinery Engineering Corporation (CMEC), which has been linked to the Carmichael mine and railway.

The letter described it as an environmentally unsound, financially risky venture, said it was deeply unpopular with most Australians, and asked CMEC to clarify its intentions.
CMEC has removed from its website a statement about meeting executives from Adani and its engineering contractor, Downer EDI, which expressed CMEC's desire to be involved in the venture.
Mr Cousins and Mr Burrows met officials at China's embassy in Canberra on November 14, with Mr Cousins having a further telephone conference on November 23.
Mr Cousins said his approach to the Chinese embassy was prompted in part by the actions of Coalition MP Barnaby Joyce and trade minister Steve Ciobo who wrote to Chinese officials in support of Adani's Carmichael mine.
"There's a letter from the Australian Government to a foreign government offering support for a commercial enterprise that isn't even an Australian company. It's a foreign company," Mr Cousins said.
"I've been in business a long time one way or another; I don't think I've even heard of such a letter being written previously."

In his meetings with Chinese embassy officials, Mr Cousins praised China's progress on its commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and its global leadership on addressing climate change.
"It's fair to say that China has filled the leadership vacuum that has been left by the United States' withdrawal," he said.

"I can't speak for what China may eventually decide, but I seriously doubt it would want to damage its international reputation and the wonderful progress it has made by funding such a disastrous project.
"It just seems at odds with government policy. I mean, the most senior government officials only recently came out and made statements that made it quite clear that they wanted to protect and develop their reputation in these areas."
Chinese funding for the project is becoming more critical as prospects for a subsidised loan of up to $1 billion from the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility for the mine railway fade.
The Labor Party, which looks likely to form a government in Queensland, has pledged to effectively veto the loan.
Pauline Hanson's One Nation Party, which has secured at least one seat in the state parliament, is also opposed to the loan.
Banks across the globe have refused to fund the Carmichael coal mine because of doubts about its financial viability and its potential to worsen global warming.

In the aftermath of allegations around TV personality Don Burke, Channel Nine has established a helpline where employees can access an independent counselling service and report instances of "past behaviour" within the organisation.
A joint ABC/Fairfax investigation uncovered claims from a number of women who worked with Burke in the late 1980s and 1990s.
It comes in the wake of the Harvey Weinstein scandal, with women all over the world revealing their experiences of workplace sexual harassment.
CEO Hugh Marks announced the helpline in an email to staff, saying the organisation "can and will take steps to ensure that former employees, perhaps with old grievances, are supported".
Mr Marks said any matters which were raised and required further action would be addressed appropriately either internally or, if required, externally of Nine.
"In light of the appalling allegations this week of sexual assault, harassment and misconduct by Don Burke I wanted to write to all staff to reaffirm Nine's commitment to maintaining a culture that is inclusive, supportive and respectful," Mr Marks said.

"As much as we might like to sometimes we unfortunately cannot rewrite history.
"… It is fundamental that as a team we all share some simple expectations. And it is in this context that we all accept our role in ensuring we have and maintain a culture that has zero tolerance of inappropriate workplace behaviour.
"Everyone is entitled to come to work at Nine confident that our workplace is safe and that inappropriate behaviour will be dealt with effectively."
The counselling will be provided to former employees without charge.

Perth is set to become the first Australian city, and one of the first places in the world, to trial on-demand driverless cars capable of picking up passengers.
Operating in much the same way as ride-sharing services like Uber, customers will be able to order a ride using a smart-phone app.
A car will then arrive to take them wherever they need to go — only without a driver.
The WA Government has partnered with the Royal Automobile Club (RAC) and the French company behind the technology, NAVYA, to bring several driverless cars to the state for testing next year.
Perth was one of three cities chosen for the trial, the others being Paris and a US city yet to be announced.
The vehicles are set to arrive in April 2018 and will be tested on private roads before being taken onto city streets later in the year.

Members of the public will be able to sign up to be passengers during the public road tests, in much the same way as the trials of an automated shuttle bus in South Perth, also made by NAVYA.
Unlike the bus, the driverless cars have leather seats for six passengers and can reach a maximum speed of 90 kilometres an hour.
But it is expected that like the buses, speeds will be regulated during trials — and the RAC will also have a human chaperone onboard, capable of overriding the computer systems.
When operating automatically, the vehicles employ multi-sensor technology including four radars, six cameras and two links to global navigation satellite systems.

The features give the vehicles 3D perception that allows them to map the environment, detect obstacles and respond accordingly.
RAC WA's CEO Terry Agnew said it was hoped driverless technology could one day eliminate the 90 per cent of road crashes that were caused by human error.
He said the technology would tie in nicely with Perth's existing transport systems, and suggested the trial could put the city at the forefront of the "driverless revolution".
"The driverless passenger vehicles will largely be shorter journeys, they'll be inner-city and very often they might be simply connecting people up to public transport," he said
"So it complements the existing system rather than replacing it.
"It's very important with any new technology to stay ahead of the pack and this is the logical next phase."
Mr Agnew said while the technology was very close — with the service potentially operating by 2021 — it was important the community was ready for it and participated in the trial.
"It gives them the opportunity to try rather than read about it or be told about it," he said.
"Quite often you can see new technology is introduced and the community isn't ready for it.
"We want to ensure that Western Australians are ready for that."
There is no definite timetable for when the public trials will begin, with the RAC saying they will not go ahead until both it and the State Government are entirely comfortable.

Underutilised bus services in Perth are costing the WA Government more than $410 million a year, a new report has found, as fewer people catch buses and services become less efficient.
The cost is set to rise nearly $40 million over the next three years unless fares are increased, more people start catching buses or operating costs are slashed, the report by auditor-general Colin Murphy has found.

Mr Murphy said just 17 per cent of the cost of running the service in the past financial year — $85 million — was recouped in passenger fares.
"Despite increased capacity, higher frequency services and coverage of new residential areas, fewer people are using buses now than four years ago," the report found.
"As a result, revenue from fares dropped 7.7 per cent between 2012-13 and 2016-17.
"Bus services are 28 per cent less efficient than 10 years ago. It now costs $1.18 per passenger kilometre compared with $0.92 (in real terms) in 2006-07."

It recommended the best way to reduce costs would be to for the Public Transport Authority (PTA) to cut routes, especially those that duplicate train routes.
Cutting the six services that run non-stop along Kwinana Freeway between Canning Bridge and Elizabeth Quay, for example, would save an estimated $4 million and 100,000 bus trips a year.
"PTA has good information about bus routes and how passengers use the network, but it is not using it effectively to identify which service changes will produce the greatest efficiencies," Mr Murphy found.

Bus services were contracted out to private companies in 1998, a move that was expected to save $40 million per year.
Instead, costs are rising to an "unsustainable" level, and there are significant further outlays on the horizon, Mr Murphy found.
Replacement of ageing buses and expansion of the current fleet is set to cost the PTA almost $680 million over a 10-year period, including the replacement of its entire fleet 512 compressed natural gas buses.
The PTA has tried to get more bus priority lanes installed in a bid to boost passenger numbers.
"But PTA does not own the roads and there is no specific enabling legislation to establish bus priority measures. This often results in substantial delays," the report found.
In response to the report, the PTA said its contracting arrangements followed world's best practice and bus operators from around the world had copied its model.
However, it said Perth's low density "brings with it the very difficult challenge of balancing … obligations to provide a reasonable level of service to the more vulnerable people in our community, who often have no alternative transport options, and making the most efficient use of our available resources."
About 15 per cent of homes in Perth do not have easy access to bus services.
The PTA said it was looking at "new and innovative" ways to boost passenger numbers, but it was confident this would happen as the economy improved.

Armed landowners in the Papua New Guinea highlands say they have blocked access to gas wells because of an ongoing dispute with the Government over the payment of royalties.
The landowners in PNG's Hela province have cut down trees and blocked roads and say they have stopped police from taking back control of the area.
They are demanding the PNG Government pay them outstanding royalties, which are the subject of a protracted legal dispute.
"They have cut down trees from wellhead B to G, blocking the roads," said Dickson Ango, the chairman of one of the petroleum development licence areas.
"The security personnel have withdrawn and landowners have taken control of that area."
Mr Ango said the landowners were protesting the PNG Government's failure to pay a promised 20 million kina ($AUD8 million) in royalties for the gas.
They promised to pay to the landowners — they even wrote a dummy cheque and gave it to the landowners — but that money was not in the account," Mr Ango said.
"They showed us the cheque and they said, you see it, you feel it, you touch it and then they withdraw it and they never pay it to us."

The PNG Government has previously said it cannot pay royalties to some landowner groups because of disputes over clan vetting and an ongoing legal case.
It has been negotiating with landowners in an attempt to resolve the disputes and prevent unrest at the project and along the pipeline.
The operator of the PNG Liquefied Natural Gas project, ExxonMobil, said its production was continuing at normal levels, but it has withdrawn all non-essential staff from the area.
"ExxonMobil PNG is continuing to monitor ongoing tension in the Highlands (Hides, Angore, Komo) areas," a spokeswoman said.
"Staffing at the Hides Gas Conditioning Plant remains at essential personnel only.
"The Hides Gas Conditioning Plant is operating safely at normal production levels."
Police in Hela Province were not able to be reached for comment.
Hela Province has been the scene of some of PNG's worst tribal fighting over the past four years, with provincial authorities estimating at least 200 people have been killed.

The consumer watchdog has launched Federal Court action against Australia's largest caravan manufacturer, Jayco Corporation, over faulty caravans.

The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) alleges the company tried to prevent customers from getting refunds after they were sold defective caravans, costing tens of thousands of dollars.
It is alleged that between 2013 and 2015, Jayco breached consumer laws when it knew the caravans were faulty, even after repeated and failed attempts to repair them.
The ACCC said it had received numerous complaints about the company's behaviour but had taken action on behalf of four customers.
"The numerous defects in the Jayco caravans sold to these four consumers became apparent at the time of purchase or very soon after, and included issues such as misalignment in the roof, which did not close properly and leaked," ACCC chairman Rod Sims said.
Mr Sims said despite repeated requests for refunds or replacements, the company failed to comply with the law by telling buyers they could only get repairs.
"This understandably caused a lot of distress for the customers," he said.
Jayco is a family-owned Victorian business and has been operating since 1975.
Its website states the company has built over 180,000 RVs to date.
The ACCC said the legal case illustrated a more systemic problem with the industry.
While action is only being taken against Jayco, the watchdog said it had received more than 1,000 complaints about caravans.
"This is an industry that does need to be put on notice," Mr Sims said.
"Our aim is to change behaviour and say to the industry, you should not be behaving like this."
Mr Sims said caravans were not quick, easy purchases and it could be very distressing to get the run-around from a company.
"People put great weight on these purchases and they aren't purchases that are made often," he said.
"People are entitled to expect that the caravan they purchase will be of acceptable quality."
The ACCC is seeking financial penalties, consumer redress orders, and costs.
A spokesperson for Jayco said it had no comment at this stage.
The Jayco models in the ACCC's sights are the Swan Outback camper trailer, the Expanda pop-top caravan, the Expanda Outback pop-top caravan, and the Journey Outback pop-top caravan.

Australian music has a pretty big problem: not enough people are listening to it.
At least, that's if you go by the Australian pop charts.
Last week there were only two songs by Australian artists in the ARIA top 50 singles chart. This week, as Australian artists celebrate another ARIA awards, there are three.

In the US Billboard top 50, by contrast, all but a handful of tracks are homegrown.
Junkee reported in August there still had not been an Australian song hit number 1 in Australia in 2017. That trend has continued.
Music publicist Stephen Green said the problem was complex.
"I think the concern most people have at the moment about the complete lack of Australian music in the charts is whether it's actually a systemic, structural thing," he said.
Streaming, quickly becoming the most common way people consume music, is now what most informs the make-up of the ARIA singles charts, since digital download numbers are declining and physical CD singles no longer exist.
"As the streaming market has become a global, not a local, market, in our view Australian artists may be disadvantaged as they may not be as well-known internationally," Maria Amato, CEO of the Australian Independent Record Labels Association, said.
Not appearing in the charts has flow-on effects, because the big radio stations play the hits. They may be less inclined to give prominence to Australian songs in popular timeslots if few are charting.
"It's the chicken and the egg situation," Mr Green said. "How do you have a hit if no-one is playing your song?"
Some in the industry say the popularity of playlists on streaming platforms like Spotify, Apple Music and Google Play is an issue. The really popular playlists are curated overseas; Australian artists often don't feature.
But Spotify said nine out of the 10 top playlists that drive streams in Australia predominately feature "domestic repertoire".

Yes.
About 25 per cent of the music they play must be local. However, some believe they are not hitting their mark.
"From the data we've seen, commercial radio may not in some instances be strictly compliant with the quota," Ms Amato said.

"Our concern longer-term is that a singles chart biased against Australian artists will just reinforce commercial radio's arguments against local content."
APRA, the peak body for distributing royalties to musicians when their music is played on the radio, is looking into the accuracy of the local content reports commercial radio stations publish.
It said it would review Commercial Radio Australia's upcoming report on quota compliance "extremely carefully", comparing it against its own data, to make sure they are hitting the mandated targets.
"If you talk to people in radio," Mr Green said, "they are there to play the hits, and Australian music is not in the charts, therefore they are not playing Australian music.
"Which obviously then means people aren't hearing it, therefore it doesn't get in the charts, and it's a spiral situation down."
But Joan Warner, chief executive officer of Commercial Radio Australia, said claims commercial stations were not hitting their quotas, or doing so by filling non-peak shifts with Australian music, were "mischievous, ill-informed and just plain wrong".
"The commercial radio industry is a big supporter of Australian music, with on average one in every five tracks played being Australian," she said, adding that many commercial stations played more Australian music than they were required to.
The ABC's triple j has a self-imposed quota of 40 per cent.

There are no easy answers, but some suggest the streaming giants have a role to play.
Mr Green suggested Spotify might, for example, give more prominence in algorithms to playlists curated in Australia, and the industry could, "work with Apple and Spotify to work out how Australian-based playlists can be recommended to people at a higher [rate]".
Spotify, which has emphasised growth in the music industry and decline in music piracy since it launched in Australia five years ago, is encouraging "more open dialogue" on the issue.
"Whilst we are already having conversations with key stakeholders in the industry on this topic, we must also acknowledge that we are just one part of a local ecosystem that must work collaboratively on this issue," Alicia Sbrugnera, senior music editor at Spotify Australia & NZ, said.
Chris Bowen, CEO of Music Australia, said he had heard increasing talk of the need for more Australian-curated playlists, but that it was still early days — that the industry was still figuring out how to champion Australian music in the streaming age.

Usually people jump out of planes to get their kicks but two French daredevils have gone one better: boarding a plane mid-air.
First, they had to jump off a mountain.

Video shows wingsuit fliers Fred Fugen and Vince Reffet leaping off Switzerland's Jungfrau mountain.
The pair soar low over the frozen landscape as they approach the small plane.
It is silent, except for the whistling wind, and soon, the sounds of a man in the plane calling out an unusual instruction for a plane mid-flight.
"Go for entry, go for entry," he says.
The pair hurtle through the open door and cheers ring out.
The fliers, along with pilot Philippe Bouvier and navigator Yves Rossy, completed more than 100 practice flights in preparation for the spectacular stunt with many attempts not going to plan.

Welcome to Queensland's Sunshine Coast — where having a full-time job, degree and trade qualification is not enough to fund rental housing.
Daniel, who did not want to use his last name, grew up in Sydney and would often drive past social housing complexes but never imagined he would need housing support — especially not at as he approached the age of 40.
"I didn't think I was going to find myself in a situation where I needed to rely on this," he said.
"I have a trade, I have a degree, I work 50 hours a week and I've been permanently employed from 20 years since I left school."
After moving from Sydney to the Sunshine Coast, Daniel and his wife Sophie struggled to find a suitable home.
The couple needed room for their young son Luka as well as a house on one level to accommodate Sophie, who is recovering from a stroke.
"We were almost in crisis — to use the word — we probably spent six months and found nothing that suited us," Daniel said.
"I'd always been told — Queensland, Sunshine Coast, lower cost of living — you'll be fine.
"Rental prices are cheaper compared to Sydney, but the wage is considerably lower as well, so I found for the first time in my life that I was in a predicament."
Daniel and his family are not alone — the national Rental Affordability Index has ranked the Sunshine Coast region among the least affordable for tenants, compared to average incomes.
The index shows for a household on the median Sunshine Coast income — $65,000 per year — looking for a three-bedroom house, which is the standard size for the region, all suburbs are rated either "unaffordable" or "severely unaffordable".

National Shelter, the lobby group that helps compile the index, said there were 1.3 million Australian households in housing stress, meaning they spent more than one-third of their income on rent.
A glance at rental property listings on the Sunshine Coast shows how difficult it can be to find a reasonably-priced rental.
In Noosa Heads, one of the suburbs ranked least affordable, the cheapest house for rent is $700 per week — a big stretch for someone on less than $80,000 per year.

Even a hinterland suburb like Eumundi is difficult — you will need a $960 a week to afford the only rental available there.

The Real Estate Institute of Queensland (REIQ) estimates that for the past five years, the Sunshine Coast has had a rental vacancy rate of just 1 per cent.
Andrew Elvin got so fed-up with the rental problems in his area that he set up his own not-for-profit agency, Purpose Real Estate, to help people find affordable rents.
"Families are paying at least 30 per cent or 40 per cent of their household income just to pay the rent and this is an issue that really needs to be addressed," Mr Elvin said.
Eventually, Mr Elvin helped Daniel and his family find a home in Peregian Springs.

But even with a cheaper arrangement, there is only $400 left after rent each week.
"Four-hundred dollars sounds like a lot, but after you spend $80 on petrol, more on groceries — you can imagine how quickly it goes," Daniel said.
"We all go through certain circumstances, change — you take on a new family, move to a new area, and you find yourself in a situation.
"It's just fantastic that there was support available for us."

A milk plant in Tasmania's north-west has been sold to a Thai company a day before it was to close, with one worker describing the months of waiting as a "rollercoaster ride".

Murray Goulburn has sold its plant at Edith Creek to Dutch Mill — a company originally from Thailand with an Australian subsidiary.
The announcement came via a press release issued today, 24 hours before the company was set to close the doors.
Dutch Mill has already been purchasing dairy farms in the Circular Head region.
Mayor Daryl Quilliam, whose council incorporates the Edith Creek area, said it was good news for the small community of about 8,000 people.
"They're going to continue operate it as a factory, I'm not exactly sure what products but it will be similar products to what has been made out there in the past," Alderman Quilliam said.
"They will require a lot of the people that have been there in the past, so that's great news."

For Brendan Costello, an electrician at Edith Creek, the news came as a complete surprise.
"It's been pretty hard a lot of mixed emotions and some people are still not sure what they're doing.
"It's a bit of a rollercoaster ride, to be honest."
Mr Costello welcomed the announcement, and said he hoped the new owners would continue to employ locals.
"It's just great to see that there is a future there, especially after months of uncertainty."
Workers have previously told the ABC they have been left in the dark during the sale process.

Dutch Mill Australia said Australia's Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB) approval did not apply to the sale.
The threshold for FIRB approval is $55 million.
The ABC understands rival offers for the facility were in the region of $12 million to $19 million.
Anthony Guinness, spokesperson for Dutch Mill Australia, said the company expected to open the plant in the second quarter of 2018.
"What is important to us is engaging with the community in that three-month period and talking to them about milk supply ... about employment and that's obviously very much in the minds of those out of work as of tomorrow," he said.
He said there were no concrete plans on what would be produced at the factory and the Federal and Tasmanian governments had not offered inducements to buy it.
"We'll be talking as how we best go about that, once we've assessed what products can be economically produced at that site," Mr Guinness said.
Dutch Mill currently owns six dairy farms in the region.
Murray Goulburn said the factory's closure would go ahead tomorrow as planned because the sale would not be completed until early 2018.
"We thank Edith Creek employees for their significant contribution to Murray Goulburn," company CEO Ari Mervis said in a statement.
"The decision to close this processing site was difficult to make, however a necessary step on the journey to ensure the competitiveness of Murray Goulburn.
"We congratulate Dutch Mill on their acquisition of Edith Creek, and wish them well for the future," Mr Mervis said.
"Murray Goulburn continues to employ approximately 55 people across our Smithton processing facility, Murray Goulburn Trading store and in the Field Services team supporting local suppliers," a company spokesperson added.
Tasmania's Labor and Liberal parties welcomed the news in separate statements.

Australia is in the grip of a housing crisis and the rental market is failing too many people — especially older women, according to the latest Rental Affordability Index (RAI).

The report, released today by the National Shelter, Community Sector Banking and SGS, found low-income households could no longer afford to live in metropolitan areas.
Pensioners and students were the most vulnerable, with some of them winding up homeless.
Adrian Pisarski, executive officer of National Shelter, was involved with compiling the index and said there was, "virtually no affordable housing in any Australian city for people on low incomes".
"This is now representative of a true housing crisis in Australia and a true market failure," he said.
Sydney remained the worst city to rent, bleeding some households of almost 90 per cent of their incomes.
Hobart was the second worst area, due to the number of people there living on low incomes.
And then it was glitzy holiday destinations like Noosa on the Sunshine Coast, or the Gold Coast in south east Queensland.


Mr Pisarski said problems arise when lower-income households spend more than a third of their income on rent.

"We are expecting that homelessness would have risen quite sharply," he said.
"All of the reports that we get from services across Australia is their services are under increasing stress.
"We know that there have been many reports about older people suffering from homelessness, older women in particular."
In addition to urgent tax reforms to stop over-priced property investment, Mr Pisarski said the private sector needed to invest more in community housing.
"We need to have the right incentives in place to encourage a build-to-rent sector in Australia," he said.

Plunging into homelessness can happen in the blink of an eye.

Julie, 61, experienced it first hand after having to leave her well-paid job.
"I could not deal with day-to-day things like paying my rent, just paying bills basically," she said.
"This led to me losing everything — house, car, you name it.
"At the time I thought this was my own personal phenomena, how could this happen to people like me?
"But I don't think this is unusual, from what I understand these days."
Her situation was exacerbated by struggles with anxiety and depression.
But Julie, who did not want to give her last name, said Centrelink just was not enough to pay rent in Melbourne.
"I couldn't afford to think about private rental, because I couldn't control my life," she said.
"I became sleeping at friends, to actually going up to the high country and sleeping in cattlemen's huts."

Parts of Adelaide's foothills and foreshore are now officially unaffordable for renters, the latest Rental Affordability Index (RAI) has revealed.
The RAI is generated biannually by housing advocacy organisation National Shelter, Community Sector Banking and SGS Economics and Planning.
The index has identified Adelaide's least affordable rental suburbs as Stirling, Echunga, Belair and Glenalta, where average households would pay up to 34 per cent of their income for a new rental.
The RAI classifies a suburb as "unaffordable" when the average rental price exceeds 30 per cent of the average household income.
Suburbs like Happy Valley, Flagstaff Hill, Henley Beach South, West Lakes and Tennyson also made the list of the city's least affordable suburbs for renters.
"There has been some change in the geographic spread of affordability in greater Adelaide," the RAI report stated.
"The situation in the foothill areas of Belair, Flagstaff Hill out to Happy Valley and Chandlers Hill has worsened since last release and are now considered unaffordable."
Affordability was also worsening in fast-growing outer areas including Mount Barker and Nairne.
Shelter SA's executive director Dr Alice Clark said the report confirmed that rental affordability was getting "worse and worse" in South Australia.
"If you're renting a place that's $1,000 a week and you're earning $5,000 a week, it's clearly not an issue," she said.
"But what we're particularly interested in is people living on low incomes who are paying more than 30 per cent of their income on their housing, and that can go as high as 70 per cent for some households.
"That leaves very little for people to live on and to afford very basic things, like food and electricity."

Unsurprisingly, outlying areas in Adelaide's north and south were more affordable than suburbs closer to the CBD.
Property manager Mark Leslie was critical of the report, saying it was simply "outlining the obvious".
"If renters go to the top suburbs in Adelaide, they will be unaffordable ... in any city in the world, you can pick out the most expensive suburbs and say they are unaffordable to renters," he said.
"That is like saying to a person buying their first car that a Mercedes, Jaguar and Rolls Royce are unaffordable and the costs of these cars needs to be reduced."
Mr Leslie said there were "plenty of homes available" in Adelaide's more affordable suburbs.
"I think this report is just trying to peddle fear in the community," he said.
According to the report, the average rental price for Adelaide overall was about 25 per cent of a household's income.
Dr Clark said Adelaide was now comparable to Sydney and Melbourne when viewed through the eyes of a prospective renter on a low income.
"In terms of people living on low incomes, Adelaide and South Australia [generally] are no different to the rest of the country," she said.
"We always hear so much about the eastern states but if you're living on a low income, there is nothing affordable in the private rental market."
Dr Clark said more investment in public housing and a greater focus on improving housing affordability nationally were needed to alleviate the problem.
"I think [the situation] is made worse in South Australia by the fact that we have such high unemployment," she said.
"We actually lack direction in terms of a national housing strategy ... targeted to improve housing affordability and reduce homelessness."

Banking stocks surged overnight, which sent the US and British stock markets flying.

Nearly every sector on Wall Street traded higher, with financials among the best performers.
Financials stocks had their biggest jump in more than two weeks, with JPMorgan and Bank of America shares soaring by 3.5 and 4 per cent respectively.
This was in reaction to comments made by Jerome Powell at his confirmation hearing before the US Senate Banking Committee.
Mr Powell is President Donald Trump's pick to be the new Federal Reserve chair next year.
The Fed chair-nominee said current banking regulations were "tough enough", and he supported "tailoring" regulations to alleviate the burden on smaller banks.
In addition, Mr Powell signalled the US central bank is likely to raise interest rates next month.
"The case for raising interest rates at our next meeting is coming together," Mr Powell said.
Asked if that meant the Fed would raise rates, he replied: "I think the conditions are supportive of doing that."
The Dow Jones was the index which had the largest gains, adding 1.1 per cent to 23,837.
This was followed by the S&P 500 (+1pc) and Nasdaq (+0.5pc).
In Europe, the financials sector lifted after the the Bank of England released its annual stress test results.
The BOE found the UK's seven largest banks would still be able to lend money even if Britain entered a "hard Brexit" scenario and left the European Union abruptly.
"The [BoE] ... judges that the banking system can continue to support the real economy, even in the unlikely event of a disorderly Brexit," BOE governor Mark Carney said at a news conference.
But he said it was in the interests of both Britain and the EU to reach a deal before Brexit in March 2019, despite slow progress so far.
"In the event of a sharp disorderly Brexit, there will be an economic impact on households, on businesses," Mr Carney said.
"There will be lost markets before new markets are found, and there will be some pain associated with that."
This was also the first time since 2014 — when the BOE launched its stress tests — that no bank needed to raise extra funds to strengthen its capital position.
London's FTSE was the best performing European bourse overnight, gaining more than 1 per cent to 7,561.
Given the strong lead from global stock markets, Australian shares are likely to open higher today.
SPI futures jumped by 0.7 per cent (or 40 points), which is also an indicator of the ASX's likely early-trade direction.
The Australian dollar fell slightly below the 76 US cent mark.
It has also dropped against the British pound (-0.4 per cent), but has strengthened against the euro (+0.4 per cent) and Japanese yen (+0.3 per cent).

Australia loves Paul Kelly again, Gang of Youths rocked out, Harry Styles got mildly political and Sia was so well camouflaged she could not be seen at the ARIA Awards.
At the awards ceremony on Tuesday night at Sydney's Star Casino, Gang of Youths cemented their status as one of Australia's leading rock bands by winning Album of the Year.
The Sydney band went into the ARIAs with the most nominations, and ended up winning Best Group and Best Rock Album for their creation Go Farther In Lightness.
On stage, lead singer David Le'aupepe stressed the importance of a multicultural Australia, pointing out that each member of the band was an immigrant.
"This country was built on a strong Indigenous people and on the backs of immigrants," the pacific islander frontman said.
"To be heralded in the cultural and entertainment landscape in Australia is quite something.
"The presumption of Pacific islanders is they play footy, do security or play R'n'B and that's just not the case."
The charismatic songwriter has dealt with intense mental health issues, attempting to end his own life in 2014, but his music is his victory march.
"A mate of mine gave me a ring and told me not to [end my life]," he said.
"I channelled all the horrible energy I had and put it into something meaningful and positive.
"A lot of people gawk at that but it gave me hope like I never had before."
The group's wins took their ARIA tally to four — the band won the Producer of the Year Award for the album with Adrian Breakspear in a ceremony earlier this year.

Music legend Kelly, who brought down the house with his classic hit Dumb Things, also won four awards including Best Male Artist and Best Adult Contemporary album for Life Is Fine.
Australia's favourite camouflaging artist Sia was crowned best female artist for her single The Greatest (featuring Kendrick Lamar), a strong win when all other nominees in the category were chosen for albums.
Her camouflage was so good, she was nowhere to be seen at The Star.
Whilst the night belonged to Gang of Youths and Kelly, some of music's biggest talents also used this year's ARIAs to make their voices heard on political issues.
Styles, who took out Best International Artist, took the opportunity to praise Australia on its recent Yes vote in the same-sex marriage postal survey.
"Congratulations on your latest political decision," the former One Direction member said.
Later during his performance of his latest single Kiwi, Styles experienced technical difficulties and started the song again, with host Richard Wilkins telling him "nothing's your fault man".

A.B. Original won best Urban and Best Independent Release for their controversial album Reclaim Australia which broaches issues including racism, Indigenous disadvantage and police brutality.
"We made this album in our community, for our community, from our community," said Briggs, one half of the duo with rapper Trials.
"Change doesn't come from being comfortable," he said.

"We made ourselves extremely uncomfortable making this album, trying to upset all those rednecks.

"Here's a new joint for our mums to put on the shelf," the rapper said when he was handed the award.
The musicians kept punching out the political messages.
All Our Exes Live in Texas snatched the award for Best Blues and Roots album for When We Fall, and lead singer Hannah Crofts took the opportunity to make a statement on the situation on Manus Island.
Crofts painted her nails with a slogan in support of 600 men who were still on the Papua New Guinea island.
"It's about bringing them home," she said.

Amy Shark, 31, whose hit Adore brought her massive chart and radio success, took out awards for Best Pop Release and Breakthrough Artist.
"My heart can't handle this," she said.
The Gold Coast indie star said getting to her "fairytale" 2017 was no walk in the park though.
"For so long there were many people who didn't respond ... my now husband was writing to people, sending my demo.
"I was very close to giving it all away."
New Zealand songstress Lorde, who has been touring Australia to rave reviews, performed a mash up of her hits Liability and Green Light, with her trademark wild dancing captivating the audience.

Kasey Chambers took out Best Country Album for Dragonfly and also the (unofficial) award for most excited recipient.
"Sorry I'm just freaking out," the country princess said.
The album was produced by Paul Kelly, who Chambers called "one of the biggest inspirations of my life".
Chambers also decided to touch on gender equality in the industry, in the same vein as Tina Arena's 2015 statement.
"A lot of negative stuff has been said about being a woman over 40 in the industry … but I f***ing love it!"

Rock icon Darryl Braithwaite, who has had a major resurgence among millennials with his 90s hit The Horses, has been be inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame.
He took the opportunity to reflect on his four-decades-long music career, which started with Sherbet and transformed into a solo career with 12 platinum records.
After Sherbet's break-up Braithwaite went on the dole for a while.
"I then worked on the roads for 10 weeks … it was then I realised I needed to keep making music," he said.
"If you're a young person who has that passion, please listen to the voice inside your head because it's really worth it."
The night built to a climax with Styles performing his latest single Kiwi to the crowd.
Also worth a mention — Jimmy Barnes wore a kilt while accepting his award for Best Children's Album for Och Aye The G'Nu, which is about a Scottish wildebeest.
Bringing his grandson Dylan and Blue Wiggle Anthony Field with him to the stage, he said he enlisted the help of the very best in kids music — The Wiggles — for this album.
"If you're going to make a kids album why not go to the top?"

Telstra's chief executive Andrew Penn said the company's HFC cables worked just fine until the NBN made "technology changes" to them and also admitted the company cannot tell customers how fast their NBN internet will be until after it is connected.

Speaking to The Business presenter Elysse Morgan during an American Chamber of Commerce in Australia (AmCham) lunch, Mr Penn said he supported NBN Co's decision to delay its rollout on the Hybrid Fibre Coaxial (HFC) network by six to nine months while it resolves technical problems leading to internet dropouts.
However, Mr Penn emphasised that those problems were not inherent in the cable, much of which was installed by Telstra.
"That is the same cable that currently provides internet services for Telstra's customers and also for Foxtel pay TV services and for those services it is absolutely fine and delivering a great experience," he said.
"It's in the process of NBN taking it and making whatever technology changes they are making to it where they have some issues."
It is not just HFC that is causing problems for NBN Co and telcos using its network, with several internet service providers compensating customers for slower-than-advertised speeds.

Telstra's boss said his company cannot accurately tell customers how fast their speeds will be until after they are connected.
"NBN cannot advise on what the actual speed is that's available in your home until it actually gets connected," Mr Penn said.
Pressed on how Telstra would advertise speeds to customers, Mr Penn said it promised a baseline and then offered upgraded speeds at an extra cost for customers whose connection could support it.
"Because NBN cannot tell us until they actually connect a home what speed they can provide to that particular home," he explained.
Despite the repeated problems with slower than anticipated internet speeds, dropouts and higher costs, Mr Penn said he did not expect that enough customers would abandon the NBN for mobile connections to make it redundant.
"I think you will see some customers on the fixed network decide to just go mobile only, but ultimately the laws of physics apply, and if you were to carry the same amount of data on a mobile network at a national level that is currently carried on a fixed network there would have to be such a very, very significant investment in mobile capacity," he said.
"There's no doubt that 5G and mobile will play a bigger role, my point is that it won't eliminate the NBN completely.

"It'll probably impact it as a business, because they'll probably ultimately have a smaller proportion of customers that they're serving, but it won't render it redundant completely."
As for the financial impact, Mr Penn said Telstra is still calculating the short-term cost of the latest delay in the NBN rollout and will update the market in the coming days, including whether there would be any further cut to the company's planned dividend.
"Financially, there's net-net no long term change, because this affects the timing of when we receive the various different payments but, as you can imagine, there's quite a lot of complexity in the relationship between NBN and Telstra financially," he said.

The 2017 ARIA Music Awards are underway with local and international talent hitting the red carpet at the Sydney's Star casino.
The music legends nominated could not be more diverse for the ARIA's 31st year, with something for everybody's tastes including Paul Kelly, Amy Shark, A.B Original, Jessica Mauboy and Illy.


And in what is sure to be a big moment, rock icon Daryl Braithwaite, who has had a major resurgence among millennials, will be inducted into the Hall of Fame.
Fans are in for a night of top entertainment with several nominees gracing the stage including Gang of Youths, Peking Duck, Dan Sultan and Pnau.
But from the crowd's reaction on the red carpet, the performances by the international acts, Harry Styles and Lorde, were hotly anticipated.
Styles sidestepped the media area completely, but fans went wild when he arrived just before the awards kick-off.



Indigenous duo A.B Original, who are nominated for six ARIA awards for their album Reclaim Australia, kept their expectations low before the ceremony.
The pair described 2017 as a long year.
"We're Indigenous so one year is like three for us. We've actually lived three years for your one. It's been wild," rapper Briggs said.
The rappers said they thought the album release would mark the end of their careers.
"We thought this was it — we thought we would do this and go out with a bang," Trials said
"We just thought we were going to make the best album rap for us … we didn't think anyone else would enjoy it," Briggs said.

"It feels great to be finally recognised," said indie-pop darling Amy Shark, a nominee today.
"The ARIAs is so special, its something we've watched as children so it's huge to be here.
"I was very close to giving it all away … but it was meant to be. It's been a big big year."

Gang of Youths frontman David Le'aupepe said he was feeling overwhelmed, but unlike last year he was walking the red carpet sober this time.
"Started doing this expecting nothing then here it is!" he said.
"Would be cool to win something."

Bliss n Eso are nominated for best song and best video for their song Moments and described how director Allan Hardy went to eight countries and shot kids in their natural environment.
MC Eso said his son was one of the kids in the video.

Braithwaite, the newest inductee into the Hall of Fame, said he was "honoured" to have been in the music industry for 50 years.
"I remember when Sherbet split and the solo thing came along, and I realised how much work went into it," Braithwaite said.
The singer, who's experienced a resurgence of his 1990s hit song Horses said it was "spooky hanging with all the young people".
"But it's a good responsibility … no plans to stop unless I die."

Pop band Client Liaison arrived in a smoking limousine, with band member and triple j Hack presenter Tom Tilley — who is still recovering from a motocross injury — pushed onto the red carpet in a wheelchair.

The Liberal Party has amped up its campaign against the South Australian Government over power — promising to appoint a "special investigator" on day one of any future Marshall Liberal government, to investigate Labor's early purchase of a power plant.
Premier Jay Weatherill and Energy Minister Tom Koutsantonis this morning exercised an option to purchase nine aero-derivative turbines, which it currently leases from US company APR Energy.
They are meant to provide up to 270 megawatts of backup generation should the state face the risk of blackouts over the next two summers.
The Government plans to take the nine turbines from their temporary diesel configuration at Elizabeth and Lonsdale and connect them at a permanent location, to become a gas-fired backup generator.
Under its contract with APR Energy, the Government was not required to exercise its purchase option until December 2018.
But the Premier said there was no good reason not to make a call before the election.
"This decision is an important decision to take now so we can put in place the planning arrangements, the commissioning arrangements, the selection of site and the preparation of ground works so that we can be in this power plant on the ground by the time of the next summer," Mr Weatherill said.
In a sign of just how politically charged the energy debate has become, the Premier and Energy Minister signed the contract alongside a stack of contracts relating to the privatisation of South Australia's electricity network under then-Liberal treasurer Rob Lucas 17 years ago.

"What was done today is undo some of those signatures that bear Rob Lucas's name ... We undo some of the damage that Rob Lucas did," Mr Koutsantonis told reporters.
The Government has refused to detail the precise costs of leasing and buying the turbines, declaring the figures are "commercial in confidence".
But the Premier said all elements of his $550 million Energy Plan remained within budget.
Minutes before the contract was signed, deputy Liberal leader Vickie Chapman declared a Liberal government would appoint a "special investigator" to examine the decision to purchase the generators.
"If the Premier signs that contract today, on day one of a Marshall government we will commence an inquiry into this scandalous behaviour," Ms Chapman said.
"It's scandalous because the whole process of procurement is in secret."

"To do this in a hurry, to save their own skin on the eve of an election makes it all the more despicable.
"It's a stinking rotten scandal and it is not an acceptable standard of government and it is unacceptable that our grandchildren are left with this legacy."
Ms Chapman was not specific on what form the investigation would take, but raised the prospect of a judicial inquiry with royal commission powers.
"Every person that's involved in this scandal will be called to account with a Marshall Liberal government," she said.
The Premier Jay Weatherill said any such inquiry would be politically motivated.
"If there is to be a judicial inquiry it should be into the privatisation of ETSA," he said.
Ms Chapman was less clear on whether a Marshall Liberal government would seek to privatise the taxpayer-owned power plant.
The Opposition's power plan, released last month, contemplated continuing the temporary lease of the gas turbines, but not proceeding with the permanent purchase of a power plant.
Instead, a Liberal government would contract backup generation from the private sector.
Ms Chapman repeatedly refused to rule out whether that meant a Liberal government would sell the taxpayer-owned turbines.
"The inquiry has to happen first. Obviously we'll be guided by that," she told reporters.
"It may not be enforceable, who knows."
The latest fight over the South Australian Government's generators came as the Australian Energy Market Operator confirmed they might be used to help prevent blackouts in Victoria this Summer.
AEMO's summer readiness plan confirms the operator has used emergency powers to procure 1,150 megawatts of back-up generation and demand-side measures to help alleviate the risk of blackouts across the national grid.

The powers — known as the Reliability and Emergency Reserve Trader (RERT) function — will see AEMO source 884 MW of demand side response, which can be called upon at relatively short notice.
The RERT will also include 266 MW of temporary diesel generation — including 170 megawatts from the South Australian Government's turbines.
The Energy Minister Tom Koutsantonis has confirmed the State Government will be paid if it is called upon by AEMO to turn its generators on.
"We will get paid in the RERT system, but not enough to recover costs and we're not attempting to make profit. We're just helping with the running costs of the generator," he said.
AEMO's report says it is "well prepared" for the summer ahead.
"In South Australia, the State Government's energy plan will be an important contributor to delivering new generation and energy storage for use in emergency situations during the coming summer, if extreme conditions occur," the report said.

The push for a banking commission of inquiry has stalled again, with the Greens toughening their position on a bill being prepared by LNP senator Barry O'Sullivan.

Senator O'Sullivan's bill to set up an inquiry into the banking sector appeared to have enough support to pass both houses after two of his colleagues in the House of Representatives said they would support it.
But the Greens have now said they want the bill to be stronger, and they will not support it if it is introduced to the Senate this week in its current form.
The Greens are still negotiating with Senator O'Sullivan to add extra elements to the bill.
The Federal Opposition has been demanding a royal commission into banking.
But Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull is continuing to resist those calls saying: "We have made it very clear we are not going to establish a royal commission."
Senator O'Sullivan's push for a parliamentary inquiry is aimed at countering Mr Turnbull's resistance to the push for a royal commission.
A vote in Parliament cannot set up a royal commission but it can set up a commission of inquiry with similar powers.
The timing of Senator O'Sullivan's bill is now unclear.
The pressure over a banking inquiry has intensified after LNP backbencher Llew O'Brien said he was prepared to cross the floor to support it.
His LNP colleague George Christensen has already said he would cross the floor.

If they both voted for the bill with Labor and the crossbench, it would pass the Lower House.
Cabinet Minister Christopher Pyne has warned them against their agitation for an inquiry.
Mr Pyne said the Coalition needed to remain united.
"My message to all my colleagues is that disunity is death," Mr Pyne said.
"If anyone thinks they will do well by creating disunity, they don't do so.
"I've been in parliament for a quarter of a century, I can tell you that when parties are disunited they lose."

The surge in bitcoin's price is showing no signs of slowing down, and is within striking distance of the $US10,000 mark.

At 11:05am (AEDT), one bitcoin was worth $US9,733 ($12,793).
The digital currency has seen an eye-watering tenfold increase in its value since the start of the year and has more than doubled in value since the beginning of October.
Bitcoin's price has been helped in recent months by the announcement that the world's biggest derivatives exchange operator CME Group would start offering bitcoin futures.
The company said last week the futures would launch by the end of the year, though no precise date had been set.
So far, institutional investors have largely stayed away from the market, viewing it as a bubble — too volatile, risky and complex to invest other people's money into.
But some say the launch of the CME futures could lure in more mainstream investors.
"Promises of bitcoin futures opening the door to institutional money are supercharging the price," said Charles Hayter, founder of cryptocurrency data analysis website Cryptocompare.

The latest price surge brought bitcoin's market capitalisation — its price multiplied by the number of coins that have been released into the system — to more than $214 billion, according to industry website Coinmarketcap.
Meanwhile, the total estimated value of all cryptocurrencies surged to $401.9 billion.

That was even higher than US retail giant Wal-Mart's market cap by $22.5 billion, which topped the Fortune 500 list of biggest companies in 2017.
The staggering price increases seen in the crypto-market have led to multiple warnings from central bankers, investment bankers and other investors that it had reached bubble territory.
Some say it could prompt regulators in the West to crack down on the market in a similar fashion to China, where bitcoin exchanges were shut down earlier this year.
"Regulators know the rewards of cryptocurrency and blockchain could be huge but [they] have more than one eye on the catastrophic ramifications if good governance, stability and control are not preserved," said David Futter, a fintech partner at law firm Ashurst, in London.
"If the carrot of self-regulation proves insufficient, the regulators will not hesitate to use their stick."
Bitcoin's biggest rival, Ethereum, has seen even more stratospheric gains this year, up more than 6,000 per cent.
Each Ethereum unit is worth $633.41, with its market cap around $60.7 billion.
While the western world is yet to celebrate bitcoin's $US10,000 ($13,150) milestone, the digital currency is worth almost twice as much in Zimbabwe.
Bitcoin in Zimbabwe soared to about $23,659 on the local exchange on Tuesday, as investors continued to seek a safe haven for their money trapped in the banks.
Ousted president Robert Mugabe's 37-year rule left the country with a worthless currency, massive debts, and an estimated unemployment rate of more than 80 per cent.
In the grip of acute shortages of US dollars, Zimbabweans are piling into anything they think might retain value.
In contrast, bitcoin is seen as a volatile and highly speculative bet for most investors around the world, and many countries have dealt with it differently under their laws.
China and South Korea has banned fundraising through token launches (also known as initial coin offerings), whereby a new cryptocurrency is sold to finance a product development.
Russia's central bank said it would block websites selling bitcoin and its rival cryptocurrencies.
The European Central Bank told EU lawmakers last year, "they should not seek … to promote the use of virtual currencies" because these could, "in principle affect the central banks' control over the supply of money" and inflation.
Yet Japan in April recognised bitcoin as legal tender and approved several companies as operators of cryptocurrency exchanges but required them to register with the Government.

The head of Australia's energy market regulator says the organisation has done everything possible to stave off further blackouts this summer, declaring she wants energy policy to become "boring" again.
The Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) faced a blizzard of criticism last summer when power shortages caused mass blackouts in South Australia and put the energy grid in New South Wales under strain.
Since then, the Hazelwood Power Station in Victoria's LaTrobe Valley has also shut down — taking another 1,600 Megawatts of generation capacity out of the system.
But AEMO chief executive Audrey Zibelman said the regulator had built up reserves of energy which could be used to keep the lights on when demand peaked.
"I think we all want to make it better for Australians, we want to get back to the point where energy is boring and nobody is interested because we're doing it so well," Ms Zibelman said.
"We feel like we have solved many of the issues we were concerned about and are very prepared."
She said AEMO could deliver 800 megawatts of additional power from gas generators.

The regulator is also planning to ask big power users and utilities to cut their use of power when demand rises.
AEMO said that would allow them to pump more than 1,000 megawatts of power into the system if needed.

Still, AEMO is not guaranteeing the lights will stay on when temperatures soar.
The operator's summer readiness report said demand could be "precariously tight" if any major power generators are taken offline for maintenance.
And Ms Zibelman conceded the grid could still struggle if bushfires or other natural disasters forced several generators to shut down.
"We can't solve for every potential event … there are always things you can't anticipate and can't control," she said.
"[But] all in all — compared to last summer — we're in a good, strong position."

Australia's risk of a recession has fallen from one-third to about 20 per cent, with home prices only set for high single-digit percentage falls, according to independent economic analyst Gerard Minack.
In April, Mr Minack warned of one-in-three chance Australia would experience a recession in 2018 — its first in 27 years — but now he believes there is just a one-in-five chance the economy will shrink for two consecutive quarters.
Mr Minack told The Business that it is a pick up in business confidence and non-mining investment that is likely to stop Australia's economy going backwards.
"We have seen a significant pick up in business confidence," he said.
"If that's all I had, I wouldn't have changed things much, but we're also seeing corporates deliver on their optimism in terms of the labour market — we've had a cracking six months for hiring.
"And, finally, there's a twinkle in their eye when it comes to business investment."
The latest business investment figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics are due out on Thursday, and the typical forecast is for a 1 per cent rise over the September quarter.
Not that the renowned bear has suddenly turned into a bullish optimist.
"There's still a lot of problems out there, and my base case is still that we've got a year of exceptionally weak, tepid, anaemic growth heading into next year," Mr Minack added.
"But that downside risk, it's still there, but it's not quite as big as I thought it was three or six months ago."
The two biggest handicaps for the Australian economy remain weak wages growth and over-priced housing, according to Mr Minack.
He said there is some chance that rising employment will help the former.

"The best tonic for consumers, rather than capex per se, would be a pick-up in wages which, ultimately on measures we have, are at rock-bottom multi-decade lows, and that also is getting the consumer down," he observed.
On the issue of home prices, Mr Minack remains downbeat, but is not expecting a severe crash.
"My base case for now is it's a high single-digit percentage decline across the board, there'll be a lot of unevenness there but that sort of order of magnitude," he said.
"But then the even bigger uncertainty will be how do people respond to that, because it's obviously been something that's been helpful for sentiment and has encouraged people to spend more of their income than they have historically.
"And if they take fright then we have a recession, if they just get mildly cautious and conservative then that's probably the base case of very weak growth and, of course, if they don't respond at all then we can talk about bright times ahead."
As for the recent global share market rally, Mr Minack said it could have at least another year to run.
"Low volatility, low interest rates, steady inflation and high profitability, we've got them all," he said.
"You could take the view that conditions are as propitious as we've seen them in several decades to get a proper equity bubble.
"Now, by definition, a bubble is not sustainable, but you can't rule out that over the next one or two quarters we see equities put in some great returns building on the strength we've had this year as investors factor in what looks like a fairly cloudless sky on a 12 to 18 month view - cloudless in terms of the risks we can forecast."

However, while Mr Minack has traded his claws for horns over the next year, he remains a bear on the medium-term outlook.
"I don't think it's remarkable we've got an expansion underway globally, I think it's remarkable that it's taken eight or nine years of zero rates to get any growth at all," he said.
"To me it's symptomatic that we still are facing this secular stagnation — this period of low growth, low rates and this current expansion will be, I think, quite temporary."

About 150,000 people will leave their homes on the slopes of Mount Agung, Bali's Governor says, as the volcano's eruptions grow more powerful, while the island's main airport will close for another 24 hours due to ashfall.

Governor Made Pastika said the evacuation period for people living within 10 kilometres of the crater could easily last as long as a month.
Indonesia's disaster management agency said the evacuation is so far orderly and without panic.
Mount Agung has been hurling clouds of white and dark grey ash about 3,000 meters into the atmosphere since the weekend and lava is welling up in the crater, sometimes reflected as a reddish-yellow glow in the ash plumes.

Its explosions can be heard about 12 kilometres away.
Videos released by Indonesia's disaster management agency showed a mudflow of volcanic debris and water — known as a lahar — moving down the volcano's slopes.
It said lahars could increase because it is rainy season and the agency warned people to stay away from rivers.
Spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference in Jakarta that the danger zone affects 22 villages and about 90,000 to 100,000 people.
He said about 40,000 people have evacuated but others have not left because they feel safe or don't want to abandon their livestock.
"Authorities will comb the area to persuade them," he said.
"If needed we will forcibly evacuate them."
About 25,000 people were already living in evacuation centres after an increase in tremors from the mountain in September sparked an evacuation.
Lava rising in the crater "will certainly spill over to the slopes," Mr Sutopo said.
However life continued largely as normal in villages surrounding Agung on Tuesday, with residents setting up traditional markets and offering prayers as the volcano continued to spew tall columns of ash and smoke from its crater.
Mount Agung's last eruption in 1963 killed more than 1,000 people and razed several villages by hurling out pyroclastic material, hot ash, lava and lahar.
Indonesia's Volcanology and Geological Disaster Mitigation Centre warned that if a similar eruption occurred, it could send rocks bigger than fist-size up to 8 kilometres from the summit and volcanic gas a distance of 10 kilometres within three minutes.
Bali's Ngurah Rai airport will be closed for a further 24 hours, after being closed on Monday morning due to falling volcanic ash.
The airport said it will reassess the situation on Wednesday morning.
A report from local aviation navigation authorities showed that "aircraft flight channels are covered with volcanic ash", the transportation ministry said in a statement.


Airport spokesman Air Ahsanurrohim said 445 flights were cancelled on Monday, stranding about 59,000 travellers.
Another 30,000 passengers will be unable to leave via plane after today's closure.

Ten alternative airports have been prepared for airlines to divert inbound flights, including in neighbouring provinces.
The airport's closure is having a disruptive effect on flights around Indonesia and the region.
Bali is a hub airport in Indonesia with many flights transiting there for domestic as well as international destinations.
Planes that would have flown other routes on Monday were stuck on the tarmac in Bali.
Human Rights Watch Indonesia researcher Andreas Harsono said he was waiting for two hours at Jakarta's terminal 3 for his delayed flight to a domestic destination.
He said other flight delays had been announced at the terminal, which serves national carrier Garuda, and the departure area was filling up with many waiting passengers.
Indonesia's Directorate General of Land Transportation said 100 buses were being deployed to Bali's international airport and to ferry terminals to help travellers stranded by the eruption.

The agency's chief said major ferry crossing points had been advised to prepare for a surge in passengers and vehicles.
About 500 passengers have so far moved on to airports on the island of Java, but most are remaining on Bali and hoping the airport will resume operations.
Indonesia's Tourism Ministry said member hotels of the Indonesia Hotel and Restaurant Association would provide a night's free accommodation to people affected by the airport closure.

The ABC's board will be asked to reconsider triple j's decision to move the date of its highly successful Hottest 100 countdown away from Australia Day, according to the Communications Minister.

The scheduling change was announced yesterday and has caused significant brouhaha among politicians, with some criticising the ABC for seeking to "delegitimise" Australia Day.
Triple j management argue the Hottest 100 was not created as an Australia Day celebration, and it had consulted with its audience, the music industry and Indigenous Australians about whether changing the date was necessary.
"There are a relatively small number of people who have an issue with the fact that Australia Day is celebrated on January 26," Communications Minister Mitch Fifield told News Breakfast.
"I already have made my view clear to the ABC.
"And I'll be asking the board of the ABC, who have the ultimate programming and editorial responsibility, to reconsider this."
A statement from the ABC board published this morning said the decision to move the date of the countdown would "benefit everyone".
"Triple j's community continues to celebrate the countdown and the great music, now over an extended weekend, while the network has more time to join the rest of the ABC in providing comprehensive coverage of Australia Day," the statement said.
"Its 2018 program includes an interview with the Young Australian of the Year, and crosses to other Australia Day activities, including Indigenous events like Yabun."

The station's announcement yesterday included its special programming plans for Australia Day 2018. It will broadcast Australian artists all day and feature events including citizenship ceremonies and the Australia v England One Day International cricket series.
Mr Fifield initially said he was "bewildered" by yesterday's announcement.
"The ABC shouldn't be buying into this debate," he said in a statement.
"Australia Day is our national day. The ABC should honour it and not mess with the Hottest 100."

Fellow Liberal MP Alex Hawke also shared his disappointment on the decision in an interview with the radio station's news and current affairs program, Hack.
"It's hard to see how it can't be interpreted as a little bit political," he said.
"There has been this conversation started by some protest groups about Australia Day being held on January 26, and there's no real clear reason why we need to move the Hottest 100 away from January 26, Australia Day.
"I don't understand it. I think the Government doesn't understand it.
"The Government's view is that Australia Day should continue to be held on January 26 and it's an appropriate day to mark the good things about our history and the things that aren't so good about our history."

A number of signs are pointing to the Australian share market opening lower today.

The price of key commodities, iron ore and copper, fell by 0.9 per cent each overnight.
Global markets are providing a weak lead, with Wall Street ending its day with a lacklustre performance.
The US market hit record highs in early trade, driven by a surge in Cyber Monday online retail sales.
Amazon saw a 0 per cent rise in its share price after data from Adobe Analytics showed the retailer's Black Friday online sales rose nearly 17 per cent from last year.
But Wall Street has since retreated from those highs.
Telecommunications and utilities were the sectors which posted the highest gains — both rising by 0.6 per cent each.
Most S&P sectors traded flat, while the energy sector was the worst performer — falling by more than 1 per cent.
Chevron and Exxon Mobil shares slipped by 0.8 and 0.4 per cent respectively.
The drop in energy stocks was due to a fall in US oil prices, amid concerns about the outcome of the OPEC meeting later this week.
At this meeting, the world's largest oil producers and Russia will discuss a potential extension of production cuts to curb a global supply glut.
ASX futures have fallen by 0.2 per cent, which is another sign of a lower open for the local share market.
Although there has been a drop in commodity prices, gold was the exception — lifting by 0.5 per cent to $US1,294.
The Australian dollar is weaker against the US dollar (-0.1 per cent), Japanese yen (-0.6 per cent) and New Zealand dollar (-0.5 per cent).
But the local currency strengthened against the British pound (+0.1 per cent) and euro (+0.3 per cent).

A tourism development proposed for Cleland Wildlife Park is just "pre-election glitter" and would destroy the natural aesthetic of the Adelaide Hills, a former state MP who opposed a cable car plan in the area nearly 30 years ago has said.
The State Government has released concept plans for the wildlife park and is now searching for investors to make it a reality.
The plans were designed by businessman Allan Zeman, who is known for turning Hong Kong's Ocean Park into a bigger success than Hong Kong's Disneyland.
"We're excited by it and we want to see whether others are similarly excited by it," Premier Jay Weatherill said while unveiling the plans on Monday.
Former Democrats MP Ian Gilfillan was a vocal opponent of a proposal for a cable car in the same area in 1989.
That proposal was eventually rejected by State Cabinet under the leadership of then-premier John Bannon.

Mr Gilfillan said Mr Zeman's ideas — which included a cable car, hotel, zip lines and an Australiana shopping precinct — should be rejected.
"A cable car [in particular] … in the crest of the hills will be nothing other than a constant irritant and an eyesore to anyone who is appreciating the view from Adelaide, looking at that lovely range," he said.
"Cable cars are a dime a dozen all over the world, but unspoiled hill faces as Adelaide's got … are unique."
He said it would create a negative impact on both flora and fauna, including the natural movement of birds and smaller animals.
"It wouldn't have any attraction from anyone who really cares about wildlife," Mr Gilfillan said.
"It seems to me that it's a bit more like pre-election glitter than a serious proposal, and I hope it doesn't get any further," he said.
Mr Weatherill, in revealing the concept plan, said the proposal would be approached in a sensitive and consultative manner.
Australian businessman Lindsay Fox, a friend of Mr Zeman, yesterday said he was considering investing in the proposal but wanted to see more detail.
The state election is scheduled for March next year.

The union representing teachers in Tasmania has been accused of bullying staff, acting in an anti-union fashion and creating a culture of mistrust.
The ABC has obtained a letter that was sent to about 50 Australian Education Union (AEU) councillors on behalf of staff who are represented by the Australian Services Union (ASU).
The AEU in Tasmania represents about 6,000 education workers, and is headed by Roz Madsen, who is also the president of Unions Tasmania.
The damning letter outlines questionable redundancies and the disregard of an existing staff agreement as the union undergoes a restructure.
The ABC understands almost a quarter of the 21 AEU staff are on stress-related leave or have made workers compensation claims.
"We are informed that over a long period some employees perceive or believe that they have been subjected to bullying," the letter reads.
"We believe that the recent changes that are being made under the restructure are not in line with union values and beliefs."
The letter claims that under the restructure, some workers had been made redundant only to be replaced by contract workers.
It said the ASU is of the view that the AEU is "unreasonably disregarding" clauses in an existing staff agreement, while a new agreement is negotiated.
Negotiations have been going for 12 months, unsuccessfully.
"We are not against the changes being made to the AEU … however the resulting outcomes for some of your AEU staff has been disappointing, with many people being unfairly disadvantaged and treated without due regard to reasonable union values and industrial relations procedures," the letter reads.
The ASU, which represents most of the staff, claims employees who hold permanent positions have been told they will need to apply for new fixed-term contract roles or that they no longer have a job and will be made redundant.
"Is this ethical or moral for a union organisation to behave in this way towards their employees?" the letter asks.
"The mental health and wellbeing of some staff has been affected, which has resulted in two employees claiming workers compensation and others having to take sick leave due to the stressful situation that they have found themselves in."
In a statement, AEU Tasmania state manager Roz Madsen said the union had "undergone some changes in order to better serve the interests of Tasmania's hard working teachers, principals and support staff in our public schools and TAFE".
"Our focus now is on securing the additional staff and other supports that are urgently needed in our schools and TAFE to ensure a quality education for all," Ms Madsen said.

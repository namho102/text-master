The Seven Network has faced an enormous online backlash following 7.30's story about the Seven Network cadet who was dismissed soon after making a complaint about sexual harassment.
Today Seven admitted its handling of its meeting with the cadet could have been better.
7.30 aired an audio recording of the meeting between Seven cadet Amy Taeuber and Seven management where she was accused of bullying and suspended from work.
The audience response was swift.



On Tuesday afternoon Seven's share price dropped three cents to 66 cents.
"It's barely even worth a billion dollars now, the whole company," shareholder activist Stephen Mayne said.
"They bought Channel Seven and the magazine business for $4 billion only five or six years ago.
"It's been a financial disaster for the shareholders and the culture is clearly, clearly quite toxic, particularly on these gender issues."
A number of current and former Seven Network staff have contacted 7.30 to say they've had similar experiences to Ms Taeuber.
They refused to speak publicly, saying it was too hard to take on an organisation like Seven.

Sam Mostyn, the AFL's first female commissioner, served on the board of the Sydney Swans with Seven's CEO Tim Worner and is an outspoken advocate for gender equity at the top of the corporate tree.

"Increasingly, whether through shareholders or through customer-buying decisions, we're seeing the public making a decision about the companies they want to support and if we just look at the investor point of view, this is where we'll see the big changes," she said.
"It's been a particularly Australian phenomenon, I think, the boys' club. Those with privilege can't see it. It's invisible to them. And so the more we break down those organisations that have a lot of privilege held by one gender, the greater the chance we have to build really great organisations that value the talent and potential of everyone."
The Australian Institute of Company Directors released a report today and found Seven West Media was one of 64 of the 200 top companies listed on the Australian Stock Exchange with only one woman on their boards.
Former board member and corporate lawyer Sheila McGregor resigned from Seven's board earlier this year during its handling of the Amber Harrison affair with Mr Worner.
"I think both where young people, men and women, look up to their executives to the board and see, for example, no Asian faces or no women, the message to them is, 'I probably don't fit in here and I can, I need to move to make my career somewhere else,'" Ms McGregor told 7.30.
"The board and the executive are really crucial in setting the tone, the culture of the organisation. Not just setting it, but enforcing it when something goes wrong."

Seven issued a statement this afternoon.
"The program broadcast on 7.30 on Monday night … was neither accurate nor balanced," the statement read.
"Amy was not sacked because she made a complaint.
"The termination of employment was made pursuant to a breach of contract. This did not occur during the recorded conversation broadcast by the ABC last night, but many weeks afterwards following meetings and discussions when the former employee was represented by two successive firms of lawyers and the union.
"There is no doubt the initial meeting could have been handled better."


A digital payment app called Afterpay has been growing increasingly popular amongst millennial shoppers and big-name retailers.

Its offering has been described as "modern day lay-by" — except customers can take home their goods immediately, instead of having to wait until all their instalments have been repaid.
But consumer advocates have warned that Afterpay promotes irresponsible spending with its "Shop now, take now, [re]pay it in four [instalments]" proposition.
All of this is happening in an environment where the retail industry is struggling to boost sales, and Australian consumers are trying to pay off record levels of household debt.
Afterpay is an ASX-listed company formed in 2014 by Nick Molnar and Anthony Eisen, its managing director and executive chairman respectively.
73 per cent of its customer base is millennials, people aged between 17 and 37 (those born between 1980 and 2000).
It claims to have more than 1 million users, and 7,500 retailers which offer its payment platform online or in-store — including Myer, Country Road, Kathmandu, Toys 'R' Us and many female fashion brands.
The company's biggest endorsement to date comes from Jetstar.  The low-cost airline began allowing customers to book flights using the new digital payment system last week.
Retailers pay Afterpay, on average, a 4 per cent commission (plus 30 cents) for each transaction processed through the payment platform. This could be a small price to pay if it lifts sales.
Mr Eisen said, "Afterpay is a service for customers to allow them to buy life's little luxuries and necessities, and spread their payments over time in four payments."
For example, like a credit card, the customer can purchase a $100 jacket and take it home without needing to pay anything on the day.
But similar to lay-by, the customer would need to repay Afterpay in four instalments of $25 every fortnight over eight weeks.
The company does not charge fees as long as the customer makes all four repayments on-time.
Mr Eisen also promotes his company's proposition as a win-win for both retailers and consumers.
"Afterpay takes on all of the risk that the customer may not pay us back in the future. So from a retailer's perspective, it's risk-free."
However, it is not as "risk-free" for consumers who default on their payments.
Afterpay's revenue from late fees has risen by 4 per cent since last year.
"Eighty per cent of their $22.9 million revenue we saw in the last financial report comes from retailers," said the Retail Doctor Group's chief executive Brian Walker.
"And 20 per cent comes from customers that are unable to meet the payment in that four-stage cycle."
Missing a repayment instalment attracts an initial $10 penalty.
Furthermore, Afterpay charges customers a further $7 late fee if that instalment remains outstanding after one week.
So a customer who misses all four instalments is subject to a total late fee of $68 for each transaction.
In practical terms, a customer who misses all payments on a $400 jacket would need to pay a maximum late fee of $68 — which works out to be 17 per cent of the purchase price.
But if a customer were to buy four shirts — in four separate transactions — at $100 each, the maximum late fee would be $272, which is 68 per cent of the purchase price.
On average, credit cards charge a 20 per cent interest rate for outstanding balances.
Mr Eisen, however, said his company makes every effort to prevent customers from having to make hefty repayments.
He stressed that most of Afterpay's income is made from the fees it charges retailers for using the payment systems.
Also, if customers are late with payments, the Afterpay app prevents customers from making any further purchases, he explained.
"Before a payment is due, we communicate very strongly with the customer with SMS to remind them to have sufficient money in their account.
"To the extent the customer doesn't have the funds in their account, we'll notify them straight away.
"And in every situation, we'll waive the late fee at that point — if they're able to remediate that position in a short amount of time."
Consumer advocates are expecting to see more people come to them with debt issues related to Afterpay.
"There is a risk of services like Afterpay leading people to having more debt than they can handle," said the Consumer Action Law Centre's senior policy officer Katherine Temple.
"These businesses aren't required to do any form of responsible lending checks."
Afterpay approves customers' purchases "instantly", a promise which features prominently on its promotional materials.
"Considering the approval process is pretty much instant, there doesn't seem like there's any in-depth assessment of whether someone can make repayments without having serious financial hardship," Ms Temple said.
Afterpay claims it is not a credit product, as it does not charge customers an interest rate for late payments.
As a consequence, Ms Temple said it appears the company is not covered by provisions of the National Credit Code which require credit card providers and other lenders to discharge "responsible lending obligations" — which require credit and affordability checks to be conducted on borrowers.
"Another potential loophole they're taking advantage of is exemptions around short-term credit [of] less than 62 days," she said.
Afterpay's schedule of repayments across four fortnights equates to 58 days — which is four days short of that 62-day period.
So far, retailers are have been enthusiastic about Afterpay's product, which is also useful for customers who understand the risks and are good at budgeting.
"It's all about buyer beware," Mr Walker warned.
"We would always counsel any consumer to have the wherewithal to meet the obligations of their purchase."
Otherwise, they may get more than they bargained for.


The ANZ has told its brokers to tighten lending restrictions in 11 postcodes in Brisbane and Perth, where buyers will now need a 20 per cent deposit before they can borrow.
The bank said it would restrict owner-occupier and investment lending to a maximum of 80 per cent of the value of apartments in seven suburbs across Brisbane — including the trendy inner-city Spring Hill, Petrie Terrace and the CBD, where new apartment blocks have sprung up.
Meanwhile, buyers in the Perth CBD, East Perth, South Perth, Kensington, Belmont, Ascot and Redcliffe will need the same amount.
ANZ has also released guidance to brokers on how best to accurately assess clients' financial situation, including keeping a record of their conversations.
An ANZ spokesman said the update was for a handful of Brisbane and Perth locations and was "part of their ongoing efforts to ensure we are lending responsibly and in consideration of all our regulatory responsibilities".
"We regularly look at a number of factors in relation to residential apartments to make sure we are meeting our responsibilities including, supply and demand, rental yield, vacancy rates and location," the spokesman said.
Banking and Finance Consumers Support Association president Denise Brailey warned the big four banks were scrapping some unpopular fees and cracking down on home loan applications as a last-minute attempt to win public support and stave off a Royal Commission.

On Sunday, the Commonwealth Bank announced it was scrapping fees for customers using other bank's ATM machines.
That decision was quickly followed by the ANZ, Westpac and NAB.
Ms Brailey has long accused the banks of committing widespread mortgage fraud to increase profits by deliberately targeting vulnerable people in the community.
These include pensioners the banks dubbed ARIP customers — or asset rich and income poor.
Ms Brailey said she had more than 2,000 low income people on her books that had lost or faced losing their homes after being "preyed on by banks" and granted loans they could not afford.
"I have seen 70 and 80-year-olds on incomes of $30,000 a year given million dollar loans. It is just a disgrace," she said.
"These are not isolated incidents, every case I've looked at has got fraud, some of them have got forgery, but they are all unaffordable, unstainable, unverified loans.
"In some cases, the elderly customers were paying the interest on their loans with the bank's money."
Meanwhile, a major forecasting firm said a boom had resulted in an oversupply of dwellings in Queensland, WA, SA, the NT and the ACT.
BIS Oxford Economics also predicted a slump in house prices and building construction in Perth was set to continue for at least another 18 months.
BIS Oxford Economics managing director Robert Mellor said the oversupply of detatched dwellings had seen house prices fall 13 per cent in Perth in the past two years, to levels not seen since 2007.


Australia's data-gathering capability has been significantly boosted by a multi-million-dollar deal allowing the CSIRO to access a powerful British satellite.
The national science research organisation has reached an agreement with a UK-based firm to use its NovaSAR satellite to capture images of the earth and sea.
Under the $10.45 million, seven-year deal, CSIRO will be granted partial control of the satellite, which will be launched later this year.
Principal research scientist Dr Alex Held said the CSIRO would have access to "10 per cent of the total amount of imagery it can collect on a daily basis".
"We can basically turn on the camera or turn it off as it flies over and collect the amount of data we want," he said.
Dr Held said it was the first time the CSIRO would have access to such a capability, and there would also be emergency applications.
"In disaster situations we need to map the damage of, say, cyclones on crops," he said.

"We have a computer terminal sitting in Australia and we can basically program the satellite from here through the British operations centre to collect data anywhere we want around the world, with highest priority over our region."
The announcement was made at the week-long International Astronautical Congress in Adelaide.
Dr Held said the deal with Surrey Satellite Technology would also allow for tasks such as detecting illegal shipping and deforestation.
According to Industry Minister Arthur Sinodinos, Australia was one of the "largest users" of data gathered in space.
But previously, the CSIRO has only had access to satellite imagery that has been collected by other agencies.
The "SAR" element of NovaSAR stands for Synthetic Aperture Radar — a technology that, according to Dr Held, is able to pick up wavelengths of light invisible to the human eye.


Internet connections on new developments should be ready before occupancy, a federal Labor politician says, adding internet providers and local governments could face "heavy-handed" federal regulation to protect home buyers.

MP Stephen Jones, who sits on the NBN Joint Standing Parliamentary Committee, said he had had many constituents who moved into a newly developed home or business but were left "in limbo" without a connection for months.
"The default position should be that developers should have communication services connected to a property before it is sold," Mr Jones said.
"I'm calling on the industry and calling on local governments to get the issue resolved so that we don't have to put in place what they might see as heavy-handed federal regulation."
"You can't get an occupancy certificate for a residential premises or a business premises unless there is power and water connected — I think we need to look at telecommunications in exactly the same way."
Rather than causing delays or added costs to development, Mr Jones said installing the necessary telecommunications infrastructure during construction was the "most efficient" approach.
Mittagong resident Robert James, one of Mr Jones's constituents, had been forced to use a mobile internet device after moving into his house on a small cul-de-sac development more than five months ago.

"It's quite a slow technology compared to the direct-connected system, [but] it was the only way we could get any internet at all," Mr James said.
Documents seen by the ABC showed the property developer had organised Telstra to install the necessary internet infrastructure, but the telco reneged because the area was due to be connected to the NBN and the infrastructure would therefore become the responsibility of NBN Co.
Mr James thought getting a connection would be straightforward, particularly as his neighbour had recently been connected after filing a complaint. But when he called NBN Co they told him his property was "lost".
"They've lost the address — they knew nothing about the cabling, they knew nothing about the address.
"It's very frustrating, we are living in this little world of our own here," Mr James said.
NBN Co told the ABC it would send a technician the following week, but Mr James said that had still not happened.
"When we purchased the land, it was supposed to be all services; to me all services is telecommunications."
Under current laws, Telstra is responsible for installing telecommunications infrastructure on developments that contain fewer than 100 properties, whereas NBN Co is responsible for larger developments.

But NBN Co would take control away from Telstra if an area was being connected to the NBN network. This could cause complications and delays for new developments lacking the necessary infrastructure.
To simplify the process, the Federal Government introduced legislation to make NBN Co responsible to connect internet infrastructure to all new developments.
But the legislation did not impose any deadlines and the Department of Communications said approvals for occupancy remained the responsibility of local and state agencies.
The Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman is powerless in resolving internet outages where "no infrastructure" is the cause.
Consumer groups said changing the way internet was connected to new homes was well overdue.
"Right now, broadband services are just as essential as water and electricity," Teresa Corbin from the Australian Communications Consumer Action Network said.
"People need to have access to broadband and there shouldn't be any delays in that provision, particularly if it is a new building. We've known for some time there's been planning put in place."
ACCAN is calling on property owners to get "in writing" what internet connections would be available at the time of occupancy.
It's a dilemma that affected Perth apartment owner Kirby Bonavita, who was unable to postpone her home payments after discovering it would not be internet-ready at the time of occupancy.
"We approached the company selling the property and asked if we were able to delay the signing and mortgage," Ms Bonavita said.
"They said as per the legal contract that having the internet isn't actually a necessity on moving in, so, we had to keep going on with the process and move in without internet."
"I definitely assumed that internet would be something that, in today's age, is a necessity."
Ms Bonavita's home is not scheduled to be connected to the NBN until August 2018.
She approached multiple telcos about getting connected, and had been met with various responses about why her property could not access internet.
"As soon as you ask for anything in writing they literally vanish," Ms Bonavita said.
"I am of the impression that they're stalling until the NBN is at least close enough to be ready."
A spokesman for Telstra said the company does, "not intentionally delay connections to our infrastructure".
"Telstra treats all connection requests equally, irrespective of which provider is delivering an internet service."


New polling shows 81 per cent of people in Tasmanian Premier Will Hodgman's electorate want to see pokies either reduced in number or removed altogether.

The ReachTell Poll comes as a State Government inquiry investigates the future of the local gaming industry.
The grassroots campaign has been inspired by stories of Tasmanians damaged by poker machine addiction — people like Karyn, whose first flutter on the pokies 20 years ago lead to serious problems.
"It could be half an hour and you've gone through the rent money, the grocery money," she said.
"You feel like such a bad person when you have done the wrong thing with the money.
"And you do illegal things. You do think of suicide, I did."

Karyn is now getting help for her addiction from Relationships Australia.
"We're looking at [removing poker machines from pubs and clubs] as being necessary because of what our clients tell us," Jules Carrol from Relationships Australia said.
"They tell us if poker machines were not in pubs and clubs it would make it much easier for them to address their problems and to avoid them altogether."
Community groups have previously argued that removing poker machines would also have economic benefits.
Unlike other states, all of the poker machines in Tasmania are owned by one company, The Federal Group.

The company maintains good measures are in place to protect problem gamblers.
"We think problem gambling is always of concern to Tasmanians, but we've got to remember that it's half of 1 per cent of the adult population at the last social and economic impact study, so we think gambling and gaming has been introduced very responsibly," Daniel Hanna from Federal said.
The State Government has said it wants to end The Federal Group's gaming monopoly and reduce the number of poker machines allowed in the state by 150, but the machines already in place would remain.
The Tasmanian Hospitality Association and The Federal Group have put forward a plan that would see pubs and clubs own the poker machines, similar to what is done in other states and territories.
"It would provide certainty for those hotels and clubs that have already got gaming machines and have made significant investments in their facilities over the years," Mr Hanna said.

The Labor Opposition won't release a policy on poker machines until the Government inquiry hands down its report, despite having an MP on the six-person committee conducting the investigation.
If Labor backs the community campaign to remove poker machines from pubs and clubs it would be the first major party in the country to take that position and it would likely become an election issue when the state heads to the polls in March.
Mr Hanna said unprompted poker machines did not register as a key election issue for voters.
"Tasmanians are most concerned about issues like unemployment, about having a strong economy, about having a good health system and education system and feeling safe in their homes and in the street," he said.
The Tasmanian Hospitality Association has committed to campaign against Labor if it calls for a roll back, warning that it could lead to job losses.
Naiche Watson, the licensee of the Campbell Town Hotel, said his 20 poker machines bring in around $800 a week and are an important part of the business.

He is worried removing them could force the pub to close.
"It would be devastating for me and my family and everyone concerned and especially the local community," he said.
Mr Watson took over the license from his step-father Gary Whitney a few months ago.
"Where does it end? Once the pokies are gone, who knows, the TAB could go, something else could go — Keno could go and then the pub's gone. That's it. A town needs a hotel," Mr Whitney said.
But not all hotels agree — several Tasmanian pubs that don't have poker machines have joined the calls for a roll back.
The Australia Institute commissioned the ReachTell Poll of more than 700 people in the electorate of Franklin this month on the issue of poker machines.
"Just over 80 per cent of voters in Franklin either wanted to reduce or completely phase out poker machines," the institute's Leanne Minshull told 7.30.
"And of those people there were 73 per cent of Liberal supporters, so the premier's own base want to see a change in policy on poker machines."

The polling showed 40 per cent of people wanted to see poker machines removed, while a further 41 per cent wanted a reduction in the number of machines.
"Pokies are a legitimate form of entertainment for many Tasmanians who gamble responsibly that help support many small pubs and clubs around the State," a spokesman from the State Government said.
"We won't be banning them."
The Government did acknowledge that problem gambling was an issue for some people but said it would be introducing a public interest test for new venues requesting poker machines.


The Federal Government's budget bottom line has improved by $4.4 billion thanks to improving employment figures and declining welfare and disability support payments.
Treasurer Scott Morrison announced a $37.6 billion deficit when he delivered the budget in May, but this has now been revised to $33.2 billion.
Revenue was $4.1 billion higher than expected and payments were $1.2 billion less than forecast.
Mr Morrison said 250,000 jobs were created during 2016-17, which meant fewer people were dependent on financial support from the Government.
"The biggest contributor to what we've been able to achieve on the spending side has been a reduction of payments on social services of more than $5 billion," Mr Morrison said.
The sluggish roll-out of the National Disability Insurance Scheme has also improved the budget position, with fewer payments made to those in need of assistance.
Spending on natural disaster relief was also lower than expected, despite the destruction of Cyclone Debbie and widespread flooding earlier this year.
The Government spent less on the management of "illegal maritime arrivals", which also reduced the cost of onshore immigration detention and compliance.

The Future Fund, which was established in 2016 to meet $140 billion in public sector superannuation liabilities by 2020, earned $860 million more than expected.
Mr Morrison said the Government remained committed to returning the budget to surplus in 2021, as outlined in the budget papers.
"These are figures for the year that has just finished so the mid-year update will provide updates on what we believe is occurring for this financial year and over the forward estimates," Mr Morrison said.
Labor's finance spokesman Jim Chalmers said the improvements were "expected" and "minor" and based more on good luck than economic management.
"We still have debt and deficit higher than inherited by the Government," Mr Chalmers said.
"Scott Morrison and Mathias Cormann expect a pat on the back for a budget outcome today that is more about good luck than good policy."


Tony Seba, Stanford lecturer, author and self-described thought leader, is not one to prognosticate lightly.
Seba — a "chief disruptor" with over 20 years experience in venture capital, business entrepreneurship and clean energy technologies — has a message for commuters tired of traffic jams.
"We are on the cusp of the fastest, deepest disruption in transportation history," he says.
Seba predicts that by 2024, the whole concept of individually owned cars will be obsolete. The internal combustion engine will cease to be competitive with electric motors.
Car dealerships will cease to exist. Global demand for oil will plummet, and so will its price. And by 2030, 95 per cent of US auto miles will be travelled by autonomous, on-demand electric vehicles.
The automotive and oil industries as we now know them will collapse.

Seba calls this new paradigm Transport as a Service, or TAAS. Essentially, you're going to use the car like you do today, but, as with existing ride-hailing or car-sharing services, vehicles will be booked or hailed through an app.
Cost-conscious consumers will be able to carpool, halving or quartering their transport costs.
And he predicts that this shift — from ownership to access — will be quite orderly as revolutions go.

History is littered with examples of innovations not catching on despite technological superiority or greater utility.
The Iron Age had functioning water mills, Da Vinci the helicopter, Nikolai Tesla his direct current motor, Toshiba the HD DVD.
For Seba, the advent of the autonomous electric vehicle has an edge that these did not: it is drastically cheaper.
"Every time in history where a new product or service has been equivalent to the incumbent [but] has been 10 times cheaper, there has been a disruption. Every single time," he says.
A Toyota Corolla costs about an eighth of the amount of a Tesla Model S, but thinking in terms of one-off purchases is irrelevant to TAAS: for a fleet of autonomous vehicles the key factors are cost per kilometre travelled and lifetime of post-sale use.
In the RethinkX model, efficiencies in battery storage and the viability of vehicle artificial intelligence are assumed, and leave the customers of the near future with a clear decision.
The average American household spends $10,000 on car upkeep per year — a figure Seba reckons would be cut by 90 per cent under TAAS.
"People love cars — but those same people love money more," Seba says.
South Perth, Darwin and New South Wales, have all trialled or started trials of autonomous vehicles.
"It's a space where we should be competitive," Travis Waller, director of the Research Centre for Integrated Transport Innovation at the University of New South Wales, says.
"Google Maps started here. The software that runs signalised intersections was designed here in the 70s."

Professor Waller also believes the TAAS model is coming, though he's doubtful about Seba's world-changing timeframe. Most manufacturers, he says, are targeting 2025 for autonomous deployment.
"They're looking more at campus environments, or airports," Professor Waller says.
Well-mapped environments, in other words, with relatively low traffic loads.
"But completely autonomous, and completely functional," he says.
Autonomous systems still struggle with irregular interactions — such as cyclists — and Professor Waller suggests they're likely to be deployed in a more limited capacity, at least at first.
"Probably the place where we'll see autonomous take off first is long haul freight," he says.
But he thinks on thing we're likely to start seeing autonomous-only lanes soon, so that drivers are introduced to the concept.
"Even if there is no safety or risk, we have to deal with perception and people's comfort," he says.
At a certain point in Australian history, not owning a car would have seemed as unthinkable as not producing one.
But for Mike Ramsay, a research director at technology research firm Gartner, owning a car has never really made sense.
"In Sydney or in New York, or in San Francisco, or in Tokyo — owning an automobile is really not even logical if you're in certain areas of those cities," he says.
There's public transport, for one thing. Parking is expensive and rare.
But Mr Ramsay is not convinced by the prospect of a revolution within the next decade.
"I think all things in automotive move glacially," he says.

There are cultural barriers to the uptake of autonomous vehicles — in a recent Gartner survey, some 55 per cent of respondents said they would not ride in an autonomous vehicle.
Most said they would ride in a semi-autonomous vehicle, provided there was a manual override function.
Mr Ramsey laughs at the problem this poses for a computer interface.
"How many times have you been in a cab where you've said to the driver, 'Just drop me off here, not to the destination'," he asks.
"Can you communicate that to a robot?"
Mr Ramsay believes the next five years will be a slow march, where cars gradually come to resemble "rolling mobile phones".
Facets of autonomous technology — diagnosing engine problems, rerouting through traffic, guided reverse parking — will become standard.
The internal combustion engine is on its way out — though Mr Ramsey gives it 30 to 40 years, rather than Seba's estimate of five.
The biggest question — one that Seba's model is quiet on — is who will manufacture the vehicles.

Tesla may have a charismatic leader with an unlimited tolerance for risk — but they sold some 80,000 cars in 2016, compared to the 10 million of Toyota or Volkswagen.
"Will Google buy one of these companies?" Mr Ramsay asks.
"So far, [Google] have been hesitant to do that, but if the technology is good enough and there's a demand that's strong enough they may change their mind."
There's a slide that Seba likes to start his lectures with: a black and white photo of an Easter parade on Fifth Avenue in New York City.
The year is 1900, and the scene is flush with suited revellers. What's most striking is what isn't there: cars. Instead, the avenue is filled with horses.
In a few short years — and to the disbelief of many — the Model T Ford went into production and livestock became a rarity in the city.
"The same things were said back then that are now being said about cars," Seba says.


The Federal Government might be forced to intervene with quotas to force companies to get more women directors into boardrooms, a powerful business lobby group has warned.
While reluctant to back quotas to mandate gender diversity, Australian Institute of Company Directors (AICD) chairman Elizabeth Proust concedes it might be the last resort in the battle to get even with the blokes' club in corporate Australia.
"Quotas are not on the table for now, but clearly all options will need to be considered," Ms Proust told AM.
"If we're not able to see genuinely diverse boards, then governments are likely to take action."

Ms Proust said she was reluctant to support quotas because there are often "unintended consequences, so you need to be careful about what you wish for".
The AICD says its quest for 30 per cent female representation across ASX 200 boards by 2018 has stalled.
The institute's latest gender diversity report shows that, as of August 31, there were 25.4 per cent female directors — only marginally higher than the 25.3 per cent reached at the end of 2016.
At the time of publishing, 11 ASX 200 companies had no women on their boards.
The study also outs 64 companies that only have one female director, including 10 companies where a sole female director has been in place for more than three years.

Ms Proust said it is possible that some employers believe they have done enough in checking the diversity box and that gender diversity may have hit a new kind of "glass ceiling".
She slammed male-dominated companies resistant to change who made poor excuses about the difficulty in turning gender diversity policies into reality.
Some are almost representative of the dinosaur age where they say there are not enough qualified women or women aren't flexible enough," Ms Proust said.
"We also hear that women have to look after the children — that's still being said in this day and age.
"They're very average excuses, and they're just that — excuses."
Ms Proust believes the approaching season of annual general meetings will be closely watched after the Australian Council of Superannuation Investors (ACSI) flagged a plan to use its voting power to warn boards to deliver on gender diversity promises.

"[The ACSI] will be voting against companies which are not making progress towards gender diversity," she said.
"Every board is on notice that ACSI will be voting against directors' election, against remuneration reports, and I think that should be a significant wake-up call to boards."
The HESTA industry superannuation fund said it will make a protest vote against the reappointment of a male director at the Australian Agriculture Company (AACo) at its approaching annual general meeting.
Chief executive Debby Blakey has written to the 172 ASX 200 companies that have less than 30 per cent of female directors on their boards.
"We think it's unacceptable that in 2017 some of Australia's biggest companies still have no women on their boards," Ms Blakey said.
Like Ms Proust, Ms Blakey believes quotas have unintended consequences, but concedes they may be inevitable.
"It may well be necessary; hard action might be needed at some point," Ms Blakey told the ABC.

A major study of 7.5 million road crashes has revealed the safest — and most dangerous — used cars on the market in Australia.
The Monash University-led study lists almost 400 cars on a 1-5 star rating, and found a driver in the least safe car is 10 times more likely to be killed or seriously injured than someone in the safest.
"There's an enormous difference between the best and the worst," RACV's manager of vehicle engineering, Michael Case, told News Breakfast.
"The better performing vehicles don't necessarily cost more."

The ratings are based on statistical analysis of more than 7 million crashes in Australia and New Zealand between 1987 and 2015, and the injuries that occurred in those crashes.
To be included in the list a car must have been involved in at least 100 crashes and resulted in at least 20 driver injuries.
The study also nominated more than 40 car models as "safer picks" based on their history.
"It means the vehicle not only protects its own occupants well, it's relatively a good performer in terms of its effect on other, more vulnerable road-users," Mr Case said.
"The vehicle is less likely to be involved in a crash because of new safety features we've seen introduced into the market."
Among the five-star "safer picks" were popular makes like the Toyota Prius, Ford Mondeo, Mazda 6, Honda CR-V and Holden Colorado ute.


The cars listed date back to 1986 and Mr Case said there had been a noticeable improvement in vehicle safety over the years.
"With most new cars of the past decade fitted with advanced safety features, we are now finally seeing more vehicles in the used car segment with crash avoidance systems," he said.
This means there are cheaper options on the market that still have good safety ratings.
"It is great to see that a few 'safer pick' vehicles are available second-hand for under $10,000," Mr Case said.
"This is a great outcome for young drivers, who are often on a budget and in many cases, tend to drive cars with less safety features — despite the fact that younger drivers are much more likely to be involved in a crash."


Tensions between the United States and North Korea have flared up again, which contributed to a stock market sell-off and surging gold prices.

The other main catalyst for Wall Street's gloomy day was the sharp sell-off in technology stocks — basically all the big name companies that instantly come to mind.
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho has accused US President Donald Trump of declaring war.
Mr Ri was referring to a Twitter message by Mr Trump on Saturday, in which he warned the Minister and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un "won't be around much longer" if they acted on their previous threats.
In addition, Mr Ri said Pyongyang reserved the right to take counter-measures, including shooting down US bombers — even if they are not in North Korean air space.
White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders denied the US had declared war, and called Mr Ri's accusations "absurd".
The CBOE volatility index (VIX), which measures market anxiety, has risen to a two-week high of 11 points.
Brent crude prices surged by 4 per cent overnight to $US59.17 a barrel — its highest level since July 2015.
Although this drove the energy sector higher by 1 per cent, that was not enough to offset the sharp losses in the US technology sector.
The share prices of Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Alphabet (Google's parent company) and Facebook, in particular, fell between 1 and 5 per cent within one trading day.
This resulted in the tech-heavy Nasdaq's steep decline of 0.9 per cent overnight.
Apple has had its worst week on the stock market in more than a year. Since launching its new iPhones last week, Apple's shares has plunged by 5 per cent as investors.
However, this may just be investors cashing in their profits as Apple shares have risen by more than 30 per cent over the last 12 months.
Despite the weak lead from Wall Street, ASX futures have risen by 0.25 per cent — which indicates a higher open for the local share market today.
With no key economic data out today, the focus will likely be on geopolitical developments.
The Australian dollar has fallen one-third of a per cent to 79.35 US cents.
The Greenback strengthened over market expectations of US tax reform proposals being unveiled this week.
Rio Tinto and BHP shares may come under pressure today.
After all, iron ore prices are down 0.8 per cent, and the mining giants' New York shares have both fallen by around 1.1 per cent each.


A union lawyer has told the Federal Court the Fair Work Commission failed to meet its legal obligations when it decided to cut Sunday and public holiday penalty rates.

A full court of five judges is sitting in Melbourne over the next three days to hear an appeal by unions against the commission's decision in February to cut the rates for hospitality, retail and other workers.
The lawyer representing the two unions involved, Herman Borenstein QC, told the court the commission failed to recognise the effect cutting rates would have on low-paid employees.
"There is no consideration of the position of the low-paid and their living standards," he said.
But members of the bench questioned Mr Borenstein's argument and said the commission had examined what workers were previously paid.
"What they were looking at is what they were previously paid, why is that not looking at a change in circumstances?" Justice Geoffrey Flick asked.
"They're doing the very thing you're saying they didn't do."

Speaking before the hearing, Australian Hotels Association chief executive officer Stephen Ferguson said he was confident the commission's decision would be upheld.
"We've reviewed the submissions of United Voice and others [to the Federal Court] and we believe that we're on very solid ground, or the decision of the Fair Work Commission is on very solid ground," he said.
"They were chartered by the [Federal] Parliament to conduct four-year reviews of awards.
"In our view they have complied by the act and we don't see that the grounds raised by the union will succeed [in court].
United Voice national secretary Jo Schofield, who represents hospitality workers, said the unions' appeal had a strong legal argument.
"Firstly, we think the Fair Work Commission failed to consider the relative living standards and needs of the low-paid and they are required to under the act," she said.
"We'll also argue that penalty rates form an important part of the safety net for workers in the hospitality industry."

The commission's decision was hailed by business groups, who had long argued the penalty rates were an unfair impost on employers and were holding businesses back on Sundays.

They also argued they could generate more work hours for staff if the Sunday rates were reduced.
The Federal Government also welcomed the decision.
Unions and the Opposition argued the workers whose Sunday rates would be cut were the people who could least afford it.
The size of the cuts vary between the four sectors affected. Some have had the Sunday rate slashed from 200 per cent of their Monday-Friday rate, down to 150 per cent.
Others face cuts from 150 per cent down to 125 per cent.
This week's hearing in the Federal Court is being closely watched by both sides of the argument, as it is seen as a test of the commission's powers under the act.
Also appearing at the hearing are the Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees Association and the Australian Industry Group.


Uber's chief executive has apologised for the ride-sharing app's mistakes in London and promised to change as the firm fights a decision by the city not to renew its licence.

The British capital's transport regulator last week deemed Uber unfit to run a taxi service and decided not to renew its licence to operate, which will end this week.
Transport for London (TfL) cited the firm's approach to reporting serious criminal offences and background checks on drivers.
"While Uber has revolutionised the way people move in cities around the world, it's equally true that we've got things wrong along the way," CEO Dara Khosrowshahi wrote in an open letter.
"On behalf of everyone at Uber globally, I apologise for the mistakes we've made.
"We will appeal the decision on behalf of millions of Londoners, but we do so with the knowledge that we must also change."
The company also called for talks with the regulator as soon as possible and pledged to make improvements in the way it reports serious incidents.
London Mayor Sadiq Khan asked TfL to be available to meet the Uber boss.

"I welcome the apology from Dara Khosrowshahi … Obviously I am pleased that he has acknowledged the issues that Uber faces in London," Mr Khan said in a statement.
"Even though there is a legal process in place, I have asked TfL to make themselves available to meet with him."
TfL declined to comment.
Mr Khan, a Labour politician who has criticised the firm in the past, has backed TfL's decision and attacked the Silicon Valley app's response.
"You can't have it both ways: on the one hand acting in an aggressive manner for all sorts of things but on the other hand brief to journalists that they want to do a deal with TfL," he told BBC radio.
"If you play by the rules you're welcome in London, if you don't, don't be surprised if TfL takes action against you."

London police complained earlier this year that Uber, which is backed by Goldman Sachs and BlackRock, was either not disclosing, or taking too long to report, serious crimes including sexual assaults and that this put the public at risk.
Asked about the criticism, Uber's UK Head of Cities apologised about a specific incident and said the firm was working with the Metropolitan police to make improvements to its reporting process.
"We're working with the police to figure out how we can do this in a better way that's helpful to them," Fred Jones told BBC radio.
The firm can continue to operate until the appeals process is exhausted, which is likely to take several months.
Uber, which is used by 3.5 million passengers in London, will see its current license expire on September 30.

An extraordinary audio recording has emerged which lifts the lid on the way the Seven Network treated a young woman who made a sexual harassment complaint against an older male colleague, only to be dismissed from work soon after.

In a rare insight into human resources culture at the TV network, Amy Taeuber, who was a 27-year-old cadet journalist in Adelaide, was given no notice of allegations against her before being suspended, having her phone removed and being escorted from the building.
She was also denied a support person in the meeting where she was suspended.
Ms Taeuber made a complaint about the older male reporter alleging a series of incidents, including commenting on her appearance, making disparaging remarks about her marital status and calling her a lesbian.
Days after she complained it transpired that Seven was investigating Ms Taeuber, first for a satirical memes page about a Seven reality program run by her sister Kate, which Kate said Amy had no role in.
Then Ms Taeuber was blindsided when she was called into her news director's office and presented with a series of written allegations she'd never heard of before — essentially that she had bullied a fellow cadet, with whom she was still friends, and who had not made a complaint about her.
To protect her legal rights, during the meeting Ms Taeuber placed her phone on the table and pressed record.

At the meeting Ms Taeuber was accompanied by a support person, Lesley Johns, but Ms Johns was instructed to leave the room immediately, something the media union says breaches workplace laws and the Seven Enterprise Bargaining Agreement.
"No, I'm afraid it's not appropriate for Lesley to be in the room at this point," a human resources manager said via speaker phone in the meeting.
"We're not having a meeting that needs a support person, so Lesley, I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to depart."
Ms Johns can be heard sighing.
"OK. It's really disappointing. She's a cadet who is—" Ms Johns said, but was not able to finish her sentence.
"Lesley, if you want to talk to me about this matter, we can do it at another time, but it's not appropriate at this stage," the human resources manager said.

The human resources manager then told Ms Taeuber she would be "relieved" of her phone and her Seven identity pass, that she was suspended from duty immediately and she was reminded "no touching the IT" — that is, she could not shut down her computer.
"I feel like this is humiliating me," a shocked Ms Taeuber said on the recording.
"For making a complaint in the first place, and it's really disgusting.
"This is disgusting. I've done nothing wrong.
"I've not done any of this and I'm requesting to have the statement of the person who made these allegations."
The human resources manager replied, "OK, so how do we want to plan your exit, Amy? I do understand that we don't want to make it humiliating for you."
When Ms Taeuber pushed the HR manager again for the statement of the person making the allegations about her, saying it is "quite fair" in order to answer these allegations, the HR manager told her to "put it in writing" and refused to engage with any further questions.
Ms Taeuber became tearful, telling her news director she felt "very victimised, to be honest".
"I've worked so hard to get this job and I know people are just trying to get rid of me now and it's just really upsetting," Ms Taeuber said.
"I don't really deserve any of this for standing up and having a problem with someone calling me a lesbian."
During her suspension, Ms Taeuber had no access to her phone or emails and other staff were banned from speaking to her.

"I was absolutely horrified with what had happened to Amy," her mother Linda Taeuber, told 7.30.
"As a family we were just distraught. She'd worked so hard to get that cadetship, she'd got a degree and then a Masters, she'd started at the bottom and worked her way up.
"And to have it taken away from her in the blink of an eye was just horrific."
Media, Entertainment and Arts Alliance spokeswoman Katelin McInerney said staff should be made aware of allegations against them before meetings of this nature.
"And certainly [they] should be provided at that time, with the opportunity to bring in a support person or contact [their] union for further advice.
"Certainly it does seem there have been breaches in this matter and that this cadet was not treated with the same rights that she is afforded under her enterprise agreement and under the Fair Work Act."

In another extraordinary twist, it transpired that the person Seven alleged she had bullied was her friend, cadet Peter Fegan, and he had not made a complaint about her.
Instead, Seven had appeared to have gone through her emails and found some where she was talking about Mr Fegan. He told Ms Taeuber he knew nothing about it.
"Peter didn't even know that his name was on the document," Ms Taeuber's sister Kate told 7.30.
"I've overheard many conversations with Peter and Amy talking and he was angry about it. He didn't understand why he had been brought into it."
The group of Seven cadets were in the habit of playing pranks on one another, a practice Ms Taeuber documented on videos she uploaded to YouTube. In the videos, Ms Taeuber, other young women and Mr Fegan can all been seen good-naturedly ribbing each other.
Mr Fegan and Ms Taeuber have remained friends.
"He went straight to his news director and human resources and said, 'You know this is ridiculous. I don't understand why my name is being involved. I've never made any complaints about Amy, she's my friend. I want my name taken off it'," Kate Taeuber said.
"And [Seven] just said, Sorry, it's none of your business'.
"How could it not be someone's business, their name being named as the victim of bullying?"

Former Seven human resources staff told 7.30 that what happened to Ms Taeuber was part of a systemic culture at the network.
They said trawling through emails to construct a misleading case was something the former employees regularly did to get rid of staff and something they said they felt enormously guilty about.
The recording comes in the context of widespread criticism against the network for its handling of its treatment of women through the management of former staffer Amber Harrison, who had an affair with the network CEO Tim Worner.
In a statement, the Seven Network said "there was an investigation into alleged breaches of Amy Taeuber's employment contract".
"She was dismissed because of what she said during the investigation which conflicted with the facts.
"Seven's HR team did not try to build any case against her and their investigation was not related to any complaint made by Amy about other staff."


The clock is ticking for the Federal Government to prevent businesses from suffering widespread power shortfalls over the summer.
Australian businesses want the Government to introduce gas export controls as soon as possible.
That was essentially the Australian Industry Group's (Ai Group) response to comments made by Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull on Monday — and his decision to not immediately enact the domestic gas security mechanism.
"Industry needs some decisions very quickly," Ai Group's chief executive Innes Willox said.
"It needs to be done within weeks, not months — or else we are going into a summer where AEMO has already said we face 170 days of potential shortfalls of power within south-eastern states."
The prospect of a gas shortfall next year being considerably higher than expected has been confirmed in two reports — by the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC).
The Federal government plans to discuss these reports with energy companies this week.
But Mr Willox questions whether these further discussions are even necessary.
The Government "now has all the evidence on the table," he said.
"It surely can't need any more to invoke the powers it has [to declare export controls]."
Mr Willcox said if the Government does not take action soon, there are real prospects of businesses moving offshore, or shutting their facilities in Australia.
In particular, he noted that Australian industries are currently paying four times more for power, compared to two years ago.
"This can't go on much longer, or else we do face national economic security disaster," he said.
"If the Government weren't to act now, given all the evidence we have, you have to ask why have we gone through all this pain?"
The Ai Group acts on behalf of Australian businesses across industries such as manufacturing, construction, defence and mining.
The industry group's chief also said "real downward pressure" was needed for gas prices.
"The ACCC is talking about gas between $6 to $8 a gigajoule, but companies are now paying [double], up to $16 per gigajoule," he said.
Mr Willox was also critical of the ongoing debate about the source of Australia's energy in the future.
"Give us some clear direction for policy going forward. Help us get reliable, affordable power — and power that allows us to overall meet our international obligations.
"But make it cheap, affordable — whether its coal, renewable or gas."

International students in low-wage jobs are being urged to contact the Fair Work Ombudsman if they think they have been ripped off by rogue employers.

The Ombudsman's office has written to more than half a million international students who they believe may have been short-changed on their pay or intimidated by employers for speaking up.
Last year, almost half of the complaints about wage exploitation related to visa holders, with a third involving international students, according to the Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James.
"[International students] are only about 2 per cent of all of the requests for assistance we receive every year, but they feature quite prominently in the very serious matters we take to court," Ms James said.
"Although international students are the largest group of visa holders with work rights in this country, and although we have heard many stories of very serious exploitation involving this cohort, only a very small number of them come to us for help.
"That tells us that they're not coming to us for help and advice when they should."
The Fair Work Ombudsman has placed an open letter in several major newspapers today urging international students to speak up if they believe they are being exploited in the workplace.
Ms James said often dishonest employers can threaten to report employees to the Department of Immigration if they seek advice on their working conditions.

"We find that many of them are very hesitant to come to us for help," she said.
"They find themselves working more than those 20 hours [that they are legally allowed to work], and we have seen some unscrupulous employers then use this to threaten those students to report them.
"In a number of cases, we have gained appropriate protections for visa holders in that very situation, we've taken action, we've recovered unpaid wages and we have ensured that their visa status was not affected."
Ms James said with international students contributing $22 billion to the economy annually, it is crucial they are offered protections.
For those concerned seeking help might endanger their visa status, she said the Fair Work Ombudsman has arrangements in place to account for that.
"If they suffer any sort of consequences in the workplace because they've come to us for help, like every worker in Australia they are also protected in that case," she said.
"The Fair Work Act imposes quite serious sanctions if people are terminated or lose shifts for example because they've come to the Fair Work Ombudsman for help."
Ms James said in the meantime, international students working part-time while they study should keep a record of the hours they work week to week as potential evidence.
"In the most serious occasions, when we see employers disguising hours works or falsifying records, we then have evidence to recover unpaid wages based on the information that the worker has kept for themselves," she said.
"I have been surprised and concerned. I mean that is the most appalling behaviour I think I've seen in my time as Fair Work Ombudsman."


Charles Bolden, the recently retired head of NASA, says he was surprised it took Australia this long to announce a national space agency.

It was during Mr Bolden's first trip to Australia visiting the Deep Space Network tracking station in Canberra that he realised Australia did not have one.
"My question at the time was why not?" he said.
Mr Bolden said he believed governments had a critical role to play in "blazing the trail" and laying out the path for private industry and entrepreneurs to follow.
While attending the Adelaide conference this week Mr Bolden received the International Astronautical Federation's Award for distinguished service.
As an astronaut with 680 hours in space, Mr Bolden was appointed by former president Barack Obama to lead NASA in 2009.
He led the agency in developing the Space Launch System rocket and Orion spacecraft — designed to take humans to Mars.
Mr Bolden said Australia had long played a role alongside NASA and international space agencies in "pushing humans farther and farther out into our solar system".
Events such as Neil Armstrong's first steps on the moon and the Curiosity Rovers' landing on Mars were all covered by the Deep Space Network tracking station in Australia.

So, if Australia has been playing an important role in space exploration for all these years, why is there a need to establish a national space agency?
Mr Bolden said an agency would pull together industry, academia and entrepreneurs under the one umbrella of government oversight.
"You'll be able to push and incentivise the private industry to take steps that they themselves may not otherwise take," he said.
"Because they're more focused on profit and very cautious about investments that they make.
"That's where the Australian Government will be able to step forward and actually become the risk-taker — what we call in the United States the 'anchor tenant' for the activities of the private sector."
The heads of NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA) have warmly welcomed the announcement of an Australian space agency.
ESA director general Jan Woener even suggested Australia could go a step further and join the ESA as a cooperative member.
In the 1960s Australia was an associate member of the European Launcher Development Organisation.
"If we come to very close cooperation we are ready also to welcome Australia as a cooperative state," he said.

Acting NASA administrator Robert Lightfoot said his agency has had a great partnership with Australia for a long time and the announcement is an excellent opportunity to increase the collaboration and cooperation.
"I look forward to seeing what niche areas that Australia decides they want to focus on and I think that'll be their challenge," he said.

NASA's target, laid out by Mr Obama, was to put humans in the Martian environment by 2030.
"I think most of us believe that's a date we can make," Mr Bolden said.
"Like any challenging program, or anything that's ambitious, you have ups and downs."
Mr Bolden said they were going well in the development of the Heavy Lift Launch Vehicle, the Shuttle Landing Facility and Orion crew module, which would be responsible for getting humans to deep space.
"We're looking forward to the first flight of the two, of the launch vehicle and the capsule itself together, hopefully as early as late 2018 or 2019," he said.
He also said NASA was working with its international partners on a Deep Space Gateway, which would orbit vehicles in lunar orbit.
The outpost would be used to test technologies in a deep space environment and also to be used as a staging area for missions to Mars.
During Mr Bolden's time at NASA the shuttle program was phased out in order to offer more opportunities to the commercial space industry.
"To provide routine transportation to and from space for cargo first, as we're doing now very successfully, and later for humans," he said.

But as NASA's partnership and often reliance on private companies, such as Elon Musk's SpaceX has grown, Mr Bolden said he had some concerns about the shift.
"Any time you open up an enterprise like space exploration and decide that you're going to share responsibility among government, private enterprise… entrepreneurs, there is a risk," he said.
"[The risk is] that they will find that it's economically just not a good thing to do, and they may walk away.
"But I'm convinced that most of our partners today believe in the same things that we do."
A number of privately funded space projects working independently of NASA have announced plans to be taking tourists to space, even as far as Mars.
Mr Bolden said his concern with that was a matter of concern for human life and the welfare of the environment.
"The one thing about working with an agency like NASA, the European Space Agency… is that they represent the organisation that has overall fiduciary responsibility for the safety of the populace," he said.
"And for the economic use of the public's funds. Private enterprises may not …feel those same responsibilities."
One particular subject Mr Bolden said he was not a fan of were the one-way trips to Mars, advertised and promoted by the Mars One initiative.
"I'm not in favour of that, to be quite honest, I think it's somewhat irresponsible," he said.
"One of my jobs when I was the NASA administrator was to do the best I could do to take care of the life and prosperity of every person that participated in any of our programs."
Mr Bolden resigned from NASA just after Donald Trump's inauguration, something he said "came by law".
When a new administration comes in it is up to them to turn down a resignation, which Mr Bolden said rarely ever happens.
He said he had some concerns about the new Trump administration, as historically any new government wants to "establish their own legacy".
"My hope would be that President Trump step back for a while, take a good hard look at where NASA is and where we're going with our international partners," he said.
"My advice to them would be the advice that I was given and that I give everybody else — fold their arms for the next year or two and take credit for everything that happens."


Gas shortages on the east coast could be three times worse than expected, but it has not prompted Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull to immediately introduce export controls.

New reports from the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) and the competition watchdog warn the prospect of a gas shortfall next year is considerably higher than expected.
The Federal Government will discuss the reports with energy companies this week and remind them that if the shortage is not addressed, then exports will be restricted.
The vast majority of gas produced in Australia is shipped overseas, which has been blamed for the shortage and the increasing gas prices in the eastern states.
Mr Turnbull foreshadowed the market intervention earlier this year, in a bid to secure supply in 2018.
These new reports indicate gas companies will need to do more than initially expected to ensure enough local supply and to avoid the export controls.
AEMO now projects shortfall of up to 107 petajoules in 2018 and 102 petajoules in 2019, warning risk of energy blackouts requires "close attention and monitoring".
The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) warns the supply-demand outlook has "significantly deteriorated" since its last inquiry, with a "substantial shortfall" now likely in 2018.

Mr Turnbull said the export controls would not be introduced without consultation with the energy industry, and they could be avoided if gas companies acted quickly.

"We want to see a plan from them — we want to see a commitment — then we want to be satisfied that it meets the requirements of the ACCC," Mr Turnbull said.
"Clearly, the objective is for the industry to fix the problem by agreement."
While Mr Turnbull has not pulled the trigger on export controls, he has made it clear to energy companies that the Federal Government is willing to do so.
"We will continue to hold that mechanism ready to go and we will ensure that it is entirely fit-for-purpose in light of these changed circumstances, that is, a much bigger shortage than previously advised," he said.
"If we are not able to receive the assurances from the industry to our satisfaction and that of the ACCC, then we will impose those export controls."
Opposition Leader Bill Shorten has repeated his calls for export restrictions to be immediately imposed, tweeting "it's time to pull the trigger on export controls. Why does [Mr Turnbull] refuse?"
Labor's energy spokesman Mark Butler said the Government was delaying action on export controls.
"The Prime Minister should have today declared a shortage that reflected the advice he received from the market operator," he said.
"We think the trigger has to be pulled and there has to be a formal declaration that the gas market in Australia is up to 100 petajoules of gas short."


The dying wish of Tasmanian pilot Lloyd Jones MBE, the first person to land a plane on Lake Pedder beach in the late 1940s, was to have his ashes scattered over that pristine sand.

However in 1972, the renowned pink quartzite beach was flooded for a new hydroelectric scheme, triggering one of the nation's first major environmental struggles.
But last Friday, 14 years after Mr Jones's death, his friends, family and members of Tasmania's Aero Club finally fulfilled his wish to have his ashes scattered from a plane flying over south-west Lake Pedder, as it is today.
Mr Jones was a member of the Nos 92 and 93 Beaufighter Squadrons near the end of World War II and later pioneered the Aero Club in southern Tasmania.
Flying all over the state, Mr Jones was well known for his aerial photography of Tasmania's south-west wilderness.
But it was his work in the community that earned him the Member of the British Empire (MBE) bestowed by Queen Elizabeth II.
"My father did a lot of air rescue work before the days of flying doctors," daughter Jennifer Rayner said.
"He would be called out to rescue people when it wasn't safe to reach them any other way.
"He saw so much of the state which wasn't accessible ... he'd often make food drops to bushwalkers as well."
To Ms Rayner, Mr Jones was an adoring father.
Listening to his daring flying tales and sitting with him in light aircraft as they took off are some of her fondest childhood memories.
"It was always very exciting because the aircrafts were very small and it's an amazing feeling to be up in the air in one of these things," she said.

But tragedy struck in 1960 when an accident that almost cost Mr Jones his life ended his flying career.

During a quiet afternoon at the Aero Club headquarters, Mr Jones took a spin in a go-cart around an empty hanger.
Unfortunately, he crashed into a heavy metal hanger door.
Many worried Mr Jones might not live from his injuries.
Paralysed down the right side of his body, he made a slow recovery but never regained his full capacity to speak and had to use a walking stick for the rest of his life.
Ms Rayner said the accident was very hard on her father.
"He couldn't fly again because of his injuries. That was very difficult for him," she said.
Ms Rayner said she was happy she could fulfil her father's dream while also celebrating the Aero club's 70th anniversary.
"He was the first instructor of the Aero Club and trained many young pilots and he was very proud of it," she said.
"I think he'd still be very proud of it today."
Mr Jones died aged 88.



If you had to imagine the worst possible occasion for an air traffic control system failure, Monday would have to be it.
Australia's busiest airport. Monday morning. Peak hour. At the start of school holidays.
With systems down at Sydney Airport, aircraft movements had virtually ground to a halt.
Broadcasts from Live ATC reveal how it sounded from the skies.
Controller: Just for your information we're having issues with our flight plan and radar system. There's a possibility of delay.

Pilot (getting ready for take-off): Confirming we can expect [runway] 16 right for departure?
Controller: Qantas 565 ah no, nothing at this stage. There's been a total radar failure within the Sydney basin, so it's a nationwide ground stop. The only arrivals that are being processed are those that are airborne, and I don't believe we're accepting any departures until the radar's back online.
Pilot: The estimate of the delay?
Controller: You got a piece of string?
Pilot: Fair enough.
Controller: The techs are working on it. Every time it reboots it locks up again so, ah yeah, until it's reliable there'll be no movements.

Controller: Emirates 412 [inaudible] tower G'day continue approach.
Controller: Emirates 412 I don't have a radar so I'm not sure who's behind you ... just standby.

Controller: Betcha never seen this place so quiet on a Monday morning.
Pilot: Like a ghost town.

Pilot: You guys going to get your [inaudible] together shortly, or are you gonna be out for a while?
Controller: We're not sure, it's been out since five and we've got some sort of radar picture back and it's back as normal, not degraded, so it's not a good sign so not sure what's going to happen.
Pilot: Good luck. Long day for you guys.
Controller: Think we're gonna need it.



While the fault has been fixed, travellers have been warned to prepare for delays throughout as airlines deal with a backlog.
Passengers have been urged to contact their airlines for further information.

"The software fault failed to convert from night-shift operations to day-shift operations, consequently one air traffic control console was operational for the morning peak when in normal circumstances six to eight consoles are operating," Airservices Australia said in a statement on Monday afternoon.
"Airservices is confident that it was not a cyber incident, it was a hardware failure."
The ABC understands the fault was related to the flight planning system which feeds into the radar and without it, controllers cannot see which plane is which.
It is also believed the data connection between Sydney and Melbourne was down.


A new fight is emerging between the nation's major banks and the Federal Government, with the Australian Bankers Association (ABA) protesting at a one-week consultation timeframe for the new Bank Executive Accountability Regime.

The so-called BEAR will ensure that up to 40 per cent of senior bank executives' remuneration is deferred and can be lost if they fail in their corporate governance duties.
Senior bank executives and directors will also have to be registered with the banking regulator, APRA, and will risk disqualification if they breach their duties.
Big banks will also face penalties of up to $210 million if their executives breach their duties.
Draft legislation for the BEAR was released on Friday, with submissions from interested parties due this Friday, September 29.
The limited consultation period has infuriated the main banking lobby group, which said it is "shocked" to have only a week to read through and comment on 34 pages of draft legislation and a 33-page explanatory memorandum.
"This is not good public policy making," the Australian Bankers Association's chief executive Anna Bligh told RN Breakfast.

"Banks have accepted that this regime will be coming into place, they are very keen to work cooperatively with the Government to get that regime right, and there are still some outstanding questions about it.
"I can't think of another piece of legislation that's had a seven-day turnaround."
However, Treasurer Scott Morrison said the banks had plenty of advanced warning about the content of the new laws.
"I first raised this with bank chairs back in February of this year," he said.
"We had the consultation on the specific proposals for the legislation back in July, it was flagged in the budget.
"So this is one of the oldest tricks in the book, I know it's a quick turnaround, but I'm not mucking around."
Mr Morrison told RN Breakfast that the banks are trying to stall for time in the hope of killing the new regulations.

"I know the bank's don't want a lot of these things to be in there, but I'm not about to give them three months to make the case why they shouldn't be in there, they're going in," he said.
One of the changes the ABA is keen to see to the law is the inclusion of other financial companies.
"It's currently proposed only to apply to banks, even though APRA — the regulatory body charged with administering the regime — has extensive oversight powers over a much broader financial sector," Ms Bligh said.
"Banks recruit not only from other banks, they recruit from the insurance sector, they recruit from the superannuation sector — employment is very mobile across the entire finance sector.
"It seems to banks to make a lot of sense, to make sure that the regime actually works in the way the Government wants it to, that it should apply to executives across the whole range of finance."

Mr Morrison responded that the BEAR is specifically to designed to address risks around so-called authorised deposit-taking institutions (ADIs), which had to be held to a higher standard because they are responsible for customer deposits.
However, Ms Bligh said other financial institutions were likewise responsible for large amounts of Australians' savings.
"I think Australians want to know that there is accountability in the executive teams not only of banks, who look after their money, but of superannuation that's looking after their long term retirement, within their insurance companies," she argued.
"These are substantial financial investments for Australians and I don't see any strong public policy reasons for the regime to exist in only one part of the finance sector."


The national maritime safety watchdog says it has given a northern cruise company a final warning in relation to safety breaches after a tourist was accidentally left on a remote Kimberley beach.
The Broome-based charter company Ahoy Buccaneers has been shut down twice in recent years due to issues with the seaworthiness, stability, electrical wiring and firefighting equipment on board its vessel MV Oceanic.
The most recent incident occurred in June at a picturesque beach in the Kimberley where more than a dozen passengers had been dropped off to walk up a hill and look at Aboriginal rock art.
The Raft Point site is very remote, located 180 kilometres from the nearest town, is inaccessible by road and often unvisited by boats for days at a time.
The Australian Maritime Safety Authority's (AMSA) manager of compliance David Marsh said the boat's skipper failed to notice that one of the passengers had wandered off the track and had not reboarded the small transport dinghy.
"As they were bringing their passengers back on board their main boat it appeared that one of their passengers had been left behind unfortunately, for a brief period of time," Mr Marsh said.
"It was brought to their attention by another operator. So yes, the vessel did come back around and pick up that passenger, but yes quite concerning that they'd left someone behind."
Ahoy Buccaneers downplayed the incident, saying that the passenger was not at risk and her absence would have been noticed before the MV Oceanic set sail.
The company declined an interview, but told the ABC that there was no possibility she would have been left overnight.
But AMSA says the case highlights a lack of basic safety practices.
"The most important thing here to remember is that a head count would have identified this, so whether the vessel left or whether it didn't is not really that important," Mr Marsh said.
"The point is that they were unaware that that person was not aboard their boat ... it is serious, there's no doubt about it."
The authority issued the company with a prohibition notice requiring immediate changes to safety practices, along with a three-month direction notice requiring extra inspections and record keeping.
AMSA says Ahoy Buccaneers has so far complied with the order, but given its safety record over the past three years the latest regulatory action is being treated as a final warning.
"What it means is that this really is a final chance for the operator. We have given the company a chance to show and to demonstrate and understand the importance of safety and what that means to themselves, the passengers, and to the vessel," Mr Marsh said.
"If at the end of that period they're unable to demonstrate adequately that they've taken this seriously, then AMSA will take more serious and perhaps a permanent compliance action against the operator."

The company's launch in 2015 heralded the first low-budget cruise option in the Kimberley, with locals and tourists welcoming the introduction of a $1,500 eight-day itinerary.
Until then, the market had been dominated by upmarket cruises charging between $10,000 and $20,000 to visit the region's spectacular coastal waterfalls and rock art.
But the company was soon on the radar of safety authorities, who in September 2015 temporarily suspended its operations due to concerns about a lack of safety equipment onboard MV Oceanic.
A year later it was shut down again when inspectors found problems with firefighting equipment, a lack of emergency hatches, and the vessel's seaworthiness.
At the time the company told the ABC the two week shutdown cost them thousands of dollars and should not have been done during the Kimberley's peak tourist season.
Despite that, many who have travelled on MV Oceanic said they were happy to have a no-frills option in order to see a part of Australia they otherwise would not have been able to afford.
"I really enjoyed it, it was really adventurous," said Daryl Clarke, who went on an eight-day cruise in 2015.
"There were a few things that went wrong with the boat, but as far as bang-for-buck it was great ... you get what you pay for is the moral of the story."
However his friend Liam Gerner said for him the obvious safety problems overshadowed the trip.
"It was definitely one of the greatest places I've ever seen, but the safety of the boat just wasn't up to scratch ... I mean all of the attitudes of staff, really, it was a culture of just brewing tragedy really," Mr Gerner said.
"I don't think staff really took safety seriously enough ... there was a real attitude of gung-ho 'we're going to show you a wild adventure'. And I think that's fine, but there's got to be a limit."
He said passengers who were meant to be sleeping in swags on beaches refused to do so because of the crocodile risk, so instead squeezed onto the boat's deck, leading to almost thirty people sharing two toilets.
The directions notice requiring extra monitoring of Ahoy Buccaneers is due to conclude in October.
Ahoy Buccaneers has told the ABC it plans to continue to provide affordable cruises to the Kimberley coast in accordance with national law.


Thousands of airline passengers are facing delays, including families heading off for the school holidays, following an air traffic control system failure in Sydney.
Dozens of flights have been cancelled while many more are experiencing delays of more than two hours.
One pilot described the Harbour City's skies as being "like a ghost town" to air traffic control as he came in to land.

Air Services Australia (ASA) said there had been a "system software failure" at Sydney's air traffic control at 5:00am.
As a result, only a limited number of flights were able to land and depart.
ASA said the glitch had now been resolved but the airlines expected disruptions to continue as they dealt with a massive backlog.
There are long queues at check-in and transfer desks.
ABC News obtained a radio exchange from one plane landing at Kingsford Smith — normally the country's busiest airport — this morning.
Controller: "Betcha never seen this place so quiet on a Monday morning."
Pilot: "Like a ghost town."


Passengers are facing delays of up to three hours while others are having to wait until tomorrow morning to board a flight.

Some of the major airlines expect to put on additional services to ease the disruptions.
Jan Ibbottson is on holidays from the UK and said it was frustrating her flight to the Gold Coast was cancelled.
"I'm very calm about it, but it's chaos," she said.
Ms Ibbottson said the airlines had not handled the situation well.
About 15 planes can land and depart per hour using manual air traffic control methods, but there are usually about 50 movements per hour.
ABC journalist Lexy Hamilton-Smith's 7:30am flight from Sydney to Brisbane was delayed.
She said passengers have spent more than an hour on board QF506 while the plane waits on the tarmac, but only passengers with no check-in baggage have been allowed to get off.

Kay Wallace from Bunbury in Western Australia is in Sydney attempting to get to Hobart for the 50th anniversary of the Hash House Harriers social running club.
Her flight from Perth to Melbourne overnight was cancelled and she was put on a flight to Sydney.
"The backlog here has to be cleared before we can even look like going to Hobart," Ms Wallace said.
The ABC understands the fault relates to the flight planning system.

This feeds into the radar picture and without it, controllers cannot see which plane is which.
It is also believed the data connection between Sydney and Melbourne was down.
The Qantas departure board lists flights to Melbourne, Brisbane and Adelaide "delayed due ATC Radar Failure".
Passengers have been urged to contact their airlines.





Separate events, different states, alternate days.
Between them, however, competition kahuna Rod Sims and Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull last week demolished an old chestnut about renewable energy: it is not the cause for the recent spike in electricity prices.
In fact, according to both, it has had very little impact.
For the past decade or more, we've been bombarded with the message from a vocal but powerful minority within Parliament and the broader community that the switch to renewable energy has made Australia uncompetitive, crippled our industry and driven power prices higher.
The real issue is that, fundamentally, they don't believe climate change is real or that humans have adversely affected the planet.
Having spent so long denying science and rejecting the overwhelming body of evidence, they're now being forced to ignore economics; that renewables have become a cheaper longer term power source.
Coal is the future, they argue.

That's simply not a view shared by the power generators, whose primary motivation is to turn a profit and stay in business, or the banks who must finance them.
Nor is it a view shared by BHP, the nation's biggest company that built a large part of its wealth on coal exports.
Last week, it confirmed it was reviewing its membership of the Minerals Council of Australia because of "materially different positions" on issues such as a Clean Energy Target and climate change.
Technical innovation around renewable energy generation has seen costs plummet.

As the theatre over keeping open the creaking Liddell coal-fired power station in NSW's Hunter Valley played an encore last week, the ACCC boss and the PM delivered a few sobering nuggets.
First, there was Rod Sims at the National Press Club in Canberra on Wednesday: "Forty-one per cent of the increase in electricity prices over the last 10 years has been in network costs and we keep forgetting that."
He went on: "Those poles and wires that run down your street are the main reason you are paying too much for your electricity."

According to Mr Sims, extra retail charges account for 24 per cent of the higher prices while higher generation costs as a result of a failure to invest make up 19 per cent of the price hikes.
Green energy initiatives contribute just 16 per cent to the recent price hikes.
On Thursday in Brisbane, responding to questions, the PM concurred, explaining that "particularly for retail customers, the largest single part of your bill is the network costs."
"That's the poles and wires basically," he said.

But then he elaborated on the more immediate issues, particularly around generation and the changes that have been foisted upon consumers.
"In terms of the green schemes, they do have a cost but it is a relatively small cost," he said.
"Gas is the biggest single fact at this point in time."
What does gas have to do with it? As the PM explained, the electricity price is set by the last generator to come into the stack.
It's what economists call the marginal cost of production. You might be to meet half the demand at low price. But it is the expensive bit at the end that determines how much a producer will charge everyone.
When it comes to electricity, gas is that last final element.
"It is peaking power," the PM said. "The increase in the gas price has increased the cost of electricity."
Gas prices haven't just increased. They have quadrupled.
And the tragedy is that Australia, with one of the greatest reserves of gas on the planet, now charges its households and businesses far more to use that energy than the countries to which we export.

With the continued reversal of policy on carbon pricing and climate change, the unofficial industry consensus was to build solar and wind generation with gas-fired back-up to shore up reliability; a decision affirmed by the chief scientist Alan Finkel in his report on how to cope with future challenges.
But three major export terminals were built at Curtis Island just off Gladstone in Queensland, with Santos building a plant that required far more gas than to which it had access.
To fulfil its export contracts, it began sourcing gas previously destined for the domestic market.
That forced the price of domestic gas sky high just as a global glut sent international prices crashing.
It's now cheaper to buy Australian gas in Asia. A fortnight ago, gas from West Australia's giant Gorgon project was sold to India at $8.70 a gigajoule. East coast gas sells here for $17.50.
That's why the Federal Government has shanghaied gas producers like Santos to direct export gas back into the local market.
If Australians could get the same deal on our gas that Indians have secured, our electricity would be much cheaper.


When it comes to cost, coal lobbyists usually refer to the subsidies doled out to the renewable sector to argue the industry wouldn't exist if it had to stand on its own.
That's a valid point. But it overlooks two things; the vast billions handed out to the coal industry and the increasing competitiveness of renewables.
Every coal fired generator in Australia was built, not just partially subsidised, entirely with taxpayer funds.
When they were privatised, many were given state owned coal mines with contract prices way below market, effectively a further subsidy.
Then there are the health costs.
A health study in the Latrobe Valley last year identified much higher respiratory and asthma admissions to hospital than the Victorian average while life expectancy was significantly lower than the state average.
But it is the cost of energy generation where the game really is changing.
As the Goldman Sachs graphs above show, renewable energy costs have plunged by up to 70 per cent since 2009 and will be the cheapest form of generation in Europe this year and in the US within eight years on a levelised cost basis.
When the cost of installation is taken into account, however, the story changes.

Wind and solar are much cheaper. Not only is the fuel free and faces no regulatory risk — in the form of a carbon price — but the technology is simpler and quicker to install.
Australia's chief scientist Alan Finkel went one step further. He factored the extra costs of adding gas or battery backup to ensure stability or baseload power in the system.
Wind still came out cheapest, with solar only marginally more expensive than black coal.

Renewable plants can be built within one to three years while coal-fired plants take between four and seven years to build.
Putting aside arguments about climate change, the main problem with coal-fired electricity is that the numbers no longer stack up.
It's too expensive, it has much higher regulatory risks and renewable technology is rapidly advancing.
It will take more than a taxpayer subsidy to build one here. It will need a full taxpayer handout. And it will result in more expensive power bills.
Coal is simply a form of stored solar energy. New technology has delivering cleaner, more efficient and cheaper ways to directly harvest solar energy to power our lives.
Don't expect that innovation to stop.


British actor Colin Firth, who often plays the role of a quintessential Englishman in his many films, has become an Italian citizen, Italy's Interior Ministry says.
"The very famous actor, who won an Oscar for the film The King's Speech, is married to a citizen from our country and has often declared his love for our land," the ministry said in a statement.

Firth said he would remain a dual national, adding that his Italian-born wife would also be seeking British nationality.
"We never really thought much about our different passports," the actor said in a statement.
"But now, with some of the uncertainty around, we thought it sensible that we should all get the same," he added, in an apparent reference to last year's British vote to leave the European Union.
Firth has been married to Italian film producer Livia Giuggioli since 1997 and the couple live with their two sons in Britain.

Unlike some other EU countries, Italy and Britain both allow dual nationality.
"My wife and I are both extremely proud of our own countries," Firth said.
A number of EU countries, including Germany, France and Ireland, have reported a surge in British citizens seeking a new nationality in the wake of the Brexit vote.
The Italian announcement came just hours after British Prime Minister Theresa May flew to Florence to make a keynote speech to try to revive stalled Brexit negotiations and reassure worried business leaders.
Firth has been quoted as calling Brexit a "disaster of unexpected proportions".
The actor, who has played Mr Darcy in Pride and Prejudice and Prince Albert in The King's Speech, said he "will always be extremely British" but also has "a passionate love of Italy".

Dozens of motorists on the Mitchell Freeway watched a man clinging to the outside of a moving train in Perth on Saturday afternoon.
The 23-year-old was arrested after he climbed onto the rear of a train before it left Leederville Station and reached speeds of up to 110 kilometres an hour.
The Public Transport Authority (PTA) said he could easily have been killed.
"He was clinging on to a windscreen wiper — were he to fall it's a very unfriendly and unreceptive surface with ballast and rail and concrete sleepers, he would have almost certainly been killed, if not badly injured" PTA spokesman David Hynes said.
A Main Roads employee spotted the man around 4:30pm on Saturday between Leederville and Glendalough stations while monitoring traffic, and immediately notified the PTA.
The PTA said by the time they could react the train was close to Glendalough Station where it was scheduled to stop.
The PTA monitored the situation on CCTV as the man got off the rear of the train and went inside the carriage.
He was detained after the train arrived at the next stop, Stirling Station, by waiting PTA officers.

Mr Hynes said it was the first time the PTA has ever been made aware of a train surfer during the act.
"In all other instances it generally goes up on Facebook or on the internet, on YouTube after the event," he said.
"They want to get on YouTube, they want mainstream publicity so they don't try to get themselves caught, so we don't often know about it until it's well after the event.
"This is the first time in the memory of anyone at the PTA that we've actually known about it while it was happening."
The PTA do not currently have a policy to deal with train surfers caught in the act but Mr Hynes said it was something they would consider.
Transport Minister Rita Saffioti said there will be an investigation into the incident and the decision to continue on to the station will be looked at during the process.
"The PTA made a judgement call and there will be an investigation, but these types of situations cannot happen and should not happen on our trains," Ms Safiotti said.
"People shouldn't be acting stupidly around our rail line, these are serious pieces of infrastructure and they can cause death and of course they can cause serious injuries" she said.
The man was taken to hospital to undergo a mental health assessment and could face charges for trespassing on Public Transport Authority property.


The days of hunting for your own bank's ATM to make a free withdrawal could soon be a thing of the past, with all four of the big banks announcing they will axe fees for customers of other banks.
CBA, Westpac, ANZ and NAB banks said they were aware of the deep unpopularity of "foreign ATM" fees among Australians.
The CBA was the first to abolish the $2 fee for each withdrawal by non-customers.
"We have been listening to consumer groups and our customers and understand that there's a need to make changes that benefit all Australians, this is one of the steps we're taking to make that happen," said Matt Comyn, group executive of retail banking services.
Westpac quickly followed suit, emphasising the benefits afforded to those in regional and rural Australia.
"We want all Australians, whether they are Westpac Group customers or not, to benefit from one of Australia's largest ATM networks," Westpac executive George Frazis said.
"This will make it more convenient for millions of Australians to conveniently obtain cash, with no additional fees.
"It will particularly assist Australians in rural and regional areas."
ANZ then announced it would dump ATM fees from October.
"We know ATM fees are one of the most unpopular and while our customers have benefitted from our network of ATMs across the country, this is another example of acting on customer feedback as well as genuine reform from the industry," executive Fred Ohlsson said.

Lastly, NAB announced their move to drop the fees, calling the decision a "good outcome for customers".
"We know it has been frustrating for them to be charged to withdraw their own money from an ATM, and the change we are announcing today will benefit millions of Australians," chief customer officer Andrew Hagger said.
There were more than 250 million withdrawals across all Australian banks by non-customers last financial year, according to Reserve Bank data.
Together, Australian financial institutions made $500 million from these fees over the financial year.
Treasurer Scott Morrison pointed to Federal Government pressure as the reason behind the CBA's decision.
"The Turnbull Government has been working hard to ensure bank customers get a better deal and this is further evidence we are getting results," the Treasurer said in a statement.
Opposition Leader Bill Shorten earlier described the fees as a "rort".
"The Commonwealth Bank has finally realised that the game is up and the rort has got to stop," Mr Shorten said.
He attributed the move to pressure from the Opposition for a banking royal commission.
Banking analyst from Digital Finance Analytics, Martin North, said it is not a huge shock to see the big banks ditch this fee.
"There's no doubt that the volume of transactions through ATMs is falling as more and more people are paying for things by cards, swiping and those sort of things," he said.
"So essentially you could argue that this particular source of revenue was on the way down anyway.
"It's yesterday's banking model … the future is all about mobile payments and it's about pay and go and so perhaps there was always going to be a decrease in the revenue from this source.
"Maybe it's about picking the time to try and make a bit of a splash about it."
Consumer group Choice had also been urging the other banks to remove the fees.
"We shouldn't be paying them, the United Kingdom has already shown they can run an ATM network that is free of fees," Choice spokesman Tom Godfrey said.


So the world didn't spin off its axis and global markets didn't melt down as the US Federal Reserve announced it would start winding back its multi-trillion-dollar experiment in monetary policy.

Even the slightly more hawkish than expected tone from chair Janet Yellen and the firming of another rate hike before Christmas did little if any damage, bar knocking Wall Street down a few points from its record high.
Learning a lesson from former chair Ben Bernanke's misstep that inspired the "Taper Tantrum" in 2013, the market was well and truly softened up this time.
Back in June, the Fed presaged how it would extricate itself from the revolution in monetary policy called Quantitative Easing (QE).
So has QE worked and what impact will decommissioning it — Quantitative Tightening — have?
Briefly, the answer to the first part of the question will not be known until answers to the second part are tabled.
Back in 2008, the GFC — or the Great Recession as it is known in the US — was causing havoc and the Fed had run out of traditional monetary firepower having cut interest rates to zero with little or no effect.
In desperation, the plan was to conjure money out of thin air to buy mortgage backed securities (MBS) — the toxic sort of stuff that ignited the GFC in the first place — and treasury bonds to drive down long-term interest rates.
The idea was cheap credit would get business back on its feet and save the day. Tidying up the excesses of the money printing party would come at a later date.
That is where the Fed is now.
And it is quite a job to tidy everything up.
The printing presses were effectively turned off in October 2014. But before that three waves of QE, plus the allied Operation Twist, created $US3.5 trillion.
Pretty well all of that debt binge is still sitting on the Fed's $US4.5 trillion balance sheet, while the new money it released is still sloshing around the economy.

When QE1 was rolled out the US was mired in recession. It took a few quarters, but the economy did return to growth.
It suffered a couple more negative quarters — most recently in early 2014 — and a couple of near misses, but undeniably the economy is growing again.
The GDP numbers out later this week are expected to show year-on-year growth at around 3 per cent in the March quarter, although 2 per cent appears to be around the current longer term trend.

The impact on employment has been striking, taking the jobless rate down from a 16 year high to almost 4 per cent.
Given maximising employment is one of the Fed's mandates, it can point to jobs growth as one of the successes of its QE regime.

Another part of the Fed's mandate — stabilising prices — has not been so successful. In fact, it has been driving the Fed nuts.
The Fed like most of the key central banks has an inflation target. In the US it is 2 per cent, the RBA gives itself a degree of latitude of 2-to-3 per cent.
Even after pouring trillions into the economy and pumping up asset prices, such as the share market, inflation remains stubbornly low.

The inflation conundrum is particularly evident in the weak wages growth that has not recovered since the Great Recession.
Despite strong job creation, wage growth is half pre-GFC levels.
That result is central to the current debate about inequality and how the recovery has left behind the hardest hit by the excesses of financial engineers and the big banks.

Those investing in the stock market have been the big winners out of the waves of QE and Operation Twist.
The key index, the S&P500, has almost quadrupled since early 2009.
The easy money has driven the second longest bull run in US history as investors piled in looking for yield that the Fed had killed off in the bond market.
The low interest rates had another consequence of allowing companies to buy back swathes of the shares with cheap debt underwritten by the Fed, driving the market ever higher and the inequality gap wider.

The huge bull run is central to what could go wrong when Quantitative Tightening kicks in next month.
Basically the Fed plans to destroy a large part of the debt it has built up on its balance sheet by not rolling it over as it matures.
It just disappears into the rarefied financial air where it was created. Magic.
It starts modestly enough with $US6 billion in treasury bonds and $US4 billion in mortgage backed securities a month.
By the end of 2018 that will hit $US50 billion a month, or $US600 billion year.
At that pace, it should take three years to make half of the $US3.6 trillion it conjured up, simply disappear.
But just at QE inflated the market rapidly, it doesn't take much imagination to see what reversing it through QT could do.
It may well be half the money, but it is in half time as well.
The bears out there say yes.
So far the markets reaction has been muted.
But once QT gets rolling it will gain an almost unstoppable momentum. Only another meltdown is likely to halt it.
Not only will liquidity start drying up, it will be at a time when the Fed is attempting to get interest rates back to something approaching normal.

It has already started conventional tightening, with four hikes since late 2015. The December meeting should see a fifth.
It is a delicate job.
The Fed needs to build up its conventional interest rate buffer to prepare for the next down-turn, but without triggering a new one.
So far that process has seen a few wobbles, but nothing drastic.
Importantly, it hasn't put a brake on either the economy or job creation.
The biggest question is whether QE pushed the US economy up to a self-sustaining speed where it won't fall over again.
In other words did QE work its magic, or was it just all a dangerous and calamitously expensive conjuring trick?
QT is about to provide the answer.
Futures trading points to a modestly positive start to the week despite Wall Street's flat finish.

There are few top shelf items in the calendar. A couple of AGM's including one at AGL and herbicide maker, Nufarm trots out full year results.
The market will be looking at private sector credit (Friday) to see whether business lending is picking up as property lending cools.
Overseas, there is a blanket bombing of speeches from Fed and ECB officials. That doesn't necessarily lead to clarity though.
Commodities are likely to be where a fair bit of interest will centre.
Iron ore had a shocker last week. Spot prices sank another 4 per cent on Friday, bringing the weekly loss to 12 per cent.
It was the fourth straight week of losses and with Chinese demand on the wane and tougher air pollution controls starting in November, it is hard to see where a change in sentiment will come from.
Oil on the other hand, finished strongly, with the global benchmark Brent crude up 0.6 per cent to $56.41 a barrel.
Oil has risen more than 10 per cent in the past three weeks as evidence of the production cut deal between OPEC and Russia is holding.
There were words of caution out of the OPEC meeting in Vienna on Friday pointing to Libya and Nigeria — two troubled producers exempt from the deal — rapidly expanding their pumping, keeping a lid on price rises and slowing the removal of the glut.

Victorians will be able to pay their car registration in quarterly or half-yearly instalments from January, two years after the Government flagged introducing the measure to help low-income families struggling with their bills.
The option will be available for cars, utes, vans, motorcycles and other light vehicles, and can be taken up by anyone regardless of income.
Consumer rights groups have been urging the Victorian Government to consider changes for years, and in 2015 the Andrews Government flagged introducing quarterly payments for low-income families.
Victorian Roads Minister Luke Donnellan said the VicRoads IT system had to be upgraded before the instalment option could be introduced.
"It'll be ready to go on January 1, 2018, but we needed to upgrade the IT system to accommodate the approximately five million transaction per year," he said.

The Government said there would a $2.45 administration fee per transaction to cover costs for people who take up the option.
Mr Donnellan said smaller registration payments every three or six months would help Victorians struggling to make ends meet.
"Cars are very important in terms of mobility, in terms of job opportunities, and in terms of running a family," he said.
"People can actually in a sense budget for this and this is very much something they'll welcome because $200 and 20 cents is a lot more affordable than paying 800 and 80 cents all at once."
The Victorian Council of Social Services is one group that has pushed for change.

Its CEO Emma King said the annual registration bill was s source of dread for many families.
"It's like an annual wrecking ball through the family budget — most people don't have that sort of cash laying around," she said.
"Being able to pay in small, regular and manageable instalments makes sense.
"Many other government payments can be made by instalments. The car rego shouldn't be any different."
The Government said there would a $2.45 administration fee per transaction to cover costs for people who take up the option.


Producers in Northern Australia have had a chance to show off their best and unique industries with the first ever Nuffield Scholars Conference held in Darwin.
Hundreds of scholars from across the globe travelled to the Top End to hear all about the potential, limitations and dreams for Northern Australia.

The Nuffield Scholar Foundation was launched in Britain in 1947 and since then, hundreds of farmers have been awarded the life-changing scholarship to travel overseas and study an agricultural topic of their choice.
Ashley Severin was the first ever Northern Territory recipient in 1986.
He and wife Lindy Severin run Curtin Springs Station in Central Australia and have successfully diversified by running a busy tourism operation, as well as setting up a paper mill to produce high-end stationary made out of the natural grasses and unique flora in the region.
"The landscape is just magnificent and cattle are in peak condition so can't ask much more than that".
Lyndee Severin said because of the advice they could seek through Nuffield Scholar they were willing to take greater gambles in their business.
"Whatever you are doing somebody has done more and bigger and taken bigger risk and survived doesn't always work and there are others at the end other end and sometimes there the most important to go well what happened."
Adam Coffey is a first generation pastoralist who has worked right across the Northern belt of Australia on various cattle stations, and was the 2016 Nuffield Scholar.
He used his funding to look at how better to rear tropical cattle and believes Northern producers need to focus more on intensifying land production rather than spreading cattle over vast tracts of land.
"I took a lot away from my travels through Brazil and South America and we hear so much about Brazil and their production powerhouses … and they are."

Dan Richards runs Humpty Doo Barramundi and the family business is one of the largest operations in the world.
He said he travelled from desert to ocean, including Saudi Arabia and Norway to better understand aquaculture industries in other big seafood producing countries.
"I used my opportunity to investigate if barramundi could be the white fish equivalent of salmon."

Another big push by the program is getting farmers to be better at telling their own stories in a world that's increasingly urbanised.
For first generation pastoralist Adam Coffey, the Nuffield is about getting the word out.
"We got to believe in what we do, we got to know what we do is right and we got to tell people about it," he said.


South Australian Treasurer Tom Koutsantonis has spent two days touring Tesla facilities in California ahead of Elon Musk's visit to Adelaide this week as part of the International Astronautical Congress.
The State Government announced a partnership with US company Tesla and entrepreneur Elon Musk to build a 100MW storage battery in the state's mid north earlier this year.
The battery is due to be in place by summer, and Mr Musk is expected to give an update on the project while in Adelaide later this week.
Mr Koutsantonis held a meeting on Thursday with Tesla executives at the company's Fremont factory, a former General Motors plant.
He then travelled to Nevada to tour the Gigafactory where elements of South Australia's big battery will be built.
"The management and staff have a real sense of excitement about our battery installation," Mr Koutsantonis said.
"South Australia is really at the cutting edge as we implement our energy plan to secure a cleaner, more affordable and more secure energy network."
Mr Koutsantonis also travelled to the United Kingdom where he toured a number of the Gupta Family Group's businesses.
The Gupta family owns GFG Alliance, which has bought the steelworks in Whyalla.
"It was fascinating to see the vertical integration of Sanjeev Gupta's businesses in the UK," Mr Koutsantonis said.
"From Formula One and A380 components to sheet steel rolling and biomass plant manufacturing, GFG and Simec have come a long way in the past 24 months."


China has announced it will limit oil supplies to North Korea under UN sanctions over its nuclear and missile development, further reducing support from Pyongyang's last major trading partner and diplomatic ally.

The Commerce Ministry said China, the North's main energy supplier, would ban all exports of liquified natural gas and condensates.
Exports of refined petroleum to the North will be limited to two million barrels per year from October 1, the Commerce Ministry said.
China does not disclose details of trade with the isolated North, so it was not immediately clear how large the possible reduction might be.
There will also be a ban on textile imports from the North, the ministry said.

Textiles are one of North Korea's last major sources of foreign revenue following repeated rounds of UN sanctions under which Beijing cut off purchases of coal, iron ore, seafood and other goods.
China accounts for some 90 per cent of the North's trade, making its cooperation critical to any efforts to derail Pyongyang's development of nuclear weapons and long-range missiles.
Until recently, China had propped up North Korea with a continuous supply of oil across the border and diplomatic protection.
They are reluctant to push Pyongyang too hard for fear the government might collapse, and argue against doing anything that might hurt ordinary North Koreans.
But Beijing is expressing increasing frustration with the actions of Kim Jong-un and has supported the latest rounds of UN Security Council sanctions.
Petroleum exports for use in the North's ballistic missile program or other activities are banned by UN sanctions, the Commerce Ministry said.
Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has welcomed the news, saying the rogue nation must be restricted.
"I have to say that China is showing a real commitment to work with the rest of the global community to bring this regime to its senses," he said.
"It is a reckless and dangerous regime that is essentially engaging in thuggery and standover tactics."
China's move comes days after US President Donald Trump ordered new sanctions on the hermit state and warned the US could "totally destroy" Pyongyang if it threatened the US or its allies.
The North called Mr Trump "deranged" and said the regime may consider testing a hydrogen bomb in the Pacific Ocean.

At a time when quality journalism appears to be under threat, a growing chorus has accused technology companies of succeeding at the expense of shrinking newsrooms.
Richard Gingras, the vice president of Google News, says the search giant is helping media companies move toward online subscription models and is ready to "engage" with Australian politicians in a looming Senate inquiry.
"People are coming into the market with new video services, with new video content. It is a very competitive environment.
"I just want to be careful in how we characterise that. This isn't Google's doing. It's the fact that we have a very rich and open marketplace for content."
"We helped 2 million publishers around the world with ad systems help drive revenue. But there's no question that the economics of news has changed."
"The big change in the last 25 years has been the introduction of the internet. The internet changed everything.
"In a sense, it's been what I like to think of as free expression brought to life — that's fabulous, right. I think everyone around the world has access to information and knowledge that they never had before.
"But it's also changed the marketplace for information. It's changed the marketplace for advertising."

"The market has changed. We're seeing great evidence of people that are more willing to subscribe to news products than we've seen before.
"We're also seeing more publishers putting up paywalls. That's a good step forward."
"News traffic went down and small publishers were hurt more than large publishers.
"Which only proved the point, that aggregation services have an amplifying effect on news audiences."
"We will certainly engage, I'm here this week, frankly talking to people in the public policy space.
"I'm sure we'll have many more conversations.
"We want to make sure that we have the opportunity to share our perspective, to make sure people understand our businesses and how they work."


London has stripped Uber of its licence to operate from the end of this month in a huge blow to the ride-booking app that will affect more than 40,000 drivers in one of the world's biggest cities.

Transport for London (TfL) said the ride-sharing app was not "fit and proper to hold a private hire operator license".
"TfL considers that Uber's approach and conduct demonstrate a lack of corporate responsibility in relation to a number of issues which have potential public safety and security implications," TfL said in a statement.
Uber, which is used by 3.5 million passengers in London, will see its current license expire on September 30.
The company said it plans to appeal the regulator's decision. It is able to continue operating until the appeals process is exhausted.
In its decision, TfL cited the company's approach to handling serious criminal offences and how it conducts background checks on its drivers.
TfL also took issue with software that could be used to block regulatory bodies from gaining full access to the app and "preventing officials from undertaking regulator or law enforcement duties".
London Mayor Sadiq Khan said he supported the decision, saying any operator of taxi services in the city "needs to play by the rules".
"Providing an innovative service must not be at the expense of customer safety and security," he said.
"I fully support TfL's decision — it would be wrong if TfL continued to license Uber if there is any way that this could pose a threat to Londoners' safety and security."
Uber shot back quickly in response, and accused the city of caving into special interests "who want to restrict consumer choice".
"This ban would show the world that, far from being open, London is closed to innovative companies who bring choice to consumers," the company said.

The decision does not effect Uber's associated food delivery service, UberEATS, a spokesperson confirmed, but shares in rival company Just Eat shot up on the back of the regulator's decision.
Police in London accused Uber last month of not reporting a sexual assault by a driver on a passenger, allowing the driver to strike again.
Metropolitan Police Inspector Neil Billany suggested in a letter that the company was putting concerns for its reputation over public safety.
Uber's aggressive corporate culture has resulted in litigation around the world.
The ride-booking app is now effectively banned in France, Spain and Belgium, and it is facing litigation and investigations around the world, a business expert said.
"There is a very long list of businesses who have suffered for failing to uphold the level of values necessary," said John Colley, a strategy professor at Warwick Business School.
"Until Uber gets this message then it will suffer lost trade as a result of its deteriorating reputation."

Papua New Guinea's Government has conceded it lost hundreds of millions of dollars on a controversial deal to buy a stake in Australian-listed oil and gas company Oil Search.
PNG Government-owned company Kumul Petroleum Holdings has sold its 10 per cent stake in Oil Search, closing a complicated and costly loan worth $1.2 billion.
"The board has made a commercial decision to divest itself of the Oil Search shares," chairman Sir Moi Avei said.
"My job as chairman is to protect the interests of Kumul Petroleum, nothing more than that."
The PNG Government took the loan from the Australian arm of Swiss bank UBS in 2014 to buy shares in Oil Search, a joint venture partner in PNG's biggest resources development, the $19 billion US PNG LNG project.
It controversially mortgaged its expected revenue from the project for the loan and did not pass legislation in Parliament enabling the transaction.
That failure to get parliamentary approval led to Prime Minister Peter O'Neill being referred to a leadership tribunal for allegedly failing to comply with "administrative and financial processes including the normal borrowing process".
But despite welcoming the tribunal as a chance to clear his name, Mr O'Neill fought the referral in the courts and the tribunal was not convened.
Mr O'Neill also sacked his Treasurer, Don Polye, for failing to support the loan and alleging it was illegal.
He promoted the deal as a win for PNG at the time.
"The purchase of these shares is an investment in the key resource infrastructure of our country," Mr O'Neill said in 2014.
But Oil Search's share price has since fallen by about 20 per cent.
The complicated — and confidential — nature of the loan makes it difficult to work out just how much money the Government lost, even for Kumul Petroleum Holdings managing director Wapu Sonk.
"That's a hard number to come up with at the moment," he said.
But Mr Sonk conceded the deal cost Kumul Petroleum at least $US254 million for the interest and payment of a bridging loan at the start of the deal.

Economist Paul Flanagan, a former adviser to the PNG Treasury, said the total loss would be much higher than that.
"We don't know the total cost of this poor decision to get the Government involved in what should always have been a private company matter," he said.
"But it would be running into many hundreds of millions of kina and this would have been money much better spent on areas of high priority such as health and education."
A key reason the PNG Government sold its shares was to avoid repaying the loan.
But Mr Flanagan said the Oil Search deal will still have long-term, negative implications for the country.
"There's been an extraordinary lack of transparency hiding behind the arguments that the loan agreements are commercial in confidence," he said.
"The people of PNG, the taxpayers of PNG, deserve a lot more transparency to know exactly what went on and for those involved in the initial decisions that have proven to be very poor decisions, there should be more scope to hold them to account."
The ABC sought a response from the PNG Prime Minister's Office, but was yet to hear back.


Iron ore and coal prices have continued to tumble as China was hit by a credit downgrade and fears demand for steel was falling.

The most heavily traded iron ore futures contract on the Dalian exchange was down another 3.4 per cent in afternoon trade, to be down more than 7 per cent for the week and 18 per cent off its recent peak a month ago.
Spot iron ore prices have fallen even more to about $US66 a tonne, its lowest level since May.
Another key component in steel making, coking coal, is down more than 10 per cent over the week, while futures trading in rebar steel — used in reinforced concrete and construction — has seen prices dip 5 per cent in recent days.
The latest bad news for the market was the big global credit ratings agency Standard and Poor's downgrading China's creditworthiness a notch to A+.
In announcing the downgrade, Standard and Poor's said China's economic and financial risks had increased after a prolonged period of strong credit growth.
Standard and Poor's downgrade follows a similar move by the other big ratings agencies Moody's and Fitch earlier this year.
An array of weaker data, including industrial production and infrastructure spending, as well as tighter credit conditions, dimmed sentiment in the commodity-dealing rooms throughout Asia.

On top of that, Chinese authorities demanded production cuts of up to 50 per cent in key steel-producing centres to reduce air pollution ahead of winter.
Credit Suisse recently forecast the slow down would translate to a 70-million-tonne drop in demand in the months ahead, leaving spot iron ore prices averaging about $US55 a tonne through to Christmas.
Rio Tinto's announcement that it would return the $US2.5 billion ($3.2 billion) proceeds from its Coal and Allied sale to shareholders through a buyback mitigated the damage on the ASX.
Rio shares edged up 1 per cent in early afternoon trade, while BHP was flat, although over the week both are down more than 1 per cent.


The scandal-plagued CommInsure brand could disappear over time as its new owner introduces new products, AIA Group regional chief executive Bill Lisle has conceded.

Speaking after the Commonwealth Bank announced the $3.8 billion sale of its troubled life insurance arm to the Hong Kong listed company, Mr Lisle confirmed fallout from the CommInsure scandal was an issue as the deal was hammered out.
"That was obviously a key part of the consideration," Mr Lisle said.
"But that was top of mind in the market for our board and our shareholders and we feel that CBA are taking the right course of action.
"We understood the reputational challenges.
"As you can imagine we did a lot of due diligence, we had independent third parties to investigate so we understood some of the challenges.
"But I think things will move along as they inevitably do."
Asked by the ABC if the CommInsure brand passed the "sniff test" for shareholders Mr Lisle said "absolutely — otherwise we would not have done the deal".
While the Commonwealth Bank said the CommInsure brand would be retained under a 20 year agreement for existing life products, Mr Lisle would not guarantee AIA's long-term commitment to the CommInsure name.
"We'll look at that as we move forward. I think it could depend on specific products," he said.
"But you would imagine over a five to 10 year period, just through normal product evolution, that products will change."
Mr Lisle responded cautiously when asked if AIA could be described as a "white knight" by assisting the CBA in offloaded the CommInsure life business.
"I'll leave it to you to comment on that. I couldn't. But what I will say is that we're very happy with the deal," Mr Lisle said.
The transition of CommInsure life products is expected to take three to four months. CommInsure will continue to offer general insurance products.
However, AIA's purchase of CommInsure Life will be subject to approval from the Foreign Investment Review Board.

Australia's regional banks are urging a Productivity Commission inquiry to tackle the growing market power and "too big to fail" nature of Australia's big four banks.

In a joint submission lodged today, regional banks call on the Federal Government to tell international ratings agencies it would be prepared to help all banks in the event of an economic crisis.
The Productivity Commission will be conducting a year-long probe into competition in the financial system.
It will look at whether the big four — Westpac, ANZ, CBA and the NAB — have an unfair advantage over smaller regional players though the Government's implicit guarantee for bank deposits.
Treasurer Scott Morrison hit the big banks with a controversial levy in the May budget, in a move that was welcomed by the smaller players as acknowledgement that major banks receive special funding advantages.
Bank of Queensland chief executive Jon Sutton singled out the implicit guarantee of bank deposits, which he said tilted the playing field in favour of the major banks by underpinning their credit rating.
"Because [major banks] are too big to fail and they are systemically important institutions in the financial landscape of Australia, they do enjoy a superior credit rating compared to a regional bank," he said.
"That implicit guarantee, some would say an explicit guarantee, means that they can access those funds cheaper.
"Ratings agencies look at that and the fact that the major banks enjoy a higher credit rating than regional banks, [which] means they get a funding benefit."


Earlier this year, S&P Global Ratings downgraded Australia's country risk assessment.
But ratings for major banks were left unchanged because of expectations that they would receive government backing in the event of a crisis, such as a housing correction.
However, because expected government support was not factored in, 23 financial institutions including Bank of Queensland and Bendigo and Adelaide Bank were downgraded.
Mr Sutton said despite the Government's push for greater competition, regional banks remained at a competitive disadvantage because of the systemic weight of major banks on the economy.
"If I lend you money for a home loan, you have the same risk characteristic as if one of the Big Four banks lent you the money," Mr Sutton said.
"But we have to put away $3.50 of capital for every dollar of that home loan, while a major bank only puts away $2 of capital.
"So therefore there is a significant gap between a big four bank and a regional bank."
Mr Sutton also warned that the outlook for rising interest rates — possibly two next year — could pressure highly leveraged households.
"We take our obligations very seriously to ensure that when our customers come to us to take out a loan, that they can pay it back," Mr Sutton said.
"We're in a very low interest rate environment and everyone needs to be mindful that if rates return to more normalised levels, what is the impact for households?"
The joint submission to the Productivity Commission has been lodged on behalf of Bank of Queensland, ME Bank, Bendigo & Adelaide Bank, Suncorp and AMP.
The inquiry has so far received 29 submissions, including ones from the Commonwealth Bank, the Reserve Bank, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority and the Australian Bankers Association.
Mr Morrison commissioned the inquiry on the recommendation of the Financial System Inquiry, led by former Commonwealth Bank chief executive David Murray.
The terms of reference said "the high concentration… in some parts of the Australian financial system has the potential to limit the benefits of competition in the future and should be proactively monitored over time".
The Productivity Commission has been scheduled to deliver its final report by July 2018.

What comes up must come down.
Sir Isaac Newton's oft-quoted law of gravity can also be applied to the movements of the US stock market.

After closing at "record highs" for days, Wall Street finished lower this morning with sell-offs across most industry sectors.
Eight out of 10 S&P sectors finished in negative territory, with telecommunications, healthcare and technology being among the bottom performers.
This follows the Federal Reserve's decision on Thursday, when it decided not to lift interest rates this month, but signalled there may be a rate hike by the end of the year.
The likelihood of an interest rate lift by December are about 70 per cent, according to CME's FedWatch tool.  Before the Fed release its monetary policy statement, the probability was lower at 51 per cent.
If that prediction comes true, it would be the third interest rate rise for America this year.
Apple's share price fell more than 1.7 per cent and were a major drag on the US stock market. This may be due to negative reports about its latest iPhone and smartwatch.
Investors are speculating that demand and pre-orders for the iPhone 8 will be underwhelming, compared to previous models.
According to , Apple conceded that its Apple Watch Series 3 has problems making phone calls and accessing data without an iPhone nearby — its most important features.
NVidia, Microsoft, and Procter & Gamble were also heavily sold-off.
In contrast, financials (+0.2pc) and industrials (+0.3pc) were the only sectors which ended the day with gains.
Shares of Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, and Bank of America all traded above 0.4 per cent.
With the sea of red in markets overnight, and an uninspiring lead from Wall Street, ASX futures have gained one-third of a per cent.
These mixed signals indicate the Australian share market may open flat this morning.
Commodity prices also plunged overnight, with gold falling to a one-month low of $1,291 an ounce.
Iron ore plunged by 5 percent overnight to $US66.09 dollars per tonne — its lowest level since July — as concerns about China's future demand for Australia's key export persist.
In addition, the local currency has fallen below the very-high 80 US cent mark, with one Australian dollar now worth 79.3 US cents.
The Australian dollar began to weaken after a speech by Reserve Bank governor Philip Lowe's speech on Thursday, which the market interpreted as "dovish".
Dr Lowe noted that overseas economies beginning to raise their interest rates.
"This has no automatic implications for monetary policy in Australia," he said.
The RBA governor also indicated that Australian interest rates will remain at low (at 1.5 per cent) in the meantime.
"Aussie financials will continue to be a key driver of the ASX 200," IG Market's chief market strategist Chris Weston said.
"And it's clear all the recent talk of potential rate hikes in 2018 from the RBA is not good for banks."


The loss of a small town's biggest employer might be enough to bring some communities to their knees, but not Ravensthorpe in Western Australia's south-east.
It has had plenty of practise weathering the boom/bust cycles of both mining and agriculture, and while some residents are packing their bags, many say they are not going anywhere.
Low nickel prices prompted First Quantum Minerals (FQM) to announce last month it would be mothballing its nickel mine.
The Toronto-based mining giant employed about 270 people at the Ravensthorpe mine, and the closure follows devastating floods which swept through the area earlier this year.
But this is not the first time, or even the second time, Ravensthorpe has been hit by a mine closure — this time residents were prepared.
Former FQM worker Jason Jones, who now farms near Hopetoun, said the company's announcement did not come as a surprise.

He said unlike the sudden BHP shut down in 2008, local people could see the First Quantum mine was struggling long before the announcement to put it into care and maintenance.
"The closure of the mine was not a huge shock, a lot of people have positioned themselves for it," Mr Jones said
He also said agriculture had long been the backbone of the local economy and the prospects of a good cropping season had buoyed the community.
As president of the Southerners Sporting Association, Mr Jones watched the steady decline of mine workers in the local football hockey and netball teams.
But he said the sporting groups would find ways to carry on.
"With the mine closing we will lose a lot of sponsorship, but in saying that our local businesses support us just as much," Mr Jones said.
"I view [the future] very positively. Agriculture and tourism underpin it.
"I like to think that we as a community can support each other. If there's big players in town so be it, but we are bigger than them anyway."
Sue Leighton was involved with BHP's initial opening up of the nickel mine in 2007.
A decade on, and with the mine shutting down for a second time, she also believed the long-term future of Ravensthorpe and Hopetoun rested with agriculture and tourism.
Ms Leighton is an organiser of the Ravensthorpe Wildflower Show.
She said thousands of people travel to the area for its unique flora, and there have been record visitor numbers to this year's show, which ends on Saturday.
"We've already got bookings from tour buses for next year for tourists to come to our wildflower show, so it's really important [as] they always spend a bit of money in town," she said.
"I always think farming goes up and down, mining comes and goes, wildflowers are here forever and that's our future, eco tourism."

Ravensthorpe Shire chief executive Ian Fitzgerald said there was no doubt the floods and the mine closure made for a tough year for the area.
It is estimated 30 children would leave the Hopetoun Primary School at the end of this term.
"I think over the next six weeks we'll feel the impact of those leaving the community, as school goes into holiday mode and people take the opportunity to move if they need to," Mr Fitzgerald said.
However, it wasn't all bad news.
"First Quantum keeping a care and maintenance crew on of 15 to 20 people will be good for the community," he said.
Stronger prices for lithium have also given the area a boost.
Some of the nickel mine workers have moved over to Galaxy Resources' lithium mine, just north of Ravensthorpe.
Galaxy closed Mt Cattlin in 2013, but reopened it several years later on the back of stronger lithium prices.

Mine manager Brian Talbot said the company had made it a policy to hire as many Ravensthorpe and Hopetoun residents as possible — with locals making up more than 80 per cent of Galaxy's staff at the site.
"Our mandate as a company is to employ local, and if we can't employ local then to relocate them to be local," he said.
"Ravensthorpe feels very positive to be part of the lithium boom and for a small town like Ravensthorpe to be part of that in the future sounds quite exciting and I think the people can feel that."
The State Government said at the time of FQM's announcement it would seek to assist those who were to be laid off.
Mines and Petroleum Minister Bill Johnston will visit the area this weekend to meet Shire of Ravensthorpe representatives, First Quantum Minerals management and workers.


Fossil beer is the latest innovation for a South Australian brewer, as more craft beer makers get creative to stand out in a crowded market.
Kangaroo Island brewer Mike Holden is set to release a 'shale ale' beer, commemorating 10 years of fossil research on the South Australian island.
Mr Holden said the ale was filtered through fossil-rich shale that was more than half a billion years old.
"We just thought for this one, why not let the millions of years of shale rock speak for itself and see what comes through?" he said.
"The beer definitely has a unique flavour to it, but it is not something that is off-putting or maybe something that people will not even recognise."

Kangaroo Island is known as prime hunting ground for palaeontologists, with researchers finding 500-million-year-old "alien-looking" fossils in 2014.

This year marks a decade of fossil digging at the island's Emu Bay for University of New England professor John Paterson and his University of Adelaide colleague Diego Garcia-Bellido.
Over the past 10 years, it is estimated the team has collected about 6,000 specimens for the South Australian Museum.
Professor Paterson said the shale used as part of the brew was estimated to be about 514 million years old.
"They are from a very special time in Earth's history called the Cambrian … this is when we started to see the first marine animals appearing on Earth," he said.
"What we are digging up is some of the oldest marine animals on the planet.
"We get very fine preservation, even down to finding muscle tissues and the lenses within the eyes of some of these strange arthropod creatures."
Australia's craft beer industry is growing at a rapid rate, with an estimated 400-plus craft brewers now plying their trade.

Independent Brewers Association executive officer Chris McNamara said producers were finding their niche through the idea of beers with backstories or a sense of place.
"It is a crowded marketplace out there at the moment, and is getting more crowded by the day," he said.
"Small brewers are an innovative mob, so they are always looking for a different spin to put on their beer."
Mr Holden agreed, saying many consumers could establish a rapport with particular drinks based on their backstory.
"People enjoy the story of beer," he said.
"We have always tried to make sure there is a link in our beers to where we are.
"The story is there, and people can either choose to just drink a beer like it is anything else, or get involved and learn something about it as well."


As Australia and Indonesia edge closer to securing a bilateral trade deal, a lack of confidence in each other has been one of the major barriers.

That is according to Indonesia's chief trade negotiator Iman Pambagyo, who in an interview with the ABC, said more political will and guidance from the leaders of the two countries will be needed for an agreement to be secured.
He said Australia would also need to open its doors to Indonesian workers.
"I think between now and then it seems that we lack confidence in each other," Mr Pambagyo, the director-general for International Trade Negotiations, said.
"But I think with the visit between the two ministers the atmosphere is getting better and better."
Trade Minister Steve Ciobo was in Jakarta this week for the 17th meeting with his Indonesian counterpart Enggartiaso Lutika.
The ministers announced a new self-imposed November deadline for the deal, a month earlier than had previously been outlined, but neither would comment on the details of negotiations.
Both countries say it will be a "win, win" agreement, but that can only be tested once the details are unveiled.
It is hard to fathom that Indonesia will give too much away; the nation has always been protectionist and President Joko Widodo has done nothing to rid the country of that reputation.
In fact, since he came to the presidency in 2014, import tariffs on a range of goods have been increased.
"I should admit that we sometimes send the wrong signal to our partners not only to Australia but to our negotiating partners," Mr Pambagyo said.
The chief negotiator said a key element of the deal for Indonesia would be training for Indonesian workers across a range of sectors including health, tourism and IT.
For instance, the training of Indonesian nurses would take place in Australia, although there was concern how it would succeed unless they had strong English skills.
"I understand that it might be quite challenging for Australia to just open its doors to our workers to work in Australia but I think we can find some ways to deal with it," he said.

Whether what eventuates is a "free" trade deal in the true sense is unlikely, both Governments prefer to stick to the official, clunky title the "Indonesia-Australia Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement", or IA-CEPA.
Already Australia has removed altogether the tariff on herbicides and pesticides coming from Indonesia, while Indonesia will reduce to 5 per cent a tariff on Australian raw sugar.
Two-way trade between Australia and Indonesia is remarkably low at around $15 billion.
Indonesia, a nation of 250 million people, is Australia's 12th-largest trading partner.
Mr Pambagyo could not quantify by how much the deal would boost the dollar figure, and said the focus should be more on investment and people-to-people links than on the trading of goods.
"We have to find the right button for the negotiators to accelerate the process of negotiation," he said of the trade talks.
The deal, regardless of detail, will be seen as a significant step in the bilateral relationship and a sign of it strengthening.


Hundreds of the world's brightest young scientists and students have descended upon Adelaide this week for the 16th Space Generation Congress, an annual gathering of budding space professionals under 35.
NASA and the European Space Agency are also in attendance, outlining their bold plans for the future and, according to at least one scientist, creating a level of interest amongst the wider community not seen in years.
"Because space exploration is a long-term kind of vision of things, you have to actually engage the young people," said Jason Crusan, director of Advanced Exploration Systems at NASA.
"You're seeing a resurging interest in public support for doing the hard things."
The Space Generation Congress (SGC) is being run as a curtain raiser to the International Astronautical Congress, which gets underway next week.

Some of the largest space agencies and companies, including Elon Musk's SpaceX, are in attendance.
The three-day SGC gathering is about exposing young professionals to the cosmic challenges facing humanity and introducing them to the career prospects which lie ahead.
"The technology has finally gotten to a point and the economics are there for a lot of activities," he said.
"Right now, we're in production of the our next-generation launch vehicles and crew transportation systems and what's exciting to me is that we're building the infrastructure and the spaceships which will take us out into deep space.
"It's always been 20 years away. But we actually have real contracts, real hardware being developed for these systems today."
For the next few days, students and young professionals will be learning from space agencies at the cosmic coalface.
They include the European Space Agency, which is leading workshops on the prospects of commercializing the moon by encouraging non-space industry to develop lunar programs.

NASA is outlining its plans to get humanity off our orb, including a manned mission to Mars in the 2030s.
"At the end of the day we want to be able to go anywhere, anytime we want to go," Mr Crusan said.
"That means places like the moon or Mars or even fly-bys of Venus."
With emerging private operators like Amazon founder Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin, NASA believes that the growing commercial space industry has a big role to play in getting us into deep space.
"We want to utilise that entire industrial base to send humans out into the solar system for the first time," Mr Crusan said.

As to the most fundamental question as to why leave the Earth at all, Mr Crusan was both philosophical and pragmatically practical.
"If we stop doing the hard things, I think we stop being human," he said.
"Space is one of those things that inspires people to do hard things."
He quickly added that any breakthroughs navigating the solar system would deliver rewards on our pale blue dot.
"[Space enthusiasts] go into other fields. They make the next medical breakthrough, the next agricultural breakthrough, and that goes towards solving all those hard problems here."


Almost six months to the day since Tropical Cyclone Debbie hit north Queensland, the region is poised for the arrival of another force of nature — British superstar Elton John.
Sir Elton will play tonight in Mackay and next Saturday in Cairns, with performances in Wollongong and Hobart in between.

The four dates are the 70-year-old singer's only public shows on his Australian tour, which is largely sold out but now has limited tickets in some locations.
Fifteen thousand visitors are expected at tonight's Mackay performance, with 5,000 of that number travelling from outside the region, including 200 from overseas.


Mackay Mayor Greg Williamson said the Once In A Lifetime tour would generate more than $4 million for the local economy.
The city has unveiled a permanent Yellow Brick Road mural in tribute to the performer's 1970s album, and will kick on with an Elton-themed street party on Saturday.
The road to the stadium, once called Casey Ave, has been renamed Elton John Drive.
"[The mural] is going to be a lasting legacy and we hope it's going to be here for decades, to just prove the fact that Elton was here in Mackay for a once in a lifetime event in 2017," Cr Williamson said.
"All of the things that are happening for this week, I've got to say we are extremely proud because this is a fantastic Mackay event."

Superfan Vicky Crichton studied Elton John trivia for 10 days to win two front row tickets to the show, which happens to be the night before her birthday.
Ms Crichton from Sarina, south of Mackay, said she had loved Elton John since she was a girl singing along to Crocodile Rock with her sisters.

"I grew up with him and just love his music," she said.
"The only other chance I ever had he came to Townsville … but I had young children then and it just wasn't the right time and I was absolutely heartbroken.
"I swore that if I ever, ever got another chance to see Elton anywhere in the world I would, and it just so happened that it popped up in my backyard.
"It was just meant to be, the night of my birthday, it all just came together."
Ms Crichton prepared 18 written pages of notes for a competition held by a local radio station, where she had to answer questions about the singer's past albums, family, and charity work.
"I knew a lot about him but when I realised there were two front row tickets available I went into Google overdrive," she said.
"I was pretty highly strung. I had all these Elton questions going around my head for 10 days. I was off the planet probably."

Sir Elton's tour promoter Matthew Lazarus-Hall said the singer wanted to tour places he had never played in before.
"He loves being different and he loves performing, so when we sat down on the last tour and worked out what we wanted to do, he was like 'This is a great idea, let's do it'," he said.
"I've worked on a lot of Elton shows and I've never seen a dud one, so he will give this 120 per cent, it will be fantastic, it'll be a lot of the hits, and you're in for a great time."
He will be on stage for two-and-a-half hours from 8:00pm, with Australian band Busby Marou as the support act.


As power prices continue to surge, Australians believe household solar storage batteries are the key to cheaper and more reliable energy, according to a new poll of 2,000 households.

The Climate Council found nearly three-quarters of those surveyed believe batteries, coupled with solar systems, would become commonplace within 10 years.
Of those who already had solar systems, 68 per cent were considering adding a household storage battery.
Most said the primary motivation for buying a solar battery was to reduce power bills.
Only 6 per cent believed consumers were driven by the need to protect their homes from blackouts.

"It shows that Australians do understand that renewables — particularly solar and increasingly battery storage — provide a solution to high power prices," the Climate Council's Andrew Stock said.
"I think it's very encouraging that Australians really do get the importance of new technology. There is very little appetite for keeping aging coal fire stations running in the Australian populace, frankly," he said.


New South Wales resident Murray Green installed a home battery last year.
"Right now, it's not really worth it to feed the electricity back into the grid so using the battery to store the power and then consume it yourself, it just seemed like a better way to use the solar panels," he said.
"Power prices are going up and so it makes sense to try to reduce the amount of power you're buying from the grid. I think now for me, the higher the prices go, the sooner the system will pay off."
"It protects us against price rises in the future."
The price of storage batteries in the first half of 2017 only dropped by 5 per cent on the back of a significant fall at the end of last year.
Consultancy firm Sunwiz founder Warwick Johnston said while the number of battery installations had doubled from last year, many people were waiting for the price of batteries to drop significantly.
"We expect to see a price reduction of 30 per cent in the next couple of years," Mr Johnston said.
It's currently estimated to take 10 years to pay back the initial outlay for a solar and storage system, with batteries only having a decade-long shelf life.
Mr Johnston said he expected there would be a surge in uptake when it took only seven years to recoup the cost of the battery.

Andrew Stock, who has more than 40 years of experience in the energy industry, said in some areas people should not wait for the price to drop.
"In some states that have high power prices, analysis shows it's economical now to install batteries. Sunny states like South Australia and Queensland have relatively high power prices, so its quite economic to install battery systems," Mr Stock said.

"It is many, many times more expensive to import [electricity] so if you can install batteries, if they are modest in size and you have solar on your roof, that will allow you to offset that expensive power you draw from the grid," he said.
Energy economist and director of Carbon and Energy Markets, Bruce Mountain, agreed South Australians would benefit from installing batteries sooner rather than later.
"That is simply because battery and solar prices have come down, and in South Australia energy prices have gone up so much," Mr Mountain said.
Mr Mountain said he wanted the Federal Government to invest more in the local industry to bring down solar battery costs, instead of seeking to subsidise coal fire power generators like Liddell.
"They can accelerate the installation of these batteries, they can grow a local equipment suppliers and often than incentive creates new industry and scale economies," Mr Mountain said.
"The household would benefit, but the system as a whole would benefit as well, because a household of battery and solar gives to the grid a far more stable demand," he said.


Fairfax Media has warned that its revenues are down 4-5 per cent on last year's levels, as it prepares to reveal its Domain separation plan as early as Friday.
In a statement to the share market, the struggling media company reported falling revenue for all parts of its business, except the real estate advertising arm that is about to be split-off.
The worst decline in revenue was for metro media — which includes the company's major mastheads, The Age, The Sydney Morning Herald and the Australian Financial Review — where gross earnings are down 11 per cent so far this financial year compared to last.
Australian Community Media, the local newspapers division, has seen a 10 per cent revenue slide.
Stuff, the New Zealand media division, has also seen revenues fall 10 per cent, while the Macquarie Media radio division has reported a 4 per cent drop in earnings.
The only part of the business to observe revenue growth was Domain, where gross earnings rose 13 per cent on the back of a 22 per cent rise in digital revenue.
However, even there, costs were expected to be up 13 per cent on last financial year's $206 million, excluding any additional costs related to Domain's separation from the rest of the company.
Fairfax said it made Thursday's updated financial disclosure ahead of "the potential lodgement" of details about the Domain separation with the ASX on September 22.
The company said Thursday's financial update will replace the usual disclosure provided at the annual general meeting, which will be on November 2.
Fairfax said it is continuing to implement cost saving measures across the group.


The South Australian Government says it wants to capitalise on the fast-growing multi-billion dollar business around space, announcing the creation of a South Australian Space Industry Centre.
The Government said the centre (SASIC) would help to fuel space industry innovation, encourage start-ups and create high-tech jobs.
The announcement comes ahead of the International Astronautical Congress which is being held in Adelaide next week, with some of the largest space agencies and companies — including NASA and SpaceX — to be in attendance.
"We know that the space industry in this country and around the world is growing at about three times the rate of growth [of] the rest of the growth in the world economy," Premier Jay Weatherill said.
"The eyes of the world will be on South Australia next week."
The congress is expected to attract 3,500 delegates from across the world, including some very high-profile guests.
"At the end of the week, we'll also hear from Elon Musk. He'll update [us] in relation to his Mars program," the Premier said.
SASIC will be run alongside Defence SA, and the State Government hopes it will soon be part of a national space agency.
The centre will provide grants of $1 million per year to develop local space businesses, and encourage research and development.

As part of this week's cabinet reshuffle, the Government created an expanded portfolio to include both Defence and Space Industries.
Mr Weatherill acknowledged the "important connection" between "our defence industries and space industries", but also outlined the benefits for the local economy.
"It's not just about rockets and astronauts," he said.
"All of those things can provide incredibly important things for terrestrial uses."
Mr Weatherill said data that would be useful to farmers was one such use, and was also talking up the state's history in rocketry and satellites.
"South Australia 50 years ago launched its first rocket from the Woomera rocket range," he said.
"We're one of the first three countries in the world to launch a satellite from its own territory."
South Australia and the ACT have joined forces to spearhead a campaign to develop a national space agency, signing a memorandum of understanding in August.
The NT and WA Governments have also expressed an interest to sign up.

Mr Weatherill has also acknowledged rumours the Prime Minister may be a surprise at next week's conference, and said that might be a good sign of an imminent announcement.
"We've written to the Prime Minister to create a national space agency … we're encouraging him to make an announcement to that end," Mr Weatherill said.
"There has been some speculation of the Prime Minister himself turning up. He'd be very welcome.
"You'd imagine he's not going to turn up to say very little."
Despite prominent calls from scientists, including Adelaide-born astronaut Dr Andrew Thomas, a federal review into a proposal to develop an Australian Space Agency isn't expected back for at least six months.
"The review should now focus on the shape and form of that agency," Mr Weatherill said.
The Premier said he hoped the creation of SASIC, and the MOU between SA and the ACT, would show the Commonwealth the state was serious about conquering the cosmos.
"We want to put a tangible investment in place so we can say, with some credibility, we want to be your partner in the establishment of a national space agency," he said.


Reserve Bank governor Philip Lowe is optimistic Australia's economy is on the path to a new post-mining growth phase, despite the challenges of weak wages growth, record-and-still-rising debt, and looming interest rate increases.
Speaking in Perth about "the next chapter" in Australia's economic development, Dr Lowe said the mining investment downturn was almost over, but Australia would need to look for new innovate industries to compete globally.
"If we are to take advantage of the opportunities that are offered by technology and growth in Asia, we need a flexible workforce with strong skills in the areas of problem solving, critical thinking and communication," he advised.
"Investment in human capital will be one of the keys to success."
The most positive sign is that investment in non-human capital — that is equipment, machinery, buildings and infrastructure — has now turned a corner, growing 10 per cent outside the mining sector over the past year.
"For a number of years, animal spirits had been missing, with many firms preferring to put off making decisions about capital spending," Dr Lowe observed.
"It appears that some of this reluctance to invest is now passing."
That fed through to strong employment growth, with the number of people with jobs growing by 2.5 per cent over the past year, easily exceeding population growth.
However, even though full-time employment is growing, it is not flowing through to pay increases.
"Over the past four years, the increase in average hourly earnings has been the slowest since at least the mid-1960s," Dr Lowe said.
"This is partly a consequence of the unwinding of the mining boom but there are structural factors at work as well.
"The slow growth in wages is putting a strain on household budgets and contributing to low rates of inflation."
The other big strain on household budgets and spending is a record level of household — mainly housing — debt, which is now more than 190 per cent of household incomes.
"Australians are coping well with the higher level of debt, but as debt levels have increased relative to our incomes so too have the medium-term risks," Dr Lowe said.
One of those risks is rising interest rates, as global central banks unwind their post-financial-crisis emergency stimulus programs.
"This period of monetary expansion is now drawing to a close," Dr Lowe said.
"Periods of rising interest rates globally have, historically, exposed over-borrowing somewhere in the global system.
"Investment strategies that looked sensible when interest rates were very low tend not to look so good when interest rates are higher."
While the global rise in interest rates has started in the US, Dr Lowe warned Australia would not be immune, although it may have a grace period.
"An increase in global interest rates would, over time, be expected to flow through to us, just as the lower interest rates have," he said.
"Our flexible exchange rate though gives us considerable independence regarding the timing as to when this might happen."
The other big constraint on the Reserve Bank raising rates too far, too fast is the level of household debt itself.
"Having increased their borrowing, households are less inclined to let consumption growth run ahead of growth in incomes for too long," Dr Lowe observed.
"Higher levels of debt also mean that household spending could be quite sensitive to increases in interest rates, something the Reserve Bank will be paying close attention to."
Dr Lowe concluded by saying the Reserve Bank had not attempted to "overly fine tune" the economy in recent years through interest rate moves, implying it would wait for stronger signs of economic improvement before it started lifting interest rates.


The consultation process for deciding which route the Melbourne-to-Brisbane inland railway would take in southern Queensland was "a complete farce", according to local farmers.

Federal Infrastructure Minister Darren Chester today announced the railway's path would go across floodplains north of the New South Wales border.
The chosen route is similar to the alignment known as the "base case" proposed by the Australian Rail and Track Corporation (ARTC) in 2010.
There had been four routes under consideration. Earlier this year, Mr Chester established the Project Reference Group (PRG) to address landholder concerns about the options and to allow local input.
One of the key objectives of the group, as outlined by the Federal Government, was to achieve "transparency" in decision making.
But local floodplain farmer Brett Kelly said the selection process lacked transparency.
"The PRG process was a complete farce in that we did not get any input, we could not question any of the engineering," he said.

The grain grower said group members didn't get to see the PRG's final report before the decision was made, and has labelled it a public relations exercise.
"At the end of the consultation process and the PRG process, the chairman wrote a report to Minister Chester," Mr Kelly said.
"We were not allowed to see a copy of that, which removes the transparency that we were promised with the process."
Mr Chester released the report last night to members of the PRG, at the same time as he notified them of the decision on the route.
"People are going to be disappointed by the decision if it impacts them directly, but the process has been absolutely above board," the Minister said. "I stand by the process."
Mr Kelly and another floodplain farmer, Jason Mundt, said they had been told by ARTC the line would be built on a two-metre embankment with culverts.

The farmers are concerned drains under the tracks could get blocked with debris, creating a damming effect that could be "catastrophic" and "put lives at risk".
Mr Kelly also said there was little information on what engineering had been done to ensure flood risks would be mitigated.
"We did not get any input, we could not question any of the engineering," he said.
"We couldn't ask them [the engineers] to elaborate why all of a sudden this base case line was cheaper, when, according to the [2015] SMEC [Snowy Mountain Electricity Corporation] report, it was actually dearer than other routes."
Speaking in Queensland today, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull ensured landowners would not be put in danger.
"It obviously goes across a floodplain but the engineering measures and design will take all that into account so that it does not adversely affect either property owners or environment interests by changing the way water flows," Mr Turnbull said.
Farmers are also concerned vested interests may have attempted to influence the decision-making process on the route.
"I believe our mayor could profit in the tens of millions of dollars from the route going on this base case line," Mr Kelly said.
"He obviously has a large quarry that he can profit out of by supplying the ballast that will go underneath this railway line.
"Out of all the routes, the most ballast that would be needed would be underneath this particular route."
Toowoomba Regional Council Mayor Paul Antonio has championed inland rail for many years and has spoken publicly in support of the base case.
He owns a gravel quarry near Millmerran on the route chosen by the Federal Government.
In an interview with the ABC, Councillor Antonio conceded he stood to benefit from inland rail.
"Regardless of where the rail line goes over the next 100 years, that basalt on my hill will be used. It will benefit either myself or whoever owns that property," he said.
The ABC can reveal the Mayor personally paid $4,900 to have another option investigated — it altered the base case route near Millmerran and took the line to the very edge of his quarry.
Cr Antonio said he paid for the map to find an alternative that did not go through prime agricultural land in Millmerran, to help affected farmers.

After initially telling the ABC he gave the map only to one Millmerran farmer, he later conceded he provided the map to former industry minister Ian MacFarlane, who is now the chief executive of the Queensland Resources Council.
"Ian's a friend of mine and he has some influence in terms of protection of good agricultural land," the Mayor said.
He added he did not know what Mr Macfarlane did with the map.
However, the ABC has obtained a text message sent by Cr Antonio on September 11 to Millmerran farmer Russell Stevens that contradicts this.
"Macfarlane said he had been talking to the powers that be and they liked the option. Enormous advantage," the text said.
Mr Macfarlane did not respond to the ABC's questions about the map, however he said he was not lobbying for Cr Antonio.
Cr Antonio's proposed diversion is not part of the route announced by Mr Chester today.
But Mr Stevens, whose farm may be dissected by the route, said it was concerning the mayor appeared to have tried to influence the outcome.
"I think it's just disgraceful actually," he said.
"If they want to come through here they will drag me off here in handcuffs and a paddy wagon. I am not going."
Mr Chester today disagreed with any suggestion there had been political manipulation in the selection process.



Artist Yoko Ono has forced a Polish beverage company to rename its new drink, called John Lemon, after threatening legal action.
The widow of Beatles great John Lennon alleged the soft drink infringed on the trademark of her late husband and his rights.
The company has now agreed to change the drink's name to On Lemon, reaching a settlement so that they could continue their business.
Karol Chamera, the founder of Mr Lemonade Alternative Drinks, which distributed the John Lemon beverage in the UK, told the East London Advertiser newspaper that they could not afford to keep up the battle.
"All of us involved with this product are start-ups and we couldn't take on someone who is worth many, many millions," she said.
Lawyers acting for Ono wrote to distributors warning the company faced costs of up to 5,000 euros ($7,401) a day and 500 euros ($739) for every bottle sold if they infringed the trademark.

Lawyers acting for the beverage firm denied it had infringed the late star's rights.
But Ono's lawyers pointed to a Facebook post from John Lemon Ireland, which featured an image of the iconic singer.
Other marketing materials included the brand's logo next to the words "let it be" and a pair of round glasses, both closely associated with Lennon.
John Lemon's lawyers pointed out that their EU trademark had been registered in 2014, two years earlier than the John Lennon trademark, which was registered in 2016.

Global stock markets were on edge as they awaited the outcome of the Federal Reserve's two-day meeting.

US and European equities finished with mixed performances by the end of their trading days.
The main safe-haven asset, gold, has fallen sharply (-0.8pc), reversing earlier gains, following the Fed's policy announcement.
The Fed decided to keep American interest rates on hold at 1-1.25 per cent, as widely predicted.
But the American central bank was more "hawkish" than expected, as it signalled its expectations of another rate hike by the end of the year — despite recent weak inflation figures.

"What we need to figure out is whether the factors that have lowered inflation are likely to prove persistent," Fed chair Janet Yellen said at a press conference after the meeting.
Ms Yellen said that, if they do, "it would require an alteration of monetary policy".
A majority of the bank's officials (11 out of 16) see the "appropriate" level for the federal funds rate to be between 1.25 per cent and 1.5 per cent by the end of the year, the Fed's post-meeting economic projections revealed. That is 0.25 percentage points above the current level.
"The market reaction to the Fed has been to lift the probability of a December rate hike to around two-thirds from the 50/50 proposition prices yesterday," said Deutsche Bank strategist Ken Crompton.

As expected, the Fed also said it will gradually begin reversing its bond buying (or quantitative easing) from October.
Since the global financial crisis, the bank has attempted to stimulate US economic growth with a massive cash injection.
This has resulted in it now holding about $US4.2 trillion worth of government bonds and mortgage-backed securities on its balance sheet.
The Fed's plan is to get rid of a modest $US10 billion worth of those assets each month to start with, ramping up to $US50 billion in a year's time.

Capital Economics' US economist Andrew Hunter is sceptical about how effective the Fed's "quantitative tightening" plan will be.
"In truth, however, the move has been so well telegraphed and, at just $US10 billion per month initially, the pace of run-down will be so gradual that it is unlikely to have a major impact on the economy or financial markets," he said.
"Indeed, based on the Fed's current plans, the balance sheet would still be as large as $US3 trillion in four years' time."
Following the Fed's announcement, the Dow Jones and S&P 500 indexes rose slightly to hit fresh records.
However, the Nasdaq slipped by 0.1 per cent as it was dragged down by the technology sector (-0.5 per cent), one of the day's underperformers.
Most US stock sectors ended the day either negative or flat — with the exception of the energy sector (+0.7 per cent). Energy stocks received a boost from an overnight surge in crude prices (+2 per cent).
It looks to be a quiet day, with no major local economic data out today.
ASX futures have risen by 0.1 per cent, pointing towards a slightly higher open for the local bourse.
The Australian dollar surged to 80.87c overnight, but that was short-lived. The local currency has now backtracked to 80.25 US cents.


The Commonwealth Bank has sold its troubled insurance business CommInsure Life to a Hong Kong-listed group for $3.8 billion.

The deal with AIA Group also covers the sale of the CBA's New Zealand life insurance arm Sovereign.
The sale of CommInsure Life follows a scandal where the insurer was accused of using outdated medical definitions to delay or deny payments to policyholders, and pressuring medical assessors to reject claims.
As part of the CommInsure and Sovereign sale, the CBA also announced its head of wealth management Annabel Spring will leave the company in December.
Ms Spring had oversight for the CommInsure business and was under constant criticism as CBA managed the scandal after an investigation by the ABC's Four Corners and Fairfax Media.
The sale of CommInsure had been flagged in CBA's full-year results last month although, at the time, the company said the future sale of the insurer was uncertain.
The purchase by AIA includes a 20-year partnership agreement to continue providing insurance products to customers in Australia and New Zealand.

In a statement released to the stock exchange, the CBA confirmed that CommInsure and Sovereign customers will retain current benefits in existing policies.
AIA is the largest publicly listed insurance group in Asia and already has established life insurance businesses in Australia and New Zealand.
Under the sale, the CBA will continue to earn income from its life insurance products already in place.
CBA will also retain the CommInsure brand and continue to sell general insurance under it.
At the same time as announcing the sale of its life insurance business, CBA also announced a strategic review of its funds management business, Colonial First State Global Asset Management.
The sale of CommInsure Life and Sovereign will end up in a $300 million loss for CBA, but also release about $3 billion of capital for the bank.
The banking regulator APRA earlier this year released increased capital requirements to take effect at the start of 2020, with analysts estimating that CBA would have at least a $4 billion shortfall under the new rules if it did not raise more funds.
APRA has also hinted that it will require the major banks to hold more capital — which is the reserves of funds they can reliably draw on to cover potential losses — in relation to residential mortgages.

Citi bank analyst Craig Williams said the CommInsure sell-off now means Commonwealth Bank can meet APRA's 2020 requirements, but it may need to raise more money if it cops a large fine over money laundering law breaches.
"A large fine accrued in settling the AUSTRAC legal action may take CBA below this minimum threshold again, albeit a sale or IPO of the Global Asset Management business (now subject to strategic review) is likely to release sufficient capital to eliminate any shortfall," he wrote in a note.
It is not yet clear how much CBA's review of Colonial is related to raising additional capital through a sale or initial public offering (IPO) — separate share market listing — of the wealth management business.
It is possible that CBA could ultimately decide not to proceed, or to give its existing shareholders the equity in a standalone firm.
With $219 billion of funds under management, Colonial is one of Australia's largest asset managers.
To give a very rough sense of its potential standalone value on the share market, listed fund manager Platinum Investment Management is currently valued at $3.6 billion, and Colonial is almost ten times bigger in terms of assets under management.
However, Platinum makes a lot more profit on each of those dollars under management — it reported a $186 million net profit for the 2017 financial year.
Based on the Colonial First State Global Asset Management division's profits of $229 million in CBA's last annual report, it seems a market valuation between $3.5-4.5 billion may be closer to the mark, at 15-20 times its earnings.
Commonwealth Bank chief executive Ian Narev was putting a positive spin on offloading its insurance business given the scandals that damaged the reputation of CommInsure.
"Providing our customers with access to high quality products and services for all their financial needs is core to our vision of securing and enhancing financial wellbeing," Mr Narev said in a statement.
"We have said for some time that while distributing life insurance is a fundamental part of that strategy, we were open to different models for doing so."
The fallout from CommInsure comes as CBA deals with the latest scandal involving almost 54,000 alleged breaches of anti-money laundering regulations.
As a result, CBA chairman Catherine Livingstone ordered that the bank's executive team including Ian Narev have their short term bonuses cut to zero.

Succession planning for Ian Narev's replacement has been expedited and Mr Narev will leave the CBA by 30 June 2018.
Commenting on Annabel Spring's confirmed departure, Mr Narev said Ms Spring had led the CBA's insurance arm during "challenging and changing times" for the insurance industry.
"She has shown determined leadership in addressing complex and long-standing issues in the businesses while growing and transforming the businesses culturally, technologically and strategically," Mr Narev said.
The Commonwealth Bank's share price has suffered as a result of the most recent scandal involving money laundering allegations closing yesterday at $76.29 after reaching more than $93 in March 2015.
CBA is facing an investigation into its culture and governance by a panel of independent experts assembled by the bank regulator APRA.
However, APRA has faced criticism from banking experts and parliamentarians over the inclusion of its former chairman John Laker on the inquiry panel.


Want a job in the future? Prepare yourself for Snapchat applications, computer game-style cognitive assessments, and video applications before you even get the chance to talk to a human.
Employers are increasingly using technology to find more efficient ways to select and screen out candidates but workplace advocates have warned short video applications could open the door to discrimination and unfair hiring practices.
Major companies that have experimented with using technological advances in the hiring process have said that so far it has proven worthwhile.
McDonalds has a filter in the popular app Snapchat, which allows applicants to superimpose the corporate behemoth's uniform on themselves, and then record a 10-second video applying for the job.

McDonalds WA market manager Bradley McMullen said the firm still went through the normal interview process, but the Snapchat videos were a way for candidates to show a bit of their personality.
"We get the odd application that doesn't work for us, but the overwhelming majority have actually been excellent applications and they proceed to an interview which they may or may not get through, but it's just the first step in our application process," he said.
Meanwhile automated, "volume-based" online application processes are being adopted by major firms such as NAB, which it said saved it 700 hours per month in reading traditional resumes and conducting job interviews.
Global accounting firm KPMG have just started using a "robot recruiter" — a completely automated system — for initial screenings where applicants complete tests structured as anything from computer shooter-style games to balloons that pop up with math questions on screen.

The games test cognitive ability, speed, reaction time, and decision-making skills.
"Really it's drilling down into the next level of 'let's not just check if economics or accounting students are able to do the math, it's more about do they have the aptitude and skills to be able to perform the task," KPMG head of talent and acquisition Phil Rutherford said.
"The expectation is they are going to be comfortable applying through those means."
Mr Rutherford said staff viewing the videos were trained to remove unconscious bias, while hearing or speech-impaired candidates were able to access different application processes.
KPMG also offer "personality tests" candidates can take online to see what roles they may be best suited to.
Recruitment agent and trainer Suzanne Bailey said the way employers searched for talent was changing, and job hunters needed to know what they were up against.

She said automated and video recruitment saved employers money and time.
"We get to see you, we get to see the sincerity in your face, we get to see whether or not you're a happy smiling person, we get to see how well you're going to present our brand in our uniform," she said.
"We're going to see that you can actually communicate."
But she acknowledged it meant the process could be open to discrimination by employers.
"I believe there is a lot of discrimination that could happen because 'your brand' doesn't suit the brand of what we're looking for," Ms Bailey said.
"It could be your age, you could have just put on too much makeup, your hair could be really scruffy, and we don't need that."

Unions WA secretary Meredith Hammat said young people should be aware of the potential pitfalls.
"Of course young people are always really keen to win their first job, I'm sure many of them engage in the employer's recruitment processes without really questioning what it means," she said.
"I think the risk is employers will make discriminatory judgments with this kind of recruitment process.
"When all they're doing is having a quick look at someone, making some discriminatory judgements about whether they have the right look to fit in, without properly considering the sort of skills that person might bring to the job."
Shelby, 17, got her latest job by submitting a short video application.
She said it was helpful to be able to have a few goes at recording her interview, to prepare for the real thing.
"I do find it a bit easier, I'm quite shy in that respect, so it is kind of good to put yourself out there how you want to be seen at first," she said.
"I think it's just different and it's just something people may not be used to.
"If you're not technologically advanced it could be very complicated … if you're not familiar with computer software."


Australia has the capacity to store up to 1,000 times more renewable energy than it could ever conceivably need, according to an analysis by researchers at the Australian National University (ANU).

ANU engineering professor Andrew Blakers has conducted a study looking into pumped hydro sites and has concluded that there are at least 22,000 suitable locations nationwide.
Professor Blakers said if storage was built at just a tiny fraction of those places, Australia could transition to 100 per cent renewable power within two decades.
"No matter where you are in Australia, you will find a good pumped hydro site not very far away from where you, or your wind or your solar farm is located," he said.
"We only need to build about one or two dozen to support a 100 per cent-renewable electricity grid."
Pumped hydro works by pumping water uphill between two connected reservoirs when power is plentiful, and dispatching power to the grid when demand is high or when wind and solar do not work.
ANU engineering research fellow Matthew Stocks said a typical pumped hydro facility could deliver maximum power for between five hours and one full day.
The power could be quickly dispatched to the grid, when needed.
"It can go from zero to full power in about one minute," Dr Stocks said.


The technology behind pumped hydro is not new — a facility was opened in the 1970s at the Tumut 3 Power Station at Talbingo in New South Wales.
Pumped hydro is also widespread in Europe, especially in the alpine parts of Italy, Germany and France, and in Scandinavian countries like Norway. It is also widely used in Japan and the United States.
Professor Blakers said as investment in renewable sources of energy like wind and solar increases in Australia, the need for pumped hydro storage would grow.
"We have so little solar and wind in the system at the moment that we don't need the storage," he said.
"Maybe now South Australia, at 50 per cent wind and solar PV, is just getting to the stage where it does need either strong interconnection or a pumped hydro or both.
"But the other states will catch up and will be at the 50 per cent level by the early 2020s I think, so they also need to start planning with pumped hydro now."
For the report, Professor Blakers, Dr Stocks and their colleagues looked closely at tens of thousands of sites Australia-wide.
They found the greatest density of pumped hydro storage sites was in New South Wales, where they estimated there was potential to build 29,000 gigawatt hours' worth of storage capacity across 8,600 sites.
In Victoria they estimated there were 4,400 potentially suitable sites capable of storing 11,000 gigawatt hours' capacity, while Tasmania could theoretically support 2,050 sites, adding 6,000 gigawatt hours' of storage.

"The Great Dividing Range is the best place," Professor Blakers said.
"All the way from North Queensland down to near Melbourne has thousands and thousands of sites."
Professor Blakers said if pumped hydro storage facilities were built at just a handful of sites spread out nationwide, Australia could run on renewables alone.
"Pumped hydro, high-voltage DC interconnectors between the states, solar photovoltaics, wind, batteries and demand management can do the whole job," he said.
"Not just the whole job for electricity, but the whole job for energy — electrify land transport, electrify heating and cooling and you could make 75 per cent cuts in Australia's greenhouse gas emissions.
"And I think this is going to happen over the next 15 or 20 years."
The ANU researchers' work was funded by a $500,000 grant made by the Federal Government's Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA).

ARENA is itself already funding feasibility studies into pumped hydro storage in Tasmania, and in the Upper Spencer Gulf in South Australia and Kidston in north Queensland.
ARENA's CEO Ivor Frischknecht said while additional research was now needed into the 22,000 sites identified by the study, the message was clear — Australia could have 100 per cent renewable power.
"There's no question that wind and solar investment are going to keep going," he said.
"The challenge is to ensure that we end up with a reliable system that is also affordable, and that's where this study comes in.
"This study shows that it would be relatively affordable to run the entire system on wind, solar and pumped hydro."
In a statement to AM, Environment and Energy Minister Josh Frydenberg welcomed the study's findings.
He said the Government was already delivering a "major expansion" of the Snowy Hydro scheme and cited the on-going feasibility studies in Tasmania, South Australia and Queensland.
The Minister also indicated that the Government was working on a "new priority funding round for large scale storage and other flexible capacity projects including pumped hydro".


The Federal Government is being urged to ban a highly speculative investment scheme that has been hijacked by international fraudsters to steal millions of dollars from Australians.

So-called "binary options trading" allows investors to speculate on whether a stock or commodity price will go up or down.
A form of fixed-odds betting, such trading sees investors cash in — or lose everything.
Many established traders consider the investments too risky but naive amateurs are being aggressively sold the products by scammers promising huge returns.

Fraudsters in countries with few financial regulations are using gambling industry tactics and cold calls to pressure Australians into sending them money, which they falsely claim to invest on their behalf.
Some Australians have lost more than $1 million to these scams, alleging the money was never invested or dividends were not returned and they were persuaded to continue sending funds despite huge losses.
Binary options trading is legal in Australia, but the scale of fraud overseas has prompted Israel and Belgium to introduce bans.
Canada is pursuing an nationwide ban and the UK and European regulators are considering similar measures.

These scams are relatively new to Australia and the consumer watchdog is warning $7.5 million has already been lost, with ACCC deputy Delia Rickard saying that's just "the tip of the iceberg".
"If you've lost a significant amount of money, the sad news is you're very unlikely to get it back," she said.
The predatory tactics are worrying the Australian Security and Investment Commission (ASIC), which has forced Google and Facebook to stop promoting smart-phone apps run by unregistered traders.
Legitimate traders registered with ASIC are also concerned, with one chief executive telling the ABC he would support a "a complete prohibition" of simple binary options trading.
"We support any steps ASIC decides to make in addressing this unsatisfactory situation," he said.

Patrick Venaille, 62, lost $600,000 to an overseas scammer and is urging others to steer clear of binary options.
"I've got no more house, I live in a two-bedroom unit, and I still owe money to my brother-in-law," he told the ABC.

"I think I lost credibility a little bit with my kids, because I always preached them to not put their money in the same basket, and here I am doing exactly what I told them not to do."
The electrical engineer was made redundant in 2013 and turned to binary options. He spoke almost daily with a broker over Skype, who encouraged his betting.
"Over one day, we made $200,000 so I thought 'wow, this is incredible. Sounds like the guy knows what he's doing'," Mr Venaille said.
"I put more money into it, and slowly he asked me for more money still, and we slowly build up the account whereby I think we deposited a total of nearly half a million dollars."
The trader kept pressuring him for money and when he tried to pull out, asking for his money back, he was denied.
Adelaide man Peter Green has not told his family and friends about being strong-armed into the investment scam, which left him with a $50,000 debt.

The 63-year-old was rung every day by a broker who eventually convinced him to bet against the gold price, which is something he thought would be safe.
"My family doesn't know, apart from my mother and some close friends, so it is rather embarrassing and yeah, it hurt," he said.
"It means staying living with my mother for a bit longer now, that's for sure. We're having a tough year business-wise, so it's been a pretty hard year actually."
Mr Green said his money was left sitting into an account in Dubai but was never invested by the broker, it was simply stolen.
"He robbed me all my savings I was trying to put aside to build a house, so it's been pretty hard," he said.


The Melbourne-to-Brisbane inland rail line will be built across the Condamine floodplain in Queensland, despite farmers' warnings that it could put lives at risk.
Federal Infrastructure Minister Darren Chester has written to residents informing them of his decision, which he is due to officially announce in Toowoomba later this morning.
An announcement had initially been expected earlier this year, but landholder concerns prompted a review of the four proposed routes.
Mr Chester said the relative cost and transit time were factors in making the decision, but he acknowledged "this decision will be disappointing for some" and "has not been taken lightly".

The chosen route — shown in the map above as the purple line — is similar to the alignment known as the "base case" proposed by the Australian Rail and Track Corporation (ARTC) in 2010, but deviates east after the Condamine floodplain to go via Pittsworth, Brookstead and the Wellcamp-Charlton Industrial Precinct
Toowoomba's Wagner family built and owns the international Wellcamp Airport and had promised to invest millions of dollars in creating a road-rail-air transport hub geared towards food and agricultural produce if the rail corridor was shifted closer.
"While cost is not the overriding factor in decision-making for the preferred alignment, the Wellcamp-Charlton option has the lowest incremental cost compared with Base Case," Mr Chester said.
"It also offers the shortest transit time."


But floodplain grain-growers Brett Kelly and Jason Mundt have told the ABC the decision could be "catastrophic" for farmers.
They said flooding in 2010 inundated their farms, devastated crops, and dislodged a section of the existing railway.
As a result the line between Millmerran and Brookstead remains closed, the farmers added.
"It makes no sense to build the line across an extensive floodplain when there are better options upstream where there is less water," Mr Kelly said.
Mr Kelly and Mr Mundt said they had been told by ARTC the inland rail would be built on an embankment two metres higher than the existing line.
"If you consider building another line two metres higher, you're virtually building a dam wall, but without the same reinforcement," Mr Kelly said.
"It could definitely put lives at risk."

Mr Mundt said the higher embankment could see water back up for tens of kilometres in a big flood.
"You'll have people swimming out of their bedrooms, really," he said.
"If you thought Grantham was bad, you ain't seen nothing until something like that," he added, referring to the deadly 2011 flash flood in the Lockyer Valley town that killed 12 people.
Landholders at Millmerran, whose farms are now likely to be dissected, are also furious, saying the chosen rail corridor will cut through prime agricultural land.
"The final design will be subject to an extensive planning and approvals process, which will work through questions about technical and environmental aspects," Mr Chester said.
"I have asked the ARTC to work directly with affected landholders to refine the design of the railway."


Tabcorp's $11 billion bid for rival gambling outfit Tatts has hit an unforeseen courtroom hurdle put in place by the takeovers handicapper, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission.

Tabcorp had expected to be well into the home straight with the takeover before the start of Spring Carnival, but now finds itself back it the starting gate, chaffing at the bit, as the ACCC recorded a surprise victory in the Federal Court.
Tabcorp planned to sidestep the ACCC — which had publicly questioned the benefits of the merger — by seeking and winning approval from the Australian Competition Tribunal.
That move riled the ACCC's competitive instincts and it hauled Tabcorp into court seeking to have the ACT approval set aside.
The Federal Court backed Tabcorp's argument to a degree and called for more submissions to be made by all parties before another hearing on Thursday September 28.
James Packer's relatively new entrant in the field, CrownBet, had also jumped aboard the ACCC appeal, arguing the deal was bad for punters and the public interest.
"The ACCC is pleased that the Full Federal Court has set aside the decision, however the reasons for the decision are not yet public," ACCC Chairman Rod Sims said.
The ACCC's appeal centred on what it argued was the faulty reasoning of the ACT such as the merger would not cause a substantial lessening of competition.
"The Tribunal [also] made an error when it failed to compare the likely future state of competition both with and without the proposed acquisition in order to assess competitive detriment," Mr Sims said.
"Finally, the ACCC argued that the Tribunal had made an error in failing to assign less weight to benefits which would be retained by Tabcorp, its shareholders and the racing industry, and not shared with consumers more broadly."
The initial decision from the ACT placed only one condition on the sale —  requiring Tabcorp to sell its pokies monitoring Odyssey business in Queensland.
If the merger is ultimately waived through, the new enterprise will control about 90 per cent of Australia's totaliser betting and will generate revenues in excess of $5 billion.
Tabcorp forecast the deal would release about $130 million a year in synergies by eliminating overlapping IT platforms, merging head offices and cutting jobs.


The ANZ has become the second big bank in a week to forecast the Reserve Bank will turn hawkish and raise rates twice next year.

The move follows the NAB change in call on the RBA last week of a two rate hikes next year, from an earlier call of no change.
The ANZ's change of view was driven by a more positive view on the domestic economy with both growth and inflation picking up, while it forecast the unemployment rate would fall to 5.3 per cent by the end of the year.
"In sum our outlook for 2018 is a touch more positive than before, reflecting a stronger outlook for non-mining business investment, the strength in public sector spending [not only in the infrastructure space] and a shallower dip in residential construction than previously expected," ANZ's head of Australian economics David Plank wrote in a note to clients.
The ANZ argues the real cash rate — the rate adjusted for inflation — was already negative and if economic growth accelerates and inflation picks up as expected, it will become even more negative and unnecessarily stimulatory.
"[The] RBA has progressively shifted to a hawkish outlook," Mr Plank said.
"Downside risks to growth and inflation have eased, suggesting less need for a negative cash rate."
It is a similar view over at the NAB where GDP expectations have been revised up, unemployment revised down and consequently inflation moves up as well.
NAB's head of global research Peter Jolly noted the most confident thing he could say about the bank's change in forecast was it would not be the last.
"The big deal here is that having been on a declining trend since 2011, for the first time, NAB is now saying we have seen a turning point for Australia's interest rate cycle," Mr Jolly said
The other big banks are staying put with their forecasts, with CBA pencilling one rise in the fourth quarter next year while Westpac says the RBA is hold right through 2018.
Westpac chief economist Bill Evans says he does not share the optimism of either the other banks or the RBA about the economy.
"I think the RBA believes it will be raising rates next year," Mr Evans said.
"They are very optimistic on growth, they believe they will see strong income growth."
Mr Evans is convinced the RBA is wrong.
"Income growth is around 1.5 per cent, spending is around 2.5 per cent and that is at the expense of [household] savings.

"We are looking at a substantial drag from the construction sector which is a very job intensive activity."
Mr Evans said it looks like the labour market may be over-shooting and if softness continues in the services sector and retail, employment growth would roll over, causing a big problem for the RBA.
ANZ's David Plank concedes household consumption will remain relatively subdued, even if income growth picks up.
The bigger risk to his two-hike theory would be the on-going appreciation of the Australian dollar.
"A strong rally in the Australian dollar toward 90 cents, for instance, could be enough to defer a rate hike in 2018.
"Likewise, evidence that core inflation or wages are slowing again would rule out a rate hike in 2018."
The ANZ also rules a third hike next year due to the heavy indebtedness of Australian households, noting two rises would be enough to take the average mortgage repayment back to the previous peak of loan serviceability.
For its part, the market is already ahead of the ANZ and NAB's moves, with futures trading bringing forward its expectation dramatically in just the past couple of weeks.
Even last week, futures trading had only one hike priced in during the next 18 months, now it has two and the trajectory is getting steeper.



Steel baron Sanjeev Gupta and climate change expert Ross Garnaut sound like strange bedfellows.

But they're teaming up in an effort to disprove conventional wisdom that you can't run a steel mill with renewable energy.
In the process, they're also aiming to deliver much cheaper electricity, to improve the competitiveness of Australian steel-making and possibly bring down household power bills as well.
Mr Gupta is a British billionaire who made his name buying failed steel-making businesses and making them profitable.
Earlier this year the so called "Man of Steel" swooped in to save the former Arrium steel works in Whyalla, South Australia, from foreclosure and its thousands of workers from dole queues.

He's now one of the biggest energy users in Australia, with steel mills in Sydney, Melbourne and Newcastle.
In an effort to bring down his power costs, Mr Gupta has bought a 50.1 per cent stake in Zen Energy, the company set up by former Rudd Government climate advisor, Professor Ross Garnaut.
Together, they're planning to set up an array of renewable energy, that will include solar, pumped hydro and "a bit" of battery to feed the company's energy hungry steel-mills and provide any excess power into the grid.
They claim it'll not only deliver clean power that's reliable, but also at a much lower cost.
"We're very confident we can deliver on that'" Professor Garnaut told 7.30.
"We're happy for the sceptics to watch what we do, and they'll learn what's possible."
Since their plan will also reduce demand on the grid, they claim it will also drive down the cost of power for everyone.
"It's going to bring down cost of energy, dispatchable baseload cost of energy, in Australia dramatically," Mr Gupta said.
Not everyone agrees it can be done. On Tuesday former prime minister Tony Abbott told 2GB such a plan simply wasn't viable.
"You can't run a steel plant on renewables, you can't run an aluminium smelter on renewables and if we want to keep all of these heavy industries we have got to have reliable baseload power, and the only way you can do that is with coal, or with a gas." Mr Abbott said.

"A battery will not run a steel mill, a battery will not run an aluminium smelter."
The steel billionaire agrees with one part of Mr Abbott's statement.
"When everybody says you can't run a plant on battery, of course it's right, it's not meant to," Mr Gupta told 7.30.
"All it's meant to do is stabilise the grid."
As well as renewables, the plan will include some coal and gas.
"While every electron that's used won't be from renewable energy, we expect to be putting more renewable energy into the grid than we're taking other energy out of it," Professor Garnaut said.
The new business partners are now calling on the Government to agree on a market mechanism, like a Clean Energy Target, to provide industry with certainty beyond 2020.

"The rational way forward is to put in place stable incentives that allow Australia to meet its international commitments," Professor Garnaut said.
"Let business get on with the job of finding the lowest cost ways of meeting our power needs within that framework."
Mr Gupta agrees.
"You have a country which is blessed with all the natural resources to allow you to be perhaps the lowest cost energy producer in the world," he said.
"And yet you are the highest cost producer of energy in the world.
"So to put it bluntly, it's broken and it has to be fixed."


There is no evidence the release of stormwater from Abbot Point Coal Terminal caused widespread contamination of the nearby Caley Valley Wetlands, Queensland's Environment Department has said.
Adani's coal terminal was granted a temporary licence to help it manage water on the site during Tropical Cyclone Debbie in March.
The company was fined by the department after advising it had released water with sediment levels eight times higher than was permitted.
Satellite imagery appeared to show contamination to the wetlands, located near Mackay, prompting the Environment Department to commission an investigation.
It found a coal concentration of 10 per cent in sediment where water was discharged from the facility, reducing to "minor" concentrations of 1 to 2 per cent further away from that point.
The report found no evidence of widespread contamination and little visual evidence of fine coal particles across the wetlands.

"The appearance of water bodies in remotely sensed imagery can be affected by several factors, including the depth and clarity of the water, the angle of the sun and the sensor when the image is captured," the department said in a statement.
The department said it would conduct additional monitoring and had issued a notice to the Abbot Point terminal to prepare an environmental evaluation.
Queensland Conservation Council's Tim Seelig said it was far too early to say there was no evidence of contamination given the substances in question.
"We do know that sediment in sections of the wetlands contains 10 per cent coal pollutant," he said.
"That is vastly more than we would expect to occur naturally …  Adani should be held responsible and fined."



House prices in Australia's two biggest capital cities are between 25-30 per cent overvalued, according to a leading economist, but he only expects a 10 per cent fall.

To come to that conclusion, Paul Dales from Capital Economics has done the numbers on what houses should be worth.
Many analysts look at house price to income ratios to determine whether real estate is overvalued.
On a simple version of that measure, Mr Dales said Australian house prices would need to fall by an average of 38 per cent to get back to fair value — worse than the 30 per cent US property price plunge during the global financial crisis.
However, he noted that this measure does not take into account the long-term lower level of interest rates and therefore the bigger amount people can comfortably borrow and the lower rental returns investors demand.
When you calculate a "normal" house price to earnings (HPE) ratio factoring in these changes, you get 4.6 as the result.
But it is not all good news.
The current HPE ratio nationally is 5.8, which means property prices would need to fall an average 20 per cent to get back to long-run norms.
The news is far worse in Sydney and Melbourne, where the HPE ratios are about 7 and 6.5 respectively — that means a fall of almost 30 per cent is required in Sydney, and more than 25 per cent in Melbourne, to return to historical fair value levels.
Not that this is what Mr Dales is expecting.
"Our view is that prices in Sydney and Melbourne will broadly stagnate or fall modestly over the next two years and that prices won't fall significantly until the RBA starts to raise interest rates, which might not happen until late in 2019," he wrote in his note.
"Thereafter, prices in both capital cities may fall by around 10 per cent."
Why markets that are between 25-30 per cent overvalued will only fall 10 per cent is not explained in this note, but Mr Dales promises more analysis soon.

"What actually happens to prices in those cities will also come down to future changes in lending standards, changes in demand at home and from overseas, and the extent to which lending standards have been compromised over the past decade," he observed.
"These are topics that we will tackle in more detail in the near future."
When it comes to lending standards, a recent survey by investment bank UBS provided evidence that things have not improved over the past few years, despite a bank regulator crackdown on risky lending practices.
The UBS study found that up to a third of new mortgages were based on false or inaccurate information — that equates to around $500 billion in home lending.
The good news for those outside Sydney and Melbourne is that the worst problems appear to be confined to Australia's two biggest cities.

"Our analysis suggests that while housing is overvalued in almost every city, it's not quite as overvalued as some analysts have suggested and the risks are concentrated in Sydney and Melbourne," Mr Dales observed.
Mr Dales said house prices might need to drop 5-10 per cent in Hobart and Brisbane, and around 5 per cent in Canberra and Adelaide, to get back to more normal levels.
However, Perth's pain over recent years has seen its house prices fall back to fair value, according to Mr Dales, while Darwin is now almost 5 per cent undervalued.


The Australian and Indonesian trade ministers have announced they have set a November deadline to complete a bilateral trade deal.
Trade Minister Steve Ciobo is in Jakarta for one of the final rounds of talks with his Indonesian counterpart, Enggartiaso Lukita.
Mr Ciobo said once the deal was done, Indonesia and Australia would both be in a stronger position in what he described as a "win-win" partnership.
A previous deal, announced during the Indonesian President's visit to Australia in February — for Australia to dump tariffs on pesticides and herbicides — took force from Wednesday in exchange for Indonesia reducing tariffs on imported raw sugar in about a fortnight.
The bilateral trade deal is known as the Indonesia-Australia Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (IA-CEPA).

Mr Ciobo said he would not provide a sector-by-sector analysis of negotiations, and limited details have been made public.
"Clearly though, negotiation by virtue of the definition of the word means that there is compromise on both sides," Mr Ciobo said during a joint press conference in Jakarta.
The Trade Minister used the example of tariffs on Australian skim milk powder as an example of how a reduction in protectionism could assist both nations.
"The consequence would be that skim milk powder would potentially be cheaper here in Indonesia," the Minister said.
"And the reason that is important is because Indonesia uses skim milk powder to make sweetened condensed milk which Indonesia then exports."


Discharged mental health patients from the Royal Hobart Hospital who have been sent to stay at backpacker hostels have assaulted guests and verbally abused staff, according to a hostel manager.
The Tasmanian Health Service (THS) has confirmed it regularly pays for discharged patients who are homeless to stay at hotels and other accommodation facilities.
The Government has denied claims from Labor that staff are being pressured to discharge unwell patients.
Jessica Johnson, manager of The Nook backpacker hostel in Hobart, said she received regular bookings from the hospital for discharged patients who had nowhere else to go.
"A lot of the time we have had people that have been clearly very unstable," she said.
Ms Johnson said last year a discharged mental health patient staying at the hostel assaulted another guest.
"He bashed another guest, and didn't even know what he'd done," she said.

She said another discharged patient smashed the front window of the Nook's sister hostel, the Pickled Frog, with an A-frame sign when he was asked to leave after harassing other guests.
"It's really threatening behaviour. We are not at all qualified to deal with that, and it is quite unfair to be expected to have that put on us," Ms Johnson said.
She said discharged patients had also checked themselves in and were later monitored by mental health staff.
"They say 'the hospital sent me', or some other mental health place," Ms Johnson said.
Ms Johnson said the hostel was no longer accepting bookings from the hospital.
"We have had verbal problems where they [discharged patients] had gone around and abused guests, and also problems where they have been physical and violent, and also just really threatening behaviour," she said.

Labor Opposition Leader Rebecca White questioned Health Minister Michael Ferguson about the practice in Parliament.
"[Hospital] staff are coming to us because they are concerned about the pressure that is being placed on them to free up beds," she said.
"They are worried they are being placed in a position where they are potentially discharging patients who they feel need to remain in hospital."
Ms White pointed to a case in which a patient with a history of self-harm had been discharged and sent to a hotel outside of Hobart.
Mr Ferguson accused Ms White of misleading Parliament and said the THS did not discharge acutely unwell patients.
"The rule of THS and the hospital of course, is that you don't discharge patients until it is safe to do so," he said.
He said the patient Ms White had spoken of in Parliament was homeless, was happy to go to the hotel, and was receiving care.
Mr Ferguson said THS staff should be celebrated for helping people who are homeless.
"Staff have been ridiculed first of all for making a clinical judgment that a person is safe for discharge from hospital, that should be supported not ridiculed."
The Mental Health Council said there were gaps in the provision of services for people with mental illness.
Chief executive Connie Digolis said there had been ongoing concerns about housing for people leaving hospital, but was hopeful new mental health services would help alleviate the situation.
"It's really about being able to provide those supports and often being transitional supports, or short-term supports for people then to be able to get back on their feet," she said.


From lead roles in Hollywood to the stages of Paris, Greta Scacchi's acting career has taken her around the world.
But the 57-year-old is particularly fond of the cinema of Italy, where she was born.
"I think that, as in many countries in the world, Italy is in a period of change," Scacchi told RN Drive.
"There's been a struggle with economic pressures and with the pressures of informal immigration.
"Because of the shifting identity of Italy, and the difficulties that people are suffering there, the cinema is beginning to produce a kind of new neo-realism that's as gritty and real and good as some of their post-war cinema."
Scacchi, who is an ambassador for the Italian Film Festival, which is touring capital cities, believes that there is an open reverence for art, academia and culture in Italy, which leads to a very different sort of film than those produced by major Western studios.
"When you watch Italian films it's very engaging, because you must engage with them," she said.
"You are requested, as an audience, not to just lie back and have the thing wash over you — you have to think and apply yourself and then you'll find it's very rewarding.
"It [Italian cinema] doesn't necessarily answer all the questions; the stories can have some inconclusive quality, but that is their truth — not all questions can be answered and things aren't black and white."
Though she is best known for her work in Hollywood films like Presumed Innocent and The Player, for Scacchi those projects were a means to an end — a chance to return to the roles she truly loved in Europe.
"I didn't go to Hollywood until I really had to," Scacchi said.
"European film directors wanted me for a project, but the producers and the money people decided they had to go for a bigger American name.
"When that happened to me the third time, I went to the [United] States."
After two weeks in Los Angeles, Scacchi said she was offered a role in Presumed Innocent.
"So that was the ticket that I needed to get into their kind of American market," she said.
"I soon ran away … I didn't like it very much."
Scacchi's long and varied career has seen her take roles in everything from Australian favourites like Looking for Alibrandi, to period dramas like Emma, alongside the likes of Gwyneth Paltrow.
Having worked on films around the world, she believes that each country has its own distinct culture on set, and America's is the most hierarchical.
"The star system is their form of monarchy," she said.
"I remember when I first walked onto a film set in America and nobody was allowed to look Harrison Ford in the eye."
Yet, when starting out in England, Scacchi was told of the importance of knowing everyone on set.
"In America there was no chance to do that because if you ever met eyes with the focus puller, he would look down at the ground," she said.
When she began working in Italy, Scacchi found that it was necessary to become more distant for her own protection.
"In Italy, when I applied this technique of getting to know the names of the focus puller or the clapper loader, by day three they were saying 'come here and give me a kiss' or 'why don't you sit on my lap', and I realised that in Italy if you are a lead actor, you don't say hello to everybody," she said.
"They don't want you to be familiar — they want you to be just a little more on a pedestal."
And again Scacchi explained her experience of working in Australia was different yet again.
"In Australia, of course that wouldn't go down at all well," she said.
"Everybody here is the same, it's democracy, it's egalitarian, and I actually like that environment most of all."


If you follow the financial news, you'd have heard or read a lot recently about a surging or stubbornly high Australian dollar.
After touching lows below 70 US cents during the commodity crash of 2015, the Aussie has been on a steady course higher against the US dollar, or greenback.
The first phase of that recovery was intimately linked with the bounce back in iron ore and coal prices that has lifted Australia's export prices and finally boosted national incomes — incomes that had been falling since the last, and biggest, commodity boom topped out in 2012.

However, this close correlation appears to have broken down, at least over the past couple of weeks.
The Australian dollar has risen more than 8 per cent since the start of June, hitting 80 US cents in late July and holding that level.
While gains earlier this year correlated closely with rising commodity prices, the past week or two have seen most commodities drop, including a 10 per cent fall in iron ore spot prices.
There are a few reasons why the Australian dollar hasn't responded to this retreat and instead held close to two-and-a-half-year highs.
Paul Dales from Capital Economics said one key reason has been some positive local data.
"The domestic economy has been a bit stronger than people expected," he told the ABC, with the most recent example being another better-than-expected rise in full-time jobs last month.
However, good news on the Australian economy is only half the story of the AUD-USD exchange rate.
"Events in the United States have been surprisingly weak, especially in terms of its inflation figures, so the Australian dollar has received support from a weakening US dollar."
AxiTrader's chief market strategist Greg McKenna said the greenback's weakness is the main reason why the Aussie dollar is caught in the "tractor beam" of 80 US cents.
"My view is that the US dollar is the underappreciated side of the AUD-USD cross," he wrote in a note.
"If you look at all the factors affecting the Aussie dollar this year, it's clear that it is the US dollar's fall which has the major directional influence."
That's obvious if you look at the AUD-USD pair versus the cross-rates — that is how the Aussie is doing against other currencies.

As the graph shows, while the Aussie has been climbing recently against the greenback, it's generally been losing a bit of ground against the euro, British pound and even the Canadian dollar, which is a "commodity currency" similar to Australia's, although much more linked to oil prices.
The reason the US dollar has been falling against most currencies is that traders had been betting on more aggressive rate hikes by the Federal Reserve as they expected President Donald Trump's promised tax cuts and infrastructure spending to boost the economy.

Those policies have stalled, as has the Fed's rate rise timetable.
Recent speeches from key Fed officials had prompted markets to reduce the odds of another US rate hike this year to around 30 per cent, although some very recent economic data has seen that tick back up to 47 per cent.
Lower US interest rates than traders had been expecting meant the US dollar was looking overvalued and that is why it has been sold off.
Greg McKenna said that trend could continue if the outcome of the Fed meeting, which Australians will hear about on Thursday morning, implies lower rates for longer.
"If we see a dovish outcome, as the last batch of Fed speakers we heard from before the pre-meeting blackout period, then the US dollar could be crushed and the Aussie will be back near, perhaps above, 81 cents and its multi-year highs," he noted.
But he expects that the Fed will continue on its path to bring interest rates back up to more typical levels, as well as starting to exit the "quantitative easing" stimulus it has provided since the global financial crisis by selling some of the assets it holds back into the market — so-called tapering.

"While I see the taper as having equivalence to a tightening in rates due to its eventual impact on bond rates, I still believe the US economy justifies higher rates this December and again in 2018," Mr McKenna argued.
Paul Dales no longer thinks rates will rise this year, but expects a series of catch up increases in 2018.
"I do think they will raise them rapidly next year, so it wouldn't completely surprise me if the Australian dollar did fall back to maybe 75 cents by the end of this year and perhaps even to 70 cents next year," he said.


British billionaire Sanjeev Gupta, who purchased the Whyalla steelworks earlier this year, has now bought a majority stake in Adelaide-based energy company Zen Energy.
Zen's work is focused on renewable energy and storage technologies.
The joint venture between Mr Gupta's GFG Alliance and Zen will be known as SIMEC Zen Energy.
In a statement, GFG Alliance described the move as "an opportunity to invest in large-scale power projects to meet its own industrial requirements and support the domestic economy".
Mr Gupta, who is executive chairman of GFG, described the high cost of energy for Australian consumers as "a crying shame for a country so rich in resources".
"Given the issues here, it has been a priority for us to take decisive remedial steps. Combining our power expertise developed in the UK and Zen's local knowledge in Australia, is a natural partnership," he said.
Zen chairman Ross Garnaut described the move as a "perfect match".
"Their understanding of the energy dilemma this country faces, which is making much of our industry uncommercial and environmentally unsustainable, means we see the market need and opportunity in the same way," he said.
Last month, Mr Gupta toured the Whyalla steelworks, promising to invest well over $1 billion in the business in the short to medium term with "far grander plans" in sight.
At the time, he said the company had an immediate plan to invest in the steelworks' existing co-generation plant to bolster its energy capacity.
GFG Alliance has 500 megawatts of operating power in the UK and another 500 megawatts under construction.


The rollout of the new $10 note began on Wednesday, featuring a number of improved security features designed to protect the note against counterfeiting.
However, the rollout of the new $5 notes last year experienced a number of issues, with many notes unable to be read by many vending machines, or automated note readers at supermarkets.
Will there be similar issues this time? Here's how the rollout is expected to unfold.

The $10 note incorporates the same security measures as the $5 note, including a top-to-bottom clear window, complex holograms and areas only visible under UV light.
Both notes also included new tactile measures to help aid those who are visually impaired, with two bumps added on the long edges of the note next to the top to bottom window.
It's been almost 25 years since the Reserve Bank (RBA) released a new series of bank note.
"The technology available to counterfeiters, like the technology generally in the community, is improving all the time. So we need to stay several steps ahead of the counterfeiters," RBA assistant governor Lindsay Boulton told the World Today.
This time around, the RBA said it had given businesses operating vending machines enough notice about new notes so they could upgrade equipment if necessary.
"The Reserve Bank works closely with bank note equipment operators and operators of vending machines to make sure they're ready to accept the notes and we have provided assistance to them over the course of the program of releasing our bank notes," Mr Boulton told News Breakfast.
"We have made production-quality bank notes available to equipment manufacturers and operators over the past six months so they can prepare their machines to be ready to accept the new notes."
National Vending Association president Nick Aronis said "we're hoping it's going to be a smoother transaction".
"Most of the major issues that we encountered with the new $5 note have been resolved," he told ABC Radio Brisbane.
"Most of the vending industry has upgraded all the hardware that was not compatible. So we believe this time around it's going to be a smoother transition by simply just upgrading the firmware on all the note readers."

New firmware has been installed on more than 100,000 vending machines in Australia, at a cost of roughly $4 million, but it is impossible to guarantee it will work until the new notes are used.
"We're really not going to know how they will perform until the $10 note is in circulation and it gets used and tested thoroughly," Mr Aronis, who is also the managing director of vending machine supplier Ventrader, said.
That's because all types of note readers — regardless of what equipment they are installed in — are based on reading sensors, which pick up on the various elements of different types of bank notes.
So any variances from that note — including the clear strip, the fluorescent ink, the raised printing and the size of the note — can have an impact on whether the note readers accept or reject it.
"The RBA do communicate [with us] and provide us with sample notes [but] the issue that you have, which is what happened with the $5 note, is if you take a number of notes from various batches that are manufactured, you will see variances, and according to the RBA these are acceptable tolerances when the note is manufactured," Mr Aronis said.
"Now those tolerances mean that the clear strip may vary in width or positioning as well as some of the other elements on the note itself and we've also experienced the overall size of the note may vary as well.
"Now, all those variances have an impact on whether the note can be read successfully or not."

Yes. The existing series is still legal tender.
"The public can continue to use them in exactly the same way they have in past," Mr Bolton said.
"Over the next weeks and months, as the new $10 note makes its way out into the community, the old series will circulate through as they normally do, through the Reserve Bank's processing centres."
As the notes make their way back, the RBA will take the opportunity to withdraw and replace them with the new $10 note.
After the release of the $5 and $10 notes, the RBA is now planning to rollout a new $50 note in roughly the next 12 months.
"That is our highest-circulating note, so therefore we think it's important that we release that one sooner rather than later, again to stay ahead of the counterfeits," Mr Boulton said.


Gold Coast Mayor Tom Tate has spoken to the ABC for the first time since journalists were kicked out of his press conference yesterday.
Councillor Tate said that event was to discuss a Four Corners story that probed links between councillors and developers on the Gold Coast.
Cr Tate said he planned to sue the ABC over that story, which was why the ABC's journalists were banned from the press conference, while other media were not.
"It is a specific issue and I wouldn't talk to the ABC about that issue, it wasn't about other matters," he said.
"As I have said my doors are always open and happy to discuss any matters with the ABC except the litigation."
Cr Tate was at an opening for a high-rise building at Surfers Paradise this morning when he spoke to the media.
A group of workers with the CFMEU union chanted slogans against the Mayor.
But Cr Tate said he was not upset.
"A lot of the workers said 'Good on you Tom'," he said.
"I think you [the ABC] must have selective hearing."
Cr Tate also spoke about a cruise ship terminal he proposed to build off the Southport Spit.
A large section of the feasibility study on the terminal was kept from the public until it was published by Four Corners this week.
The 56-page redacted section warned council that ships could be pushed onshore by heavy winds or waves and the project was unlikely to recoup the cost of construction within 30 years of operation.
But Cr Tate defended the nearly half-a-billion-dollar project, insisting the design was safe and it would be good for the regional economy.
"I don't know what book you have been reading," he told the ABC.
"The business case stacks up."
The project is still in a development stage.


Former prime minister Tony Abbott has intensified the pressure on Malcolm Turnbull over a clean energy target.
It is understood Mr Abbott could cross the floor to vote against Government legislation to reduce greenhouse emissions by creating incentives for renewables or cleaner energy sources.
But there are several steps required before there would be a vote in Parliament to test whether the former leader would carry out that threat.
Chief Scientist Alan Finkel recommended the clean energy target in his report to the Government in June.
Mr Turnbull adopted all of the recommendations in that report except the clean energy target.
He recently said he was aiming to make a decision on the target by the end of this year.
It is understood that the Government is considering a different title for the target and it would likely to take a different form than Dr Finkel recommended so that it could include so-called "clean-coal".
But with Mr Abbott leading the push against any further measures to reduce emissions, Mr Turnbull has yet not spelled out details or a specific timetable.

It is not clear when the Coalition party room would be asked to debate and decide a clean energy target.
"It would be unconscionable — I underline that word unconscionable, for a Government that was originally elected promising to abolish the carbon tax and to end Labor's climate obsessions to go further down this renewable path," Mr Abbott told Sky News.
He indicated his views had support within the Coalition party room.

"I think the important thing is the party room, if necessary, saves the Government from itself," he said.
Malcolm Turnbull was repeatedly asked about Mr Abbott's position but deflected to criticism of Labor, and downplayed internal divisions.
"I'm not going to run a commentary on other people's remarks," he said.
"Everyone in the Coalition, of which Mr Abbott is a member, are united in ensuring that Australians have affordable and reliable energy."
Nationals MP George Christensen has also said he would vote against a clean energy target in any form.
His Nationals colleague Ken O'Dowd told the ABC's World Today program he was also prepared to cross the floor if he was not satisfied with the Government's proposal.
Deputy Prime Minister and National Party leader Barnaby Joyce would not answer when asked what his party's position is on the clean energy target.
"We stand for making sure we keep manufacturing workers in a job, making sure we keep power workers in a job, making sure that we keep Mr and Mrs Smith at 123 Jones Street with a power bill that they can afford that's where I stand," he said.
Mr Joyce said the Government would meet its obligations under the Paris agreement on reducing greenhouse emissions, but again did not say what mechanism it would adopt.
Mr Joyce defended Mr Abbott's commentary against the Government's policy, "because he is a backbencher".
"That is one of the graces you have on the backbench that you have the capacity to express your views the way you see fit," Mr Joyce said.


Ever felt the urge to build a battery?
Now it is possible after the Queensland University of Technology (QUT) created Australia's first lithium-ion battery at a purpose-built facility on Brisbane's northside.
It took three years and $4 million to develop the facility, which can produce batteries similar to those used to power Tesla cars.

Peter Talbot from QUT's Institute for Future Environments said the endeavour would hopefully kick-start an Australian battery manufacturing industry.
"At the moment we can take someone to our facility and within an hour or two show them how to produce a lithium battery, and they can take it away in a device to run a little torch or something — it's not that hard," Professor Talbot said.
"We get in raw material from Australian suppliers and we develop the chemicals that go into the batteries and we actually roll and make the batteries and test them ourselves.
"This process could be automated to enable Australia to have a competitive advantage in a manufacturing space that is currently dominated by China."
Lithium ion batteries are one of the most popular type of rechargeable batteries, and are used in portable electronics from mobile phones, to power tools and drones.
The raw material — lithium — was already mined in Australia, and Professor Talbot said the facility could value-add to the mining industry.
"As the middle class in the ASEAN (Association of South-East Asian Nations) region grows, so too will the demand for lithium-ion battery operated goods," he said.
"As more and more vehicles in the future are manufactured to run on battery power, the development of longer lasting batteries will be crucial to a vehicle's overall efficiency and appeal to consumers."

He said there had been enormous interest in QUT's project.
"This is a good example of value from universities where we can interact with industry and help educate them and work with them to develop ongoing important industries in Australia," Professor Talbot said.
"This research wouldn't have been possible without the financial backing of the Australian and Malaysian governments and highlights the importance of international research partnerships in the efforts to solve global problems."



Iron ore is heading for its fourth consecutive week of falling prices as fears of faltering demand and tougher seasonal pollution controls start to bite.

Having peaked near $US80 a tonne last month, prices have tumbled more than 10 per cent since.
There appears to be little hope of any immediate change in sentiment with forward looking indicators all looking weak.
The principal issue is the expectation steel demand will fall as authorities move to tighten credit to rein in debt and speculative excesses.
Broad-based economic data in August revealed industrial production, fixed asset investment — a proxy for infrastructure and property construction — and retail sales all pointed to a slowing economy, following on from a equally subdued reading in July.
As well, August credit figures pointed to China's central bank slowing the injection of money into the economy over the past two quarters, tightening overall liquidity in the economy.
That tightness has flowed through to a rapidly cooling property market.
Last month new house prices in tier one cities grew at an annualised pace of less than 5 per cent, compared to a peak of more than 30 per cent early last year.
Significantly, prices in Shenzhen are now 2 per cent down over the year, while Shanghai is up just 3 per cent.
The credit-fuelled construction boom has been a significant driver in the demand for steel and its raw materials — iron ore and coking coal.
Westpac's Elliot Clarke said the actions by authorities are clearly continuing to have a significant effect on the property market.

"The August 70-city property price data was telling, being the first time that annual growth in tier one new home prices has fallen below that of tiers two and three," Mr Clarke said.
"The reaction of developers to continued price gains remains muted. The pace of growth in sales and starts continues to trend down."
Mr Clarke said fixed asset investment was likely to continue to slow through next year.
"The residential construction sector in China is maturing and under strict regulation. Future growth cycles will be muted relative to history."
The more immediate impact on iron ore prices is likely to come from the seasonal crackdown on air pollution caused by streel production.
The state-controlled Xiahua news agency has reported that key steel making areas — such as Hebei province, outside Beijing, and the port city of Tianjin — have been ordered to cut steel production by up to 50 per cent by mid-November.
Xiahua said authorities were anxious to pull back on coal-based air pollution that rises by 30 per cent as winter approaches and central heating is switched on.
Much of the pull back in production has been due to the shut down of illegal electric induction furnaces.
However, this is not necessarily bad news for big iron ore exporters such as BHP, Rio Tinto and Fortescue as the older furnaces tend to use lower grade ores and scrap steel as their feedstock.
Nonetheless, this week's significant step down in prices has taken its toll on the big miners, with their share prices down around 5 to 8 per cent in recent days.
Westpac forecasts that iron ore will be sitting at around current levels at the end of the year, but will be well below $US60 a tonne this time next year.


Aquaculture is widely recognised as the world's fastest growing food sector, worth around US$200 billion by some estimates.
As the world's population grows by an estimated 1.6 billion people over the coming three decades, so will the demand for protein.
In Western countries it is seen as an ethical alternative, but the established aquaculture process has a fatal flaw — it's aiding in the depletion of ocean stocks, because many farmed fish have long been fed on fishmeal made from their wild counterparts.
It's a practice Jason Drew, the chief executive of a South African business called AgriProtein, describes as "sheer madness".
"The fish-in to fish-out ratio is negative," he says.
Alternative forms of fish food have been developed in the past and some, like the CSIRO-engineered Novaq, are being used by Australian prawn farmers to not only sustain the animals, but also increase their growth weight.
But a major problem with many alternatives remains the cost.
Watching the livestock graze at AgriProtein's Cape Town facility doesn't exactly fill one with splendoured visions of bucolic serenity.
The polite name for what they raise is larvae. The vernacular is maggot.

Dubbed the world's first industrial-scale insect recycling site, the new facility takes more than 250 tonnes of organic waste a day and uses it to produce around 50 tonnes of MagMeal — a food source for fish made from dried maggots.
The process is driven by more than 8.5 billion black soldier flies.
Mr Drew said it took eight years of experimentation and "abject failure" before they hit on the perfect breeding process.
"You can go out to almost any university bookshop and find theses on how to kill flies," he says.
"But very few people have actually wanted to make them survive and thrive, apart from ourselves."
Some of AgriProtein's funding has come through the Australian Government's aid and development programme, and the company plans to open seven more maggot factories in the next year — three in Saudi Arabia alone.
MagMeal might be food for animals, but the farmed fish it supports soon end up in kitchens around the world, helping to meet the exponential demand for protein that's resulted from the growth in prosperity of the new middle class in Asia and Africa.
One of the problems associated with industrial-scale fish-farming is how to control disease.
By some estimates, around 5 per cent of the world's farmed fish stocks are lost each year to pathogens.
Outbreaks are currently dealt with either by the use of antibiotics or vaccination.

Antibiotic overuse is problematic, because it can lead to an increase in viral resistance which, in turn, poses a danger to human health.
But the method is favoured by aquaculture operators because of the difficulties involved in hand-vaccinating fish.
Biotechnology developer Simon Porphy estimates around $US10 billion is lost to disease every year.
"Ten billion dollars worth of fish stock is equal to feeding 90 million people," he says. "That's the size of the population of Vietnam."
Mr Porphy's Irish-based company MicroSynbiotiX has been working on a form of oral vaccination, using natural materials and designed to be environmentally friendly.
"We realised that microalgae are a natural part of the fish diet and they're typically used in the hatcheries. What we are doing is basically genetically modifying the microalgae to encapsulate the vaccine," he said.
"Vaccines get destroyed in the stomach of fish since they are quite acidic, so we wanted to come up with an oral delivery mechanism that can overcome this particular challenge.
"The digestion process of the fish will unlock the vaccine and the vaccine will get absorbed in the hindgut of the fish, thereby eliciting a desirable immune response."
In many parts of the developing world families have traditionally raised fish in basic ponds to supplement their diet.
Aquaponics can provide a modern alternative, but building small household systems can be expensive and difficult to maintain.

Last year, Michigan-based inventor Michelle Leach was recognised for her work in developing a more resilient, low-cost aquaponic system by the Australian Government's Blue Economy Challenge, which seeks to reengineer aquaculture practice.
Ms Leach's inflatable aquaponic food production system was piloted in rural El Salvador with the assistance of non-profit organisations, and is just about to be trialled in Tanzania in East Africa.
Aquaponics involves the growing of vegetable and fish in a single recirculating biofilter-based system.
"Essentially the fish produce waste, and there's beneficial bacteria living in the system that break that waste down into a form of nitrogen, which plants can absolve," Ms Leach said.

"The fish are essentially fertilising the plants and the plants are cleaning the water for the fish. It's a way to grow a lot of food in a very small area using little water."
The current version, dubbed "The Oasis", costs around $US200 and resembles a small blow-up swimming pool.
"If you are in the tropical world you can grow 12 months out of the year, so that's two crops of 100 tilapia per year, and probably around 600 pounds of tomatoes," Ms Leach said.
"A person should be very easily able to pay back their loan within the first two years."

For many impoverished families, $US200 can prove to be a lot of money, so Ms Leach hopes micro-finance institutions will help make the technology available to as many people as possible.
While the system has been deliberately scaled down, she said it doesn't always have to be that way.
"We've focused on making it suitable to really improve the diet of a family of four to six members, with just enough to sell so that they have money to purchase the crop inputs, more fish and seeds for the next crop cycle," she said.
"That doesn't mean once a person understands how to do aquaponics, they couldn't have two systems and start increasing their income."


US President Donald Trump's escalating war of words with North Korea has failed to spook global stock markets.

"Rocket man [Kim Jong Un] is on a suicide mission for himself and his regime," President Trump said in his first address to the United Nations General Assembly on Tuesday.

He also said "we will have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea" if the rogue nation does not back down from its recent nuclear threats.
The President's earlier threat to reign in Pyongyang with "fire and fury" previously triggered a stock market sell-off in early August.
The latest warning had no effect on Wall Street or European markets — nor was there a flood of investors buying safe haven assets like gold and the Japanese yen, as investors shrugged off his comments.
What investors care more about is the Federal Reserve's upcoming signals on when US interest rates will rise, and how it plans to unwind $US4.5 trillion worth of stimulus it injected into the American economy after the global financial crisis.

The Fed began its two-day monetary policy meeting overnight.
The overwhelming market consensus is that tomorrow the US central bank will decide that interest rates will remain on hold.
Wall Street finished slightly higher on Tuesday, with stocks trading in a narrow range ahead of the Fed's decision.
Most sectors finished in positive territory, with the S&P financial index provided the biggest boost to the US stock market, gaining 0.8 per cent.
The US also released several pieces of mixed economic data overnight.
American import prices had their biggest gain in seven months, jumping by 0.6 per cent in August, the latest figures from the Labor Department revealed. The main contributor do that uplift was a surge in petroleum costs.
But homebuilding in the US fell for the second straight month. Housing starts fell by 0.8 per cent last month (to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.18 million units), the Commerce Department said.
On the other hand, the number of building permits issued rose 5.7 per cent to a rate of 1.3 million units last month — also its highest level in seven months.
Australian shares are likely to follow Wall Street's solid lead, and open higher today.
It looks to be a quiet day in the sense that no major local economic figures will be released today.
However, once again, the Australian dollar has rebounded past the 80 US cent mark on the back of a weaker US dollar.
That is despite the price of Australia's key export, iron ore, also plummeting by 4.1 per cent.


Electricity company AGL is considering replacing its ageing Liddell coal-fired power station in the NSW Hunter region with pumped hydro and gas generation.

The ABC can reveal the options are likely to be part of the company's plan to replace the lost electricity generation when Liddell reaches its scheduled closure in 2022.
AGL is resisting demands from the Turnbull Government to keep the 45-year-old coal-fired plant open beyond 2022, saying it is no longer reliable or financially viable.
Under pressure from Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, AGL chief executive Andy Vesey last week agreed to put to his board a proposal to keep the coal-fired power station open for another five years or sell it to another operator prepared to keep it running.
AGL will reveal its proposal within 90 days.
A 2013 report commissioned by the NSW Government, obtained by the ABC, shows it would cost at least $980 million to keep Liddell open for an extra 10 years.
This is on top of the expense required for maintenance until 2022.
"By extending the operation of the power station a further 10 years, increased tube failures and more frequent breakdown of plant and equipment can be anticipated," the report said.
"Higher unplanned availability losses should be projected for the final 10 years even with the additional expenditure provided."

The ABC understands AGL is considering replacing the coal-fired generators with pumped hydro or gas to make good on Mr Vesey's pledge to "avoid a market shortfall once the Liddell coal-fired power station retires in 2022".
One option is to split the artificial Lake Liddell into two different levels or use nearby disused mines to allow for pumped hydro power generation.
A more conventional option will be to build open cycle gas turbines or so-called reciprocating gas engines to generate power at times of high need.
The Liddell power plant generates a maximum 2000MW, but it failed during February's heatwave and contributed to the blackouts.
The station, built in the early 1970s, comprises four 500MW units, which burn pulverised black coal.



Latrobe City Council has criticised the push for the Heritage Council of Victoria to consider Hazelwood Power Station's nomination for heritage protection.
The station was shut down in March 2017 after more than half a century of operation.
It is in the process of being decommissioned in preparation for the mine site's transformation into a lake.
But Moe resident Cheryl Wragg wants the ageing plant to form part of a Latrobe Valley industrial history trail.
Ms Wragg was also behind the request to protect the old Morwell Power Station and Briquette Factory that prevented its demolition.
She said both sites are a big part of Victoria's history.
"This is not about putting a fence and a big padlock on a gate around these facilities and watching them decay and fall down, this is about taking those facilities and rendering them safe and opening them up to the public," she said.
Ms Wragg said it would be a mistake to demolish the buildings.
"I am committed, as are any number of other people around the Latrobe Valley, to the development of an industrial heritage trail and you can only develop an industrial heritage trail if you conserve, retain and repurpose that industrial heritage," she said.
A spokesman for the Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning said the "nomination will be assessed by heritage experts and considered on its merits".
The push has drawn criticism from the Latrobe City Council due to the site being full of asbestos which the Council said would be costly to maintain.

Mayor Kellie O'Callaghan said ratepayers were concerned it could be them picking up the bill.

"I think our community has been really clear they don't want to see any heritage listing resulting in the property that just becomes a burden for the community that may be left to deteriorate," she said.
"We certainly don't want any abandoned, decaying industrial sites."
Cr O'Callaghan wants a guarantee that the burden for looking after any protected sites will not fall to the Council.
"We just want to make sure there's a really solid consultation process around the consideration," she said.
The site's owner, Engie, has hired its own heritage consultants to identify items of significance at the power station and mine.
The company's spokeswoman said it would consult with the community, historical societies and the Latrobe City Council to "determine the most appropriate and respectful way to acknowledge the contribution Hazelwood made to the Latrobe Valley community and the state".


Australia's biggest miner BHP has confirmed it is reconsidering its membership of the country's peak mining lobby, the Minerals Council.

BHP announced it would review its membership of all industry associations, and publish the findings, by the end of this year.
The review comes hot on the tail of a demand by activist shareholders that the miner sever ties with the council, which successfully advocated for the abolition of the carbon price and is currently lobbying the Federal Government to reject a clean energy target.
"We are aware that some civil society and other organisations believe that, where an industry body advocates for a position which does not align with our own, we should cease to be a member of that industry body," BHP said in a statement issued overnight.
The activist's resolution to be tabled at the company's AGM next month is also calling for BHP to terminate its membership of the World Coal Association which, along with the Minerals Council, is also calling for a rejection of a clean energy target.
The resolution was lodged on Friday, and it appears to have hit on some issues already being discussed in the BHP boardroom.

Last month, the miner's head of external affairs, Geoff Healey, threw the first punch in a speech at a Minerals Council event, saying the two weren't seeing eye to eye on some issues.
"We recognise that we need to do even more to publicise where we hold materially different positions to those expressed by industry associations, including the MCA. And we will."
Brynn O'Brien, the director of the Australian Centre for Corporate Responsibility, which wrote the resolution, welcomed BHP's review of its membership of organisations.
"Obviously BHP understands, as well as its investors, that membership of the [Minerals Council] comes with profound risks to shareholder value. We are pleased that BHP has acknowledged these risks," she said.
"The [Minerals Council] has demonstrated a pattern of vociferous and influential lobbying which has obstructed progress on policy in Australia towards achieving policy measures aimed at restoring stability to Australia's energy markets and taking evidence-based action on climate change.
"BHP's positions on several key policy issues are at odds with these lobbying activities."
BHP has said it will consider the resolutions at the AGM, however the board is not recommending them to shareholders.
The Minerals Council of Australia declined to comment.


How many people travel through Brisbane's airport each day and what does the future hold for one of the country's busiest airports?
Last year more than 5.6 million passengers passed through the Brisbane International Airport alone.
It was also named Australia's leading airport last year at the World Travel Awards, beating Sydney and Melbourne for the title which looked at service standards and ease of travel.

Passenger numbers in Brisbane are set to increase with new direct flights to Beijing announced this week as part of the State Government's Connecting With Asia initiative.
Brisbane Airport Corporation's Rachel Crowley said the airport was expanding — quickly.
"The major growth in the last year has been into Asia, and it's a huge win to be flying directly to Beijing for Queensland and nearby trading areas," she said.
"We've got that core base of services into China and that's where the aviation growth internationally is coming from."
The $120 million international terminal expansion is set to be finished by 2018, allowing additional Airbus A380s to park in the area.

"We're expanding one end of the terminal by adding aircraft parking bays," Ms Crowley told ABC Radio Brisbane's Steve Austin.
"As well as this, six boarding zones will be added as well as additional aerobridges."
Ms Crowley said the recent announcement by Qantas to base its new Dreamliner 787-900s in Brisbane will open up new markets for tourism also.
"If Qantas look at direct flights to Chicago, Brisbane will be the only location that can service Chicago direct — you couldn't do that from Sydney as it's too far," she said.
The airport's second runway is set to be completed by 2020 but machinery is not yet onsite.
"For the last few years it's been about the 12 million cubic metres of sand on the site and setting up the base," Ms Crowley said.
"It's a 3.3-kilometre runway with 12 kilometres of taxiways ... it's right on track and will double our capacity."

Often seen as a city within the city, Ms Crowley said the airport precinct would also continue to grow.
"We envisage in 20 years there will be 45,000 people working onsite and we have 500 hectares of development land which is not aviation-based."
Ms Crowley said a new solar project would help lower the power costs of both airports.
"We're putting together 22,000 solar panels on rooftops of various buildings around the airport and that will take up 18 per cent of our electricity consumption.
"It's the perfect place to put a lot of solar.
"[It's] the biggest single rooftop site in Australia."


Police say they have arrested 10 protesters who were blockading the road to the Abbot Point coal terminal near Bowen in central Queensland.
About 50 people, including members of anti-Adani group Front Line Action on Coal, held banners and voiced their concerns at plans to develop the Carmichael coal mine facility in the north of the Galilee Basin in central Queensland.

Police said they charged 10 people with trespassing on business land, and those arrested had been taken to the Bowen watch house.
Whitsundays Police inspector Steve O'Connell said it was unfortunate arrests had to be made, but he was happy with the overall peaceful nature of the protest.
Bowen resident of 50 years, Elvyn Smith, attended the protest because she had concerns about the environmental impact of the proposed mine.
"At this time with climate change and the knowledge we have on that, that it is not a good time to be opening a large coal mine," Ms Smith said.
"With the extreme weather events that have been happening, coal is the thing that is fuelling this.
"I am here for future generations to protect this great place that we have."
Local councillor Mike Brunker said the protesters did not represent the views of local residents who opposed the protest.
"Finally now we see a bit of light at the end of the tunnel, and now we come and see this sort of rubbish. People are sick of it," Cr Brunker said.

Whitsundays Mayor Andrew Wilcox said the council was taking extra measures to protect the Bowen water supply after activists hung a banner on the town's reservoir.
Cr Wilcox said the council was not taking any risks.

"We're taking extra precautions now. We are just making sure we're doing more patrols," Cr Wilcox said.
"At the end of the day it's already all secured, but we're just doing that and we're also putting some cameras around the place.
"And then if we do catch some of these people, we hope that they face the long arm of the law."




When 94-year-old billionaire Len Ainsworth started making poker machines, Australia was a very different place: Robert Menzies was prime minister, thousands lined the streets for the first visit of the young Queen Elizabeth II and Nat King Cole dominated the charts.
"I was busy making dental supplies — my father having been a dentist — and he made dental supplies and equipment as a hobby. He said I ruined his hobby by turning it into a business and actually, I did do that," Mr Ainsworth remembers.
It was the early 1950s; Len was a young man in his 20s.
"This fellow Joe Haywood — an Englishman, a very bright fellow — asked me if I'd ever thought of making a poker machine," he says.
"So I said 'what's that? I don't know about them'. So he said, 'it's got a handle, you put money in them, you spin the reels and you might even get winnings from it'."
It was the chance jackpot any poker machine player would dream of.
But Mr Ainsworth had no idea what was to come: two personal fortunes and a reputation as the icon of one of the most controversial legal industries in the world.
His rise is documented in the new ABC podcast series How Do You Sleep At Night?

Back then, the plan was simple — Len and Joe would make the machines, to get the money, to build the dentist chairs. That was the big dream.
They called their company Club Man. Poker machines weren't legal yet, but it wasn't long before an agent came knocking.
"The contract in the first place was for two machines a week, and within a week he was back saying 'could he have four a week?'" Ms Ainsworth remembers.
"Then another week went past and it was eight a week… and then it became 16 a week… and then it became 32. And each time Joe said, 'can do'."
By late 1954, Mr Ainsworth had made his first enemies.

"I had a phone call from Joe, who lived next door to the factory. And he said, 'our roof's been blown in with a gelignite bomb'," he says.
"I went out and there were fire engines in the street, ambulances in the street, police everywhere. And there was a little man from The Telegraph dodging around with a photographer on his heels and he said to me, 'who did this?' and I said, 'I've no idea'.
"He said, 'do you think you've got enemies?' I said 'you know, I'm beginning to wonder'.
"I suppose I was surprised. I'm a calm person.
"The police said to me 'buy a shotgun and put chicken wire on your windows. You're in the big league now, son'."
In 1956, the pokies became legal in the pubs and clubs of New South Wales and Ainsworth's dreams grew bigger. He had ditched the name Club Man and his new company, Aristocrat, was born.
"I went to America and my eyes nearly popped when I saw the machines in Reno," he says.
"I was transfixed. I said 'I've just seen something that will make me a million'."
Len's rise and rise continued and as it did, his family grew. He had five boys to his first wife and another two to his second wife.
In 1994, a prostate cancer scare changed everything. His doctor told him he could be dead within the year.
"I thought the best thing to do would be to divide my estate up — which included the whole of Aristocrat at that time — and give it to my wife, my ex-wife, and my seven children," he says.
"So I divided it nine ways and gave it away."
But then after giving it all away, he got better, and his family became very wealthy.

Two years after the cancer scare, Aristocrat was floated on the Australian stock market, the share price went up, and so did all his family's fortunes.
Rather than retiring, the pokies king decided to have another crack at business — he started a rival pokies company called Ainsworth, which he runs to this day.
"Manufacturing is in my bones, really. I have to make things. That's what I like doing. So I'm a relatively creative person," Mr Ainsworth says.
"I am not an artist, but I can tell whether something is right or whether it's wrong for our industry. So I've been very fortunate in that direction."
Every year, Australians put $13 billion through the pokies. We have around 200,000 machines — roughly one machine per 100 people.
The states make significant revenue from them, despite growing warnings from public health experts about the damage these games can do.
But Mr Ainsworth describes claims that pokies are designed to addict as "total rubbish" and "nonsense".

"I mean, if you like something you'll continue to do it," he says.
"It's like kissing girls. Tell me the man that stopped kissing girls because he didn't like it."
Mr Ainsworth says his job is to provide entertainment, "or, as the English would say, amusement with a price".
"We do that very successfully. We make all kinds of features to entertain people, and it's really up to them from there," he says.
"I'll feel responsible for what individuals do when General Motors feel responsible for the accidents that some nut at the wheel might have."
Mr Ainsworth says his job is to provide machines which keep his customers happy, and their job is to be responsible to their customers — the people who play machines.
"I think if you can't control yourself, whether it's gluttony or where it's playing machines or whatever, well it's time you took some lessons," he says.

An elderly woman has been robbed of more than half a million dollars after scammers pretended to be her settlement agent and convinced her son to transfer cash into a bogus account.
The 83-year-old woman was one of six people targeted by similar cyber attacks in the last two months.
She was trying to buy a property in the western suburbs when it is believed scammers intercepted emails between her son, who was acting on her behalf, and her settlement agent.
An email asked for $558,000 as the final payment for the property to be transferred into an account.
By the time the son realised it was fake, it was too late, with just $1,000 left in the account.
In late August two clients of another western suburbs settlement agency lost $25,658 after emails were intercepted, and three payments towards property purchases were sent to scam bank accounts.
On September 13, another western suburbs agent and property manager had her account hacked.
Three prospective tenants received emails saying their applications were successful, and transferred a total of $7,300 into the accounts.

Consumer Protection commissioner Dave Hillyard warned agents to be on alert.
"We need to get to the bottom of this sort of stuff, we've got to alert the community, and more importantly back to the industry, to say you're got to really ramp up your security settings on your emails," he said.
A similar scam almost netted $200,000 from a father and son buying property south of Perth earlier this year, but they noticed the email address was slightly different to their agency's.
Perth residents have also been targeted after fraudsters successfully changed contact details of properties of South Africans living overseas, and then attempted to sell the properties.
In 2010, a man had his Karrinyup home sold for $485,000 while he was living overseas.
An Auditor-General's investigation into the regulation of the state's real estate industry in 2015 found there was "sound" oversight in place, and the risk of direct financial loss remained low.
The head of WA's real estate institute also urged agents to be more careful, but stopped short of calling for greater regulation of the industry.
REIWA President Hayden Groves said the industry already had strict regulations in place.
"As property managers they undergo strict and daily banking reconciliations … so there already is very strong regulation for the real estate industry in holding other people's monies," he said.
"I think more regulation is probably impossible, because the sophisticated nature of these phishing scams and these fraudsters is such that more regulation and more compliance … I don't think makes a difference."


After a one-hour creditors' meeting, US media giant CBS has emerged as the victorious bidder for the struggling Ten Network.

This is the second defeat for Australian media moguls Lachlan Murdoch and Bruce Gordon in two days.
Their unsuccessful bid to take over Ten follows Monday's decision by the Supreme Court of NSW.
The court ruled it would not restrain Tuesday's second creditors' meeting, nor would it restrict CBS's voting rights.
The big question on everyone's mind is whether Mr Gordon and Mr Murdoch will appeal against the court's decision.
After the meeting, Mark Korda, the partner of Ten's administrators KordaMentha, told reporters the disappointed duo have not yet lodged an appeal.
That confirmed what the NSW Court of Appeal told the ABC this morning.
"If other parties want to challenge that decision, they have their legal rights to do so," Mr Korda said.

Two votes were put forward to the creditors on Tuesday.

The first was whether to adjourn the meeting to another date, which they decided not to do.
The second vote was on the substantive matter of whether creditors preferred CBS's bid, or the joint Gordon-Murdoch bid.
"The creditors have decided on the future of Ten," Mr Korda said.
"What they decided was to vote — more than 50 per cent in value [of votes] and more than 50 per cent in number [of individual voters] to accept the CBS deed of company arrangement."
In terms of the numbers of voters, he said it was an "overwhelming vote in favour of CBS".
During the meeting, a change was made to CBS's revised bid, submitted to Ten's administrators on Monday evening.
It is understood CBS's new bid will pay unsecured creditors just over $40 million — $8 million higher than its original bid.
It comes after media moguls Bruce Gordon and Lachlan Murdoch submitted their latest bid last Friday, upping their offer to unsecured creditors from $35 million to $55 million.
"[CBS] increased their offer to Fox — their proposal is to negotiate with Fox a new content agreement," Mr Korda said.
"Failing that, a payment of $12 million, that was increased from up to $3.4 million."
Mr Korda said the CBS bid offered "the best return to creditors" and had "the least execution risk".
"It's pretty much business as usual for employees and for the program," Mr Korda said.
He confirmed the CBS takeover would be finalised within four to five weeks in what he called a "short settlement".
In the meantime, CBS is still waiting for the Foreign Investments Review Board (FIRB) to approve its takeover of the Ten Network.
When asked about his thoughts about Ten's future, Mr Korda said: "The industry is excited about $27-billion big brother [CBS] looking after Channel Ten."
KordaMentha expects to release the final voting results on Wednesday or Thursday.


Financials stocks boosted Wall Street at the start of the US trading week, which should bode well for Australian shares.

US and European markets finished higher overnight, and will likely provide a strong lead for the local share market.
Although North Korea's latest missile test happened on Friday, investors appear to have become de-sensitised.
The evidence of this includes: the traditional safe haven asset, gold, falling by 1 per cent; the US dollar strengthening; and the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) trading 0.5 per cent lower at 10.12.
What will more likely spook investors is an interest rate hike.
This week's main event is the Federal Reserve's two-day meeting to discuss monetary policy, though it is unlikely the Fed will be announcing a rate hike on this occasion.
The Dow Jones index ploughed through the US trading day to close at its fifth consecutive fresh-record — up 0.3 per cent to 22,331.
A large part of that boost came from the financials sector, with Goldman Sachs, Bank of America and JPMorgan shares all gaining more than 1 per cent each.
The optimism for financial stocks which boosted the Dow comes ahead of tomorrow's Fed meeting.
Even with a rate hike appearing unlikely, investors will be paying close attention to the Fed's comments on how it plans to unwind the $US4.5 trillion worth of government securities and other debt instruments on its books.
The American central bank accumulated these assets since the global financial crisis (GFC) as part of its quantitative easing strategy — to effectively throw a lifeline to the US by injecting more cash into its economy.
Before the GFC, almost 10 years ago, the Fed's pile of debt was substantially smaller at less than $US1 trillion.
On the other hand, the technology sector came under pressure on Monday, and finished practically flat.
Although the tech-heavy Nasdaq hit a record in the middle of its trading day, it pared back its gains by the end, and finished just slightly higher, up by 0.1 per cent.
Microsoft and Alphabet (Google's parent company) stocks fell 0.2 and 0.6 per cent respectively.
This was after Amazon Web Services announced it would move to charging businesses in one-second increments for use of its popular EC2 cloud computing servers.
Amazon's share price fell 1.3 per cent at Monday's close of trade.
Amazon has been charging by the hour for the use of its servers for the past 11 years.  In comparison, Microsoft's Azure and Google charge by the minute for the use of their servers.
A classic strategy for Amazon over the years has been price cutting.
"Per-second" pricing seems to be a continuation of that strategy for the purpose of increasing its market share.
ASX futures are up slightly by 0.1 per cent — which points to a slightly higher open for local shares.
In economic news, the Bureau of Statistics will release national housing price figures for the second-quarter.  -polled economists are expecting housing prices to rise by 1.1 per cent.
Also, the Reserve Bank will release the minutes of its board meeting from earlier this month.
"The RBA has been playing up what it says are signs of housing market moderation in Sydney in particular," NAB's head of foreign exchange strategy Ray Attrill said.
"But this may be less evident in these quite historical price figures than the more recent CoreLogic data where auction clearance rates have been on a moderating trend since early this year."


Zaun Bhana saw the carnage of Western Australia's mining downturn firsthand.
As clients folded, cut back on spending or sold out, Mr Bhana's IT firm Leap Consulting was forced to adapt.
But in the past 12 months, business has taken off — as more companies seek advice on how to cope with digital disruption.
"Customers are wanting more than just someone to fix their printer or tell them what they should do with cloud," Mr Bhana said.

"We cannot keep up with the amount of customers that are asking us for those [advisory] kind of services."
Founded in 2004, Leap provides IT strategy and support services to small and medium-sized businesses.
In order to meet client demand, five new workers have been added to Leap's payroll in under a year — one-quarter of its entire staff.

That hiring spree was considerably easier for the Subiaco business than it would have been previously, due to the downturn in the resources sector.
"In the boom, we really were challenged with affording just basic engineers," Mr Bhana said.
"[The downturn has] created opportunities to hire people with skills and experience we never would have had access to before, and that's leading to more business for us."
Adam Soudure is one of those recruits who would have been out of the company's reach a few years ago.
A redundancy from an ASX-listed mining services company led him to take up the equivalent position — chief information officer — at Leap.
"With where the market was going, not only in WA but globally in the resources industry … certainly there's more growth in the consulting space at the moment, and for me personally that was the right thing to do," Mr Soudure said.
It is not only the IT sector where a stagnant job market has given way to active recruitment.
For 12 months, WA job advertisements have been on an upward trajectory, driven by higher commodity prices and renewed optimism in the resources sector — with the flow-on effects being felt across the economy.

Exploration geologists, drill and blast specialists and underground engineers are among the most sought-after professionals, along with digital specialists and health workers.
Chris Kent — who heads the WA office of recruitment firm Hays — believes the local job market has finally reached a state of equilibrium.

"There was a lot of 'leaning up', a lot of shedding jobs and managing head count and trying to do everything efficiently and doing more for less," Mr Kent said.
"We've got to that tipping point where essential services — whether it's private sector [or] government — is starting to be affected, and therefore there's some natural job growth."
While online job ads have been climbing steadily for months, Mr Kent said a more recent trend was the decline in the number of views recorded for each advertisement.
That decline may be a lead indicator of a tightening job market, because it suggests there are fewer people competing for each position.
"Wage pressure always comes from skills shortages," Mr Kent said.
"We're thinking that that will start to move the dial a little bit over the next 12 months."
Some industries like construction, continue to lag behind the resources sector.

Residential and commercial building remains slow, after years of strong demand for housing and new office space.
It is hoped projects mooted by the Government may help absorb those blue-collar workers in the years ahead.
"The big growth generators, the big projects like Metronet and things, we're really waiting with bated breath for those to kick off," Mr Kent said.
"The jobs will probably be in the private sector, but it's government-facilitated [growth]."
As WA waits for the sod to be turned on Government projects, it's getting harder to find workers in the state's Goldfields.
Underground drilling company Perseverance, headquartered in Boulder, last month recorded its strongest monthly revenue since it was founded 21 years ago, and managing director Andrew Smith said the current market had all the tell-tale signs of a new boom.

"Since January, we have been employing about two people every month just to try and keep up as the workload increases," Mr Smith said.
"We saw it 12 months ago, we started seeing more work come through and certainly the last six months it's been absolutely flat out."
Drillers and maintenance workers — especially fitters — are in short supply, so the company is investing heavily in training.
"We get either people with underground experience and we train them up in drilling, or we get people with other drilling experience and we train them up underground," Mr Smith said.
"We can't get the people with the skills we need."
This week, ABC Radio Perth, News and Online are investigating How We Work Western Australia with a series of reports on the jobs market and the future of employment. Tomorrow, we look at the impact of workforce casualisation on businesses and employees.


Cruise ships using the Gold Coast's proposed $450 million oceanside terminal could "be pushed to shore" by strong winds and waves, according to a section of an official report which has been withheld from the public.

This warning — and other critical findings — have been blacked out in the publicly released Gold Coast City Council report into the terminal, which cost ratepayers $865,000.
But Four Corners has obtained the unredacted feasibility study, which also questioned whether cruise ship companies and private investors would be prepared to use the Gold Coast terminal.
It reveals cruise ship operators, "raised a number of significant concerns with the proposed design" which includes a jetty that would jut hundreds of metres into the Pacific.
The operators pointed out the facility would be in the open ocean and ships would be exposed to ocean waves.
"The prevailing wind is from south and south east, if a ship encounters problems, it could be pushed (by combination of waves and wind) to shore," the unredacted report said.
"The risk would be the highest as the ship was preparing to dock, as the speed would be reduced and the ship would be beam on to the prevailing wind."

Gold Coast Mayor Tom Tate, who championed the cruise ship terminal project, declined to be interviewed.
But Four Corners approached the Mayor after an event on the Gold Coast and asked if any safety issues had been blacked out in the report.
"Engineering-wise, it's very safe," Councillor Tate said.
"The best thing is that it'll create further jobs for the next generation. If at the end of it, if it doesn't tick all the safety box or the environment box, I'll be the first to vote it down, OK?"
A plan submitted to the Federal Environment Department included provision for up to 150 cruise ships to visit the terminal every year.
The terminal would sit on about six hectares of public land on The Spit.

One of the Gold Coast's most prominent developers, Norm Rix, slammed the proposal as one of the Mayor's "ambitious plans".
"It butts onto the oceans itself, and if you're looking for a tourist attraction, well that would be the first cyclone that comes along and washes the cruise ship onto the middle of Main Beach," he said.
A number of Gold Coast councillors have also come out against the project.
"I actually don't think it's viable or reasonable or feasible to build a 700-metre jetty out into the open ocean," Councillor Glenn Tozer said.

"I think it's almost a ridiculous proposal," Councillor Peter Young said.
"It's a mighty big ocean and it has very powerful waves. There's very many days in any year when they just will not be able to get a ship into this city."
Councillor Young said it was unfair the public had not seen the unredacted report.
"I think the public should have the capacity to fully evaluate the information that's been provided. After all, the public paid for the report."
The unredacted report obtained by Four Corners also questioned whether the cruise ship terminal was viable.
"It is unlikely that cruise companies are prepared to sign up to long-term agreements to guarantee usage of the facility or that there would be sufficient desire for private investors to take patronage risk on this large-scale infrastructure," it warned.

The study also said massive infrastructure, such as fuel, water, waste water disposal and food provisioning would be needed onshore for the terminal to work as a base port for Australian cruise lines.
It pointed out ships may need more than, "1,000 tonnes of fuel per visit to be taken on board".
On the environmental front, the unredacted feasibility study warned there was a medium risk the terminal's breakwater would have an adverse impact on coastal processes or wave climate at the beach.
Champion surfer Mick Fanning this year labelled the cruise ship terminal plan an "eyesore", warning it would destroy one of the Gold Coast's most amazing beaches.


Aid groups are scrambling to control the spread of diseases among Rohingya refugees in Bangladeshi border camps, with a massive immunisation program underway to treat 150,000 children.

UNICEF Australia is just one of many non-government organisations that has sent a team to see firsthand the situation facing the 400,000 Rohingya Muslims who have fled to Bangladesh from violence in western Myanmar.
UNICEF Australia's Oliver White is in one of the those camps and says a massive immunisation program is underway to help prevent diseases spreading.
"It is unprecedented. What has struck us most is the huge number of children, women and the elderly," Mr White said.
"Those three groups make up 80 to 90 per cent of all those displaced in Bangladesh."

Mr White said disease was one area UNICEF, along with the Bangladesh Department of Health, was trying to get on top of.
A vaccination campaign against measles, rubella and polio is underway this week to immunise 150,000 Rohingya children below the age of 15.
"We are working with the Government of Bangladesh, the World Health Organisation and others to stop diseases spreading in such unsanitary conditions," Mr White said.
He said it was critical the international community stepped up its efforts to help the refugees.
"[Bangladesh is] doing its very best, it's working with UN agencies, but the needs are just so huge and that is why we are appealing to the Australian community and the Australian Government to give generously," Mr White said.

Mr White said many children had either been separated from their families or their parents had been killed in the violence in Myanmar.
"There is over 1,200 unaccompanied children literally standing by the side of the road. They are incredibly vulnerable. Young girls at risk of forced marriage and trafficking," he said.
Mr White said child-friendly spaces were being created.
"Most importantly they need a safe place to sleep, so we are setting up areas they can come to and be with other children to play."
Mr White called on the international community, including Australia to step up its efforts.
"Many of these children who have fled conflict and persecution and have arrived in Bangladesh seeking safety will die from malnutrition, sickness and disease."
The Australian Government has donated $5 million to help the Rohingya refugees, with $4 million going to Bangladesh and the remaining money to the Red Cross inside Myanmar.



The poor audio quality, the bad grammar, the mispronunciations — one of the latest scams doing the rounds in Australia is so bad it's almost laughable.
This past week, a Queensland woman found a voice message on her home answering machine, with a female robotic voice telling the resident she was from the Australian Tax Office (ATO).
"We have received an affidavit against your name where you are being listed as a primary suspect, and your house is under surveillance [pronounced sur-vur-lance]," the recording said.
There were a number of clues, including the "affidavit against your name", suggesting this one was a scam.
A quick internet search shows many saw right through it:
"Recorded mess from tax dept, house under surveillance, affidavit logged bla bla bla another scam" — Glen
Someone else said they called the number back.
"[He] gave his name as Hoffman and said he was from the Tax Fraud Dept. He wanted my name and the mobile number on which I received the call. When I refused to give personal details without knowing the reason for the call he told me to 'get lost' and hung up" — Lynne
ATO assistant tax commissioner Kath Anderson said there were some obvious signs when it came to identifying scams.
"The main thing is we don't threaten people. We don't send the police around, we don't threaten prosecution," she said.
"The ATO has a scamline — 1800 008 540. That's where you can call the ATO and talk to them about the call received.
"We'll let you know if it's genuine, and if it is we'll put you in contact with the right person in [the] ATO."
Ms Anderson said phone scams were the most common.
"The scams really take off from the start of July. We see them right through to the end of tax time at the end of October," she said.
"It's because a lot of people are interacting with the tax office in their once-a-year interaction, and the scammers know that."

Federal Labor is demanding an independent inquiry into whether Employment Minister Michaelia Cash breached ministerial standards and tried to keep allegations against the former head of the construction watchdog quiet from Cabinet.

Nigel Hadgkiss resigned as commissioner of the Australian Building and Construction Commission (ABCC) last week, after admitting he broke Fair Work Act laws between January 2014 and July 2016.
In the Federal Court, Mr Hadgkiss admitted he knew about material distributed by the precursor to the ABCC, the Fair Work Building and Construction Commission (FWBC), that suggested employers could make reasonable requests to stop union officials holding meetings in workplaces.
Under changes to the laws, the employer no longer had that right and unions could meet workers in meal rooms for talks if needed.
Mr Hadgkiss was the head of the FWBC at the time.
Last week, Senator Cash told Parliament she had been made aware of the allegations In October 2016 — but Mr Hadgkiss was appointed commissioner of the ABCC in December 2016.
Shadow employment minister Brendan O'Connor argued the resignation of Mr Hadgkiss should not mean the search for accountability ends.
"Of course the Government doesn't have a loyalty gene, of course they were going to immediately throw Mr Hadgkiss under the bus," Mr O'Connor told ABC RN.
"But this is about whether in fact the Minister should have reported this matter, disclosed this matter to Cabinet."
The allegations by the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (CFMEU), prompted Senator Cash to defend her handling of the matter.
She said it would be wrong for the Government to stand down a government official every time the CFMEU made an accusation against them — suggesting the union had a reputation for being litigious.
"The litigation that is referred to was public knowledge, so that's the first point," Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull told reporters.
"Secondly, it obviously had to take its course.
"Thirdly, Mr Hadgkiss became the ABCC commissioner by virtue of an act of Parliament, because he was already the commissioner of the Fair Work Building Commission, which then became transformed into the Australian Building and Construction Commission, and given obviously stronger powers and the ability to levy greater fines."
But Mr O'Connor argued that legislation would have had to be signed off by Cabinet, which was either not told about the allegations by Senator Cash or ignored them.
"If Cabinet made a decision about the transitional provisions without being provided information about the allegations against Mr Hadgkiss, yes, then I believe there is a ministerial breach here," Mr O'Connor said.
"We've asked the Prime Minister to examine this independently and come back with the answers."


Working helps us pay the bills, buy food, pay the mortgage and live as comfortably as we can.
But how we work though has changed significantly in the past 20 years.
While there are more jobs available, for the first time in many years full-time work has fallen while there has been a spike in part-time or casual jobs.

"Part-time jobs have been growing and we're now around two-fifths of jobs are part-time jobs, and three-fifths are full-time jobs," Patrick Fensham, urban planner with SGS Economics and Planning, said.
"There's uneven growth in terms of full-time jobs, there is more casualisation, people are not being able to access the more certain and full-time employment they're seeking, and we're seeing the manifestation of that in terms of stresses around household income."
According to data from SGS, there were 2.6 million jobs in greater Sydney in 2016 — 1.9 million were full-time and about 750,000 were part-time or casual.
In the past 10 years employment in Sydney has grown by 800,000 jobs, with most of that growth occurring in western Sydney.
The industries employing the most people are professional, scientific and technical services, followed by health care and social assistance.

According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, a growing number of people are juggling multiple jobs to meet the pressures of Sydney's living costs and housing unaffordability.
And for those that may need to work part-time for family reasons, Mr Fensham estimates that up to half of those people would like to work more.
"People would like to have more income to pay their bills and that's an increasing problem for our cities and our country, and there is effective underemployment and people are unable to get the work scope they'd like to," he said.
The hardest hit in our community in terms of job security are young people, according to Professor Phillip O'Neill, director of the Centre for Western Sydney at Western Sydney University.
"Since the global financial crisis there has been virtually no recovery in young persons' full-time employment whatsoever," he said.
"If you're a young kid in Sydney and you don't have any post-school qualifications, you're obliged to take a part-time or casual job or not work at all.
"The full-time labour market for an unskilled worker has disappeared in the Sydney labour market."
For 20-year-old Tyler, working in the construction industry is only temporary work until he can find something else.
"I work to live basically, and for my indulgences," he said.
"I love my job but it's not what I really want to do."

Michelle from Penrith told ABC Radio Sydney that casualisation of the workplace did not just affect younger generations, but also discriminated against older workers.
The 43-year-old has been looking for casual retail work as she and her husband are unemployed and receive support from Centrelink.
"Young people are getting all the casual and retail jobs because they are cheaper to pay," Michelle said.
"When I worked in retail in the past, the younger people got all the shifts and I only got work if they didn't turn up.
"It's very difficult. The work that is out there and hours that are out there is the same as what I'm getting from Centrelink, so there's no point getting a job for only 10 hours a week ... sometimes I think it's not worth it."
Professor O'Neill said that in an increasing culture of part-time and casual employment, workers were likely to be monitored more closely, be given fixed-term contracts and be more vulnerable to redundancy.
According to Professor O'Neill, the population in Western Sydney is predicted to grow up to 2.9 or three million by 2036.

He said the key for job security in Sydney was to focus on supporting that growing population with better infrastructure and employment hubs like the one established in Parramatta.
"At current job creation rates, we will barely supply two-thirds of those resident workers with jobs in western Sydney," he said.
"In 20 years' time, we're faced with a huge problem of moving probably close to half a million workers every day out of western Sydney and half a million to return in the afternoon unless we create giant jobs concentration in western Sydney to deal with that problem.
"In order to meet the demand in the growth of resident workers in western Sydney, the equation is this: Western Sydney needs the equivalent of one Barangaroo worth of jobs, that's 25,000 net additional jobs every 18 months."
ABC Radio Sydney is investigating Working Sydney in a week-long focus exploring how we work now and how we'll work in the future.


Lady Mary Fairfax has died peacefully at her family home in Sydney, aged 95.
In a statement, Lady Mary's family said she died on Sunday night following a recent significant deterioration in her health.
Members of the Fairfax family, one of Australia's great media dynasties, have gathered at Fairwater — Lady Mary's harbourfront estate in Double Bay.
Born Maire Wein in Warsaw, Poland, she was the third wife and widow of Sir Warwick Oswald Fairfax.
With Sir Warwick she had three children, Warwick Fairfax, known as young Warwick, Anna Cleary and Charles Fairfax.

She also had a son, Garth Symonds, from her first marriage to solicitor Cedric Symonds.
"This is a deeply distressing time for the family," the statement said.
"Funeral details will be announced in due course. We have no further comment at this time."
Lady Mary was made an Officer of Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 1976, a Member of the Order of Australia (AM) in 1988 and appointed a Companion of the Order of Australia (AC) in 2005.
She has been acknowledged for her philanthropy, including gifts to St Vincent's Foundation and Garvan Foundation, and her roles with the Australian Ballet and Australian Opera Foundation.

Veteran Sydney journalist David Leser paid tribute to Lady Fairfax.
"She was just an extraordinary character," he said.
"She'd had a love affair in the 1950s that scandalised Sydney society, she had this harrowing divorce trial and a celebrated remarriage to Sir Warwick Fairfax. And she found herself at the centre of an Australian media empire.
"And then of course 30 years later she was blamed for the ruin of that empire.
"She was a figure of great romance in Australian business media circles and for some she was also a figure of vengeance. Some people regarded her as the Lady Macbeth of the Australian media landscape."
"I could never work out whether she was just monstrously misunderstood or whether she was as deceptive as she was clever."
In 1987, "Young Warwick", then aged 26, controversially bought out his family's holdings in publicly-listed newspaper company John Fairfax and Sons by borrowing heavily. However, by December 1990 the privatised company had collapsed and a receiver was appointed.
"That takeover bid by 'Young Warwick' — probably partly at the behest of his mother — absolutely decimated the Fairfax company and it was the beginning of decades of mismanagement and Fairfax is still trying to struggle with that today," Leser said.
"Lady Mary Fairfax had a multitude within and she was a very, very complex character."
He described her as a "tireless worker for the arts and charities" and "a generous, fun-loving hostess and friend".
"I don't know whether she was a family maker or empire breaker but she was just this larger than life matriarchal figure."
Lady Mary was known for her philanthropy, most notably supporting the Australian opera scene as well as medical research.

Opera Australia artistic director Lyndon Terracini said young singers benefited greatly from Lady Mary's support.
"Mary Fairfax made a tremendous contribution to opera in Australia generally, not just to Opera Australia," he
"Her support for young singers was exemplary and really she was one of the first genuine benefactors in Australia to contribute in a substantial way and an ongoing way.
"She raised money from other people as well as donating herself to the development of young singers so that in those days they could go abroad and study."
St Vincent's Hospital spokesman David Faktor said Lady Mary leaves a notable legacy at the hospital with her donations to projects and research.
"She took a keen personal interest in all our endeavours including those of the Garvin Medical Research Institute," he said.
"She was particularly interested in hearing and she supported our ENT units at St Vincent's."


Australian media mogul Bruce Gordon has failed in his last-ditch attempt to torpedo Channel Ten's takeover by US media giant CBS.

He had taken action in the NSW Supreme Court against Ten's administrators KordaMentha, arguing that his joint-bid (with Lachlan Murdoch) to buy the network had not been properly considered and a competing bid from CBS treated more favourably.
Mr Gordon, who owns the regional WIN Network, was seeking orders for the second creditors' meeting to be restrained.
But the court this morning ruled the meeting can proceed as planned on Tuesday — and it's expected that creditors will vote on CBS's takeover bid.
"It will be a matter for creditors at that meeting to determine whether [it] should be adjourned by reason of ... any recent commercial developments, or for any other reason," Justice Ashley Black said in his judgment.
By "recent commercial developments", the judge was referring to a revised Gordon-Murdoch offer submitted last Friday, after the Senate voted to pass media law reforms.
Mr Gordon's lawyers had argued the KordaMentha's creditors' report was deficient, namely because it only presented information about the CBS takeover bid, and not the joint bid from himself and Mr Murdoch.
He also sought court orders for CBS to be prevented from voting on its own bid for Ten at Tuesday's creditors' meeting.
However, Justice Black was not satisfied there were any deficiencies in the report.
The judge also ruled that CBS would not be prevented from voting on its own bid for Ten at Tuesday's meeting, or that its vote be restricted to the small nominal amount of $1.00.
Ten's troubles began in early June, when Mr Gordon's and Mr Murdoch's private companies, Birketu and Illyria, decided not to continue being the guarantors for the network.

The struggling network was then placed in voluntary administration on June 14 on the basis that it was "insolvent or likely to become insolvent".
Bidders for the Ten Network were invited to submit their final binding proposals by August 24.
However, Mr Gordon and Mr Murdoch submitted theirs one day after that deadline.
In any event, the administrators preferred CBS's bid over the Gordon-Murdoch proposal, and subsequently entered into an exclusivity agreement with the US media giant.
Mr Gordon attempted to torpedo CBS's bid by seeking urgent court orders to delay the second creditors' meeting, originally scheduled for September 12.
He was successful in that regard as the court granted that order, thereby delaying it to Tuesday.
The defendants in that case were Ten's administrators, and CBS. Mr Murdoch's Twenty-First Century Fox intervened, but was not formally a party to the proceedings.
At last week's hearing, Mr Gordon's lawyer argued that the second creditors' report was "deficient".
In particular, his lawyers argued that "any administrator acting in the best interests of creditors would inquire whether a competing bid would remain open after the time for its expiry".
Justice Black rejected that argument in no uncertain terms.
Mr Gordon was on Monday ordered to pay the other parties' legal costs.


The nation's biggest superannuation fund has moved to ensure under-25s no longer have insurance premiums taken from their retirement accounts unless they ask for it to happen.
Australian Super is the first major super fund to make insurance an "opt-in" for younger workers rather than an automatic inclusion, potentially saving them thousands of dollars over the life of an account.
The decision follows an inquiry by the Insurance Superannuation Working Group earlier this year, which showed that an overload of unnecessary insurance within superannuation risks a "rapid erosion" of some retirement nest eggs.
Australian Super's group executive for membership, Rose Kerlin, said the decision to allow under-25s to "opt-in" came after concerns that default insurance premiums are sometimes working against the long term interests of young workers.
"Australian Super has made this decision in the best interest of our members," she said.
"People under 25 starting out in the workforce need to begin building a base for their retirement savings.
"Given that they are often on relatively low incomes, the fund does not want to see undue account erosion because of insurance that may actually be of very limited value to them."
Australian Super — which manages $120 billion of retirement funds — has crunched the numbers and estimates that the exclusion of insurance premiums before turning 25 would save members an average of $9,000.

Ms Kerlin says the insurance component is mainly of benefit for people with dependents and financial commitments, such as a mortgage, who might be exposed to death or permanent disability.
Automatic insurance would apply to members over the age of 25, who would still be able to opt out if they wish.
"We want to stress that members under 25 will still be able to choose to have insurance if they want it," Ms Kerlin said.
However, questions remain as to the usefulness of many insurance policies in superannuation funds, including for older workers.
An investigation by ABC TV's The Business earlier this year revealed that many casual workers are unable to claim on the policies they are paying for, while many policies do not cover everything that many people would expect them to.

Insurance industry veteran Jim Minto, who chairs the Insurance in Superannuation Working Group, welcomed the initiative by Australian Super to end default insurance payments for members aged under 25.
"The industry is united in bringing forward to address a series of issues including some people have too many insurance accounts," Mr Minto told the ABC.
"I think all these moves that help benefit members and consumers are to be welcomed."
The working group is scheduled to release its draft code of conduct for superannuation funds later this week.
Pressure for greater disclosure on insurance within superannuation comes as the Federal Government cracks down on the sector to ensure rogue employers pay the correct contributions and moves to shake up the governance of super fund trustees.

Syrian Nadeem Turkia always knew he was going to work in hospitality — he just never imagined it would be in a food truck in Darwin.
After topping his class in his hospitality degree, he was about to leave Jordan for a coveted scholarship in the United States when being Syrian became an obstacle.
"The head of my university told me, 'they didn't accept you because you are Syrian. There is nothing we can do.' That was the moment my dreams stopped," he said.
Mr Turkia was born in Jordan, his mother's country, and lived there for most of his life.
But when the Jordanian Government changed its policy on Syrian nationals having rights to work and residency as it became inundated with hundreds of thousands of refugees fleeing war, Mr Turkia became an illegal immigrant in his own country.
"It was like you were in a big jail," he said.
"You couldn't work, you couldn't do anything, because they would send you back to hell, to Syria."

In Jordan, citizenship is conferred through the paternal line, and children are not automatically eligible to be citizens just because their mother is a citizen.
Mr Turkia's mother Taghreed said watching her husband and three sons lose their rights to citizenship filled her with anger and sadness, and frustration at the patriarchal system.
"I thought, 'why am I not Jordanian … what am I? If a man married a woman from another country, in three years she would become Jordanian, but I had no rights," she said.
The family of seven arrived in Darwin almost a year ago after being accepted as part of Australia's Syrian refugee commitment intake.
Before war broke out, the Orthodox Christian family spent the holidays in their Syrian home, Wadi al Nasara, or Valley of the Christians, a village on the outskirts of the northern city of Homs.
Mr Turkia describes it as paradise; a picturesque mountain village where food was plentiful and five minority groups lived together in peace.
It is a vision of Syria that he is keen to share with Australians who, he said, associate his homeland with war and conflict.
And to do it he has adopted the age-old Middle Eastern tradition of giving away falafel to anyone who walks by the window of his Darwin-based food truck, Flavours of Damascus (formerly Damascus Kitchen).
The truck moves around different suburbs and markets in Darwin during the week.

"When they taste it they start asking us where the food came from, and then we start talking to them about our culture and all the good things about Syria that they don't know about," Mr Turkia said.
"In our food you will taste our culture, you will taste all the spices that have thousands of years of history."
His family planned to use their culinary skills to bridge the cultural divide even before they set foot in Australia.
"When we heard Australia would take us, we wanted to say thank you for accepting us as part of your country," Mr Turkia said.
"This is the way I can say thank you."



Going off-grid could be the way forward for communities on the fringes of WA's power network after a trial of solar units exceeded the expectations of those involved.
Fed up with frequent outages and voltage spikes, six farming households in Ravensthorpe, 500 kilometres south of Perth, chose to take a leap of faith and try living off the sun and lithium batteries.
"It has been just fantastic, it's far exceeded our expectations, and it's very good, clean power," Ravensthorpe resident Ros Giles said.
"Friends are often out [without power] for up to 24 hours and thinking, 'we might come visit because you've got power and we haven't'," she said.
WA's energy utility Western Power offered the systems for free in the search for alternatives to the massive cost of replacing ageing poles and wires.
The utility builds and maintains transmission lines in remote areas, but landowners wear the cost of the lines on their properties.

The Giles family spent tens of thousands of dollars connecting their farm in the 1980s.
When the region experienced major flooding in January, receiving 310 millimetres of rain in four days, the solar units kept the lights on while many grid-connected customers lost power for days.
"It's good, clean, reliable power and that's the big advantage," Bernie Giles said.
"Cleaner meaning frequency and voltage consistencies ... and that means less damage to things ... like electric fence units with voltage spikes and fluctuations.
"We haven't come across anything we can't do that we could before as far as welding and using large amounts of power or starting electric motors, not a problem."

The trial's success has wide-ranging implications for the future of power generation in the country, bringing with it huge savings for taxpayers.
Ravensthorpe is a microcosm for the nation's power problems, one of thousands of tiny communities at the edge of the electricity grid.

For example, WA's South West network spans more than 250,000 square kilometres — an area the size of the United Kingdom  — yet it only services one 50th of the population.
Getting power to those communities is costly, unreliable and unsustainable, prompting utilities to look for alternatives.

"There's the potential for 3,000 sites that have similar types of reliability on those edge of grid type communities that we could put that similar technology in," Western Power CEO Guy Chalkley said.
Everyone within the grid pays the same energy tariff, meaning people in Perth subsidise the cost of supplying power to the bush.
It is a problem Western Power believes the Ravensthorpe trial has solved, potentially allowing it to save hundreds of millions of dollars.
"You'd be talking about a saving of about $300 million in terms of current cost of investment and cost of ongoing maintenance of distribution line against the cost of the stand-alone power system," Mr Chalkley said.
But the utility has hit a roadblock.
Legislation written before the technology existed only allows Western Power to distribute energy through poles and wires and not generate it  — which is how regulators view capturing solar rays for battery storage.

This has meant the utility has had to extend the trial for a further three years to allow the households to keep their systems.
Consultants are warning the government against dragging its feet.
"I think the regulations need to catch up, the fact technology has moved on and that the opportunity to provide a better outcome for consumers is being facilitated by that technology," energy consultant David Martin said.
"If it makes sense to put in a stand-alone power system, put it in, but let's not waste time rebuilding networks we don't need."
Energy Minister Ben Wyatt said while he was supportive of Western Power's efforts, he needed to consider if it was appropriate for the utility to enter the power generation market.
The utility would require both legislative and regulatory changes to roll out the systems more broadly.
It seems the families of Ravensthorpe could be waiting a while longer before they officially cut their ties to the grid.


Like gluten, sugar and lactose, nitrates appear to be next on the list of foods some Australians have decided to cut out of their diets.
Butchers and supermarkets are increasingly selling nitrate-free bacon, which is often twice the price of bacon that's been cured using sodium nitrate.
Butcher Blair Parsons said customers started asking for nitrate-free bacon about four years ago, prompting him to experiment with alternative preservatives and curing agents.
After some trial and error, Mr Parsons started using a cure of salt, sugar, water and sodium ascorbate which, as a food additive, has the code E301.
His shop in Bunbury, in the south-west of Western Australia, sells about 40 to 50 kilograms of nitrate-free bacon a week and he said demand continued to grow.

Some people do not like the salty taste left on the meat by sodium nitrate, while others say they believe their bodies react badly when they eat bacon cured with nitrates.
But most cite heath concerns as their primary reason for avoiding sodium nitrate, and point to studies that suggest the body converts nitrates to produce potentially carcinogenic compounds when digested.

Accredited practising dietician Jacklyn Jackson said the idea that nitrate-cured bacon was bad came from the fact that increased intake of processed meats led to an increased risk of some cancers.

"What a lot of people don't realise is that vegetables are the major contributor to our dietary nitrate exposure and can account for approximately 40 to 80 per cent of nitrates we consume, while processed meats generally only account for less than 10 per cent," she said.
Ms Jackson said dieticians could not say for sure what happened to nitrates in the body because each person's reaction was dependant on the presence of other bacteria, the level of oxygen in the blood, as well as other nutrition factors like antioxidants, fat and alcohol.
"In the stomach, nitrate is converted to nitric oxide and a range of other nitrogen-containing compounds," she said.
"Nitric oxide is an extremely beneficial molecule for cardiovascular health and has a role in regulating blood pressure and the function and structure of the blood vessels.
"Nitrates might actually be good for you."
The bi-national government agency Food Standards Australia and New Zealand says "consumers should be reassured that exposures to nitrates and nitrites in foods are not considered to represent an appreciable health and safety risk".

Ms Jackson said people should not worry about eating bacon cured using sodium nitrate, as long as they watched how much, and how regularly, they ate processed meat.
"As a general rule, the Australian Dietary Guidelines recommend people limit their consumption of processed meats like bacon, ham and sausages, regardless of how they have been marketed to us, as they have been shown to increase our risk of colorectal cancer," she said.
"If you're limiting your intake of processed meat to once a week, you'll be alright."


Superannuation funds could be drained by as much as $100 billion as companies slash wages and force workers out of long-standing enterprise agreements to deliver better returns for shareholders, a union-commissioned report has found.

The study cites wages theft, wage freezes, reduced penalty rates and cancelled workplace deals as factors diluting the overall superannuation pool, which could ultimately mean smaller retirement nest eggs for some Australian workers.
Companies singled out include Qantas, where thousands of jobs were lost in a restructure, and aviation services provider Aerocare, which has been accused of recruiting workers on below award conditions.
Aerocare provides safety checks and ground handling services to airlines such as Qantas, Jetstar, Singapore Airlines and Virgin.
Last month, the Fair Work Commission rejected Aerocare's enterprise agreement as unfair and unsatisfactory for its workers.
Streets Ice Cream, Griffin Coal, Aurizon and Murdoch University have also been named for suppressing wages through the cancellation of enterprise agreements, according to the Centre for Future Work at the Australia Institute.
The study was commissioned by the Transport Workers Union (TWU), which has been locked in a long-running battle with Qantas and its outsourcing partner Aerocare over worker pay and conditions.
TWU national secretary Tony Sheldon said around 3 million people — or a quarter of the workforce — would see their retirement savings weakened through wage suppression because of lower superannuation payments compounded over time.
Mr Sheldon told the ABC's AM program superannuation funds and the Government's Future Fund needed to urgently review companies they invested in to determine whether they were engaged in suppressing wages.
"This is a race to the bottom on lower wages and conditions and is ultimately harming the retirement incomes of the very people they are supposed to support," Mr Sheldon said.
"If a company is boasting of a sharply lower wage bill, super fund directors need to see it as a red flag, not a green light."

A Qantas spokesperson defended the company's decision to temporarily freeze wages, adding that it had implemented initiatives to "help close the deficit in women's retirement balances".
"Wage freezes of 18 months at Qantas were needed to make our cost base more competitive compared with the rest of the industry and ultimately make 30,000 jobs more sustainable," the spokesperson said.
"Once we returned to profit, employees were offered a 5 per cent bonus in recognition of the wage freeze plus two more profit-related bonuses worth $5,000 including superannuation.
"Last year, Qantas added a further two weeks superannuation to its three month maternity leave provisions, paid directly into super by default."
A spokesperson for Aerocare denied it was recruiting workers on below award conditions.
"Aerocare operates under a valid Enterprise Agreement, that pays more than the industry wide award. This has been confirmed by the Fair Work Commission," the spokesperson said.
"Workers' superannuation entitlements are paid in full."
The report comes days after Qantas chief executive Alan Joyce received long-term incentive payments, taking his 2017 pay deal to $24.6 million for successfully restructuring the airline.
According to the report, wage suppression created a $37 billion black hole in Federal Government revenue through lost taxes on superannuation contributions and the outlook for higher-aged pension payouts.
It found that in cases where enterprise agreements were cancelled and workers were forced on to the minimum award, individual retirees could lose as much as $270,000.
The report also cited wage theft scandals at Dominos, 7-Eleven and Caltex, and said where workers were illegally underpaid, retirement savings could be slashed by more than $50,000.

It said where employers imposed a temporary wage freeze, retirement nest eggs could be reduced by $30,000 over an individuals' retirement period.
Mr Sheldon urged the Government to ensure superannuation funds acted in the best interests of their members by not investing in companies that suppressed wages.
"The Federal Government is standing by and allowing this to happen, even supporting companies which rip their workers off," Mr Sheldon said.
The report referenced research from Macquarie Bank that showed employee-friendly companies outperformed hostile employers by 6.6 per cent annually.
Concerns about wage suppression and wage theft came as Australian workers experienced the slowest wages growth in recent decades of less than 2 per cent.

A shortage of aviation fuel has caused dozens of flight cancellations at New Zealand's Auckland Airport, with airlines advised to carry enough fuel for return flights after a digger apparently damaged an oil pipeline while trying to extract kauri logs.

About 27 domestic and international flights have been cancelled so far this weekend, a statement on Auckland Airport's website said.
The statement said fuel companies were rationing the amount of oil they supplied airlines because a leaking Auckland supply pipeline was being repaired at Marsden Point.
All supplies of aviation fuel to Auckland Airport were cut after a digger trying to extract kauri tree logs cut the oil pipeline on Thursday, according to a report from New Zealand Herald.
It could take between 10 and 14 days to restore the fuel supply.
The company told Auckland Airport it was working on repairing a section of its damaged fuel pipeline which connects the refinery to Wiri Oil Services Limited in Auckland — which supplies airlines with aviation fuel at the airport.
"Airlines operating at Auckland Airport have had their usual fuel allocations reduced," Mobil Oil New Zealand Limited spokesman Andrew McNaught said.
"We appreciate this will be inconvenient and will require airlines to take alternative fuelling measures."
Mr McNaught said airlines would have to carry more fuel to enable return flights without refuelling and stop to fuel at other airports on the way to and from Auckland.
Auckland Airport is New Zealand's largest international airport and handles more than 18.5 million passengers a year.
Chief executive Adrian Littlewood said the airport was working with airlines to monitor the impact of the disruption, with a focus on assisting passengers.
"We will have additional staff in the terminals supporting passengers and addressing any questions or concerns they may have," he said.
"We strongly recommend that any passengers travelling over the coming days plan ahead and check with their airline for the latest information."
Marsden Point owner Refining NZ spokesman Greg McNeill told the New Zealand Herald the issue began on Thursday, when a leak was spotted in the pipeline that supplies aviation fuel from Marsden Point to Wiri, near the airport.
Mr McNeill said the pipeline was cut by external damage, but did not confirm if it was caused by a digger was trying to lift a kauri log.
Prime Minister Bill English told reporters he had instructed ministers to work closely with the companies and offer Government assistance.

Putting to one side all sorts of worrying messages about risk, Wall Street ploughed on to a record close on Friday and raised the prospects of a solid start to the week for the ASX as well.

The S&P500 hit 2500 points for the first time, the Dow also closed at a new high and the Nasdaq was no laggard either, reaching a record mid-session before a bit of post-prandial profit-taking.
Despite weakness in Europe, the key global index the MSCI — which tracks about 2,400 stocks in 47 countries — ended the week at a new high as well.
All this, despite protagonists on either sides of Korea's Demilitarised Zone sending some test missiles skywards, the hurricane season rolling on and a pretty disappointing effort by US consumers in August.
It was all just sound and fury, meaning nothing for the markets.
The Federal Reserve's meeting this week is entirely a different matter.

It will not be a shock if the Fed announces its plans to wind back the $US4.5 trillion worth of assets it has amassed on its balance sheet — up from the less than $US1 trillion before the global financial crisis got cracking a decade ago.
Anxious to avoid the "taper tantrum" of 2013, the Fed has widely telegraphed the move.
Hopefully the market should not be too jittery, but trying to second guess the mass psyche of traders, which is in turn multiplied by algorithmic bots, is a mugs game.
The betting is the Fed will announce it will start reducing its holdings — in effect tapering its reinvestment in Treasury notes and mortgage-backed securities (MBS) — next month.
This should allow the Fed to put tapering on autopilot without being distracted by the recent trend "choppy data" flowing through.
It should also give it time to assess the market's mood — among other things — before deciding whether to raise rates again in December.
A decision to hike again at this meeting, while announcing the start of tapering, is probably too much for markets to digest at one time.

The Fed's musing about tapering in 2013 didn't go well. It was all just fear. Nothing happened, then the Fed backed away and basically kicked the can down the road to this week.

Certainly, long-term interest rates will rise and one of the worries is the US economy's recovery will be stifled as credit becomes tighter.
A softer US dollar will likely weaken further. That's probably not great news for the Australian dollar which has pushed through 80 US cents.
The $US1.8 trillion MBS the Fed holds naturally amortise at 1 per cent a month, so they should roll off under a $US20 billion monthly cap the Fed has set.
The $US2.5 trillion in Treasury notes should also decline at somewhere around 10 per cent a year as well. So it is a drawn out process.
The problem is the Fed has a massive position in the market and, as Macquarie Bank recently pointed out, about $US400 trillion of other assets around the world are linked to the big four central banks' bloated balance sheets.
The unknown is to what extent markets have become addicted to the easy money. Withdrawal symptoms can be very, very ugly.
The Fed's balance sheet is unlikely to shrink back to pre-GFC levels, because just as its assets swelled, so did its liabilities.
The money printing, the hoovering up toxic debt from the sub-prime lending binge as well as long-tailed government debt means much bigger balance sheets are the new normal for central banks.
Just as an aside, the Fed as the biggest dealer on street has made somewhere well north of $250 billion from its MBS portfolio.
That has in turn been handed back as a nice little earner for the ultimate supplier in the trade — the cash-strapped US Federal Treasury.
Nothing has gone that smoothly in the central banking world since the GFC. There is little reason to believe the taper will be the exception to that rule.
Assuming the taper announcement is not too far off expectations and one of the missile tests is not a fail on a disastrous scale, it is shaping up to be a quiet week.
Data and the calendar here and overseas is all very ho-hum.
One interesting item maybe the OPEC meeting in Vienna on Wednesday assessing how the self-imposed 1.8 million a barrel a day cut in oil production is going.
Compliance had edged up above 100 per cent, while global inventories slipped.
At the same time, demand forecasts supplied by the International Energy Agency have been edged up.
With oil prices holding above $US50 a barrel, OPEC will probably be pretty pleased with things so far.


Budget airline Ryanair is cancelling 40 to 50 flights every day for the next six weeks in a bid to improve its punctuality, but many passengers have been left stranded after being given "no notice" about the cancellations.

The Irish-based airline said strikes in Europe, air traffic control issues and bad weather had caused its punctuality level to drop to "unacceptable" levels, and that it also had a backlog of staff leave to clear by the end of the year.
"Ryanair's on-time performance has declined from 90 per cent to under 80 per cent over the past two weeks, a figure that is unacceptable to Ryanair and its customers," the airline said in a statement.
The cancellations could affect up to 400,000 passengers, who will be offered alternative flights or refunds.
The airline cancelled 80 flights on Saturday and 82 on Sunday, leaving many passengers stranded when they were told via text message that their flights had been scrapped.
"We got no notice and have to stay an extra three days in Rome with no help or support from Ryanair," one Twitter user said.
"We're out 400 euro ($600) already and we still have to get to Monday before the next available flight. It's madness. I'll never fly Ryanair again."
Another Twitter user said they found out their flight was cancelled by checking the website on the morning of their flight.
"We're due to fly at 10:00am and still haven't received an email and it's on the website the flight is cancelled! Never fly with them again," the user wrote at 7:00am.
Ryanair published the weekend's cancellations online but has not publicly confirmed which other flights will be axed over the next six weeks, causing angst for many customers who have booked travel with the airline.
The airline told customers flights would operate as scheduled, unless passengers received a cancellation email.
"Release a list of flights with more than 24 hours' notice please, so people can actually arrange alternative ways to travel," one Twitter user said.
"Publishing the cancelled flights for the next two days… why not publish them all? Shambles of a company," said another.
Ryanair said it apologises "sincerely to the small number of customers affected by these cancellations" and would work to organise alternative flights and/or full refunds.
"Cancellation notices for flights cancelled up to and including Wednesday September 20 have been sent to affected customers and we will continue to send regular updates and post flight information on our website," the airline said on Facebook.
"We have messed up in the planning of pilot holidays and we're working hard to fix that."
The airline said that less than 2 per cent of its flights would be cancelled.



As Papua New Guinea celebrates the 42nd anniversary of its independence from Australia, there are concerns the country's cultural products are being appropriated by overseas companies.
Women who sew the traditional "meri blouse", a type of dress introduced by missionaries, fear their industry is being undermined by cheap Asian imports.
They want rules to ensure cultural items can only be made in Papua New Guinea so they can keep earning an income.

"Those of us who worked in the market before used to make good money because there was not much competition," she said.
"Now there's lots of competition from other provinces and China — and this is why we don't make good money."

The meri blouse is normally worn to church, but the garment is also very popular for special occasions.
Ms Robert is proud of the ones she makes in the colours of PNG's national flag.
"We stitch it in black, white, yellow — and we print the bird of PNG and the star on it so that people will like it," she said.

The streets of PNG's towns and cities fill with vendors selling PNG-themed clothes in the lead-up to the country's Independence Day on September 16.
It provides valuable income for vendors like Dulsie Mathias, who profit from the patriotic fervour in the lead-up to the national day.
"We got Independence in 1975 and now PNG is a free country and we are coming to sell things about our day in September," she said.
The products Ms Mathias is selling are made in China, and her meri blouses are significantly cheaper than those made by the local cottage industry.

"We have all sorts of shapes and forms, PNG women, so I think the meri blouse covers and makes us look good," she said.
"I have a lot of customers who come — young women and up to older women as well."

There are some international conventions that aim to protect cultural items, and PNG does have legislation to prevent valuable artefacts and relics from being removed from the country.
But there is no specific protection for cultural products like meri blouses or other traditional costumes, which means they can be copied and manufactured overseas.

Ms Maliaki said the meri blouse was unique to PNG and should only made there.
"They can allow them to bring in some products — but such as PNG colours and all this, they should stop them, or put some kind of restriction on how much quantity should come into the country," she said.
"It really isn't fair when we are trying to make quality products, products we make with our own hands and skills."



Every year, millions of visitors flock to Kings Park to enjoy spectacular views of Perth and the Swan River or enjoy its unique wildflowers and flora.
But at least some of the extra attendees in a year of record visitation would not have looked up from their phones for long enough to notice any of that.
Last year's Pokemon Go craze was a big part of a sharp rise in attendance numbers to Kings Park during the financial year, with an estimated 6.3 million people visiting in total.
That was a 12.5 per cent improvement on the previous year and the highest on record.
In mid 2016, the 'Pokemon Go' phenomenon saw masses of people descend on the park to hunt "pocket monsters" lurking around the site.
"It was pretty crazy," Botanic Gardens and Park Authority executive director Marcelle Broderick said.
"We had an immense number of people all in pretty concentrated areas."

It was not all good for authorities, who had to deploy additional police and traffic management personnel during the craze and then spend tens of thousand of dollars replacing lawn and doing other repairs once it all died down.
Ms Broderick said Pokemon Go was not the only factor in the spike in attendance, saying the 'Boorna Waanginy' event which opened the Perth International Arts Festival in February also brought in large numbers of visitors.
Ms Borderick said day-to-day visitation was continually higher than in previous years.
"It is a sustained increase right through the year," she said.
"Of the 6.3 million visitors, about 82 per cent are local people, so the local community visits repeatedly and clearly loves and treasures Kings Park."
Other Perth landmarks achieved mixed attendance results for the 2016-17 financial year, according to figures provided to State Parliament.
At Perth Zoo, attendance fell 5 per cent from the record level the previous year but the facility still welcomed more than 650,000 visitors.
The WA Museum said 186,000 people attended its off-site exhibitions following the temporary closure of the CBD site last year.
A boost in the number of Perth residents heading to the Bell Tower took its attendance past 60,000, despite continued drops in the number of visitors from interstate and overseas.



Former defence minister David Johnston, who once declared he would not trust government shipyard ASC to "build a canoe", now believes the Adelaide-based company should play a major role in the construction of Australia's most high-tech warships.
In 2014, Mr Johnston could not hide his frustration with ASC's performance, but now the former Liberal senator is backing ASC and its West Australian partner Austal in a bid to win work on Australia's $35 billion Future Frigate program.
"The shipbuilders, the management of the yard, should be Australian," Mr Johnston told the ABC.
"We have a world-class shipbuilder in Austal, teaming with ASC who has come out of the doldrums — it had a lot of problems when I was the minister, a lot of problems, and now it's doing world-class work.
"Why are we not getting them to participate in this? I find it very, very curious."
Spanish company Navantia, UK firm BAE Systems and Italian shipbuilder Fincantieri have been shortlisted in a fierce competition to design, build and sustain nine new anti-submarine warfare frigates to replace Australia's existing Anzac frigate fleet.

Defence has warned any change to the current tender could delay the project by at least two years, but Mr Johnston questioned that argument.
"I'm surprised that the wording of the tender virtually excludes Australian actual builders — now, I don't understand why that is," he said.
"The skill and ability that I've talked of is there, is available for all to see, and can be utilised contractually — so this business of a two-year delay in the tender I find quite curious," he said.
ASC said it welcomed Mr Johnston's comments "as recognition of the enormous progress we have made in building Australia's most complex warships", adding its "performance has dramatically improved in recent years".


The last time the Australian dollar was this strong was two-and-a-half years ago. The commodity cycle has rolled over a couple of times since then.

Iron ore was down around $US40 a tonne in late 2015, back to $US90 earlier this year, followed by another stumble, and is now back close to $US80 again.
The dollar always seems to be playing catch-up, and at around 80 cents against the US dollar, opinions are very much divided as to which way it is heading from here.
For the bulls, the fundamentals are strong — it is going up. For sceptics, the dollar is overvalued and heading south.
HSBC's Paul Bloxham is bullish.
"Commodity prices have lifted off their trough, iron ore prices are sitting at higher levels, coal prices have lifted, and that reflects to a degree that global growth is also improving," he said.
"And so it makes sense that the Aussie dollar would also be lifting."
It could have a way to go yet. HSBC is predicting the Australian dollar will be trading around 90 US cents by mid next year.

While weakness in the US dollar has been a factor, Mr Bloxham believes the fundamentals in the local economy — and not just commodity prices — are strong.
"We think overall GDP growth in Australia will pick up into the second half of this year, we think that will start to generate a bit of upward pressure on wages, and a bit of upward pressure on inflation, and in turn we think that that will mean the Reserve Bank of Australia is lifting its cash rate from the early part of 2018," he said.
"All of those things factor in to why we think the Aussie dollar has lifted and why we think there is probably a bit more upside to the Aussie dollar in the short run."
But over at Westpac, senior currency strategist Robert Rennie has a different take.
"My models tend to tell me that above 80 to 82 cents the Australian dollar is expensive," he told The Business.
"And I think that's certainly consistent with the message that we got from the RBA."
Mr Rennie also said one of the factors had been a lower greenback, down about 10 per cent this year.
"And about 5 per cent of that [has been] since the beginning of June. And that probably has been one of the key drivers, and I think it probably explains about 40 per cent of the appreciation in the Australian dollar since the beginning of June," he said.
The weakness in the US dollar can be sheeted home to how investors feel about President Donald Trump.
He has promised business-friendly tax cuts and infrastructure spending that would drive demand for the US dollar, but in spite of controlling both houses, Mr Rennie said President Trump had been unable to deliver.
"The tremendous optimism that we had late last year, early this year, on the idea that we would see a significant run of growth-positive policy coming out of the Trump administration — clearly the fact that we've seen very little delivered so far has weighed on sentiment," he said.
The US central bank has imposed a handful of interest rate rises since 2015.
Now, Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen has signalled rates could stay lower for longer.
The threat of a rogue nuclear North Korea is also causing alarm in global markets.
For those going on overseas holidays or buying imported goods, a high Aussie dollar is good news — they'll get more for less.
But Australian exporters will find their products are more expensive for overseas buyers.
Key among those exports is commodities. Westpac is predicting prices will soften around the end of the year, putting downward pressure on the dollar.
"By the end of this year we've got the Australian dollar back down to 76 cents, and by the end of next year, back down to 70 cents," Mr Rennie said.
But HSBC's Mr Bloxham sees official interest rate rises on the cards in the next few months.
"FX [foreign exchange] markets are tending in recent times to move ahead of central banks, and so our view is that the Reserve Bank of Australia will be starting to lift its cash rate from the early part of next year," he said.
But lifting rates could push the dollar higher again, as foreign investors look to cash in on Australia's comparatively higher interest rates.
Exactly the opposite of what the Reserve Bank wants to see.


As the new media laws finally clambered over their last obstacle, you could almost hear the high-fives slapping in the boardrooms of the big — although somewhat diminished — media companies.

The denouement of the drawn-out and fraught process, televised on the Senate channel, had more the torn and frayed look of the Survivor franchise than the smoochy fairytale feel of The Bachelor, which aired around the same time.
So now the rule book has been rewritten, how is the game going to change? And is the promise of mergers and takeovers of struggling media businesses going to create new champions able to protect and expand their turf?
Certainly, the prospect of mergers is real — if for no other reason than: why did the media owners champion the changes in media ownership rules?
Will they be successful? That is an entirely different question.
It was not so much a rewriting of the Broadcasting Legislation Amendment Bill as just hitting delete on a couple of key provisions that changed things.
Out went the "75 per cent audience reach" rule prohibiting a TV network broadcasting to more than 75 per cent of the population.
It opens up possibilities for the likes of Seven, Nine, Ten and the regional players Prime, Southern Cross and WIN.
The removal of "two-from-three" rule — owning any two of TV, print and radio was OK, owning all three was not — is the one that puts everybody into play.
There are also bits like replacing TV and radio licence fees with a "spectrum fee", although they are unlikely to make much difference to the flow of deals in the wings.
However, that doesn't mean it is total open slather — some checks remain.
The "five/four rule" enshrined by the Howard government in 2007 to prevent the number of media owners falling below five in capital cities and four in regional areas, is still on the books, while the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission — with its own rule book — is still on the prowl looking to bust market domination.
To lesser extent, the Foreign Investment Review Board and shareholders themselves are in the mix, but they have never really been known to stop media takeovers.
A couple of times, shareholders have tried to stand in the way of a merger — to wit, a body of West Australian Newspaper investors against Kerry Stokes in 2011 and Ten investors at the moment — but they have generally been run over in the process.

The big investment bank, Morgan Stanley, has tallied up the permutations and combinations flowing from the law changes and has come up the most likely deals.
There are a fair few options, but for the sake of brevity, this is the short list of the bigger deals being discussed:
Nine and Southern Cross have previously said they've had discussions, but Nine's sale of its 10 per cent stake in the regional broadcaster was not seen as a positive step to a future takeover.
Would it create a bigger, stronger company? Morgan Stanley's Andrew McLeod thinks not.
"Bigger combined audience reach, yes, but higher growth and higher return on capital are questionable," Mr McLeod said.
So Fairfax and Nine? Far more plausible and powerful, according to Mr McLeod.
"This could be a rare opportunity to combine media assets and actually lift revenue growth rates via the two online businesses," he said.
"Nine's video content could strengthen Fairfax's online video capability and lift traffic and audiences for the Fairfax sites."
Importantly, Mr McLeod notes both companies have little or no debt, which is a big advantage in delivering a highly positive earning per share outcome to both sets of investors.
Seven has always been regarded as a natural predator for its regional partner Prime and now the reach rule has been removed, it is off the leash.
Given Prime is a reseller of Seven content, no-one else is likely to bid for it.
Does it make sense for Seven? Sort of, but Prime is a lean operation and the cost savings in merging the two may not be large enough to make it worthwhile, and the potential for ongoing earnings growth is minimal.
Talking about off the leash, News Corp has never been shy about buying businesses — good, bad or indifferent, profitable or unprofitable — it just buys them and considers the consequences and write-downs later.
Last month, it wrote down the value of sundry newspapers, its stake in Foxtel and the REA real estate portal by $1.3 billion. Although that is dwarfed by the impairments News Corp has racked up by buying the likes of Dow Jones and Gemstar over the years.
With its US rival CBS likely to snaffle Ten, News Corp could well turn its attention to Nine or Seven.
News already owns plenty of assets here and so any deal could be quite cost-effective or nerve-racking, depending on whether you are a shareholder or work in a newsroom facing further "rationalisation".
The merger of online businesses and picking up Nine or Seven video content would be handy for News Corp's digital platforms.
Of course, any move from News while OK under the new media laws would still need to leap any hurdle put in its way by the ACCC.
News could always satisfy itself with a tasty morsel like the $700 million Here, There & Everywhere radio network owner of brands such as KIIS and Gold, as well as the Adshel outdoor advertising business.
Earnings based on Morgan Stanley estimates of earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA).
The last significant media law changes in 2006 — largely centred on abolishing foreign ownership rules — certainly arced up deal making, both large and small.
It also sparked activity not held back by foreign ownership issues.
The then-Packer vehicle PBL sold half its media assets to the foreign private equity business CVC, proving you can have more than Alan Bond in your life.
Kerry Stokes also hooked up with private equity, this time Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts selling it a 50 per cent stake in his media assets including Seven and the magazine business for $3.2 billion. They are worth about a third of that today.
That deal allowed a cashed-up Mr Stokes to get a large foothold in, and ultimately control of, his hometown West Australian Newspapers.
Fairfax headed bush and bought Rural Press.
Morgan Stanley's Andrew McLeod says the experience of 2006 shows transactions could occur very quickly in 2017.
"Some of the remaining ownership rules, such as the 'five/four minimum voices' rule, present a first-mover advantage for consolidation occurring in some assets and some markets," he said.
The bigger question is whether any of this will create more robust businesses able to compete and grow against the likes of Facebook and Google in the ad market.
Unlike King Canute of yore, who stood in front of a tide to prove his fallibility knowing such things were beyond mere mortals, the Government is backing its plan to help turn back the digital tsunami crashing in from offshore and sweeping away local profits.
Good luck with that, says Mr McLeod.
"We think the key debate is whether on the other side of any merger and acquisition, higher growth/better quality media companies emerge — or if after one year's costs savings are banked, the downward trajectory in earnings and shareholder value resumes," he said.
"We can envisage a few genuine re-invention opportunities, but in most cases it's more likely the latter."

Last year Australian TV networks lost around $1 billion between them, newspapers have lost even more over recent years, while profitability in radio is flat-lining at best.
The test will be to achieve real top-line growth in sales, not just confected and unsustainable profit growth from cost-cutting.
The problem there is the advertising revenue pool is a bit of a zero sum game — with some GDP-style growth added in.
In such a relatively stagnant pool, gaining sales means someone is losing.
And on an exponential scale, the digital giants are winning and everyone else is losing.
The one thing the likes of Facebook and Google won't do is bail out Australian shareholders with an ill-considered purchase of an old economy business. They are not that dumb.



Bruce Gordon and Lachlan Murdoch have wasted no time in launching their latest bid to take over the struggling Ten Network.
This follows the Senate's passing of the media law reform bill on Thursday (by a vote of 31-27), thanks to crossbench support from One Nation and the Nick Xenophon Team.
This law would abolish the "two out of three" and "reach" rule which, together, prevent a company from owning a newspaper, TV and radio station in the same city, and from broadcasting to more than 75 per cent of the population.
Emboldened by this legislative development, the media moguls — through their private companies Biketu and Illyria — submitted a new proposal to Ten's administrators KordaMentha on Friday.
The terms of the revised Gordon-Murdoch offer are "compelling" for a number of reasons such as the fact is is now a "significantly lower transaction risk", according to the bid document reviewed by the ABC.
It is unclear at this stage whether KordaMentha will put the duo's joint bid for a vote at the second creditors' meeting next Tuesday (September 19).
Under their new offer, Mr Gordon and Mr Murdoch have increased their pool of cash for Ten's unsecured creditors by 57 per cent — from $35 million to $55 million.
This is higher than US media giant CBS's offer of $32 million, according to a supplementary report released by KordaMentha on Monday.
In addition, their private companies, Ten's employees and continuing trade creditors would receive 100c in the dollar, while all other creditors would get 5.75c in the dollar.

CBS, being Ten's largest creditor, would also receive a more generous deal in the new proposal — $20 million, or 5.75c in the dollar.
In comparison, the US media giant would receive a lower amount of $7.4 million under the original Gordon-Murdoch bid.
"Ten will remain listed on the ASX," Birketu and Illyria said in their latest proposal.
Ten's 17,000 shareholders would get to keep 25 per cent of their equity, and the network would be re-listed on the ASX. But under the CBS bid, the shareholders' holdings would be completely wiped out.
However, "all current shareholders in Ten (including all employee shareholders) will be diluted through the issue of [1.07 billion] options or shares" to Mr Gordon's and Mr Murdoch's private companies, according to the new proposal.
The additional shares or options would also give them a combined 75 per cent stake in Ten.
As for how this revised offer of $55 million would be funded, it would be through a new debt facility, which is expected to be provided by Commonwealth Bank, and guaranteed by Mr Gordon and Mr Murdoch. But it is not yet know how much this debt facility is worth.
Mr Gordon has already succeeded in delaying the second creditors' meeting, originally scheduled on September 12, this Tuesday, through his Supreme Court action against the administrators.
In the court action, Mr Gordon sought a declaration from Justice Ashley Black that KordaMentha's creditors' report was deficient, and failed to give adequate information about his joint bid with Mr Murdoch.
They are also seeking orders for the weighting of CBS's vote to be reduced to $1. That would significantly hamper CBS's ability to vote on its own offer at next week's creditors' meeting.
The Supreme Court of NSW will hand down its decision on Monday morning — the day before the second creditors' meeting.


Financial Services Minister Kelly O'Dwyer has rejected claims that reintroduced legislation to overhaul the governance of superannuation funds is ideological.

The laws were quietly introduced on Thursday amid the noise from last-minute negotiations to strike a deal on media law reforms, and the release of previously confidential papers of former High Court judge Lionel Murphy.
A key proposal in the legislation is to force industry boards to ensure a third of trustees are independent and that an independent chairman is appointed,
Ms O'Dwyer said claims by union-backed industry super funds that the Government was pursuing an ideological dispute were a diversion from the need to protect the interests of members.
"It's not ideological at all. This is a massive distraction from the main game," she said.
"You've got people within some of these [industry] funds who I would suggest are very ideological themselves.
"The package of reforms that the Government is bringing forward applies equally across the sector to all funds, whether they're retail, industry or corporate funds.
"This is important because we force people to put money aside from their wages to provide for their retirement income, and people need to know that money is protected."

The Federal Government has been struggling to pass legislation since its proposed reforms were blocked by the Senate in December 2015.
Ms O'Dwyer has been the latest minister charged with pushing through the reforms, after similar moves by her predecessors Josh Frydenberg and Arthur Sinodinos were stalled.
Industry Super Australia has accused the Government of caving in to pressure from retail funds to dismantle the current governance of super funds.
Chief executive David Whiteley said the Government was giving banks a "leave pass" on transparency and disclosure requirements.
"Rather than dealing with the big issues like the superannuation gender gap and unpaid superannuation, it appears the Government has caved in, dismantling the successful industry super governance model," he said.
Industry Super Australia has been running an advertising campaign in recent months likening retail superannuation funds to foxes in the henhouse.
The three bills introduced would provide greater oversight of Australia's $2.3 trillion superannuation sector, handing greater powers to the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA), and giving workers the right to choose their own fund.

As Malcolm Turnbull concluded his final answer during Question Time on Thursday, after two weeks of political rough and tumble, his backbench literally thumped their desks in support.
It was a rare sight for a party which usually spends way too much time staring despondently at their phones, led by a man who, since taking on the job of Prime Minister two years ago, has fallen well short of voters' expectations.
Just before Question Time got underway, the PM had gathered his troops in the atrium adjoining the chamber to congratulate them for their efforts over the gruelling fortnight in Canberra.
He was right to do so.
It has in fact been one of his best parliamentary sessions in many months.
The week ended with the Senate passing the full suite of media reforms that previous governments have been trying to land for many, many years.
"It is another example of making the 45th Parliament work," the Prime Minister beamed from the courtyard outside his Parliamentary office.

A strong finish for a Government that began the fortnight in the grip of chaos.
Labor had gone the nuclear option on Barnaby Joyce's citizenship status, disrupting every day of last week's Parliament with gag motions and attempts to suspend debate.
But the Tony Abbott-inspired tactic hurt Labor as much as the Government and this week the Opposition finally stepped onto the Coalition's preferred battleground.
Rather than the citizenship crisis and the divisive issue of same-sex marriage, the Government and Opposition became fully engaged on the issue of energy.
The Government wants to be seen to be fighting on behalf of voters who are paying too much for electricity.
Hence AGL boss Andy Vesey became the latest energy executive to be hauled unceremoniously to Canberra for a stern talking to.
Energy Minister Josh Frydenberg went toe-to-toe with Labor's Joel Fitzgibbon in the corridors of the press gallery. And the Government continued its puerile attacks on "Blackout Bill" Shorten, "Brownout [Mark] Butler" and "No Coal Joel" Fitzgibbon.
It doesn't seem matter to them who they're fighting, as long as they're seen to be taking up arms.

For now, it's a tactic that is working for the Government, but several members of Cabinet are concerned about the longer-term risks.
All pretence of an "energy trilemma" has now been dropped.
Consideration of low carbon emissions now comes a distant third to power prices and reliability of supply.
In fact, a sizable number of MPs believe the Chief Scientist's preferred option of a Clean Energy Target is now "dead".
But with nothing to replace it, the uncertainty that continues to repel potential investors in the energy sector remains, as does the risk of price spikes and blackouts.
The Federal Government has fought all year to take ownership of energy, an issue that used to be the domain of the states.
Now Mr Turnbull owns a big and complex problem.
If he actually delivers lower power bills and reliability of supply, while meeting our Paris climate commitments, he'll be seen in a very good light indeed.
But if there are blackouts this summer and further electricity price spikes to come, he'll rightly cop the blame and this fortnight's tactical win in Parliament will mean nothing.


A group of women has brought a class action against Australia's largest cosmetic surgery provider, The Cosmetic Institute (TCI), alleging negligence during breast augmentation procedures left them with life-threatening complications.

The case, filed in the New South Wales Supreme Court, claims TCI breached its duty of care to patients by utilising a "one size fits all" approach to breast augmentations.
A statement of claim also alleges the company's staff lacked the capacity to access urgent medical assistance in emergencies, and the clinics did not have adequate infection controls.
"These women have suffered a range of complications including cardiac arrests from toxic doses of anaesthesia, lung punctures, infections, and physical disfigurement," said lawyer Sally Gleeson from Turner Freeman.
One of the five lead applicants is a Western Australian woman who in 2015 went into cardiac arrest during a breast augmentation at TCI's Parramatta clinic.
The other participants include a New South Wales woman who suffered seizures during her procedure, and a Queensland student who required emergency surgery after developing a severe post-operative infection.
"The Cosmetic Institute has left a trail of victims who were promised top-quality cosmetic surgery in a highly advanced medical setting, but instead have suffered serious injuries and ongoing pain and suffering as a result of their treatment," Ms Gleeson said.
The class action also alleges TCI used identical surgical techniques on almost all patients, regardless of their size or breast shape, which has resulted in poorly positioned implants and scarring.

The Cosmetic Institute describes itself as the "largest" breast enhancement clinic in Australia.
It has clinics in Sydney, the Gold Coast and Melbourne, offering breast augmentations for $5,990.
Last year, the New South Wales Health Care Complaints Commission investigation found The Cosmetic Institute appeared to be giving high doses of anaesthetic to patients without their consent.
"Adrenaline was used routinely (in combination with local anaesthetic agents) ... at well above the accepted upper limit of safe dosage," the report found.
It found the clinics "placed the health and safety of members of the public at risk".
Ms Gleeson told the ABC she's been approached by several hundred women who were unhappy with their surgeries at TCI since 2014.
"If we take TCI's claims on their website to be accurate, they have performed breast augmentations on thousands of women, so I wouldn't be surprised if more women continue to come forward," she said.
"Every patient deserves competent treatment and follow up care. This class action is about delivering justice for this large group of women who continue to suffer from the impact of TCI's failures to appropriately and safely carry out these procedures."
Turner Freeman said TCI patients who have had complications could still join the class action suit.
The Cosmetic Institute said it would not be discussing the case publicly.
"Should this matter proceed, we will be defending any allegations made against TCI," the company said in a statement to the ABC.


Clive Palmer says his nephew Clive Mensink is still being paid more than $4,000 per week by his companies, while the subject of two arrest warrants.
The Federal Court issued the arrest warrants for Mr Mensink, a former Queensland Nickel director, in March, after he failed to show up to answer questions about the collapse of Queensland Nickel.
Mr Palmer is giving evidence before the Queensland Supreme Court as part of a two-day hearing where taxpayer-funded liquidators are trying to freeze his assets amid a $500 million court case to claw back debts to Queensland Nickel creditors and sacked workers.
He told the court in May he was not aware of any payments to Mr Mensink, but on Friday testified he was "heavily sedated at the time".
During the appearance in May, Mr Palmer hobbled into court clutching a sick bag, a breathing apparatus and pillow, claiming he was taking medication that caused memory loss.
Today, Mr Palmer admitted Mr Mensink is entitled to a wage of more than $200,000.
"That would be a precise figure that he's entitled to," he said.
"He'd be paid for three years [after his contract ended], he was entitled to receive his salary.

"I recall being aware of it, I was aware he was being paid his salary and would continue to be paid."
When asked if he was responsible for the change of payment from Queensland Nickel Sales to Mineralogy, Mr Palmer said it did not matter what company the money came from.
The court heard Mr Mensink was being paid through Queensland Nickel Sales until March, but then continued to be paid the same figure by Mr Palmer's flagship company, Mineralogy.
"It all comes from me," he said.
"I'm the only source of cash."
Queensland Nickel collapsed last January with $300 million in debt, and more than 800 people lost their jobs.
Outside court Mr Palmer said he did not think it was unfair Mr Mensink was still paid while Queensland Nickel workers were sacked.
"No, I think they're two separate things, these issues will be dealt with in the court," he said.
"The reality of it is, Mr Mensink is entitled to his normal payments as any other worker would be and that's paid and that's guaranteed by Mineralogy, and it's guaranteed by Queensland Nickel Sales."
"We've got no legal ability to stop payments to anybody."
Mr Palmer told the court in May, Mr Mensink was on an extended overseas holiday and he last spoke to Mr Mensink while he was in the Caribbean on a cruise last year.
The court also heard Mr Palmer's father-in-law "coincidently" bumped into Mr Mensink twice overseas, once on a Caribbean cruise and once in the Bulgarian capital Sofia in February.
Barrister Shane Doyle QC, acting for the liquidators, then asked if he was aware of the change.
"I personally wasn't," Mr Palmer responded.
"But I agreed he should be paid, and continue to be paid three years after his termination."
Mr Doyle also asked Mr Palmer whether Mr Mensink still worked for some of his companies.
Mr Palmer responded he was not sure but he thought Mr Mensink ceased being a director of the companies in December 2016.
Mr Palmer said he did not think Mr Mensink had a fugitive status.
"You can't take from people their property and their entitlement unless you do it under a court order," he said.


Taxpayers are forking out at least $40 million to buy the beleaguered Heyfield timber mill in Gippsland, with the existing management becoming a shareholder along with the Victorian Government.
The Government has finally signed a deal to buy the business, after Premier Daniel Andrews made the extraordinary decision to buy the mill in July.
Under the arrangement, Australian Sustainable Hardwoods will continue to operate under the ownership of the Government and a shareholder group made up of the mill's management.
The Government has not said how much taxpayers have paid to buy the business but it is understood at least $40 million has been paid.
The previous owners threatened to close the plant after the state-owned VicForests provided a smaller-than-expected timber supply to the business, due to dwindling supply from the environmentally and politically sensitive central highlands.

The decreased supply was due to areas of native forest being locked up because of Leadbeater's Possum protection zones and bushfire damage to suitable forests.
The mill processes mountain ash hardwoods, and the owners said the supply offer was not viable to keep the business running.
The Hermal group, which owned the mill, wanted a supply of 150,000 cubic metres but only 80,000m3 was offered.
Up to 250 jobs were at risk and there will still be job losses under the Government bailout.

The Andrews Government believes the business can operate on a smaller supply and, with the mill sitting in already-under-pressure Gippsland, it decided to buy the business.
Employment Minister Wade Noonan will oversee the transition and the establishment of a new corporate structure.
Mr Noonan said Labor was fulfilling its promise to stand up for local jobs.
"We have secured the future of this mill — saving jobs, protecting the timber industry and ensuring the local Heyfield economy is supported into the future," he said.
Conservationists have railed against logging in the central highlands and have recently argued the forests are critical to Melbourne's water supply and the Yarra Valley tourism industry.
The industry has argued for more timber to be made available, including by reducing buffer zones for possums.
The Opposition accused the Government of misleading the people of Heyfield due to mixed messages abut how many jobs would be saved.
Local MP Tim Bull said the Government should open up more timber supply.
"These jobs wouldn't have needed saving if Labor hadn't refused to guarantee a viable timber supply,'' he said.
"Daniel Andrews is so desperate to secure Greens preferences and the seats of his inner-city MPs that he is willing to sacrifice those in our east Gippsland communities."
The decision to buy the mill prompted environmentalists to call on the Andrews Government to create a Great Forest national park.
The Wilderness Society said now the Heyfield matter was resolved, the Premier should turn his attention to the environment.

"The Andrews Government was elected on a platform of delivering outcomes for forests, workers, industry and wildlife," its spokeswoman Amelia Young said.
"The Wilderness Society has been repeatedly informed that uncertainty over the Heyfield sawmill was preventing action on protecting forests.
"Now that the Heyfield sawmill sale has been finalised, Premier Andrews must immediately commence a process to create new national parks in this term of office."
The Victorian Association of Forest Industries chief executive Tim Johnston welcomed the Government's move.
"The forest, fibre and wood products industry is the lifeblood of many rural and regional communities across Victoria," he said.
"It is a $7 billion industry that employs 21,000 Victorians and supports another 40,000 to 50,000 local jobs, many of these in regional areas."


Google is being accused by three former female employees in California of discrimination against women within the workplace.

The women have filed a lawsuit against the US company, in the latest allegation of sexual discrimination in Silicon Valley.
They have claimed they were paid significantly less compared to their male counterparts, and that they were put into positions with fewer promotions.
It comes as the US Department of Labor investigates whether the company has been discriminating against women.
Anne Shaver, one of the lawyers representing the women, said while Google had faced individual gender discrimination before, this was the first time a class action had been filed against them.
"The main complaint here is simple, it's that women at Google are not receiving equal pay for equal work," she said.
According to the complaints document, the women have gone as far as claiming Google 'segregated women within the workplace'.
"They put into user interface roles, instead of product development and so forth," Ms Shaver said.
"These distinctions are drawn within the company that really have an effect on women's job opportunities and women compensation in particular."

All three plaintiffs — Kelly Ellis, Holly Pease and  Kelli Wisuri — held senior positions within the company.
The lead plaintiff on the case, Ms Ellis, was hired in 2010 by Google as a frontend software engineer as part of the Google photos team and was offered the same base salary as her previous job.
At the time of her hiring, she had four years' experience working in the same field.
According to the suit, she was placed in a Level three software engineering ladder, the level which Google typically assigns to new college graduates.
Within a few weeks of Ms Ellis's time at Google, the company hired a male software engineer onto her team with similar qualifications as Ms Ellis, yet he was placed into the higher-paying Level 4 ladder.
At Google, Level 4 software engineers receive substantially higher salaries and more opportunities for bonuses, raises and equity.
Ms Ellis's claim is that when she initially applied for a promotion, Google denied her application despite the company acknowledging her excellent performance.
Eventually Ms Ellis obtained the Level 4 position, however by that time, the suit says her male counterparts had already moved up the ladder, "ensuring she could never catch up on the gender pay gap".
Ms Pease and Ms Wisuri had similar stories of being held back and placed on lower-paying career tracks.
Ms Shaver said if the case became certified as a class action, it would include thousands of female employees across the state of California.
"We don't know yet the exact number of employees that it will affect," she said.
"But we do know that Google employs tens and thousands of workers in California — so the number will be large."
Ms Shaver said the goal was the lawsuit would eventually have repercussions throughout the tech industry, such as in the way companies assigned jobs and compensate employees.
"We're hoping that will take the effect, not just in California of course, but throughout the company," she said.
"Our hope is that this lawsuit will really echo throughout Silicon Valley as a result of Google's prominence."
In a statement, Google said job levels and promotions were, "determined through rigorous hiring and promotion committees".
"And must pass multiple levels of review, including checks to make sure there is no gender bias in these decisions," the statement said.
"If we ever see individual discrepancies or problems, we work to fix them, because Google has always sought to be a great employer, for every one of our employees."
The latest in legal pressure on Google has been closely observed by women in the Australian tech industry.

Taryn Williams launched her own startup, The Right Fit, and is on the board of industry group TechSydney.
"[It's] definitely been something that's been discussed at length in the tech scene, especially in Sydney," she said.
"I think it's really great that people have been publicly voicing their opinions and really getting out and putting their support behind the women in tech."
And it's a timely reminder for tech companies in Australia.
"In our space in technology there's a vast underrepresentation of women, that's partly due to a pipeline problem," Ms Williams said.
"But potentially also because of problems like this.
"If there are massive pay gaps and if there are internal hiring processes that prevent women from getting promotions, from being hired into positions in the first place, then that's definitely something we need to … closely address."


Energy shares and rebounding oil prices were behind the gains on US and European stock markets overnight.

But it was an otherwise lacklustre day for the world's major equity indexes, which mainly finished lower.
One notable exception was the Dow Jones which, for the third straight day, closed at a fresh record — up just 0.2 per cent to 22,203.
Aside from energy, the other top-performing sector in the US was utilities. Though half the other sectors were sold-off by investors.
The key energy stocks which boosted the Dow were Exxon Mobil (up 0.4 pc to $US80.09), and Chevron (up 0.24 pc to $US114.45). Boeing shares also propelled this index, with the aviation company gaining 1.36 per cent to $US245.23.
However, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq took a dive, as higher-than-expected inflation figures raised the likelihood of US interest rates rising by the end of 2017.
The consumer price index rose 0.4 per cent in August over the previous month. On a year-over-year basis, the cost of living in America increased by 1.9 per cent.
An uplift in gasoline prices and rent costs were the main factors driving inflation higher.
Now the probability of the Federal Reserve announcing its third rate hike for the year lifted to about 52 per cent, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool.
Meanwhile, the Bank of England signalled its first interest rate hike in a decade might happen in the "coming months".
The bank's policymakers, by a 7-2 majority, voted on Thursday to keep rates on hold at their record-low 0.25 per cent, which was widely expected.
The BOE also released new guidance which raised the sterling to a one-year high against the US dollar.
Expectations of a UK rate hike by the end of the year lifted to more than 50 per cent.
The British economy looked closer to running at full capacity, with rising wages and employment levels, which boosted inflation pressures, the BOE said.
Most of the BOE's policymakers felt, "some withdrawal of monetary stimulus was likely to be appropriate over the coming months" — if the economic trends continued.
It will be a quiet day in economic news, as no new data will be released today.
The Australian dollar was steady at two-year high levels — hovering between 79.5 and 80.4 US cents since Thursday afternoon.
Furthermore, Australia's key export, iron ore plunged 3.4 per cent on the back of weaker economic data from China.
China's home sales rose 3.8 per cent in August, its slowest pace since November 2014.
"Growth in industrial production also fell to 6 per cent, versus expectations of 6.6 per cent," ANZ's head of Australian economics, David Plank, said.
"However, demand for raw materials appears to remain strong."


There's plenty of advice out there for first home buyers and other mortgage borrowers on how to get a loan.
But it's easy to overlook how people get into situations where they borrow more than they can afford to repay.
Here's why you should be wary about applying for a loan before you have run your own numbers.
A mainstream lender will look at a client's income after tax to determine the value of the mortgage loan.
They also take into account a client's expenses — including other mortgages, car loans and credit card repayments — as well as the client's living expenses and deposit amount.
These are the main things they're looking for:
Lenders are also required to apply a base interest rate percentage figure to loan repayments that is about 2 per cent over the loan interest rate or about 7 per cent in total.
For example, if a person is being offered a 4 per cent loan, the lender will "assess the amount that can be borrowed based on an interest rate of about 7 per cent," Sydney-based mortgage broker Bruce Carr from Loanscape said.

Mortgage brokers must act according to the responsible lending conduct set out by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission in The National Credit Act.

Under these requirements, credit licensees must not enter into a credit contract or consumer lease with a consumer, suggest a credit contract or consumer lease to a consumer or assist a consumer to apply for a credit contract or consumer lease if the credit contract or consumer lease is unsuitable for the consumer.
But as Four Corners pointed out a couple of weeks ago, all the big banks have performance targets. That means they need to "sell" a lot of home loans.
"There have been people in the industry who have been lending clients too much money, encouraging them to borrow more than what they can comfortably afford," former mortgage broker Philip Dempsey told the program.
In its review of mortgage broker remuneration, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission found that loans provided through the broker channel are on average larger and have a higher loan-to-valuation ratio (LVR) than loans provideddirectly through lenders.

It also identified "significant numbers of loans across several lenders where the consumer expenses were stated to be equal to the HEM benchmark".
"The proportion of loans we reviewed where the consumer's expenses were equal to or very close to the HEM benchmark suggests that [inquiries into the consumer's actual expenses] were not occurring properly," it noted.
In fact, a recent UBS survey of more than 900 people who took out home loans found a quarter of respondents said their loan application was only "mostly factual and accurate".
They found that the most common lie was understating living costs, while understating other debts or overstating income or assets each accounted for around 15 per cent of misrepresentations.
So if people are giving inaccurate information, then it is possible that they could be borrowing more than they can afford to repay.
This lines up with what Consumer Action Law Centre senior policy officer Katherine Temple says the centre had been hearing from clients.
"What we have seen is there hasn't been a proper assessment of people's income and expenses and this has led to people having more debt than they can pay back," Ms Temple said.
"… So, what we have seen is people perhaps overstating what they earn and maybe underestimating their expenses and this information not being properly verified by the banks."
Not without a guarantor. There was a time when people could borrow 100 per cent loans, but the requirements to access these loans have been tightened by the banks in the last few years.

Australians can no longer access no deposit home loans from a bank without a guarantor (for example, your parents provide a guarantee with their own property).
Most banks suggest borrowers save a 20 per cent deposit.
In some cases, a range of lenders still offer loans for 95 per cent of the purchase price, according to Home Loan Experts.
The criteria for these loans is much harder, with borrowers required to have a clear credit history, a good income, minimal debts and stable employment.
You'll also likely have to pay a lenders mortgage insurance premium because these loans are deemed to be "high risk".
You might be asking yourself, 'who would borrow a "high risk" loan?' But as Ms Temple point out, borrowers can fall into an "optimism bias".

"There's been a lot of research around the behavioural biases that can impact our borrowing behaviour and one of them is the optimism bias," Ms Temple said.
"We are often more optimistic about what we earn and also about our expenses then perhaps the reality and that's a bias all of us are subject to."
It's not only the banks who lose out if you fail to account for unseen expenses or future rate rises.
Mr Carr suggests borrowers do their own sums, taking into account future interest rate rises before applying for a loan — even if most banks now use a buffer rate as part of their loan assessment.
"Say you had an investment property home loan, all the property investment loans were being assessed at say a 4 per cent [actual repayment] rate," he said.
"And now they're all being assessed at 7.25 rate … that's a significant change and it's only flowed through in the last 12 months or so. And the biggest impact has been on multiple property investors."
Along with the obvious tasks of doing a budget and taking into account the risk that interest rates will rise and that house prices will fall, Ms Temple suggests also looking at circumstances where "things don't go to plan".
"You also need to take into account the risk of illness, losing your job, or something [else] going wrong," she said.
"A lot of the people who call us are not necessarily bad with money, but something has happened in their lives that has caused them hardship and it has led to them being in financial stress — a relationship breakdown, etc — so it's important to have a buffer when something goes wrong."


A public inquiry into a fire that killed at least 80 people at London's Grenfell Tower will get to the truth about the tragedy, its chairman pledged at the opening, but critics say survivors of the blaze are still being failed.

The 24-storey social housing block, home to a poor, multi-ethnic community, was gutted on June 14 in an inferno that started in a fourth-floor apartment in the middle of the night and quickly engulfed the building.
Grenfell Tower was part of a deprived housing estate in Kensington and Chelsea, one of the richest boroughs in London, and the disaster has prompted a national debate about social inequality and government neglect of poor communities.
The inquiry started with a minute's silence to honour the victims, whose exact number remains unknown because of the devastation inside the tower.
"[The inquiry] can and will provide answers to the pressing questions of how a disaster of this kind could occur in 21st century London," its chairman, retired judge Martin Moore-Bick, said in his opening statement.
He said the inquiry was not there to punish anyone or to award compensation, but to get to the truth.
A separate police investigation is underway, which could result in manslaughter charges. There have been no arrests.
The inquiry will examine the cause and spread of the fire, the design, construction and refurbishment of the tower, whether fire regulations relating to high-rise buildings are adequate and whether they were complied with. It will also look at the actions of the authorities before and after the tragedy.

But critics warned of a disconnect between the technical, legalistic inquiry process and the ongoing ordeal of traumatised Grenfell Tower residents still awaiting new homes.
Prime Minister Theresa May pledged all families whose homes were destroyed in the fire would be rehoused within three weeks, but three months later most still live in hotels.
Just three out of 197 households that needed rehousing have moved into permanent homes, while 29 have moved into temporary accommodation.
"We lost everything. It's difficult for the other people to be in our shoes," Miguel Alves, who escaped his 13th-floor apartment in Grenfell Tower with his family, told reporters.
"Now I'm without anything, I'm in the hotel, I have to cope with my family. My daughter, she just started school. They need some stability and that I cannot give to my family."

Emma Dent Coad, a member of parliament from the opposition Labour Party who represents the area, said the inquiry's remit was too narrow and would fail to address the blaze's deeper causes, such as failings in social housing policies.
She also criticised the choice of venue for Judge Moore-Bick's opening statement, a lavishly decorated room in central London.
"We were sitting in a ballroom dripping with chandeliers," she said.
"I think it was the most incredibly inappropriate place to have something like that, and actually says it all about the us-and-them divide that people see."
Many of those affected have also expressed disquiet about the fact Judge Moore-Bick and the other lawyers appointed to run the inquiry are all white and part of a perceived "establishment" far removed from their own circumstances.

"The experience of many residents of that tower is that they were ignored because of their immigration status," lawyer Jolyon Maugham, who is advising some residents, said.
"We need someone on the inquiry team that can speak to that experience and at the moment on the panel we have a bunch of white privileged barristers," he said.
One of the difficulties facing the inquiry is that it needs former residents to give evidence but some fear possible deportation.
The government has said it would grant a 12-month amnesty to anyone affected by the fire who was in Britain illegally.
Supporters say only permanent residency rights will persuade people to come forward.




The sale of 29,000 hectares of hardwood plantations is a great outcome for Tasmania, the Government says, but Labor, the Greens and environmental groups are not sold.
Resources Minister Guy Barnett spruiked the $60.7 million sale to Reliance Forest Fibre, as a deal that will allow Sustainable Timber Tasmania to become debt-free and commercially viable while also promoting local jobs.

Mr Barnett told Parliament the announcement was consistent with the government's "plans for a sustainable future which will deliver confidence and growth and opportunity for Tasmania's forest industry."
"The transaction will result in diversification of ownership in the forestry sector, bringing global expertise in capital to Tasmania ... creating more jobs," he said.
The Government described Reliance Forest Fibre as a "new enterprise owned by investment funds advised by Global Forest Partners (GFP) LP".
"Global Forest Partners is an international forest investment advisory firm with approximately 700,000 ha of timberland across the globe under management, valued at around $3.7 billion," it said.
But the Greens said Reliance Forest Fibre was only registered in July, with ASIC documents showing it's holding company Global Forest Partners LP has links offshore.
"Their parent company is based in a tax haven in the Cayman Islands, so there are legitimate questions to be asked about this company," Greens Leader Cassy O'Connor said.
Ms O'Connor pointed to a 2012 letter from the Auditor-General conservatively estimated the 29,000 hectares to be worth at least $101 million.
"The Tasmanian people have been ripped off," she said.
"It's an absolute betrayal of the Premier's promise to the Tasmanian people that his government wouldn't privatise public assets."
The Labor Opposition said Tasmanian's could have reasonably expected the plantations to sell for close to $200 million.
The Wilderness Society also said taxpayers had been dudded.
"Flogging off publicly owned plantations at a massive loss to subsidise unviable native forest logging operations is a desperate last-ditch effort to hide the ongoing failures of Premier (Will) Hodgman's chaotic approach to forestry," Vica Bayley of the Wilderness Society said.
While this is GFP's first venture into Tasmania, the international timber giant has operated in Australia since 1999.
The US-owned multinational corporation currently managed funds that hold about 150,000 planted hectares on mainland Australia.
Health Minister Michael Ferguson said there shouldn't be any doubt over the buyer.
"The Greens are fruiting this up, it's silly, where the parent of parent company is based is irrelevant," Mr Ferguson said.
"This is a robust deal, the money is real money and it's an investment in our state and it means that jobs will remain in our state.
"This has been an appropriately arms-length negotiation and process."
He said the majority of the proceeds from the sale would go to paying down Sustainable Timber Tasmania's debt, with around $15 million to be spent on the health system.
"We'll continue to do our work to employ more staff and to open more resources including beds, so we can meet demand and give Tasmanians the health system we know they deserve," Mr Ferguson said.
The company issued a statement late on Thursday reaffirming its commitment to employing local management and contractors.
The statement also said the new enterprise was committed to sound environmental management and will seek independent forest management certification.


An independent review into the deeply troubled accountancy organisation CPA Australia has found the former chief executive was overpaid, it had lost touch with its members and provided questionable value for money for the services it rendered.

While much of the interim report had elements of "tell us something we don't know" for anyone following the implosion of the profile-obsessed professional body, it did make recommendations to overhaul corporate governance and practices.
The review, headed by former federal auditor general Ian McPhee, was established as the previous CPA board collapsed and before the under siege former CEO Alex Malley was shown the door with a $4.9 million pay out.
"It is fair to say that, over time, the Board and the then CEO lost touch with a large cohort of the membership of CPA Australia," the review noted.
"When under pressure, the board and CPA Australia has commonly defaulted to the minimum standard of disclosure.
"This has occurred in response to significant issues raised by members and the media, rather than giving emphasis to transparency and the likely interests of the membership."
In what is in the running for corporate Australia's understatement of the year, the review found "the board could have handled things better".

By the end of the debacle, seven of the twelve member board had quit, making it impossible to form a quorum at meetings.
Despite these glaring failings, the review found the remuneration of the boards of CPA Australia and its new and loss making financial planning wing, CPA Advice, were "above the expectations of many members and those of benchmarked member-based organisations".
The $4.9 million payout to Mr Malley — the equivalent to three years of an already healthy wage — was well above what would be considered standard for a CEO position while senior CPA executives were "paid more than comparable positions at other member-based organisations".
While the review found the objectives and spending of the CPA's $30 million marketing budget were compatible with other professional organisations, it questioned the wisdom of large sports sponsorships, such as underwriting the National Basketball League, and the overemphasis on promoting Mr Malley.
CPA Australia members paid for Mr Malley's commercial TV chat show and a heavily promoted autobiography featured in airport lobbies and on Melbourne trams.

It also questioned holding this year's annual general meeting in Singapore where members did not have real-time participation despite live streaming being provided.
The review also noted considerable disgruntlement with members about the value they received from fees paid.
"Some members have indicated that there is a misalignment between services and membership costs," it said.
"In particular, that the cost of professional development and training is also perceived as being too high."
It also noted, "on occasions, interactions between staff and members have not always been constructive and respectful and, at times, have been detrimental".
The review suggested a charter explicitly governing standards of behaviour — common in other organisations — should be adopted.
It also recommended the maximum term for CPA directors be cut from nine years to six.
The final report from the review is expected to be released in December.


A new plastic 10 pound note featuring renowned author Jane Austen has gone into circulation in Britain.
Austen is the first female writer to feature on a British banknote, replacing a paper 10 pound note which featured a portrait of naturalist Charles Darwin.
The new 'tenner' is the first British banknote with a tactile feature involving a series of raised dots in the top left-hand corner to help blind and partially sighted users.
The move coincides with the 200th anniversary of the author's death and comes more than a year after Australia circulated its new $5 bank notes, whose new features also enabled vision-impaired people to read the currency.

In an address at Winchester Cathedral, Bank of England governor Mark Carney revealed why Austen had been selected.
"Austen's novels have a universal appeal and speak as powerfully today as they did when they were first published," he said.
The circulation of the new notes follows a four-month period when women, apart from the Queen, have not been represented on the Bank's notes, the BBC noted.
The last was the 5 pound note featuring reformer Elizabeth Fry, which was replaced last year by a fiver showcasing Winston Churchill.
The choice of quote was met with some confusion when it was announced.
It's a line out of Pride and Prejudice, no doubt one of Austen's most iconic works, "I declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading!".
But some Janeites were quick to point out that the quote, from Caroline Bingley, was not sincere.

Just over 1 billion of the notes have been printed and the general public should start seeing them over coming days and weeks.

The Bank of England said it would gradually start withdrawing the roughly 800 million 10 pound paper notes in circulation as they are banked by retailers and businesses.
The old notes will still be accepted in the shops until Spring 2018 with the exact date of withdrawal to be published three months in advance.
Mr Carney said banknotes serve as "repositories of the country's collective memory, promoting awareness of the United Kingdom's glorious history and highlighting the contributions of its greatest citizens."

After more than 100 years of discussion around building a cable car on the mountain backdrop of Hobart, the Tasmanian Government is confident its reality is a step closer.

Legislation allowing the State Government to compulsorily acquire land from the Hobart City Council for a cable car project on Mount Wellington, also known by its Aboriginal name kunanyi, passed the Lower House on Thursday night, with the support of Labor.
The much-discussed project was stalled in approval processes by the council, prompting the Government to intervene.
Matthew Groom, Minister for State Growth, said the bill's passage was an important milestone.
"It represents the most significant step forward in allowing the public to have their say on such a project in more than 100 years," Mr Groom said.
Premier Will Hodgman said normal approval processes would still apply.
"It does not in any way allow anyone, this government or a future government to flog off public land as the Greens would assert," he said.
"If we're going to continue the growth, the sustainable growth in our tourism industry we need to continually add new attractions and new points of interest that separate Tasmania from the pack."
The bill now moves to the Legislative Council for consideration.
Proponents of the project are collecting signatures for a petition they plan to put to the Upper House in support of the project.

Opposition Leader Rebecca White was the only Labor member to speak during the debate.
"We support alternative modes of transport on Mt Wellington including a cable car," she said.
"We recognise the bill the Government has put forward doesn't dictate a particular route or a particular proponent."
Labor also called for the public road on Mt Wellington to remain open to the public and properly maintained, which the Government agreed to.
But Greens leader Cassy O'Connor said the bill set out to "commercialise wilderness".

"We won't be supporting this nasty piece of legislation which enables a land grab for a private developer at public expense," she said.
"There is nothing public about a privately owned cable car. It's a complete distortion of the intent of the Land Acquisition Act."
The Greens again raised Mr Groom's relationship with Adrian Bold, who is behind the latest push for a cable car development.
In an exchange with Ms O'Connor that prompted laughter within the chamber, Mr Groom moved to quell any concerns.
"I'll just make this point to you Ms O'Connor, you are a closer personal friend of mine than Adrian Bold," he said.
"I'm sure he wouldn't mind me saying it. I've had more private drinks with you than I have with Adrian Bold."
Ms O'Connor could be heard interjecting with the words "offensive" and "unbecoming", also taking aim at Labor's support.
The Mt Wellington Cable Car Company posted a statement on its Facebook page reacting to the bill's passage.
"We are very glad to be able to strengthen investor confidence in the project with this strong bi-partisan support," it read.
"We look forward to further support for the bill in the Legislative Council."


The Government has introduced legislation that would allow start-up Australian businesses to turn to crowdfunding to raise funds.

Crowd-sourced equity funding has so far been unregulated in Australia, stopping businesses from tapping a source of funds that could supercharge their growth.
Legislation to allow public companies, which are not ASX listed, to get involved will come into effect on September 29.
But a bill, introduced in the House of Representatives by the Treasurer Scott Morrison today, would extend the framework to cover the majority of Australian businesses that are proprietary companies.
"This will be a game-changer once again for Australian start-ups and new small businesses," Mr Morrison said.
If the changes pass Parliament, privately held companies will be able to raise up to $3 million from crowdfunding, before they become subject to a full audit.
Each investor would only be allowed to put in up to $10,000 to limit their exposure to risk.
Crowdfunding has become popular overseas with businesses, including Scottish craft beer company BrewDog, which raised more than $31 million in its latest crowdfunding campaign in the UK.
They recently convinced more than 9,000 Americans to pour in $8.7 million to fund its expansion in the United States.
To qualify for the equity crowdfunding schemes, proprietary business will need to have a minimum of two directors, make financial reports in accordance with accounting standards and abide by restrictions on related party transactions.
FinTech Australia has been working with the Government on the changes.
"It really is quite a big win for a number of the small to medium enterprises across Australia, not just the start-up community," said Danielle Szetho, FinTech Australia's CEO.
She expects larger businesses to use the model for specific projects, like launching a new store or expending overseas.
Labor has not yet decided if it will support the legislation, but said it welcomed moves to liberalise the equity crowdfunding framework.
In other changes that could help burgeoning tech businesses, the Government has moved to end the double taxation of digital currencies like Bitcoin — which would cut GST on the purchase of the currency.
However, the legislation changes have come too late for some Australian start-ups, including Tapview, which aims to facilitate small payments for online news and video.
Tapview's CEO James Jansson is launching a new product called Tapview TV, where YouTube stars could upload premium content and charge per view.
But getting to this point has been a struggle for the company.
"If you're a small company like us and you don't have a disclosure statement, you can't go out and advertise to the market," he said.
"You can't just put an ad up on Facebook and say 'hey, please invest in us', and that means that your sources of capital are quite limited."
Mr Jansson secured $100,000 funding from an accelerator program in 2016, but he wishes crowd sourced equity funding had been available.
"Companies like ours can make a lot of good things out of a very small amount of money," he said.
"So $3 million without having to go through a full audit… would improve our ability to serve our customers and survive through the very tough early stages of a start-up."


The Federal Government will be paid a substantially lower dividend from the Reserve Bank due to the value of its foreign assets being hurt by the resurgent Australian dollar over the past year.

In its annual report released this afternoon, the RBA said it would send a lighter $1.28 billion to Treasury in 2016/17 compared to $3.22 billion in the previous year.
Announcing an accounting loss of $897 million — down from $2.88 billion — RBA governor Philip Lowe blamed valuation losses on holdings of foreign assets caused by the appreciation of the Australian dollar.
Dr Lowe also pointed to the impact of low interest rates around the world and in Australia where the cash rate stands at an historic low of 1.5 per cent.
The annual report says underlying earnings at the RBA was $1 billion, with $300 million earned from capital gains.
In the annual report's forward, Dr Lowe reasserts the central bank's conservative approach to a still uncertain global economy.
"The Reserve Bank board is committed to having a strong balance sheet so that it can effectively perform its operations under a wide range of scenarios," Dr Lowe says.
"As the balance sheet has grown over recent times, there has been an increase in the share of the bank's assets that have relatively low market risk."
The annual report also reveals the Reserve Bank's spending on external consultancies was $987,388 in 2016/17 — up from $61,000 in 2009/10 at the height of the global financial crisis.

However, the report says about half of the spending was for an external review of the RBA's operations and to advise on the upgrade of Australian banknotes, with the new $5 note issued late last year.
The Reserve Bank will unveil a new $10 banknote next week.
The RBA says at the end of June there were 1.5 billion banknotes in circulation, worth $73.6 billion.
A new banknote distribution centre in Craigieburn in outer Melbourne was completed to deal with the growth of paper money in circulation, the report says.
But Dr Lowe notes the rise of the cashless society and the potential impact on traditional transactions.
"While cash is being used less in day-to-day transactions, the value of banknotes on issue relative to GDP [gross domestic product] is at its highest in more than five decades, reflecting its ongoing use as a store of value," Dr Lowe says in the report.
As governor, Dr Lowe is the highest paid of the Reserve Bank's 47 executives with a package of $930,662 comprising a base wage of $802,222 with $128,440 in employer superannuation.

The Federal Government's bill to change media ownership and regulation has passed the Senate 31 votes to 27.

The Government secured the support of the Nick Xenophon Team and One Nation to pass the bill.
It scraps restrictions such as the "two out of three" rule, which stops companies owning newspaper, radio and television stations in the same city.
The changes will also abolish the "reach rule", which prevented a single TV broadcaster from reaching more than 75 per cent of the population.
There will also be a change to revenue-based licence fees, which will be replaced by a lower spectrum charge.
Senator Xenophon secured an innovation package for regional and small publishers, worth $60.4 million over three years.
The fund will include money for 200 cadetships of as much as $40,000 each, as well as grants for small publishers that will be capped at $1 million.
"I see this as a down payment for the future of journalism in this country," Senator Xenophon said.
Communications Minister Mitch Fifield said the changes would help Australian media survive in the internet age.
"If you free up a little bit the media control laws that were drafted in the 1980s before the internet existed, you give the opportunity to the Australian media companies to configure themselves in ways to best support their viability," he said.
The Government had to rely on support from the crossbench because Labor did not support elements of the legislation.
As part of its agreement with the Coalition, One Nation wants an investigation into the ABC.
Speaking on RN Drive, Labor's Penny Wong accused Senator Xenophon of supporting an "attack" on the national broadcaster.
"Nick could've stopped an attack on the ABC with this legislation and he chose not to," she said.
"I think a lot of South Australians who voted for Nick, who are supporters of the ABC, will be very disappointed."
One Nation wanted the salaries of big-name ABC and SBS employees made public.
Senator Fifield said it was something he was investigating.
"We will be talking to the ABC about how they might do this and it could well require legislation but they are things we will be exploring," he said.
The media industry had been demanding the changes to reflect the changing media landscape.
In a statement, Seven West Media chairman Kerry Stokes said the changes would provide a "better future for local news and Australian stories".
"These historic changes will give Australian media companies a real opportunity to compete with unregulated global players," he said.
Seven West Media chief executive Tim Worner said the changes would allow "broadcasters and publishers to meet the increasing pace of change that we are facing".
Fairfax Media welcomed the changes, saying in a statement that it had "long supported the modernising of media laws to better reflect the current media environment".
It is widely expected the reforms will lead to mergers among large media companies, leading to some fears of reduced diversity of voices and a shrinking industry.
Free TV Chairman Harold Mitchell said while changes in the industry were likely, the diversity of voices will remain.
"It won't shrink the industry, that's not possible — the industry is alive and well," he said.
"I'd imagine a lot [of owners] are lining up now to say that it can be a little different, that might happen and come out of it — but it will go on."
Part of the Government's deal with crossbench Senator Xenophon was to launch an ACCC inquiry into the impact of the new digital environment on the media, particularly that of companies like Google and Facebook.
"I think it's absolutely necessary that we look at Google and Facebook, because in just 17 years digital advertising has gone from 0 per cent to about 40 per cent," Mr Mitchell said.
"There's the question of tax, where the information comes from, what they do in every way, and it should happen very quickly."


Tipped as the future of green motoring, hydrogen cars are virtually emissions-free and both simple and fast to refuel.
So what are they and how soon will we be driving them?
As their name suggests, they use hydrogen as a fuel to power the car.
Colourless, odourless hydrogen gas passes through a fuel stack, where it interacts with oxygen. This process both generates the electricity and creates water, which is the car's only emission and dribbles out from a little tube at the back.

Like electric cars, hydrogen cars using hybrid technology are quiet to drive. But the hydrogen models are quicker to refuel and have a longer range.
For example, the tank of Toyota's Mirai holds 5 kilograms of compressed hydrogen. The car's range has not been tested in Australia but in Europe it takes about three minutes to refuel a tank, which will last about 550 kilometres.
It's worth pointing out that hydrogen fuel cell technology is not new — NASA used them to power rockets for decades — but car manufacturers are now able to make fuel cells small and mobile enough to fit inside passenger cars.
They have the potential to be one of the cleanest cars on the road.
Their only emission is water, but the biggest hurdle to fulfilling their green potential is that the hydrogen to power the cars in Australia is now almost entirely sourced from fossil fuels, such as natural gas.

This could change if plans for a home-grown renewable hydrogen industry are successful.
It would ensure a source of hydrogen generated via renewable energy like wind or solar power.
It feels like driving a hybrid car, which is not surprising because they use similar technology.
You press a button to turn the car on and there's a barely audible hum as the motor starts.

There are only two obvious signs that it's a hydrogen car.
One is the H20 button, which prompts the purge of water from the system (this also happens automatically when the car is turned off), and the other is an interactive infographic on the dashboard which shows the chemical activity going on behind the scenes.
Your neighbour is unlikely to be pulling into their driveway in the latest hydrogen car anytime soon.
Firstly, you can't buy hydrogen cars in Australia yet. In fact, there are only four demonstration models in Australia — one owned by Hyundai and the remaining three by Toyota.
And secondly, even if you had one, you would have nowhere to refuel it.

As everyone in the industry acknowledges, the biggest impediments to widespread take-up of the cars are the sheer logistics and expense of building the refuelling infrastructure for everyday use.
For example, Toyota estimates it costs up to $2.3 million to build a medium-sized retail refuelling station in Europe or the US. The company has built itself a portable refueller, while Hyundai has one at its Sydney head office.
For these reasons, industry pundits agree it makes sense to promote hydrogen car use in densely populated areas of big cities.
Toyota's manager of advanced technology vehicles, Matthew Macleod, said there is a lot of interest from government and industry in using hydrogen to power trucks and buses which could use a common refuelling hub.
South Australia last week released its hydrogen road map, which outlines its intent to take the national lead in driving a hydrogen economy, including a $8.2m trial of a hydrogen bus fleet and refuelling station.
Western Australia trialled hydrogen buses last decade, but found it difficult to find an affordable and reliable source of hydrogen.



China's economy looks to pulling back into the slow lane after a range of data has shown a broad loss of momentum in domestic demand.

The key monthly readings on industrial production, infrastructure spending and retail sales in August were all weaker than the month before and below market expectations.
Industrial production showed a marked step-down with the output of key drivers such as electricity, steel and cement all slowing.
The manufacture of consumer items such as cars and mobile phones also fell.
Overall industrial production is now growing at its slowest pace since January, just before spending stimulus and easier credit conditions kicked in.
Softer export sales for industrial products didn't help, but Capital Economics Julian Evans Pritchard said the main culprit was weaker domestic demand.
Fixed asset investment (FAI) — a proxy for infrastructure and property spending — expanded at an annual rate of 8.3 per cent during the first eight months of a year.
But taking into account the spurt in FAI earlier in the year, Mr Evans-Pritchard says the data implies a slowdown from 6.8 per cent annual growth in July to less than 5 per cent last month.
There was a slight pick-up in manufacturing and property investment, but that was more than outweighed by a pull-back in spending on big infrastructure projects.

The pace of retail sales slowed noticeably as well, particularly in the automotive sector, along with sales of products linked to the property cycle including furniture, decorating materials and whitegoods.
Mr Evans-Pritchard said the upshot is that both foreign and domestic demand appear to be softening.
"In particular, infrastructure spending has now begun to cool as the front-loading of fiscal spending this year means that local governments are now having to pair back their outlays," he said.
"With tighter monetary conditions still weighing on credit growth, we expect a further slowdown in economic activity in coming quarters."

Clive Palmer has called himself as a witness in a Supreme Court battle with a liquidator trying to claw back money owed to sacked Queensland Nickel workers.
Government-appointed liquidators PPB Advisory is trying to freeze hundreds of millions of dollars of the former federal MP's assets,
Liquidators are concerned Mr Palmer's assets were being offloaded, given the recent sale of his Brisbane headquarters Mineralogy House, worth $23 million.
Queensland Nickel collapsed in 2016 with $300 million in debts, leaving more than 800 people out of work.
Mr Palmer is representing himself before Justice John Bond in the Supreme Court, but has hired barristers to represent his various companies.
When Justice Bond asked if anyone was calling Mr Palmer as a witness, Mr Palmer responded: "I am going to call myself."
He was cross-examined by barrister Shane Doyle QC, acting for the liquidators, over the events leading up to the collapse of the Townsville refinery, placed into voluntary administration in January last year.
Mr Palmer suggested he was "asleep" when administrators were appointed.
"Are you seriously suggesting … administrators were called in to QNI [Queensland Nickel], because of its insolvency, without your knowledge?" Mr Doyle said.
Mr Palmer replied: "The appointment of the administrators took place while I was asleep in bed, sleeping."
Mr Doyle then warned him about his evidence: "Be careful, Mr Palmer."
Mr Palmer said his nephew, Clive Mensink, and executive Daren Wolfe were at his house when he went to sleep.
"I went to bed around 9 o'clock and they continued through the night," Mr Palmer said.
Mr Doyle asked: "Did you know administrators were going to be appointed?"
Mr Palmer responded: "No."
Mr Doyle also accused Mr Palmer of giving untruthful evidence when he appeared to contradict what he had said in a sworn affidavit tendered to the court.
"You are not giving truthful evidence," Mr Doyle said.
"That's my recollection. It is what it is," Mr Palmer replied
Mr Palmer also cross-examined Campbell Jaski, a partner at PPB Advisory, who was the first witness to take the stand.
Mr Jaski valued the Queensland Nickel refinery for the liquidators.
The hearing is expected to run over two days.


Regional cinemas are struggling to keep the golden age of the movie experience alive, and they say Hollywood is to blame.
After an influx of films and patronage over the school holidays, the purse strings at local cinemas will again be tightened, with measures such as reduced screening sessions and closing through the middle of the day.
Independent Cinemas Australia president Scott Seddon said regional cinemas were not alone, with cinema attendance dropping internationally.
"We are all experiencing the same hit to the industry," he said.
"Recent figures have demonstrated that summer releases in America have gone pot. [Box office] was down by 6 per cent, which is a bit of a dive.
"Hollywood is learning that franchises can't be pushed out every 12 months. It's a learning curve as the market changes."
Andrew Mercado recently purchased the historic South West Roxy Cinema on the New South Wales north coast.
"It's problematic to schedule for teenagers. They are too caught up in devices so there is no guarantee. My priority is my retiree audience," he said.

Mr Mercado said Hollywood was largely to blame for falling cinema attendances.

"[Hollywood] have been relying too much on easy fixes like sequels and franchises. Originality is at an all-time low," he said.
"You can only do that for so long before the audience says 'That's enough'. It's just laziness.
"When we can do so much of this in our homes, Hollywood needs to catch up and give people value for money the moment they leave the house."
Mr Mercado said the recently released Dunkirk film, directed by Christopher Nolan, was a reminder cinemas would survive — it was made for the big screen and audiences flocked to see it.
Mr Seddon agreed, saying audiences responded positively to original content.
"That's one movie that really needs to be seen in the cinema," he said.
"Dunkirk was a really different approach to filmmaking, quite unique, and people really responded to that movie."
David McGowen, owner of the Plaza Theatre at Laurieton, south of Port Macquarie, hopes to remind audiences of the glory days of picture palaces.
"We have to keep it alive for the older generation who lived through it like I did, and they appreciate it," he said.

"I think of my cinema as an opportunity for people to come along on the ride with me."
With his cinema decorated with décor from cinemas around Queensland, Mr McGowen hopes to provide his audience with an alternative to streaming at home.
"I like to think people choose to come here as a total escape," he said.
However, Mr McGowen said technology and demand for constant entertainment was providing a new challenge for cinema owners.

"We move in different times now. Studios call films 'content' entertainment," he said.
"The magic of movies in the modern world has gone, and there's only a handful of us in Australia fighting to keep it alive."
ICA's Mr Seddon said passion is the key to keeping the cinema industry afloat.
"From the script to the cleaner, those who stick to the industry are the ones who are most passionate about it," he said.
"It's not an industry with huge financial gain, the people who are in the independent cinema industry are truly passionate."
Mr McGowen said Hollywood studios needed to take risks in productions in order to bring audiences back to the silver screen.
"We have Baz Luhrmann. He will bring back the glitz and glamour of the film industry," he said.
"But he is only one person. Most [producers] find those films too risky."
Mr McGowen said streaming and home entertainment would see the end of traditional picture houses.
"I think the bricks and mortar of cinemas will go. The current theatrical exhibition model is outdated due to the internet," he said.
However, with a passion for theatre and the cinematic experience, Mr McGowen has no intention letting the credits roll on his cinema story.
"The Plaza Theatre will be open as long as I am alive."

Donald Howard built Fay's Twin Cinema in Taree from the ground up in memory of his late wife.
Mr Howard has had a passion for film and cinematography since he was eight years old.
"I can remember rooting around in the garbage looking for snippets of film, and looking up at the light and wondering how is that magic done," he said.
"I would go to the cinema three or four times a week, collecting cordial bottles and cashing them in to buy a movie ticket."

He has worked in the industry ever since.
Fay's Twin Cinema opened with E.T., The Man from Snowy River, and Peter Pan in 1982.
Mr Howard said he had remained in the industry through multiple technology advancements, but the current cinema climate was a concern.
"In the last six weeks [as Dunkirk wound down], the movie business has taken a tumble. [The movie] IT is currently stacking people in, but I don't expect it to remain," he said.
"With Netflix and other things around, we are taking a dive."
Mr Howard said cinemas in regional Australia were most at risk of closure.
"To run cinemas you have to be dedicated. I expect to see a close of cinemas in the western cities of New South Wales. Coasts will survive thanks to tourism," he said.
However, he felt streaming was just the latest trend.
"I liken it to the time when we would press our faces into shop windows to look at TV sets, then colour TV in the 70s … that was just the new trend," he said.
"The truth of the matter with streaming, yes it allows us to sit at home, but it will return to cinema and the need for a big screen fix."



Imagine knowing a major Game of Thrones spoiler eight months before everyone else.
That was the reality for hundreds of staff at Australian visual effects firm Iloura, who were tasked with bringing to life a key battle scene in the latest season of the global phenomenon.
WARNING: IF YOU'RE NOT UP-TO-DATE ON GAME OF THRONES, THERE ARE SPOILERS AHEAD.
The epic scene in episode four, called The Loot Train, was brought to life by hundreds of staff over seven months.
They added fire, smoke, horses and people to hundreds of shots — though a different firm handled the dragons.

Visual effects (VFX) supervisor Glenn Melenhorst said it was time-consuming and sometimes tedious work.
"People who don't know our industry, they don't realise that a shot goes along a production line of different talents," he said.
"So there's people who only model objects in 3D and there's people who put texture and surfacing on them, or people who groom the hairs on the horses or people who build clothing and simulate clothing, and then there's people who actually animate and people who light.
"So one shot will come in and there'll be 20 or 30 steps before it's out the other side."

He said one of the toughest things to replicate was fire.
"Things like fire and water, any natural phenomena, take a lot of disc space to simulate and store but they also take a long time to calculate," Mr Melenhorst said.
"You don't just paint fire, you actually deal with fuel and vortices and heat and all those things.
"So they have to tweak all these settings and there can be thousands of these settings to get a certain type of fire and that can take two or three days sometimes."
Mr Melenhorst also said that given the show's trademark gore, his team had to do some gruesome research.
"A real hallmark of what we were doing was trying to show horses falling in ways that they wouldn't naturally, which felt more painful," he said.
"So you end up looking at a lot of YouTube clips of horrible accidents and steeple chase accidents and it's pretty grisly.
"We actually have to do some pretty grisly stuff in our job in order to study what's required for the nasty stuff. Wound research is never fun."
Last season the company was tasked with bringing to life the bloody Battle of the Bastards scene at the heart of the most expensive Game of Thrones episode ever.
Mr Melenhorst said it could be a burden to know key plot twists before anyone else.

"Knowing Jon Snow was alive eight months before anybody else did, you know, that's a burdensome thing to sort of carry with you," he said.
"But you know you have to and you can't tell anybody because you can't trust anybody not to have a lapse, so you just have to stay quiet on it."
All staff at Iloura had to sign hefty non-disclosure agreements and the company submits to regular security audits by the studios they work with.
VFX supervisor Josh Simmonds said it was an important part of being entrusted with such sensitive information.
"It's hugely controlled. A lot of our internet is completely locked down here," he said.
"And more often than not, we'll get given a script outline or a section of animation to give us an idea of what we're working with, but it's solely the section that we're working on so we don't necessarily understand the story arc."

Game of Thrones airs in 170 countries with a global audience of millions.
It has the enviable record for most Emmys ever won by a prime-time show and the unenviable title of the most pirated show ever.
Thanks to technology, the tyranny of distance hasn't held back the Australian visual effects firm.
Mr Simmonds said the show's directors do daily reviews of Iloura's progress, using programs to synchronise what both parties are watching on opposite sides of the world.
"We Skype with our clients daily but then there are people in LA who Skype with other people in LA because they can't be bothered with the traffic," he said.
Mr Melenhorst said working in the film and television industry no longer means moving to Hollywood.
"The film industry before the internet wasn't really viable in Melbourne, because data wasn't able to be transferred easily," he said.
"Since the advent of the internet and the ability to pipe information anywhere, it's made what was an essentially unachievable career achievable for us."


A decision to award a Tasmanian employee more than $8,000 after being sacked for calling in sick with a hangover sends a "confusing message" to employers, Launceston's Chamber of Commerce says.
A decision last week by the Fairwork Commission ruled Tassal employee Avril Chapman's sacking was valid but harsh and awarded her $8,229 in compensation.
Ms Chapman left the following message with her employer on April 25 this year:
"Hi Michelle, it's Avril one of your most loved pains in the arse.
"Um, its ANZAC day, my birthday, and I admit I have over-indulged so I'm taking into account one of the golden rules be fit for work and I'm not going to be fit for work so I won't be there. But um love ya, catch ya on the flip side."
In its decision, the commission said the conduct of the employee was not in dispute and the reason for dismissing Ms Chapman was valid.
However, she was awarded $8,229 compensation because the termination was considered to be harsh.
Ms Chapman, who was employed in a Tassal fish factory for five years, was accused by the company of  "using a golden safety rule to excuse or justify her behaviour in consuming alcohol to an extent that she anticipated she would be unable to work the next day."
Ms Chapman said it was fatigue which led to the phone call because she felt she was not able to fulfil her role at work safely.
The commission found there was a valid reason for dismissal, saying she "placed herself voluntarily in a position where she was unable to work by reason of the consumption of alcohol."
"This was in circumstances where she could have gone to bed early to sleep and put herself in a position to work," the commission found.
The commission said her conduct led to her own downfall but the company had "misused a prior warning as a reason to proceed to termination rather than a less severe sanction."

The Launceston Chamber of Commerce's Chief Executive Officer Neil Grose said the decision was confusing for employers.
"There's certainly a lot of mixed messages coming from the Fair Work Commission with a decision like this," he said.
"On one hand the commission says that the company acted properly in dismissing the employee, but on the other hand awards over $8,000 because they saw the decision as being harsh."
Mr Grose said awarding compensation was inappropriate if an employer has acted appropriately.
"Our understanding is that there had been a history of this sort of behaviour, that the employee in question had been counselled before and had received a warning before," he said.
"Either the dismissal is unfair or it's not, and clearly it wasn't unfair because the commission agreed that she should've been dismissed, but then to award such a large payment on top of that is something the chamber finds very inappropriate."


Up to 100 flights in and out of Sydney Airport are cancelled and dozens more are delayed as wind gusts hit the runways.

The airport and airlines have not stated how long it will take to clear the backlog, but passengers at the airport told the ABC that airlines had said it might take days for them to get another flight.
Only one of three runways was operating at Australia's busiest airport due to gusts of nearly 60 kilometres per hour.
The winds are only affecting domestic flights. International flights are running as usual.

Air Services Australia warned there will be more flight cancellations later on Thursday due to the strong cross winds.
"A single runway is operating due to strong, gustily crosswinds and that's forecast to last until [the airport's] curfew tonight at 11:00pm," a spokeswoman said.
Rosemary Barr from the Bureau of Meteorology said the winds would continue into the evening.
"We do tend to see variability in wind speed so they may abate and develop but we do expect the general strength of the wind to maintain for the next few hours into the evening," he said.
Sarah Fulton from Air Services Australia said passengers should check their flight status with airlines before going to the airport.
"At this stage there is a slight improvement on conditions [tomorrow], but we will work with airlines to help passengers get to where they need to get to," she said.
Qantas, Virgin, Jetstar, Tiger and REX were scrambling to reschedule passengers in and out of Sydney.
John and Margaret Morris were heading to Adelaide to catch a paddle steamer to celebrate their 50th wedding anniversary when their flight to Adelaide was cancelled.

The pair, from the Hunter region, said they had called up the airline yesterday to confirm their flights but had no such courtesy in return.
"Nobody let us know by phone or anything that it has been cancelled," Mr Morris said.
The octogenarians were in good spirits and hopeful their rebooked flight, scheduled for after 8:00pm, would be able to depart.
"You've just got to roll with the punches," Mr Morris said.
Wollongong family Kim, Anabelle and Mia Fingland, were going to be heading to Queensland for a surf competition before their flights were cancelled.
The youngest, Mia, seemed more excited about their alternative travel arrangements.
"We're going to stay in a hotel in Bondi," she said.
Several sporting teams traveling on flights to and from the Harbour City for finals clashes, including NRL outfit Penrith and AFL teams West Coast and Sydney Swans, were not affected by the delays.


Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has again told the NT Chief Minister to "pull the trigger" on gas mining in an effort to persuade him to lift the current ban on fracking.
Last night, Mr Turnbull used a speech at an expo promoting Northern Australia in Canberra to reiterate a position he made clear during a recent visit to Darwin.
NT Chief Minister Michael Gunner was among business and political representatives from Northern Australia who were in the audience when the Prime Minister delivered his speech.
"There's a lot of gas in the North, Michael," he said.
"Pull the trigger, Gunner. Pull the trigger.
"We need that gas down here ... there is not enough supply and we need more of that gas."
The NT Labor Government put a 12-month moratorium on fracking in September 2016 and will decide whether to lift the ban when the findings of a fracking inquiry are delivered.
Mr Gunner and Minister for Indigenous Affairs, Nigel Scullion, spoke before the Prime Minister, and used the platform to talk about partnering with the Commonwealth and the potential in the North.
"Half of the nation's exports come from the north of Australia and we have 5 per cent of the population," Mr Gunner said.
"Imagine what we could do with more people.

"We are rich in culture, we are rich in land and we are rich in potential and we the NT want to work with you here in Canberra and those across the country to embrace all that we have and all that we can be."
In his speech, Mr Turnbull said he hoped Mr Gunner decided to allow mining in the vast and untapped gas fields that gas companies have said exist in the NT.
"I hope he is moving sedately but purposely and irreversibly towards opening up that big shoal gas province in the Northern Territory," Mr Turnbull said.
He said lifting the ban would bring benefits to southern, eastern and northern markets.
"There is a lot of good news associated with shale gas and having more of that available in the Territory and across Australia will be enormously important," he said.
"While obviously a lot of that will come south and to the east coast and southern markets, there is the opportunity to do a lot with it in the Northern Territory as well.
"Affordable gas has been a driver of jobs. It has been a driver of manufacturing. It actually is a driver of lower emissions too."
It is not the first time the Northern Territory's energy policy has been criticised by the Prime Minister.
In a speech at the Country Liberals annual conference in Darwin on Saturday, Mr Turnbull said the Northern Territory was at risk of squandering its "immense" resource opportunities.
"My message to Michael Gunner is: pull the trigger, get on with it," Mr Turnbull said in that speech.
"The jobs, the investment, the opportunities that come with opening up 180 years of gas that you're sitting on is endless."
Like other leaders, Opposition Leader Bill Shorten did not chime into the gas debate, but instead gave advice on the need to develop air, road and tourism infrastructure in the Northern Territory.
"You don't need lectures from fly-in, fly-out politicians on day trips to the Territory, what you want is long-term commitment," he said.
"We get that the Territory has got a future but we also understand that the Territory is not looking for a handout, what it says is that it just wants its fair share of faith and passion for the Territory."


Australia's unemployment rate has held steady at 5.6 per cent in August, due to the creation of more than 54,000 jobs, most of them full-time.

The Bureau of Statistics estimated that 40,100 full-time positions were added to the economy last month, with a further 14,100 part-time jobs also created, seasonally adjusted.
The level of job creation was more than three times higher than what was expected by most economists, pushing the Australian dollar back above 80 US cents upon its 11:30am (AEST) release.
"Employment growth has been phenomenal and there has been a gradual tightening in the labour market," noted Commonwealth Bank economist Gareth Aird.
The reason the strong job creation did not lower the jobless rate from 5.6 per cent is that the ABS survey also recorded an increase in the proportion of people aged over 15 in work or looking for it — the participation rate — to 65.3 per cent.
That is the highest participation rate in almost five years.
The federal Employment Minister Michaela Cash said a lot of the increase was due to a record number of women entering the workforce.
"As the Minister for Women, I am delighted the female participation rate has hit an all-time high of 60 per cent," she told reporters.
"There are now more females participating in the workforce than at any other time in Australia's history, in excess of 3 million."

Despite the increase in full-time work and the participation rate, the ABS only recorded a 0.4 per cent increase in total hours worked last month.
The Bureau of Statistics prefers to look at the more stable trend figures and, on that basis, its chief economist Bruce Hockman noted in the report that the August numbers continue a recent move towards stronger growth in full-time employment.
"Full-time employment has now increased by around 253,000 persons since August 2016, and makes up the majority of the 307,000 person increase in employment over the period," he wrote.
The employment-to-population ratio has also risen to a four-and-a-half-year high, as job creation exceeded population growth.
On a seasonally-adjusted basis, the quarterly underemployment rate has eased from a record high of 8.9 per cent in February to 8.6 per cent in August.
However, Mr Hockman said underemployment — which is where workers want and are available for more hours of work — is still at a record high level in trend terms.
"The underemployment rate is an important indicator of the spare capacity of workers in Australia, and it has remained at 8.7 per cent, a historical high, for the third consecutive quarter," he noted.

Underemployment is much more common amongst female workers, where the trend level is 10.8 per cent, versus 6.9 per cent for men.
Economists are concerned about the persistently high underemployment rate — which is around a percentage point above global financial crisis levels — because the pool of workers who want more hours continue to put downward pressure on wage growth, which is at its lowest level since the last recession.

Paul Dales from Capital Economics said the underutilisation rate — which combines the unemployment and underemployment rates — fell from 14.4 per cent in May to 14.1 per cent in August.
"But it needs to fall to around 12 per cent before we can say that there is a 'normal' amount of spare capacity in the labour market," he wrote in a note.
"As such, while faster employment growth will put more money in households' pockets, it probably won't translate into much faster wage growth."
CBA's Gareth Aird agrees, but said several more months of data like these could turn the economic and interest rate outlook on its head.
"Despite the solid jobs growth, we think that we are still some way from labour market slack being eroded sufficiently to put genuine upward pressure on wages. As such, we have the RBA on hold until late 2018," he wrote.
"However, with each robust monthly employment report the risk of a rate hike before late 2018 inches higher."


Department store Myer has delivered a threadbare full-year profit of just $11.9 million as top-line sales slipped and the company was forced to take a knife to a number of investments.

The result was 80 per cent down on last year's profit, while underlying earnings — excluding one off gains and losses — of $67.9 million dropped 2 per cent and fell short of analyst expectations.
Sales revenue fell 1.4 per cent to $3.2 billion, however it was a number of impairment charges that really ravaged the bottom line.
The recently acquired sass & bide fashion range again recorded disappointing sales and its book value was written down by $39 million.
Myer has also written off the entire value of its $6.8 million investment in Australia, which operated the Topshop chain and was put into administration in May.
Myer chief executive Richard Umbers said it was disappointing to have hit the target of beating last year's underlying earnings and that progress against key measures was slower than anticipated.
However he said a number of initiatives — such as store closures and investments in online sales — had made Myer leaner and a more efficient retailer.
"We have made significant progress to deliver New Myer, which as assisted the company to withstand the challenging retail trading conditions characterised by heightened competition, subdues consumer sentiment and discount fatigue," he said.
Department stores have been the most brutalised sector within retail by tumbling consumer sentiment with ABS figures showing sales having fallen in 11 of the past 13 months.
While talking up "New Myer", Mr Umbers revealed to The Business that the retailer was holding a strategy day on November 1 to review its turnaround strategy.
"The reason we're doing that is because, since the strategy launched, there have been many changes in the marketplace," he said.
"The consumer environment has changed, the market has changed and the competitive environment has changed also.
"We still believe that the strategy is the right one, but what we also talked about today is the changing emphasis of the business to respond to that changing marketplace."
Mr Umbers said Myer will "double down" on its "omnichannel" efforts to integrate online and in-store shopping, and also focus on fresh ways to get more people to come in store through expanded "experiential retailing".
Myer has accelerated its downsizing announcing it would not be renewing leases at Hornsby, Belconnen in the ACT and the Colonnades centre in Adelaide on top this year's closure of three stores at Orange, Brookside and Wollongong.
In addition it has handed back floorspace to landlords in another four stores.
That brings the total loss of space in the past two years to almost 7.5 hectares — or the equivalent of four MCGs.

However Myer appears to be gaining traction in its online sales, which grew by more than 40 per cent and now represent 8 per cent of all sales.
Mr Umbers noted the first six weeks of the 2018 financial year have also been below expectation, but the company was well placed to pick up in the significant spring racing and Christmas trading periods.

"[The] consensus for underlying net profit after tax in 2018 of $66 million already factors in a subdued start to the year," Mr Umber said.
It also signals the market expects another year of lower profitability.
Myer will pay a full-year dividend of 5 cents a share, the same as last year but slightly lower than expected.
Investors were relieved that things were not worse and at 11:30am (AEST) share were up almost 3 per cent to 74 cents.


Former pharmaceuticals company CEO Martin Shkreli has had his bail revoked over a threat made against Hillary Clinton and will sit behind bars ahead of sentencing for securities fraud.

In a Facebook post last week Shkreli encouraged people to grab samples of Hillary Clinton's hair and said he would pay them $US5,000 ($6,262) per sample.
"The Clinton Foundation is willing to KILL to protect its secrets. So on HRC's book tour, try to a grab a hair from her. I must confirm the sequences I have," Shkreli said in the since deleted post.
A judge heard arguments about whether the controversial online antics of Shkreli, dubbed the Pharma Bro, were bad enough to put him behind bars and decided to have him taken into custody immediately.
Prosecutors said the posting prompted the Secret Service to use more resources because it ran the risk many of Shkreli's social media followers would think he was serious and that he should await sentencing behind bars.
A defence attorney argued in court papers that Shkreli's offer was merely a tasteless joke comparable to some of US President Donald Trump's derisive comments, not a threat worthy of putting him behind bars.
"Indeed, in the current political climate, dissent has unfortunately often taken the form of political satire, hyperbole, parody or sarcasm," wrote the lawyer, Ben Brafman.
"There is a difference, however, between comments that are intended to threaten or harass and comments — albeit offensive ones — that are intended as political satire or strained humour."
The Clinton offer could be viewed as "a solicitation of an assault", judge Kiyo Matsumoto said before revoking Shkreli's $US5 million bail.
"This is not protected by the First Amendment," she said.
"There's a risk that somebody may take him up on it."
The Government had told the judge the message had alarmed the Secret Service detail that protects Mrs Clinton, a Democratic former presidential candidate and first lady.

It also argued that it fit a pattern of veiled threats against female journalists who rebuffed Shkreli's social media advances and of taunts aimed at prosecutors in his case.
Shkreli on Monday wrote to the court apologising for his behaviour, saying: "I am not a violent person."
But for Ms Matsumoto it was too little, too late.
"He should apologise to the Government, the Secret Service and Hillary Clinton," she said
Shkreli watched in silence as the hearing unfolded and sometimes put his head down and appeared to scribble notes.
After the judge's ruling, he remained expressionless as deputy US marshals led him out a side door of the courtroom without handcuffing him.
Shkreli, who is best known for hiking up the price of a life-saving drug and for trolling his critics on social media, was found guilty last month on charges, unrelated to the price-fixing scandal, that he cheated investors in two failed hedge funds he ran.
The defence had argued investors got their original investments back and even made hefty profits.
Shkreli has said he felt "exonerated" despite his conviction and thought there was a "50-50 chance" he would not face any punishment. He chatted with fans on his YouTube channel and sparred with a reporter after last month's verdict.
"In sum and substance," he said, "I feel exonerated."

The Australian share market is set to open flat, ahead of the August job figures.

The local bourse may follow a positive lead from Wall Street, which edged marginally higher to close at fresh records for a second straight day.
Sell-offs in most stock sectors drove the S&P 500 and Nasdaq into negative territory for much of the trading day.
But the two major indexes managed to post minor gains in the final ten minutes of trade — enough to carve out record closes.
Since Apple's launch of its new iPhones on Wednesday, the company's share price has dropped 0.75 per cent to $US159.65, which weighed on the technology sector.
Despite most US sectors being sold off, energy stocks rose following a rebound in oil prices.
Brent crude surged by 1.5 per cent to a five-week high after the International Energy Agency (IEA) reported on Wednesday that the global oil surplus is beginning to shrink.
This was due to stronger-than-expected European and US demand growth and production declines (for the first time in four months) from OPEC and non-OPEC countries, according to the IEA.
The IEA said global oil output fell by 0.72 million barrels per day in August. The reason for that was unplanned outages and scheduled maintenance in OPEC member Libya, and non-OPEC countries including Russia, Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan.
Another reason for the bullish trading is that the "Trump trade" seems to be back — particularly after comments made by US Treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin on Tuesday.
Mr Mnuchin said he was "incredibly hopeful" that a "competitive" tax rate for businesses would be introduced by the end of this year.
Since President Donald Trump took office investors have been hoping his much-touted corporate tax cuts would become law.
However, their optimism had waned in recent months due to the Trump administration's inability to overcome party infighting, and its repeated failure to repeal Obamacare.
The ASX SPI futures were up by just 1 point. Coupled with Wall Street's fairly flat close, this suggests a subdued open for Australian shares.
The big item on today's economic agenda is the August labour force report from the Bureau of Statistics.
Ecomists polled by  are expecting the unemployment rate to remain steady at 5.6 per cent with 15,000 new jobs to be created (which is not as high as July's figure of 27,900).
But that forecast differs depending on who you ask.
Deutsche Bank and NAB economists are expecting 20,000 new jobs and a steady unemployment rate.
The August employment data will also contain figures on underemployment, which has been stuck near record highs this year.
Australia's major trading partner, China, will also release its August figures for fixed asset investment, retail sales and industrial production.
"We think the data will likely simply confirm the picture of mildly slowing growth," said NAB currency strategist Rodrigo Catril.
Retail giant Myer will release its full-year results this morning.
The market expectation is for Myer to post an underlying profit of around $70 million, weighed down by substantial write-downs on certain fashion labels.


The wife of the bankrupt founder of the Nant whisky and angus cattle investment schemes will be interviewed by the corporate watchdog as part of an ongoing investigation into the saga, the ABC's Background Briefing has learned.

Margaret Batt, who replaced her husband Keith Batt as a director of various Nant businesses before he declared himself bankrupt in late 2015, was told on Tuesday that she would have to answer questions from the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) in Brisbane.
It is understood that ASIC, which declined to comment, is trying to establish whether any alleged offences raised in complaints from angry investors potentially amount to breaches of the Corporations Act.
Almost 900 investors purchased barrels of whisky from Nant after commercial production began at a distillery in Bothwell, north of Hobart, in 2008.
The barrels, which cost up to $14,000 each, were stored on site in a bonded warehouse until the whisky contained within them reached maturity — a process that was expected to take four years.
In an era of low interest rates, Nant promised to then buy the barrels back from investors and reward them with a generous return of 9.55 per cent each year.
The angus cattle scheme was based on a very similar model. Investors paid $30,000 for a herd of 10 black breeding cows and were told they would receive the same return when they sold them back to Nant five years later.
But both schemes have been beset with problems. Hundreds of investors, numerous suppliers, the Australian Tax Office, and even a famous former Australian cricketer together lost millions of dollars.

"On the face of it, you couldn't think of a more diverse set of investments," said financial advisor and commentator Scott Pape, better known as The Barefoot Investor.
"You've got whisky, you've got farmland, you've got cows — come to think of it, I've pretty much described my old man's dream retirement but it was a nightmare for anyone that invested in this."
The first sign of trouble came in December, 2015, when the founder of the Nant businesses, Keith Batt, declared himself bankrupt, owing more than $16 million after a series of failed property ventures in Brisbane. He had earlier removed himself as a director of the Nant operation.
Then, in March this year, an audit of the whisky barrels stored on the Nant estate in Bothwell found more than 700 were apparently never filled, some were missing, and others had been secretly decanted, bottled, and sold to the public.
The audit was carried out by the publicly listed Australian Whisky Holdings, which initiated a takeover of Nant last October before subsequently abandoning the idea.
The company instead purchased only the Nant name and the distilling assets. It is continuing to produce whisky on the Bothwell estate.

Amidst all this worrying news, cattle investors like Raja Barua from Melbourne had no idea what had happened to their cows.
The 48-year-old said police from the Stock and Rural Crime Investigation Squad in Longreach in Queensland's central-west recently told him they had managed to locate some of the animals.
But officers have so far been unable to confirm whether any of them belong to him. That's despite Nant promising to tag the cows and assign to each of them a unique identification number.
"I'm just presuming and hoping that my 10 cattle are among those that have been found," Mr Barua said.
According to brochures promoting the investment scheme, Nant was keeping the cattle on a property in Augathella.
But Background Briefing understands they are now on a different property in Inglewood in the state's southern inland.
In June, the Brisbane Magistrates Court issued Mr Batt with an $800 fine for failing to update the National Livestock Identification System.
Queensland's Office of Fair Trading is conducting its own investigation into the Angus cattle scheme at the request of the state attorney-general Yvette D'ath.
Meanwhile, as revealed by Background Briefing in August, the fraud squad at Tasmania Police has launched a criminal investigation into the whisky barrel investment scheme.



Australia's media industry looks set for a major shake-up, after the Federal Government finally struck a deal to pass a suite of changes.

The Coalition has been negotiating with the Senate crossbench over the proposal for weeks, and has now managed to hammer out a final agreement.
Under the changes the two-out-of-three rule will be scrapped, allowing a company to own a TV station, newspaper and radio station in a single market.
The "reach rule", which prevented a single TV broadcaster from reaching more than 75 per cent of the population, will also go.
There will also be a change to revenue-based licence fees, which will be replaced by a lower spectrum charge.
Key to the passage of the legislation has been the support of senator Nick Xenophon and his team.
Senator Xenophon said the negotiations were "the most difficult and protracted" he had ever been involved in, but key to his support was a fund for regional journalism.
"I and my colleagues welcome the Government's commitment to implement a regional and small publishers jobs and innovation package worth $60.4 million over three years," he said.
The fund will include money for 200 cadetships of as much as $40,000 each, as well as grants for small publishers that will be capped at $1 million.


Larger media companies like Newscorp and Fairfax will be ineligible to access the fund.
Senator Xenophon said he had also secured a deal for an ACCC inquiry into the impact of platforms like Google and Facebook on the media industry.
Debate went late into last night, and there could be a final vote by the end of the week.
Communications Minister Mitch Fifield said the reforms were essential.
"We have the support of essentially the entire Australian media industry," he said.
It has been a protracted negotiation process as Labor was opposed to elements of the legislation.
The Coalition had to strike a deal with Pauline Hanson's One Nation party, which wants an investigation into the ABC.
Senator Fifield said the national broadcaster will be subject to a "competitive neutrality inquiry".
"Whether a government organisation is using its status in a way to compete in a way that isn't reasonable with commercial organisations," he said.

The Minister rejected suggestions that One Nation was attacking the ABC.
"What we have agreed and what we will seek to pursue in relation to the ABC are measures to enhance the ABC," Senator Fifield said.
The measures that relate to the public broadcaster will be dealt with in a separate piece of legislation.
There will also be a requirement for the ABC to have a reference to "rural and regional" in its charter as well as two people on the ABC board with a rural or regional background.


Carina Gabb felt trapped. In 2014, she paid $21,000 to join a timeshare scheme she thought would guarantee cheap international holidays for the rest of her life.

But three years since she signed on the dotted line with timeshare giant Classic Holidays, she had not gone on a single trip.
"We were ripped off," she told 7.30.
"They've taken our money, they've not provided us what they've promised us. They mislead us."
Ms Gabb is among a growing number of consumers who say timeshare operators are behaving unethically, and are offering a products that simply are not value for money.
She says she was told during a Classic Holidays sales seminar that after paying her joining fee, she would be able to book a four-week holiday to the United States for less than $4,000.
But she says when she received her membership details and logged on to book the trip on the Classic Holidays system, she was quoted $8,000.
"My heart sank. I felt betrayed," she said.
After a flood of complaints, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) is now considering introducing tougher rules to protect Australia's 175,000 timeshare members.
The regulator is conducting a review of the sector, and has asked consumer groups and the industry for input on what changes are needed.
"We've received complaints about people being lured in to [timeshare] seminars really under false pretences," Katherine Temple from the Consumer Action Law Centre said.
"What people find once they arrive at these seminars is that they're subject to very high-pressure sales tactics and they feel a lot of pressure to sign up to what is essentially a very poor value product.
"And, really, those practices are disgraceful and we would like to see them stopped."

The Australian Timeshare and Holiday Ownership Council (ATHOC) is contributing the review, but it has warned ASIC against making drastic changes.
"We do hope ... that full and complete consideration has been given to the effect any changes may have on existing timeshare owners and the future growth of the industry which currently contributes more than $692.5M annually directly into the Australian economy," ATHOC's general manager Laura Younger said in a statement.
The timeshare industry has evolved significantly since the early holiday ownership schemes started to emerge in Australian in the 1970s.
Under early schemes, members would pay for access to a particular property for a number of weeks each year.
Australia's biggest timeshare providers, which include Classic Holidays, Accor Vacation Club, Ulitiqa and Wyndham Vacaton Resorts, now offer points-based schemes.
Under most schemes, members pay a joining fee in return for an annual allocation of points — which can be used to purchase accommodation in Australia and overseas.
For higher-end trips, members have to pay to buy extra points.
Consumer group Choice argues that points-based programs "hide the poor value of schemes".
It says many consumers would be better off booking holidays themselves.
"Points schemes appear to be deliberately complex," Choice said in its submission to ASIC's review.
However, Ms Younger said there was no sign that members were unhappy with points-based schemes.
"There are more than 81,000 owners participating in points-based clubs within Australia who regularly use their points for holidays which is testament to the popularity of this product," she said.
"Owners in points-based clubs have increased flexibility and can use their points for both accommodation as well as cruises, car hire, airfares or other holiday related purposes."
Ms Gabb has tried repeatedly to cancel her Classic Holidays membership, but there is no exit clause in her contract.
The contract requires her to pay an annual membership fee for 80 years — until she is 110 years old.
However, after being contacted by 7.30, Classic Holidays said it had cancelled her membership because of unpaid annual fees.
Ms Gabb said she had not received any notification that her membership was cancelled.
Classic Holildays denied Ms Gabb was misled at its sales seminar, saying that the price quoted for the US trip was not all-inclusive.


Whistleblowers should be financially rewarded for speaking up about misconduct, fraud or corruption across both public and private sectors, a parliamentary inquiry recommends.

Current and former staff who put their jobs on the line by speaking up should also be guarded by the establishment of a Whistleblower Protection Authority, according to a joint committee report into whistleblower protections released late on Wednesday.
The new authority would support whistleblowers, assess whistleblowing allegations and conduct investigations into reprisals against staff.
It would also have the powers of an investigative agency with powers to undertake criminal investigations and to refer cases to the Australian Federal Police.
Other recommendations include extending current whistleblower legislation to the private sector and broadening the definition of whistleblowing to current and former staff who make a disclosure and those suspected of making a disclosure.
Financial rewards for whistleblowers would be a proportion of any penalty imposed against an employer or as a result of an investigation initiated by whistleblowing, the inquiry recommends.
The level of reward would be determined by a court taking into account the degree to which the whistleblower's information led to penalties being imposed and whether there was an appropriate and accessible whistleblower procedure within a company or government agency.
The sweeping recommendations come after a range of scandals within corporate Australia where whistleblowers who disclosed misconduct, fraud or corruption were sometimes sacked, demoted or persecuted by employers.
The committee report said evidence to the inquiry shows "whistleblower protections remain largely theoretical with little practical effect in either the public or private sectors".
The report points to the "near impossibility" of current laws to protect whistleblowers from reprisals and to hold those responsible for reprisals being called to account.

To track the effectiveness of proposed new legislation, the committee wants annual reports made to parliament from both public and private sectors as well as not-for-profit organisations.
Another recommendation is that the Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman conduct an inquiry into protections for whistleblowers against reprisals.
Former public officials as well as former contractors to the Australian Public Service would also be able to make disclosures under a recommendation that the Public Interest Disclosure Act of 2013 be amended.
The report says that where a whistleblower discloses information to a law enforcement agency, he or she must receive regular updates on whether or not the matter is being pursued.
The inquiry considered 75 submissions including ones from the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, Transparency International Australia, trade unions, business groups and whistleblowers such as Jeff Morris, whose career at the Commonwealth Bank imploded after he disclosed allegedly inappropriate behaviour.

Adelaide rail commuters are set to endure more months of frustration and delays because of works affecting three city train lines.
The State Government said the Outer Harbor and Grange lines, and about a third of the Gawler line, will be out of action for up to 10 weeks because of the Torrens Rail Junction project.
From September 24 until December 3, Outer Harbor and Grange passengers will be forced to use substitute buses.
On the Gawler line, substitute buses will operate between the city and Mawson Lakes from October 1 until October 16.
The closures are to allow for the removal of three level crossings in Bowden — on Park Terrace, and on Gibson and East streets.

The State Government said the closures would also allow for excavation to begin on the new rail underpass and an upgrade to Croydon railway station.
"While it is disappointing that we need to disrupt train services to do these works, when they are complete they will have a big impact in reducing delays for both road traffic and rail services," Transport Minister Stephen Mullighan said in a statement.
The work is part of a $238 million upgrade to separate freight and passenger rail lines, and will see the freight line lowered beneath the Outer Harbor line in Adelaide's parklands.
"Once these works are complete, Outer Harbor and Grange trains will no longer need to slow down at these level crossings and the requirement for trains to give way to one another will also be removed, improving the travel times for all services," Mr Mullighan said.
Adelaide's suburban train lines have been closed for extended periods in recent years to allow for upgrades including electrification and track works, and because of problems such as electrical faults.


A Labor frontbencher is demanding the resignation of Employment Minister Michaelia Cash after it was revealed she knew the head of the building watchdog breached the Fair Work Act almost a year ago.

Australian Building and Construction Commission boss Nigel Hadgkiss resigned today after admitting to breaching the act over right to entry rules.
In court it was revealed Mr Hadgkiss knew about material distributed by his organisation that suggested employers could make reasonable requests to stop union officials holding meetings in workplaces.
But under changes to the laws, the employer no longer had that right and unions could meet workers in meal rooms for talks if needed.
Unions reacted with fury to the admission.
And when pressed in Question Time, the Employment Minister revealed she had known about the matter for some time.
"I became aware of the behaviour in October 2016," Senator Cash said.
Labor senator Doug Cameron was furious.
"Not only should Mr Hadgkiss have resigned today, but the Minister should resign as well, she is responsible for him," he said.
"She should take responsibility for appointing someone who breached the law he was supposed to make sure was complied with."

Australian Council of Trade Unions president Ged Kearney was equally unimpressed.
"He was prepared to put up misinformation, it appears he wanted fact sheets to reflect laws he wanted to be in place rather than what was actually there," he said.
"It just makes a complete mockery of this Government's agenda to break down unions and to stop working people get justice at work."
Liberal senator and former employment minister Eric Abetz accused the union of seizing on a "slip-up" to distract from their own problems.
"That which Mr Hadgkiss is alleged to have done pales into absolute insignificance, it is literally in the parable, they are pointing out a little speck in Mr Hadgkiss's eye," he said.
Mr Hadgkiss has had a long career, heading up the Building Industry Taskforce, the office of the DPP in New South Wales, and the Construction Code Compliance Office in Victoria.
Senator Cash's office issued a statement to the ABC, but did not respond to specific questions about Mr Hadgkiss's actions.
"Minister Cash was first advised of the CFMEU's allegations against Mr Hadgkiss in October 2016," a spokesman said.
"Yesterday Mr Hadgkiss admitted to a contravention of the Fair Work Act. He has today submitted his resignation to the Government which the Government has accepted."


South Australia is home to some of the oldest vines in the world, which comes with a longstanding problem.
Grape growers have faced an ongoing issue when disposing of wooden posts which support the vines to grow.
Typical pine posts are treated with arsenic, so growers are forbidden to throw away, burn or bury them.
Jack Papageorgiou has been growing grapes in the Riverland for more than forty years.
He said it was a problem every grape grower in Australia faced and it was only getting worse.
"Posts do break during harvest and in other weather conditions," he said.
"The biggest problem we have is... how are we going to dispose of all these broken posts?"
Mr Papageorgiou has to replace at least 1,000 of his posts each year.
But one South Australian company believes it has a solution for the thousands of grape growers lumped with the problem.
Conma Industries — which used to supply to the automotive industry — has developed an environmentally-friendly metal post for grape growers to use instead of traditional wooden posts.
The company, which is based at Edwardstown in Adelaide's south, has received a $328,000 grant from the State Government to assist in its transition.
Agriculture Minister Leon Bignell said it costs the wine industry around $107 million a year to replace broken wooden posts, and believes producing metal posts could solve the problem while creating jobs.
"We have people in the wine industry with great ideas," he said.
"It's terrific to see them coming together rather than going offshore."
Conma Industries is already selling to 137 vineyards locally and also overseas.
Automotive Transformation Minister Kyam Maher said the demand for metal posts continued to grow.
"The manufacturing has doubled pretty much each year for the last three years," he said.
"It is a great story about how the company is doing something different and keeping on going after the closure of Holden."
Mr Papageorgiou, who has not used metal posts in the past, is keen on trying them out.
"We need that sort of investment," he said.
"I am willing to listen and to be able to use the product and be able to do a bit of a trial on my vineyards. Bring it on."


Tens of thousands of Papua New Guineans have been without electricity for the past two days because of an electronic payment system glitch.

PNG Power's pre-paid Easipay system failed on September 11, leaving customers unable to top-up their accounts.
The company promised to have the system restored by midnight on the September 12, but failed to do so.
Those customers with limited credit spent the time without power to their homes.
Yolandrea English said the outage spoiled the food in her family's freezer.
"Our cleaner here is trying to throw out all our meat, because [the electricity has] been out like that for two days now," she said.
The pre-paid power is usually purchased on mobile phones or from shops.
Ms English and her one-year-old daughter Rubie spent the time outside on their verandah trying to keep cool, as their fans and air-conditioning system could not be used.
"I can't cope up with the fact that PNG Power doesn't have a back up system in play," she said.
"Its just unrealistic."

Ms English's brother Patrick was angry that PNG Power, which is a government-owned utility, could not fix the problem.
"Services from the Government is very poor, they need to step up, pull their socks up, do something about it," he said.
"We actually pay tax, I am very frustrated and pissed off that we update our tax and they don't do their jobs."
In a statement released today, PNG Power said the system had been fixed, but that customers would need to buy vouchers from its offices.
It promised to progressively restore the other parts of the service.


Some of Australia's top restaurateurs are warning their businesses are being put at risk due to an extreme skills shortage in hospitality that is being exacerbated by the Federal Government's drastic changes to the 457 visa program.
The changes, announced in April, will abolish the pathway to permanent residency for key roles including restaurant managers, bakers and cooks.
The hospitality industry relies on foreign workers to fill certain roles, from a French pastry chef to a specialist in sake.
But business owners have told Lateline the changes mean a level of uncertainty that will jeopardise their plans for expansion — and ultimately impinge on the quality and diversity of the Australian dining scene.
Celebrity chef Neil Perry has about 3,000 staff across dozens of restaurants, including Rockpool, Jade Temple and Rosetta in Sydney, about a third of whom are on some kind of temporary work or student visa.
"[Workers on 457 visas] are super important for the restaurant industry because there are skills we need to bring in, both back- and front-of-house, in cooking, service [and] sommeliers," he said.
He said he had always sought to employ Australian staff in those positions, but it was not always possible to find the right skillset.
"It means we have to reflect on [any possible] expansion — can we or can't we. [With the] labour market saying [it] can't supply any more, we have to rethink what we're planning to do."
Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, in announcing the abolition of the 457 visa category, said the change was designed to ensure Australian jobs were filled by Australian workers where possible, and that foreign workers were not being brought in "simply because an employer finds it easier to recruit a foreign worker than bother hiring an Australian".

Will Aldous, a migration agent at TSS Immigration, called that scenario "ridiculous".
"Our clients go through an extensive application process, and face delays of accessing staff of many months while visas are processed," he said.
"Employers and visa applicants are vetted by the Government. It's not a quick fix for businesses; it takes a long time. The business that will typically use this program will do so as a last resort  — they pay $4,000 to $5,000 to bring someone in on a 457 visa."
Critics say the changes, which not only remove the pathway to permanent residency but increase the cost of hiring a skilled migrant and place a higher English language requirement on applicants, will create uncertainty for those currently here.
"These are people who have uprooted their lives, taken children out of schools in home countries [and] put them into an environment where English is a second language," Mr Aldous said.
"[They] now face the prospect of that dream being shattered because of this change in regulation. They will have to depart — some [won't] even work out the term of their of 457 visa."
Migration consultant Angela Chan said that would be problematic for an industry already facing a skills shortage.
"It was faced with a critical shortage before the abolition of the 457 program," she said.
"It's projected that there will be a skills shortage of 120,000 by 2020 of workers within hospitality and tourism industry."
A Federal Government spokesperson said foreign restaurant managers, bakers, pastry cooks, and chefs remained eligible for sponsorship under the new arrangements, "however they are not intended to substitute for Australian workers".
"The 457 visa is a temporary visa and has never provided a guaranteed permanent resident outcome," the spokesperson said.
"Current subclass 457 visa holders can continue to hold their visa until its expiry and will not be affected by the changes to the lists of eligible occupations unless they apply for a further subclass 457 visa or change employers."
Nino Zoccali, who runs Italian restaurant Pendolino in central Sydney, said the mood in the industry since the announcement had been dire.
"Everybody is freaked out," he said.
"Everybody is talking about key staff leaving and not wanting to stay because of the changes to the rules."
He said 70 per cent of his front-of-house managers were on a 457 visa.

"It's much easier for us and much less costly to employ Australian residents or Australian citizens but they're simply not there," he said.
"That's a big problem for us — when you have key managers in senior roles that you can't fill over a two- or three-year period it becomes quite desperate."
He said the best foreign workers would not come without the possibility of making a life long-term in Australia, and that meant the talent pool in the local hospitality industry would shrink.
The end result, said Mr Zoccali and Perry, would be a downturn in the quality of the Australian food scene.
"I'd love some permanent residency pathways for front-of-house people," Perry said.
"Service is a skill. If you don't think that, it's crazy to go out and promote [Australian] restaurants and tourism around the world and waste our money.
"Because if we don't deliver on the service promise when people come to Australia, they're not going to come back — it's as simple as that."

There is no urgency for Ten Network creditors to sign off on a recommendation to sell the embattled broadcaster to US television giant CBS, a court heard today.
Dr Andrew Bell SC, representing media baron Bruce Gordon, said a deed of company arrangement (DOCA) with CBS does not expire until December 15 this year, allowing creditors sufficient time to consider an alternative bid from Mr Gordon and Lachlan Murdoch.
Mr Gordon and Mr Murdoch through their respective companies, Birketu and Illyria, have challenged the decision by administrators KordaMentha to sell Ten to CBS, claiming that Ten creditors have not been told the full story about their unsuccessful bid.
A second meeting has been called for 19 September where Ten creditors will be asked by KordaMentha to vote for the CBS deal.
However, Mr Bell is seeking to derail the scheduled creditor meeting so the joint proposal from Bruce Gordon and Lachlan Murdoch can be considered.
"No evidence has been put in relation to any particular urgency regarding the DOCA with CBS," Dr Bell said referring to the December 15 sunset clause when the CBS proposal expires.
"Creditors are being asked to do something very significant in terms of their economic self-interest and should be properly informed."
Arguing that KordaMentha had acted improperly by only proposing the CBS deal, Dr Bell also suggested that the KordaMentha recommendation be scrutinised by an independent expert.
Justice Ashley Black dismissed an application from Dr Bell that both the CBS and Gordon/Murdoch proposals be put to the September 19 creditors meeting.
While agreeing that Dr Bell's questions were "very real and not theoretical", Justice Black cited the reluctance of all parties to agree to the terms of the proposal as his reason for refusing the application.
"It seems to be absolutely clear that the (proposed) amendment is factually based on whether there would have been any futility in putting forward a proposal that was substantially similar," Justice Black said earlier.

Richard McHugh SC for KordaMentha opposed Dr Bell's bid, saying it was unfair to permit any amendment without the administrators being able to properly respond.
Mr McHugh said his clients would require an adjournment to consider their response, which Justice Black refused.
The hearing in the NSW Supreme Court has been set down for two days and is scheduled to end late today.
However, in warning Dr Bell to expedite his arguments Justice Black warned he was prepared to continue the case into the early evening.
The court action by media rich-listers Bruce Gordon and Lachlan Murdoch is attempting to overturn the decision to sell Ten out of receivership to US media giant CBS.
The hearing also marked the first time that Mr Murdoch — through his family-controlled 21st Century Fox business, rather than his private Illyria company — intervened and joined the proceedings.

It may seem at first like an unlikely source, but Adelaide's oldest cemetery has released its very own olive oil harvested from trees growing on its property.
There are around 60 olive trees at the West Terrace Cemetery, believed to be Olea Europaea — a small and fairly common type of olive. The majority sit in a row between the property and the main road.
While olive oil is not necessarily the cemetery's core business, it is something its chief executive Robert Pitt believes is very special.
"I don't know of any other cemeteries that produce olive oil. We're quite proud of it, it's unique and we get a really good reaction from it," Mr Pitt said.
"We get a couple of tonnes of olives off them [during harvest] and my staff and some volunteers pick them, it's a fairly manual intensive job."
Each year, Mr Pitt and his staff partner with a local company to help press and bottle the oil. But this year's batch of 200 bottles is commemorating the cemetery's 180th anniversary.
"We have from year to year a variation in the quality, but that's my understanding of the fruit and of course it depends on the quality of the olives and when you pick them," Mr Pitt said.

West Terrace Cemetery is Adelaide's oldest, with the first burial at the site dating back to 1837.
The olive trees have been around since the 1860s, but how they came to be there remains a mystery, according to Mr Pitt.
"The first curator who took interest in the landscape was Henry Brooks. He was here from 1861 and retained an interest in the cemetery for 30 or so years after he left," he said.
"We think he worked with George Francis, the superintendent of the Botanic Gardens, and who brought the first olive trees to South Australia and produced the first olive oil."
The olive oil is part of an effort by the Adelaide Cemeteries Authority to help people think of cemeteries as not just a places to mourn the dead, but as spaces with a new lease of life.
"There seems to be a growing interest in death and dying, and there is certainly an interest in genealogy" Mr Pitt said.
"Also [it is important to educate people] about the roles of cemeteries as providing open space or space for passive walking or other recreation activities, and thoroughfares in communities."

The oil is only sold at one outlet, Jagger Fine Foods, in the Adelaide Central Market. Outlet owner Robyn Siebert said she gets all sorts of responses from customers.
"Some people are quite curious, some people are a little unnerved by it, some like to make good jokes about how well fertilised the olives might be," Ms Siebert said.
"I have some customers who live locally, so they really like the idea that it's a very local olive oil."
It is that idea of being local and connected that makes the West Terrace Cemetery oil unique, according to cultural heritage expert Alice Gorman from Flinders University.
"I think that is pretty unusual, I've never come across a similar example of certainly not in Australia, of such a thing happening," Dr Gorman said.
"What we're looking at the in the modern era is a new appreciation of cemeteries as heritage places that are important in connecting us to the past.
"Death used to be much more a part of people's lives. [Today] it's more likely people will die in a hospital or hospice so we have lost that integration with death in our societies."


The boss of one of Australia's largest nursing home chains told a 94-year-old resident she had to leave if she continued "intimidating" the facility manager.

Marie McLean had been at the Opal nursing home in Coffs Harbour — which is half owned by AMP — for six years when the managing director, Gary Barnier, visited her.
"He said, 'I've come to inform you that you've breached the Aged Care Act'," her daughter Kaye Campbell told 7.30.
"'We're asking you to leave the facility because we have documented evidence that you have intimidated the manager of the facility'.
"I said, 'You've got to be joking'. He said, 'No, I'm not joking, we have sought legal advice from our solicitors'.
"It scared my mum and he scared me too.
"I wasn't sure then what our legal avenues were. Was he able to just walk into the room and speak to us in that manner?"
Opal confirmed Mr Barnier met with Ms McLean and her daughter to "indicate unless their inappropriate behaviour towards the facility manager ceased, they would be asked to leave".
Opal said it had records which showed Ms McLean was "actively denigrating staff" and "had commenced an informal campaign to have the facility manager removed from her role".
Opal said it had a responsibility to ensure their homes are safe for staff.


Ms Campbell told Mr Barnier it was her mother who had been feeling intimidated by management.
Ms Campbell took the opportunity to complain about the lack of staff, especially at night, at the facility.
"His response was, 'we don't have any issues with staffing because we are owned by AMP and we have plenty of money','" she said.
AMP owns almost 50 per cent of Opal. The other half is owned by Singaporean company GK Goh.
There are no mandatory staff-to-resident ratios in nursing homes in Australia. Opal confirmed it typically has a ratio of one staff member for 20 residents at night, which "is in line with industry standards".
Mr Barnier ended the meeting telling Ms McLean she could stay as long as she didn't say anything derogatory about the manager.
"She just looked numb, like she didn't know what had happened," Ms Campbell said.
Ms Campbell said the meeting had a long-term effect on her mother, who changed from a socially active 94-year-old to someone who stayed in her room and needed counselling for anxiety.
"She was frightened because at that meeting they told mum, 'You are not to say anything about what happened in this room today to anyone'," she said.
"I don't know what he thought a 94-year-old was going to do to his company."
Ms Campbell's account comes after 7.30 broadcast the stories of two other Victorian families who said they had been bullied by Mr Barnier.
In one case Mr Barnier offered $10,000 to a man whose mother had died in Opal's Lakeview home. The Opal boss said the money was offered because the son was so distressed.
Since the story aired, the Opal board has commissioned an independent review "into clinical leadership, customer service and complaints management".
When 7.30 contacted AMP a spokesperson pointed to the review and said "we await the findings with interest and have been assured the conclusions will be made public".

However, Opal confirmed none of those interviewed by 7.30 will be part of the review.
7.30 also contacted Aged Care Minister Ken Wyatt to ask whether he would investigate the incidents involving Mr Barnier.
Opal's CEO is on two key government committees which advise on policy — the Aged Care Sector Committee and Aged Care Financing Authority.
The Minister said he retained "confidence" in Mr Barnier.
However, Labor's aged care spokesperson, Julie Collins, said "these are serious allegations that demand an investigation".
Ms McLean died last year.
Ms Campbell says her overriding memory of her mother now is the encounter with Mr Barnier.
"What I see when I close my eyes is my mum sitting in that chair totally shattered," she said.
"I will never get over it."


The ABS has released its latest Household Expenditure Survey, and it's not looking good for the average consumer.
We're spending more on the basics — $190 more per week — than six years ago.
We're also deeper in the red, with household debt doubling to $169,000 since 2003-04.
So how can you cut down on the biggest three household expenses — housing, food and transport?
Here's a few tips and tricks from the experts.

According to the survey, Australians are spending 19.6 per cent of their household expenditure on housing.
That's up from 18 per cent in 2009-10.
And for low income families that's even higher with the average household spending a whopping 23.4 per cent on average just on housing.
And when it comes to powering those homes, the amount spent on energy has jumped 26 per cent since 2009-10, an increase of 11 per cent in real terms.
A recent survey by consumer group CHOICE found the housing crisis was worrying 77 per cent of young Australians.
The survey found out of renters, 9 per cent of renters had deliberately missed rental payments, 28 per cent have had to borrow money from friends and family and 19 per cent have had to live off a credit card until pay day.
And for those who own homes, they were fearful of a rates rise.
So can you actually cut your housing costs back?
If you're renting, consider more affordable suburbs with good public transport options.
And if you're in a city like Brisbane or Melbourne where there's an apartment boom, make the most of it.
CHOICE spokeswoman Stefanie Menezes said you shouldn't be afraid to exercise your consumer power when it comes to negotiating.
"Balancing a household budget is never easy but there are ways consumers can change their everyday spending to make sure they get bang for buck," she said.
Last month the ABC spoke with Carbon + Energy Markets director Bruce Mountain on his top energy saving tips which included heating water with solar, choosing energy efficient appliances and looking at your insulation.
Check out his full list of tips here.
Australians are spending 16.6 per cent of their household budgets on food.
And out of the lowest income households that number is 18.7 per cent.
So how can you cut back?
Queensland mum Jody Allen is part of a growing community of bloggers writing about ways to save money online.

Her website, Stay At Home Mum, shares tips on cutting down your grocery bill and other savings hacks.
She started the website after being made redundant while on maternity leave in 2011, prompting a drastic look at her household expenses.
She told the ABC the first tip for reducing your weekly shop was using what you already had in the cupboard.
"So many people go shopping, and they still have so much food in their pantry, freezer and fridge," she said.
"Make sure you really use up everything you possibly can before going shopping.
"Another tip is to halve the amount of meat you consume," she said.
"Meat is expensive — instead bulk up your meals with rice, beans or vegetables.
"Not only will you save money, you will lose weight and be healthier."
She said her favourite and most cost-effective meals were simple "but simple doesn't mean boring".
"We have sausage casseroles, burritos, baked potato nights where we pick our own toppings, we make a lot of stir-fries as they are healthy and fast," she said.
Her other tips include planning ahead, freezing meat if you don't cook it that night, cooking meals in batches and avoiding the frozen food aisle.
"It is an easy trap to fall into if you are time poor," Ms Allen said.
Australians spend an average of 14.5 per cent on transport, which is down on the 15.6 per cent we spent on transport back in 2009-10.
For the lowest income households this is 15.7 per cent.
But it's still the third biggest drain on household finances.
So where can you make cuts?
You can start by looking at the total cost of your transport for the year.
It might be paying for parking near your workplace or catching public transport.

Once you've calculated the total cost for the year, take a look at how that can be reduced.
Could you park somewhere without a fee? Or carpool with a colleague?
And if you're catching public transport can you drive to another train stop with a cheaper zone? Or ride or walk to work one day a week?
If you own a car take a look at how much you're spending on insurance. Can you negotiate a better deal?
And make sure to do regular car maintenance — like filing you tyres with air and keeping the oil topped up — that will save you in the long run.
CHOICE told the ABC consumers should think twice before making any purchases on luxury items, don't renew your insurance without shopping around and beat the bowser blues by doing your homework on websites such as accc.gov.au on when and where to fill up your car.
"Choice's latest quarterly Consumer Pulse report found that more than half of all Australian consumers are worried about how to pay for health care, electricity and next week's groceries," Ms Menezes said.
"Concerns over the cost of fuel, car insurance and home insurance weren't far behind, showing the nation is feeling the squeeze on many basic services."


Flinders and Franklin streets have been selected as the preferred route for an east-west bikeway in the CBD, but traders and some city councillors believe it will be another Adelaide City Council "muck up".
The bikeway location was agreed to at an Adelaide City Council meeting on Tuesday night and design plans will now be drawn up.
The project has a budget of $5.5 million, with half of that to be funded by the State Government.
Councillor Houssam Abiad said the project would ensure improved road safety for cyclists.
"We need to make sure whoever wants to come to our city is welcome and know it's very accessible," he said.
Council documents showed the size of some existing outdoor dining areas along the route would be affected due to angle parking being changed to parallel parking and off-peak parking only being available along some sections of the bikeway.
Publishers Hotel director Peter Buik said his Franklin Street business was one of many which would experience a drop in customers when the bikeway opened.
"I'm totally opposed to it," he said.
"It doesn't produce economic benefit and the number of people affected outweighs the benefit, it's not worth it."
According to the Adelaide City Council, almost 400 cyclists use Flinders and Franklins streets every day as they ride to and from the city.
Mr Buik said he believed the bikeway would make an already dire car parking situation even worse.
He said customers often called his hotel apologising that they could not visit because they could not find a car park.
"Why are we spending a huge amount of money on a bike lane that no-one uses?" Mr Buik said.
At last night's meeting, several councillors expressed their disappointment with the current north-south bikeway which uses Frome Street and has been the subject of several controversies.
Councillor Anne Moran said the council should stop "flipping from one project to another" and learn from the "muck ups" of the Frome Street bikeway.
"It's [Frome Street bikeway] been denounced by the State Government, by locals and by local government," she said.

Several businesses along Flinders Street voiced similar concerns.
German Club manager Adrian Vomberg said parking was already a major problem for patrons.
He wrote a letter to the council yesterday describing how the bikeway would affect his business.
"If it goes through, our loading zone goes and two car parks [out of four current car parks]," he said.
"How can we contribute to vibrancy and trade in the area when no-one will be able to park in the vicinity.
"Vibrant Adelaide seems to be falling on deaf ears."
But Cr Abiad said the council would try to retain as much parking as possible.
"When you look at Franklin-Flinders street, there's a lot of little laneways with a lot of parking," he said.
"It doesn't have as much pressure on it when comparing it to Pirie Street or some of the other streets."
The council will consult with businesses in the coming weeks.


In a blow to Rupert Murdoch's takeover plans, the British Government will refer Twenty-First Century Fox's bid for satellite broadcaster Sky to the competition regulator.
Culture Secretary Karen Bradley told lawmakers on Tuesday that she intended to refer the takeover to the Competition and Markets Authority because of concerns that the deal might concentrate too much power in one company's hands.
Mr Murdoch's media group is trying to buy the 61 per cent of Sky it does not already own.
Currently, he owns British newspapers including the Sun and The Times of London.
Ms Bradley said she was also "minded" to refer it out of concerns about broadcasting standards.
She said there is a risk, "which is not purely fanciful," that the merger would not be in the public interest.
In a statement on Tuesday, Fox said it was "disappointed" in the decision, and that UK broadcast regulator, the Office of Communications (Ofcom), had previously advised the government that the deal did not raise concerns about broadcast standards.
But Ofcom said in a July report that the Sky takeover may "have the effect of amplifying the influence of members of the Murdoch Family Trust over the political process".
"We urge the secretary of state to take a final decision quickly," Fox said.
Fox also said the deal, announced in December 2016, was now likely to be completed by June 30, 2018, "subject to any further delays in the decision-making process".
The takeover values Sky, which broadcasts Premier League soccer and top film and television offerings in Britain and other European markets, at 18.5 billion pounds ($30.6 billion).
An earlier attempt to buy the remaining shares was scuttled by the 2011 phone-hacking scandal that rocked Mr Murdoch's British newspapers and led him to close the 168-year-old News of the World.
Ms Bradley's announcement was seen as a victory for Mr Murdoch's critics, who have been emboldened by scandals over alleged racial discrimination and sexual harassment at his US TV network Fox News.
They say Mr Murdoch does not meet the requirement that UK media owners be "fit and proper" people.
Ms Bradley said that, because of submissions she had received over the summer, "I am now minded to refer the merger to the (regulator) on the grounds of genuine commitment to broadcasting standards."
She said one area raised by critics of the deal was "what they termed the 'Foxification' of Fox-owned news outlets internationally."
British broadcasters are bound by stricter rules governing balance and neutrality than those in the United States, where Fox News' partisan style has won it a large audience.
It is "important that entities which adopt controversial or partisan approaches to news and current affairs in other jurisdictions should, at the same time, have a genuine commitment to broadcasting standards here," Ms Bradley said.
Tom Watson, media spokesman for the opposition Labour Party, congratulated Ms Bradley on her decision.
"This is the first time a minister in the current government has ever stood in the way of what the Murdochs want, and frankly it's about time," he said.
Douglas Wigdor, a US lawyer representing current and former employees who are suing Fox for racial discrimination, also welcomed the announcement.
Mr Wigdor, who previously wrote to Ofcom listing allegations against Fox News, said he was "hopeful that Fox will now waive any gag orders so that other individuals can provide relevant information without fear of reprisal."
Once a formal referral takes place, the regulator will have six months to conduct an investigation.
Sky said in a statement it was "disappointed by this further delay".
"Nevertheless we will continue to engage with the process as the secretary of state reaches her final decision," the company said.

The rapidly rising cost of essentials like housing, energy and education is pushing households deeper into debt, according to the latest figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS).
The 2015-16 Household Expenditure Survey shows the average family spent about $1,425 a week — $190 more than six years earlier.
Household debt had also doubled since 2003-4, with the average family owing $169,000. Property debt accounted for nearly 90 per cent of this.
The largest weekly expense for families was housing — such as rents and mortgages — followed by food and then transport.
However, the amount spent on power and energy had jumped 26 per cent since 2009-10 — an increase of 11 per cent in real terms.

Emily Maron and Peter Gagliardi have five children under the age of nine and balance their weekly budget down to the last cent.
They have amassed a $6,000 power bill debt, despite using a payment plan.

"Most of the money goes on rent. Food is a big one and school, and then the bills are huge," Mr Gagliardi said.
The family lives on $597 a week, less than half the average income.
"It comes to the point where it is ridiculous," Mr Gagliardi said.
According the latest ABS figures, the largest proportional increase of any spending category was on education — jumping 24 per cent in six years.
Ms Maron said money needed for school trips could blow their budget, with their eldest children needing iPads for class, and constant demands for special school days and trips.
"Things are always coming up at school that they can't participate in and that separates them from the rest," she explained.

Going back further, in 1984 it was food and non-alcoholic drinks that most people spent their money on, and housing was the third-highest category, making up just 13 per cent of spending.
The proportion spent on education has more than tripled over the past 32 years, while money spent on clothing and footwear has more than halved.
Across Australia, the Northern Territory and ACT spent the most on goods and services, despite Western Australian having the greatest rise in median weekly household income, from $1,111 to $1,782 over the past 10 years.
Tasmania saw the smallest rise in average weekly income, from $950 to $1,209, and had the highest number of low-income families.

The ABS said nearly 30 per cent of Australian households were over-burdened with debt, with mortgages the driving cause.

Not surprisingly, higher-income households were more likely to be swimming in debt, given their access to credit.
A quarter of the households in the top income bracket were over indebted, compared to one in six low-income families.
However, the ABS said the gap between rich and poor remained stable.
"The wealthiest 20 per cent of households in Australia has remained stable since 2013-14," ABS chief economist Bruce Hockman said.

Yet figures showed inequality in net wealth was higher than income inequality.
However, the St Vincent De Pauls Society said over the past three years, more and more low-income families had come to them needing help.

"They are seeing mounting bills and have to make choices every week as to what they can pay and can't pay, and always have that sense of dread about the next bill," the charity's Victorian CEO Sue Cattermole said.
"So they may ask us for food but in fact it may be something else that is a stress for them."
While Mr Gagliardi struggles to make ends meet, he remains confident he can clear his mounting debt and get his family back on track.
"I have worked out a 10-years plan, just give me another five years," he said.


The WA Government's decision to slug big businesses with increased payroll tax will lead to the loss of 1,300 jobs, a peak industry group has said.
Labor reneged on a key election commitment not to increase taxes when it handed down the state budget last week, lifting payroll tax on companies with a wages bill of more than $100 million a year.
Under the move, companies paying employees between $100 million and $1.5 billion will have payroll tax increased from 6 per cent to 6.5 per cent.
Unless it is blocked by opposition parties in state parliament, the increased tax will remain in place for five years, when it is estimated the budget will return to surplus.
WA's Chamber of Commerce and Industry (CCI) said modelling showed the tax would result in 1,300 job losses and also affect small to medium businesses.
CCI chief economist Rick Newnham said the tax would damage a fragile economy that was starting to show early signs of recovery.

"Thirteen hundred jobs is roughly six carriages of a train, so if you imagine six carriages pulling up at the football and everyone getting off that train that's 1,300 people that now don't have a job," he said.
Mr Newnham said businesses affected by the change had already indicated they would pass on the tax.
"It's false to claim it will only impact on the big end of town," he said.
"We know that those costs will be passed immediately through the supply chain to small and medium sized businesses."
However, Mr Newnham said modelling also showed the Government could limit the amount of damage the tax would have on the economy and jobs.
He said hundreds of jobs could be saved if the threshold for paying payroll tax was increased from $850,000 to $950,000.
"The payroll tax hike will cost 1,300 jobs, but lifting the payroll tax threshold will create 900 jobs," he said.
"So it will partially offset those job losses while allowing the budget to be repaired."

The outgoing chief of Wesfarmers, Richard Goyder has described payroll tax as a "dud tax".
Wesfarmers, which owns the Coles supermarket chain and Bunnings, is one of the state's biggest employers paying around $60 million in payroll tax a year.
Mr Goyder has estimated the changed to the tax will cost Wesfarmers about $10 million a year.


It was hardly a heroic fightback by beaten down consumers, but they appear to have become marginally less glum.

The September reading of the national consumer psyche by Westpac and the Melbourne Institute found, despite a slight pick-up, the overall mood remains downbeat, with pessimists outnumbering optimists for the 10th straight month.
"Pressures on family finances, concerns around interest rates, deteriorating housing affordability and rising energy prices have all weighed on confidence in 2017," Westpac's chief economist Bill Evans said.
"These factors are more than offsetting the boost from an improved outlook for jobs, particularly when a stronger labour market has not been associated with increased wages growth."
While consumers had a more positive view of household finances compared to a year ago, expectations for the next year fell — giving up last month's gains.
The consumer sentiment index edged up 2.5 per cent to 97.9 points, still below the long run average of 101.4 — where 100 is the dividing line between net optimism and pessimism.

Capital Economics analyst Paul Dales drilled into the survey and found that, while overall headline confidence improved, concerns about the housing market and household debt remained elevated.
"The share of respondents that identified real estate as the wisest place to put their savings fell from 13.3 per cent to 10.5 per cent, the lowest share since records began in 1974," Mr Dales noted.
"Based on past form, that's consistent with house price inflation slowing further, from 9.3 per cent in August to zero."
The "time-to-buy-a-house" index edged up marginally, but remains very low by historical standards.
Mr Dales also highlighted the share of people who identified paying off debt as the wisest place to put their savings remained high.

"This suggests that households remain reluctant to take on more debt to offset weak income growth and support consumption growth," Mr Dales argued.
"All told, these figures tally with our view that the pick-up in consumption growth in the second quarter won't mark the start of a sustained turnaround."
Commsec's Craig James says it appears Australians are growing cold on real estate investments.
"Putting money in the bank or paying down debt are still regarded the wisest places for new savings. And shares have narrowed the gap with real estate," Mr James said.
"A less frothy real estate sector would be very much embraced by the Reserve Bank."
Westpac's Bill Evans said from his perspective prospects for consumer spending and residential construction continue to be soft.
"We do not expect that economic conditions in Australia in 2018 will be consistent with the need for the Bank to raise rates," Mr Evans said.



Australian shares are likely to start the day higher, following solid leads from global markets overnight.

Risk-on sentiment has returned since the weekend as global markets were relieved that Hurricane Irma's financial impact was not as bad as expected, and North Korea did not launch any further missile tests.
As more investors put their funds in shares and the US dollar, traditional safe-haven assets like gold and the Japanese yen weakened slightly.
European stocks also rose to a five-week high, led by gains in financial and industrial stocks.
The S&P 500 hit a fresh record for the second day in a row, up 0.3 per cent to 2,496.
Nearly every sector posted trading gains, except for utilities. Some of the best performing stocks were in the energy and financial sectors.
Financial stocks were boosted by an uplift in government debt yields, as the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield rose to trade at 2.17 per cent — its highest level since early September.
Investors also paid attention to public comments by US Treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin about "tax reform" on Tuesday.
Mr Mnuchin said he was "incredibly hopeful" that by the end of this year a "competitive" tax rate for businesses would be introduced, with retrospective effect from January 1.
Apple also unveiled its latest offerings on Wednesday morning (AEST) — including the new iPhone X (to mark the 10th anniversary of its smartphone).
The technology giant also unveiled a new iWatch, which make calls without needing to link it with an iPhone like its previous watch models.
During the launch event Apple's shares had some wild swings — falling by 1 per cent, and rising by as much as 1.5 per cent.
Apple's shares finished 0.4 per cent lower at the close of Wall Street's trading day.
Meanwhile, US energy shares received a boost from rising oil prices.
This was after OPEC (the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries) forecast higher demand in 2018, and Russia and Venezuela confirmed their commitment to a deal that would cut production, in an attempt to reduce the global crude oversupply.
OPEC also said in its monthly report that Hurricanes Harvey and Irma would have a "negligible" impact on oil demand.
During the Wall Street trading session, an upbeat economic release from the Bureau of Labor Statistics revealed there were a record number of job vacancies — according to the JOLTS (Job Openings and Labor Turnover Summary) report for July.
Vacancies rose to a high of 6.17 million, while the "quits rate" rose slightly to 2.2 per cent
ASX futures have risen by 0.4 per cent, pointing to the local share market's likely higher opening.
Iron ore prices lifted 2.5 per cent overnight, which should bode well for the share prices of big miners BHP and Rio Tinto.
It will be a quiet day for local economic data. Westpac and the Melbourne Institute will release the results of their monthly consumer confidence survey.
Consumer sentiment has been negative for the last nine months.
Last month's drop was due mainly to concerns about slow wage growth, higher power costs, and rising interest rates.


A deal between a private company and the University of Tasmania will see the development of what the group says will be the world's first commercial rock lobster hatchery.
It is claimed Tasmania will become the birthplace of a global industry for rock lobster aquaculture following the deal between the PFG Group and the university.
Researchers at Hobart's Institute for Marine and Antarctic Studies (IMAS) hope the move will commercialise their breakthrough research into the lobster's complex larval cycle.
Until now, the lobster's long and complex lifecycle has made it impossible to farm the species in a commercially scalable hatchery.
Researchers said the world's first commercial hatchery could reshape the lucrative industry.
PFG Group, a Tasmanian plastics and maritime equipment manufacturer, has invested in a university spin-off company giving it licensing rights to the research.
Scientists at the IMAS Taroona laboratories will spend the next two years finalising development of the hatchery process while the company builds a commercial-scale hatchery.
The company said it hoped the first commercial production of farmed rock lobsters would start by 2021.

The university's deputy vice-chancellor for research, Professor Brigid Heywood, said the development had been more than 15 years in the making.
"For those who have not actually seen the facility working and seen science in action, it's unbelievably special," she said.
"It's a spectacular example, it's almost too exciting.
"The fact that we've been able to get to the point of real technology transfer, so that we're not just talking about it, we're not just anticipating it.
"We are creating a new world first, it can't be anything else but exciting."
Rock lobsters were farmed in Indonesia, but they were stocked by taking young lobsters from the sea.
Chief executive Michael Sylvester said it was an opportunity for a local Tasmanian manufacturer to develop world-class science and exploit that technology on the world stage.
"This ultimately leads to commercial hatcheries around the world and this leads to more Tasmanian jobs, and it leads to Tasmanian expertise being world-recognised," he said.
"We started out working with IMAS as a supplier of equipment and we grew that capability by bringing our aquaculture expertise into the hub and now we're a partner with the university."

Director of the research program, Associate Professor Greg Smith, said the IMAS team had taken work done on a laboratory bench to a commercial level.
"It's world-leading research," he said.
PFG Group chairman James Cretan said the sky was the limit for this kind of research.
"Someone's got to feed the world," he said.
"We sometimes underestimate as Tasmanians what we've got on your own backyard and the quality and the importance of this sort of applied science on a world scale.
"I think with recent developments in aquaculture we are now understanding the benefit of having a robust and sound science and unimpeachable science informing the growth of the industry."


Catching the train in Melbourne has become a physical sport that most commuters just aren't dressed for.
The pushing and shoving needed to claim a spot in a carriage — let alone a seat — is like a subtle form of judo, but without the comfort of any rules.
Success is measured by how long you can stay on your feet, but these days getting in the ring might be the biggest challenge facing commuters, according to the Public Transport Users Association (PTUA).
"It's twice as busy as it was 15 years ago," PTUA spokesman Daniel Bowen said.
Some relief might be on the way with Melbourne's rail operator Metro Trains subject to tougher performance targets and penalties as of yesterday.
That includes a ban on the controversial practice of skipping stations, which is used to meet punctuality standards.
But what happens if you can't fit onto a train that rolls into the station?
With the help of the PTUA, we've compiled a list of Melbourne's most overcrowded stations.

Caulfield is an interchange station for Melbourne's south-eastern suburbs, which has huge passenger loads from the Cranbourne, Frankston and Pakenham lines.
The PTUA says Caulfield Station, where commuters use tunnels and ramps to get to different platforms, struggles to cope with commuters during the evenings, and that's set to get worse when the Metro Rail Tunnel opens.

This inner-city station is best known for being the ideal walking distance to the MCG.
But with eight lines, it's also extremely busy and the tunnels connecting the platforms experience a crush of passengers during peak hour and especially after sporting events.
That's expected to get worse with Melbourne's population set to reach 7.7 million by 2031.
"The perfect storm is what it is," Mr Bowen said.
"Melbourne is a growing city and it's actually great that so many people are choosing to use public transport.
"But there are hotspots where the infrastructure doesn't cope."
Not very busy, but it's been singled out because of its design, which the PTUA says is poor.
The station has narrow platforms and no waiting area, aside from old bus shelters.

One of the busiest stations on the Frankston line, and trains are packed whenever there are delays.
Trains also have to slowly rumble over the tram crossing, causing delays and crowding on the entrance ramp.
University of Melbourne transport planning expert John Stone says he isn't surprised Melbourne's inner and middle suburbs are copping the brunt of the network's crowding problems.
"That's where population is growing," Dr Stone said.
"We're just not keeping pace with the services we need to match that demand."

There are queues to get onto the escalators in the morning at Parliament but during the evening peak, it's the last station pick-up in the city for three out of four platforms.
The PTUA says that means the passengers wedged onto the already-narrow platforms face the prospect of a packed train.

Melbourne's most iconic station and home to every train line, which also makes it extremely busy and congested. Some of the older platforms and the Elizabeth Street subway are short on space.
Over the last 10 years, there's been an explosion in the number of people using public transport, Dr Stone said.
"We really took our eye off the ball during the 70s and 80s and into the 90s when planners really thought that the city would be serviced by cars."
"There's really lost decades where we just didn't see public transport growth as something that was likely to happen, and now that it is happening, it's a problem for governments to catch up."
An inner-city station which is the last stop on the Frankston line just before South Yarra.
Delays mean crowding is so bad that people can't fit on the train.
Prahran is on the Sandringham line and is a stop before South Yarra.
There are trains every seven or eight minutes in peak hour, but any delay means commuters start to feel the crunch.

Kensington is the last station before the city on the Craigieburn line, meaning it's often crowded.
"If there are delays on cancellations, then it can really be a problem because often you'll find it difficult to squeeze onto the train," Mr Bowen said.
"You might be left waiting for several trains to go by before you can actually fit onto a service."

It's a trophy they'd probably prefer not to win, but passengers at South Yarra face the roughest commute.
The PTUA ranks South Yarra as the worst station for overcrowding during the morning peak because it's so close to the city.
"The next time you are crammed in like a sardine, when you get off that train, make a note to send an email or give a phone call to your local and state MP," Mr Bowen said.
"Ultimately the Government runs the rail network ... state politicians do need reminding that the funding needs to keep coming to help relieve the rail network."

Mr Bowen says it's vital projects like the level crossing removal plan continue so that trains can run more often.
"Running those trains frequently, not just in peak hour but also across the day, seven days a week, helps spread that peak load and helps more people use the rail network without having long waiting times between services," he said.
Dr Stone said the Victorian Government had some hard choices to make about Melbourne's transport future.
"The international evidence is really clear that if you try and build a city around both roads and public transport, as we're doing with the West Gate tunnel and Melbourne Metro, you end up spending more and not getting good outcomes," he said.
"The key is to provide a seamless network between bus, trains and trams. That's the sort of thing which gives you the opportunity to do very many more journeys than you can do now with public transport.
"People need to be be putting their vote where those sort of solutions are being offered."
Yesterday, Victoria's Transport Minister Jacinta Allan said the Government's new seven-year deal with Metro Trains was made with passengers in mind.
"We are cracking down on those things that really frustrate passengers, whether it the bypassing of the City Loop, station skipping, short-running," she said.


It's September, which means just like footy finals, Apple fans are getting excited after a new iPhone announcement.
Apple held its annual keynote presentation early this morning (AEST) and unveiled a bunch of new goodies.
Leaks in the lead up meant not much was a surprise, so let's dig deeper into the announcements.
Quite a bit actually.

The iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus are basically the normal yearly update we've come to expect.

It's got a new brain (what Apple is calling the A11 Bionic chip), a new camera (including a spiffy new portrait mode for A+ selfies) and wireless charging.
The 8 and 8 Plus cost $1,079 and $1,229 respectively.
It's the iPhone X where Apple has really pulled out the stops.
Apple CEO Tim Cook has called it the "the biggest leap forward since the original iPhone".
It's got an edge-to-edge display and an OLED screen for the first time.
Gone from the X is the Home button that's been a fixture on the iPhone since its launch in 2007.
You're going to be unlocking it with your face.
Yep.
The loss of the Home button means no more using your fingerprint to unlock your phone.
Instead the X will use an infrared camera and special hardware for facial recognition instead.
Apple says the phone will still be able to recognise you if you wear a hat, put on glasses or grow a beard.

The technology also knows if you're looking at it, so it won't unlock if you give it a passing glance.
It's not all serious though.
Face ID will power Apple's new "Animojis". They're emojis that will match an expression you're making with your face.
So if you ever need the poop emoji to look particularly shocked...you now have the technology.
In a bit of an embarrassing moment though, the Face ID didn't work first crack for Apple senior vice-president Craig Federighi during the keynote.


Apple reckons there is a one in one million chance that your phone can be unlocked by someone that isn't you.
It says the X won't unlock with a photo of your face or if someone is wearing a mask either.
Apple says all the data will be stored locally on your phone, not in the cloud. So there isn't going to be database of 400 million faces that someone could easily hack.
Foad Fadaghi, managing director of emerging technology analyst firm Telsyte, is taking Apple's claims at face value.
"Apple's privacy stance and lack of advertising business should help mitigate security concerns," he said.
Nope.
Bingo.
In Australia the iPhone X will cost $1579 for the 64GB model and an eye watering $1829 for the 256GB one.
Mr Fadaghi said some old mobile phones flirted with a similar price, so it's not unheard of.
"The higher prices mean greater likelihood of telco contract sales as well as longer usage lifetimes," he said.

The introduction of 4G connectivity is a big leap forward.
In short, it means you'll be able to use functions like making phone calls, sending texts or navigating using maps without your phone nearby.
It essentially turns the watch into a mini-smartphone.
Mr Fadaghi says he expects the introduction of 4G will push the number of Apple Watch users in Australia beyond one million.
"The ability to access streaming music services without tethering to the iPhone will appeal to those who want to access a huge library of songs rather than be limited to onboard memory," he said.
"Similarly we will start to see more Apple Watch App developers take their WatchOS apps more seriously."
Apple stock fell slightly after the announcement because of the delayed release of the iPhone X and concerns about Face ID, according to CNBC.
On social media, people had plenty of fun with the keynote.


But others were raising plenty of questions about the security of the Face ID tech.


Mr Fadaghi said months of leaks and rumours meant the normal excitement that would accompany a new iPhone announcement might be a bit tempered, but that won't stop people from opening up their wallets.
"Apple has an extremely high repeat purchase intention rate (93%) in Australia and the tech media narrative has been iPhone rumour focused for many months," Mr Fadaghi said.
"Android manufacturers have had similar features in their handsets for some time, but Apple's unique ability to market them will create demand in its customer base."
The iPhone X will be available from November 3, whereas the iPhone 8 will be released on September 22.

The Federal Government is facing an uphill battle to get its plan to overhaul university funding through the Senate by the end of this week.
Back in May, the Education Minister unveiled the plan to gradually increase student fees from next year and to make students start repaying their HELP loans once they are earning $42,000 a year, down from the current threshold of around $55,000.

Under the changes, universities will also be hit with a 2.5 per cent efficiency dividend for the next two years and some funding will be contingent on performance in areas such as student retention.
With Labor and the Greens opposed, the Government needs 10 of the 12 Senate crossbenchers to get its plan through.
Here is what we know so far about the way the crossbench is thinking.
Is the only confirmed yes vote at this stage.
But it comes with a condition attached. He will only support the bill as long as it is not watered down during negotiations with the Nick Xenophon team.
So that puts a big question mark over his support.
Nick Xenophon and his team hold three votes in the Senate, so the Government cannot succeed without them.
The party has been heavily focused on media laws so far this week and will turn attention to higher education once that is dealt with.
That means a vote could be delayed and pushed out until the next sitting in a month's time.

One Nation has four votes in the Senate and at this point has not declared its position.
But earlier this year, Pauline Hanson called on the Government to make students start repaying their HELP loans once they start earning $22,000 a year.
The Government will not agree to that.
Senator Bernardi also wants changes to the package.
He says he wants to save taxpayers' money and will try to make some improvements.
He is concerned about penalties for private institutions and wants to make universities more accountable when it comes to the job prospects of their graduates.
Senator Lambie is concerned about several elements of the package but willing to talk to the Government.
In particular she is worried about students having to pay higher fees.
She is also concerned about a decision to start charging students for enabling courses.
These courses help students prepare for university. Under the changes, institutions will be able to charge more than $3,000 and she is worried that will deter students from low income backgrounds.
Senator Hinch said the Government has not spoken to him yet, but he will not support the change to make students start repaying their HELP loans once they earn $42,000.
He said he would agree to $50,000 but no lower.
He also doesn't want to see any cuts to funding for institutions in regional Victoria.
Is still receiving briefings from the Government and has not decided.


Battle lines have been drawn between the gas industry and its critics over whether allowing fracking to resume in the Northern Territory could help solve the east coast energy price crisis.

The industry is using the idea of NT gas being a solution, rather than a problem, to persuade the NT Government to lift its fracking moratorium by the end of this year.
Gas companies are arguing that bringing more supply into the domestic market will bring down prices.
"Supply is needed to put downward pressure on domestic gas prices. And that is simply supply-demand economics," Santos CEO Kevin Gallagher said.
The big LNG producer, generator and retailer Origin Energy has the same position.
"We'd expect improved and increased supply would ultimately lead to a competitive environment and lower cost to consumers," its unconventional exploration manager David Close said.
Their assertion is supported by corporate analysts including Deloitte's Australian oil and gas lead Bernadette Cullinane.

"Overall if there is more supply in the Australian marketplace then that will make prices more attractive, and will bring down the cost as well as the price to consumers, she said.
But analyst Bruce Robertson from the green-tinged Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis points out that the Territory is a remote, high-cost location, with high pipeline transport costs.
"Producing high cost Northern Territory gas, which is very high cost gas, about $7.50 a gigajoule, is no way to bring down the cost of gas on the east coast of Australia," he said.
He blames the big companies for high prices, because they have committed to selling most of their gas overseas under long term contracts.
Under those contracts the companies are getting paid less because, ironically, international oil and gas prices have fallen due to a global glut.
"They simply cannot produce the gas cheaply enough to make money on their export business," Mr Robertson said.
"But what they're doing is they're making that up by gouging the east coast consumer.
"The high price is entirely due to cartel-like behaviour."
The companies are rejecting the accusation they are running a cartel.

"I think that shows a fundamental misunderstanding of Australia's east coast gas market, what export contracts and oil-linked export contracts mean, and what it means to be a stable investment ready destination, honouring and meeting its contracts," Mr Close said.
But Mr Robertson thinks the big producers are uneconomic.
He believes they are pursuing Northern Territory gas because they contracted to export more gas than they had access to, and invested in more LNG processing capacity in Queensland than they could fill.
"They are pursuing a loss making business because they basically can't afford to write off their plants at Gladstone," he said.
"And that is what in the end will happen, I believe, to at least half of them within two years. I believe you'll see them shut down, because they are the high cost producer in the world and we are in a massive global glut of LNG.
"Barring some major supply disruption like a geopolitical event, like a war, the glut's not going to go soon."
Mr Robertson is arguing that unless there's a big international price increase, Northern Territory gas will be too expensive for either the domestic or export markets.
"You cannot be producing gas at $7.50 and selling it for $6.90 on the spot market in Japan, as you are currently, it just doesn't work," he said.

But the companies believe the Territory's remote Beetaloo Basin, south of Mataranka, contains such a large and high quality resource, it shouldn't be written off.
"Commerciality at this point cannot be known without more data," Mr Close said.
"It will really come down to the well performance, the amount of gas that each well produces, the amount of liquids that each well produces and the cost of those wells.
"And until we know those data, these predictions made by analysts, they aren't accurate, they're based on false assumptions without data."
According to Santos chief  Kevin Gallagher, the economics — and whether development is worthwhile — are unknown until the explorers can appraise and test the resources underground.
"Santos is positioning itself as the lowest cost onshore developer of gas resources across onshore Australia, and as such, we are confident that if it can be developed economically Santos will be the company that can do that," Mr Gallagher said.
Central Australian producer Central Petroleum is continuing to develop its operation in Mereenie field near Alice Springs, because that doesn't require fracking.

Its managing director Richard Cottee is bullish about the prospects for expanding the Territory gas industry because he expects the cost of piping gas will come down.
"COAG and the Federal Government have bit the bullet of pipeline reform, the first tranche of which went through in August," he said.
"That will reduce the costs of piping gas, and also give the economic signal to encourage more investments in increasing supply."
Deloitte predicts the global gas glut will last until 2024.
Ms Cullinane is warning the United States, Russia and Qatar are producing gas at a fraction of Australian costs.
"There is a gap, that we need to very actively work on to close, but that being said, we can bring to bear some of the newest digital technologies and predictive analytics to be able to reduce that gap," she said.
And she believes Darwin has the potential to become a major gas hub.
"I believe the Northern Territory can turn its competitive disadvantage, its remoteness, into an advantage, and the way to do that is to co-locate companies in a cluster," she said.
"Darwin LNG has been joined by Shell, with the development of Prelude LNG and the Supply Base in Darwin, as well as Inpex, a massive project with onshore LNG processing, so it's now truly a tipping point where the Territory can become a global leader in gas."


Tens of millions of dollars raised by Western Australia's gold royalty increase will be lost to other states, raising questions about why the McGowan Government went ahead with the idea.
Figures provided by the Government confirmed that, due to the GST distribution system, more than half of revenue raised by Treasurer Ben Wyatt's gold royalty increase would eventually flow to the coffers of other states and territories.
In the next four years, WA will end up losing $50 million of the $392 million raised by the gold royalty increase.
But that will increase over time, with a spokesman for the Treasurer confirming that "roughly 60 per cent" of the additional royalty revenue beyond the next four years would be lost.
The confirmation that WA would lose a large share of the revenue prompted questions from the Nationals about why the Government chose to hit gold miners with bigger royalties.
Premier Mark McGowan said WA's bleak budget situation left his Government with no choice.
"If in the [previous] term in office the [former government] had not so comprehensively devastated this state's finances, these sorts of things would not have to happen," Mr McGowan said.
Mr McGowan said WA would have lost an even greater share of other revenue from other measures, due to the way the GST system works.
The gold royalty hike and an increase in the payroll tax paid by big business were key measures in last week's budget, which predicted WA would finally return to surplus early next decade.
But the McGowan Government is now facing a heightened prospect of key budget measures being defeated in State Parliament, after the WA Nationals vowed to vote against both the royalty and payroll tax increases.

"It is the wrong choice to increase a royalty on a sector that cannot afford it and will cost jobs and it is the wrong choice to increase payroll tax, which is the most insidious tax we have," Nationals leader Mia Davies said.
But Mr Wyatt blasted the Nationals' attempt to block the measures, saying it was hypocritical following the party's mining tax campaign both before and after the election.
"They have decided to take zero responsibility for the fiscal consequences of their time in government," Mr Wyatt said.
Labor needs the support of either the Liberals, Nationals or at least one key crossbencher to ensure its budget measures survive, a situation that is now looking increasingly perilous for the Government.
The Liberals have threatened to vote against both measures but are yet to make a firm decision.



Hurricane Harvey's floodwaters have triggered a spill of more than 1.5 million litres of petrol from two storage tanks along the Houston Ship Channel, marking the largest spill reported to date from a storm that slammed into the heart of Texas' huge petrochemical industry.

The spill measured 10,988 barrels, or more than 1.7 million litres, and occurred at a petroleum tank farm in Galena Park, east of Houston, operated by Magellan Midstream Partners, according to the Oklahoma-based company and accident reports submitted to federal officials.
Some of the spilled fuel flowed into a waterway adjacent to the ship channel, a heavily-industrialised area lined with dozens of petrochemical facilities, the reports said.
Petrol is more volatile than oil, meaning it evaporates more quickly after it has spilled. But it is also more likely to catch fire and can more rapidly penetrate the soil and potentially contaminate groundwater supplies.

The spill came after twin blasts rocked a chemical plant north-east of Houston as floodwaters receded in the wake of the storm that left dozens dead last month.
Magellan spokesman Bruce Heine said the petrol that reached the small, unnamed waterway had been contained. The spilled fuel was sprayed with foam to prevent it from releasing harmful vapours, he said.
"Federal and state regulators have been on-site during the recovery and clean-up procedures.
"Clean-up activities at the facility are continuing and we are currently removing and replacing affected soil."
The US Environmental Protection Agency said in an emailed statement that it was not aware of any environmental damage from the spill outside of Magellan's Galena Park facility. The agency said there was a chance the petrol would enter the ship channel but agency personnel were not aware of that happening.
The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (CEQ) planned to investigate the accident to determine if Magellan had complied with its operating permit and state rules that require the company to disclose any air pollution emitted by the spilled petrol, CEQ spokeswoman Andrea Morrow said.

Environmentalists criticised officials for not being proactive in publicising the spill and warning Houston-area residents that it had occurred.
Luke Metzger, director of Environment Texas, said the group had received anecdotal reports of people in the Houston area suffering headaches, respiratory problems and other symptoms associated with exposure to chemicals in contaminated floodwaters.
"They ought to know exactly how much gasoline was spilled, where it is now, how the state is containing it, and whether they should worry about any ongoing public health threats," said Kara Cook-Schultz with the advocacy group TexPIRG.
The spill was first reported to state and federal officials on August 31, but no volume was given at that time. The company later that day reported the spill was 1,000 barrels.
In a report filed last week and released on Monday (local time), Magellan put the spill more than 10 times higher at 10,988 barrels: equivalent to the combined volume of about 51 tanker trucks used to deliver petrol to service stations.
Mr Heine said state and federal regulators had been notified promptly of the company's best assessments of the volume.
The Associated Press has identified more than two dozen spills from fuel and chemical tanks that failed during Harvey. At least 14 tanks failed when their roofs sank under the weight of Harvey's unprecedented rainfall. Others were swept away by floodwaters.
Including the Magellan spill, the accidents have released more than 2 million litres of fuel.
Mr Heine said what happened with Magellan's tanks was "related to flooding associated with the hurricane," but would not elaborate and said the cause was still under investigation.
Government regulations do not require tank owners to take specific steps to make the tanks flood resistant, although researchers have warned for years they are prone to break open during severe hurricanes. In 2005 during Hurricane Katrina storage tank failures spilled millions of gallons of fuel into floodwaters.

A South Australian detective has gone on trial accused of abusing his position by leaking sensitive information to reporters, placing several investigations "at potential risk".
Peter Dawe Martin, 57, has pleaded not guilty to 10 charges of abuse of public office.
The detective is alleged to have leaked sensitive information in 2012 to Channel Seven reporter Michelle Vella and News Corp Australia reporter Nigel Hunt.
At the time, Detective Martin was working in the Major Crime squad which investigates serious crimes including murders.
Opening the trial, prosecutor Mark Norman SC told the District Court jury the detective knew "very well" that he was not authorised to pass on the sensitive information.
"As a detective in that position he had a particular duty to keep that information confidential, but he didn't," Mr Norman told the jury.
Mr Norman said the detective was a "gold mine" to the journalists because exclusive insider information was the "lifeblood of journalism".
"By providing that information to those journalists the prosecution suggests Detective Martin destroyed that confidential nature of that information and in the process police lost control of that information and he put several investigations at potential risk in one way or another."
Mr Norman said Detective Martin was not paid or bribed for the information, but his motives were "far more subtle and human".
"He was angry, he was angry at his police superiors for a variety of reasons," Mr Norman said.
Mr Norman said Martin was "flattered" by the journalists' interest in him.
"He was flattered by the interest in him and his work and he wanted to very much to sustain that relationship by helping them with their work as crime reporters," Mr Norman said.
"Detective Martin was, in effect, trading information for attention and he was prepared to betray his position as a police officer to do it."
Mr Norman said hours of telephone intercepts which would be played to the jury would leave them with "no doubt that Detective Martin was enjoying the attention, was enjoying the relationships" and was "doing everything he could to benefit them".
Mr Norman said there were strict police protocols about what information could be divulged to the media.
"There's no suggestion the press or media should be prevented from doing their job, there's no suggestion that having journalists as friends is, in itself, a criminal offence," Mr Norman said.
The jury was told the prosecution would have to prove the alleged leaks amounted to "improper" conduct.
The detective has denied any wrongdoing.
The trial continues.


There is a two-stroke economy in Queensland's property market, with the state's south-east booming while many regional markets struggle, a report by the Real Estate Institute of Queensland (REIQ) has revealed.
Centres hit hard by the mining downturn — including Rockhampton, Townsville, Mackay and Gladstone — saw median prices fall 27.7 per cent since 2012.
Unit markets in Bundaberg, Fraser Coast, Townsville, Mackay and Gladstone fared even worse with median prices plunging almost 44 per cent in the past five years.
The Gladstone market faced the most significant challenges with the annual median price dropping from $458,000 in 2012 to $295,000 this year.
The REIQ report attributed the poor performance to the mining downturn and a declining population in the regions.
In contrast, Brisbane's average house price hit a new high of $665,000 this year, up from $505,000 five years ago.
REIQ spokeswoman Felicity Moore said the increase represented "consistent growth for the market".
"This is remarkable given there's been some economic forces that have been detracting from the state's economy," Ms Moore said.
House prices on the Gold Coast also grew steadily, improving 6.8 per cent to $620,000 in the year to June.
The REIQ report said State Government investment and construction in the lead up to the Commonwealth Games had boosted the local economy.

The only blip on the radar in the south-east was Brisbane's unit market which fell almost 3 per cent due to increased supply and falling demand.
Ms Moore said in the regions, any future housing recovery would be closely tied to the local economies and populations.
"When jobs dry up, people leave town and that means there are houses in oversupply and that's what has happened," Ms Moore said.
"There are several mines that are setting up and ramping up their production levels … this is going to attract workers back to the area.
"Typically [workers] will rent, so you'll see vacancy rates drop a little bit and then they'll move into buying once their job security is a bit more firmly established."
She predicted that barring any disruptive events — such as a state election — regional communities should start to see recovery in the market.
"What we know from history is that people tend not buy and sell while we're in a campaign period and they'll wait till the election's been finished," Ms Moore said.
"Particularly as we get closer to that … we may start to see a slow down as the media attention on when the date will be set begins to ramp up."


Single-use plastic shopping bags will be banned in WA from July 1 next year. So will you still be able to line your bins and scoop up your doggy-doo?
According to the McGowan Government, the ban applies to lightweight plastic shopping bags — the thin bags with handles usually found at supermarket checkouts.

The ban also includes "degradable" plastic bags, which the Government says are no better for the environment than ordinary plastic.
The jury remains out on bioplastic and compostable bags, however. Labor is still deciding whether they will be allowed.
Stores will also be allowed to sell alternative bags which meet certain criteria, including thicker plastic reusable bags and "green" bags.

The ban won't apply to carrier bags needed for food safety — for example for meat and fish — while thicker department store bags and reusable bags will remain fine to use.
Councils will presumably be allowed to keep distributing those doggy-doo bags in public parks as well, or we could have an environmental crisis of another kind on our hands.
South Australia, the NT, ACT and Tasmania already have a bag ban in place. Queensland has vowed to bring one in by mid-next year as well.
South Australia introduced its ban in 2009. The SA Government says it has resulted in 400 million fewer bags in the state per year.
Compostable bags and paper bags are still allowed in South Australia.
According to the WA Government, "plastic bags make up a relatively small portion of solid waste and litter but can significantly harm marine wildlife and birds, which can inadvertently eat or become entangled in plastic bag waste".

A 2015 study found 60 per cent of seabirds had plastic in their guts, and that number was expected to rise to 95 per cent by 2050.
The plastics can cause blockages of the gut or perforation of the intestines.
Concerns have been raised that if customers can opt to buy thicker plastic bags at the checkout, it won't make much of a dent in the amount of plastic.

In the NT, an environmental group claimed the ban introduced in 2011 had failed to reduce plastic bag litter.
However in the ACT, in the six months before they brought in the ban, 266 tonnes of plastic bags went to landfill.
Two years later, it was down to 171 tonnes over the same time period.
So the amount of plastic weight had reduced, but people were continuing to buy boutique plastic bags and throw them away — but at a slower rate.
A recent Keep Australia Beautiful report found that plastic bag litter "fell significantly and almost immediately after the [ban] came into effect in the ACT and Tasmania, and remained down over subsequent years".
However in SA, it didn't fall as much and has now almost returned to pre-ban levels, while in the NT the ban appears to have had little effect, with lightweight plastic bag litter actually increasing.



Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull's trumpeting over yesterday's meeting with AGL boss Andy Vesey is nothing more than "Trumpean showmanship", says former prime ministerial adviser and business veteran Geoff Cousins.
Mr Turnbull called Mr Vesey to his office in Canberra to try to convince him to keep the company's Hunter Valley Liddell power plant open beyond its 2022 closing date.
While the Government says it emerged successful, the two parties have offered differing accounts of what was agreed during the 90-minute meeting.
But Mr Cousins, who has served on several company boards and was an adviser to former prime minister John Howard, said no government can instruct a CEO how to conduct their business.

"It's kind of a piece of Trumpean showmanship is all this is. You might remember when Trump first became the President in the United States, he was suddenly calling CEOs of major companies into his office," Mr Cousins said.
"What they do look to prime ministers for is sound government policy in the industries in which they operate, but they don't take instructions and prime ministers don't have any ability to give any instructions."
Mr Cousins, who currently chairs the Australian Conservation Foundation board, said the Prime Minister has been hamstrung by members of his own partyroom.
"I don't think there's any doubt about it at all. Malcolm Turnbull in his heart of hearts knows perfectly well that the important thing for Australia is to transition from this old technology," he said.
"I'm sure Malcolm Turnbull would like to do it, but it would appear that certain elements of his party have captured him and they won't allow him to."
Yesterday's meeting, which also included Energy Minister Josh Frydenberg, would likely have involved Mr Turnbull asking for a favour, according to Mr Cousins.
"The Prime Minister would have said to Andy Vesey, 'I'm in a bit of a spot. I'd like you to give me a hand. At the very least, say you'll take this plan to your board'," he said.
"Andy Vesey is a man of some conviction. He has made his views on what should happen in the energy sector entirely clear.
"But he would have said, 'I'll take it to the board. But please understand that it is a matter of long-term policy we do not believe investments of this kind are viable'."

Mr Cousins says AGL's decision over the Liddell plant would not have come as a surprise to the Federal Government.
"AGL and Andy Vesey, the CEO, who I know well, has made the policy of the company extremely clear a couple of years ago that AGL wanted to get out of coal, out of fossil fuels," he said.
"The Government just ignored all that, as it has ignored also comments from the banks that they are not going to invest in fossil fuels any more."
Government MP Craig Kelly also weighed in, describing AGL as "probably one of our biggest corporate villains" and accused the company of duplicitous behaviour.
"This seems to be completely contrary to the information that was coming out of the meeting with the Prime Minister, and I think it appears AGL speaks with forked tongue," he said.
But Mr Cousins said the Government's claim that it is acting in the national interest and that the company is only acting in its own corporate interests is untrue.
"I think the actions of the Government give the lie to that. The Government is acting in its own political interest," he said.
"It's a bit like Turnbull suddenly turning around and saying, 'We're not going to invest in the NBN anymore. We're going to revive the old copper network for telephony'."


The Ten Network's employees have been "poisoned" by not being allowed to properly consider a competing bid to buy the struggling broadcaster, a court has heard.

The court action by media rich-listers Bruce Gordon and Lachlan Murdoch is attempting to overturn the decision to sell Ten out of receivership to US media giant CBS.
However, whether Mr Gordon and Mr Murdoch were the "disappointed under-bidders" or "disappointed over-bidders" became a point of argument early in the packed hearing before NSW Supreme Court judge Ashley Black.
The hearing also marked first time that Mr Murdoch — through his family-controlled Twenty First Century Fox business, rather than his private Illyria company — intervened, and joined the proceedings.
Ian Pike SC, for Fox, told the court Fox was questioning why it would only receive less than 2 cents in the dollar, unlike other creditors who received a full payout.
However, the decision of Ten's administrators KordaMentha to go with CBS as the preferred bidder was a "completely disingenuous proposal", Dr Andrew Bell SC argued on behalf of Mr Gordon's companies.
Mr Gordon's commercial interest involves two entities, his private investment business Birketu and the regional broadcaster WIN Corporation.
Dr Bell SC said Mr Gordon was a "disappointed over-bidder" given his joint bid with Mr Murdoch would have offered 10 per cent more to creditors.
"The administrators have unilaterally made a decision not to put the competing Birketu and Illyria proposals to creditors for a vote," Dr Bell told the the court.
"This should immediately raise the interests of the court to be zealous to ensure full disclosure before the creditors meeting takes place.
"It is not reasonable to remove the decision from creditors of which vote to accept.
"Significant problems remain in the new disclosure (released yesterday by KordaMentha) and some of the earlier problems have been exacerbated."
But Richard McHugh SC, acting for Ten's administrators, had harsh words for Mr Gordon's legal team.
"There is no substance in the Birketu and Illyria complaint," Mr McHugh argued.
"The bid had conditions which made it less attractive and less certain."

He said the Gordon-Murdoch bid depended on changes to be made to Australia's broadcasting laws, which still have not been made by the Federal Government.
In addition Mr McHugh argued creditors would be worse off under the Gordon-Murdoch bid, which is allegedly "not open for acceptance" because it was submitted after the August 25 deadline.
CBS' barrister, Jason Potts SC, also appeared at the hearing.
He argued that Mr Gordon's legal team had made some "extraordinary" and "unprecedented" propositions.
Earlier Mr Gordon's legal team argued the value of CBS's vote should be restricted to just $1.
Mr Potts SC said the complaint made by Messrs Gordon and Murdoch is one which involves "an ungrounded, unanchored notion of commercial fairness".
Mr Potts argued that the court "would not find anything justify blocking the vote of CBS, a major creditor".
The hearing continues.


The Queensland Opposition has suggested duplicating a large stretch of the M1 motorway on the Gold Coast, but stopped short of promising to build the road if it wins government.
Opposition Leader Tim Nicholls instead launched a petition, in what he said was an effort to pressure the Palaszczuk Government to build it.
Mr Nicholls said the first stage should be a 37-kilometre, four-lane stretch between Stapylton-Jacobs Well Road and Nerang-Broadbeach Road at a cost $500 million.
A recent upgrade of one exit on the M1 cost more than $74 million.
Mr Nicholls said the existing stretch of road was reaching capacity.
"This is a transformative project … it'll help families, it'll help business, it'll help industries, it'll help the cities of Gold Coast, Logan, Redlands and Brisbane," Mr Nicholls said.
"We all know what it's like on a Friday afternoon when the M1 is chock-a-block chocked up with traffic and you want to get home."

But Mr Nicholls stopped short of committing to build the project if the LNP wins government at the next election.
"Annastacia Palaszczuk could end the uncertainty around jobs, jobs security by simply naming the election date instead of playing ducks and drakes as she has been for the past couple of months," Mr Nicholls said.
"When she names the election date we'll be starting to announce our policies.
"But the important thing here today is if you want to see a second M1 then go online, sign the petition and let the Government know what you think".
In March, the State Government and Federal Government jointly agreed to pour $500 million into upgrades on the M1 and three other road projects.
Transport Minister Jackie Trad said Mr Nicholls should instead be petitioning the Federal Government, which has refused to fund the road at the same level as other interstate projects because Queensland has refused to sell assets.
"He should be petitioning his millionaire mate Malcolm Turnbull to make sure that Queensland get its fair share," she said.
"If he is so intent on making the [road] an election commitment, he should actually be fronting the people of Queensland and making the commitment himself and also explaining to Queenslanders how he's going to fund it.
"Because this is a plan for a petition, not a plan to build a road."
RACQ spokesperson Paul Turner told the ABC the alternative corridor would alleviate congestion for residents in Brisbane and the Gold Coast.
He said it was very likely residents would support the project.

"There's also some major communities being developed on the eastern side of the M1 between Brisbane and the Gold Coast. This road would provide access for them as well, keeping them off the M1," Mr Turner said.
"Anyone who travels between Brisbane and the Gold Coast regularly knows that the M1 is very close to capacity, particularly during rush hour and that rush hour itself now goes for hours."
Mr Turner welcomed debate about the corridor and said he hoped the State Government would back the project.
"We think it is realistic. We've got to look long-term. The M1 is the busiest road in Queensland — 141,000 vehicle movements a day — we need some alternatives," he said.
While the RACQ would not say how much the project could cost, Mr Turner said it would be cheaper to build a new road corridor than make upgrades to the existing M1.
"If you're able to build alternatives off on greenfield sites, essentially, without having to duck the traffic as well, you can save a lot of money," he said.
Engineers Australia spokesman Chris Warnock said the debate over building an alternative corridor was nothing new and it showed residents were growing more frustrated with congestion.
"Traffic congestion is really the symptom, it's not the problem — you need to look at why people are travelling in the first place," Mr Warnock said.
"You can either try to say: 'Look, let's just build another road or build two more lanes on to the motorway', but I think that's very short-term thinking."
Mr Warnock warned against building more infrastructure to try and beat traffic.
He said another corridor would lead to more congestion and frustration in the future.
"If you build more capacity on your road networks, you will attract more people into their cars onto the road network and then in five to 10 years we will be having this discussion again," he said.
"That disconnect between where jobs are located and where the residential population is based is what's driving a lot of the traffic demand."


West Australian retailers will be barred from giving shoppers single-use plastic bags from next July, with the state becoming the latest Australian jurisdiction to announce a ban.

Shoppers will instead be required to bring their own bags or forced to purchase reusable ones from stores under the changes announced by the McGowan Government.
Environment Minister Stephen Dawson said the announcement had the backing of major retailers, and was confident any backlash from shoppers and smaller stores would be minimal.
"We will talk to industry over the next few months about our scheme," Mr Dawson said.
"There is public support for it now so we wanted to give the community some confidence that we are bringing in a ban across the state."
Premier Mark McGowan said the distribution of single-use plastic bags at shops had a devastating environmental impact.
"Plastic can blow all over the place. It can blow into our rivers, our wetlands and our oceans and it kills marine life," Mr McGowan said.
"We think the time has come."
Shopper Wes Capper said he could not see any harm in the ban.
"It's not a bad idea, to be honest. Save the planet a little bit, seeing as we're destroying it pretty good, I reckon."

Conservation Council WA chief executive Piers Verstegen welcomed the move.
"Plastic is created from petrochemicals, so it pollutes the environment when it's created and it also pollutes the environment when we dispose of it," he said.
"Overall this is going to lead to a massive reduction in the amount of plastic waste in our environment."

South Australia, Tasmania, the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory already have plastic bag bans in place, while Queensland is also moving to implement one.
In WA, the City of Fremantle previously moved to ban single-use plastic bags within the local government area but had the scheme voted down in State Parliament.
The City of Perth also flagged implementing its own bag ban earlier this year.
A statewide ban could also in theory be voted down in State Parliament's Upper House, but Mr Dawson said he was confident that would not happen.
In July, supermarket giants Coles and Woolworths announced their own plans to phase out the environmental hazards over the next 12 months.



Despite trading conditions holding near record highs, Australian business appears to have had a sudden crisis of confidence.

The respected NAB monthly business survey found confidence suddenly slumped last month, to be below its long-term average for the first time since mid-2016.
NAB chief economist Alan Oster said the sharp drop in business confidence this month was somewhat concerning, although the deterioration may prove to be short lived.
"For those indicating deterioration in confidence, the biggest concerns appear to be customer demand, government policy, as well as cost pressures — both energy and wages."
Mr Oster said while most industries appeared to be performing well, retail remained a concern with retail conditions languishing in negative territory.
"We will be watching this trend closely as household consumption is a notable point of difference between our relatively subdued growth outlook and the RBA's more sanguine forecasts, and will be key to the economy's sustained return to trend growth," he said.

Business conditions over the month rose by one index point to +15, well ahead of the long-term average of 5 points but short of the record 20 hit a decade ago, just before the GFC hit.
Employment registered the biggest gain of the three key measures of business conditions, while profitability and trading conditions deteriorated.
Victoria and South Australia drove most of the gains in conditions, although they were largely offset by a large fall in New South Wales while Queensland and Western Australia also experienced more subdued conditions.
Mr Oster said the positive news was forward looking indicators from the survey, such as forward orders, were relatively upbeat.
"Improvements in labour market indicators point to further falls in the unemployment rate, helping to mount a case to bring forward RBA rate rises," he said.
"However, there are few signs of inflation or wage pressures in the official data as yet, while relatively downbeat consumer confidence is still a point of concern in light of poor retail conditions.
"Additionally, the previously emphasised hurdles to growth — elevated underemployment, an elevated Australian dollar, household debt and peaks in LNG exports and housing construction - remain firmly in place."



Tough new laws will be introduced in a bid to crack down on dodgy company directors and their advisers.

Directors of Australian companies will be given a unique identification number to help stop the illegal activity of "phoenixing" — where companies are stripped of assets and liquidated, then restarted under a different name leaving creditors out of pocket.
Phoenixing is estimated to cost the Australian economy more than $3 billion a year.
The new Directors Identification Numbers (DINs) will allow authorities to track the activities of individual directors through various government databases and map their relationships with other directors and companies.
It is believed the Government is consulting on the best model of DINs to introduce.
Over the past 12 months, the ABC has reported on a number of "pre-insolvency advisers" who helped company directors carry out phoenixing.
The pre-insolvency advisers, or "facilitators", range from seemingly respectable accountants to people with organised crime links, and they too will be targeted by the new laws, which have been announced by the Minister for Financial Services and Revenue, Kelly O'Dwyer.
The ABC revealed last year facilitators were manipulating the corporate system by installing "dummy" directors in companies to shield the real directors from liquidators, creditors and the Australian Taxation Office (ATO), and were even able to backdate those appointments in the Australian Securities and Investments Commission's (ASIC) system to make it appear the dummy director had been in place for much longer.
As well as the DINs, the Government will consult on a range of other possible measures to tackle phoenixing, including making it no longer possible to backdate appointments, and stopping directors from being able to resign while leaving the company without a director.

Those suspected of phoenixing could also be forced to provide a security deposit, which the ATO could use to recover future unpaid tax debts.
Implementing a first-cab-off-the-rank system for liquidators was also flagged as a possible measure.
This would stop the appointment of "friendly" liquidators who turn a blind eye to phoenixing — a practice the ABC has seen evidence of in a number of cases.
There will also potentially be new specific phoenixing offences introduced, and an extension of existing penalties to capture the facilitators who advise phoenix operators.
The ABC spoke to numerous victims of phoenix operators, particularly creditors, over the past 12 months who expressed frustration with the lack of action taken by ASIC against dodgy directors and their advisers.
However, legitimate insolvency practitioners said the regulatory body was woefully under-resourced.
The ATO and other government agencies do have a combined anti-phoenixing task force, which has acted recently against some of the more prominent facilitators.

The ABC reported last year on Melbourne-based Philip Whiteman, a former bankrupt who was accused of helping scores of clients avoid millions of dollars in tax and payments to other creditors.
A number of people told the ABC they had been installed as "dummy" directors of companies by Whiteman without their knowledge.
The ATO took action in the Federal Court earlier this year to force four of Whiteman's companies into liquidation, and appointed accounting firm Pitcher Partners to forensically examine Whiteman's activities.
In a report tendered to the court, Pitcher Partners said Whiteman and his associates were operating a sprawling phoenixing operation, and might have committed too many crimes to individually list.
Labor's Andrew Leigh welcomed the new laws, but said the Opposition had been calling for the implementation of DINs for months.
"The Tax Commissioner confirmed the need for action back in May, when he told one member of a Senate committee that, 'I could appoint you as a company director without you even knowing and me then controlling the company'," Mr Leigh said.
"I don't know why it's taken the Turnbull Government this long to heed our call. I can only hope that they adopt the rest of Labor's plans to crack down on dodgy directors."


QBE chief executive John Neal will retire after five turbulent years running the global insurance business.
Mr Neal will step down at the end of the year, replaced by the company's chief financial officer Pat Regan.
Mr Regan joined QBE three years ago after an extensive career in insurance in the UK and is a relative newcomer to one of the more enduring companies on the ASX.
Mr Neal waited a decade to replace the 30-year veteran Frank O'Halloran in the top job in 2012 after QBE's fortunes crashed in the wake of the GFC.
Mr Neal was forced to slash the value of many of the businesses QBE had acquired up to 2007 in an aggressive growth strategy.
The company has struggled to regain its "market darling" status and in late 2013 its shares dropped around 20 per cent in one day as it announced further write-downs and big loss driven by its faltering US business.
However, the company has maintained its position as a global "Top 20" insurer with operations through the Australasia, the US, Europe, Latin America and other emerging economies.
Earlier this year Mr Neal had his short-term bonus cut by $500,000 after he failed to notify the board of a personal relationship with another employee.
QBE chairman Marty Becker thanked Mr Neal saying he "led the business through a significant transformation and a challenging period in the insurance industry globally".
Mr Becker said the search for a new chief had taken two years and had been conducted in consultation with Mr Neal.
"In the last 12 months Pat [Regan] has led a strong turnaround in the Australian and New Zealand operations highlighting his operational skills and business acumen and, in his previous role as group chief financial officer, had been pivotal in stabilising the balance sheet and enhancing the Group's capital management," Mr Becker said.
Mr Regan's base salary will be $2 million, with a 233 per cent incentive award on top of the base salary, rising to 350 per cent in the event of "outperformance" above targets set by the board.
That would translate to around $9 million with 20 per cent to paid in cash and 80 per cent in shares.
Investors welcomed the news with QBE shares up 2.5 per cent to $10.50 at 11:00am (AEST).



The world's largest car market, China, has indicated it will follow countries like France and Britain in moving to ban the sale of new petrol and diesel engines.

The Chinese Government has not said when the full ban on petrol and diesel car sales would take effect, but other countries like the UK and France aim to do it by about 2040.
The decision could see China, which makes and buys more cars than any other country, send shockwaves across the global auto manufacturing sector.
"The message would be out there, and all the other the manufacturers in the world that want to sell in China desperately will realise that the writing is on the wall," industry analyst Gary Glazebrook said.
"[Petrol engine manufacturers] will essentially be crowded out or legislated out of the market unless they switch to electric cars."
Professor Glazebook thinks China can implement the ban much sooner than European markets.
"The thing that has been holding it back up until now is the cost of electric cars and the fact that they didn't have enough range," he said.
"Well, the cars that are now on the market do have enough range and battery technology has been improving and getting cheaper, so we've reached that tipping point I think.
"To completely ban the sale of other than electric cars, I can see that they could do that with in perhaps 15 to 20 years."
It is a decision that has global implications for suppliers to the Chinese market, like Australia, where Toyota and Holden are due to close their last plants by the end of October.
But Australia's vehicle manufacturing and car parts industries will still be worth tens of billions of dollars to the economy, thanks in part to the Chinese market.
According to the body representing Australian car parts manufacturers, the ban is good news for Australia and could even see a revival of local car manufacturing.
Even so, Federation of Automotive Parts Manufacturers executive director Geoff Gwilym acknowledged there were fewer parts to sell to make an electric car.

"Currently those manufacturing operations make up more than 2.6 per cent of GDP in Australia, and it will still be around 2 per cent of GDP even when Toyota and Holden have finished their car-manufacturing operations," Mr Gwilym said.
"I think we could enter an age where we manufacture cars again, because it becomes a simplified process to some degree.
"Generally speaking, electric engines have got about 17 moving parts as opposed to hundreds of moving parts in either diesel or petrol engines."
As the world is making more cars and as electric cars become easier to make, Mr Gwilym sees opportunity for Australia.
"You are [competing with lower-wage markets like China], but automation will change a lot of that," he said.
"You don't have a casting plant, you don't have a machining plant, you don't have a plant that has to make engines.
"And if you attach to that different types of manufacturing technologies and robotics, then my view is that we will be able to make cars again."


Brazilian prosecutors are investigating reports that gold prospectors may have killed members of a so-called uncontacted tribe in the Amazon.

Brazil's National Indian Foundation asked prosecutors to look into the matter after prospectors were heard discussing an attack on indigenous people who live in the Javari Valley near the border with Peru.
The foundation alleged two gold miners were heard "boasting" about the deaths and paraded "trophies" from the massacre in a town near where the killings were said to have occurred.
They added it was believed "more than 10" members of the tribe were killed. If confirmed, this means up to a fifth of the entire tribe has been wiped out.
The foundation said in a statement that some prospectors have been detained for questioning, but they have not confirmed any deaths.
Federal prosecutors confirmed they had opened an investigation, but did not give any more details.
Survival International says the area is home to more uncontacted tribes than anywhere else on Earth.
The allegations have brought the Brazilian Government's treatment of indigenous people to the fore.
Isolated peoples are particularly vulnerable and indigenous groups in Brazil in general have complained that their way of life is increasingly under threat from land conflicts.
The Amazon rainforest has seen a growing number of illegal gold miners operating within it, disrupting indigenous tribes.

The foundation has criticised the Government for "openly supporting those who want to open up indigenous territories" adding that their actions are "setting indigenous rights in Brazil back decades".
Renowned Brazilian musician Caetano Veloso, whose music has been informed by injustices against Amazonian tribes in the past, also called on the Government to take action.
"Another deadly, violent and cowardly attack on the Amazon! A group of isolated Indians living in a protected forest in the Western Amazon was massacred by illegal miners in the region," he said.
"Fear has tried to stifle the news because this government does not like Brazilians, but loves the money from the miners who arrive in suitcases.

Wall Street's relief rally on Monday is likely to flow to Australia when the ASX opens its doors for trading.
There are several signs that investors were breathing a collective sigh of relief.
Namely, gold fell by 1.4 per cent from its one-year high as traders retreated from safe-haven assets, and the CBOE volatility index (VIX), which measures anxiety in the market, dropped by 12 per cent to 10.8.

The three major indexes finishing sharply higher (by at least 1 per cent each), with the S&P 500 jumping to a fresh record.
The main reason for the surge in US market is that Hurricane Irma was downgraded to a tropical storm. This means the likely damage it caused is not likely to be as expensive as originally feared.
Catastrophe risk modelling firm AIR Worldwide forecast that total insured losses in the United States would range from $US20-40 billion, which is much lower than its initial estimate of $US65 billion.
Furthermore, the market was relieved by the absence of geopolitical headlines concerning North Korea — as its anniversary celebrations on the weekend did not result in another missile test.
After Wall Street closed, the UN Security Council unanimously adopted a US-drafted resolution imposing new sanctions on North Korea.
Every US sector finished higher, with technology and financial stocks being the best performers — up 1.7 and 1.5 per cent respectively.
Apple provided the largest boost to the tech-heavy Nasdaq.  Its shares rose almost 2 per cent, ahead of its new iPhone being launched on Wednesday at around 3.00am (AEST).
As risk-aversion subsided in the market, the US dollar recovered. This led to the Australian dollar falling by 0.4 per cent against the Greenback.
ASX SPI futures have risen by almost half a per cent, which is normally indicative of a higher open for the Australian share market.
In local economic news, NAB will release the results of its monthly business survey (for the month of August).
"No hints here as usual," said NAB economist Tapas Strickland.
"Markets will be interested in the extent to which Business Conditions and the Employment sub-index have sustained their recent improvements — and whether Business Confidence and Consumer Confidence continue to diverge."
While business conditions reached their highest level in nine years (since the global financial crisis), consumer sentiment was negative for the ninth straight month.
It will be interesting to compare today's NAB business survey results with tomorrow's Westpac consumer sentiment survey.


Once again, mining giant Glencore has paid no royalties to the Northern Territory Government for its McArthur River Mine (MRM), a company report has revealed.
MRM, on the Gulf of Carpentaria, is one of the world's largest zinc deposits.
The mine has been plagued by problems since a waste rock fire in 2013 emitted toxic smoke, and there have been fears acid and metal drainage could contaminate fish in nearby waterways.
The company's report on its payments to governments for 2016 showed it paid "$0" in royalties to the NT Government that year.
It is the second report Glencore has released on its payments to governments; its first report, for 2015 payments, also showed the company also did not pay any royalties to the NT Government that year.
In a statement, Glencore said the NT's profits-based royalty regime allowed for capital investment offsets to be made.
"Over the past several years MRM has made significant capital investments including the Phase 3 Development project," the Glencore statement said.
The Northern Territory is the only jurisdiction to have a purely profits-based mining royalty system, but the NT Government recently flagged it was considering changing it.

Treasurer Nicole Mansion said mining had made a significant contribution to the NT economy, but that it was time to look at the benefits of the Territory's profits-based royalty system.
"I think it's time we explore those options in discussion and in consultation with the mining sector," she said.
"It's important that we do have a discussion to make sure we have the right taxation regimes in place to ensure that we encourage investment in the Northern Territory and economic growth and create further jobs in the Northern Territory.
"But we do have to have some of these harder conversations, as well, to make sure that we have got the right systems in place to benefit the NT."
Experts say under profits-based royalty systems, royalty payments can fluctuate.
They also say that for profits-based systems to be effective, governments need to keep on top of auditing because the regime has a complex system of deductions, and working out the profits of large multi-national companies can be difficult.
In its statement, Glencore said it was audited annually by the NT Treasury against its operating agreements.
It also said over the past five years it had invested $2 billion into the Territory economy.
"We're proud of our contribution and the widespread value it brings — we provide direct employment for about 650 people and in 2016 spent more than $320 million on goods and services, much of which was sourced from local and regional businesses," the statement said.
Glencore declined to comment on the NT Government's possible changes to its royalty regime.

The Australia Institute think-tank this week issued a report on the future viability of the mine.
Both the NT and federal governments are considering the company's Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) application for the mine to keep producing zinc and lead for another 30 years.
"Based on the company's analysis, it's very unclear how you could come to a conclusion that the McArthur River Mine is even a net positive to the Northern Territory economy," report author Rod Campbell told the ABC.
Glencore estimates the mine will pay a total of $435 million in royalties to the NT Government over 1,000 years, but Mr Campbell said that was an unrealistic figure.
"The only known royalty payment of $13 million came in 2008 after a historic peak in the zinc price," the report said.
The EIS estimated Glencore would pay $1 billion in company tax to the Federal Government.
The Australia Institute assessed this as unlikely because, "it is known that the company often pays zero in company tax".
"ATO data shows that despite $108,107,933 in taxable income, Glencore entities paid no company tax in 2014-15," the report said.


The head of energy company AGL, Andy Vesey, is being bullied by the Prime Minister, according to Federal Labor MP Joel Fitzgibbon.
Malcolm Turnbull summoned Mr Vesey to Canberra for a meeting on Monday over AGL's plan to close the Liddell power plant in 2022.
The PM wants AGL to keep the plant open for at least another five years or sell it to another company, like Delta Energy Systems which is open to buying it.
The Government emphasised Mr Vesey agreed on Monday to ask the AGL board to consider keeping the power station open longer.
But Mr Vesey told the ABC the company could find the best solution for the market without extending the life of the power plant or selling it.
Mr Fitzgibbon challenged Energy Minister Josh Frydenberg in the parliamentary corridors this morning and accused him of misrepresenting Mr Vesey's position.
"I think you're embarrassed for every day you've got to roll out and support the Prime Minister's desperate attempts to mislead the Australian community," Mr Fitzgibbon said in a heated exchange as the two men were in the parliamentary press gallery for interviews.
Mr Frydenberg hit back, accusing the Labor MP of defending big energy companies.
"You know that 10 per cent of New South Wales' power comes from Liddell. You know that there's energy companies making record profits on the back of Australian families," the Energy Minister said.
Mr Turnbull kept the pressure on AGL this morning, saying they were making a fortune from coal-fired power.
Liberal backbencher Craig Kelly accused AGL of being duplicitous.
"This seems to be completely contrary to the information that was coming out of the meeting with the Prime Minister and I think it appears AGL speaks with forked tongue," he said.

"I am a little bit angry, but it [does not] surprise me whatsoever — we've seen AGL, probably one of our biggest corporate villains, they've cut off tens of thousands of Australians, they've disconnected them from their electricity because of the high cost of electricity, they've been rallying against coal at a time when 80 per cent of their generation comes from coal.
"They seem to be saying one thing and doing another thing — they're claiming they're this clean green company when predominately they're a coal generator."
There has been an open tug-of-war between the Government and AGL over the future of the Liddell power plant.
Coalition MP Matt Canavan has questioned why the company wants to close the plant — rather than sell it.
"I have serious concerns that their current proposal to shut Liddell power station is about boosting their profits than protecting the energy system — it's certainly not about saving the planet, that's certainly not what AGL are doing, and I think that's becoming transparently clear."
Shadow energy minister Mark Butler said AGL's motive was clear and simple.
"AGL is the only group that's crunched the numbers of the viability of extending the Liddell power station after 50 years of age, and after it crunched the numbers it came to the view it didn't stack up," he said.
AGL will now prepare a plan for the Government, outlining how it will avoid a market short-fall if it closes the plant.

It will deliver that plan in 90 days, but Frank Jotzo, the director of the Centre for Climate Economics and Policy at the Australian National University, said the outcome was obvious.
"AGL have very clearly stated that the intent is to close Liddell and more broadly that they do not see a future for coal-fired electricity generation in Australia beyond the lifetime of the existing power plant — and there really is no reason why they would change their mind about that," he said.
Professor Jotzo was asked why Mr Vesey agreed to take the Government's request to the AGL board.
"I don't know what goes on in these discussions but I guess when you're being called in by the Prime Minister to take a proposal to your board you might say yes — and I guess in that context — we can observe it is highly unusual for Government to exert pressure on an individual company and intervene in an ad hoc way in what is a market-based system.
"It's really quite bizarre what we've seen going on here."


Early on Wednesday morning, Apple will pull the wraps off its latest iPhone model.
There's been months of speculation and rumours about what the tech giant will pack into its latest offering.
But after a new version of its operating system — iOS11 — was leaked, we've been given a pretty good look at some of the things Apple will unveil.
Specifically the iPhone 8, the iPhone 8 Plus and... the iPhone X.
Developer Steven Troughton-Smith found the names after digging through that leaked iOS11 software.

Because it's only been a year since we got the iPhone 7, it means Apple is skipping the traditional move of releasing an "S" model of its current iPhone before moving on to the next version.
But why the X?
It's likely to be a special model with a nod to the iPhone's 10th anniversary.
Say goodbye to trying to line your thumb up with the Home button.
The iOS 11 leak has confirmed you'll be able to unlock your phone just by looking at it.
Apple's calling it FaceID and we've already got a look at some of the animations you'll be seeing to set it up.

What's still up in the air is if this feature will make it to all three models because...
The hot-tip is the number-less version of Apple's new phone will come with an OLED screen that just about covers the entire front surface.
The new design has been all-but confirmed by website 9to5Mac, which dug up images from inside iOS11 which show the new form.
It's probably why Apple has decided to go the FaceID route on the X. With all that screen there isn't room for the Home button that's been a part of the iPhone since its launch in 2007.
We don't know if the Home button, or the OLED screen, will make an appearance on the iPhone 8.
Samsung raised eyebrows with its $1,499 price tag for its Galaxy Note 8 and the rumours say the iPhone X might fly close to that mark.
It also might arrive a bit later than cheaper iPhone 8 models because of production delays on those OLED screens, according to TechCrunch.
They're called "Animoji".

They'll use facial tracking and your voice to create animated versions of your favourite emoji.
Yes....even the poo emoji.

There's references in iOS11 to a revised version of the AirPods Apple released when it killed off the headphone jack with the iPhone 7.
Apple is all in on wireless, for better or worse.
The big keynote speech begins at 3:00am on Wednesday. Set your alarm clocks!


Energy provider AGL appears to be ruling out selling or extending the life of the Liddell power station, despite the Federal Government declaring that is still an option.

Energy Minister Josh Frydenberg said yesterday's meeting between AGL and the Government ended with a range of options, including keeping the Liddell plant open for an extra five years beyond 2022.
After the 90-minute meeting, Mr Frydenberg said AGL's managing director had agreed to ask the company's board to consider delaying the closure or selling the power station.
But the company's chief executive Andy Vesey appeared to strike that down.
"I think that we are committed to finding the best solution for the market, we believe we can deliver that without having to consider the extension or sell the plant and that's what we're going to work on," Mr Vesey told the ABC.
Mr Frydenberg said AGL had also proposed an alternative which was to produce the equivalent amount of electricity from another source.
Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull announced last week he wanted AGL to keep the Liddell power station, the oldest coal-fired plant still running in Australia, operating for five years beyond its due closure date in 2022.
After that, Mr Vesey tweeted that "keeping old coal power plants open won't deliver the reliable, affordable energy our customers need".
He said AGL was "getting out of coal" and emphasised it was committed to the closure of the Liddell power station in 2022, the end of its operating life.
Despite those comments apparently opposing the Government's plan, Mr Frydenberg said yesterday's meeting between Mr Vesey and the Prime Minister and other Cabinet ministers was constructive.
Mr Frydenberg said AGL did not ask the Federal Government to pay yesterday for keeping the power station open longer.
"That was not the discussion today," he said.

Earlier, AGL issued a statement indicating it was still committed to closing the power plant.
"Following today's meeting with the Prime Minister, we have committed to deliver a plan in 90 days of the actions AGL will take to avoid a market shortfall once the Liddell coal-fired power station retires in 2022."
Mr Vesey's statement said renewables with gas back-up would be the favoured power source in the short-term, and beyond that it would be large-scale batteries supporting renewables.
"In this environment, we just don't see new development of coal as economically rational, even before factoring in a carbon cost," he said in the statement.
In a further sign AGL did not favour the Government's plan to keep Liddell open, Mr Vesey said by giving advanced notice of the closure of its coal-fired plants, including Liddell, AGL was meeting one of the 49 recommendations in the Finkel report that had been accepted by the Government.
"The long notice period we have given reflects our commitment to managing carbon risk for shareholders and avoiding the volatility created by recent sudden withdrawal of capacity," Mr Vesey said.
Energy spokesman for the Greens Adam Bandt said the Prime Minister's meeting with AGL had been a "fizzer".
"AGL's board will discuss what they were going to discuss anyway," he said.
"Given AGL indicated to the minister that their preference is for additional new supply and that the company is getting out of coal, we are expecting to see a plan in 90 days for more renewables and storage."


The Federal Government is being urged to make the introduction of driverless cars a priority, in the hope of slashing the road toll.
But a report delivered today acknowledges there are plenty of questions over the technology's introduction to Australian roads.
It considered the full range of what it calls 'automated vehicles' — from cars and trucks that can take some control over steering and speed, to cars that can control the entire operation, giving the passenger no responsibility at all.

They include how automated vehicles will respond in dangerous situations, liability for accidents, the potential for vehicles to be hacked, and ownership of data the car produces.
But the parliamentary report found that given the potential for a dramatic reduction in fatalities and other accidents, those questions should be answered quickly.

The Standing Committee on Industry, Innovation, Science and Resources specifically looked into social issues surrounding the vehicles' introduction.
It found the technology will need to earn a "social licence" before it is widely accepted, and overcome the general discomfort some may feel about having a computer take control of their car.
The committee found the best way to overcome many of these issues is literally put people behind the wheel of a driverless car: It urged the Government to run public trials "that enable members of the public to experience automated vehicles on public roads".
The committee's chair, Nationals MP Michelle Landry, said public nervousness about automated vehicles was to be expected.
"It will take a while, people are always a bit wary of what they don't know and don't understand," she said.
"But I think the more we have things like automated buses, automated trains, I do believe that the taxi industry will probably get on board early in the piece, that it will be more accepted.
"But I think the advantages will outweigh the disadvantages."

The report identified the enormous potential to improve safety on the roads as the single most significant change automated vehicles will bring.
It heard evidence that human error may be a factor in over 90 percent of crashes — meaning if human error could eventually be eliminated, the number of road accidents could potentially plummet.

The committee concluded the safety gains are so great, they alone make the technology worth pursuing.
"Given the wide range of witnesses arguing that autonomous, or even highly automated, vehicles could lead to a substantial reduction in the number of deaths and injuries on Australian roads, the committee is of the view that this important social goal should make the introduction of these vehicles a priority for Australia," it found.
It also tackled the complex issue of ethics around driverless vehicles — in particular, who takes responsibility when they crash.
Car manufacturer Volvo has indicated it is willing to accept "full liability for damages or injuries whenever one of its cars is in full autonomous mode".
It called on the Federal Government to mandate that all other car manufacturers eventually selling autonomous vehicles take the same position.

Ms Landry said clear regulation in the area will be required.
"I'm actually thinking it might have to be federal legislation, so it goes right across the country," she said.
"Because it's a whole different way of operating vehicles."
The question becomes more complex when it comes to partially automated cars — a likely stepping stone on the way to fully driverless vehicles.
The report did not land on a firm position on the question, but stated it is critical the public is made part of the process, as the tricky questions are eventually answered.
Autonomous vehicles will bring opportunity, but will also undoubtedly cost jobs.
The most obvious are professional drivers: in trucking, public transport, taxi driving and elsewhere.

It's not just drivers however, with the impact to reach as far as crash repairers, traffic police, insurers, and even lawyers put out of work by the reduction in traffic accidents.
The committee heard evidence that while new jobs will be created, automated vehicles will likely result in an overall reduction in jobs.
But Ms Landry put forward an optimistic view, that it is hard to predict the jobs of the future.
"It's the same as now, when we say to the kids starting school that a lot of the jobs they'll have haven't even been thought of yet," she said.
"It's very exciting, we're excited about it all — and there's a lot more to come with it."
It was also suggested that given the decades it will take for the technology to fully roll out, many people currently in driving occupations will have retired by the time their job becomes redundant.
The movement towards self-driving cars suffered a blow in 2015, when Fiat Chrysler had to recall 1.4 million cars in the United States over the potential for them to be hacked.
Hacking becomes an even greater concern when cars are being driven entirely by computers.
But David Pickett from Volvo Australia assured the committee it was no longer possible.
"For someone to get in and start controlling something is quite a different design to what the car is set up to do," he said.
"It is not designed to take that sort of input."
But the report is recommending the National Cyber Security Strategy look into autonomous vehicles regardless.
It also raised the issue of data security, given autonomous cars will be collecting large quantities of data on when and where people travel.
It recommended further investigation into establishing exactly who owns data produced by a car, and the rights of consumers, manufacturers, insurers and government agencies.



For nearly a decade, residents in and around Ellenbrook have been told they could get a new train line — only to be left disappointed.
But the McGowan Government is adamant its decision not to allocate any money to construct a new line to Ellenbrook is not another let-down for people in Perth's north-east.
While the only money in last week's budget for the Ellenbrook train line was funds to plan and develop a business case, Transport Minister Rita Saffioti insisted the project would not be delayed.
Under existing plans, that would mean construction underway in 2019 and trains running on the line in 2022.
"We are in the process of planning for that project," Ms Saffioti said.
"We are starting from scratch on that project, there was no planning done, so we are going through that business case exercise."
Both major parties promised ahead of the 2008 election to build an Ellenbrook train line, but the Liberal-National Government dumped the plan after coming into office.
Shadow treasurer Dean Nalder said Ellenbrook residents would rightly be sceptical about whether the new government would deliver the new line without money in the budget to construct it.
"There has to be budget for it and they haven't allowed for that, so it looks like another broken promise," he said.
"They had this as an election commitment in 2008 so you'd think they would have it worked up by now."
But Ms Saffioti said she would be trying to lock in federal funding for the Ellenbrook line "as soon as possible", having previously won Commonwealth support for the Government's other Metronet plans.

Last week's budget also revealed nearly $200 million in Metronet cost blowouts in the six months since the election.
The price of the new Thornlie-to-Cockburn train line and the extension of the Joondalup line to Yanchep have both risen considerably since Labor's pre-election forecasts, which were not scrutinised by Treasury.
But Treasurer Ben Wyatt downplayed the increased cost.
"It is budget one, there is still work to do on these projects but I am fairly relaxed they will come in as we expect," Mr Wyatt said.
"We have to actually plan these projects … it's not just about having the money in the budget, you have got to do the work around it."
The first stage of Metronet also includes an extension of the Armadale line to Byford.


Qantas executives grilled about why regional airfares in Western Australia can be so expensive have rejected suggestions they are "gouging" residents, seeking to blame high regional airport costs.
A state parliamentary inquiry is examining why regional airfares are high and what the airlines and WA Government could do about it.
In an at-times heated exchange, Economics and Industry Standing Committee chair Jessica Shaw told Qantas executives that when people from across regional WA needed to quickly book a plane ticket for a family or health emergency, they faced "exorbitant fares".
"It's not a luxury for these people. It's a necessity," she said.
"Communities are hurting," Ms Shaw added, asking the executives where the airline's compassion and corporate social responsibility to these towns was.
Qantas Domestic chief executive Andrew David said that type of last minute, high cost airfare accounted for only 2 per cent of total travel.
But he said Qantas had sought recently to address the issue by announcing discounts of up to 30 per cent for people living in six regional centres.

Qantas also argued its airfares to regional WA were lower now than in 2013, even though demand had dropped significantly with the mining slowdown.
Mr David said a key problem driving up airfares was that eight of the state's regional airports were among the top 15 most expensive in its domestic network, with high maintenance, labour and other costs.
But Ms Shaw said the inquiry had heard in earlier hearings that airport costs were a very small proportion of plane fares.
Airports Association of Australia chief executive Caroline Wilkie later told the hearing airport costs made up only 5-13 per cent of regional airfares, and most regional airports operated at a loss.
But Qantas group executive for government and industry Andrew Parker did not accept the premise airport costs were an insignificant part of airfares.
He said Broome airport cost airlines double what Cairns did.
"So something is not right here," Mr Parker said.
Mr Parker denied Qantas was making large profits in regional WA, saying airlines made only $7 profit per passenger per flight.
He said many WA regional routes were unique in that they were driven by the mining sector, with planes leaving Perth full and returning almost empty, and price discounting would not help to fill those return flights.
Committee member Stephen Price wanted the executives to give the inquiry detailed information on how fares were priced to help address community concern and anger.
"In their view, you are gouging them for everyday transport," Mr Price said.
Mr Parker promised to give the committee more information if commercially possible.
Asked about the prospect of regulating failing routes, he said regulation had historically not worked and had even driven up prices.
Qantas argued for greater government investment to stimulate regional tourism, welcoming the Government's $36 million pledge in last week's budget to grow the industry.
It also wants a change in the way airlines and airport operators negotiated costs, to try and drive down what they pay.


The Ten Network's administrators have caved to pressure from "disappointed underbidders", and provided further details on why it chose to sell the embattled network to US broadcaster CBS.
The underbidders in this case are billionaire investors Bruce Gordon and Lachlan Murdoch, whose joint bid lost out to CBS.
Their pressure culminated in Mr Gordon (through his companies Birketu and WIN Corporation) launching an urgent case in the Supreme Court of NSW last week, due to alleged deficiencies in the creditors' report.
The key deficiency is namely that the report "fails to include adequate information" on the billionaire duo's competing bid.
But KordaMentha maintains that its second creditors' report (released September 4) "was both compliant and provided the necessary and material information required by creditors to make an informed decision on the future of the Ten Network".
The first stage of Mr Gordon's court action was successful as it resulted in the next creditors' meeting being postponed by one week (to September 19).
The primary considerations, in comparing the competing bids, include the financial return to creditors, "complexity and risks" (including "certainty of execution and structure") and the "timeframe for completion", said KordaMentha partner, Mark Korda.
In its supplementary report released on Monday, KordaMentha sought to explain that the CBS bid was a "superior" deal for creditors by comparing the financial aspects of both bids.
CBS would return $32 million to creditors (or 12.43c in the dollar), while the Gordon-Murdoch deal — through their private companies Birketu and Illyria — would give back a lower amount of $27.6 million (or 10.58 cents in the dollar).
The administrators also took into account the conditions of both deals, and decided that "the CBS transaction was more certain as it had a lower execution risk".

Messrs Gordon and Murdoch are banking on the Federal Government passing the Media Law Reform Bill, which Labor, The Greens and many crossbenchers strongly oppose.
The extent of their significant media ownership interests currently prevents them from taking over the Ten Network.
If the bill is passed, it would abolish the "two out of three rule", which prevents an individual or a company owning a newspaper, TV station and radio station in the same licence area.
It would also remove the "75 per cent audience reach rule", which prevents a single TV broadcaster from reaching more than 75 per cent of the population.
CBS has the clear advantage in that it can acquire Ten without the need for Australia's media laws to be specially amended.
The administrators, who are highly critical of Mr Gordon's court action, said, "It is not the usual practice of administrators to report details of underbidders."
"It is disappointing that Birketu [Mr Gordon's company] either directly or via related parties have pursued court action, delaying the creditors vote and putting at risk the certainty provided to 750 employees and creditors under the CBS transaction."
This matter will continue to be heard by the Supreme Court of NSW on Tuesday and Wednesday.


A team of students at Adelaide's Flinders University has built a solar-powered car that can carry three people, to compete in this year's World Solar Challenge (WSC).
Teams are now gearing up ahead of the 3,000 kilometre race from Darwin to Adelaide, which will feature solar cars from around the world.
This is the first year Flinders University has taken part.
"Our aim initially is to finish the race — that's first and foremost," said team director Stuart Wildy, at the launch of the car.
"Being the first time we're not expecting to win the competition, but we're hoping to get across the line."
Flinders will compete in the cruiser class, in which teams are also judged on the practicality of their cars.
"The original design that we had for the car was to try and have it as a normal, standard, road family car ... something people would like to see and like to drive," Dr Wildy said.
He said time constraints meant some design elements had to be scrapped.
"One of the features we didn't get in there this year is regenerative suspension, but hopefully that'll be for 2019.
"We were able to get a windshield which is made out of gorilla glass, which is lightweight material ... and the solar cells are encapsulated in fibreglass."

Dr Wildy said there was still much work to do on the vehicle, and getting it ready in time would come "down a little bit to the wire".
"Most of the mechanical work is done. The next stage is to put all the electronics in there so we can actually start driving the vehicle," he said.
"Most of that's been prototyped on our little prototype vehicle we've got and so from there we should just be able to put the components in and off we go."
The team of about 20 people will leave for Darwin later this month.
"We've got a great team, they've been fantastic. We've got people who are engineers, IT, business. We've also got a nutritionist who's designed the meal plan for us."
The race begins in Darwin on October 8, with the winners expected to cross the finish line in Victoria Square around October 12.


The consumer watchdog is ramping up its warnings about scammers who are targeting older victims to pay for alleged services with iTunes gift cards.
The ACCC says more than 1,200 people have lost $540,000 so far this year to scammers who ask for serial numbers of the cards and then quickly sell them elsewhere for profit.
The fraudsters are posing as representatives from the Australian Tax Office, Telstra and Centrelink and cold call victims offering to help fast track pension payments or to resolve technical problems.

One victim of the scam, 74-year-old Richard from regional Victoria, said he normally is able to spot scams quite confidently.
"There was a computer-generated voice saying it was Centrelink in Canberra, and there'd been a cock-up in their system and I was owed $2,480 in back pension, and I was to phone this number ASAP," Richard said.
"[The man who I spoke to] was quite convincing, and said that to retrieve this money, I had to buy $300 worth of iTunes.
"I went to Coles, bought the tickets, came home and phone him back. I had to give him a swag of numbers so he could validate them."
Once the scam caller had the codes, they would have sold the value of the card over the internet and moved on to their next victim.
"If you told me this story I wouldn't believe it. I would say nobody could be that bloody stupid," Richard said.
Deputy ACCC chair Delia Rickard said scammers typically create a sense of fear or urgency to manipulate their victims.
"A lot of people do find it embarrassing, but I think what we have to remember is just how good scammers are at convincing people and turning off that rational side of their brain," Ms Rickard said.
"They'll pretend to be the Tax Office telling you that you owe tax, they'll pretend to be Telstra asking to help them catch a hacker, or possibly Centrelink saying you're entitled to more benefits.
"They will then ask you to go and purchase iTunes gift cards. It could be hundreds of dollars, but sometimes thousands of dollars' worth."

Ms Rickard said the best practice to follow if you receive a call asking for payment through an iTunes gift card is to hang up immediately.
"Often they will keep you on the phone for the entire process, walk you down to the supermarket, wait while you get the cards and then get you to read the numbers back," she said.
"I think the main group we see falling victim to this are the over-65s, and on the whole they're not too familiar with iTunes gift cards unless they buy them for grandkids."
The ACCC is now working with sellers of iTunes gift cards to report bulk purchases that might look suspicious.

Up to a third of Australian mortgages could be "liar loans" based on factually inaccurate information, investment bank UBS has warned.

The global banking giant has followed up a survey of home loan borrowers that it first conducted last year, when it found evidence of widespread mortgage fraud.
The latest detailed survey of more than 900 people who took out a home loan in 2017 has found that only 67 per cent responded that their mortgage was "completely factual and accurate", down from 72 per cent of 2016 borrowers.
The vast majority of the mistruths appear to be white lies rather than total porkies, with a quarter of 2017 survey respondents saying their loan application was "mostly factual and accurate". Only 8 per cent admitted to their information being only "partially factual and accurate", and 1 per cent refused to say.
If anything, UBS believes its survey would understate the prevalence of mortgage misrepresentations as some people would be nervous about admitting it, even anonymously.
"It is highly unlikely respondents would have stated that they misrepresented their mortgage application when in fact they were truthful," the bank noted in the report.
Given the average turnover of home loans in Australia, UBS has estimated that around $500 billion worth of outstanding home loans contain misstatements about incomes, assets, existing debts and/or expenses.
With just under $1.7 trillion of mortgage debt outstanding, that means home loans based on inaccurate or fraudulent information account for 29 per cent of the total, and 18 per cent of all private sector debt in Australia.
The most common lie was understating living costs (30 per cent), while understating other debts or overstating income or assets each accounted for around 15 per cent of misrepresentations.
Given that the average scale of the misstatement across income, expenses, assets and living expenses was between 10-12 per cent, UBS has warned that it makes Australia's banks even more vulnerable to a housing downturn than most people think.

"This survey suggests many people have come to take house price inflation as a given and are prepared to be factually inaccurate on their mortgage application to ensure they get access to housing leverage," UBS warned in the report.
The investment bank has an "underweight", or sell, rating on Australian banks and has warned that loan losses may be bigger than expected given that many borrowers are in a much weaker financial position than the banks and regulators believe.
That would lead to even worse consequences for the Australian economy than policymakers expect if the housing market turns down.
UBS also warned that the banks may be vulnerable to litigation if home prices stop rising and over-indebted customers start defaulting.
It argued that more needs to be done by the banks to verify loan applications, starting with a requirement to see lodged tax returns.
This year, UBS also broke down its numbers by financial institution.

ANZ Bank had the highest proportion of mortgages that were not "completely factual and accurate", with 45 per cent falling into the investment bank's category of "liar loans", a term borrowed from the US subprime mortgage crisis.
That was significantly above the industry average of 33 per cent, as was NAB's level of loan approvals that contained misrepresentations or inaccuracies.
"A survey of 907 people covering all of the major banks is an extremely limited sample given ANZ has more than 1 million home loans," an ANZ spokesperson said, in response to UBS's findings.
"We have processes in place designed to ensure our home loans continue to be assessed conservatively.
"This includes applying an interest rate floor of 7.25 per cent and using the higher of either the customer-stated expenses or a benchmark based on independent data provided by the Melbourne Institute.
"The survey reinforces the need for the introduction of Comprehensive Credit Reporting which ANZ strongly supports."
ANZ's chief executive Shayne Elliott told investors at its most recent quarterly profit update that it was growing owner-occupied lending "much faster than the market" and was "really comfortable with that".
All four major banks recorded a much higher level of dodgy mortgage approvals than the rest of the financial sector (at 23 per cent).

Loans taken out through brokers had a much higher rate of misrepresentation than those who applied directly through a bank (39 per cent less than wholly truthful, versus 25 per cent).

Worryingly, 37 per cent of borrowers who got their loan through a broker and lied on the application said it was at the broker's suggestion — only 8 per cent of bank customers said it was a banker who suggested lying.
Also concerning for regulators would be the 46 per cent of customers who thought their latest loan application was easier than previous ones, versus only 17 per cent who thought it was harder.
The bank regulator APRA has asked banks to tighten their loan tests to ensure financial stability, but the survey shows that loan verification practices appear to be virtually unchanged in terms of documentation required.
"We found these responses disappointing," UBS lamented.
"We believe there is little evidence to suggest customers are finding it more difficult to attain credit or that mortgage underwriting standards are being tightened from a customer's perspective."
UBS also broke down its numbers by state. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the nation's two most expensive property markets, New South Wales and Victoria, were also the ones with the highest rate of less-than-honest mortgage applications.
A third of New South Wales and ACT borrowers fudged at least some figures on their loan application, while 31 per cent of Victorians and Tasmanians did likewise.
Western Australia had the same rate of inaccuracy as Victoria, while around three-quarters of South Australians, Queenslanders and Northern Territorians were totally honest in their loan documents.


A Singapore-based developer has been accused of giving Sydney a "two-fingered salute" by demolishing much of the historic facade of an inner-city building in order to construct an apartment block.
The $21 million project will see three amalgamated 1912 Edwardian terraces in Potts Point replaced by a modern eight-storey tower.
The City of Sydney approved the demolition of the existing Hensley Hall building, with the exception of the Bayswater Road facade.

But the recent removal of hoardings shows most of the facade had been removed, leaving two thin gables rising up on each end of the 25-metre frontage.
The City of Sydney confirmed in a statement that some elements of the facade that were to be retained have been removed.
"The City is currently investigating the unauthorised removal and considering the heritage impact of the work undertaken."
Potts Point and Kings Cross Heritage and Residents Society president Andrew Woodhouse said he believed the facade was demolished about 18 months ago, however it was hidden behind hoarding.
"We had assumed that what was happening was in accordance with the development consent," he said.

He said he and other local residents discovered that the heritage facade had been largely demolished when the hording was taken down about 10 days ago.
He said workers began putting back up the hoarding over the weekend.
"There is now two gables left facing Bayswater Road and they appear to be two fingers sticking up, and that's symbolic of the developer giving the two-finger salute to the community over our heritage," he said.
The 930 square metre site is not a heritage item but is a contributory item within the Potts Point Conservation Area.
Over the years it operated as a private hotel and boarding house. Well-known local busker and collector Barry Minhinnick was evicted after 20 years living in the building and acting as its caretaker.
The garden he created out of found objects on the corner of Ward Avenue and Bayswater Road featured in newspapers, magazines and on ABC TV's Gardening Australia.

Mr Woodhouse has written to the council claiming the demolition was "wilful, negligent and/or deliberate".
He has asked the council to fine the developer or commence legal action as well as ordering the facade be reinstated at the developer's expense.
The developer, Roxy-Pacific, has been contacted for comment.


The economic arguments being used by mining giant Glencore in its application to keep expanding its controversial McArthur River Mine are "almost comical" according to a report by think tank the Australia Institute.
Both the Northern Territory and Federal Governments are considering the company's Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) application for the mine in the Gulf of Carpentaria to keep producing zinc and lead for another 30 years.
Glencore was ordered to submit the EIS in 2014 after reactive rock on its waste dump started burning, sending smoke over nearby Indigenous communities.
In the EIS Glencore said: "This project estimates significant benefits arising from the approved mine life, with taxes and royalties exceeding $1.5 billion over the four phases, jobs for approximately 840 people, and continuing community investment through the … Community Benefits Trust."
But a report by the Canberra-based Australia Institute, Wishful Zinking, has raised multiple questions about the company's argument that the financial benefits offered by the project outweigh the environmental risks.

"The modelling and economic analysis in these EIS documents … are based on assumptions that are, at times, almost comical," the report said.
"Based on the company's analysis, it's very unclear how you could come to a conclusion that the McArthur River Mine is even a net positive to the Northern Territory economy," report author Rod Campbell told the ABC.
Glencore estimates the mine will pay a total of $435 million in royalties to the NT Government over 1,000 years.
Mr Campbell said this figure was unrealistic because, "In most years, Glencore doesn't pay royalties for McArthur River Mine at all".
This is because the NT has a profits-based, rather than production-based, royalties system, unlike most other states.

"The only known royalty payment of $13 million came in 2008 after a historic peak in the zinc price," the report said.
The EIS estimated Glencore would pay $1.035 billion in company tax to the Federal Government.
The Australia Institute assessed this as unlikely because, "It is known that the company often pays zero in company tax".
"ATO data shows that despite $108,107,933 in taxable income, Glencore entities paid no company tax in 2014-15," the report said.
The EIS estimated the company's payroll tax would be $117.4 million over 1,000 years, even though for the last 945 years of the project only four employees were expected to be needed to monitor the site.
"It's comical. Economists don't like to forecast anything over 20 years at the most," Mr Campbell said.
"Here we've got tax revenues forecast over 1,000 years. This is unprecedented."
On jobs, the report said: "Glencore estimates that only 4 per cent of the mine's workforce will be local people. Others will be fly-in, fly-out."
The company estimated it would put $27 million into its Community Benefits Trust and provide, "generous contributions to local health, education, cultural and capacity building initiatives, and the funding of vital public services".
"There is no doubt the trust has helped upgrade the local store, with fencing and provided machinery to local businesses," Mr Campbell said.
"But the local area's vital health and education services are funded almost entirely by government."
The report also pointed out that in its EIS, Glencore suggested there may need to be government funding to keep managing the site for the project's last 945 years.
"The economic assessment is wilfully myopic in terms of potential environmental costs, and makes no attempt to weigh that up in dollar figure terms in relation to any potential economic benefits," Mr Campbell said.

"From an economic perspective, it is likely that the best approach would be to close the mine and rehabilitate the site and to ensure this is paid for by Glencore," the report concluded.
However, the economic implications of the project could change before the two governments make their decision on the EIS.
The NT Government is considering changing its royalty system to include a production-based element, which could collect more money from the mine.
"The first thing we need to do is consult and talk to the right people and that's what we'll continue to do before any decision's made, but any decision will not be made without input from the industry," NT Resources Minister Ken Vowles said.
Glencore responded by providing a statement to the ABC saying it, "had no participation in the Australia Institute's report".
The company added: "It should be noted that the economic forecasts in our draft EIS have been calculated using a wide range of factors by an independent and respected consulting firm."


Governments could be making the nation's energy security crisis worse through rushed interventions to soothe voter concerns about surging energy bills, the Grattan Institute warns.
The warning comes as the Prime Minister prepares to meet AGL chief executive Andy Vesey today over the planned closure of the Liddell power station in the NSW Hunter Valley by 2022.
The Grattan Institute's Tony Wood urged against the Government "arm twisting" Mr Vesey to keep Liddell open in the face of the company's commitment to eventually dump coal-fired power generation entirely.
"I think there's almost certainly a deal to be done there, but I think AGL would have a very strong view that their corporate position and their advertising says they're getting out of coal," Mr Wood said.

"It's quite possible that a commercial arrangement that suits AGL and satisfies the concerns the Government has is the way forward. But it's going to be a tricky pathway to follow."
Treasurer Scott Morrison said he was prepared to help AGL sell Liddell to a "responsible party" but repeated the importance of keeping it open to ensure future power supplies.
But Mr Wood counselled against any plan for the Government to intervene and possibly buy a guarantee to keep Liddell open, warning any perception of nationalisation would destabilise the market.
"I think it is always a bad idea for governments to intervene because then we're heading back towards re-nationalisation," he said.
"It is understandable that governments feel the need to do something, but the danger is they will rush in and make things worse. What Australia needs now is perspective, not panic."
Instead, the Grattan Institute report said all sides of politics should work with energy companies and regulators on new ways to ensure reliable and affordable electricity supplies years ahead.
It suggests work needs to begin now on a "capacity mechanism" to encourage companies to invest in new power generation to reduce the growing threat of shortages and blackouts as early as this summer.

With such a mechanism, according to the report, energy companies could be paid for committing to providing power years into the future rather than only meeting the current demand.
However, the report warns the price of peace of mind for energy security would ultimately fall on consumers through higher energy prices.
"Eventually the customer pays for all of this. That's why it's very important to get this right to ensure we have the insurance we need to make sure we have the capacity in the future," Mr Wood said.
Last week, the Australian Energy Market Operator urged "a longer-term approach" in a bid to ensure electricity supplies.
The Grattan Institute report urged the Government to implement the recommendations of the Finkel Review, including a clean energy target to put a price on greenhouse gas emissions.
It also wants a more comprehensive assessment of future energy adequacy of generated supply and if capacity cannot be met, AEMO should introduce a new capacity mechanism.

An operation has resumed this morning to rescue a humpback whale caught in a cray pot rope off the coast of Western Australia.
Authorities were alerted to the plight of the eight-metre whale after a call from a member of the public about 11am on Sunday.
Fremantle Sea Rescue skipper Josh Gammon-Carson said the whale was trapped in what appeared to be a cray pot or octopus pot rope.
"It was swimming around in circles and looked in distress," Mr Gammon-Carson said.
"It had a rope wrapped around its body in front of its fin and another one through its mouth."
For more than seven hours, 13 officers from Parks and Wildlife and the Fremantle Sea Rescue were on the water, "trying different techniques to try and slow down the whale to cut free the ropes".
Rescuers followed the humpback whale to Trigg, but the rescue was suspended just before 6:00pm due to fading light.
The whale has not been spotted today.
Parks and Wildlife senior marine officer John Edwards said it was important they found the whale.
"The animal's in that 8-10 metre range, so it has still got a lot of growing to do, and the rope won't grow with it," Mr Edwards said.
"So unless it parts and falls off or we're able to get to it and cut it off, the long-term prognosis for the animal is not as good as we'd hope."
Whales are commonly known to migrate along the coast of WA in September travelling towards Antarctica for summer.
"This time of year is fantastic for whale watching, but unfortunately we do get incidents like this," Mr Gammon-Carson said.
The skipper said it was important other people on the water were cautious around the animals and gave the emergency vessels space to help them.
"Have a look at the whales, but do remain clear. It is against the law to drive a boat within 100 metres of a whale," he said.
"If you do see a whale in distress contact Fremantle Sea Rescue or the Department of Parks and Wildlife directly, we can assist."



North Korea has business interests in parts of Asia, Africa, the Middle East and even Europe that bring in billions of dollars for the regime, despite international sanctions aimed at curbing the country's nuclear program.

An investigation that will air on Four Corners has revealed how these international businesses help fund the lavish lifestyles of leader Kim Jong-un and those close to him.
Former members of the regime and intelligence officers have described how Kim's so-called "royal economy" works.
"Many have the view that North Korea's actually extremely, extremely isolated from the international community, that it doesn't have trade relations with the outside world, bar China, but the truth couldn't be further from that," defence analyst Andrea Berger said.
"North Korea is very sophisticated in concealing the fact that it is, indeed, North Korea doing business overseas. It's good at hiding in plain sight."

North Korea has a mysterious government department, known as Office 39, that operates as a kind of royal slush fund.
"On paper Office 39 is just another department in the Korean Workers Party, but in practice Office 39 is the ultimate slush fund," Ms Berger said.
"It mixes both illicit and licit activity and creates that kind of support internally in North Korea to keep the leadership and the elite happy."
Office 39 is thought to bring in up to $1.6 billion a year for the Kim family.
Earlier this year, the assassination of Kim Jong-un's half brother, Kim Jong-nam, at Kuala Lumpur airport with the chemical agent VX, revealed a frightening new capacity for the dictator.
"Chemical agents, in general, used in a military context can be loaded into bombs, mines, mortars, that type of thing," Hugh Gregg, from the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, said.

"All chemical agents could kill huge numbers of people if it's delivered effectively for their purposes."
The assassination also exposed how deep the regime's operations in Malaysia ran.
"Malaysia was regarded as a kind of window for North Korea to go abroad because Malaysia is a visa-free country for North Korea," the former North Korean deputy ambassador to the UK, Thae Yong-Ho, said.
"It was a kind of paradise for North Korea to expand their business."

It emerged that there had been more than 1,000 North Koreans living and working in Malaysia.
Many worked on road building and other development projects, but Ms Berger said North Korea also ran a military communications company called Glocom out of Malaysia.
"Glocom was a network selling military communications out of Malaysia, marketing arms and related material overseas, pretending to be a Malaysian arms manufacturer but, indeed, was behind the scenes in North Korea, selling its technology to parts of Africa, the Middle East and potentially South East Asia," she said.

Ms Berger said North Korea's business activity stretches as far as Europe.
"North Korea's national insurance company was able to operate in the UK," she said.
"It's not believed that North Korea has strong links in the conventional sense to the United States, but we have seen that North Korea is able to access products from the United States of America.

"Kim Jong-un's motorcade was armoured in the United States and then re-exported to North Korea without, seemingly, the knowledge of US Customs authorities."
Kim Kwang-Jin, a former North Korean finance worker in Singapore, said the insurance company he worked for sent money directly to the Dear Leader.
"That is Kim family economy. They are making foreign cash from these businesses," he said.
"We make money and withdraw $US20 million cash every year for Kim Jong-il's birthday. So we keep them, count them and put them in 20 boxes, $US1 million each.
"It was regarded as one of the best, profitable organisations in North Korea, in Pyongyang. And we benefit, you know, enjoyed benefit for that."

Despite the international community announcing tougher economic sanctions to address Kim Jong-un's nuclear program, the regime's businesses have continued to operate overseas.
"I would say that UN sanctions on North Korea are like an expanding sieve. No single one of the sanctions measures that have been put in place against North Korea at the UN level enjoys robust global implementation," Ms Berger said.
"If China systemically implemented the sanctions at the UN that it has agreed to that would be a huge step forward but, actually, it's not just China that's important here.
"There's so many countries around the world that have those North Korean business communities, that have those political ties still to North Korea that aren't using the leverage that they too have."

Tasmania's environmental watchdog will monitor emissions from bunker fuel from cruise ships while they are in port.
A record number of cruise ships will dock at Tasmanian ports this summer, raising environmental concerns and causing division within the tourism industry.

The number of cruise ships has more than doubled in two years and 138 ships are scheduled to visit Hobart's Macquarie Wharf, Burnie, Port Arthur and Wineglass Bay, starting next month.
Some of those ships will burn bunker fuel at port, a cheap low-grade fuel that emits sulphur dioxide.
For the first time, the Environment Protection Authority (EPA) will monitor air quality around Hobart's port to detect if cruise ships are polluting at harmful levels.
The air will be tested every 10 minutes from equipment set up near the CSIRO.
EPA director Wes Ford said he would be taking cruise ship companies to task if ships were burning the fuel unnecessarily.
"The point of the monitoring is to see if we can get a signal from the cruise ships being here and whether we can actually detect the level of sulphur dioxide emissions," Mr Ford said.
"It will also give the community a level of confidence that those emissions are within the national standards."
Hobart City Council Greens Alderman Helen Burnet wanted authorities to go even further and follow Sydney in banning low-grade fuel from being burnt when at port in Hobart.

Alderman Burnett said she would be pushing the council to write to the State and Federal governments calling for a ban.
"Sydney's ban was a result of political pressure, and it's high time we saw the same sort of standards for Hobart," she said.
"We need to see a reduction in the emissions of cruise ship fuels."
Mr Ford said he didn't see the need for a ban yet.
"I think the number of cruise ships that are coming to Hobart are significantly lower than Sydney, but we'll soon find out over this summer what the level of emissions are," he said.
Tourism Industry Council Tasmania chief executive Luke Martin said there was a risk Tasmania could lose control of the rapidly growing cruise ship industry.
"We certainly don't want to go down a path where the perception of doing Tasmania by cruise becomes the norm, because it's not how the industry is structured and not how the industry wants to grow," Mr Martin said.
"If we don't get a hold of it, we're going to quickly lose control.

"There's a real risk we can lose control of a sector of the market that's growing of its own accord, and is inconsistent with the rest of the destination."
Mr Martin said cruise ships represented 25 per cent of the state's visitor numbers, but made up only 1 per cent of tourism spending.
Destination Southern Tasmania chief executive Melinda Anderson said cruise ship visitors gave a well-needed boost to regional areas like Burnie and Port Arthur.
She said they also brought additional visitors to Hobart when hotels were already full, spending almost $200 each on average.
"Whilst they might only be here a short time, they are actually spreading around the region, so we see the cruise sector as a way of introducing visitors to Tasmania and encouraging them to come back," she said.
Ms Anderson said cruise visitors brought $25 million to the state last year and there was a need to strategically plan for cruise ship growth.



Victoria's central highlands are essential to protecting Melbourne's water supply and also contributing $260 million a year to the tourism economy, a new study has found.
The report from the Australian National University (ANU) used an international method recognised by the United Nations to value the ecosystem in the central highlands — an area that spreads north and east of Healesville.
The study estimates the central highlands add $310 million of economic value to the state's water supply and $260 million to tourism, while the controversial native logging industry is worth just $12 million.
A study by Deloitte for the state-owned VicForests last year found native logging and processing helped generate more than $500 million for the state's economy supporting more than 2,000 jobs.
VicForests says the new ANU report does not factor in the value of timber products and processing.
Environmentalists and local tourism operators want much of the area turned into the Great Forest National Park.
They plan to lobby for the national park during next year's state election campaign.
The potential national park is also likely to be an issue in the upcoming Northcote byelection in inner Melbourne, where Labor and the Greens will go head to head.

The central highlands are home to mountain ash trees which have been logged for hardwood production.
It is also the catchment for the majority of Melbourne Water's 10 water storage reservoirs.
VicForests admitted the native hardwood supply is dwindling, a key reason the Heyfield mill in Gippsland decided to close.
The Andrews Government has since moved to buy the ailing business.
Opponents of native timber logging, much of which is used as pulp for paper, said the industry could be supplied with plantation timber, something many in industry acknowledge but argue that transition takes time.
The study said that moving away from harvesting of native forest would contribute to improved "economic, social and environmental benefits for the people of Victoria."
"The net value of ecosystem services would increase if native forest logging were phased out, due to improved ecosystem condition in older forests that continued growing,'' the report said.
By stopping logging, the water catchment would be improved and would maximise "water yield and quality" and increase the amount of water available to Melbourne, it found.
But VicForests chief executive Nathan Trushell said the report substantially downplayed the value of the timber industry.
"The key issue is that the ANU report has only calculated the value add of timber in the forest, rather than the impressive domestic value add from processing and downstream manufacturing to produce high quality timber products,'' he said.
"This is akin to only calculating the value of grape growing for the wine industry while ignoring the substantial value add of producing high quality wine".
VicForests said only 6 per cent of forest in Victoria was available and suitable for native timber harvesting, while more than 70 per cent was located in National Parks and reserve systems.
One of the ANU report's authors David Lindenmayer said old forests were critical to water security.
"A young regenerating forest after logging soaks up most of the water, dries out the water catchments, reduces the amount of water that flows into the dams for the city of Melbourne but also what it does, quite critically, is it increases the risk of the forest burning at much high severity,' he said.

Tourism is a major employer in the region and the report said it would be boosted by ending logging.
Local tourism operators want the attractions to be better recognised and supported by government.
They say a national park would boost domestic and international tourism with some of the world's oldest trees and forests in the region.
Wine growers, including Stephen Powell in the Yarra Valley, also supported the protection of the forests because he said the trees act as an air conditioner for the region during summer by cooling the air that flows into the valley, helping to contribute to the region's terroir.
"It is a really important part of creating the diversity that is the Yarra Valley.'

Strathvea Guest House manager Deanne Eccles said hospitality would also benefit from an end to logging.
"They always ask us about the forest, they ask us about Black Saturday fires, but they also ask about the forest and the future of the forest,'' Ms Eccles said.
"Then when they see it being destroyed and we say that government are doing this they are amazed, they can't believe we are destroying our tourist product."
Environment minister Lily D'Ambrosio said the central highlands were a complex issue and a special taskforce had been working on a solution.
She also said that a national park was a consideration.
"We will come up with the solutions that will ensure that we can protect what is of great value to our community in terms of our wonderful native forests but also of course have a clear eye on the need to look after jobs," Ms D'Ambrosio said.


It may come as a surprise, but there is affordable housing in Melbourne. Even in the inner city.
Less surprising: There is not enough of it.
Now, some Melbourne councils are trying to use their power over zoning to push developers into setting aside more homes for affordable housing.
But their leverage over developers is limited, a situation Hobsons Bay Mayor Sandra Wilson calls "frustrating".

Developer Guy Nelson concedes that the "whole definition of affordable housing is a little grey".
Affordable housing is not the same as public housing.
Apartments are owned by private investors or non-profit housing agencies.
Janie Miller's East Coburg flat costs $250 a week for what she calls her "gorgeous little cubby house".
Her private landlord gets full rent which is subsidised by the Commonwealth by up to 20 per cent.
It gives her and many others on relatively low incomes a place they can afford in Melbourne's often stratospherically expensive market.
If she was charged the full market rate, she could not stay here — in familiar surrounds, and where her adult children live.
"The thought of having to go another 10, 20 kilometres out just to live is really painful," Ms Miller said.

When the Yarra Council rezoned the old Alphington paper mill site, it asked developers to set aside 5 per cent of homes in the project for affordable housing.
Guy Nelson from developer Alpha Partners agreed and is providing 150 units out of the 2,500 being built.
"150 apartments would be something like $90 million worth of value," Mr Nelson said.
But it is not quite what it seems.
Of those 150 units, only 10 are actually being given away.
The other 140 are being leased for 10 years to a non-profit agency, Community Housing Limited.
When those 10 years are up, the developer can then take the units back and sell them on the open market.
Guy Nelson said giving all 150 units away to Community Housing was never considered.
"I think it's crazy economics and no-one would do it," he said.
But Michael Perusco, from non-profit agency Unison Community Housing, said developers make a lot of money from being issued with a planning permit, and that forcing them to surrender a portion of their properties is a fair trade for development approval.
"It makes sense when you're in the midst of a housing affordability crisis to ensure that yes, the developer makes a reasonable profit, but also that you get some public good," Mr Perusco said.
Community Housing Limited's managing director Steve Bevington said the deal with Alpha Partners is the best that can be achieved because there are no other options.
"It depends very much on the individual developer and the individual council," Mr Bevington said.
"In other countries like the UK, there are schemes that have 40 per cent affordable housing."

Other councils are also trying to push developers to provide affordable housing.
Hobsons Bay Council plans to rezone a 67-hectare industrial site at Altona North, providing enough land for 3,000 homes.
In return, it wants at least five per cent of those homes set aside for affordable housing.
Mayor Sandra Wilson would have personally liked 10 per cent but doubts that would be achievable.
So why can't the council — with power over zoning laws — put its foot down?
"We don't have all the power that we would like, because some of the decisions that we make can be challenged at VCAT," Ms Wilson said.
"It's frustrating."
Steve Bevington from Community Housing thinks five per cent is reasonable as a general consideration, but says government incentives could boost the figure to more like 15 per cent - if it used the windfall revenues from Melbourne's property boom.
"There needs to be an overall state-wide policy so developers can price affordable housing developments into their projects," Mr Bevington said.
Victoria's Planning Minister Richard Wynne is not backing the idea of an across-the-board scheme, but said legislation already before parliament, will give councils greater powers to enforce an agreement.
"It's not our intention to go to a mandatory minimum, but certainly there is a very strong appetite we believe for developers and councils to actually join together."
And they will need to get building quickly. The organisation Affordable Development Outcomes last year estimated up to 100,000 Victorians need a cheaper place to live.

With Melbourne's median house price at more than $800,000, buyers' advocate Catherine Cashmore warns affordable housing policies are only tinkering around the edges of a much bigger problem.
The latest analysis by her organisation, Prosper Australia, shows the seven largest developers on the Australian stock exchange hold 15 years' worth of land supply - which they are drip-feeding onto the market to keep prices high.
She has reiterated her call for a major shake-up of the taxation system to remove the generous incentives for investing in housing.
"We breastfed a nation on the notion that the way you grow wealthy is to invest in land and to sit on it and allow the price to go upwards, that does nothing for housing affordability," Ms Cashmore said.
She argues an annual land tax would discourage investors from hoarding land or keeping properties vacant.
"You can't blame the investors, you can't blame the developers, they're doing what they are dictated to do by the tax system and by government policy."


Wall Street battened down the hatches on Friday as Hurricane Irma swept up towards Florida and North Korea prepared some industrial scale fireworks for the 69th anniversary of Kim family domination.
The S&P500 edged down a tad, while the Nasdaq had a rougher time as Apple and Facebook were sold off.

The blue chip Dow Jones rose marginally, oddly enough hauled up by a solid gain in insurance stocks, even though a series of brutal hurricanes were building up in the Atlantic.
Buying straw hats in winter is one thing, but insurance shares in the face an increasingly regular "one-in-a-hundred-year" hurricanes, while nuclear warheads are primed on the other side of the planet, seems counter-cyclical in the extreme.
Markets were expecting — but not overly fussed about — another North Korean nuclear test to mark the nation's Foundation Day. It generally lets one rip on special days, such as July 4 as a gift to the US.
However, the latest offer to broker a peace between North Korea and the US by the only person on the planet who could lay a claim to being a "bestie" with both Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un was more unexpected.
The intervention by the entirely odd, former professional basketballer Dennis Rodman was unlikely to be any less effective than the collective diplomatic might of the UN, and weird just might work. It is that sort of world.
The market may recall Rodman's former teammate Michael Jordan teaming up with Bugs Bunny in Space Jam to save the world 20 years ago, and think "Hell yeah, genius" — problem solved and plough in with ears pinned back.
Alternatively in a saner, not loading up on insurance shares ahead of Florida being wiped out moment, traders may wearily think, "Is this really where we're at?" and sell.
Despite all that, Wall Street managed a reasonable 0.4 per cent gain over the week, Europe and China were flattish and ASX's 0.9 per cent loss was only exceeded by a 2 per cent retreat in Japan after a missile sailed overhead.
One of the peculiarities of the Australian economy will be on display again this week — buoyant business sentiment and very glum customers.
The NAB publishes its respected business confidence and conditions surveys on Tuesday. Both measures improved in July and both are well above their long term average.
Westpac, in collaboration with the Melbourne Institute, released its monthly survey of consumer sentiment. It fell again last month to be around 5 per cent below its long term average.
For the best part of three years, consumer pessimism has outweighed optimism and this month should be no different.

The numbers tallied up in the second quarter national accounts supported the divergence evident in NAB and Westpac surveys.
Business sales and profits are picking up, and even investment intentions are becoming more positive. On the other hand, real disposable income has not risen since the GFC and household savings are shrinking.
So what makes business so chipper when the downtrodden consumer underwrites around 60 per cent of the economy?
Minack Advisors' Gerard Minack said the disparity was easy to explain; business sales and profits were driven by aggregate activity, while consumer sentiment was tied to per person income and spending.
The bullish business feeling has not translated into a robust economy, but there are now seeds of optimism, according to Mr Minack.
"While it's not news that Australian business is more upbeat than consumers, what is new is the hint that corporates are acting on that sentiment," he said.
The important drivers in the economy — investment, hiring and wage payments — are picking up.
Mr Minack noted the most surprising development of the three was wages, with NAB survey finding wage costs were rising, although official data indicates they were not.
He argued the degree of slackness in the labour market suggested the official data was broadly accurate.

"While an improvement in investment remains a forecast, not so for employment," Mr Minack said.
"Hiring intentions from the monthly business surveys are at all-time highs [starting 2002].
Further evidence of that is expected this week when the Australian Bureau of Statistics trots August jobs numbers on Thursday.
The consensus forecast is for another 20,000 new jobs and unemployment staying put at 5.6 per cent.
Mr Minack said his base case for the economy remained one of ongoing anaemic nominal growth.
"However, the improvement in corporate indicators suggests that the risks are becoming more balanced. The base case outlook would brighten if wage growth accelerates."
That remains a substantial "if".
There is not much else on the calendar, although AGM season gets underway as does the September quarter production results in the resources sector.
Overseas is very quiet — bar the substantial monthly data dump in China on Thursday.
Readings of industrial production, retail sales and the proxy for infrastructure spending — fixed asset investment — are all expected to be broadly stable.

The Northern Territory Police will not investigate a complaint related to the NT's new bottle shop laws that have stopped liquor giant Dan Murphy's from coming to Darwin.
In Parliament last month, Independent MLA Robyn Lambley questioned if political donations from the hotels industry had influenced Labor's new policy limiting the floor size of bottle shops, which has blocked a new store proposal from Dan Murphy's.
She then referred the matter to police.
But on Saturday, NT Police spokesman Scott Howard said police had decided there would not be a formal inquiry.
He did not provide an explanation for the decision.
"The assessment of this matter is now complete," he said.
"Police will not be commencing a formal investigation. The matter is now finalised and all parties have been advised."
Ms Lambley said she was extremely disappointed with the decision.
"They told me that they had not interviewed anyone in regards to the allegations I'd made, and that they had not collected any extra information," she said.
"They said that they had reviewed my referral, which was a substantial referral approximately 50 pages, and that they had sought legal advice, and the legal advice indicated to them there was no case to answer and therefore they had no intention of investigating the matter, the matter was closed."

Mrs Lambley said the NT Chief Minister Michael Gunner should have stood aside as Police Minister while police assessed her complaint.
Last Wednesday, Mr Gunner said he would step aside as minister only if police decided to hold a formal investigation.
"My understanding is no investigation has commenced," Mr Gunner said.
"If they choose to investigate then I will step down."
The NT Government has been under pressure over its laws limiting the public browsing area of bottle shops to 400 square metres.
The ABC has revealed that the government's floor size legislation is almost identical to a policy proposal sent by the NT branch of the Australian Hotels Association (AHA NT) in April last year to then Opposition Leader Michael Gunner.
Michael Gunner said Labor had come up with the policy itself and it was a coincidence the AHA NT proposal closely mirrored the NT Government legislation.
The NT Government has consistently denied any link between donations and its floor size policy.


Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has called for the NT Labor Government to lift its moratorium on fracking.
Speaking at the Country Liberals annual conference in Darwin on Saturday, Mr Turnbull said the NT Government, led by Chief Minister Michael Gunner, was at risk of squandering the Territory's "immense" resource opportunities.
"My message to Michael Gunner is: pull the trigger, get on with it," Mr Turnbull said.
"The jobs, the investment, the opportunities that come with opening up 180 years of gas that you're sitting on is endless."
The NT Labor Government has put a 12-month moratorium on fracking while a fracking inquiry takes place.
"The answer is good engagement backed by science, not blanket bans," Mr Turnbull said.
The Prime Minister used his speech to continue his attack on Labor and federal Opposition Leader Bill Shorten over energy policy.
"The incompetence of the Labor Party in energy over a long period of time is hard to believe," he said.
"I mean, Blackout Bill, fair dinkum, as my old dad would have said, he is so hopeless he could not find his backside with both hands."
Mr Shorten said Australians have had a "gutful" of Mr Turnbull "blaming everyone else".
"He's the Prime Minister — he has the power to fix this," Mr Shorten said in a statement.
"If I was prime minister right now, I would make sure more gas stays in Australia at lower prices.
"I would end the war on renewables and implement a clean energy target, and I'd prepare a strategic energy reserve to stop the blackouts this summer."
Mr Turnbull was in Darwin to rally the Country Liberals who are attempting to rebuild their party after losing all but two seats in last year's election wipeout.
"As the Territory's only truly grassroots political movement, I am very confident the CLP will be back bigger and better than ever in three years' time," Mr Turnbull said.
A review of the CLP's election defeat says the party has a "long march" back into office.
The report, by former Federal Liberal party president Brian Loughnane and former Nationals president Scott Mitchell, found "significant problems" with the Country Liberals' 2016 campaign and a "dysfunctional" party and government in the four years leading up to the election.
The CLP's term from 2012-2016 was plagued by scandal and division and the review highlights one submission that detailed a "chronology of destruction" during those years.
"There were sexual misadventures, allegations of corruption, an expressed want of confidence in the NT police, slurs against colleagues and staff, defections, perceived conflicts of interest, a failed clumsy attempt to dislodge Adam Giles as chief minister capped by the Don Dale controversy," the review said.

The report revealed that while the Country Liberals were in office, instead of an increase in membership, there was a "collapse", with almost half the party's annually renewing members leaving.
It also shows the party failed to raise enough funds to fight the 2016 campaign, despite assurances from the party leadership that there was a $1 million campaign war chest.
"The debt by the end of August 2016 in itself was enough to take out the Country Liberals who had a near death experience electorally, financially and membership-wise," the review said.
This weekend, the Country Liberals will decide whether to accept some or all of the 38 recommendations of the review.
One of the most controversial recommendations is that members of the former CLP government who lost their seats last year be "actively discouraged" from seeking preselection again.
Party President Shane Stone was re-elected unopposed for another year in the role.


The South Australian Government has again delayed its Energy Security Target, a key plank of its $550 million energy plan.
The start of the Energy Security Target – originally planned to take effect in July – has been delayed for a second time, in this case until 2020.
It will operate in a similar way to the Federal Government's Renewable Energy Target (RET), with a major difference.
Instead of incentivising new renewable projects, it will require retailers to source 36 per cent of the state's electricity needs from gas generators and other synchronous power sources.
The Government today wrote to stakeholders advising of a further delay.
"The revised commencement date of 1 January 2020 allows retailers more time to consider the most efficient options for incorporating the Energy Security Target requirements in their business," it said.
"[It will give] investors a greater opportunity to work out how best to supply the market with a wider range of solutions.
"Commissioning of new generation projects in South Australia will provide a more competitive environment and, coupled with more lead time for market participants, the costs of the scheme will be lower, improving the price outcomes for South Australian consumers while delivering improved security."
The scheme was designed to help stabilise the state's energy grid with more sources of firm generation, and boost competition in the wholesale market.
But its introduction was delayed until January 2018 after power users and energy companies — including battery giant Tesla — criticised the Government's proposal.
The revised date also responds to recent changes in the energy market.
Since the consultation on the draft EST regulations, the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) has required an increased number of large synchronous generating units to remain online, to provide adequate system strength.
Earlier this week, AEMO warned South Australia was at risk of blackouts this summer without the energy plan.
Temporary generators and the Tesla battery are due to be installed by December, and a new solar thermal plant at Port Augusta will eventually follow.


Free to a good home — one 1981 disused commuter plane.
It's a renovators delight, in need of a little love and attention.
The Shorts 330 plane has been sitting at Alice Springs Airport for decades after it was bought by charter company Charter Air to sell for spare parts.
Head of Charter Air Douglas Hendry said the airport's management told him it needed to go, so he advertised it online.
"I put it on Gumtree on Thursday and it's just gone absolutely viral since I put it up there," he said.
"I had a phone call yesterday from a lady in Darwin who makes pies and she wants to turn it into a pie shop and call it pie in the sky.

"I had another guy from Sydney call me this morning, he's got a putt-putt golf (course) in Sydney and he wants this as the centrepiece of his putt putt golf."
Mr Hendry said he had been overwhelmed by people's creativity.
"It's just amazing, the ideas these people are coming up with I would never have thought about them in a million years," he said.
Mr Hendry said it was unlikely the plane would every return to the skies.
"If you had a spare million bucks you could probably get it flying again," he said.

"It'll never fly, but the good thing about it being here in Alice Springs is it doesn't have an ounce of corrosion on it."
The Shorts 330 ceased production in 1992, and about 136 were built.
A military variant is still used around the world, often as a launch vehicle for paratroopers.


Broken Hill in far west New South Wales has welcomed the most fabulous train to arrive on its platform yet.
Three carriages full of drag queens and fans of drag culture made their way from Sydney on Thursday for the city's annual Broken Heel festival this weekend, through to Sunday.
The 14-hour journey made stops at Strathfield, Parramatta, Katoomba, Lithgow, Bathurst, Orange and Parkes.
The festival started three years ago, celebrating 21 years since the making of the film Pricilla Queen of the Desert, which was partly set in the city.

It was the first time the specially scheduled train was made available to festival goers.
Train manager Ross Johnston said the journey was a great success.
"The lipstick stops — where everyone gets out and takes photos and locals come and say hello — has been a really good time," he said.
"They're not just your regular passenger, they're looking forward to a great weekend."

Michael Dwyer made his way from the New South Wales central coast.
"The train is great, I love it, it's like you're suspended in another time," he said.
"Generally when you're travelling with people you don't get to know them. On this particular train you're getting to know them and you're realising that everyone has a story and it's great to hear it."
Thomas van de Berg first learned about Broken Hill and Pricilla Queen of the desert when he saw the film at a festival in Amsterdam in 1995.
He said the film inspired him to move to Australia.
"It was a really big experience for me," he said.
"The Aboriginal people and the gay community were dancing along together and it was so amazing. I said to myself 'one day I'll come to Australia'.
"Twenty years later I moved to Australia to make my home here because of this beautiful connection."

Marianne Bowler was headed to the festival for the first time with her daughter and budding young drag queen Arora Arsenic.
Ms Bowler, who makes many of Arora's outfits, said she loved being mother to a drag queen.
"I couldn't ask for anything more, we have so much fun together and it's fantastic," she said.
The pair had made their way to the train from Brisbane, and Aroura said being able to travel to a remote area for the event was a highlight.
"I'm from the suburbs. This is like seeing snow for the first time time, I've never seen red dirt before."

Maude Boat, famous for creating the foam wigs which were part of the inspiration for Pricilla Queen of the Desert, was the host of the train trip.
She said she had been up since 2:00am preparing for the journey, and the 14-hour trip was a new record for her for time spent in drag.
"I don't want to see a camera crew at the end of the trip. Unfortunately I don't think I should shave on a train, might come out covered in cuts!" she said.

Gayle Brooke from Wollongong, known as 'drag nan' to many in the drag scene, has been going to drag shows for 35 years.
She said she had been hoping to get to the festival for some time and the train made that possible.
"When they put the train on I was the first to buy a ticket. I was so excited," she said.
"It'll be a bit of a reunion. A lot of people I know are coming and I'm looking forward to nan hugs and glittery kisses."

Maria D'Angela and Donald Fuggle from Sydney were headed to the festival for the first time.
Mr Fuggle said the festival was a good chance to celebrate diversity as the nation prepares to vote on same sex marriage.
"We're having this plebiscite about gay marriage and it brings to light that not everyone's the same, and we have to embrace that difference," he said.
"Somewhere like Broken Hill really seems to embrace difference. And there seems to be a respect there. This festival really highlights that acceptance."



Twenty-four electricity retailers and tech companies have applied to be part of a scheme the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) says will help the country avoid looming blackouts this summer.
Under the scheme, large groups of households or business will be offered incentives, such as payments, to cut their electricity usage when the grid comes under stress.
ARENA business development manager Phil Cohn said, as an example, participating customers could be sent messages, telling them a high-stress period was expected at the next day, and asking them to switch of their air conditioner or pool pump for 30 minutes.
The agency and the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) announced their Demand Response trial program in May.
Mr Cohn said ARENA was now examining proposed projects under the scheme.
"We're going through our assessment and contracting process at the moment with the successful projects," he said.
"We got a wide range of energy retailers come in the door, from energy retailers through to new technology start-ups that are looking to utilise things in people's homes to control appliances and help manage energy use."
Experts have warned there is a high chance of blackouts this summer, partly caused by the closure of Hazelwood Power Station in Victoria.
Mr Cohn said the successful projects would be announced in October and they would need to be up and running by December, so the energy savings could be used in summer.
He said they would be in New South Wales, where the State Government is contributing funds, and in Victoria and South Australia.
The trial aims to save 160 megawatts on the National Electricity Market this summer, about one-tenth of the capacity of the Hazelwood plant.
Mr Cohn said that would provide some help in efforts to prevent blackouts this summer, combined with other measures relating to supply and demand, but the trial's true value was in fine tuning the most effective incentive models for the future.
He said the demand response model had been successful overseas, and major industries in Australia had been incentivised in the past to cut usage during high-stress periods, but this would be a first for Australian households.
"We estimate that if we had similar levels of demand response [incentives] being delivered here as there is in the United States, there is potentially about 3,000 megawatts of reserves there to be used, which is [equivalent to] two Hazelwood power stations," he said.
"What we are hoping to do through our trial, is to help commercialise new approaches and new technologies and inform the development of permanent market mechanisms to allow demand response to be a key feature of the energy market going forward."
The three-year trial will feature projects incorporating businesses and households.
Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews gave cautious support to the concept, saying such schemes were already in place for big business, but it was up to ARENA and AEMO to show the model could work for households.
"It has worked for big industries, for very big power consumers, smelters and the like, for a long time," he said.
"They can reduce their power usage, be rewarded for that, send that power back to the grid."
In total, $37.5 million funding is available for the first round of trial projects.


China's export performance clicked down another gear as weaker demand took its toll and the first signs of the stronger US dollar having an impact emerged.

The better news in the official figures for August released by Chinese customs officials was imports held up well indicating the domestic economy remained robust.
Exports slowed in both US dollar and local currency terms and were substantially lower than market forecasts.
ANZ's senior China economist Betty Wang was not alarmed by the export performance noting it came off a fairly high base.
The stronger than expected imports grew in US dollar terms and were relatively flat measured in the yuan.
While export growth slowed against the big economies — the US, Europe and Japan — it accelerated in most Asian economies.
From an Australian perspective, iron ore imports mirrored the domestic economy strength up almost 16 per cent on a year ago.
Capital Economics' Julian Evans-Pritchard noted the slowdown partly reflects the renminbi's recent appreciation against the US dollar — the currency in which most Chinese trade is priced
However, he said after adjusting for changes in import and export prices trade volumes weakened, and the stronger currency is probably not to blame for that given exporters have yet to meaningfully raise their US dollar prices in response to recent exchange rate movements.
"Instead, there appears to have been a broader decline in external demand," Mr Evans-Pritchard said.
The performance will be watched closely by the market, worried a hint that the yuan's rapid appreciation against the US dollar was affecting exports would trigger government intervention in the currency.
However, Ms Wang said on the available evidence this was unlikely.
"The strength in the yuan is unlikely to change our optimistic view on China's near-term export outlook," Ms Wang said.
"China's role in global supply chains is unlikely to be replaced at least for now."
Ms Wang noted China's export competitiveness is gradually shifting from low value-added to high-tech products.
"If Apple's share price is any indication, given that electronic shipments account for a major share of China's total exports, the country's export outlook is likely to be positive for now."



Doctors are pushing back against insurance companies asking them to send them their patients' entire health records as they make decisions about life insurance.

"I am very alarmed that there might be tens of thousands of people's entire health record across the country now stored with insurance companies," Labor Senator Deborah O'Neil told Parliament's joint committee on corporations and financial services.
Edwin Kruys from the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners told the committee doctors do not believe it is appropriate to send entire files to insurance companies.
"It contains information that is often not relevant to the claim, it is all sorts of information that patients have shared with their doctor over the years and they may not even remember what they have shared," Dr Kruys said.
Anne Trimmer from the Australian Medical Association (AMA) told the committee it is challenging for a doctor to determine which parts of a file are relevant.
"And you overlay that with doctors who are time poor with busy practices, it is really hard to make the determination of what is really relevant," she said.
Helen Troup who is managing director of the Commonwealth Bank's Life Insurance arm, CommInsure, told their insurance customers agreed to let doctors provide the files.
"We do get a full authority," Ms Troup said.
She said the company keeps the files but could not say how many it had.
"Our claims principle is to ask for information that is relevant to the claim assessment," she said.

But she said it sometimes meant the company received the full file.
"We of course take due care with that information," Ms Troup said.
But Dr Kruys said he did not take a tick in a box on a form as true consent from his patients to hand over their records, so he contacted them and checked.
He told the committee that they often then withdrew that consent and he would instead send a much more specific report.
Associate Professor Stephen Bradshaw of the Medical Board of Australia told the committee that the request for medical records could come months or years after the doctor had seen the patient.
"You have no idea what the context of the inquiry is and you are asked to give all the notes, it does put the doctor in an invidious position," he said.
He said it would be rare to track down the patient and check with them because medical practitioners do not have time as well as the pressure from the companies.
"You have got these legalistic letters coming to the practitioners saying 'you are required' and there is usually a whole lot of little fine print," Associate Professor Bradshaw said.
The medical aspect part of the broader complexities of life insurance that the committee is due to report at the end of next month.


A little less than two years ago, Launceston's The Royal Oak hotel reached out to one of the city's local artists.
The hotel wanted to put together an evening of solely female musicians, and Sarah Triffitt was the person it wanted pulling the strings.
"I was approached by management at the Oak about trying to get more female musicians into the venue and also as punters," Triffitt said.
"Instantly I was like: 'Yes. Please let me do this', I came up with the name and booked the first show and away we go."
The show was When She Believes and its first night back in October 2015 packed out the Oak's public bar to see the performers, some of whom were Triffett's friends called on as a favour.
"Not purposely to be guinea pigs, but [I said] 'Come and play this show, we're going to do this and it's going to be amazing', and all the people came and it was amazing," she said.
It did not take long for When She Believes to outgrow its original venue, and in the months since has played in several pubs across Launceston.
The focus has always been on showcasing female artists and creating an intimate and respectful relationship between the audience and performers.
"I'm quite happy to tell people to shut up and go outside and I've had to do that in the past," Triffitt said.
"I've had management do it once or twice for me as well as at a couple of venues that we've played, which is really great to have that support form management. They totally understand the concept and what it's about."

Indie folk artist Tiarni Cane said it had been the perfect environment for her to develop as a solo female artist.
"I feel like it was almost harder to be taken seriously (as a woman), it's not necessarily hard to get the start, but it's harder just to feel as if what you're doing is as respected as what, maybe, some other musicians are doing," Cane said.
"We've done a lot of gigs where you're up on stage and the people that are in the venue aren't necessarily there for your story or for the music.
"[At] When She Believes you can hear a pin drop when you're there and the only thing you can hear is the foldback and the sound of your music coming back at you.
"It's really flattering, and humbling and it's pretty terrifying to be honest, because there is no hiding in that environment,
"But I am so grateful to be able to have the chance to play multiple times for When She Believes and just feel that support from everyone."
Cane, along with fellow Launceston artist Denni Sulzberger, both played in the first gig at The Royal Oak.

Almost two years on and the pair will feature in When She Believes biggest show so far— Launceston's Junction Arts Festival.
Sulzberger said she had noticed attitudes shift in the local music scene over the past two years.
"Just the fact that it's creating more opportunity at the very, very base point, it's not saying we want 50 per cent of musicians in Launceston to be female, we don't care," said Sulzberger.
"It's just giving the opportunity, because woman can be scared to go to a pub, especially if you're by yourself, to go to a pub and do a performance.
"I feel a lot more respected going into venues, like when I go to play I get asked to do a lot more… but then again it may just be because I've been given the opportunity to get out there."
For curator, Triffitt, it is a social message of gender equality, which has played a large part in When She Believes' success.
"It resonates obviously with a massive part of the community that also feels that way and they support us because they want to see more quality as well, not just for music that's our thing, but it resonates with a lot of different areas of the community for what it represents as far as bridging the gap."


The charity supplies 85,000 meals a month, which are distributed by welfare agencies to vulnerable South Australians.
Foodbank SA manager Leigh Royans said it worked across the food chain with support from more than 100 growers and suppliers.
"A healthy diet is even more important to those people that are living on the margins," he said.
"We're lucky to have great support from the market authority and growers to actually make a difference," he said.
Foodbank SA receives retail-quality fresh food but does not baulk at taking less attractive produce.
"We also receive good-quality seconds produce that may not be just right for the retail shelf, and we make use of all."
Mr Royans had wondered if increasing turnover in fresh produce was justified, but said it was as popular as long-life food.
"We've found that we still fall short in the quantity of produce that we need donated so we've reset the benchmark and we're now moving beyond the current 1.1 million kilograms of donated fruit and veg we receive every year to aspirationally try and move to 1.5 million kilograms a year," Mr Royans said.
He said demand for food supplied by Foodbank SA was growing by 5 per cent a year.
"That doesn't sound huge but the cycle's going in the wrong direction, hence our supply needs to grow rather than shrink."
Angelo Demasi, from the SA Produce Market, valued food donations from local suppliers at $2.5 million.
He said it spared unsold - or unwanted - food from being wasted.
"It's not only edible product that may be going to landfill, it's also product that would normally go into your greengrocer store, so it's a remarkable achievement by our industry," Mr Demasi said.
Foodbank SA supplied food for about 85,000 meals a month which was distributed by welfare agencies.


The director of the soon-to-be-released movie Mother! has apologised for an advertising agency painting a picture of star Jennifer Lawrence over an iconic Newtown mural.
Darren Aronofsky took to social media saying he was "embarrassed and furious" at Apparition Media for "breaking #1 graffiti rule" on the side of the heritage building fronting Enmore Road in Sydney's inner west.

Mr Aronofsky also offered to replace the "It's like a jungle sometimes" mural, which was painted 20 years ago and based on the famous hip hop song The Message by Grandmaster Flash and Furious Five.
The ad agency has promised to remove the massive portrait of the actor within days and then restore the original mural with the help of the artist who painted it.
Tyson Hunter from Apparition Media apologised to the public and the artist and said the agency had "learnt the hard way".
"We should have got in contact with the original artist first and we certainly won't be interested in painting over any other spaces that have murals on them," Mr Hunter said.
"We respect the community and we respect that this has upset the community so it is our intention to try and remove it as quickly as possible."
The original artist, who asked to remain anonymous, told the ABC he painted the mural with several other artists during what he described as a "heavy time" in their lives.

"The mural was mean to be something that represented how I was feeling at the time and I was feeling beside myself, depressed and definitely a little suicidal, which is hard to say now," he said.
"The message then is the same message now, you know, that was the name of the song by Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five."
Mr Hunter said as a measure of goodwill to the artist, the hotline number for suicide prevention organisation Lifeline has been included on the mural.

The advertisement for the new Paramount Pictures was not sanctioned by local authorities.
Despite the plans made by the artist and ad agency to restore the original mural, Inner West Council is still investigating.
"Council did not approve this advertisement, and the display of advertisements is generally prohibited in heritage areas," a spokeswoman for the council said.
"Like many members of the public, [the Council] was very disappointed to see the iconic 'It's a Jungle Out There' [sic] artwork painted over," she said.
"While Council is pleased to see positive action to re-instate the iconic mural, the investigations by Council's compliance section will continue and if a breach is detected, appropriate regulatory action will be taken."
The maximum penalty by way of an infringement notice is $6,000 but in the event of prosecution a court has the power to impose a maximum $1.1 million fine.


The investors' loss appears to be the first home buyers' gain, as the rival bidders switched roles in July.

Investors weighed down by targeted interest rate hikes were in retreat for the third consecutive month, with the value of their loans falling by a solid 3.9 per cent to $12.1 billion.
In seasonally adjusted terms, the value of owner-occupier loans edged by 0.9 per cent to $21 billion, while overall commitments to buy slipped 0.9 per cent.
But the buyers with the biggest spring in their step appear to be first home owners, with number of loans to the sector jumping by 5.2 per cent over the month..
As has been the case in every month this year, first home buyers have carved out a larger slice of the market.
Having started the year near an historic low with just 13.4 per cent of all loan commitments, by July that had risen to 16.6 per cent.
Over the month, the average first home buyer loan rose by $4,000 to $321,800.
At the same time, the average loan size for all owner-occupied housing commitments fell $5,000 to $370,500.
"It looks like some stamp duty exceptions for first homebuyers following the 2017/18 round of state budgets has had a positive impact on first home buyer activity," CBA's Gareth Aird noted.
JP Morgan's Henry St John says the property market is showing signs of some wear and tear.
"The average loan size for owner-occupiers contracted for a second consecutive month, having fallen from a local peak of $380,000 in May to $371,000 in July," Mr St John said.
"Refinancing activity, which in the owner-occupier component of the data requires mortgage holders to have shifted from one bank to another, fell 0.7 per cent in volume terms, and is now running at -16.8 per cent over the year.

"This pattern appears to match with anecdotal evidence that suggests that as the banks have tightened their mortgage pricing, more restrictive lending standards have made it increasingly difficult to shift mortgages from one bank to another."
APRA's second phase of turning the screws on investor lending in April, which saw some aggressive interest rate rises from the banks, appears to be working.
Mr St John says investor lending has now strung together six months' worth of predominantly weak data in this series.
"Investor lending values have now declined 11.3 per cent over the last 6 months, and the annual run rate is now effectively flat," he said.
"This is consistent with the slowdown in investor credit which we have observed in recent months, and July's numbers suggest that there is scope for investor credit to continue to grind its way lower as we approach year-end."
CBA's Gareth Aird said most of the indicators on the housing market are pointing to a slowdown in dwelling price growth, including credit, auction clearance rates and record low yields.
Despite a slow down in construction financing — total lending for dwelling related construction fell by 3.7 per cent in July — it was off the back of a big 10 per cent jump in the previous month.
Mr Aird says the fall was not a cause for alarm.
"We don't see a hard landing for residential construction over the next few years," he said.
"The trends in the building approvals and lending data, coupled with strong underlying demand for housing, underpins our view that the decline in residential investment will be gradual and elongated.
"This means that the impact on the economy will be milder than in previous residential downturns."
However Mr Aird said the slowdown was likely to be a headwind on the economy over the next two years.



As if retailers weren't having a tough enough time already, now it looks likely the global giant Amazon is going to crash their Christmas party.

All the signs are Amazon could mobilise its Australian operations in the next 60 days, perhaps even as early next month, according to Citi retail analyst Brian Raymond.
"Buying terms have been set and first orders have been placed with suppliers in recent weeks," Mr Raymond said.
Amazon has also already announced it has secured a large fulfillment centre — a digital term for packaging warehouse — on the outskirts of Melbourne and staff recruitment has started.
A decision has yet to be made on a larger distribution centre in Sydney, but it is doubtful it would be up and running before the Christmas rush.
"Launch timing remains uncertain and subject to website and logistics testing, but we would expect a formal launch to occur sometime in October, ahead of Black Friday on 24 November," Mr Raymond wrote in a research note to clients.
Black Friday is the day after Thanksgiving and is regarded as the start of the pre-Christmas consumer binge in the US, a one-day, discount-fuelled buying frenzy.
Mr Raymond said Amazon was unlikely to have its full sales arsenal available in Australia immediately and therefore would compete aggressively on price alone.
"Amazon will not have a meaningful advantage in two of their three key pillars in the short term —  range and delivery, which will evolve over time," he said.
"As a result, we expect prices to be competitive in order to drive volume."
That margin crunching approach will do nothing to lift the festive spirits of local retailers affected by a customer base weighed down by low wage growth, high debt and shrinking savings.

The most recent retail figures showed sales largely stalled in July and went backwards in a number of states including New South Wales, South Australia and Tasmania.
Department stores, the sector most likely to be immediately and seriously impacted by Amazon, resumed their downward march, with sales declining 1.6 per cent in July, the tenth monthly fall in the past year.
Mr Raymond said the worry for the bricks-and-mortar retailers would be Amazon's strategy of matching or being the lowest price in the market at all times.
"This could spark a response from incumbent retailers who are intent on not being beaten by Amazon on price during the key pre-Christmas sales event," he said.
On Citi's figures, the sales impact in the three months leading up to New Years Day could be in the order of $200 million — or roughly 0.2 per cent of total Australian retail sales — with the bulk of the damage done by price competition, rather than the loss of market share.
As the initial target is likely to be the gift market, Citi argued the retailers likely to be hit first were department stores and those selling electronics, leisure goods, clothing and footwear.


Buildings with highly flammable non-compliant cladding may not be covered by insurance companies, the industry's peak body has warned as it calls for a national overhaul of construction regulations.
The dangers of aluminium cladding made with a polyethylene (PE) core — used to swathe buildings around the world — was highlighted after a fierce fire ripped through the Grenfell tower in London, killing 80 people.
Planning and fire experts have said there may be more than 5,000 buildings in Victoria that contain non-compliant cladding.
Campbell Fuller from the Insurance Council of Australia said some insurers would now refuse to cover buildings and apartments made with the materials.
"Buildings that do have these flammable materials are certainly going to struggle to get insurance," he told ABC Radio Melbourne.

"Many insurers will insure the building but may put fairly stringent conditions on the coverage, or put very high premiums on, or also put on very high excesses for claims.
"So that's sending a pretty strong price signal to the owners of the building and also to the construction industry and the Government that this is an issue that isn't going to go away without a large amount of intervention."
A Senate committee has recommended Australia ban the importation, sale and use of PE cladding, but the ban was not supported by Coalition members.
Mr Fuller said the insurance council wanted a national audit of buildings to uncover the full extent of the problem.
The ABC's Four Corners program revealed Australian suppliers of cladding made with PE knew it was highly flammable a decade before the deadly London fire.
Mr Fuller said the insurance industry was now acting as a "canary in the coal mine", sending a warning to governments, builders and developers on the need to overhaul the entire regulatory system.
The current method of self-regulation was not working and was putting lives at risk, he said.

"Insurers send signals to markets through prices and through availability of product, it's the same in flood or cyclone-exposed areas of Australia — where the risks are high, the premiums will follow," he said.
"It's disappointing we've had the Lacrosse [building] fire in Melbourne, but it's taken the Grenfell fire in the UK for focus to return.
"Developers are always wanting to put things up faster to meet demand. Where, of course, there is unmet housing demand there is always pressure on governments to make sure these things can go up faster, but when human life is compromised, then surely a more prudent approach needs to be taken."
Mr Fuller said ultimate responsibility fell to property owners to inform insurers if the building had the cladding.
"The cost that's passed onto the building owners could be very, very steep," Mr Fuller said.
The Queensland Government has ordered the removal of the material from the Princess Alexandra Hospital, and the Victorian Government has set up a taskforce to investigate the extent of non-compliant cladding on buildings.

Australia's prudential regulator has appointed a panel of corporate veterans to progress its inquiry into Commonwealth Bank.
One of the appointees is the former chairman of the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, Dr John Laker.
APRA has also picked the ACCC's former chairman, Professor Graeme Samuel, and a former Reserve Bank board member, Jillian Broadbent, to conduct its prudential inquiry.
The purpose of its inquiry is to identify any shortcomings in CBA's governance, culture, and accountability frameworks and practices, the regulator said in a statement on Friday.
APRA will also assess whether the bank's remuneration and governance framework conflicts with "sound risk management".
This is in light of "a number of incidents in recent years that have damaged the reputation and public standing of the CBA group".
But the limitation is that the inquiry "should not make specific determinations regarding matters currently the subject of legal proceedings, other regulatory reviews or investigations by regulators other than APRA, or customers' individual cases," the regulator said.
These "current legal proceedings" are a reference to AUSTRAC's case in the Federal Court against CBA.

Due to the extent of AUSTRAC's allegations against Australia's largest bank — almost 54,000 alleged breaches of anti-money laundering laws — it could take CBA three months to file its defence.
The normal timeframe for a defendant to file its defence is 28 days, according to court rules.
CBA is also facing a potential class action from aggrieved shareholders, who saw the value of their shares drop after news of AUSTRAC's litigation against the bank became public.
On top of that, ASIC is investigating CBA for its potential breach of continuous disclosure laws.
"I think we'll be able to get to the heart of the real issues which have occurred here," Federal Treasurer Scott Morrison said at a press conference on Friday morning.
"It's not some general fishing expedition into alleged wickedness.
"This is practical action — taking action now on the issues that need to be addressed at CBA, and that's what APRA will be doing through this inquiry."
The APRA inquiry panel is expected to submit a progress report next year, on January 31, and the deadline for its final report is April 30.


A clown in a stormwater drain talks to a young boy who has come looking for his paper boat.
The emblematic image of the 1990 TV miniseries IT, inspired by the 1986 Stephen King novel of the same name, is an absurd composite of the everyday and the sinister that's inspired a thousand memes.

The moment itself, a grotesque stranger danger vignette that quickly transforms from innocuous to horrific, is a stand in for what the story goes on to explore.
A group of children in the small Maine town of Derry are haunted by the malevolent shapeshifting entity Pennywise, the dancing clown, who symbolises the deep, pervasive evil beneath the surface of middle America.
This week, a slick remake by Argentine horror director Andres Muschietti (Mama) breathes fresh life into the sewer demon, otherwise known to the kids as It.
The partial adaptation focuses only on his victims in childhood, rather than following them into adulthood as in the original, and transposes the 1960s setting into the late 1980s.
It's not hugely dissimilar to Netflix's Stranger Things, and a star of that series, the gangly Finn Wolfhard, appears here.
The imprint of Korean cinematographer Chung-hoon Chung (Oldboy, Stoker) pervades the film. It sweeps you away with sheer visual elegance, seamlessly segueing from one carefully-crafted camera move to the next.

But this stylistic gloss often comes at the expense of the original's uneven, often gritty charm, not to mention its more upfront satire. Gone is Tim Curry's camp performance of Pennywise, who has been transformed by Bill Skarsgard into something more unambiguously threatening.
And the fluid camerawork might be well-suited to establishing mood, but Muschietti is less capable with the heavy lifting of horror jolts and scares.
Reports of a troubled pre-production period proliferated after the departure of the director's predecessor on the film, True Detective's Cary Fukunaga, two years ago. It might be one of the reasons It seems to struggle to pull it all together.

Muschietti handles the group tensions between the six boys and one girl, who call themselves The Losers, by drawing out some vivid, individual quirks, but the film doesn't reach the emotional pathos of precedents like Stand By Me, another King adaptation.
Pennywise of course is more than a vague bogeyman — he's a pointer towards real-world evils that involve the characters directly.
A chilling subplot of child abuse, relevant to the girl in particular, is a confronting reminder of the grim reality behind the fantasy, and a bathroom covered in blood that only the children see is a particularly well-handled plot device that establishes the idea of a collective waking nightmare.

But the theme of the town's history of racial conflict seems underdeveloped, as if the film is too busy establishing a Goonies-style adventure.
While Fukunaga wasn't necessarily a better choice for director, you wonder what the film might have been if it managed to lasso its various traumatic subplots into an overarching, True Detective-style statement about America's murky side.

Muschietti's film — for all its sophisticated craft and sugary thrills — falls just short of embedding its likeable characters into the subtext of American corruption and injustice.
Pennywise remains a chilling figure, lurking beneath the streets of a small Maine town, but you feel his most poignant appearances are still to come.
Maybe some of those will be in the planned sequel — or perhaps in meme form.


Almost a quarter of Australia's top 200 listed companies have no women in their senior executive leadership teams, raising fresh concerns about whether corporate diversity policies are addressing gender imbalance.

Research from the body committed to lifting the number of women in senior roles, Chief Executive Women (CEW), shows 41 companies in the ASX 200 do not have female representation at the most senior management levels of the company.
Based on information gathered from company websites, the gender imbalance is more stark in 126 companies where there are no women in line roles answering to the executive team.
Only 5 per cent of ASX 200 companies have a female chief executive, while 9 per cent have a female chief financial officer.
However, CEW's senior executive census shows that in 2017 men still held 79 per cent of roles in senior executive teams.
Reserve Bank board member Kathryn Fagg, president of CEW, said while the study was a big improvement compared with a decade ago, the slow progress was disappointing.
"There is a long way to go, there is no question about that," she said.
"It becomes even more evident when you look at the number of women in line roles as well as the women in functional roles.
"When you look at the companies that have made the most progress, it is really clear that they have picked up the challenge and proactively gone in and said we need to do things differently.
"There is no doubt that it is men actively saying we are going to speak out and make a difference, particularly through the Male Champions of Change that has really helped us make the progress."
Top companies with no women in senior executive teams include Woodside Petroleum, Amcor, James Hardie, Alumina, Qube Holdings, JB Hi Fi and Seven Group Holdings.
Companies with the best female representation in senior management include Estia Health (57 per cent), G8 Education (56 per cent), Tatts Group (55 per cent), Viva Energy (50 per cent) and Sigma Healthcare (50 per cent).
By industry sector, men dramatically overshadow women in line management roles notably in telecommunications (83 per cent), real estate (84 per cent), healthcare (85 per cent) and financials (87 per cent).
However, women are better represented in human resources, corporate affairs and legal departments.

Deloitte Australia chief executive Cindy Hook said it was disappointing that a significant portion of corporate Australia has not pushed for greater diversity.
"It's not an easy thing to get to gender diversity," she said.

"This research shows that more attention needs to be paid to this. It's really an opportunity that some companies are missing.
"Some companies just use old excuses on why it can't happen — you know, 'women take off for maternity leave'.
"That's not a reason that women can't be in your workforce and well represented in giving you diverse teams."
Despite the slow progress, Ms Fagg cautioned against the use of quotas to lift the representation of women at senior executive levels.
"I think that most people would prefer that we don't have to go to quotas and a mandate set by government," Ms Fagg said.
"The reality is that where progress is being made in nearly all cases, targets have been set because in organisations we respond to targets."
Even so, major institutional investors including big industry funds say they might use their clout at annual general meetings to force companies to commit to real gender diversity.
Australian Super chief executive Ian Silk recently told the ABC that company boards could come under renewed pressure to bridge the pay gap between men and women.
Research by Male Champions of Change says 120 executives have committed to "narrowing" the 15.3 per cent gap in "like for like" roles.

Wall Street had a relatively weak day as gold prices surged back to their one-year high, and the Australian dollar remains stubbornly high at 80.45 US cents.

Meanwhile, two sets of economic figures, from Australia and China, may influence the direction of local share trading today.
Although most sectors posted gains, the financial sector slid 1.7 per cent amid US Treasury yields falling to 10-month lows.
Financials were the biggest drag on Wall Street's overall performance — with large banks Goldman Sachs, Bank of America and Citigroup dropping more than 1.3 per cent each.
Apple also weighed on the major indexes, dropping 0.4 per cent, following a report from the Wall Street Journal about the upcoming iPhone 8 being hit with a number of production glitches.
Disney shares fell 4.4 per cent after the entertainment giant issued a profit warning.
The company will report earnings-per-share this year, "roughly in line" with what it earned in fiscal year 2016, Disney CEO Bob Iger said.
On the data front, the number of Americans filing for unemployment soared to its highest level in more than two years due to the impact of Hurricane Harvey.
There were 62,000 new applications last week, according to the Department of Labour, with seasonally-adjusted initial claims now totalling 298,000.
ECB president Mario Draghi said on Thursday that the euro's strength was already weighing on inflation, and will be a key factor for the central bank next month — when it decides how to proceed with its massive stimulus program.
Since the start of the year, the euro has risen 14 per cent against the US dollar.
This is a double-edged sword for the European currency. It reflects a strong economy, but makes its exports less competitive while reducing the cost of imports.
The euro's sharp rally was the main reason for a downgrade in the ECB's new 2018-19 inflation forecasts.  Now, the bank is further away from achieving its target of almost 2 per cent inflation.
"The medium-term outlook for inflation was revised downward in the staff's projections, mainly due to the appreciation of the exchange rate, which means that we will have to take into account this element in our information set in our future policy decisions," Mr Draghi said.
With SPI futures up 0.3 per cent, a slightly higher open for the Australian share market looks likely.
In local economic news, the Bureau of Statistics will release July's housing finance figures.
It will reveal how many new loans were granted for owner-occupied homes, and is an indicator of demand in the housing market.
The number of new home loans is predicted to rise by 1 per cent in July, according to -polled economists.
China's trade balance figures for August will also be released today, and may affect the movement of the Australian share market.
"Our team expects China's surplus to have widened modestly and that growth in both exports and imports will have increased," Deutsche Bank economist Phil Odonaghoe said.
Deutsche Bank's estimate is that China's August exports (on an annual basis) will rise by 8.9 per cent, and imports will lift by 14.2 per cent.


The McGowan Government is at risk of simultaneous wars with both business and the union movement, after an angry reaction to measures announced in its first budget yesterday.

Treasurer Ben Wyatt will be trying to ease anger from the top end of town, after increasing payroll tax and gold royalties, when he fronts a post-budget breakfast with about 1,000 business leaders this morning.
While facing a backlash from business, unions are also angry at moves to cut thousands of public sector jobs within the next year.
But, after releasing a budget yesterday afternoon that broke Labor's promise not to hike taxes, Mr Wyatt was standing firm on its controversial measures.
"We could have imposed more cost pressures onto households in Western Australia or we could try to spread that burden on budget repair," Mr Wyatt said.
Business warned the budget would have a crippling impact on the economy, with large companies to face a higher payroll tax bill over the next five years and gold miners facing a substantial royalty hike.
The payroll tax increase only applies to businesses with wage bills above $100 million but will mean nearly one in 10 employers in WA will pay more.

"Today's budget will affect jobs and it will stall economic recovery," Chamber of Commerce and Industry chief executive Deidre Willmott warned yesterday.
The gold royalty hike, which is worth nearly $400 million to the budget, could face a particularly strong backlash after miners led a big campaign when the Barnett Government considered such a measure.
After the budget, the mining lobby was already warning of a severe impact from the move.
"This budget is a real slap in the face in the gold sector," Chamber of Minerals and Energy acting chief executive Nicole Roocke said.
At the same time, the Government will also be dealing with an angry response from its union base to a move to offer 3,000 voluntary redundancies to public sector employees.
Community and Public Sector Union branch secretary Toni Walkington said the public sector was already stretched enough, before further cuts.
"The Treasurer's claim this budget is about job creation cannot be believed when it includes 3,000 local jobs to be cut," Ms Walkington said.

But some of the budget's most contentious measures could struggle to get through parliament, due to Labor's lack of numbers in the Upper House.
Both the gold royalty hike and payroll tax increase could be voted down in the Upper House, where Labor needs the support of minor parties or the opposition to pass its measures.
Liberal leader Mike Nahan left the door open to blocking tax and royalty hikes, something which could blow an $827 million hole in the budget.
"We hold our right to hold them to account for their clearly enunciated commitments," he said.
But Mr Wyatt urged both the Opposition and crossbenchers to be "responsible", admitting he was concerned budget measures could be blocked.
"I urge [them] not to be budget wreckers ... but assume a shared responsibility in resolving the challenges which confront us," Mr Wyatt said.



Adelaide's Charles Sturt Council is expected to vote next week to remove parking meters from Henley Beach, just weeks after they were controversially introduced.
Last month, the council brought in a $2 per hour charge for a maximum stay of three hours in the car parks to the north and south of the Henley Square precinct.
Mayor Angela Evans announced on her Facebook page that council staff were recommending the removal of the parking machines.
"Council staff have now explored a range of options to try and address the concerns raised over the past month by residents, traders and visitors," she wrote.
"Their conclusion is that these concerns cannot be adequately addressed."
Charles Sturt councillor Jassmine Wood said the council had heard the outcry, including a petition that attracted 8,000 signatures.
"Everyone is just so relieved and so excited, it still needs to be passed by council... but we can rest assured the problem is solved entirely," she said.
"I think it's a very valuable but expensive lesson learned, in that our ratepayers are the people we are voted to represent... we need to listen to what they want more, and we need to consult before making contentious decisions such as this."
Although the meters were installed during the winter low season, the car parks appeared emptier than usual with motorists filling up free spaces further along the Esplanade.
Traders blamed paid parking for a drop in business, and a protest was being organised by local groups including the Henley Surf Life Saving Club.
Ms Wood said the council would have avoided "expense and trouble" if it had consulted over paid parking in the first place.
The matter will come before a vote at the council meeting on Monday.


Investors losing millions of dollars, bar staff taking cash from the till just to get paid and a former cricketer dropping out of a high-profile marketing deal — the final years of the Nant Whisky investment scheme were a wild ride.

Once a darling of Australia's boutique spirits scene, the whisky label is now a cautionary tale for investors.
As police in Tasmania begin a criminal investigation into the failed investment scheme, the ABC's Background Briefing program can reveal new details about how it all went sour.
Almost 900 investors purchased barrels of whisky after production began at Nant's distillery north of Hobart in 2008.
The barrels cost up to $14,000 each and would be stored in a bonded warehouse on the property until the whisky had matured — a process that was expected to take four years, according to the Nant investment offer.
Nant promised to then buy back the barrels, rewarding investors for their patience with a generous return of 9.55 per cent each year.
The scheme was designed to help Nant cover upfront expenses until the operation was profitable.
But for hundreds of the investors, both here in Australia and overseas, their long-awaited payday never materialised.
Nant's founder, Keith Batt, a bankrupt former property developer from Brisbane, has maintained a low profile ever since.
Background Briefing found him living in a $1.4 million home with river views in the affluent Brisbane suburb of Hamilton. The property was purchased in 2013 using a business registered in his wife Margaret's name.
Mr Batt declined to be interviewed and never responded to a comprehensive list of questions delivered to his door.

During a holiday in Tasmania in 2012 Jo McCarter and her husband toured the Nant distillery. They were impressed with what they saw.
After returning to Brisbane, the couple accepted an offer to buy two barrels of whisky for $11,000 and get one free.
"Interest rates in banks had been pretty ordinary for the last few years, so I just liked the idea that we were getting a bit more bang for our buck," said Ms McCarter.
"Probably a little bit too much bang, in hindsight."
The McCarters received a complimentary bottle of Nant whisky in the mail, certificates of ownership for their barrels and a signed letter from Mr Batt welcoming them to the fold.
"It all sounded quite flash, a bit posh — something we weren't used to," she said.
When her mother died, Ms McCarter decided to invest her son and daughter's inheritance in an attempt to grow their wealth.
She purchased multiple barrels for her children and a few extra for herself and her husband, increasing the family's collection to 10 barrels, worth a combined $116,000.
"If we had realised our investment, if we had got back what we expected to get back, it would have been in the vicinity of $170,000," she said.

But to this day, the McCarters have not received a cent.
Late last year, after reading media reports suggesting Nant was struggling financially, the couple made several attempts to contact sales representatives over the phone to enquire about their investment but were unsuccessful.
Then Ms McCarter remembered that while Nant made its whisky in Tasmania, the administrative staff were based in Queensland, Mr Batt's home state.
She decided to visit the head office in Brisbane, but arrived to find it closed.
"We started to feel a little bit sick in the stomach then," said Ms McCarter.
"This is it, we've lost all our money."
There was a brief glimmer of hope when Australian Whisky Holdings (AWH), a publicly listed company, announced a takeover of Nant last October.
Investors were relieved, and were optimistic the new owners would fix the mess.

But after AWH conducted a thorough stocktake as part of its due diligence, it was revealed that a staggering 700 barrels had never been filled with whisky.
The audit also found an unknown number of barrels were either missing or had been secretly decanted, bottled and sold to the public without the knowledge of investors.
In a letter sent to the McCarters in April, they were told five of their barrels of whisky simply did not exist.
The remainder had been filled with low-volume alcohol that would not reach maturity for many years to come.
"We were shocked, disappointed," Ms McCarter said.
"We sit here at night watching TV and see people on A Current Affair that have had their life savings taken away from them investing in stupid schemes and I kind of feel like we've been stupid as well."
Speaking for the first time, two former employees have shed new light on the circumstances that brought the much-hyped investment scheme undone.
Annie Morgan was the senior bookkeeper for Nant. She told Background Briefing the distillery in Bothwell was struggling to keep up with demand when she was hired nearly three years ago.

"When our barrel investor manager left in October, 2014, she had mentioned to me that there were about 900 barrels that were unfilled," said Ms Morgan.
In a promotional video released last year, Mr Batt appears to defend the delays, explaining that the production of high quality whisky cannot be rushed.

"We don't apologise for taking our time to make the whisky and to fill barrels and to make sure that every single thing we do is perfect," he said.
"We take a great deal of care and we just want to be able to educate our customers and our barrel investors that, you know, magic takes time."
In a subsequent interview with the alcohol industry news website The Shout, Mr Batt insisted he had a plan to fill the empty barrels and said Australian Whisky Holdings was well aware of it.
"They've made out that it was never our intent to fill the barrels, that we've just taken the investment and then pissed off, but that's just not true," he said.
"We had bought four new stills, we had 600 new barrels in the shed, we spent hundreds of thousands of dollars getting ready for expansion to meet our back orders because the barrel program has just been so successful."
The production problems worried former distiller Anthony White, who began to fear that investors expecting to receive returns within four years would be let down.
"If those persons' barrels weren't getting manufactured for two years after they'd purchased the barrel, there was no way they were going to be paid on maturation of their barrel after four years," he said.
Mr White was also uncomfortable with a marketing strategy that ultimately backfired. It involved labelling bottles of whisky with the number of the barrel from which the spirit was sourced.
The gimmick proved popular but was ultimately abandoned when a handful of investors discovered whisky from their barrels had been decanted and bottled without their knowledge.
"They actually took the cask number off the bottles after that point so no-one was aware of what cask number was in those bottles."
As confusion reigned over the barrels, bills were piling up and Mr Batt was developing a reputation for being unreliable when it came to paying suppliers who did jobs for Nant.
Background Briefing has seen an unpaid invoice for more than $100,000 relating to work builder Ben Nicholls completed at the Bothwell estate.
This was just the tip of the iceberg, according to Ms Morgan, the former senior bookkeeper, who remembers fielding multiple calls from other angry tradespeople.
"It was embarrassing. I was the one copping the abuse from them because they wanted their money," she said.

Even former Australian cricketer Matthew Hayden, who was approached to be the public face of Nant in 2014, was forced to terminate his contract when he stopped receiving income.
"Sadly when I got through about half of the first year of my contract, monies then ceased to be getting paid," he said.
Mr Batt and his wife Margaret had established a complicated network of businesses.
According to a diagram created by their accountants, Wallace Group, and obtained by Background Briefing, there were at least a dozen separate entities associated with Nant.
Around half of them are now under administration or in the process of being deregistered.
There are also fresh allegations barrel sales figures were altered before paperwork was submitted to the Australian Tax Office (ATO).
In December 2014, Mr Batt wrote to Ms Morgan to ask: "Annie, can you reduce the barrel sales in that quarter by 350 thousand dollars?"

Reducing the barrel sales had the effect of decreasing the amount of tax Nant paid that quarter.
In a separate email exchange in February 2015, Mr Batt made a similar request: "Annie, I'd like to get that down to 100 thousand, if possible."
According to Ms Morgan, Mr Batt believed that although the barrels in question had been sold, Nant was not required to pay any GST until they were filled with whisky.
But by the time Australian Whisky Holdings inspected the books earlier this year, Nant owed the ATO more than a million dollars. The ATO declined to comment on the case.
In August, Background Briefing revealed Tasmania Police had launched a criminal investigation into Nant in response to allegations of fraudulent conduct.
Queensland Police are probing a separate Nant investment scheme that involved selling Angus cattle, promising the same 9.55 per cent return.
It is understood the Australian Securities Investments Commission is unsure whether it has the power to act in the case, as the barrels and bulls may be classed as property rather than financial products.

But rather than relying on others to investigate, Harrison Scarf, who was employed at a now defunct Nant bar in Brisbane, decided to take matters into his own hands.
When he and his colleagues failed to receive their wages last June, he called their hospitality manager, who implied they were unlikely to get their money and should stop working immediately.
Mr Scarf ignored that advice, instead devising a plan to claw back what they were owed.
"We'll stay open tonight," he recalls telling another bartender.
"We'll tell everyone the EFTPOS machine is down, we'll just take complete cash sales, and hopefully we can make enough money to pay ourselves out.
"Then we'll just empty the tills on Saturday night, leave our payslips in there, walk out, lock the doors, and never come back. And that's how we got our money."

Australian Whisky Holdings pulled the plug on the Nant takeover in March when it discovered the full extent of the debt the business had accrued.
The company instead decided to purchase only the Nant name and the whisky production assets.
It is now running its own distilling operation on the Bothwell estate.


Two Australian companies who want to help build high-tech future warships have been told their involvement in a $35 billion Defence project could lead to costly delays of at least two years.
West Australian company Austal and its South Australian partner ASC are furiously lobbying to ensure they can construct the Navy's Future Frigates, which will be based on a yet-to-be-selected international design.
Spanish company Navantia, UK firm BAE Systems and Italian shipbuilder Fincantieri have been shortlisted in a fierce competition to design, build and sustain nine new anti-submarine warfare frigates to replace Australia's existing Anzac frigate fleet.

The ABC has been told a joint Austal and ASC bid for the build of the frigates won initial support from some federal cabinet ministers, before the Defence Department convinced the Government the proposal should only be "optional", not "mandated".
"Advice from the Department of Defence is that changing the request for tender to mandate a particular shipbuilder would result in a delay of at least two years in the Future Frigates program," Defence Industry Minister Christopher Pyne said in a statement.
"The Government is committed to creating an indigenous naval shipbuilding industry in Australia which will involve a significant increase of employees in the shipbuilding industry, focused on South Australia."
Representatives of the international companies competing for the Future Frigates project have also privately echoed warnings of significant delays if the Government mandates a certain shipbuilder.
Austal chief executive David Singleton insisted the participation of his company and ASC in the building phase would not complicate or delay the Future Frigates project.
"We bring our ships in on time and on cost and everybody knows that," Mr Singleton told the ABC.
The program will come under scrutiny today during a parliamentary inquiry into the future of Australia's naval shipbuilding industry.
"Given the amount of money that's being spent here, we have to ensure that we are not just providing work for foreign shipyards," said Labor senator Kim Carr, who will take part in the inquiry.


Power giant AGL has ceased installations of household batteries in Adelaide as part of a trial "Virtual Power Plant" and is flagging a change of battery technology, but won't confirm if it is experiencing problems with its current product.
The scheme went live in March and has seen hundreds of households install with Sunverge batteries, heavily subsidised by AGL and the Federal Government's renewable energy agency ARENA.
Under the scheme, flagged as "the largest project of its kind in the world", AGL has the power to simultaneously discharge power from the batteries into the grid, helping secure the grid when needed.
AGL wrote to prospective customers this week, alerting them that the company is ceasing installations as it plans to introduce "next-generation battery technology into our next phase of installations".
Two months ago AGL customer Rob Fitzgerald had an AGL battery system installed at a short-term rental property he owns in Parkside, to help control spiralling electricity costs.
Yet he said the near-new battery was now in line for replacement.
"In August we had this one installed and I got a call the other day to say they're upgrading the system, upgrading the battery. Technology's changed," Mr Fitzgerald said.
"They said it should be around about November when they put the battery in and do the upgrades."
"I can see the battery is working fine. But they tell me there's upgraded technology happening. So I read that as something's gone wrong with the battery, something's failing with the battery or something has failed with the battery."
Mr Fitzgerald said he had paid extra for equipment which would enable the battery to operate during a blackout, but had been advised by AGL to switch off that functionality.
"We paid about $1,000 extra for that. I got a call from AGL, that said there was some issue, some software problem, some glitch in the system," he said.
"So they've actually asked me to turn it off and they're looking at a fix there. Hopefully they'll happen soon."
AGL would not respond directly to the ABC's questions about whether there had been problem with the current Sunverge battery technology.
A company spokesman said "the SA Virtual Power Plant pilot is successfully working as a pilot should — new technology is being tested in the market and based on lessons learned, the program is being adapted".
"AGL also notes that the Virtual Power Plant has not paused, and remains live, operational and safe," the spokesman said.
The power provider did not respond directly to the ABC's questions about how many customers would have their battery systems replaced, and the reasons for their replacement, but said the program's "early adopters" would be offered an "upgrade to the next generation offering".
"Lessons and customer feedback from the initial phase of the project are being used to shape subsequent phases and we want to ensure that all customers have an opportunity to opt in to the next generation offering," the spokesman said.
AGL said it would reach out to all registered Virtual Power Plant customers over coming days to discuss project updates with each customer individually.


Chief Inspector John 'Jack' Thomas, who has died aged 91, has been remembered for saving the lives of many Victorians in his work with early breathalysers in the 1960s, an Australian first.
For his significant contribution to the community in reducing Victoria's staggering road toll, the retired policeman has received a ceremonial funeral in his hometown of Echuca.
His work as the officer-in-charge of the Breath Analysis Section of Victoria Police in the early 1960s saw him pioneer the use of evidential breath analysis as a method of law enforcement in Australia, which contributed to changing community attitudes towards drink driving.
Evidential breath analysis was introduced in Victoria in 1966, two years after research completed by American Professor Robert Borkenstein — the inventor of the breathalyser — in 1964 which found a single-vehicle collision increased exponentially as the blood alcohol increased.
Based upon this research, evidential breath analysis was introduced in Victoria in 1966.
In 1970, the Victorian road toll was 1,061.
At midnight on September 6, 2017, the road toll was 175.
"I remember in the early days if someone got busted for .05 they'd say 'Oh, you poor thing'," his son and retired police officer Neil Thomas recalled.
He said the introduction of the breathalyser, to which his father was a strong campaigner, "completely changed" community attitudes.
Such was Mr Thomas' commitment to reducing the road toll he was awarded numerous awards including the Queens Police Medal, the National Police Service Medal, the Groves Medal from the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons, in addition to an honorary fellowship.
"To be a fellow of the College of Surgeons you're meant to be a surgeon. But because he'd done so much to save lives, he was awarded that," Mr Thomas said.

While the Victorian road toll was exceptionally high in 1970, it reflected the high number nationally with a record 3,798 deaths.
Research Professor Brian Fildes from the Monash Accident Research Centre said the number of people killed was almost a direct correlation with the number of vehicles on the road.
"The more vehicles we put on the road the more people were dying as a result of road accidents," he said.
"It was really quite a trauma at that point."
According to Professor Fildes, after 1970 "things changed fairly dramatically" with the number of deaths falling, while the number of vehicles continued to increase.
He attributed this to the implementation of a more scientific approach in tackling the road toll with Australia taking its lead from American physician Dr William Hadden, a leader in highway accident research and prevention in the United States.
"He started to think of the road toll in much the same way as you would think of any other health condition," Professor Fildes said.
The three crucial 'instruments' Dr Hadden studied for reducing road toll were the human factor, the vehicle and the road.
Some of his key findings around changing behavioural patterns resulted in focusing on reducing drink driving and speeding, which resulted in speed programs and random breath testing (RBT).
"We as a country were learning about the role of alcohol in crashes back in those days and this random breath testing approach — were people were pulled over and tested for their level of alcohol — was something that developed during the 80s and 90s," Professor Fildes said.
Even though Chief Inspector Thomas was working with breathalysers as early as 1961, it was not until 1976 that Victoria became the first state to introduce RBT legislation.

This was followed five years later by the Northern Territory and South Australia, and in 1982 it was introduced to New South Wales and ACT.
However, Professor Fildes said it had only been in the past decade that Australia has really understood the role of alcohol in car crashes, reflected in the reduced death rate.
In the year 2000 there were 9.5 deaths per 100,000 people, and in 2014 there were five deaths per 100,000 — but with more work needed.
"In the last couple of years we're starting to see a bit of an upturn in the road toll and that's of great concern to everyone," Professor Fildes said.
While he had currently only completed a preliminary analysis of new figures, and was reluctant to draw any conclusions, he said speed was a significant factor that should be focused on.
"It probably took us about 20 years or so for the community to actually accept [RBT], that it wasn't safe to drink and drive, and I think we're only at the start of that when it comes to speeding," he said.
"In another twenty years people will understand that it is equally as dangerous to speed as it is to drink and drive."


Bruce Gordon has successfully delayed a key creditors meeting as part of a last-ditch attempt to thwart the sale of the Ten Network to CBS.
The second creditors' meeting will now occur on September 19 — one week later than what Ten's administrator KordaMentha had originally planned.
Mr Gordon's WIN Corporation and Birketu filed an urgent application in the Supreme Court of NSW on Wednesday to prevent the meeting from going ahead next week, due to alleged deficiencies in the second creditors' report.
So urgent was this application that Justice Ashley Black, and the barristers for CBS and the administrators, had not even received  WIN's "revised outline of submissions" until the first few minutes of the Thursday court hearing.
One of the alleged deficiencies is that the administrator failed to provide sufficient reasons why it supports CBS's takeover proposal.
Another argument will be whether the administrators should have considered selling Ten to Mr Gordon and Lachlan Murdoch prior to its collapse.
These substantive arguments will be heard in court next week on September 12 and 13 (next Tuesday and Wednesday).
Messrs Gordon and Murdoch were the front-runners to take over Ten, and were waiting for the Federal Government to amend media ownership laws, which would have allowed a deal to proceed.
However, with CBS being Ten's most likely future owner, the billionaire investors have become the "disappointed underbidders".
Richard McHugh SC, representing the administrator, argued in court that the "disappointed underbidders" should have filed their application "weeks or months ago".
"They shouldn't be given a free run to advance their commercial interest."
Justice Black told the parties that their case involved "significant complexities", and noted the short time between the second hearing day (September 13) and the rescheduled creditors' meeting (September 19).
However, he will not be hearing the case next week, and there is a risk that the case might not be resolved in six days.
"Whichever judge hears the matter next week will have to do the best he or she can," he said.


The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission will test its new found powers to protect small business from unfair contracts in an action against one of Australia's largest waste management companies, JJ Richards.
In the first action of its type since the Australian Consumer Law was extended to cover standard contracts involving small businesses, the ACCC will take JJ Richards to the Federal Court alleging numerous clauses in the company's standard contract breach the new laws.
The ACCC said the contracts which were used until at least April this year were unfair because they created a significant imbalance in the rights and obligations of JJ Richards and their small business customers.
The ACCC will also allege the standard contracts were not "reasonably necessary" to protect JJ Richard's legitimate interests and would, if relied on, cause significant financial detriment to small businesses.
JJ Richards is ranked in the top 100 of an IBISWorld survey of Australia's biggest privately-owned businesses, with annual revenues of around $680 million from a range of recycling and waste collection services.
The unfair contract terms the ACCC has raised in its action include:
"This is the first time the ACCC has taken court action to enforce the new laws that protect small businesses from unfair contract terms," ACCC deputy chair Michael Schaper said.
"In 2016, the ACCC engaged with a range of industries to encourage compliance with the new laws and reviewed small business contracts in a range of industries, including the waste management industry."
That consultation phase saw a number of large corporations including Australia Post, News Limited, Optus and Scentre Group (Westfield's local spin-off) amend or remove contract terms which may have been deemed "unfair".
The new law covers contracts between businesses where one of the firms employs less than 20 people and the contract is worth up to $300,000 in a single year, or $1 million if the contract runs for more than a year.
The ACCC argued standard form contracts provide little, or no, opportunity for the responding party to negotiate the terms — they are offered on a 'take it or leave it' basis.
"This action should serve as a reminder to large businesses that haven't already to review their standard form contracts to ensure they aren't considered to be unfair under the changes to the law, " Dr Schaper said.
The ACCC will ask the court to deem the terms unfair, and consequently void, and place injunctions on JJ Richards preventing it entering into future contracts with small businesses that contain them.


The McGowan Government has abandoned a key election commitment just months after coming into office, slugging businesses with higher taxes in its first state budget despite promising not to.
Big businesses will see their payroll tax bills rise, while gold miners will also be slugged with higher royalties as part of Treasurer Ben Wyatt's attempt to bring WA's budget back to surplus by 2021.

Thousands of voluntary redundancies will be sought from the public service and an axe will be taken to the Royalties for Regions (RFR) program as part of substantial spending cuts, but it is not predicted to be enough to stop the state's debt rising to $43.8 billion by 2020.
WA's budget is predicted to be $2.3 billion in the red this financial year, with deficits above $1 billion predicted each year until a forecast return to surplus in 2020-21.

Premier Mark McGowan insisted revenue write-downs had left him with no choice but to break his pre-election pledge not to increase taxes, lifting payroll tax on companies paying employees more than $100 million per year.
"We are sorry about that, I am sorry; it hasn't been easy," he said.
Companies paying employees between $100 million and $1.5 billion will see their payroll tax rise to 6 per cent, while those above that level will pay 6.5 per cent — although the Government insisted that the rise would only last for five years.
The hike is expected to impact around 1,300 businesses operating in WA and raise $435 million over four years in the process.
Mr Wyatt announced 3,000 voluntary public sector redundancies to would deliver a saving of more than $300 million, but he insisted this would not impact frontline services.
Meanwhile, in a move sure to spark a backlash from the mining industry, gold producers will face much higher royalty charges in a move designed to raise nearly $400 million over four years.

The Government has also risked angering regional WA by shifting hundreds of millions of dollars in regular expenditure into the Royalties for Regions fund.
That means instead of funding additional regional projects as it was initially designed to, RFR will now be used to pay for ongoing costs related to health, water, sewerage and Labor's election commitments.
Households have been spared from further direct pain, after significant hikes to fees and charges were announced earlier this year.
Mr McGowan said the budget was an effort to get WA's finances back onto a sustainable footing after years of multibillion-dollar deficits, including a record $3 billion deficit last year.
"It's about striking the right balance between delivering on our election promises, creating new jobs and getting the state's finances back onto a sustainable direction," he said.
"I wanted to protect struggling families, and small and medium businesses."
WA Opposition Leader Mike Nahan labelled it "a budget of betrayal".
"The McGowan Government promised not to increase taxes or add new taxes," Dr Nahan said. "They add a billion dollars worth of taxes.
"He also promised not to reduce frontline services and there are substantial reductions … he also promised to reduce debt. Debt goes up by 30 per cent."
A new gambling tax will be brought in, affecting internet-based bookmakers who have avoided the same levies as the TAB by basing themselves in other jurisdictions.

But the Government could face challenges getting that and other revenue-raising measures through Parliament, due to its lack of a majority in the Upper House.

Chamber of Minerals and Energy WA chief executive Nicole Roocke said the gold royalty hike was a "slap in the face".

"The increase in royalties will be detrimental to the sector at the point in time when we're starting to see green shoots emerge," Ms Roocke said.
"There is the real potential that they'll be job cuts as a result."
Association of Mining and Exploration Companies acting CEO Graham Short also said the move would have "significant and social consequences".
"It's quite clearly a cash grab … [it is] short-sighted and to be honest quite baffling," he said.
Chamber of Commerce and Industry CEO Deidre Willmott said the payroll tax fallout would flow through the entire economy.
"There will be an impact on jobs … these increases are targeted at the largest employers so their employees will be affected," she said.




Energy company Santos has agreed to supply gas to 330,000 Australian east coast homes over the next two years rather than export it.
Santos and its GLNG partners announced they would sell 30 petajoules (PJ) of gas to east coast customers including electricity companies next year and in 2019.
Santos managing director Kevin Gallagher said that the gas would otherwise have been exported as LNG.
"Over the last few months Santos has been working constructively with the Federal Government and our GLNG partners to supply additional gas to the east coast domestic market," he said.
"Thirty PJ is a material volume of gas which would power a 228-megawatt power station or 330,000 homes over the two-year period."
The announcement follows a Federal Government decision earlier in the year to restrict gas exports, in a bid to counter domestic shortages which have been pushing prices higher in Australia, and in turn affecting power generation.
Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull did not specify how much impact export controls were likely to have on prices, but said wholesale prices fell after the federal decision was taken.
Mr Turnbull argued it would be unacceptable for Australia to become the largest global exporter of LNG but have a shortage of east coast domestic market gas.
Mr Gallagher said the decision taken by Santos was further proof of its readiness to respond to market dynamics and meet local gas demand.
"We are committed to improving energy reliability and affordability for all Australians, both householders and industry," he said.
Santos earlier decided to deliver up to 72 PJ of gas over four years into the south-east market through a swap agreement and sale of 15 PJ to the Pelican Point power station in Adelaide.


Fans attending Adelaide Oval for the first AFL qualifying final tonight will face a challenge if they're wanting to pay with cash for food and drinks inside the taxpayer-funded stadium.
The oval this year converted a large number of outlets to only accept card payments.
It's a move Adelaide Oval Stadium Management Authority (AOSMA) general manager Darren Chandler said was all about faster service and followed a trial for card-only outlets during the 2016-17 cricket season.
"The trial was well received, particularly by those seeking a faster speed of service and for the growing number of patrons who do not want to carry cash," he said.
"Approximately two-thirds of our outlets are [now] card-only, which is slightly behind buying behaviour where card transactions sit at around 87 per cent."
Adelaide Oval has a busy weekend of football finals, starting with tonight's clash between the Adelaide Crows and Greater Western Sydney.
Port Adelaide Power take on the West Coast Eagles on Saturday night, while on Sunday Sturt will play Central District in the SANFL semi-finals and Woodville-West Torrens will play the Port Adelaide Magpies.
Patrons have reported having to walk a long way to find a cash outlet.
The oval also offers a small number of booths where patrons can exchange cash for a food and beverage cash card, but they are an added inconvenience for those trying to get fed and watered and return to their seats in the rush between quarters.
Australian Privacy Foundation chairman David Vaile said card-only payment systems in general were a "straight-out" attack on anonymous payments.
"There's the old furphy, 'if you've got nothing to hide then you have nothing to fear'. It's complete nonsense," Mr Vaile said.
"You've obviously got something to hide — PINs, bank details — and it's not because you're criminal but because you're sensible."

Crows supporter Sam Auld is a regular visitor to Adelaide Oval and suggested the stalls might lose business from time-poor punters as a result of card-only systems.
"Many people wouldn't want their partners knowing how many drinks they buy and how much they spend. It's easily avoided with cash," he said.
"It's all about cost saving for them; no tills to count, less chance of mistakes and theft, and payWave is faster than cash."
Mr Chandler said all credit and debit cards were accepted and transaction fees were absorbed by AOSMA. The cash exchange cards incurred no fees and could be reimbursed in full at any time.
He said he did not consider the system to be a threat to consumer privacy.
"Consumer behaviour is trending this way and it's all a part of our approach to keep up with consumer demands and provide a faster service for patrons."
Mr Vaile said commercial transactions had not been an obvious government surveillance mechanism in the past because the effort required was intrusive and largely unjustifiable.
"But with the increased reach of the real-time financial tracking systems, at some stage it may become accessible without a warrant," he said.
"There's a problem in that the bar is constantly being lowered and the capacity [for tracking] is being raised."
Mr Vaile added that people often did not realise that it was not just about them.
"If, for instance, you're tied to a particular transaction to a particular venue and other people turn up in the same place, that enables network analysis.
"You were there with your mates. It might not be a big deal, but on the other hand it is becoming increasingly difficult to protect that information."
He said there was a global push to recognise that anonymity was a legal right and the "starting point" for privacy protection.



How would you feel boarding a plane that you knew was headed straight into the eye of one of the most powerful Atlantic storms in a century?
With Hurricane Irma hovering ominously off the coast of Puerto Rico, most flights were turning around.
But not this one.
Delta flight 431 decided to go it alone, racing from New York's JFK airport directly into the path of the storm for its destination: San Juan.
Aviation reporter Jason Rabinowitz tracked the tricky flight using FlightRadar24 and provided live commentary on Twitter.


With windspeeds on the ground picking up, the race was on to get a full flight to its destination on time.

Squeezing its way through the outskirts of the hurricane, flight 341 had a tricky landing ahead.
But they were prepared.
According to Delta, flight 431 arrived safely at 12:01pm (local time) to light rain. It recorded winds around 24 knots with gusts up to 31 knots — all these conditions are below safe operating limits for the 737-900ER.

Having made it through the storm, the pilot, crew and ground staff had yet another challenge ahead of them: unload all passengers and luggage, clean the aircraft, board a plane full of new passengers and get out of San Juan before Irma unleashed her worst on the Puerto Rican capital.
The plane managed a tight turnaround, with Delta recording flight 302 (the same aircraft's return journey) departing San Juan at 12:41pm — just 40 minutes after it landed.
There were 173 passengers on board.
Conditions were ramping up as the aircraft left San Juan, with winds buffeting trees at the airport and dark clouds hanging overhead.


The flight stuck to a gap between the hurricane's outer rain band and the centre of the storm to find open sky.

After clearing the hurricane, it was smooth sailing back to JFK, with the flight landing 39 minutes ahead of schedule.
Delta released a statement later on Wednesday praising its meteorology team as "the best in the business".
"They took a hard look at the weather data and the track of the storm and worked with the flight crew and dispatcher to agree it was safe to operate the flight," company vice-president Erik Snell said.
"And our flight and ground crews were incredible in their effort to turn the aircraft quickly and safely so the flight could depart well before the hurricane threat."


The impact of low wages and high household debt appear to have taken their toll on Australia's retailers, with a further slowdown in sales in July.

In seasonally adjusted terms retail sales were stagnant, having eased back from a moribund 0.2 per cent growth in June.
The market wasn't expecting much, but had pencilled in around 0.3 per cent growth into its forecasts.
A number of key sectors —particularly in discretionary retailing — reported shrinking sales.
Where growth was reported, it was still fairly weak.
The largest falls were recorded in New South Wales (-0.4 per cent), South Australia (-0.8 per cent), Tasmania (-0.9 per cent) and the Northern Territory (-0.1 per cent), while consumers in Queensland and Victoria were prepared to lash out more.

The stronger annual growth of 3.6 per cent has been supported by a spurt in March and April, driven by post-Cyclone Debbie rebuilding.
RBC's Su-Lin Ong says Australian consumers are feeling the pinch and are likely to keep their wallets shut for some time as utility prices rise and squeeze disposable incomes.
"A large increase in utility prices [15-20 per cent] came into effect from 1 July and may have tempered expenditure in the month," Ms Ong said.
"We suspect that the hit to household disposable income from higher electricity and gas prices has yet to fully feed through and we would not be surprised to see further weakness in retail sales ahead."
ANZ's Jo Masters said the weakness in sales was concentrated in small firms, which tend to have a more volatile cycle.
"Softening retail sales is consistent with our view that households will struggle to sustain consumption growth above income growth — particularly given weak wage growth and high levels of household debt — and we continue to see the consumer as a key risk to the economic outlook," Ms Masters said.
Trade figures also softened in July with the trade surplus tumbling to just $460 million, down from $888 million in the previous month.
The market had expected a surplus closer to $1 billion, however weaker than expected shipments of key commodities coal, iron ore and gold dragged exports down 2 per cent — outpacing the 1 per cent fall in imports.
The surplus has narrowed for three consecutive months and is now down about 90 per cent from its peak of $4.6 billion in December last year.
Coal exports fell 2.2 per cent over the month, while iron was down 1.8 per cent — largely due to weaker prices.

Falling prices also drove LNG exports down a surprising 12.4 per cent after several strong months of growth.
Rural goods bucked the trend, up 2 per cent, with particularly strong performances from wool (+26 per cent), although cereal exports were down 13 per cent.
Services exports — in particular tourism — were significant contributors to the surplus.
"Tourism exports rose by 3.4 per cent while imports [money spent by Australian residents offshore] inched up by 0.6 per cent," CBA's Gareth Aird noted.
"As yet, the higher Australian dollar hasn't had a negative impact on the tourism trade balance," he said.
JP Morgan's Ben Jarman said the overall trade retreat may be temporary.
"The export data are likely to pick up again as higher market commodity prices transmit to the official trade receipts, and as LNG capacity picks up further," he said.



Low-paid, unskilled workers who rely on the gig economy to make a living are missing out on mandatory employer superannuation, according to Australia's peak super body.

The Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia (ASFA) wants the current compulsory superannuation system overhauled to ensure workers employed by the likes of Uber, Deliveroo and Airtasker can build retirement nest eggs.
ASFA wants current rules changed, where workers earning less than $450 in a calendar month are not entitled to the compulsory employer contribution.
Chief executive Martin Fahy warns the rapid growth of the gig economy means many independent contractors are being disadvantaged and, in some cases, exploited by unscrupulous employers.
"Workers who already operate under some form of independent work arrangement, such as independent contractors, will migrate onto web-based platforms and new gig economy jobs will be created," Dr Fahy said.
"The case for change is strong. In the absence of any policy reforms, a growing gig economy would mean lower superannuation balances at retirement.
"This would reduce the broader adequacy of the superannuation and retirement income system."
ASFA estimates there are around 100,000 workers — or 0.8 per cent of the workforce — who make their living from web-based platforms such as Uber, Deliveroo and Airtasker are potentially disadvantaged by missing out on compulsory superannuation payments.

Research by ASFA also warns about "sham contracting", where dodgy employers disguise an employment arrangement as "independent contracting" to avoid responsibility to pay the superannuation guarantee.
Dr Fahy said the rise of the gig economy means compulsory superannuation regulations need to be revamped to cover self-employed workers who might make their living from a number of jobs.

"This is particularly relevant for people who work sporadically and are on low incomes, but also for those who work in the gig economy as a second job," Dr Fahy said.
"Workers who inhabit this legal 'grey area' are showing growth in worker numbers. This issue will only become more prevalent."
ASFA has released a discussion paper examining the superannuation and retirement risks for workers in the gig economy.
In the paper, ASFA says almost a quarter of self-employed workers have no superannuation, with women more disadvantaged than men.

A surprise move by President Donald Trump boosted sentiment on Wall Street, which is expected to flow through to the Australian share market.

Most US sectors posted gains, with energy stocks being the best performers thanks to an overnight boost in oil prices.
Risk aversion over North Korea's recent missile tests has also worn off as gold prices retreated from their one-year highs.
Furthermore, the Australian dollar has risen slightly to hit the 80 US cent mark again.
President Trump ignored the advice of his fellow Republicans by backing the Democrats to support a deal which would extend the US debt ceiling until December 15, avoid a government shutdown and provide disaster relief for victims of Tropical Storm Harvey.
"We had a very good meeting with [House minority leader] Nancy Pelosi and [Senate minority leader] Chuck Schumer," the President said on Wednesday.
"We agreed to a three-month extension on debt ceiling, which they consider to be sacred, very important."
Earlier in the day, House speaker Paul Ryan said the Democratic proposal for a three-month increase was "ridiculous and disgraceful", and would "play politics with the debt ceiling".
The Federal Reserve also released the findings of its latest report on the US economy, the Beige Book.
It showed that the US economy grew at a modest to moderate pace in July through mid-August, but inflation remained slight.
"Prices rose modestly overall across the country," the Fed said in its Beige Book. This data was compiled from anecdotal evidence, sourced from business contacts across the US.
The inflation data prompted Fed governor Lael Brainard's comments on Tuesday — that the central bank should hold off on a rate hike until it is confident that the weak readings will rebound.
In addition, Fed vice-chairman Stanley Fischer has resigned, effective in mid-October, citing "personal reasons".
Mr Fischer was appointed by former President Barack Obama in 2014, and his term was due to end in June 2018.
His sooner-than-expected departure will allow President Trump scope to begin reshaping the leadership of the Fed, which may affect the longer-term outlook for US monetary policy.
Australian shares are expected to open higher, according to ASX futures which have risen by 0.3 per cent.
But the local market may be affected by some economic figures that the Bureau of Statistics will release this morning — July retail sales and trade balance (which is the difference in value between Australia's imports and exports).
Retail sales are expected to increase by 0.3 per cent, according to economists polled by .
However, two of the big four banks are not as optimistic.
ANZ's prediction is that retail sales will rise by 0.3 per cent, while NAB economists are forecasting "tepid 0.1 per cent growth".
The market consensus is that Australia's trade balance will come in at $1 billion.
"Little change in commodity prices in the month should see the trade balance print a surplus of around $850 million," noted Deutsche Bank strategist Ken Crompton.
"But NAB economists are more optimistic and have pencilled in a $1.5 billion outcome thanks to higher prices in bulk commodities and solid demand from China," NAB's foreign exchange strategist Rodrigo Catril wrote.


A daily morning look at the financial stories you need to know to start the day.
STOCKS/ECONOMY
-Stock futures are flat after Monday's losses. We get August new home sales and consumer confidence numbers this morning.
OBAMACARE REPLACEMENT
-Senator Susan Collins says she will vote no on the Graham-Cassidy Obamacare replacement bill, meaning it will likely not pass.
PUERTO RICO EMERGENCY
-The rescue effort is picking up on Puerto Rico as power, food, and water are still scarce. President Trump is also reminding the country that Puerto Rico still has massive debts.


The Federal Reserve's plan to methodically raise short-term interest rates over the next couple years may not boost bank shares, contrary to popular belief, and could instead hurt the group's profitability as it flattens the so-called yield curve, Deutsche Bank said.
Analyst Matt O'Connor downgraded shares of JPMorgan and regional bank PNC Financial late Monday to hold from buy for this reason. The yield curve is the difference between short term and long-term rates in the Treasury market and often runs parallel to the margin banks make on their loans.
"We continue to believe the yield curve will flatten as the Fed continues to boost short term rates, the unwind of the Fed's bond book isn't likely to meaningfully impact the demand/supply of those assets, and economic growth seems unlikely to significantly accelerate (for a sustained period)," wrote O'Connor. "In this environment, net interest income growth is likely to slow and credit costs may begin to inch up."
JPMorgan shares rose more than 40 percent the last 12 months, more than the 33 percent gain for the Financial Select SPDR, as CEO Jamie Dimon guided the bank through a difficult trading environment on Wall Street. Bank shares have perked up again recently as the Fed indicated a December hike was likely and traders bet the move would boost both short term and long term rates, making the industry's lending portfolios more profitable. Deutsche Bank disagrees, apparently.
JPMorgan fell slightly in premarket trading following the Deutsche call.
"Increased competition in investment banking/trading may erode some of JPM's recent gains," wrote the analyst. "Post crisis (including in recent years), JPM has gained large market share across its investment bank (IB fees, FICC and EQ trading). However, the competitive landscape seems to have increased and even JPM mgmt (at its 2017 investor day) has acknowledged it will be difficult to maintain share."
PNC has done even better than JPMorgan, up 52 percent in one year. But that run has made the Pittsburgh-based bank too expensive.
"PNC shares now trade at 14.4 times 2018 consensus or a 10% premium to the Large Regional peer group. This compares to a 5% discount on average over both the historical 25-year and 5-year time horizon. Some premium is warranted in our view given the positives noted above, but further multiple expansion seems harder to argue for and we're less positive on Large Regional banks in general given concerns surrounding a flatter yield curve," stated the note.
Deutsche still thinks factors such as loosening regulation and M&A activity can help the financial sector, but it favors "turnaround" stories such as Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo than the sector leaders. O'Connor also has a buy rating on Morgan Stanley.


Large-cap technology shares including the FANG basket crushed the market this year and drove hedge fund performance. But with the technology stalwarts faltering, what does that mean for the stock market?
"Some FANG stocks such as Amazon and Google/Alphabet have seen weakness before but usually it's been company-specific and not broad-based. Typically, Facebook and Netflix have held firm. Not today. Something looks to have changed," Fred Hickey, editor of High Tech Strategist, wrote in an email Monday.Facebook shares declined 4.5 percent on Monday, its worst day since November. The drop followed the disclosure last week that the social media company will share information with Congress about suspected Russian-linked election ads.
Netflix shares fell 4.7 percent on Monday after a report that 21st Century Fox is adding more inventory to its FX+ streaming service. Investors may be concerned that content owners are pulling more content from the streaming giant.
It's not just FANG — Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google-parent Alphabet. Apple has lost approximately $50 billion in market value since the company announced its latest line of products on Sept. 12 as investors worry over the strength of the new iPhone models' "super cycle."
Hickey believes it is not just fundamental news driving the sector lower, but it could be a reaction to the Federal Reserve's announcement Wednesday to roll off its $4.5 trillion balance sheet.
"When the QEs were announced by the Fed, stocks jumped across the board before the actual buying occurred. We may be seeing the reverse happen following Wednesday's Fed meeting when they announced QT [quantitative tapering]," he wrote.
So what does a falling technology sector mean for the S&P 500?
Using Kensho, a hedge fund analytics tool, we looked at what happens to the market during periods when the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK) fell 5 percent or more in one month since the beginning of the bull market.

Since March 2009, a weak month for the technology sector is generally bad news for the market, according to Kensho. The study found the S&P 500 declined 17 times out of 18 instances the fund fell 5 percent or more in one month.
Bottom line: When tech stocks are falling, it's been nearly impossible during this bull market for the S&P 500 to post a gain without them participating.
Technology shares, along with industrial and consumer discretionary stocks, share the highest correlation with the market.

Despite the recent declines, the FANG stocks are still doing well on a year-to-date basis with Facebook up 42 percent, Amazon up 25 percent, Netflix up 44 percent and Alphabet up 18 percent through Monday versus the S&P 500's 12 percent return.
However, the big tech gains may be a sign of earlier excessive risk-taking by investors, which could mean a large reversal when the tide turns.


Oh man, it's happening again. Oil is rallying, and so are oil stocks. Both are up about 10 percent in a month.
And almost no one thinks it will last.
Here's the story this time: Oil supply is tightening. OPEC compliance with production levels has increased. The shale guys have increased activity, but not as much as some feared, and demand numbers have been steadily on the increase.
The result: a big oil rally, with Anadarko, Marathon, Hess, Devon, and Apache up double digits this month, and even Exxon and Chevron up 6 percent and 9 percent, respectively, both among the leaders of the Dow Jones industrial average for the month
Refiners like Holly, Valero and Phillips 66 have hit new highs as well.
We'll see. The whole energy story this year follows one heartbreak after another, and investors don't want anything to do with this sector.
Who could blame them? On at least three occasions, investors have had their heads handed to them, and we may now have a fourth heartbreak. Let me explain.
The first big energy rally occurred at the election, when energy stocks climbed 10 percent into the first weeks of December. The sector was far better than the 5 percent rally in the S&P 500 at the time.
But oil stocks were already off their highs as we entered the new year. They dropped steadily for the first two months of the year and accelerated their decline when oil dropped below $50 in March. They fell 12 percent from their highs, giving back all their postelection gains. That was the first heartbreak.
The second began when oil rallied in late March, going to almost $54 by mid-April, and investors again began buying oil stocks, pushing them up 6 percent in a month.
But it didn't last — oil resumed its slide and was again below $45 by early May and down to $42 in late June. The Energy Select Sector SPDR, the XLE, went almost straight down, losing 12 percent.
Then came the third heartbreak. A six-week rally took oil to $50 by early August, and oil stocks rose 6 percent, but again they gave it all back when oil dropped into the mid-$40s.
You'd think everyone would give up by now. But oil rallied 10 percent this month to its highest level since April, and we get the biggest oil stock rally of the year. The XLE is up 10 percent in a little more than a month.
Is the fourth heartbreak coming? Who knows. Looks to me like it's a rally based on fundamentals — so far. Investor sentiment is about as bad as you could ask for. There's little money in the sector, and that is certainly a plus. The energy weighting in the S&P 500 is 7 percent. It hasn't been that low in more than a decade.
So once again, the analysts are saying, you have some fundamental improvement, and you've got a lot of cheap stocks here. Anyone interested?
Anyone?


There's one classic market theory that could predict exactly when the next correction will occur.
Todd Gordon, founder of TradingAnalysis.com, says that the "Elliott wave" theory shows that while the S&P 500 has more room to rally, it will ultimately fall once it reaches a certain level. The framework, invented by Ralph Nelson Elliott, posits that each bull market rally goes through five different "waves" before a pullback occurs, with the first, third, and fifth waves moving upward while pullbacks happen in the second and fourth waves.
According to Gordon, the market is currently in that fifth and final upward wave. While the S&P 500 continues to climb, as it did in the first and third waves, once it finishes its current "trend channel," the market will begin to fall.
"At the current angle of ascent, I'm not calling a top [in the short term]," he said Monday on CNBC's "Trading Nation." "We could have a bit more of a rally, potentially reaching the 3,000 mark in the S&P 500."

That would represent a 20 percent rise from Monday's closing price.
Once the S&P does reach 3,000 the index could be set to come crashing down to 1,800, Gordon said. That would represent a 40 percent drop from those peaks.

"I think we stay long for now, but we need to be very aware that we are in distribution phase for this massive five-wave stock market rally," Gordon said.
The S&P 500 fell modestly Monday, dragged down by a drop in big tech stocks.

As the Senate tries yet again to repeal and replace Obamacare and President Donald Trump tweet-blasts the National Football League, CNBC's Jim Cramer wonders who wants tax reform less.
"The White House seems like it still hasn't figured out what rates it wants, let alone what could possibly pass. They might as well be working from two different countries to solve the tax issue, and it's incredibly clear that Congress can't possibly tackle two things at once," the "Mad Money" host said on Monday. "Getting tax reform done in September turns out to be a pipe dream."
Cramer said it would be "fanciful" to think that the so-called Big Six — House Speaker Paul Ryan, Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn — could agree on much in the way of taxes.
Even as Republicans reportedly plan to release a tax reform framework this week, still-unresolved between the six leaders of the GOP-led tax overhaul are matters of expensing, effective tax rates for the country's richest households and how to fund the cuts.
Cramer likened the Republicans' situation to the Obama administration's efforts to reform the tax system. As long as former President Barack Obama pushed an issue on which all Republicans and a few Democrats didn't agree, any related legislation became a non-starter.
Now, all Democrats and a few Republicans don't agree on either health care or tax policy, a recipe for disaster when it comes to reform, the "Mad Money" host said.
"You simply can't pass a major piece of legislation in this country unless both the president and Congress are focused on it," Cramer said. "Right now, it feels like nobody's focused on tax reform, with the president more concerned about the national anthem, the NFL, and the ratings for football games."

Cramer pointed to the irony of CNN hosting a debate on health care reform Monday evening at the same time as the Cardinals-Cowboys football game.
More people will be focused on the players who kneel during the national anthem or get criticized by outspoken Cowboys owner Jerry Jones than on the problems Republicans are grappling with when it comes to health care, Cramer said.
"So September comes to a close and nothing of substance has been done in Washington," Cramer said. "It's the ultimate do-nothing Congress, and now we've also got a do-nothing White House, at least until the president stops acting like a sports talk radio personality. In short, if you were hoping for tax reform from this government, all I can say is don't hold your breath."


Sometimes, there are days like Monday, when CNBC's Jim Cramer sees the stock market's "rocket ships" fly too close to the sun.
"We actually had two rocket ships at work today: FANG and 'Rocket Man' himself, Kim Jong-Un, a nuclear menace who's now become the short-sellers' best friend, this time with his pronouncement that our flyovers of North Korea amount to a declaration of war," the "Mad Money" host said.
While FANG, Cramer's acronym for the stocks of Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google, now Alphabet, may have fallen out of favor with investors for climbing too much of late, some more uncommon stocks started to rally ahead of North Korea's latest statements.
For example, General Motors, an inexpensive stock that was hit hard in August by falling sales, rose to new highs today after Deutsche Bank analysts raised the stock's rating to "buy" from "hold," citing the automaker's highly competitive position in the development of self-driving cars.
Cramer found that the market, in turning away from the high-flying tech stocks for fear of overvaluation, is seeking out undervalued names like General Motors instead.
"The contrast was stark between the cheap stocks that managed to work their way higher [on Monday] and the more expensive stocks that got pulled back to earth by the gravitational pull of this high-valuation sell-off," he said. "Each winner has an individual reason for winning. All the losers suffered a uniform fate regardless of the news flow."
Market-watchers could argue that shares of Verizon and AT&T gained momentum on Monday because of their large dividends, which would provide investors with a stable income in the face of geopolitical turmoil.
But with T-Mobile and Sprint in talks to merge, a combination that would create three large telecom companies instead of four, phone bills could rise, meaning Verizon and AT&T could stand to make more money, Cramer said.
The "Mad Money" host also turned to the widely disliked retail sector, in which many players are struggling to stay afloat as online giants like Amazon encroach on brick-and-mortar business.
"Consider a stock like TJX [Companies], which soared today simply because it's been too unloved. Why not? Sometimes an unloved stock can become loved if it surprises to the upside, and that's exactly what one of my favorite analysts, Matthew Boss of JPMorgan, says will happen when TJX reports, which is why it's one of my charitable trust's biggest positions," Cramer said.
As for the day's losers, Cramer figured the negativity was mostly relative. Facebook's involvement in Congress' investigation into the 2016 election could have been enough for some investors to want to sell, he said. Amazon regularly comes under fire for being overvalued. Netflix's valuation is difficult to pinpoint and often in the eye of the beholder.
"If you look through the old news clips, they're filled with premature obituaries of FANG. Every one has been incredibly cogent. Every one's been wrong," Cramer said. "That's why I like to keep one foot in the rocket ship and another on earth."
Cramer added that when his favorite high-flyers get pummeled, he often finds them more attractive than when they rally to the stratosphere.
"Today was all about profit-taking in the winners and a love of the losers and I don't think that much more," the "Mad Money" host said. "Own some of both in a portfolio that's diversified not just by sector, but by riskiness, and I think you'll do just fine."


Move over David Bowie. The brothers who brought the world Eminem are trying to cash in by selling up to $50 million shares in a startup that makes money off the hip-hop artist's music collection, including  "Lose Yourself" and "The Real Slim Shady."
The startup, Royalty Flow, filed an offering at the Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday, outlining plans for a "mini-IPO."
Royalty Flow is selling a little more than 3.3 million shares to the public for $15 each, with a minimum investment of $2,250. It also aims to list on the Nasdaq. It will use the proceeds from the IPO to buy as much as 25 percent of Eminem music royalty rights from Jeff and Mark Bass, the Detroit-area producers who took on Eminem in his early days. Eventually the company plans to acquire more royalty rights.
The IPO could net the Bass brothers as much as $18.7 million.
"The music industry is booming," said Mike Smith, the CEO of Royalty Exchange, the company that is rolling out Royalty Flow, in an interview on CNBC's "Closing Bell." "Unfortunately for investors there aren't very  many ways they can participate directly in this. So that's why we're doing this. To give people direct exposure."
It would be just the latest example of a crowdfunded IPO under five-year-old rules allowing small companies to raise capital from regular investors. Prior to these rules, startups and young companies looking for money had to shop themselves around to private funds or affluent individuals who met certain income and net worth criteria.
Chicken Soup for the Soul Entertainment listed on Nasdaq last month after its own $30 million crowdfunded IPO, which it billed as the largest yet.
David Bowie turned heads on Wall Street 20 years ago when he packaged up rights to some 300 of his recordings and sold them in a $55 million bond to Prudential Insurance Company of America. The "Bowie bond" paid a 7.9 percent annual rate over 10 years backed by the income from his royalties and record sales.
It was the first in what was to become one of the stranger corners of finance, where bankers managed to create bonds and other securities for a host of cash-generating businesses, including billboard rentals, film libraries and restaurant franchises, selling them to specialty hedge funds and other professional investors.
The Royalty Flow IPO could be the first music royalty-backed security open directly to ordinary people on an exchange. But the music streaming company Spotify is exploring a direct listing, which could come later this year or early next year.
Royalty Flow is calling itself an emerging growth company. Its plan to focus on music rights that generate 8 percent to 16 percent annual returns and eventually branch out to movie, television and trademark rights. It will pay investors dividends based on those returns.
Eminem, whose real name is Marshall Mathers, sold over 172 million records worldwide. The royalties earned by the portion of his catalog being acquired grew 43 percent from 2015 to 2016, according to the offering document. Streaming was 46 percent of royalties earned last year.


Shares of offshore drilling and services companies surged on Monday after UBS upgraded several stocks in the space and as oil prices hit multi-month highs.
Transocean's stock jumped 7 percent to nearly $10. Shares of Diamond Offshore were up about 6.5 percent, above $14 share. Noble Corporation rose 10.8 percent to trade above $4.50. Ensco International cracked $5.50 per share, up 6.9 percent. Rowan Companies tacked on 3.4 percent to trade at nearly $12.
UBS raised its price targets for offshore drilling equipment providers, pointing to signs of improving demand for oil rigs and stabilization in the sector. The bank's view that oil prices will normalize in 2020 and 2021, as well as measures taken to push out debt payments, bolsters the case for the companies, analysts said in a research note released on Monday.
"We conservatively assumed oil prices in the high-$50's to low-$60's by 2020 (below UBS estimate of $67/bbl WTI). However, if oil prices retrench to below $50/bbl and remain at those levels into 2020 financial risk exists given levered balance sheets," UBS said.
On Monday, Brent crude prices rose above $58 to the highest level in more than two years, while U.S. crude topped $51 a barrel for the first time in four months.
UBS sees utilization for drill ships and jack-up rigs improving slightly next year, followed by greater demand growth in 2019 and 2020. Three years of weak oil prices have weighed on demand for offshore drilling services.
Steady utilization rates and growing rig demand for existing wells are offsetting the expiration of long-term contracts, the bank said.
"However, for the sector to truly tighten exploration (or greenfield) drilling would need to return which would only begin to occur with oil prices in the high-$50 to low-$60s," the analysts wrote.
UBS raised its forecasts for 2018 earnings before certain expenses in the space by about 25 percent. While the new stock price targets are still below recent 52-week highs, UBS analysts said they believe there is 15 percent to 60 percent upside to those targets.
Shares of offshore drillers were down about 80 percent from highs reached in 2013 and 2014, but have risen about 25 percent from those lows in the last month, UBS noted.


Gold surged Monday after North Korea's foreign minister accused President Donald Trump of declaring war.

Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho told reporters in New York the alleged declaration gives North Korea the right to strike back. Actions could include shooting down U.S. bombers, he said, even when they are not inside the North Korean airspace.
Gold futures for December delivery rose 1.09 percent on the news at $1,311.70 an ounce following the foreign minister's comments. They were trading down by about 0.05 percent beforehand.


The price of bitcoin rose sharply on Monday with its price spiking up 7 percent midday, according to CoinDesk market data.
The price of the cryptocurrency is up nearly 300 percent year to date.

Bitcoin is still under the $4,000 level, which it broke through after JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said on Sept. 12 that the cryptocurrency is a "fraud" that will eventually blow up.
In addition, recent reports said regulators in China have ordered bitcoin exchanges to close hurt the digital currency's price.
"In my opinion, the markets overreacted to the China news. In the short term, it was bad news, but long term the fundamentals are unchanged," William Mougayar, author of "The Business Blockchain," wrote in an email.

Here's a bright and booming sector within retail.
Off-price retailers — TJ Maxx owner TJX, Ross Stores and Burlington — are expected to see incremental sales growth of $18 billion to $19 billion by 2021, according to JPMorgan. And that boost will primarily stem from the demise of department store chains, analyst Matthew Boss wrote in a Monday note to clients.
"We expect off-price will be the primary beneficiary of this brick & mortar sales volume up for grabs and benefit from the plethora of close-out merchandise for several years," Boss said.
And when it comes to the growing threat of Amazon, the Street shouldn't be worried about off-price players losing market share, Boss added.
Shares of Ross Stores were climbing more than 3 percent Monday, following JPMorgan's report.
TJX's stock was up more than 1 percent, while shares of Burlington were up close to 2.5 percent on the day. Burlington has been the biggest gainer of the three of late, having climbed more than 8 percent in 2017.
Here's the argument for off-price retail: Amazon's encroachment into the apparel industry more closely resembles a full-price department store, instead of a Ross or TJ Maxx model, JPMorgan's Boss said. He cited the internet giant's Prime Wardrobe pricing structure as an example, saying the fashion focus at Amazon instead looks to mirror companies like Macy's and J.C. Penney.
Since 2011, department stores have lost roughly $25 billion in sales on a combined basis, and are on pace to lose another $22 billion in sales over the next five years, should the downward trend continue, JPMorgan found.
Off-price retailers, on the other hand, have gained $14 billion since 2011, the firm said.
JPMorgan has upgraded Ross Stores to overweight, giving the stock a fresh price target of $74 per share, up from $65. The stock was trading near $63 per share Monday morning.
An important point to also be made is just how difficult the off-price model — offering a treasure-hunt type experience — would be for Amazon to copy online, Boss emphasized in his report. He cites "high barriers to entry" to tapping into the concept successfully.
"The model is difficult to replicate with over 1,000 buyers worldwide currently sourcing from 18,000 vendors in 100+ countries," he said.
Ross Stores' management team has also stepped up defending its turf.
"If I was Amazon, I don't think I'd be looking at the off-price space as my big opportunity," Ross Stores chief operating officer, Michael O'Sullivan, said at an investor conference earlier this month.
"I think within the world of retail, especially given the economics ... I don't think off-price is really the place where I'd focus my energy," O'Sullivan added about Amazon. "Doing a treasure hunt online is much more hit or miss, because you are not actually seeing — or you're seeing it, you're just not experiencing the product in a same way that you would if you were in a store."
Amazon didn't immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.
At a time when many retailers are shuttering stores to get back to a "healthy" footprint, off-price companies have plans to open more doors in the years ahead. TJX even recently rolled out an entirely new nameplate, Homesense, in the United States.
JPMorgan has called out Ross' long-term store target of 2,500 locations as being "conservative."
"The growth runway for ROST is well beyond 10 years," he said, adding that — based on meetings with Ross' management team — JPMorgan believes real estate landlords are more willing to partner with Ross today, especially given the "fall-out" in the sporting goods and office space.
Ross Stores, TJX and Burlington are each forecasting same-store sales growth to close out the year — not something many retailers can promise in such a volatile market today.


Shares in meal kit delivery service Blue Apron rose 3 percent Monday after an upgraded 'buy' rating from Guggenheim.
Blue Apron leads the meal kit delivery service sector, which the rating firm estimates will grow at a rate of 25 percent to $10 billion in the next 3 years, according to a note released Monday.
Blue Apron controls approximately 20 percent of the market share for the sector, the note said.
"Given their proof of concept and evolving management strategy, we think they can effectively compete and sustain the brand's leadership position," Guggenheim said.
Before the open Monday shares of Blue Apron were trading around $5.34.



General Motors' strong competitive position in autonomous vehicle (AV) technology is widely underestimated by investors, according to a Wall Street firm.
Deutsche Bank raised its rating on the automaker's shares to buy from hold, saying the company will attain a large market share of the new AV market.
"GM's AV's will be ready for commercial deployment, without human drivers, much sooner than widely expected (within quarters, not years), and potentially years ahead of competitors," analyst Rod Lache wrote in a note to clients Sunday. "We believe that businesses built off of this platform will ramp much faster than is widely expected. A fast ramp could perpetuate sustainable advantages. And we believe that this will be material, even to a company of GM's size."
Shares of General Motors, incorporated in 1908, are up 13 percent year to date through Friday compared with the S&P 500's 12 percent return. Lache raised his price target for General Motors shares to $51 from $36, representing 29 percent upside from Friday's close.
The analyst has just a hold rating on the more popular car of the future play on Wall Street, Tesla.
Lache estimates up to 60 percent of U.S. households in cities may find it better to use autonomous vehicle services instead of owning a car. He forecasts more than 2 percent of U.S. miles driven in 2025 will be through "autonomous on demand mobility" offerings, then rising to 10 percent share by 2030.
Lache believes General Motors can attain 17.5 percent share of the market. He cited how the company has said the autonomous vehicle and mobility business could be a potential $7 trillion global market.
"This is a massive market opportunity," he wrote. "The monetization model is recurring in nature (vs. the transactional/cyclical model that automakers live in today), and likely to receive a healthy valuation."
The analyst predicts General Motors' autonomous vehicle could be deployed within the next six quarters.
"GM management believes that their AV's, which are being tested in some of the most complex urban environments (the City of San Francisco), will be ready for commercial deployment much sooner than is widely expected," Lache wrote.
General Motors shares rose 2.9 percent shortly after Monday's market open.

Apple investors are now suffering from an unusual condition: loss of money.
After surging as much as 42 percent from the end of 2016 to the beginning of September, Apple has seen a bracing series of losses. The stock slid 5 percent last week alone, for its worst weekly performance in more than a year.
Recent concerns have revolved around Apple's new iPhone 8 and iPhone X products, which were unveiled on Sept. 12. Mild reviews for the iPhone 8 and talk of short lines for the product appear to have taken some wind out of the stock's sails.
Yet Wall Street analysts, always a group somewhat predisposed toward looking on the bright side, say the lack of enthusiasm could actually be a bullish indicator.
"Any Weakness for Early Sales of iPhone 8 Could Be a Case of 'Short-term Pain for Long-Term Gain,'" Piper Jaffray analyst Michael Olson advised in a Friday note. He explained that "potential buyers may wait for iPhone X," and that since the X will tend to be about $250 more expensive than the 8, "a mix shift toward iPhone X, even to the detriment of near-term iPhone 8 units, is positive for Apple."


The market is chugging its way into the last week of September — noted, as we know, for being the worst month of the year historically but now shaping up as just another notch in the bull market's belt.
The Dow has managed to squeak out another 1.7 percent gain that has taken the year-do-date surge to better than 13 percent.
Politics likely will be a big market influence in the days ahead, with a major congressional initiative expected this week.


Check out which companies are making headlines before the bell:
General Motors – Deutsche Bank upgraded the automaker's stock to "buy" from "hold," saying GM is poised to benefit from a much-faster-than-expected commercial deployment of autonomous vehicles. The firm also said the potential valuation of GM's mobility business is "too big to ignore."
Facebook — The social media giant dropped plans to issue a new class of shares that would allow founder Mark Zuckerberg to keep voting control and fund Facebook's philanthropy efforts. Zuckerberg said the value of Facebook's stock has grown sufficiently since the original proposal to accomplish both of those goals and that he has withdrawn the proposal.
Procter & Gamble – Trian Fund Management sent another letter to P&G shareholders, once again urging them to vote for the election of Trian's Nelson Peltz to the company's board.
Genuine Parts – The autoparts company is buying Alliance Automotive Group, Europe's second-largest distributor of vehicle parts, from private-equity funds managed by Blackstone and Alliances' co-founders. The deal is valued at $2 billion, including repayment of Alliance's outstanding debt.
General Electric – GE sold its Industrial Solutions unit to Swiss power grid maker ABB for $2.6 billion.
Walt Disney – Disney threatened to pull its programming from Altice's Optimum service if the two sides can't reach a new deal before the end of the month.
ADP – ADP is in the news again, as the proxy fight between the payroll processing company and hedge fund manager Bill Ackman continues. Ackman is now targeting retail investors in his efforts to get himself and two associates elected to ADP's board.
Unilever – The consumer products company struck a deal to buy Korean skin-care firm Carver Korea for $2.7 billion. Carver Korea is currently owned by Bain Capital and Goldman Sachs, which bought the company a little over a year ago.
Shake Shack, Chipotle, Wingstop – The restaurant chains may be added to Amazon.com's Amazon Restaurants delivery service through its partnership with mobile ordering and pay platform Olo, according to a Bloomberg report.
Ross Stores – The discount retailer was upgraded to "overweight" from "neutral" at JPMorgan Chase, with the price target increased to $74 per share from $65. JPM said it came away from a meeting with management feeling more positive about the off-price retail sector.
Transocean — Transocean was upgraded to "buy" from "neutral" at UBS, which expects the oilfield services company's business to improve in the medium term.
AIG — AIG will remain under federal supervision for now, according to The Wall Street Journal. That follows a meeting of U.S. officials Friday to discuss the insurer's future. AIG will continue to carry the "systemically important" label, which subjects it to extra scrutiny. Separately, AIG announced changes to its organizational structure that eliminates its Commercial and Consumer segments. It will transition to General Insurance and Life & Retirement segments, as well as a standalone technology-enabled platform.
Blue Apron – Guggenheim began coverage on the meal kit maker with a "buy" rating, saying the company participates in a high growth category and is likely to be able to sustain its competitive advantage.
Under Armour – The athletic apparel maker's stock was upgraded to "overweight" from "sector weight" at KeyBanc, saying Under Armour should benefit from the addition of a new chief operating officer as well as a renewed focus on improving its financial performance.
Quest Diagnostics – The medical lab operator's stock was downgraded to "market perform" from "outperform", noting that the new payment rates released by the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services are close to its "worst case scenario".
Colgate-Palmolive – The consumer products maker was upgraded to "overweight" from "equal-weight" at Morgan Stanley, which increased the price target to $84 per share from $75. Morgan Stanley said current valuation provides a "rare opportunity" to buy a well-positioned business compared to less attractive peers.

Index funds have eased much of the decision-making process of investing, except when it comes to selecting your strategy.
When financial advisor Tim Courtney evaluated a prospective client's portfolio last year, he found the entire savings was placed in a myriad of different index funds. A good sign — had they not all tracked the same large U.S. company indexes.
If an economic headwind came blowing through large-cap stocks, the client's entire portfolio would suffer, because each investment would "behave very similarly," said Courtney, who is CIO of Exencial Wealth Advisors.
Courtney's client sought the comfort of index funds but failed to realize that by investing entirely in U.S. large-cap companies, she inherently made a call on the market: that the only safe haven was in large American stocks.
As investors flood index funds with new investments, they're taught that it's the passive strategy that will perform long-term. And it's true; passive index funds outperform most active managers over a 10-year period. But that doesn't mean you're not making investing decisions.
When you first pick your funds, you're making a call on the market or having your internal biases play a role in the index you choose. This leaves you susceptible to common oversights.


Unless you're born with a silver spoon in your mouth, accruing wealth doesn't come easily, which is why CNBC's Jim Cramer is so passionate about helping investors find a viable financial strategy.
"Thanks to the magic of compounding, the earlier in your life you start investing in the market, the bigger your long-term gains can be," the "Mad Money" host said.
Cramer is confident that even if an investor does not have a high-paying job, as long as he saves a decent chunk of his paycheck and invests it wisely each year, he can grow his wealth and become financially independent, at the very least.
In fact, when the "Mad Money" host researched the S&P 500 going all the way back to 1928, the average annual return through the end of 2014 was about 10 percent, including dividends.
"Show me an asset class with a better average return. You can't do it! Stocks aren't just the best game in town, they are really the only game in town if your goal is to grow your wealth," Cramer said.
The 10 percent average return on the S&P 500 may not seem impressive at first, despite the fact that it is more than double what one can expect from a 30-year Treasury bond and much more than what a certificate of deposit from a bank pays.
However, if you understand the magic of compounding, the gain is impressive. For instance, if $100 is invested in the S&P 500 and it gains 10 percent in a year, that will generate $110, after another year it's $121 and after a third year it's $133.
The gains will continue to grow, because each year, money is made from the previous year's profits. With that 10 percent average annual return, an investor can double his money in about seven years, Cramer said.
"The magic of compounding works best the younger you are because that means you have more time for your money to grow," Cramer said.
For instance, if a 22-year-old is just entering the workforce, she has more than 40 years before she retires. She can invest $10,000 in an S&P index fund right now with the anticipation that the next 40 years will not be too different from the last 40 years.
In that case, if the average return remains at 10 percent, in 40 years that $10,000 investment will be worth more than $450,000. Making that money did not require any stock picking, trading or even research on individual companies.
"All you have to do after you initially save that money is let it sit on the sidelines, ideally in a 401(k) plan or an IRA so that you don't' have to pay capital gains or dividend taxes on your gains," Cramer said, with reference to Individual Retirement Accounts.
The same logic can be applied to those in different age groups, but the "Mad Money" host insists that it is best to start early to get the biggest bang for your buck.


A global investor group on Friday called for an independent investigation into a cyber breach at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and urged the regulator to delay new data-gathering rules until it could assure investors that its computer systems were secure.
Wall Street's top regulator came under fire on Thursday after admitting hackers had breached its database of corporate announcements in 2016 and might have used it for insider trading.
The Investment Company Institute (ICI), which represents over 95 million U.S. shareholders, wants the SEC to clear up concerns about its cyber defenses before requiring funds to submit monthly performance data to the regulator, Paul Schott Stevens, the group's chief executive, told Reuters in a phone interview.
"What the SEC breach now makes very clear is precisely what we were concerned about - that market-sensitive information of that nature can be exploited to the disadvantage of millions and millions of investors," Stevens said.
ICI, whose members hold $20 trillion plus in assets, has raised concerns about how the SEC safeguarded industry data it gathers since 2015.
"I'm certain there will be a full inquiry by the Government of Accountability Office — and there should be, so we understand exactly what happened here," Stevens said.
In a July report, the Government Accountability Office (GAO), a congressional watchdog, criticized the SEC for failing to fully protect its computer networks from cyber attacks and recommended a slew of improvements. Some of recommendations it had made in previous reports had still not been implemented, it noted.
Former SEC Chair Mary Jo White, in office when the hack occurred, told Reuters in 2016 that cyber security posed the biggest risk to the U.S. financial system.
Her successor, Jay Clayton, uncovered the full extent of the hack after launching a review of the SEC's cyber security standards earlier this year.
"Some recommendations the GAO made haven't yet been implemented. There's obviously a failure here of some kind. That's why we're so glad Chairman Clayton has moved to address this," said Stevens.
The SEC declined to comment.
New reporting rules which start to come into force in December would require funds for the first time to confidentially file complete monthly portfolio holdings with the SEC, data which the ICI has said could easily be used for insider trading if obtained by hackers.
"Until that information security environment has been established, funds should continue to collect data quarterly, not monthly information, as quarterly data is not nearly as sensitive," said Stevens.
The SEC disclosure came two weeks after credit-reporting company Equifax said a breach had exposed sensitive personal of data up to 143 million U.S. customers. This followed last years cyber attack on SWIFT, the global bank messaging system.
Stevens said rules governing the disclosure of such breaches should be tighter for both public and private organizations.
"That disclosure obligation fixes the mind on need to fix the breach in the first instance."


Jim Cramer has not recommended bonds ever since the 2008 financial crisis because interest rates have been so low.
But that does not mean that there is not a place for bonds in a portfolio. In fact, he says they play an essential role in investing, especially as investors get older.
"In general, for the last few years, even when the stock market has been getting absolutely pounded, bonds simply haven't represented very good values versus equities," the "Mad Money" host said.
Cramer has always had the notion that excessive prudence can be one of the most reckless strategies of all. If too much money is invested in safe, risk-free U.S. Treasury bonds, that basically insures a very low return on an investment. So, for those who want to grow their capital, stocks are the only game in town.
Stocks are a tool to make money, Cramer said, and bonds are for capital preservation — for protecting money and providing a small, steady return that can offset the impact of inflation.
"Depending on how old you are, there is a huge difference in how you should approach the very idea of putting your money in bonds," Cramer said.
Cramer believes many financial experts tell their clients to own bonds a lot earlier in their lifetime than when is really necessary. An investor will likely not get rich from only owning Treasury bonds.
So for investors under 35 who own a bunch of bonds with the idea that they will slowly make money, Cramer thinks they are being too cautious.
Even in a 401(k) or an Individual Retirement Account, Cramer recommends that younger investors weigh their investments very heavily toward stocks, particularly because these types of accounts will allow investors to avoid capital gains or dividend taxes. That means gains can compound, tax-free, year after year.
However, as investors grow older, owning Treasury bonds becomes absolutely essential because bonds are simply safer. So, once investors have used the stock market to make themselves financially independent, they should put more money into U.S. Treasuries for protection.
How much of a retirement portfolio should be kept in bonds versus stocks? Cramer broke it down by age:
"You're going to be living off your investments for the rest of your life, so some part of your portfolio should always be trying to create more wealth in case you live longer than you expect and need more money to support yourself," Cramer said.
So, for younger investors, Cramer says putting money into bonds is a "fool's game." But as one grows older, that bond exposure should grow. This will ensure that the wealth generated from stocks is protected against the volatility of the stock market.


Digital currency trading is exploding and daily volume could "soon" surpass that of Apple, according to a strategist closely followed by hedge funds.
"Cryptocurrency trading volume is now more than of $3bn/day on average, and will likely soon surpass that of the world's most liquid stock: Apple ($4bn/day),"Jens Nordvig, founder and CEO of Exante Data, said in a note Friday.
Nordvig said global daily trading volume between the two largest digital currencies, bitcoin and ethereum, into traditional currencies has multiplied eight times in the last year.

Bitcoin has surged this year, briefly increasing fivefold before tumbling amid a Chinese crackdown on digital currencies and criticism from JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon this month. Bitcoin traded slightly lower near $3,524 midday Friday, but it is still up about 260 percent for the year, according to CoinDesk.
Many digital currency enthusiasts have noted that bitcoin is a way for new investors to access the growing number of digital currencies. Industry website CoinMarketCap lists more than 350 cryptocurrencies with a market value of more than $1 million each.
The total market value of all digital currencies was $121 billion Friday, according to CoinMarketCap.
Bitcoin price year to date

Ethereum traded mildly lower near $256, but was still more than 2,500 percent higher for the year, according to CoinDesk.
While digital currency trading volume has taken off, average daily trading volume in U.S. stocks fell in August to its lowest in three years, according to market researcher Tabb Group.
That said, Nordvig is still cautious on the often volatile digital currencies.
"We do not believe that one can predict with confidence at this point that any given cryptocurrency will continue to thrive and gain status as an alternative to traditional currencies in the long term," Nordvig said. "But we look forward to using the information from an increasingly active cryptocurrency market in our tracking of global capital flows, when appropriate."



The power of Facebook advertising — let's say they can identify 2 billion people around the world based on 200 points of data, which allows them to offer advertisers the holy grail of targeting. Now companies know exactly who is seeing their ads — only the "right" potential consumers. This is unheard of in the history of the world.
Facebook's shareholders have been rightfully rewarded for the company's marketing prowess. It now sports a market capitalization of $500 billion – the only two companies worth more are Apple and Microsoft. Exxon, J&J, Google, JP Morgan, Berkshire – they're all worth less.
So it is true that Facebook has an amazing marketing product and it is also true that the world now fully appreciates this fact.
But what if not everyone agrees to play along? What if this ability to micro-target every living human being to the degree of 200 individual data points is not okay anymore? For example, what if a foreign government — say, Germany — decides that 200 data points is too much information for Facebook to collect and make available about their citizens to advertisers? What if Germany says, "You know what? This is not okay. From now on, you can only utilize 100 of those 200 data points. We don't want our sovereign citizens targeted to that degree by anyone — dishwashing detergent firms, political parties, special interest groups — it's too much influence."
Now what if this happens, and Facebook acquiesces so as to stay out of court, and then a month later Japan says they'd like the same thing? And then the Netherlands? And then the state of Florida? And then the city of Las Vegas? And so on? What if the world begins to make the decision that no entity — corporate or otherwise — ought to have the sort of broad, unchecked free reign that Facebook (and to a lesser extent, Google) has enjoyed over the last few years?
Does Facebook face them all down, one after another, to preserve their advertising technology advantage? Or do they willfully comply and water down their programs? In either case, could this conceivably be a positive for shareholders of Facebook stock?
I can't imagine how.
Can you?
Now you might be saying, "That's not realistic! No one is going to require Facebook to become less good at what they do!"
You'd be wrong. This is absolutely within the realm of possibility, historically speaking. They did it to Microsoft twenty years ago and it's taken the company approximately this entire span of time since to recover. They did it to AT&T back in the day, the irony being that shareholders made a lot more money once all of the component spin-off subsidiaries were given to them. They did it to John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil, even though it took almost twenty years to make it through the courts. By the time they were done with him, it was almost like a relief.
Governments that feel threatened or genuinely fear for the safety and/or competitive position of their constituents will absolutely take action if they feel the need to. Uber must now negotiate with the city of London in order to keep operating there beyond the end of September. They'll probably get to stay, but not without concessions. Might some of those concessions include a lightening up of the company's competitive advantages over the black car taxi system that's long held sway in that city?
This week Facebook announced that it will make public all of the ads purchased by Russian interests during the 2016 elections. That's a start. But the bigger question should not be about the content of the ads or the purported sponsors. It should be about how it can be possible that ads like these can be so lethally effective. The answer, of course, is that Facebook has a one-of-a-kind delivery method to ensure direct hits. How will that sit with Congress when they begin to get their heads around this concept. I am convinced that, for the most part, they are until now completely clueless.
If a government decides that there is a such thing as too much influence being held by a corporation, technology giant or otherwise, there is a risk to its shareholders. We do not live and work in some sort of utopian paradise where all progress is universally celebrated and allowed, unmolested, to do what it will, to whom it will, with what information it pleases.
And I'm not sure how many fishing trips and RV rides Mark Zuckerberg has the time to go on, around the world, in order to preserve the company's monopoly on our collective attention.

Billionaire venture capitalist Jim Breyer is still bullish on large technology stocks in the U.S. and China for the next decade.
CNBC's Mike Santoli spoke with Breyer in an exclusive interview for CNBC PRO on the sidelines of the Delivering Alpha conference in New York last week. Santoli asked the technology investor about his outlook for the industry.
"Five years ago, at Delivering Alpha, I mentioned that Facebook, Apple, Netflix, Google, and the Chinese internet companies were exceptional five-year investments. I still believe that," he said.
Breyer includes Apple in his FANG acronym basket, which is slightly different from the FANG list of Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Alphabet (formerly known as Google) created and popularized by CNBC's Jim Cramer.
The investor is also optimistic on the large Chinese internet companies he calls the "BAT" stocks, which includes Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent. He explained why his FANG and BAT stocks will continue to thrive.
"The FANG plus BAT companies over a five- to 10-year period, from here, I think as a basket, will continue to perform extremely well. They are founder-driven, they are hiring some of the best AI talent in the world, both in the U.S. companies and China," the investor said.
Breyer is the founder and CEO of Breyer Capital, a global venture capital firm based in Menlo Park, California. He has been an investor in more than 40 consumer internet/technology companies that have completed successful public offerings or mergers, including Facebook, Etsy and Marvel Entertainment.

Closely followed trader Art Cashin told CNBC on Friday that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un will be in "big trouble" without China's financial backing.
On Thursday, Reuters reported that China's central bank has told banks to stop doing business with North Korea amid U.S. concerns that Beijing has not been tough enough about Pyongyang's repeated nuclear tests.
"If (China) follows through on what they did that could be a game changer," said Cashin, UBS director of floor operations at the New York Stock Exchange.
"There have been about four or five Chinese banks that have been carrying North Korea. And, if they stop, then (Kim) is going to be in really big trouble," Cashin added in an interview on "Squawk on the Street." "If Chinese banks stop helping them out, they're going to be in dire straits."
Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross echoed Cashin's read on China's banking directive regarding North Korea.
Beijing "sent a message to North Korea that China is not being as supportive of them as it had been," Ross told CNBC on Friday, adding it's "a very welcome move" in conjunction with new U.S. efforts to halt funding for Pyongyang's missile program.
"A lot of the goods going into North Korea have been in support of the missile program and the nuclear program. If we can cut off their ability to import those things that would be very good," he said.
Before joining the Trump administration, Ross amassed a net worth of about $2.5 billion by investing in distressed assets.


Tiffany's sales problems are not likely to be fixed anytime soon, according to a top Wall Street firm.
Goldman Sachs lowered its rating for Tiffany shares to neutral from buy, predicting difficulties in the company's higher-end luxury goods segment even though new management is working to revive revenue growth.
"We remain constructive that new leadership and product initiatives set the stage for accelerating top-line growth over time," analyst Lindsay Drucker Mann wrote in a note to clients Friday. "However, fresh weakness in Tiffany's highest price point categories leaves us concerned that the turnaround timeline is pushed further out."
Tiffany's comparable sales growth in the Americas and Asia Pacific regions declined 1 percent and 7 percent, respectively, in the second quarter of this year "despite easy multi-year comparisons." The company reported an overall comparable sales decline of 2 percent in the July quarter.
The analyst noted weakness in Tiffany's higher-priced categories, including engagement, wedding, high, fine and solitaire jewelry even though it has improved results in lower-priced designer and fashion categories. "Tiffany has improved its lower price point Designer and Fashion offering, but we are concerned that stabilizing high-end categories will be more challenging."
Drucker Mann lowered her Tiffany price target to $94, which is 5 percent higher than Thursday's closing price. Her previous price target was $106.
Without a solid rebound in revenue, "We see limited room for multiple expansion from here," she wrote.
Tiffany shares are up 16 percent year to date through Thursday versus the S&P 500's 12 percent gain. Its stock fell 3 percent shortly after the opening of trading Friday after the report.
The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment.



Apple's rollout of two major new iPhone models this year will pay dividends for the company, according to one Wall Street firm.
Piper Jaffray reiterated its overweight rating and raised its price target for the smartphone maker, predicting Apple's more expensive iPhone offerings will boost its earnings.
Michael Olson, analyst at Piper, raised his price target for Apple shares to $196, which is 28 percent higher than Thursday's closing level. His old target was $190.
The higher-priced iPhone 8 and iPhone X should raise Apple's average selling price overall, Olson wrote in a note to clients Friday. "We recommend owning Apple on potential for a strong overall iPhone cycle, rising ASPs and a favorable services revenue trajectory."
Despite recent weakness this month, Apple is still one of the market's best-performing large-cap stocks so far this year. Its shares have rallied 32 percent through Thursday versus the S&P 500's 12 percent gain.
"If iPhone 8 is weak, it sounds crazy, but that can actually be a good thing because it means iPhone X could be stronger," Olson said on CNBC's "Power Lunch." "That would just be a positive mix shift for Apple as it shifts toward higher priced models."
The analyst estimates Apple's fiscal 2018 iPhone ASP will be $710 versus the $696 Wall Street consensus. As a result, he raised his estimate for the company's fiscal 2018 earnings per share to $11.11 from $10.68 compared with the $10.89 Street average.
"We believe the changes in iPhone X (vs. previous iPhone models), to both form and function, will be a catalyst to drive many new & existing iPhone users to consider an iPhone later this year," he wrote.
The iPhone X will be available on Nov. 3 at a base model price of $999.


Amazon bought grocery chain Whole Foods, and now it wants to work with more restaurants as it moves further into the food industry.
The internet giant has partnered with Olo, a New York-based food delivery service, to list Olo's clients on the Amazon Restaurants food delivery section of Amazon.com.
GrubHub, a rival Chicago-based restaurant takeout service, saw its shares fall more than 6 percent on the news, before regaining some ground to a drop of nearly 2 percent.
"Amazon's obsession with providing great customer and restaurant experience supports the evolving expectations and behaviors of today's consumer," said Noah Glass, CEO of Olo, about the deal.
Amazon Restaurants has integrated into Rails, Olo's application programming interface, which allows for restaurants to list their menus on third-party marketplaces.
Through the integration, Olo's restaurant partners will be featured on Amazon Restaurants, enabling orders through the delivery provider to go directly through a point-of-sale system.
Some of Olo's clients include Chipotle, Denny's, Shake Shack and Wingstop.
The goal of this partnership is to simplify the process for restaurants once customers' orders come in, while also allowing for companies to limit the amount of orders that they take during peak hours, Olo said in a press release.
"This integration will enable Amazon Restaurants to onboard new restaurants with ease, as well as quickly add more new choices and delivery options for customers," added Gus Lopez, general manager of Amazon Restaurants.
"We are excited to leverage Olo's digital ordering technology and continue rapidly growing our network of restaurants to give Amazon Prime members more options for fast delivery from their favorite brands," Lopez said.
GrubHub shares have been on a tear this year, up more than 35 percent in 2017. Last month, Yelp announced it was selling Eat24, its online food-ordering business, to GrubHub. The brands Seamless and MenuPages are also owned by GrubHub.
The race is on to get food delivered from popular restaurants to customers, and more quickly than ever before.


Finish Line shares rebounded Friday after tumbling more than 11 percent at one point in early trading.
The athletic footwear market became "much more promotional" in July and August, which pressured the retailer's second-quarter sales and gross margins, CEO Sam Sato told analysts and investors Friday. He said he expects Finish Line's sales and margin trends to remain difficult for the rest of the year, but said he's confident in the retailer's long-term strategies. Finish Lines shares were up more than 4 percent midafternoon Friday.
More than 70 percent of customer traffic has shifted to mobile, so Finish Line will focus on improving its digital capabilities, Sato said. Initiatives include making webpages load faster and allowing customers to return products directly from Finish Line's website.
Finish Line already offers an app, but Sato said it will be updated to include in-store beacon and geofencing technology, which will connect customers' digital and physical shopping experiences.
On the brick-and-mortar front, Finish Line has already started renovating stores to integrate technology. The company remodeled 10 stores during the quarter, Sato said. Going into the holiday season, that total will be around 90, said Chief Financial Officer Ed Wilhelm.
"While the retail environment remains challenging, particularly for athletic footwear, I am confident that the work we are doing to tightly control expenses and manage inventories, along with the initiative to drive traffic and conversion, will allow us to achieve our full-year guidance while also positioning the company for improved long-term results," Sato said.
Finish Line reported a comparable sales decline — concerning to analysts and investors — of 4.5 percent during the second quarter. The retailer said it continues to expect same-store sales to fall between 3 to 5 percent for both the third and fourth quarters of 2017.
Quarterly net income came in at $2.8 million, or 7 cents per share, down from $22.1 million, or 53 cents a share, one year ago.
Revenue was $469.4 million, a drop of 3.3 percent from last year.
As of Thursday's market close, Finish Line shares have fallen more than 60 percent over the past 12 months.
Earlier this year, the retailer's stock plummeted after it trimmed its outlook for the full year amid disappointing sales volume.
Around that same time, the CEO of rival Dick's Sporting Goods said that his sector of retail was in "panic mode." The remarks immediately sent shock waves across the broader sporting goods space.
Shares of other sporting goods stocks, including Under Armour, Nike, Foot Locker, Hibbett Sports and Big 5 Sporting Goods, have all taken hits over the past few weeks, as negative sentiment around the industry grows.
The threat of Amazon, which continues to make competitive price cuts and ink deals with certain athletic and apparel brands, remains on every company's mind.

In over 30 years of investing, Jim Cramer has seen even the best investors shed tears after a market-wide decline.
To conquer a sell-off, Cramer said investors must first circle the wagons around the stocks in their portfolio that they really like, and leave the weak ones in the dust.
That means knowing the difference between a damaged stock and a damaged company when hunting for bargains during a sell-off.
"A correction is just a mega-sale on stocks, no different than what you might find on all kinds of things at your Sam's Club any day of the week," the "Mad Money" host said.
After those steps are covered, the time comes to get into the nitty-gritty of the specific types of stocks that Cramer scoops up during a downturn. The good news is that the more brutal the sell-off, the more attractive these stocks will look.
His first approach is to look for stocks that have pulled back from their highs during the sell-off. The new-high list is always a great place to start looking. Stocks on that list also tend to be expensive, which is why a big decline may present an opportunity.
Specifically, Cramer looks for stocks that were knocked off the new-high list and are trading a couple of percentage points down from their 52-week high. Those will be the money magnets of the market.
However, the "Mad Money" host warned that not all of them will be worth buying. Some may come off the list because they are damaged goods, so doing your homework is still important.
The second kind of stock that Cramer looks for during a major sell-off is the type with dividends that become more attractive as their share prices go lower. Just like the 52-week high list is useful for spotting potential buys, a shopping list of stocks to buy if only their dividends were a little higher can also come in handy during a downturn.
But what does a market correction have to do with a dividend or yield?
When a market correction occurs, the price of the stock goes down and the yield goes up. Cramer loves it when a sell-off is so severe that an "accidental high-yielder" is created.
That refers to stocks that did not intend on being dividend plays, but fell so hard that the dividend yield suddenly became meaningful or a way for the stock to have a quick bounce back.
"I know dividend investing isn't sexy, but believe me when I tell you that nobody ever woke up unhappy the next morning after bringing home a stock with a big dividend," Cramer said.
So, for more conservative investors, Cramer recommends picking up stocks that will practically guarantee money accumulation. That is exactly what a dividend does.
In short, Cramer considers a sell-off as an opportunity to buy some of the best stocks out there, especially those that have just pulled off their highs, or those that garner fat yields thanks to the decline.


Check out which companies are making headlines before the bell:
T-Mobile — T-Mobile is close to agreeing to tentative terms on a deal to merge with its telecom peer, Sprint, Reuters reported on Friday. Japan's SoftBank, which controls Sprint, would reportedly own between 40 to 50 percent of the combined company. A deal is expected by the end of October, according to the sources who spoke to Reuters.
Apple — Apple's latest version of the iPhone, the iPhone 8, starts shipping on Friday. While some product reviewers have said they love the device, others are telling shoppers to hold off for the iPhone X. Apple's iPhone 8, the cheapest phone announced at the company's event on Sept. 12, has a sticker price of $699, about $50 over the last generation of iPhones.
Facebook — Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said on Thursday that the social media company will share information with Congress about suspected Russian-linked election ads. Earlier this month, Facebook released results of an investigation into the 2016 U.S. election. The investigation found about $100,000 in ad spending from June 2015 to May 2017, associated with roughly 3,000 ads believed to be from Russian profiles. Zuckerberg has said he instructed his staff to provide those ads to Congress.
Conagra — Orville Redenbacher's popcorn owner Conagra Brands is nearing a deal to buy Angie's Artisan treats, the maker of Angie's Boomchickapop popcorn. The potential deal comes as sales of big food companies have slowed, with their staples being replaced by fresher, healthier brands.
Hewlett Packard — Hewlett Packard Enterprise is planning to cut at least 5,000 workers, or about 10 percent of its staff, by the end of this year, according to reports. Most recently and under CEO Meg Whitman, the company has been streamlined, shedding much of its Chinese business and consulting division.
Tesla — Tesla will discontinue its cheapest Model S, the rear-wheel-drive 75, on Sunday. The carmaker first announced in July that it would discontinue the rear-wheel model. Tesla is shifting to an all-wheel-drive lineup for the Model S, to simplify its product offering.
Boeing — The trade dispute between Boeing and its Canadian rival, Bombardier, is heating up, with Boeing standing its ground. The two are battling over a potential defense sale worth about $5 billion. More details are slated to be revealed next week, when the U.S. Commerce Department issues its initial ruling on Sept. 26.
Wal-Mart — The big-box retailer has partnered with smart-lock maker August to test the in-home delivery of packages and groceries, directly to customers' refrigerators. Wal-Mart is currently running a pilot of the service in Silicon Valley with a small group of August Home customers. The move comes as retail rivals Amazon and Target are both beefing up their own delivery options for grocery items.
Finish Line — Shares of the athletic shoe and apparel retailer fell in premarket hours Friday, after Finish Line said comparable sales tumbled 4.5 percent during the second quarter. Finish Line's net income fell to $2.8 million, or 7 cents per share, from $22.1 million, or 53 cents a share, a year ago.


JPMorgan Chase Chief Executive Jamie Dimon has laid into bitcoin and digital currencies once again, warning that governments will shut them down if they grow too large.
"Right now these crypto things are kind of a novelty. People think they're kind of neat. But the bigger they get, the more governments are going to close them down," Dimon said during an interview with CNBC-TV18 in New Delhi on Friday.
Dimon was concerned that with bitcoin, ethereum and various initial coin offerings (ICOs), there are now cryptocurrencies everywhere.
"It's creating something out of nothing that to me is worth nothing," he said. "It will end badly."
Dimon warned that governments will eventually crack down on cryptocurrencies and will attempt to control it by threatening anyone who buys or sells bitcoin with imprisonment, which would force digital currencies into becoming a black market.
These are the latest comments from Dimon attacking bitcoin. Earlier this month he called the cryptocurrency a "fraud.". His comments, along with several prominent hedge fund investors, came before a sharp sell-off in bitcoin. The price for one bitcoin fell from around $4,340 to as low as $2,981.05 in the days after his comments.
Bitcoin has since recovered to around $3,640.68, according to CoinDesk data. Despite this volatility, bitcoin's value has risen 264 percent this year.
Dimon's comments came under criticism from several bitcoin investors and experts.
"Comments like Jamie's show a failure to grasp the significance of the blockchain and the power of brand in a fundamental sea of change," said Scott Nelson, chairman and CEO of blockchain firm Sweetbridge, in an email to CNBC last week.
Meanwhile, a company called Blockswater has filed a market abuse complaint in Sweden against Dimon and JPMorgan. Blockswater claims Dimon deliberately spread false and misleading information, according to a report by City A.M. JPMorgan Chase declined to comment, the report said.


Jim Cramer's motto in a downturn is to buy broken stocks, not broken companies.
When the market undertakes huge losses, investors have an opportunity to buy good companies with stocks that have taken an unfair beating because of the market, the "Mad Money" host said.
There's a huge difference between a broken company and a broken stock, and being able to thrive in a sell-off requires knowing the difference.
That's why Cramer said the first thing to do amid a market-wide sell-off is look at the companies that caused it.
"If you're looking at a company that is part of the reason for a correction, you're looking at a broken company. Those are directly in the blast zone and certain to be obliterated," Cramer said.
For instance, in 2007, there were multiple sell-offs related to a weak real estate market, and tons of bad subprime and regular loans. Any entity that touched housing, mortgages or any kind of lending would have been considered a broken company.
Cramer also reminded investors that a company does not break just because its stock goes lower. Investors saw this in 2012 when domestic companies were brought down just because of turmoil in Europe.
How could a fast-casual Mexican chain like Chipotle take a hit because of Italian bonds? "Well, it happened," the "Mad Money" host said.
Stocks like Chipotle went down because all stocks were going down at the time, not because it had a connection to the sell-off.
"To put it another way, you don't want to buy the stocks that are leading the decline when you're looking for opportunity in a sell-off. You want to look for stocks in areas that are independent of what's ailing the market," Cramer said.
Once a company breaks, it is very difficult to put it back together again. The same goes for sectors, which control half of their stocks' movements.
In a sell-off, some stocks will have a clear reason for going lower, and others will just be sold off with everything else. The first stocks to be sold will be the broken companies — which Cramer says to avoid at all costs — and the second group will be the broken stocks. Those are the stocks to gobble up quickly if you want to take advantage of a correction, Cramer said.


The SEC disclosed on Wednesday that EDGAR, its corporate filing system, was hacked in 2016 and information was potentially used for illegal stock trades.
EDGAR is where Corporate America goes to file statements on their businesses. Brad Bondi, an attorney with Cahill Gordon and Reindel and former council at the SEC, called it "the Fort Knox" of the SEC. It's where the important stuff is stored: quarterly earnings reports, market-moving news, IPOs, mergers and acquisitions, it all goes into the EDGAR system, and is often filed before the news is made public.
I'll oversimplify this a bit with an example: suppose a company was going to announce that their fourth quarter earnings were going to be well below expectations due to some outside event. They have to notify the SEC of this, and they would do it through a filing in the EDGAR system.
Under some circumstances, they may file the report before it is actually released to the public.


The Federal Reserve announced on Wednesday that it would start to unwind its massive $4.6 trillion balance sheet, as it embarks on its long awaited plan to normalize monetary policy.
As the central bank of the United States, the Fed does not have to follow the normal rules generally applied to financial institutions and it is exempt from the requirements that virtually all other global central banks must adhere to. But what if it were required to act as a private financial institution and it was not immune to all normal rules of finance? How would it be evaluated?
My view is that it would be regarded as an insolvent savings and loan institution with a terribly mismatched balance sheet that was headed for meaningful trouble. The fact that this is ignored when reviewing the agency's policy initiatives is surprising and a serious mistake.
S&L characteristics
The savings and loan companies of old captured deposits from individuals and institutions. By law they could only invest this money in government backed securities and mortgages. By and large that is how the Fed's balance sheet is constructed. The latest numbers show that the FRB balance sheet has $4.5 trillion in assets. These assets are composed of $2.5 trillion in Treasury securities, $1.8 trillion in mortgage backed securities, and $0.2 trillion in other holdings like gold for example. This balance sheet in its broad form is very, very similar to an S&L.
Insolvent
One of the problems that the S&L's had was that they could not sell the mortgages that they held. Thus, they were insolvent. Well guess what? The Fed cannot sell it mortgage backed securities either.


The finance professor who correctly called the Dow Jones industrial average's surge to 20,000 said he expects stocks to jump even higher in the last 101 days of the year.
The Wharton School's Jeremy Siegel believes it'll have a lot to do with President Donald Trump's intention to get business-friendly reforms passed on Capitol Hill — not the latest Federal Reserve decision on interest rates or better-than-expected economic growth figures.
"I would say corporate tax reform could add another 10 percent to the market even this year," Siegel said Wednesday on CNBC's "Trading Nation." A deal "looks very likely to get done."
It's the second time in less than 12 months that Siegel, a longtime bull, has made a bold market call. And it came on a day when the Dow and S&P 500 closed at record highs.
In the final weeks of 2016, Siegel argued that the blue chip stock index was very close to hitting the 20,000 milestone. It broke through that key psychological level on Jan. 25 and since then has soared more than 10 percent.
If Siegel is right this time, too, a 10 percent jump would put the Dow around 24,650 and the S&P 500 at 2,760 based on Wednesday's closes.
"There's new hope that taxes really have a chance to be done. I remained steadfast throughout some of the bleak days in the last few months when no one thought anything could be done," Siegel added.
"There's a little bit more optimism now. I think a corporate tax deal will be done, and I think that will be positive for the equity market," he said.


Closely followed trader Art Cashin warned on Thursday that the current Federal Reserve leadership will likely not be around next year and he doesn't think the central bank will implement three interest rate hikes in 2018.
On Wednesday, the Fed announced it will begin to roll off its $4.5 trillion balance sheet next month, but decided to hold interest rates steady.
The so-called dot plot, which provides the forecast of each policy panel member for the federal funds rate, projects one more rate hike this year and a total of three next year. The CME FedWatch tool on Thursday morning put the chances of a rate increase in December at about 70 percent.
"They're getting close to perfect. The Fed traditionally doesn't hike unless there is a 70 percent probability and we're getting awfully close to that," said Cashin, UBS director of floor operations at the New York Stock Exchange.
"For a year I've said I still have suspicions about December and I don't see any way they're doing three hikes next year. We've got to remember that we're going to have a bit of a different Fed when it comes to implementing this," he added in an interview on CNBC's "Squawk on the Street."
President Donald Trump has a chance to reshape the Fed. Janet Yellen's term as Fed chair ends in February. And, earlier this month Fed Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer said he would step down in mid-October for personal reasons, adding another vacancy.
Some speculated that Trump's top economic advisor, Gary Cohn, would assume the role as Fed chair. Cohn's chance reportedly fell after he criticized the president for his comments on a violent white nationalist rally Charlottesville, Virginia, last month.
"It's nice to know what the current Fed is thinking but they may not be around to make those decisions," Cashin said.
"There's an awful lot of variables out there," he added.
Regarding the market, Cashin said there is still hope that some of Trump's business-friendly proposals will make it through. "That we may see a tax cut, we may see some other things that may move the economy along," Cashin said.
"Stocks are going to keep living on whether they can get something done in Washington," he said.
Cashin said the recent slew of hurricanes may not be fully priced into the market, citing misfortunes such as Puerto Rico being completely without power after Hurricane Maria hit.
Lastly, he says to keep an eye on the U.S. dollar. "The dollar starts to strengthen appreciably. Will that affect the multinationals? What's going to happen to earnings?" Cashin said.


Warren Buffett is famously optimistic, but his view of the U.S. stock market long term is more conservative than it might suggest.
At a party for Forbes magazine's centennial earlier this week, Buffett said the Dow Jones industrial average will be over 1 million in 100 years, up from 22,397 currently (which is near a record, by the way).
The 87-year-old acknowledged there's a strong likelihood he won't be around to take a victory lap on his prediction, but he also said it isn't unreasonable.
"Whenever I hear people talk pessimistically about this country, I think they're out of their mind," Buffett, the chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, said Tuesday, as reported by Reuters.
He pointed out the Dow was at 81 a century ago. It was first created in the late 1890s to represent a basket of 30 big American companies.
But Buffett's value-investing fellow billionaire, Mario Gabelli, joked on Twitter about whether Buffett's normally sunny outlook had darkened given the numbers. "one million in one hundred years ...has Buffett turned bearish?" Gabelli said in a tweet Thursday.

Contacted for further comment, Gabelli left a voicemail for CNBC saying he was "just having some fun" with numbers, but added the roughly 3.9 percent compound annual growth rate needed to get from where the Dow is today to where Buffett predicts it will be in 2117 would be lower than the 5.5 percent CAGR from the beginning of the 20th century until now.
"Warren is always looking out long term," Gabelli said. "I'm assuming Warren was just having some fun."
Buffett spoke and performed on Tuesday at the Forbes party, noting that about 1,500 people had made the magazine's list of richest Americans (including himself).
"Being short America has been a loser's game. I predict to you it will continue to be a loser's game," he said. None of them, he said, had bet against U.S. growth. "It has been 241 years since Thomas Jefferson wrote the Declaration of Independence," Buffett said. "Being short America has been a loser's game. I predict to you it will continue to be a loser's game."


The Wells Fargo Investment Institute doesn't expect the S&P 500 to rise more than 2 percent over the next 15 months, according to the firm's 2018 year-end outlook released Thursday.
While some Wall Street strategists have included 2018 S&P targets in their equities notes, the Wells Fargo note marks the first major outlook report for next year.
Wells Fargo gave a range of 2,450 to 2,550 for the S&P next year, a decline of 2.3 percent or a rise of nearly 1.7 percent from Wednesday's record close of 2,508.24. The S&P 500 also hit an intraday high Wednesday of 2,508.85.
"The synchronized global recovery that took hold in 2017 should gain in 2018, though restrained by ongoing global headwinds from high debt, slow labor recoveries overseas and political uncertainties around the world," Wells Fargo's global investment strategy team wrote in a Monday note that was distributed to the media Thursday.
"We also anticipate that earnings gains will fuel moderately higher U.S. and international equity markets," the report said. The strategists added that since the U.S. economy is likely in the "final third" of expansion, investors must be particularly aware of risks.
In late August, the Wells Fargo Investment Institute raised its 2017 year-end target range by 70 points to 2,300 to 2,400. At the time, the increase still forecast, at best, a roughly 1 percent decline for the S&P.
Among 15 strategists surveyed by CNBC last year, Wells Fargo Investment Institute's Scott Wren came the closest to predicting where the S&P would end the year, albeit at a range. The middle of his target range was 2,240, and the S&P ended 2016 at 2,238.83.
— CNBC's Tom Franck contributed to this report.
Correction: This story has been updated to reflect the S&P 500 hit an intraday high Wednesday.


Famed short seller Jim Chanos is not a fan of the restaurant sector. As a result, he is shorting burger chain stocks.
CNBC's Mike Santoli spoke with Chanos in an exclusive interview for CNBC PRO 
 on the sidelines of the Delivering Alpha conference in New York last week. Santoli asked the hedge fund manager which areas of the market are attractive to bet against.
The "problem in the burger space, where we happen to have a number of shorts, is that the 800-pound Big Mac got better. McDonald's righted the ship and has now reinvested aggressively in its restaurants, in its franchisees and upping the game for everybody else," he said. The burger market "is a shrinking pie. When the big guy begins to take more of the shrinking pie that leaves a lot less for everybody else."
Shorting is a trading strategy that involves selling borrowed shares with a view that the stock will drop in value. The shares can be then be bought back later at a lower price and returned for a profit.
The investor did not specify which companies he is short. He did say his firm is not short McDonald's nor Shake Shack, but "everybody else pretty much is fair game" to bet against in the burger industry.

Chanos also explained why the restaurant industry's franchise business model is facing difficulties:
"Because you can only increase as a franchiser, your revenues by increasing units, increasing same-store sales for which you get royalties, or increasing your royalty rate. The restaurants are struggling so you can't increase the royalty rate. The reason why they are struggling is that same-store sales are declining, which means therefore to meet Wall Street's sometimes lofty goals you have to increase unit openings …. which exacerbates the [negative] trends."
Chanos is founder and managing partner of Kynikos Associates, one of the largest short selling investment firms in the world. He is lauded for his prescient negative calls on Enron and Tyco.

On the healthcare and medical services industry: "We believe pretty strongly that a sea change is happening in the U.S. health-care system. That we are embarked upon the ending of health-care inflation," he said.
"The days of just raising prices aggressively is coming to an end ... We found a number of companies that are aggressively gaming the reimbursement system to the detriment of us tax payers.  I think those business models are going to be in a lot of trouble," the hedge fund manager added.
Chanos is founder and managing partner of Kynikos Associates, one of the largest short selling investment firms in the world. He is lauded for his prescient negative calls on Enron and Tyco.

The stock of FedEx went on a wild ride after the shipping giant's Tuesday earnings report, but CNBC's Jim Cramer knew what was behind the move.
Even though the quarter was widely seen as weak and shares initially fell, the stock turned around and closed up 2 percent on Wednesday.
"It was a terrific moment to buy, and it was no wonder that the stock of FedEx finished up more than $4 bucks today. You see, there was actually no disappointment. If anything there was tremendous exuberance," the "Mad Money" host said.
Investors were initially worried about FedEx's European division being hacked, a $300 million problem that the company worked swiftly to fix. But Cramer said other, more powerful drivers overshadowed the cyberbreach.
"FedEx benefits from a robust global economy, where e-commerce from brick-and-mortar retailers is growing like a weed. One of the execs on the conference call, a fellow by the name of Rajesh Subramaniam, told us, and I quote, 'We are seeing the best year for global trade in years,'" Cramer said.
FedEx's management attributed the rapid growth to the expansion of manufacturing, particularly in the technology space. With plenty of forward-thinking initiatives underway, the company may quickly regain its place in Wall Street's good graces, Cramer said.
"In the end, regardless of the hack, this company is doing incredibly well and it's the logical play on worldwide growth," the "Mad Money" host concluded. "Yep, even after FedEx's run today and that amazing reversal, I think it's got a lot more upside."


As the stock of semiconductor manufacturer Nvidia tumbled in after-hours trading on news of a Tesla-AMD partnership focused on self-driving cars, CNBC's Jim Cramer had to figure out what to do next.
Shares of Nvidia hit an all-time high on Monday following several analyst upgrades that cited the company's promising position in the fields of artificial intelligence, gaming and data centers.
But with the stock now falling from its highs, Cramer wouldn't blame investors for feeling uneasy about what's next for Nvidia.
"Perhaps after its rally and this AMD news, the stock actually deserves to get punished. Perhaps this is just one more buying opportunity, though," the "Mad Money" host said. "You have to know what you're doing and what could happen to the stock."
So Cramer enlisted the help of technician Carolyn Boroden, the creator of FibonnacciQueen.com and one of Cramer's colleagues at RealMoney.com.
Boroden has a notable track record on predicting chipmakers' stock moves. In August, she said Nvidia's rally was far from over, predicting upside targets of $180 and $188 with a ceiling at $209.
So far, Nvidia's stock has followed Boroden's predicted path, which is based on Fibonacci ratios. She uses the medieval mathematical system to find the levels at which a given stock is likely to change its path based on past swings. She also uses it to find the dates when trajectory changes are the most likely to help investors find the best times to buy or sell.
With Boroden's methodology in mind, Cramer turned to the daily chart of Nvidia.

Boroden noticed that the stock has already made a 127.2 percent extension of its last swing. An extension, or how much lower a stock's current decline is than its previous one, tends to mark the end of a stock's rally, which means Nvidia could be due for a bigger pullback, Cramer said.
Moreover, Nvidia's longest rallies have lasted between 25 and 29 trading days, and Monday marked the most recent rally's 25th day. Cramer said the pullback may have already started given the negative action in Nvidia, which means its rally could be tapering out.
Boroden also found that Nvidia tends to lose momentum after running up anywhere from 35 to 42 points. The last time this happened, the stock got hit before restarting its climb.
Cramer doesn't necessarily think that pattern will repeat itself, but he thought it was worth noting that Nvidia's shares gained $38.29 from their low on August 11 to their high on Monday, putting it right in the range that indicates the rally may have run its course.
So while Cramer's charitable trust, which owns shares of Nvidia, isn't taking any action, Boroden would bless some profit-taking if the stock holds up its historical patterns and starts to decline.
And for investors who don't own Nvidia, they could be about to get a great buying opportunity in the next week or so, Cramer said.
"Here's the bottom line: I like Nvidia, but I love protecting your profits even more," Cramer said. "The charts, as interpreted by Carolyn Boroden, suggest that Nvidia could be due for a $10 to $30 pullback after its recent run, and if you're nimble, maybe you want to try to sidestep some of that decline. More important, if Nvidia is pulverized like that, well, maybe you get a chance to own a piece of this great semiconductor company with a remarkable number of strengths and very few weaknesses, even as this potential loss of the Tesla business to AMD could certainly be one of them."


With the cybersecurity breach at Equifax top of mind on Wall Street, Mimecast chief Peter Bauer said employees are just as critical as technological security when it comes to protecting digital information.
"Particularly with email security, attackers have figured out that the human sitting behind the computer is one of the weakest links," Bauer told "Mad Money" host Jim Cramer in an exclusive interview on Wednesday. "And what an attacker is really interested in is can they get a hold of credentials, could they deploy malware on that person's machine, or could they get their help or cooperation in some way in launching an attack?"
Bauer is the co-founder, chairman, and CEO of Mimecast, a cloud-based company specializing in email cybersecurity and management.
Besides putting an emphasis on employee education, his company develops technology to track imperfections in emails that could indicate a potential hack.
"There's a large number of adversaries really interested in profiteering or sabotaging organizations digitally," Bauer said. "We see a lot of what one would call 'typo squatting,' where domains have been registered that look quite similar to a domain that you would expect, but it's actually not coming from the organization that you think it is."
Bauer said Mimecast talks to management teams daily to make them aware of the scope of cyberattacks worldwide. The company recently secured a number of clients and partnerships after McAfee spun off from Intel in April of this year.
But with the Equifax hack threatening the information of 143 million customers, Bauer said more companies are beginning to wake up to the significance of securing their systems.
"It really does raise the issue of how seriously are boards taking cybersecurity?" the CEO said.
And as cyberattacks surge worldwide, new regulations like the European Union's General Data Protection Rule are helping spread awareness to managements and boards, Bauer said.
"It's a never-ending story, because as we innovate and develop more and more digital technologies that the world becomes reliant on, so vulnerabilities happen right behind them as technology changes," the CEO said. "With new regulations like GDPR, for example, coming through in Europe, the size of the penalties to organizations is really significant. And so I think this is really raising the visibility for boards around cybersecurity."


In a stock market consumed by news from the Federal Reserve, CNBC's Jim Cramer was focused on three other events that were domino-like in how they toppled stocks.
"What were today's dominoes? Well, we got three of them: Apple, specifically issues with the Apple Watch, but also some concerns that the phone may not be that strong, General Mills in what I regard as a flabbergasting disappointment of an earnings report, and still one more miserable quarter from Bed Bath & Beyond," the "Mad Money" host said on Wednesday.
Apple's decline was caused by a potential glitch in the new Apple Watch. The Verge discovered that the device had some problems connecting to networks, which occasionally prevented users from making calls, sending texts or using Siri. Apple announced it was working on a fix.
Cramer figured that because the Apple Watch is much less important to the company than the iPhone, the connectivity issue would pass, even with a momentary stall in watch sales.
But Apple's decline caused a domino effect in a slew of its suppliers' stocks including Skyworks Solutions, Qorvo, Cirrus Logic, Texas Instruments, and Broadcom.
"My take? If you don't own any of these stocks, then I would start picking small at one of them into weakness," Cramer said. "You may not get an instant rally, especially if we keep hearing rumors about some sort of weakness in an Apple product line, but you're certainly getting a fabulous price break versus where they were a few weeks ago, and these stocks all get cheaper as they go down."
General Mills' earnings report, the second domino, also took down key grocery stocks after the company announced a 7 percent drop in cereal sales and double-digit declines in yogurt sales.
All together, General Mills' earnings declined by 9 percent, a stark difference from the positive picture management painted at a conference less than two weeks ago. Shares of Kellogg, Kraft Heinz, Campbell Soup, Conagra Brands, JM Smucker and Hershey fell in response.
But unlike the technology names, Cramer did not want to defend the consumer packaged foods names, which are all under pressure from the Amazon-Whole Foods entity, Wal-Mart and Kroger.
"They aren't exactly loved by millennials. And in many cases, their raw costs are going up while their sales are flat-lining or going down," Cramer added. "However, the packaged food stocks make excellent dominoes because they're very good at falling."
Finally, Bed Bath & Beyond's earnings report evidently told Cramer and others that the company hasn't been able to compose an Amazon-proof strategy.
The miss took down the stocks of Macy's, Kohl's, Target and Costco, all brick-and-mortar-based companies that investors fear are in the path of Amazon's retail domination.
So as the market frothed over the Fed's announcement that it would unravel its balance sheet but leave interest rates unchanged, Cramer maneuvered the falling dominoes to find the best investing strategy.
"When this market gets some bad news after its remarkable run, you have to break out the dominoes to explain the sector decline," Cramer said. "I wish I could tell you the game is now done for these given sectors and the damage contained. Usually, though, we get more than one day as analysts come out and start downgrading. I say if you own no tech stocks, take a stab at one of your favorites, but take a pass on the foods and the retailers because those dominoes actually deserve to fall."


Even if you're skeptical about cryptocurrencies, the ICO, or initial coin offering, has been one of the hottest trends in tech this year.
Startups that raised money through ICOs have accumulated a record $2.2 billion this year alone, according to Coinschedule.com.
Unlike a stock IPO, where companies sell shares, an ICO lets investors buy digital "coins" used on cryptocurrency platforms. Companies built on blockchain, a digital database for recording financial transactions, raise money by selling these tokens, which can be used to pay for goods and services on their platform or can be stashed away as an investment.
So what's causing the ICO craze this year?
Charles River Ventures' Rafael Corrales, an early investor in Blockchain, a bitcoin wallet maker with $70 million in funding, narrowed it down to three main drivers:
Corrales said the ICO space still has a lot of problems, like the lack of proper regulation. And he pointed out that the fact that startups are raising a lot of money at once, instead of in separate stages, like more traditional startups do, is concerning. Still, he expects the ICO craze to continue until some credible regulatory body like the SEC or IRS comes down hard on a select group of people that they will try to make an example of.
But in aggregate, he says the exuberance in the space is a good thing because it lays the groundwork for the industry to mature. And eventually, he hopes to see the next big tech company come out of this space, much like the 90's dot com bubble led to the creation of Google and Amazon, among others.
"It's just noisy right now because of a Cambrian explosion that's happening. But I do think there will be a handful of important companies and innovations that will come out of it," he said.


Guggenheim Partners chief investment officer Scott Minerd downplayed reports that there was upheaval at the firm, telling CNBC on Monday "there is no tumult."
Reports have included that Mark Walter was considering stepping down as CEO and that there was a power struggle between Walter and Minerd.
Minerd called the characterization of a power struggle "completely wrong" and said there is "no fighting" going on between the two.
He said Guggenheim is one of the fastest-growing asset management firms and because of that a lot of decisions need to be made.
"We are highly energetic internally. There's a very spirited debate on the things to do that are right and wrong. And I think people from the outside or even people on the inside can misunderstand that sometimes," he said in an interview with "Power Lunch."
In fact, Minerd said his relationship with Walter is probably better than it's ever been and that he's "highly supportive" of the CEO.
On Tuesday, the Financial Times reported that Walter's role was "hanging in the balance" amid a power struggle between Walter and Minerd.
Bloomberg News reported earlier Tuesday that Walter may step away from day-to-day management of Guggenheim, and The Wall Street Journal later reported on Tuesday that the billionaire has told colleagues he is considering stepping down as CEO.
A source told Reuters that at least one member of Guggenheim's board of directors has pressed Walter to leave the firm after he became the subject of news coverage. However, on Wednesday the board told employees the CEO has the full support of each and every one of its members, according to the Wall Street Journal.
Guggenheim Partners responded on Tuesday that Walter has no current plans to step down and is not being pushed out of the investment firm he helped found.
When asked if Walter planned to stick around, Minerd replied, "All of us have to make a decision someday about what our lives are and where we're going. Mark has not given any indication that he wants to leave at this time."


Warren Buffett may be famous for his investing skill, but his lounge act isn't bad, either.
He took to the stage as recently as Tuesday night, at the centennial party for Forbes magazine in New York, where he teamed up with Stevie Wonder to sing Billy Hill's 1936 classic "The Glory of Love."
Buffett likes the song, or at least knows all the words to it, because he also sang it and accompanied on the ukulele at another Forbes party a few years ago.  That duet was with Jon Bon Jovi, who played along on the guitar. "Groupies!" Buffett yelled to a laughing audience, "I've been waiting all my life."
Three years ago the Oracle of Omaha teamed up with Paul Anka to serenade Fortune magazine reporter Carol Loomis in a reworded rendition of Frank Sinatra's "My Way." And he played the ukulele and sang along with the Quebe Sisters at his annual meeting in 2008, with a version of "Red River Valley."
Buffett sang for CNN host Piers Morgan in 2013, admitting he never met Sinatra but he likes "My Way." He did forget some of the words that time.
He also accompanied himself on ukulele while singing the Coca-Cola song for a 100th birthday tribute to his favorite soft drink.


The giants of the internet economy are typically cast as the leading fetish objects for growth investors. But compared to the TAMP stocks, FANG looks a bit dull.
What's TAMP,  you ask? That would be Thermo Fisher Scientific, Agilent, Mettler-Toledo and PerkinElmer, just a few of the seldom-discussed names that have powered the obscure S&P 500's life sciences tools & services subsector to a 41 percent year-to-date gain.
By comparison, FANG – Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google parent Alphabet – are up less than 36 percent this year on an equal-weighted basis.
The life sciences tools group — which also includes Illumina, Waters and Quintiles IMS — totals more than $170 billion in market value (about equal to the size of Intel). The companies fall within the health-care sector, but they neither discover cures nor deliver care. They provide lab equipment, testing supplies, analytical devices and services to the pharmaceutical and biotech industries, as well as some chemical and industrial customers.
Part of their appeal to investors in an aging and slow-growing world: They profit from the volume of new-drug investigations and lab tests, favorable demographics and the total amount of health care delivered globally but they don't have direct regulatory risk from drug-price controls or an Obamacare repeal.
It helps, too, that the companies generally are steady long-term performers that have done many bolt-on acquisitions in their chosen product areas and tend to convert mid-single-digit sales growth into low-double-digit per-share earnings expansion.
A strong and sustained rally in a cluster of stocks will always have a tidy fundamental story behind it, and here's the case for the lab-products names, according to analyst Paul Knight at Janney Montgomery Scott:
"Even with a sector showing strong performance in 2017, the fundamental backdrop for life science tools is becoming a 'Goldilocks' situation. Asia is the largest tools market and growth is in double digits, industrial demand is increasing with robust PMI indicators at seven-year highs, and currency tailwinds are developing."
S&P 500/Life Sciences Tools & Services versus S&P 500 (YTD)

More drug investigations and approved treatments, of increasing complexity, are expected. The booming field of immunotherapy development is a growth engine in itself, requiring complex material-handling and storage processes.
It all nets out to a dream growth-investor arrangement: Long-lived demographic forces, resistance to the economic cycle, stable business-to-business supply relationships, global distribution, and a "razors and blades" recurring-sales model.
The fact that these attributes have propelled such gaudy share-price gains, though, makes it worth asking whether professional investors are crowding into these names to hide from policy or macro threats that might, at some point, fade away.
In the current phase of the bull market, "reliable growth companies" that play a middleman role in de facto oligopolies have hogged a lot of the oxygen, at the expense of more cyclical plays, and especially consumer-facing companies whose moats are seen to be drying up.
Retail, media, branded-clothing and packaged-food stocks are suffering, as investors implicitly shun businesses that require consumers to make an active, conscious decision to spend on a product. Internet platforms, payment processors, aerospace, semiconductors and, yes, health-care tools companies have been enriched at their expense.
The result, for the life-sciences supply names, is valuations at the very high end of the stocks' own historical range. The TAMP stocks and their peers are now fetching between 20 and 40 times projected earnings for the coming year, compared to around 18 for the broader market. And, remember, these are companies generally growing not much faster than nominal world GDP, with admittedly attractive profit margins.
Technical analysts tend to love the group, identifying what look like sturdy long-term uptrends, even if some appear a bit stretched in the short term (note that the sector shed 1 percent on Tuesday in a largely flat market).
The risk to investors at these prices for the likes of Mettler-Toledo, PerkinElmer or Illumina is not that the companies stumble or laboratory volumes roll over. The stocks, instead, could be exposed to a change in investor preferences and outlook on the world.
If the bull market sputters, of course, it would not be kind to once-sleepy growth stocks at premium multiples. And if, instead, confidence grows in the economic-growth outlook and central banks do allow interest rates to rise, fewer investors might feel the need to hide in this corner of the health-care sector.
The question is not whether these are good businesses. They are. The riddle is always what assumptions motivated the last buyer of the stock of a fine business, and what price might be too high to pay for one.


It has been a good year for Johnson & Johnson shareholders, but now Goldman Sachs says investors should ring the register.
The firm on Wednesday lowered its rating for the company to sell from neutral, predicting the drugmaker's earnings growth will lag its peers during the next five years.
After the note, the stock was down 1.5 percent in early trading Wednesday.
"While JNJ's pharma division has improved and we expect accelerated growth in the near term, pressure on key franchises coupled with still slow growth of MD&D (Medical Devices & Diagnostics) and persistent pressure in consumer leaves JNJ with a below average long-term growth outlook that suggests valuation is stretched," analyst Jami Rubin wrote in a note to clients.
The company has outperformed the market this year with its shares up 17 percent through Tuesday compared with the S&P 500's 12 percent return.
Rubin predicts Johnson & Johnson will grow its earnings per share 7 percent annually during the next five years versus her 10 percent industry average forecast.
"JNJ lacks optionality for upside relative to the rest of our pharma coverage," she wrote. "The buy rated stocks in our coverage have fairly significant optionality up ahead. For instance, ABBV has a pipeline with potential for multiple best-in-class assets."
Rubin increased her price target for the company to $130 from $125, representing 4 percent downside from Tuesday's close.
"We are fully confident in our strategy to drive growth and to continue to create shareholder value in the near and long-term," said Ernie Knewitz, spokesman for Johnson & Johnson, in response to a request for comment.

There has been a great deal of discussion concerning tax reform these days, and many people are putting tax planning on hold until they see what Congress is actually going to do. Since that could take a lot of time and we don't know if any changes will actually occur, it makes more sense to plan now and adjust later if the world changes. Focus on what you know and what you can control, and don't worry about any changes until they actually occur.



L Brands shares have plummeted this year due to sales declines and poor financial guidance. The disappointing results are likely to continue, according to one Wall Street firm.
After being wrong with its bullish call for L Brands all year, Cowen gave up Wednesday and lowered its rating to market perform from outperform. The firm cited increased competition in the intimate apparel industry.
"We hope Victoria's Secret can ... stimulate demand to drive store traffic, and gain share in lingerie & sport; however, we see risk to comp and margin if L Brands does not achieve elevated pricing," analyst Oliver Chen wrote in a note to clients.
"Victoria's Secret needs to rebalance the assortment in their core lingerie offering after the shift toward Bralettes & Sport last year pressured Average Unit Retail," he added.
L Brands is the owner of Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works. Its stock has underperformed the market this year with its shares down 40 percent through Tuesday, compared with the S&P 500's 12 percent return.
Chen said Victoria's Secret is losing market share to competitors like the American Eagle-owned Aerie brand, which grew its lingerie and bra sales by 26 percent in the second quarter. L Brands has reported sales declines in the last two quarters. Chen also mentioned the increasing sports bra competition from Nike and Under Armour.
The analyst lowered his price target for L Brands to $39 from $40, roughly even with Tuesday's $39.23 closing price.
"We believe LB is in the midst of transformational change, and we worry the stock and valuation could be sideways if risk to store traffic and bra pricing persists," he wrote.
L Brands did not immediately respond to a request for comment for this story.

Though hedge funds often signal a freewheeling, shoot-from-the-hip investment style, for the most part these investment vehicles aim to dampen volatility. They do it by using various strategies that are supposed to provide protection from market volatility and sometimes even positive returns during market declines.
"Someone who is concerned about the downside may want to allocate to hedge funds in case there is a big meltdown in the markets," said Tayfun Icten, an analyst with research firm Morningstar, who follows hedge funds.
But along with that important positive come a whole host of drawbacks. Which might make you think twice about hedge funds.
It also should be noted that the Securities and Exchange Commission requires individuals to qualify as accredited investors to use hedge funds. At a minimum, they must have annual income of $200,000 and net worth above $1 million.


Todd Gordon thinks the market rally is about to cool off, but he's got a way to play the S&P 500 in case that happens.
"Markets don't always go up or down," the TradingAnalysis.com founder said Tuesday on CNBC's "Trading Nation." Sometimes "they go sideways, and you can actually use that sideways consolidation to your advantage."
On a chart of the S&P 500-tracking ETF (SPY), Gordon points out that just over a year ago, the market "settled down into a correction" that lasted about three months after a nice run-up in the early summer. Since the election, SPY has surged 17 percent, and the long run-up has Gordon suspecting that another slowdown to the rally is on the way.
"This sell-off into the election rally in November lasted approximately three months," said Gordon. "So we might be headed into a period of consolidation, and you can use the options market to your advantage and benefit from that."

To play such a consolidation, Gordon is using a "butterfly" options put spread. Such a trade involves selling two puts in the middle of the market's expected range, while buying one higher-strike put and one lower-strike put. The structure is designed to show maximum returns if the underlying stock or ETF is in the middle of the range upon expiration.
In this case, Gordon is selling two of the November monthly 250-strike puts, buying one November monthly 257-strike put, and buying one November monthly 243-strike put for a total cost of $2.50 per share, or $250 per options spread.
The way the trade is set up, Gordon would make a maximum profit of about $450 if the SPY closes at exactly $250 on the Nov. 17 expiration. But since the trade has two break-even points, at $254.50 and at $245.50, Gordon would make money so long as SPY closes within that range.
The maximum loss, on the other hand, is the $250 paid.
Since Gordon won't make the maximum profit unless SPY closes right at $250, the trader recommends getting out of the trade at a certain point.
"What I recommend you do is as you spend $250, once you start to get to $250 in profit, begin to take that trade off," he said. "Don't go for the home run and try and get that $250 pin at expiration."
As of early Wednesday, SPY was at $250.05, which is just below its all-time high of $250.32.


Check out which companies are making headlines before the bell:
FedEx: FedEx has lowered its 2018 earnings guidance to account for the impact of a cyberattack. The shipping company also said on Tuesday that Hurricane Harvey impacted its fiscal first-quarter results. FedEx now expects earnings of between $11.05 and $11.85 per share, below its previous projection for earnings of between $12 and $12.80 per share.
Adobe: Adobe Systems reported third-quarter earnings after the bell on Tuesday that topped Wall Street estimates. However, the marketing software firm delivered a mixed outlook, causing shares to dip after hours.
Bed Bath & Beyond:  Shares of Bed Bath & Beyond fell more than 14 percent in premarket trading, as the home goods retailer slashed its full year outlook on Tuesday and missed earnings estimates for the second quarter. Same-store sales — a metric closely watched by Wall Street for retail stocks — also came in lower than expected. Wal-Mart: The big-box retailer announced that this year it will be giving its existing employees the opportunity to work extra hours during the holiday season, rather than offering those hours to seasonal workers. "These extra hours will help staff traditional roles like cashier and stocker, and newly created technology-empowered positions such as personal shoppers and Pickup associates," said Judith McKenna, Walmart's chief operating officer. Meantime, retail rival Target is bringing 100,000 temporary workers on board ahead of the holidays.
Amazon: The internet giant is reportedly working on its first wearable device — a pair of "smart glasses," according to the Financial Times. The device would be capable of interacting with Amazon's Alexa, the report said, citing people familiar with the company's plans.
L Brands: L Brands, the parent company of Victoria's Secret, was downgraded by Cowen & Co., which cited "fundamental new competition in the sport bra market," among other obstacles in retail. Cowen analyst Oliver Chen said the company must add more digital components to its brick-and-mortar locations in order to "stimulate demand to drive store traffic."
Pfizer: Pfizer was upgraded to "overweight" from "equal-weight" at Morgan Stanley. The firm cited investors underappreciating the global prospects for Pfizer's "No. 1 growth driver," as it relates to breast cancer, and "M&A optionality." The prospect of U.S. tax reform offers additional optionality, Morgan Stanley analyst David Risinger said.
Mattel: The toymaker's stock is beginning to rebound after investors traded off shares ahead of Toys R Us — one of its biggest retail partners — filing for bankruptcy. Hasbro and Jakks Pacific are among some of the other vendors for Toys R Us that have watched their stocks tumble over the past few weeks. Now, though, with more certainty about Toys R Us' plans ahead of the holidays, toy manufacturers have less to worry about, analysts are saying.
WATCH: Fidelity: Watch the dots in today's Fed decision


Globetrotters, rejoice!
While the S&P 500 has performed well this year, with the index of U.S. large-cap stocks rising nearly 12 percent to hit a series of record highs, international equities have performed even better.
The popular iShares ETF tied to the MSCI EAFE index and known by its EFA ticker has surged almost 19 percent in 2017. The ETF tracks large stocks from developed markets outside the U.S. and Canada.
Its impressive performance comes after three-straight negative years. In fact, if the year closes with the EFA outpacing the S&P 500 ETF (SPY) by the current 6.8 points, the internationally focused ETF would have logged its most dramatic outperformance since 2006.
The 2017 run represents "a reversion to the mean," said Boris Schlossberg of BK Asset Management, referring to the supposed tendency of one year's underperformers to outperform, and vice versa.
"Whether this reversion to the mean continues? That answer, I think, is yes," Schlossberg added Tuesday on CNBC's "Power Lunch." "They are early on in the recovery cycle."
"I think the bet here is to go long ETA and short S&P, if you want to do a long-short trade," Schlossberg said.
While Craig Johnson, unlike Schlossberg, is bullish on U.S. stocks, the chief market technician at Piper Jaffray agrees that "I want to stay long the international socks, because I think that the outperformance is going to continue for a while longer."
This assessment is "just based on the charts," which show increasing momentum for the EFA, he said.
Within the ETF, the biggest country component is Japan, with a nearly 23 percent weighting, followed by the United Kingdom at 18 percent, France at 11 percent and Germany at 10 percent.


All major indexes are sitting at record highs, but for those looking for what could cause the next downdraft, one strategist says they are missing the big picture.
"I think if you talk to investors and you listen to the narrative, it's all about one macro risk point to another," Joe Zidle said Tuesday on CNBC's "Futures Now.""Yet the markets climb higher and people are asking how can this be. Well the simple answer is we are seeing earnings reflate, not only in the U.S. but all around the world in a way that we haven't seen since the days prior to the credit bubble," which was followed by the financial crisis.
In other words, earnings are going to drive the market higher. Consequently, the Richard Bernstein Advisors portfolio strategist encourages investors to get into cyclical sectors like tech, financials and consumer discretionary given that he believes earnings are going through a reflation period. Cyclicals are the best bet in this type of environment, according to Zidle, because they are "most sensitive to changes in that profit cycle."
As a result, the strategist sees these cyclical sectors staying strong until the end of the year. So far, the tech sector has surged 22 percent in 2017, with financials picking up steam to rally more than 8 percent so far this year. Consumer discretionary stocks have also climbed almost 10 percent year to date.
Better-than-expected earnings are a big factor in the market rally this year. The S&P 500 is up about 12 percent, the Nasdaq has risen 20 percent and the Dow, which closed at another all-time high on Tuesday, has surged 13 percent.

Cybersecurity, health of the global economy, energy price shock and terrorist attacks are some of the top risks that concern businesses and may threaten their ability to operate, according to results from a new survey by the World Economic Forum (WEF) published Wednesday.
The survey, conducted annually by the WEF's strategic partners Marsh & McLennan Companies and Zurich Insurance Group, highlighted the following ten risks that businesses are presently concerned about:
While concerns about the overall health of the global economy continue to dominate the list, the report found concerns around cybersecurity risks rising in importance.
"Business leaders in many of world's largest economies now rank cyber as their top risk," John Drzik, president of Marsh Global Risk & Digital, said in a press statement. "Companies need to rigorously analyze how these threats could impact their operations and take appropriate risk mitigation and resiliency measures."


Global asset prices are "possibly the most elevated" in history, Deutsche Bank strategists said in a sweeping new report about the frequency of financial crises and shocks throughout history.
This kind of "gross overvaluation in both equities and bonds" is of particular concern right now to Boris Schlossberg, managing director of foreign exchange strategy at BK Asset Management. He says investors may soon face an unexpected shock as central banks look to normalize monetary policy years after the financial crisis.
In one portion of the report, titled "The Next Financial Crisis," the strategists led by Jim Reid explained what they found to be historically "stretched" values in both equities and government bonds in a handful of global developed markets.
The report's authors examined stock valuations through an equal-weighted index of 15 developed markets' government bonds and 15 developed markets' equity markets from 1800 to the present. For government bonds, the strategists looked at where nominal yields are currently trading relative to history and arranged the data in percentiles. For stocks, current prices were compared with each respective country's nominal GDP.

Schlossberg said Deutsche Bank's conclusion is "extremely valid," and further, that the scenario in which both asset classes are highly overvalued is highly unusual.
"Typically you could have overvaluation in equities, or in bonds, but not both at the same time. It's almost like a historical unicorn event," he said Tuesday on "Trading Nation."
The fact that both are overvalued "may set investors up for a nasty shock," Schlossberg wrote to CNBC.
Schlossberg says the situation can be directly pinned on quantitative easing and other easy-money central bank policies.
Of course, the unwinding of the central bank's balance sheet, which was built up due to the Fed's attempt to bolster the economy in the wake of the financial crisis, is widely expected to be one of the key topics at the Federal Reserve's meeting this week.





Nike sneakers are piling up on retailers' shelves due to poor demand, according to one Wall Street firm.
Susquehanna lowered its rating for Nike shares to neutral from positive on Tuesday, citing increasing promotional activity for its shoes.
"The performance of key marquee basketball product has slowed, as Nike continues to barrage the market with launch product. Additionally, checks with industry sources indicate Nike continues to force premium wholesale accounts (tier zero accounts) to buy large allotments of in-line/tertiary product, compounding the oversupply issue," analyst Sam Poser wrote in a note to clients.
"We have no doubt that Nike management recognizes this and is in the process of correcting the inventory glut. However, oversupply, partially due to lack of innovation within the basketball category, is not something that will be corrected overnight."
Nike has underperformed the market this year with its shares up 5 percent through Monday, compared with the S&P 500's 12 percent return.
The analyst lowered his price target for Nike to $54 from $64, representing 1 percent upside from Monday's close.
Poser noted that Foot Locker's website revealed 60 percent to 70 percent of Nike's and the company's Jordan-branded basketball shoes are being discounted.
"Recent proprietary checks indicate an inordinate amount of signature basketball (KDs, Lebrons, Kobe) and, to a lesser extent, Jordan retro product is being sold at Nike Factory stores," he wrote. "Nike appears to have misjudged the appetite for some key marquee basketball product."
Nike did not immediately respond to a request for comment for this story.

T-Mobile shares rallied more than 4 percent Tuesday after CNBC's David Faber reported that the telecom giant and Sprint were in advanced merger talks.
"This was a name that was long rumored [to be in] deal talks with Sprint," Dan Nathan of RiskReversal.com told CNBC's "Fast Money" on Monday. The rumor sent the options market into a frenzy this week, with one trader cashing in on Tuesday's report.
"Call volume exploded … [seeing] 10 times the average daily call volume [on Monday]," said Nathan.
In one eye-catching trade, there was an apparent purchase of 20,000 of the October 67.5-strike calls for 32 cents. Those calls have nearly tripled in value and are now worth $1 each. In just one day, that trader made more than $1.2 million in profit on the trade.

Looking at a chart of T-Mobile, Nathan noted that "the stock has cooled off, and if you look to the upside ... this [stock] could get going if that deal gets done sooner." T-Mobile shares are up more than 10 percent this year.
T-Mobile shares were trading at the $64.35 range midday Tuesday.





Amid devastating hurricanes, North Korean missile launches and political upheaval in Washington, equities in the U.S. simply keep jitterbugging their way toward fresh peaks. For 8½ years now, every dip has been followed by a push past the previous high.
Yet at some point, even as investors continue reaping the benefits of a market climb that's been fattening wallets and retirement accounts along the way, the party will come to an end. And if you haven't yet given thought to how a long-lasting stock slump could impact your nest egg, now's the time.
"The obvious is that the market will correct," said Greg Hammer, president of Hammer Financial Group in Schererville, Indiana. "It's just a matter of when and by how much."


The Federal Reserve is on the cusp of reversing the most ambitious monetary stimulus program in world history amid questions over how much impact it really delivered.
There's little question that the program, known as quantitative easing or "money printing," boosted the stock market. The three iterations of QE between November 2008 and October 2014 each saw big boosts to the market, with a cumulative S&P 500 gain from beginning to end, including the various down periods between each leg, of about 140 percent.
The economic impacts, though, are less clear.
For most of the period, GDP struggled to gain more than 2 percent. Wealth disparity grew, income gains were hard to come by and the Fed continually came up short on its inflation goal.
With the U.S. central bank likely to announce this week that it will start unwinding its $4.5 trillion balance sheet of bonds and other securities, much of which accumulated in the QE era, the debate about the program's impact continues.
In fact, one of the Fed's own economists recently penned a report indicating that QE has come up short of its goals.
"Evaluating the effects of monetary policy is difficult, even in the case of conventional interest rate policy,"  St. Louis Fed economist Stephen D. Williamson wrote. "With respect to QE, there are good reasons to be skeptical that it works as advertised, and some economists have made a good case that QE is actually detrimental."


Oil markets could receive another blow on Wednesday when the U.S. government reports oil stocks data that are expected to show a build in crude oil stocks, largely as a result of Hurricane Harvey damaging U.S. oil refineries in late August.
In a preview of the U.S. Energy Information Administration's (EIA) weekly oil stocks data, due on Wednesday, S&P Global Platts said the data was likely to show a build in U.S. crude stocks of 2.4 million barrels in the last week.
"An expected rebound in U.S. crude imports could have offset higher refinery utilization last week, likely leading to another build in crude stocks for the third straight reporting period," S&P Global Platts said in its preview released on Monday after carrying out a survey of analysts.
Over the two weeks ending September 8, crude stocks rose 10.5 million barrels, Geoffrey Craig, S&P Global Platts' oil futures editor noted, adding that most of the build was due to Hurricane Harvey's damaging oil refinery infrastructure and a lack of U.S. export capability due to the extreme weather.
"A major driver behind inventory movements since Hurricane Harvey has been U.S. Gulf Coast refinery utilization, which sunk to 60.7 percent the week ending September 8, down from 96 percent of capacity two weeks prior to that," Craig said, adding: "US inventory data will reflect post-Hurricane Harvey adjustments for another few weeks, at a minimum, as Gulf Coast refiners, terminals and ports continue the process of returning to normal."
Craig noted that although refineries were starting to return to normal, crude oil prices were likely to be suppressed by "an influx of U.S. crude imports that will probably materialize as tankers sitting in the Gulf of Mexico waiting for shut Texas refineries to reopen get to offload their cargoes."


T-Mobile and Sprint are in active talks about a merger, according to people close to the situation.
Both companies and their parents, Deutsche Telekom and Softbank, have been in frequent conversations about a stock-for-stock merger in which T-Mobile parent Deutsche Telekom would emerge as the majority owner.
People close to the situation stress that negotiators are still weeks away from finalizing a deal and believe the chances of reaching an agreement are not assured. The two sides have not yet set an exchange ratio for a deal, but are currently engaged in talks to hammer out a term sheet.
The companies declined to comment on the report.
T-Mobile and Sprint have had a seemingly endless dalliance over the years since Softbank took control of Sprint, pushed by the prospect of billions of dollars in cost synergies that a merger would bring. The last time the two companies held meaningful talks earlier this year, Softbank's Masayoshi Son indicated a willingness to sell Sprint to T-Mobile.
This time, given the all-stock nature contemplated, Softbank would emerge as a large minority holder in any combination. While T-Mobile CEO John Legere is expected to lead any combination that results from a merger, Son has made it clear he wants a say in how the company is run. That desire adds another layer of complexity to an already difficult transaction.
T-Mobile has not begun due diligence on Sprint, yet another step that could change current price expectations or the willingness to move forward.
The biggest issue is whether any merger between the No. 3 and No. 4 wireless carriers in the nation would be approved by antitrust regulators. The risk of rejection by the Department of Justice will play an important role in the final decision made by both sides as to whether they will proceed with a deal.
Given Softbank's high level of engagement on a Sprint-T-Mobile deal, its quixotic campaign to try to buy Charter Communications has slowed considerably. The effort is on hold. CNBC has reported it involved the creation of a new company infused with vast amounts of equity and debt to buy Charter at a premium and the 17 percent of Sprint that Softbank does not own. Dutch telecom company Altice has been actively soliciting funds to mount its own bid for Charter should Softbank make a move.


Apple's products are so good, they are apparently immune to the normal laws of economics.
Morgan Stanley on Tuesday raised its 12- to 18-month price target on Apple to $194 from $182, as the firm sees the higher prices as positive, not a negative like some other research firms on Wall Street.
"Innovation-led price increases historically boost, rather than hinder, Apple demand," wrote Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty in Tuesday's note to clients.
She explains further:
"Apple is an aspirational brand offering high quality, innovative products at a premium price. As a result, the company escapes the typical trend of declining prices that drive demand for other devices. In fact, demand for iPhone is directly correlated to the direction of ASPs - higher prices, higher demand and vice versa."
Her new price forecast represents 22 percent upside from Monday's close.  Apple's stock is 0.6 percent higher in premarket trading.
Huberty's raised her 2018 revenue forecast to $301 billion, 14 percent higher than the Wall Street consensus.
Morgan Stanley also noted the extreme loyalty of Apple customers, which is showing signs of increasing from already high levels.
"According to our April 2017 AlphaWise US Smartphone survey, Ninety-two percent of US iPhone users who plan to upgrade their phone in the next year plan to repurchase an iPhone, up from 86% the year before."
Apple last week announced its latest lineup of iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch technology, which all include shiny new price tags. The highly-anticipated iPhone X, which introduces new face recognition technology in Apple's most expensive smartphone, will be sold for a $999, $50 more than Morgan Stanley estimated.
The shares have fallen in the wake of the new product announcements, in part over concern about the higher prices.


Shares of two big-name retailers on the comeback trail just got upgraded by Wall Street analysts.
Oppenheimer raised its rating on Michael Kors to outperform. The firm also hiked its price target on the stock to $55, which is 23 percent higher than Monday's $44.65 closing price.

Credit Suisse upgraded upgrade Gap to neutral from underperform. Its new price target on the stock is $30, just 7 percent higher than Monday's $27.90 closing price.
Both stocks have seen some life in the last three months. Kors shares are up 30 percent since June, while Gap shares have jumped 23 percent. By comparison, the S&P Retail Index is up just 2 percent in the last three months.
Oppenheimer's report upgrading Michael Kors is headlined "Retail turnaround just starting." The note said, "Margins seem to be finding the bottom, while sentiment is extremely negative." The analysts, Anna Andreeva and Samantha Lanman, also cite improvement at Jimmy Choo, a luxury shoe company Michael Kors is buying for $1.2 billion. Just Monday, shareholders of Jimmy Choo approved the sale.


Bridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio said Tuesday he is not a believer in cryptocurrencies.
"Bitcoin today you can't make much transactions in it. You can't spend it very easily," Dalio said on CNBC's "Squawk Box."
"It's not an effective storehold of wealth because it has volatility to it, unlike gold," the hedge fund founder added. "Bitcoin is a highly speculative market. Bitcoin is a bubble."
The investor said there are two important facets to being considered a valid currency: ease of transactions as a medium of exchange and being a "storehold of wealth."
"It's a shame, it could be a currency. It could work conceptually, but the amount of speculation that is going on and the lack of transactions [hurts it]," he said.
Dalio wrote about his life lessons and the initial failures during his career in his book entitled "Principles: Life and Work," available on Tuesday.
His firm currently manages about $160 billion, according to its website.
Dalio's negative comments come a week after JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon also took a shot at bitcoin, saying the cryptocurrency "is a fraud."
"It's just not a real thing, eventually it will be closed," Dimon said at the Delivering Alpha conference presented by CNBC and Institutional Investor.


Check out which companies are making headlines before the bell:
Equifax — The maligned credit reporting company's stock slipped 1.3 percent before the bell after it acknowledged that it faced another security issue earlier this year. On Sept. 7, Equifax reported a data breach that could affect 143 million U.S. consumers.
Tesla — Analysts at Jefferies initiated coverage of the stock with an "underperform" rating and a price target of $280 per share. That target represents a 27.3 percent downside potential from Monday's close of $385. Jefferies said in a note it expects losses to continue until 2020, adding Tesla still faces challenges in scaling its business.
Gap — The retailer's stock rose 2 percent in the premarket after analysts at Credit Suisse upgraded the stock to "neutral" from "underperform." They also raised their price target on Gap to $30 a share from $23. In a note, Credit Suisse cited the closing of about 200 "low-quality" stores, "an attractive valuation," and improvements in the company's supply chain.
AutoZone — AutoZone shares jumped 4 percent in the premarket after the company reported quarterly results that beat expectations. The company posted adjusted earnings per share of $15.18 on sales of $3.5 billion. Analysts polled by Reuters expected AutoZone to post a profit of $15.11 per share on revenue of $3.49 billion.
Michael Kors — Oppenheimer upgraded the stock to "outperform" and raised its price target $55 from $45 a share. "Margins seem to be finding the bottom, while sentiment is extremely negative," it said in a note.
Nike — The Dow component fell 1.5 percent before the bell after analysts at Susquehanna, lowered their rating to "neutral" from "positive." The analysts cited concerns that Nike's North America and Europe businesses are "decelerating as some key items, especially in the basketball category, have underperformed, leaving excess inventory in the marketplace."
Walgreens Boots Alliance, CVS — Analysts at RBC initiated both stocks with "outperform" ratings. For Walgreens, RBC said the company is primed for accelerating earnings growth as it "appears ready to harvest the rewards" of its efforts from the past two years. For CVS, RBC said the company is "at an inflection point in its corporate life cycle, as well as in the life cycle of the industry."
Kohl's — Kohl's said Tuesday it is offering free Amazon returns in 82 stores starting in October.


A daily morning look at the financial stories you need to know to start the day.
STOCKS/ECONOMY
-Stock futures are mixed after Monday's gains. We get housing starts and import/export price data this morning while the two-day Fed meeting begins today.
STORM WATCH
-Hurricane Maria is now a potentially catastrophic Category 5 storm, bearing down on Puerto Rico. It could hit the island on Wednesday and be the most powerful storm to slam Puerto Rico in 85 years.
NORTH KOREA THREAT/DEFENSE
-President Trump will reportedly use the strongest possible terms to call for international cooperation on North Korea during his U.N. speech today.


While market prices suggest less certainty, 76 percent of respondents to the CNBC Fed Survey believe the central bank will hike interest rates in December.
Various market-based gauges put the probability at 43 to 55 percent. On average, respondents to the survey see two to three hikes next year, and the Fed is forecast to finish its rate hike cycle in the second quarter of 2019 at a 2.9 percent rate.
The outlook for the Fed has been clouded by its plans to reduce its $4.5 trillion balance sheet, likely as soon as next month, and by inflation running below its 2 percent target. Meanwhile, more Fed officials have grown concerned about the impact of low rates on markets.
"The Fed is confronting two very different sides of inflation. Asset prices are rising too rapidly, while prices of goods and services are climbing too slowly,'' wrote Lynn Reaser, the chief economist at Point Loma Nazarene University in response to the survey. "Monetary policymakers will need to choose a side and any decision will entail large risks."
All the 42 respondents to the survey, who include economists, fund managers and strategists, believe the Fed won't hike at the meeting that begins Tuesday, and 68 percent say the central bank will begin reducing its $4.5 trillion balance sheet by October.
The balance sheet runoff is forecast to take 4.4 years to wind down to around $2.5 trillion. Reducing the balance sheet is viewed as a slight negative for economic growth, a bit worse for stocks. But overall, expectations are for only modestly negative effects.
Survey respondents see only modest effects on growth this year and next from the recent hurricanes and actually have dialed in more growth than they have subtracted. GDP is forecast to grow 2.2 percent this year and 2.6 percent in 2018. Most participants lowered their outlook for growth from the storms this year but raised it for next year by a greater amount.
"The hurricanes will mask the underlying trend in the economy but the Fed members are likely to consider the net impacts to be positive and move ahead with the rate and balance sheet normalization process," said Joel Naroff, president of Naroff Economic Advisors.
But some believe the Fed will be cautious this year. "The Fed wants to be careful when they begin the balance sheet normalization process and may not want to cloud the process with a December hike,'' wrote Mark Vitner, a managing director and senior economist at Wells Fargo Securities. "If they do not raise rates in December, we would expect more tightening in 2018. Our end point is the same regardless."
Overall, respondents think the Fed can let the economy run a bit hotter than it may believe. On average, the group said unemployment could shrink to 3.7 percent before sparking inflation. And 45 percent said they see little connection between unemployment and inflation, a relationship known as the Phillips curve — a principal way the Fed thinks about inflation: That is, low unemployment can drive up wages and inflation.
"The Phillips curve is dead," said Allen Sinai, chief global economist and strategist at Decision Economics, predicting "relatively low inflation for a long, long time because of technology."
The chance of recession is a relatively low 19 percent, down a bit from July, and protectionist trade policies are seen as the biggest threat to the U.S. economy followed by geopolitical risks.
Expectations for stock price gains this year and next continue to rise, with the S&P 500 forecast to hit 2,515 this year on average and 2,593 next year. It was around 2,500 in Tuesday's premarket. But the 10-year Treasury is forecast to end the year at just 2.42 percent, and not even hit 3 percent in 2018. It as at 2.218 percent early Tuesday.


Tesla's market-crushing performance this year will not last, according to one Wall Street firm.
Jefferies told its client to avoid the electric car maker's shares, saying the company's financial performance will be weak in the coming years.
"It is with a bit of a heavy heart that we initiate coverage of Tesla at underperform," analyst Philippe Houchois wrote in a note to clients Tuesday. "Achievements to-date and vision are impressive, but we don't think Tesla's vertically integrated business model can be scaled up as profitably and quickly as consensus thinks and valuation multiples imply."
The analyst set a 12-month price target for Tesla shares at $280, representing 27 percent downside from Monday's close.
Houchois predicts Tesla will continue to lose money on an annual basis through 2019. He has "doubts about Tesla's ability to generate 30+% gross [profit] margin required to support its vertically integrated business model in distribution/supercharging."
The electric car maker's shares are outperforming the market this year, up 80 percent year to date through Monday compared with the S&P 500's 12 percent return.
"Given capital intensity, we don't think DCF [discounted cash flow] can justify the current valuation, let alone upside," he wrote. "We appreciate the growth upside from a brand whose reach goes well beyond auto markets and that valuing Tesla today assumes some form of 'steady-state' that is unlikely to happen anytime soon."
Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Its shares are down 2 percent in the Tuesday premarket session after the call.— CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed to this story.


Financials rallied back to their mid-August highs on Monday, and TradingAnalysis.com founder Todd Gordon says JPMorgan is one big bank that could see a bounce.
The basic call is pinned on what Gordon sees happening in the bond market.
"The financials are acting quite strong as bonds are threatening a breakdown, so you could find potentially higher rates," he explained Monday on CNBC's "Trading Nation."
To illustrate his point, on a chart of TLT, the ETF that tracks long-term Treasury bonds, Gordon draws a line connecting TLT's lows over the past few months. The drop in TLT this month has Gordon predicting that the ETF could actually fall down back to that line at around $125.
"If you were to see a break [through $125], that is lower bonds, [it would mean] higher yields and that is going to give a much-needed boost to financials," he said.

What's more, the chart of the XLF financials-tracking ETF is showing bullish technical signs as well, according to Gordon. He points to an "inverse head and shoulders" pattern as proof that XLF could bounce back to its early August highs near $25.50.

A similar "inverse head and shoulders" pattern has also appeared in the chart of JPMorgan in particular, says Gordon, serving as one of the indicators that has the trader betting on a breakout for the bank. In addition, Gordon believes JPMorgan is completing another bullish pattern known as a "bull flag," which suggests to him that the bank stock will rally back to its previous August highs.
"It does look like we are breaking up through the $92 region, and we're going to go ahead for a retest of $95," he said.

Since Gordon sees JPMorgan bouncing 2 percent from Monday's levels, he is buying the October monthly 92-strike calls and selling the October monthly 95-strike calls for about $1.23, or $123 per options spread. If JPMorgan closes above $95 on Oct. 20 expiration, Gordon would make a maximum profit of about $177. But if JPMorgan were to close below $92, then he would lose the $123 he paid to make the trade.
In order to avoid such a loss, Gordon establishes a point to get out of the trade.
"The $1.23 that I just laid out in premium, if that gets cut in half to about 61 cents or 62 cents, [I'm going to] go ahead and cut the trade," said Gordon.
With Monday's rally in the financials, JPMorgan is up almost 8 percent year to date.

Investors are seeking to raise more than $1 billion from seven initial public offerings this week, the most active week for IPOs since at least June. Three Chinese companies are set to debut, led by Best Inc., an Alibaba-backed logistics company initially seeking to raise $869 million, the biggest IPO of the quarter.
Overnight, it was reported that Best Inc. cut the deal size to $472.5 million at the midpoint, down from $869 million.
Next week will be strong as well, with two tech companies coming: Roku, which is seeking to raise $204 million at a valuation of $1.5 billion, and used-car service CarGurus (from the founder of TripAdvisor), seeking to raise at least $100 million with a likely valuation of roughly $1 billion.
It's happening again: the IPO market is heating up. It's happened a couple times in the last year, only to peter out. But with markets at new highs and recent IPOs performing well, the market is again opening up. Whether it lasts is still uncertain.
There's certainly no shortage of prospects: at least 150 tech unicorns (those companies with valuations over $1 billion) are waiting to go public.
The biggest deal this week — and the biggest IPO of the quarter — is Alibaba-backed Chinese logistics firm Best Inc, which will seek to begin trading at the NYSE on Wednesday. The delivery business is big in China, but Best is fifth in a very competitive market. It's still unprofitable, according to Renaissance Capital, and its competitor, ZTO Express, is not exactly offering great comfort. It went public in October 2016 at $19.50, and is now at $14.89 at the NYSE.
Also from China this week: Secoo Holding. Luxury goods is a hot space in China. Secoo makes a market for pre-owned luxury goods, a space that Alibaba and JD.com have also been trying to enter (read: serious competition). They'll be seeking to raise $106 million and are scheduled to begin trading Friday at the Nasdaq.
Rounding out the China offerings is biotech firm Zia Lab, seeking to raise $100 million.
Also scheduled to trade Wednesday at the NYSE is Despegar, an online travel company based in Buenos Aires. They're backed by Expedia, Tiger Global and General Atlantic (Expedia provides the hotel inventory outside of Latin America). Online travel in Latin America is highly fragmented, but they are a leader, with 11 percent market share.
Finally, it's been a miserable year for energy IPOs, as the market fizzled when oil collapsed in March. That's when Hess Mainstream, a master limited partnership (MLP) that owns oil and gas pipelines, went public.
No one has wanted much to do with energy stocks — IPOs or listed — since then.
But with oil near $50, it's time to try again. On Thursday, Oasis Midstream, a spinoff of Oasis Petroleum, will be the latest to try, seeking to raise $150 million at the NYSE. The attraction, as with most MLP's, is the juicy 7.5 percent yield. They own oil and natural gas pipelines primarily in the Williston Basin in eastern Montana, western North Dakota, South Dakota, and southern Saskatchewan
Why the sudden interest in IPOs? Two factors: markets are again at new highs, and investors have been encouraged by the after-market trading in IPOs that have gone public in the last year.
I know, Blue Apron and Snap have been failures. But Kathleen Smith, of IPO research firm Renaissance Capital, points out that those have been the exception to the rule. Her Renaissance Capital IPO ETF (IPO), a basket of the largest 60 most recent IPOs, is up 27 percent this year.
Many of those stocks have had big out-performance this year:
Recent Top IPO performers (YTD)
Ferrari (RACE) +89%
Square (SQ) +109%
First Data (FDC) +27%
Atlassian (TEAM) +50%
MGM Growth Properties (MGP) +21%
The message: while public investors drive a hard bargain and want initial prices as low as possible, investors have been rewarded. For every Blue Apron and Snap, there are more winners.
That is not lost on those seeking to come to market.


A fresh bout of volatility could be here for stocks, if history is any indication.
CNBC analysis using Kensho found that the S&P 500 has traded lower 70 percent of the time during the last two weeks of September since 1980. In that time, the index's average return has been negative 1.3 percent, the analysis found.

"The summer doldrums are coming to an end," said Ryan Detrick, senior market strategist at LPL Financial, in a phone interview with CNBC. "There's also a lot of book clearing ahead of the fourth quarter. The fourth quarter is the strongest one on average" for the S&P 500.
The S&P 500 is up 1.4 percent this month and currently sits at a record high. But there are reasons why September could still live up to its dreadful reputation in the stock market.
First, the Federal Reserve will likely start the process of unwinding its $4.5 trillion balance sheet after a two-day meeting this week.  The central bank accrued most of its massive portfolio during the financial crisis.
This will be the first time a central bank attempts an unwinding of this magnitude. In the past, smaller balance-sheet reductions have sparked recessions.
"This tightening cycle is about to ramp up with liquidity being drawn each and every month and by another higher increment after 3-month intervals until at some point $50 billion per month of liquidity will suddenly disappear," said Peter Boockvar, chief market analyst at The Lindsey Group, in a note.
Boockvar also said he "will scream from some mountaintop ... that I was dead wrong" if the Fed pulls off its balance-sheet unwinding along with raising rates and the stock market keeps rising.
Another reason September could still be dangerous for investors is tension between the U.S. and North Korea.
Last week, the isolated Asian nation launched a missile that flew over Japan before landing in the sea. The launch took place after the U.N. Security Council unanimously imposed a ban on North Korea's textile exports and capped its crude oil imports.
"In an environment where markets have scarcely reacted to recent terrorist attacks, the recent string of North Korean news has captured investors' attention," said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank.
"The increased frequency, power and pretentiousness exhibited by these tests seem to confirm what governments have long feared: North Korea is closer than ever to its goal of building a military arsenal that can viably target both U.S. troops in Asia and the U.S. homeland," Ablin said.


Citron Research's Andrew Left, who gained notoriety for successful bets against companies such as Valeant Pharmaceuticals, called Ubiquiti Networks a "fraud" during a televised interview Monday.
"The word 'fraud' I use very judiciously,"  the short-seller said in an exclusive interview on CNBC's "Halftime Report."
"I think when you look at all these red flags it doesn't take a CFA, you don't have to go to a top business school, you sit down and read the Citron report, and you'll conclude, 'Oh my God, this company must be a fraud," he added.
The company makes wireless networking products. Its CEO is Robert Pera, majority owner of the Memphis Grizzlies.
Left said it will be interesting to see what happens next month when Pera has an option to buy the rest of the NBA team, which will require more due diligence on his company by the league.
"The more sunlight you put on a fraud, the more chance it has of being exposed," Left said.
Shares of Ubiquiti plunged 10 percent after the short seller released his bearish report on the company Monday morning.

"Citron believes Ubiquiti story is unraveling as we write," Left wrote on his Citron Research website. "The end is now for the Ubiquiti Fraud. What was once a company with unique products in a fragmented space has turned into a company that sells products in highly competitive markets where they are the last mover."
Pera replied to the earlier Citron tweet with his own, saying, "My apologies to those affected by these clowns."

When asked for official comment, Ubiquiti referred CNBC to the CEO's Twitter response. The company will have an investor update featuring Pera on Sept. 26.
Left also questioned the company's use of distributors in the report saying, "Ubiquiti's financials don't reconcile with its distributors." He said Morgan Stanley recently dropped research coverage of the company.
"Like many of the frauds that Citron has uncovered in the past, the cash balances claimed by Ubiquiti do not generate reconcilable interest income," he wrote.
When asked if he is short the stock by CNBC, Left replied in an email, "What do you think?"


McDonald's just had its worst week of the year, and a top technician says the charts point to more pain ahead.
The fast-food giant is one of the best-performing Dow stocks this year — soaring nearly 30 percent. Despite the strong performance this year, McDonald's has now fallen more than 2 percent from its recent high, hit on Sept. 11. It has lagged rivals such as Wendy's, Shake Shack and Chipotle, which were up 10 percent, 6 percent and 3 percent respectively during that time.
There was "bad action this week, and looks to me like it's the beginning of more bad action [for McDonald's]," Carter Worth of Cornerstone Macro said Friday on CNBC's "Options Action."

McDonald's has outperformed the S&P 500 and Russell 3000 restaurant index for the past three years, while "restaurants have been a real dud. You got three years, and you've got nothing to show for it," Worth said.
However, some of the laggards in the restaurant space are starting to show some life, and "McDonald's is giving way a little bit," Worth said.

Over the past year, "McDonald's is starting to hook down ever so slightly while the restaurants are starting to hook up. I'm going to make the bet that this is going to continue to happen," Worth said.
"My guess is that we're just going to check back to trend, so I want to fade McDonald's here. If I'm long, I want to take profits. If I'm a short-seller, I think you get a nice five to eight percent sell-off."
McDonald's was trading at the $157.41 range midday Monday.


The mining equipment market will grow next year, and that will boost Caterpillar's business, according to one Wall Street firm.
UBS raised its rating for Caterpillar shares to buy from neutral, citing positive results from the firm's survey of the industry's spending plans. The stock rose 2 percent to a record high after the UBS report.
We upgrade Caterpillar "to reflect our new evidence that a continuation of the earnings upcycle is ahead and that CAT's growing cash position will drive upside to earnings and returns as it gets deployed," analyst Steven Fisher wrote in a note to clients Monday. "Our UBS Evidence Lab Macro analysis suggests a re-acceleration of US private construction activity, and our UBS Evidence Lab survey indicates that mining capex should continue to improve in 2018."
Fisher raised his Caterpillar price target to $140 from $116, representing 15 percent upside from Friday's close.
Fisher said a UBS survey of 50 mining companies found that 60 percent intend to spend more next year for new mining equipment.
"UBS equipment rental surveys remain positive for business conditions and pricing," he wrote.
As a result, Fisher raised his 2018 earnings per share estimate for Caterpillar to $7.50 from $5.90. He also forecasts the company will generate nearly $10 billion of cash flow in total after capital expenditures and dividends from 2018 to 2020.
"We think the fundamental setup on the stock is as strong as it has been in several years. All its major segments are now growing," Fisher said in an interview on CNBC's "Power Lunch" Monday. "We've seen commodity prices that support [Caterpillar's] business remain stronger than expected."
Caterpillar stock is up 31 percent year to date through Friday versus the S&P 500's 12 percent return.

Brad McMillan — who counsels independent financial advisors representing $114 billion in assets under management — told CNBC on Monday that the stock market is way overvalued.
"The market probably would have to drop somewhere between 30 and 40 percent to get to fair value, based on historical standards," said McMillan, chief investment officer at Massachusetts-based Commonwealth Financial Network.
The Dow Jones industrial average and the S&P 500 closed at record highs Friday. The Dow had its best week of the year. The Nasdaq hit a trading high during the session on Friday, but just missed ending at a record.
Part of McMillan's thesis is rooted in his belief that the lofty levels of the so-called FANG stocks — Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google-parent Alphabet — seem reminiscent of the dot-com bubble in the late 1990s.
"I've been saying for about the past year, this year looks a lot like 1999 to me,"  McMillan said on "Squawk Box." "If you look at the underlying economics [and] if look at the stock market, the similarities are remarkable."
The Nasdaq, which has numerous tech listings, accelerated to a multiyear rally all through 1999 and then peaked on March 10, 2000, at 5,132.52 during the trading session before closing that day at 5,048.62. The index then tanked over two years and subsequently languished. It took 15 years to get back over 5,000. The Nasdaq closed at 6,448 on Friday.
With that mind, McMillan said: "Take as much risk as you want now. But you should be aware that at some point the market is going to pull back."
But he said it's not going to happen right away. "Right now, a recession is a good ways away. And that's the engine for bear markets." A bear market is defined by a 20 percent decline from an index's recent peak.
The idea that tech stock valuations are approaching or eclipsing dot-com bubble levels is shared among other analysts on Wall Street.
However, McMillan's assertions that the overall stock market would be at fair value at prices as much as 40 percent lower than today appears to be an outlier.


In late February, early March, a debate developed concerning what factors actually drive bank stock prices. The vast majority in that debate argued that an increase in interest rates, positive stress tests, high levels of stock buybacks, easing banking regulations, and a strong bull market would continue to drive bank stock prices higher.
On the other side, a very small minority, including myself, argued forcefully that these factors were not the key to bank stock prices. The rally in these issues was over. The key would be the sale of high quality products. Translating this means that banks needed to sell more loans and those loans could not go bad.
Both sides in this argument obtained what they wanted. Every promise the bulls made about banking came true. My assumptions also came true. Loan volume continued to weaken and loan quality began to deteriorate.
The market made its judgment. Five of the six largest bank stocks fell in price from March 1 to the present. The XLF which monitors the price action of big financial institutions is down slightly or 1.9 percent. The KBW Nasdaq Bank Index, BKX which is a large index covering many more bank stocks, is down somewhat more or 5.6 percent. The S&P 500 is up 4.4 percent. The broader bank index has under performed the market by 10.0 percent.
So why were the banking bulls, to this point, so wrong?
Start with their view on interest rates; it simply made no sense. They argued that banks cannot make money when interest rates are low for long periods and that bank interest rate margins would be up sharply if the Fed raised rates. Yet from 2010 to 2016, interest rates were the lowest in recorded history and bank earnings went up in all but one of those years. Bank profits were at all-time record levels in 2013, 2015 and 2016.


Citron Research's Andrew Left, who gained notoriety for successful bets against companies such as Valeant Pharmaceuticals, on Monday posted a bearish report on Ubiquiti Networks.
Shares of Ubiquiti plunged 8 percent after the short seller released his report. The company makes wireless networking products and its CEO is Robert Pera, majority owner of the Memphis Grizzlies.

A company spokesperson officially declined to comment on the Citron report, but Pera replied to the Citron tweet with his own, saying, "My apologies to those affected by these clowns."

The short seller also questioned the company's use of distributors saying, "Ubiquiti's financials don't reconcile with its distributors." He also cited how Morgan Stanley recently dropped research coverage of the company.
"Like many of the frauds that Citron has uncovered in the past, the cash balances claimed by Ubiquiti do not generate reconcilable interest income," he wrote.
When asked if he is short the stock by CNBC, Left replied in an email, "What do you think?"


Cryptocurrencies are the new red state/blue state divide in America. StockTwits
There's one incredibly passionate group that believes in cryptocurrencies as the future of all money. There's another equally passionate group that thinks they're essentially a hoax.
They've also always been highly volatile, but last week took that to a whole new level.
At the start of last week, the total market capitalization for all cryptocurrencies tracked on coinmarketcap.com was $150 billion.
Then Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase, took the stage at CNBC's Delivering Alpha conference on Wednesday and called bitcoin a "fraud worse than tulip bulbs." That set off an enormous correction across all these digital currencies. At one point early Friday morning, the total market cap of all cryptocurrencies had contracted to $98 billion. Bitcoin itself — at the lows — had dropped 40 percent from its all-time highs. Yet, by later Friday, the total market cap of all cryptocurrencies had recovered to $120 billion. (It recovered even more over the weekend.)
Here are some guideposts to keep in mind going into this week:
The bottom line here is that I believe the future value of cryptocurrencies will continue to shine through and emerge. However, we might just be at the beginning of a much bigger pullback. Proceed with caution.

Central banks may one day need to issue their own cryptocurrencies, the Bank for International Settlements said in its latest quarterly review.
"Whether or not a central bank should provide a digital alternative to cash is most pressing in countries, such as Sweden, where cash usage is rapidly declining," the Sunday report said. "But all central banks may eventually have to decide whether issuing retail or wholesale [central bank cryptocurrencies] makes sense in their own context."
The report's argument in favor of digital currencies comes from two needs: anonymity for consumers and efficiency for institutions.
Cryptocurrencies like bitcoin don't need a third party to validate transactions, which are essentially instantaneous and irrevocable due to the currencies' blockchain technology.
Forms of money from the past, present and possible future

Source: Bank for International Settlements
The report comes as regulators remain divided on whether to officially recognize digital currencies like bitcoin as currencies or commodities, and if the institutions consider such a designation valid at all.
The central banks of Russia, Singapore and some other countries have announced experiments with digital currencies, while some researchers have proposed central bank tokens such as Fedcoin, the report noted. The bank was also quick to point out that the Federal Reserve has not endorsed Fedcoin and no central bank has officially launched a retail or wholesale-use digital currency.
However, bitcoin's exponential surge from a few cents seven years ago to around $4,000 has caught the attention of Wall Street and now, the Bank for International Settlements' 14-page report chose to look at digital coins through four properties of money: issuer, form, accessibility and transfer mechanism.
The report then defined a central bank cryptocurrency as "an electronic form of central bank money that can be exchanged in a decentralised manner known as peer-to-peer, meaning that transactions occur directly between the payer and the payee without the need for a central intermediary."
Bitcoin jumped 10 percent Monday to above $4,000, its highest since Wednesday and up more than 300 percent for the year, according to CoinDesk. The digital currency hit a record high of $5,013.91 on Sept. 2 before plunging 41 percent to the lows of the month after Chinese authorities announced a ban on new token sales and major Chinese bitcoin exchanges said they would close by the end of September.
In late July, Bank of America Merrill Lynch commodity and derivatives strategist Francisco Blanch said in a sweeping report that bitcoin still faces many challenges in becoming a globally accepted currency. The "crucial hurdle" is whether major financial institutions will accept the digital currency as collateral, Blanch said then.
To be sure, extreme caution is warranted for central banks wading into cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin and ethereum, the most prominent digital currencies, have been very volatile and sometimes hit by major hacks.
"Some of the risks are currently hard to assess," the report said. "For instance, at present very little can be said about the cyber-resilience of [central bank cryptocurrencies], something not touched upon in this short feature."


Tesla is often tipped as one of the most disruptive companies in the world, but one investor is shorting the California-based electric car maker given its sales in comparison to BMW.
Patrick Armstrong, managing partner at Plurimi Investment Managers, told CNBC Monday that, "Tesla is obviously leading the charge with electronic, electric cars. Rightly so, that's where the industry is going."
But Armstrong's notes pointed out that while Tesla sold 47,000 electric cars through to June, BMW's sales of plug in cars were 50,000 through to July. "BMW is not getting credit," Armstrong said.
In addition, Tesla remains loss making despite a surge in second-quarter revenues, while BMW saw net profit rise 14 percent in the same time period. Armstrong said that Tesla's negative earnings were "hard to justify."
Adding to his rationale, Armstrong questioned whether Tesla would become "the Apple of electric cars," arguing that the Elon Musk-led company "isn't going to end up with a monopoly position, governments aren't going to allow that."
"Tesla is great for consumers because cars are priced in a non-profitable way, but that is not great for shareholders as it won't crowd out competition in this industry," unlike Amazon's trajectory in the retail space, he added in his note.
Short interest swirling around Tesla's stock has caught CEO Musk's attention previously. In June this year, he posted a series of tweets addressing the issue.

Tesla is expected to unveil a new electric truck offering in late October.
BMW, meanwhile, is aiming to mass produce electric cars by 2020, with 12 different models by 2025.
Armstrong was also downbeat on another major disruptor stock, this time in the entertainment industry. He was short on Netflix, but long on Disney, arguing that the latter company is set for a bumper 2019 with releases in major franchises such as Frozen, Indiana Jones and Star Wars.
Disclaimer: Plurimi Investment Managers holds short positions in Tesla and Netflix and long positions in BMW and Disney.


As the Fed starts unwinding the stimulus it provided to snap the economy back to life, two types of companies should benefit: banks and those with lower debt than their peers, according to a Goldman Sachs analysis.
Following its two-day meeting this week, the central bank is expected to announce that it will begin rolling off parts of its $4.5 trillion balance sheet. The term refers to the portfolio of mostly Treasurys and mortgage-backed securities, the bulk of which the Fed acquired in an effort to stimulate growth that had been stunted by the financial crisis.
No other central bank ever has undertaken a balance sheet reduction at this level. In the past, even smaller moves often have resulted in recession.
However, David Kostin, Goldman's chief equity strategist, thinks the market effect overall likely won't be dramatic, but the balance sheet operation will put upward pressure on rates, which in turn could take the shine off a stellar bull market rally this year.
"Given the well-choreographed and gradual adjustment, we expect that asset markets will avoid another 'taper tantrum,' the sharp and disruptive rise in yields that occurred in 2013," Kostin wrote in a note to clients.
The "tantrum" occurred after then-Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke warned that the central bank soon would be halting its monthly bond purchases that were seen as a key driver behind the postcrisis bull market run.
Indeed, the Fed did halt the program, known as quantitative easing, in October 2014, but the market effects have been minimal. Government bond yields have held lower and the stock market has continued to post solid gains.
If current Chair Janet Yellen has her way, the same thing will happen with the balance sheet rolloff. The plan is for the Fed to allow $10 billion of the monthly proceeds it gets from the portfolio to run off at first, increasing in $10 billion quarterly increments until the total reaches $50 billion.
When all is said and done, the balance sheet probably will maintain a level that most economists believe will be between $2 trillion and $3 trillion.
Kostin sees bank stocks, "which no longer carry their post-election policy premium" as beneficiaries from the higher rates. Bank stocks jumped after President Donald Trump's election in November, but have tailed off through the year and underperformed the broader market.
With both the Fed balance sheet operation in gear — probably beginning in October — and deregulation moves likely to come to fruition, that has renewed interest in bank stocks. The KBW Nasdaq Bank Index has jumped about 4.5 percent since Sept. 7.
"In addition to the macro tailwind of higher rates, banks should benefit from regulatory changes that are currently not reflected in share prices," Kostin said. "After outperforming their macro drivers on hopes of deregulation in late 2016, bank stocks have now given back all of their earlier 'policy premium,' making them a particularly appealing opportunity."
Losers in the environment ahead are likely to be "bond proxy" stocks like utilities and those with low volatility, he added. The low-vol stocks have been popular this year and carry higher valuations, making them less attractive.
While the balance sheet runoff has been well-telegraphed, the market remains confused about the future path of rate hikes. Just a few weeks ago, the market was certain the Fed wouldn't hike anymore this year and likely would forestall further increases until mid-2018 at the earliest.
However, a recent uptick in inflation signs has changed that, with the market now pricing in better-than-even chance of a move before the end of 2017. Goldman expects another hike this year, then three more in 2018, well ahead of current expectations from traders.


Nvidia shares are surging as Wall Street is growing more bullish on the company's artificial intelligence opportunity.
Bank of America Merrill Lynch raised its price target for the chipmaker to the second highest among analyst firms, citing the company's product leadership in the gaming, data center and AI markets.
The move came two days after Evercore ISI analyst C.J. Muse raised his price target to a Street-high price target on a similar thesis.
"Our positive view on Nvidia is based on its underappreciated transformation from a traditional PC graphics chip vendor, into a supplier into high end gaming, enterprise graphics, cloud, accelerated computing and automotive markets," analyst Vivek Arya wrote in a note to clients Sunday.
"Similar to other large successful tech industries, we expect the $30bn AI chip market to also feature one dominant supplier – we think NVDA."
Nvidia shares opened up 3 percent on Monday. The stock reached an all-time high on Friday, closing at $180.11.
Arya reiterated his buy and "top pick" ratings for Nvidia shares. He raised his price target for the stock to $210 from $185, representing 17 percent upside from Friday's close. He now has the second highest price target on the stock out of more than 30 analysts, according to FactSet. Evercore's Muse is the highest with a $250 12-month forecast.
Bank of America predicts data center capital spending will rise 21 percent in 2018 from an estimated 16.5 percent in 2017. Arya also said Google's AI product is a specialized chip compared with Nvidia's more general purpose processor, which is easier to program for different tasks.
"Incumbency matters and Nvidia has a much wider AI/machine learning ecosystem that will be tough to match," he wrote.
Nvidia's stock is up 187 percent in the past 12 months through Friday compared with the S&P 500's 17 percent gain. That performance ranks No. 1 in the entire S&P 500, according to FactSet.
"Separately we note NVDA's first mover advantage and growing influence in the multi trillion $ healthcare industry where AI/deep learning is being used for predictive analytics, image scanning and pathology assessments," the analyst wrote. "Indeed about 50% of submitted papers at last week's Medical Imaging Computing conference (MICCAI) were on deep learning."


Check out which companies are making headlines before the bell:
Nvidia —Analysts at Bank of America/Merrill Lynch raised the chipmaker's price target to $210 from $185 a share. Merrill noted it expects Nvidia's cloud capital expenses to grow by 31 percent in the second half on a year-over-year basis and "growing influence in the multi trillion$ health-care industry where AI/deep learning is being used for predictive analytics, image scanning and pathology assessments."
Orbital ATK — Defense giant Northrop Grumman is buying Orbital for $9.2 billion in cash and debt. Orbital shareholders will receive all-cash consideration of $134.50 a share, a 22 percent premium to its Friday close of $110.04. Orbital's stock soared nearly 20 percent in the premarket to $131.50.
Equifax — Shares of Equifax slipped nearly 2 percent before the bell, building on already steep losses after it reported a massive data breach on Sept. 7. Monday's move lower comes after the Financial Times reported that short-seller Carson Block was suing the company. In the suit, Block described Equifax's handling of the data breach as "abysmal."
Caterpillar — The Dow Jones industrial average component was upgraded to "buy" from "neutral" by analysts at UBS; it also raised its price target to $140 a share from $116. In a note to clients, UBS analysts said Caterpillar has "more room to run" as it sees "new evidence that a continuation of the earnings upcycle is ahead." UBS also expects Caterpillar to generate nearly $10 billion of cash flow after capital expenses and dividends between 2018 and 2020. Shares of Caterpillar rose 1.6 percent in the premarket.
Brooks Automation — Analysts at Needham lowered their rating on the stock to "hold" from "buy," saying growth in its key semiconductors business is "limited by slow sub-segment, resulting in largely inline performance." Brooks' shares declined 1.6 percent in the premarket.
Roku — Streaming entertainment company Roku expects to price 15.7 million shares of Class A common stock between $12 and $14 a share in its initial public offering, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing.

Copper futures have risen nearly 18 percent this year, a run that Phil Streible, senior market strategist at RJO Futures, deemed "incredible." But after touching its highest level of the year last week, the metal is surely set to cool off, he said Friday in an interview. "If you're currently long copper, you might want to take those positions off and look to reallocate in other safe haven metals, like gold, silver, platinum, palladium. But the copper market, I think, has definitely peaked," Streible said on CNBC's "Trading Nation." In fact, copper just logged two straight weeks of declines; prior to that, the metal often seen as a rough gauge of global economic growth notched eight straight weeks of gains. Investors ought to keep an eye on Chinese economic growth, Streible said. China is one of the world's largest consumers of the industrial metal, and its prices can be vulnerable to economic reports out of the country. Two measures of growth missed this week; Chinese factory output fell below economists' expectations, as did fixed-asset investments. "Chinese economic data showed the lowest reading for industrial production, which dampens the [country's] demand outlook … also while most likely storm related, U.S. industrial production unexpectedly declined today as well," Streible wrote in an email to CNBC on Friday, referring to Federal Reserve data that reflected the first monthly decline since January. Traders' positioning in copper futures may also be signaling a bigger reversal ahead, if recent data published by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission is any indication. "Short dollar, long metals, long gold, and long rates have been persistent trends in 2017, but all suffered a violent reversal at the same time around September 8th. CFTC data reveals that speculator positioning in copper, gold, Euro, and Canadian dollar FX futures was stretched," Pravit Chintawongvanich of Macro Risk Advisors wrote in a note to clients on Thursday. Copper traded slightly lower on Friday.


The price for the digital currency bitcoin is recovering after suffering a massive drop last week.
Bitcoin was trading at $3,964 Monday afternoon, according to CoinDesk, recovering 34 percent from Friday's low of $2,951.15, its lowest since early August.
Bitcoin lost about 14.7 percent last week, extending a sharp drop since briefly topping $5,000 in early September.
The recent fall was triggered by several factors. Some large bitcoin exchanges in China announced plans to close by the end of the month as China cracked down on digital currencies and banned any new initial coin offerings as a way of raising funds.
Bitcoin also took a hit last week after JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon criticized it as a fraud and compared the popularity of virtual currencies to the tulip bulb mania of the 17th century.
The bitcoin market is recovering because investors are getting over the initial shock and realizing that China no longer dominates the market.


As U.K. Prime Minster Theresa May prepares to relaunch her Brexit strategy, global banking bosses meeting nearly 7,000 miles away from London are drawing their own road maps in the event she fails.
"We are all planning for the worst, but hoping for the better," John McFarlane, chairman of Barclays told CNBC at the Singapore Summit.
Deutsche Bank CEO John Cryan agreed from the same event: "The more clarity we have, the earlier the better. That goes without saying. But I think, just on a contingency planning basis, it's right to think the worst."
The C-suite is staying tight lipped on the exact number of jobs slated to leave London.
"The truth of the matter is: We don't know. But it's not a big number," McFarlane said, while estimating around a hundred jobs. "The EU is about 10 percent of our total bank and, therefore, if we were moving all of it, then we would have to move the balance sheet. However, if wholesale activities can remain in London, we don't have to move the balance sheet and therefore, we don't have to move too many people," he explained.
Asked whether it was realistic that half of Deutsche Bank's London headcount was slated to move to Frankfurt, as widely reported, Cryan replied, "No I don't think so.
"Those estimates are difficult to gauge because the scenarios can be different," he added. "We're in a happier position because our capital and our bank are already German. So we can designate the London branch to something but only as a booking center."


With bond yields spending years barely hovering above zero in most developed markets, big money investors are having to get creative to find returns.
For many, that means taking their money to riskier assets. Here's what some of the biggest names in fixed-income investing had to say this week at Milken Institute events in Singapore:


More than three quarters of respondents to this quarter's CNBC Global CFO Council poll say President Donald Trump deserves at least some of the credit for the stock market's record run in 2017, with 17.1 percent saying he deserves "most of the credit."
The CNBC Global CFO Council represents some of the largest public and private companies in the world, collectively managing more than $4 trillion in market capitalization across a wide variety of sectors. The quarterly poll was conducted from Sept.5–13.


In the perennial race between active and passive investment management, there are signs of a shift. After several years of bringing up the rear, active performance has outpaced passive so far in 2017. Various factors suggest that it could stay out front for a few years.
This year has been the best for active fund performance since the bull market began, as it has bested passive more than half the time. About 54 percent of active managers have beaten their benchmarks overall so far in 2017; about 60 percent did so in July.
Meanwhile, though long-depressed inflows into active funds have shown new life recently (they had their best week in 30 months in July, taking in $3.5 billion), money keeps gushing into exchange-traded funds. (Vanguard investors in index funds and ETFs now own nearly 5 percent of the S&P 500.) Real dominance by active management would be marked by a reversal of this tide.
This won't happen, of course, until after active management has shown a sustained performance advantage.
Various considerations suggest the potential for this, including:
Past trends. Historically, active management's comebacks have been multiyear rather than single-year. Though passive has reigned supreme over the past six years, active won the race for six years in the 1990s and from 2001 to 2011. Just as passive management has done best in up markets, active's potential for superior performance tends to be higher in difficult markets. Thus, active did well in the difficult market of the mid-1990s, and passive took the lead during the tech boom late in that decade.

Today's narrow bull market. When the bull's starting point is pegged to the ascent that followed the financial crisis of 2008, the current bull market is now nine years old, the longest since World War II (though the argument could be made that this bull is actually of shorter duration because the market didn't hit a new high until 2013). Regardless, those anticipating a new market cycle are more likely to be gratified with each passing month, as the price/earnings ratio of dominant names have risen to ethereal heights.
This market has a weakness that isn't acknowledged widely enough: It's being driven mainly by six large-cap stocks — Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Google and Johnson & Johnson (the Big Six.) When the market has gone up in the past couple years, much of the gain has been because one or more of these stocks has appreciated. As of early September, year to date, all of the stocks have had robust double-digit gains, with Facebook's shares appreciating nearly 48 percent and Apple's about 37 percent.
If these few bulls stop running and the herd doesn't find new leaders, this result could be an ensuing difficult market — the kind where active managers do best.
Increasing opportunities for contrarian managers. With huge investment from index funds and ETFs, the Big Six have amassed a collective market capitalization of $3.4 trillion — greater than the total value of the bottom 1,115 stocks in the S&P 1,500 — the lower large-cap companies. If the Big Six falter, money pouring into them will presumably find other places to go.
But even if this happens, empowering the bull market to continue, passive management's fixation on the S&P 500 will continue to provide increased opportunities for active managers seeking value opportunities among lower large-cap companies. And some of these 1,115 orphans are fairly attractive.


There's a lot of hurricane damage to come between the Fed and its next interest rate hike.
Hurricane Harvey has already heated up inflation, hit industrial production, and dampened retail sales, and that was just the late August data — before Hurricane Irma rampaged across Florida this month.
Economists expect the storms to shave a half percent or more off third quarter GDP and temporarily boost inflation, including higher gasoline prices and building materials costs. That makes whatever the Fed says about the impact of the two monster hurricanes in the coming week potentially more interesting than its expected announcement on how it will begin unwinding its massive $4.5 trillion balance sheet.
The Fed's meeting Tuesday and Wednesday is the highlight of the week ahead. There are also a few economic reports, including housing starts Tuesday and existing home sales Wednesday. Jobless claims Thursday should again be elevated, with the impact now of Hurricane Irma which caused the evacuation of Florida's coasts and other parts of the Southeast.
Economists expect the economic impact of the hurricanes to be temporary before a rebound as the damaged areas begin to rebuild.
For Fed watchers, the hurricanes have changed the dynamic in a number of ways. One is that the Fed could be more concerned about a weaker economy, particularly if there are further storms.


If investors only paid attention to the aggregate data released by the government, CNBC's Jim Cramer would imagine they'd be huge pessimists about the state of the economy.
"This morning we got retail sales numbers that were baffling. They were for the month of August and they fell by 0.2 percent. That's very subpar. Then the Federal Reserve issued an industrial production number that was clearly wanting. It was a 0.9 percent dip," the "Mad Money" host said. "But I've got to ask you a question: do these numbers really tell you the whole story?"
Instead, Cramer turned to business leaders for a more intimate take on the economy. Brad Jacobs, the CEO of XPO Logistics, told Cramer on Thursday that "industrial economy's back" and on the path to recovery.
Caterpillar, a massive manufacturer, announced earlier this week that the economic cycle was picking up, touting its global orders and climbing stock.
Other executives also said that both the industrial and retail sectors are accelerating, bucking the government's statistics that suggest they're more tepid.
"People remain endlessly skeptical that anything good can happen industrially both here [and] around the world. Yet Brixmor, Eaton, XPO Logistics, Caterpillar and United Technologies – a pretty diverse group – paint a very positive picture of what's really going on here," Cramer said. "So don't be baffled by the national retail sales or industrial production numbers. Be skeptical of them. There's a much better story out there if you just bother to look under the hood."


Investors may have grown hesitant about a merger between CBS Radio and Entercom Communications, but CNBC's Jim Cramer thinks they may have been wrong to worry.
The deal would combine the spun-off CBS Radio with Entercom, creating an entity that could reshape the U.S. radio industry. Entercom's stock surged over 10 percent when news of the deal broke in February, but it has since sold off, shedding almost $6.
"Clearly the market isn't as enthusiastic for this big radio tie-up as we first thought. But what if the market is misreading this CBS Radio deal?" the "Mad Money" host said. "It's a complex transaction. I think the negative sentiment here is giving you a fabulous buying opportunity."
The merger will happen via a Reverse Morris Trust, where one company (in this case, CBS) spins off part of its business in order to merge it with another, smaller company. The tax-free deal will give CBS majority control over the combined company, which will still be called Entercom.
In Cramer's eyes, this will be a monumental deal for Entercom. The new entity will preside over 244 radio stations across 47 U.S. markets.
"They'll be the No. 1 creator of local audio content in America. More important, they'll also have a gigantic sports business, broadcasting games from 45 professional teams [and] numerous college teams" on stations like New York's WFAN and Washington, D.C.'s 106.7, Cramer said.
The "new Entercom" will also become the United States' second-largest radio company by revenue with the best balance sheet in the industry, the "Mad Money" host said.
And while iHeartMedia, the industry's top player, is in danger of going bankrupt, Cramer said that the radio business has more potential to it than many investors might think.
After all, radio's penetration is widespread, with over 240 million weekly listeners. Entercom CEO David Field, who will continue to preside over the combined company, said that "radio reaches more Americans than any other entertainment medium" on the conference call about the merger.
"In short, while online competition's been devastating to television, radio is different because most people listen to radio in the car," Cramer said. "You can't play with your smartphone when you're driving — you need to keep your eyes on the road. All you can do is listen, which is why radio is still relevant."
Entercom's management expects the deal to be immediately additive to earnings and is experienced at integrating new acquisitions, having completed two deals in the last three years.
Entercom is also fairly small, with a $430 million market capitalization. But with CBS Radio's 100-plus stations, Entercom will soon be worth somewhere around $2 billion, a market cap more likely to draw deep-pocketed investors to the stock.
The new Entercom will also create a bustling live events business with some 4,500 live events a year. Cramer said this alone should make the stock a strong play on the rise of the experiential economy, one of his favorite trends.
Wall Street's main concern about the deal was how it was structured. Entercom will have to issue 105 million new shares, which isn't what the existing shareholders necessarily wanted.
"If you simply wanted to own a sedate, small-cap radio station with a nice dividend, well, things have suddenly gotten a lot more complicated," Cramer said. "Basically, Entercom is swapping out much of its shareholder base, and until the deal gets done, many new buyers, I think, are going to hold off on pulling the trigger."
Others worry about Entercom's recent performance, which included a notable earnings miss, but Cramer said he would give the company a pass given its impressive long-term performance.
"I say the negativity is misplaced and Entercom's stock is a bargain," Cramer said. "In fact, it may be one of the cheapest stocks in the entire market. Why? Because pf the complexity of the transaction and the perception that radio's dead. That's scaring people away. As long as there are cars with human drivers — and I know one day there might not be, but right now, there are — there will be radio, and Entercom could be the best way for institutional investors to profit from that longevity."


JPMorgan's top quant strategist backed his boss this week in bashing bitcoin, warning that the cryptocurrency is likely a "pyramid scheme."
Marko Kolanovic, the bank's global head of quantitative and derivatives strategy, said in a note on Wednesday that in addition to being volatile and difficult to value, "another worrying aspect of cryptocurrencies are some parallels to fraudulent pyramid schemes."
Bitcoin needs to be mined, or discovered, by people using computers to solve problems. Its murky origin raises questions, he said. "It is believed that an unknown person (or persons) known as 'Satoshi Nakamoto', before disappearing, mined the first 1-2 million coins or about 10 percent of the coins that will ever exist."
He added, "Mining becomes progressively more difficult, and eventually unprofitable."
Bitcoin surged more than 10 percent on Friday, but was still on track for a big weekly loss during a tumultuous period of trading.
Earlier this week, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon called bitcoin a "fraud," saying that the cryptocurrency "won't end well." Dimon was speaking at the Delivering Alpha conference presented by CNBC and Institutional Investor.
Bitcoin plunged about 13 percent Thursday after one of the biggest exchanges in China said it will shut down its operation. BTC China said in a tweet Thursday that it will close down its operations by Sept. 30 as Chinese authorities crack down on cryptocurrencies.
But to be sure, many see bitcoin as a huge opportunity.
Former JPMorgan strategist Tom Lee said the cryptocurrency could surge another 600 percent in five years. "I unequivocally believe bitcoin is your best investment to the end of the year," the Fundstrat co-founder told CNBC, standing by similar remarks he made Aug. 9 on "Fast Money."
"It's not worth it to look at bitcoin two months, two weeks ahead," Lee argued, saying he still believes each bitcoin will be worth $25,000 in five years.
An unconvinced Kolanovic rattled off a number of risks. "There is no organized power behind this currency to e.g. ensure its long term viability, secure trade, enforce its acceptability for goods and services, or provide investor fraud protection," he said.
"If the use of cryptocurrencies were to increase to an extent that they start competing with traditional 'country' currencies they would be quickly regulated or outlawed."


With recent computer breaches of major companies such as Equifax dominating the news, one Wall Street firm predicts FedEx will suffer from the summer's cyberattack on its European business.
FedEx announced on June 28 its TNT Express subsidiary based in Europe was cyberattacked, which disrupted its operations and communications systems. The company said no data was breached, but the incident could have a material financial impact.
UBS lowered its rating for FedEx shares to neutral from buy, saying the company is facing market share losses in Europe due to the disruptions.
"We expect a combination of additional expense and lost revenue at TNT resulting from the cyber-attack to weigh on results throughout F2018," analyst Thomas Wadewitz wrote in a note to clients Friday.
"In addition, we do not yet have visibility to significant improvement in FDX's Ground margin which could provide an offset to the challenges at TNT."
The analyst cited how TNT had disruptions in their European service operations from June 28 to August 18. He noted the company "lost meaningful volumes in Express / Overnight area in particular" to other shipping competitors, according to his industry contacts.
"The TNT issues could indicate FDX may come in at the lower end of their [cost cutting] target or perhaps even below the low end (our F2020E now reflects about $1.0 bn of improvement)," he wrote.
FedEx did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Its shares traded roughly flat midday Friday after the report.
The delivery company's stock is up 15 percent year to date through Thursday versus the S&P 500's 11.5 percent return.

It's going to take more than a double-digit percentage drop in a week to shake strategist Tom Lee's faith in the potential of bitcoin.
"I unequivocally believe bitcoin is your best investment to the end of the year," the Fundstrat co-founder told CNBC, standing by similar remarks he made Aug. 9 on "Fast Money."
He said on the program Thursday that bitcoin should be viewed as a store of value like gold was in the 1980s when some investors didn't trust dollars.
"It's not worth it to look at bitcoin two months, two weeks ahead," Lee argued, saying he still believes each bitcoin will be worth $25,000 in five years or about 600 percent higher than current levels.
In early trading on Friday, bitcoin fell below the $3,000 level before turning higher in volatile action. But the cryptocurrency was still about 15 percent lower for the entire week by midday.
In the past 12 months, bitcoin has spiked about 500 percent.
But China's recent crackdown on bitcoin exchanges there has created some forced selling, Lee said. But he stressed investors in the digital currency aren't strangers to these kinds of swings.
From mid-June to mid-July, bitcoin fell about 30 percent and then more than doubled to an all-time of over $4,900 at the beginning of September.
To critics, like JPMorgan Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon, who've called bitcoin a fraud, Lee advised investors to be "on the other side, very strong."
On Tuesday, at the CNBC-Institutional Investor Delivering Alpha conference, Dimon called the digital currency a "fraud" and predicted governments will step in. "Wait until someone gets hurt. Wait until it's used for illicit purposes, which it's somewhat used for illicit purposes. They close it down. That's my point," Dimon said.
Lee also said bitcoin can't be in a "bubble," another assertion of bitcoin doubters, because so few people actually own it. "I think it's still very early stages."
"We have some data. There's only about 300,000 holders of at least $5,000 of bitcoin," he said. "That's like saying the iPhone was a bubble in 2007 four days into the sale because there were 500,000 iPhones sold."
Noted economist Mohamed El-Erian on Wednesday told "Squawk Box" that bitcoin is certainly a "disruptive" technology but won't see widespread use. "The current pricing assume massive adoption," Allianz's chief economic advisor and former Pimco chief said. That's the reason why he thinks bitcoin should be worth about half today's value.


Oracle was the worst-performing stock in the S&P 500 on Friday, tumbling more than 6 percent in its worst day in 4 years.
The company reported stronger-than-expected earnings on Thursday for the first quarter of its 2018 fiscal year, which ended on August 31. But the stock turned negative after the company gave guidance for the next quarter.
In terms of guidance, the company expects to bring in 64 cents to 68 cents in earnings per share and 2 to 4 percent revenue growth — with 39 to 42 percent cloud revenue growth — in constant currency for the second quarter of the 2018 fiscal year. Analysts were expecting 68 cents in earnings per share on $9.49 billion in revenue, according to Thomson Reuters. Immediately after Oracle CEO Safra Catz gave the guidance, the company's stock fell more than 5 percent below the closing price of $52.79 per share.
Immediately after Oracle CEO Safra Catz gave the guidance, the company's stock fell more than 5 percent below the closing price of $52.79 per share.
Revenue for the quarter was up 7 percent from last year. New software license revenue continued to decline; it was down 6 percent for the quarter, although it did surpass the FactSet analyst consensus, according to StreetAccount.
Cloud revenue for the quarter was up 51 percent year over year, according to today's earnings statement. Three months ago, Oracle executives said they expected cloud revenue to be up 48 to 52 percent year over year for the first quarter of the 2018 fiscal year. Cloud revenue slightly exceeded FactSet's analyst consensus, StreetAccount said.
Cloud has become so important to Oracle that the company has decided to only give top executives their performance options if Oracle "significantly grows its cloud business," according to a regulatory filing from earlier this month. That significant growth would require $20 billion in total cloud revenue, $10 billion in cloud software revenue, and $10 billion in cloud infrastructure and cloud platform revenue in a fiscal year.
Also, the profit margin for cloud software would have to exceed 80 percent. For this quarter, Oracle's cloud software margin came in at 67 percent when certain items are excluded.
In the cloud infrastructure market, Oracle lags behind Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet. Oracle competes with a range of companies including Microsoft, Salesforce, SAP and Workday in cloud software.
Cloud infrastructure and platform revenue came in at $400 million. For the sake of comparison, Amazon's market-leading cloud infrastructure service produced $4.1 billion in revenue in the second quarter of this year.
Historically Oracle has made most of its money by selling software for on-premises data centers. At this point, the company "appears to be over the hump of its transition" to cloud software, Wedbush analysts Steve Koenig and Joseph Winn noted on Wednesday.
The company had $473 million in capital expenditures, which includes the cost of data center infrastructure to support Oracle cloud services. That figure was up 58 percent year over year.
In June Oracle said Bank of America will use some of its cloud applications.
As it reports earnings, the company is also preparing for its annual OpenWorld conference, which kicks off two and half weeks from now in San Francisco. Oracle board chairman and chief technology officer Larry Ellison said on Thursday's earnings call that the company will unveil service-level agreements that will guarantee cost savings for organizations that switch from Amazon's Redshift database service to Oracle's cloud database.
"There's no one left to buy," Ellison said in response to a question about what to expect from mergers and acquisitions going forward.
Oracle stock is up more than 28 percent since the beginning of the year.

Hurricanes Harvey and Irma may have faded from the sky, but you can count on them coming up again, this time in company conference calls.
All the big hurricanes live again in the quarters following their landfall in the U.S., according to a CNBC analysis of earnings calls transcripts over the past 12 years. Corporate executives blame the storms for lower-than-expected results, express support for those on the ground and cautiously report the pick-up in spending thanks to relief efforts. For the analysis, we focused on companies valued at $5 billion and more.
Generally, the costlier the hurricane, the more it's mentioned in subsequent calls. Hurricane Katrina, which devastated Louisiana in 2005, caused an estimated $133 billion in damages and was mentioned nearly 500 times in the ensuing quarters. Hurricane Sandy, which struck New York City in 2012 and caused major infrastructure damage across the Northeast, caused about $75 billion in damage and was mentioned over 400 times.


Marc "Dr. Doom" Faber said Friday the U.S. is no longer leading the pack and Asian and European stocks have relatively good value.
Faber, the editor and publisher of The Gloom, Boom & Doom Report, said European stocks, with the exception of the FTSE 100, have outperformed the U.S. and most Asian markets this year.
"So, we have had a shift in market leadership away from the U.S. to other markets," he said on CNBC's "Squawk on the Street." "And I think there is better value in Europe and still better value in Asia than in the U.S."
Prior to 2013 and 2014, Faber said he was bullish on U.S. stocks. But after that, he didn't see many opportunities in the United States and turned his eyes to Europe and Asia emerging markets.
Faber said he finds Japanese stocks particularly interesting because its corporate sector has been deleveraging. "Some Japanese companies are actually quite good value," he said.
"I personally prefer investments in Indochina, in Vietnam, Cambodia, Thailand, Myanmar and also Laos," he said. "That is the region I think has enormous economic potential and there will be plenty of opportunities. But for institutional investors, the Japanese market offers in some sectors very good value."
European stocks declinedFriday after North Korea sent another missile over Japan into the Pacific. Still, European stocks hit their best week since July.
In the U.S., stocks rose to record levels Friday.


The big tech rally is starting to lose steam, according to trader Todd Gordon, who says that as a result, it's time to bet against the sector.
"We've been watching the tech sector underperform lately, and I think we're starting to carve out a top," the TradingAnalysis.com founder said Thursday on CNBC's "Trading Nation."
To make his case, Gordon takes a look at a daily chart of the QQQ, the Nasdaq-100 tracking ETF. According to Gordon, the QQQ has been making what he calls an "ending diagonal." In other words, the ETF is making lower highs, and forming a sort of "consolidation wedge" that doesn't show much room to the upside.

In addition, Gordon notes that the QQQ's relative strength index is making lower highs, which suggests that the ETF is losing momentum.
"Basically you're losing a lot of upside price dynamic, meaning there's not a lot of enthusiasm on the upside," the trader explained.
Beneath the surface of the fund, Gordon points out that big tech names like Alphabet, Amazon and Apple are also off their highs. Even Facebook, says Gordon, has "double topped," which he takes as a bearish indicator that the stock will fall.
In order to position for a reversal in the big tech rally, Gordon is buying the Oct. 6 weekly 145-strike puts and selling the Oct. 6 weekly 143-strike puts for a total of 55 cents, or $55 per options spread.
The QQQ opened Friday trading at $145.56. The trade breaks even at $144.45, and if QQQ closes at or below $143 on Oct. 6 expiration, Gordon enjoys his maximum profit of $145. If the ETF closes above $145 on Oct. 6, the entire premium paid will be lost.
In order to reduce the chance of this happening, Gordon plans to exit the trade if QQQ climbs to $146.50, a "double top" level he sees on a 60-minute chart of the ETF.

While QQQ has dropped slightly in the past week, the ETF is still up about 23 percent year to date.


A casual observer may assume Bridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio, who runs the world's largest hedge fund, only had a charmed investing career filled with success after success.
But that isn't the case, as the legendary investor explained in his upcoming book. He actually went broke eight years after he started his investment firm. Counterintuitively, this failure was the best thing that ever happened to him, he said.
In 1982, Dalio confidently predicted the global economy was headed toward a depression and he traded accordingly.
"I was dead wrong … The stock market began a big bull run, and over the next eighteen years the U.S. economy enjoyed the greatest noninflationary growth period in its history," he wrote in his book entitled "Principles: Life and Work," available on Tuesday.
"My experience over this period was like a series of blows to the head with a baseball bat. Being so wrong – and especially so publicly wrong – was incredibly humbling and cost me just about everything I had built at Bridgewater," he added.
Due to the losses, the investor was forced to lay off all of his employees and ask for money from his family.
"I'd lost so much money I couldn't afford to pay the people who worked with me. One by one, I had to let them go," he wrote. "To make ends meet, I even had to borrow $4,000 from my dad until we could sell our second car."
Dalio said he was too arrogant, overconfident and failed to do enough historical research, but the incident led to the self-improvement he needed to become successful:
"In retrospect, my crash [failure] was one of the best things that ever happened to me because it gave me the humility I needed to balance my aggressiveness. I learned a great fear of being wrong that shifted my mind-set from thinking 'I'm right' to asking myself 'How do I know I'm right?' And I saw clearly that the best way to answer this question is by finding other independent thinkers who are on the same mission as me and who see things differently from me. By engaging them in thoughtful disagreement, I'd be able to understand their reasoning and have them stress-test mine."
Failure was the key driver in developing a new perspective Dalio called being "radically open-minded" and helped turn Bridgewater into an idea meritocracy.
"I learned that failing is an essential step toward success, and that the key to success lies in knowing how to both strive for a lot and fail well," he wrote. "By failing well, I mean being able to experience painful failures that provide big learnings without failing badly enough to get knocked out of the game."





With Congress finally making at least halting progress toward tax reform, JPMorgan is advising clients to start preparing for the investing implications.
The firm believes that an initial draft on tax reform will be delivered, as promised, by Sept. 25 even though substantial differences still exist within the "Big Six" legislators working on the plan.
That draft "will help dimension the extent of the reform," Dubravko Lakos-Bujas, JPMorgan's head of U.S. equity strategy, said in a note. Following the draft, a budget resolution proposal is likely to be made public in mid-October.
"This will ultimately indicate the likelihood of a reform happening, how aggressive the proposed tax reform package will be and how it may be funded," Lakos-Bujas said. "Regardless, the proposal will bear a high degree of execution risk as Congress attempts to build broad-based consensus."


One Wall Street firm is getting even more excited about Nvidia, even after the stock's stunning triple-digit performance during the past year.
Evercore ISI raised its price target for the chipmaker to the highest among analyst firms, saying the company's products will dominate the artificial intelligence market.
"We hosted NVDA mgmt. (CEO, CFO and IR) on the road with investors over the last few days. … Our sense is management believes that investors still severely underestimates the impact of AI and the size of the potential market," analyst C.J. Muse wrote in a note to clients Friday. "We are only at the cusp of AI's growth potential and NVIDIA is creating THE AI computing industry standard."
Muse reiterated his outperform rating and raised his price target for Nvidia to $250 from $180, representing 48 percent upside from Thursday's close. He now has the highest price target on the stock out of more than 30 analysts, according to FactSet. Two other firms have the second highest forecast at $200.
Muse noted that the company spent more than $10 billion in research and development to build its CUDA software programming platform, which supports building AI software.
"NVDA has created an industry standard for AI systems that will be nearly impossible to replicate," he wrote.
Nvidia's stock is up 170 percent in the past 12 months through Thursday compared with the S&P 500's 16 percent gain. That performance ranks No. 1 in the entire S&P 500, according to FactSet.
"We believe the tremendous growth opportunities led by AI in the Data Center and Automotive verticals supports a clear path to $10 in earnings power over the next 3-5 years," the analyst wrote.
The company generated earnings per share of $2.57 in fiscal 2017.
Nvidia shares rose 4 percent Friday shortly after the market open.

Check out which companies are making headlines before the bell:
Oracle — The business software giant reported adjusted quarterly profit of 62 cents per share, two cents a share above estimates. Revenue also came in above forecasts. Oracle's results were helped by a successful ramping up of its cloud-based business, however the stock is being pressured by a weaker-than-expected current-quarter forecast.
American Airlines, United Continental, Southwest Airlines – JPMorgan Chase downgraded American and United to "neutral," while upgrading Southwest to "overweight." The two downgrades are based on American and United's prospects given domestic pricing weakness and higher fuel costs, but JPMorgan also said Southwest's valuation is attractive at current levels.
Equifax – Democratic senators have introduced a bill that would stop credit reporting agencies from charging consumers for freezing credit file access, in the wake of the massive Equifax data breach.
Phillips 66 – Phillips 66 chartered a Marshall Islands-flagged ship to help meet fuel shortages resulting from Hurricanes Harvey and Irma. The energy producer took advantage of a temporary waiver of the Jones Act, which ordinarily requires the use of U.S.-flagged ships for transportation between U.S. coasts.
Macy's – Macy's will hire about 80,000 seasonal workers for the holidays, about 3,000 fewer than the retailer hired for the 2016 holiday season.
Alphabet – Alphabet may invest $1 billion in ride-sharing service Lyft, according to The Wall Street Journal. Separately, the Google parent responded to a gender discrimination lawsuit, saying it was reviewing the suit but disagrees with its allegations. The lawsuit had accused the company of discriminating against women in the areas of pay and promotions.
Carnival – The cruise line operator was downgraded to "neutral" from "outperform" at Credit Suisse, citing an uncertain outlook amid increasing threats to demand for cruises.
Henry Schein – The stock was upgraded to "overweight" from "neutral" at Piper Jaffray, which said that it thinks the threat of potential competition from Amazon is overdone. Henry Schein is a major provider of health care products and services to medical, dental, and veterinary offices.
Prologis – Prologis said its Florida properties had suffered no significant damage from Hurricane Irma. The real estate developer's statement follows a similar declaration from home builder Lennar on Thursday.
Genworth Financial – Genworth received approval from Virginia insurance officials to sell its insurance companies based in that state to China Oceanwide Holdings.
First Solar – The solar company's stock was upgraded to "buy" from "hold" at Deutsche Bank, which said its checks indicate that demand for solar modules is rising in the U.S. market and that prices are being driven higher.
Celgene – The drugmaker's stock was rated a "top pick" in new coverage at RBC Capital with a $176 price target, with RBC saying Celgene's growth prospects are being substantially undervalued relative to its peers.
Constellation Brands, Monster Beverage – Both companies are rated "outperform" in new coverage of the beverage industry at Macquarie Research. Macquarie said both companies own what it calls "passion brands" that have a long runway for growth.

CNBC's Jim Cramer is convinced that analysts who weren't thrilled about Apple's new iPhone release are missing something, and it may have something to do with age.
"I think one of the reasons why there was so little 'Wow, got to have it' about the new iPhone, at least among the analyst community, is that the analysts themselves might be too old to get their heads around the way younger people see these products. When new technology comes out, millennials, who tend to be too young to be senior analysts, are far more likely to figure out how to use them and how to adapt to them," the "Mad Money" host said.
Analyst reports from Credit Suisse, Canaccord Genuity, JPMorgan and Piper Jaffray were tepid, saying the product launch met expectations, while KeyBanc analysts were "disappointed" with the iPhone X.
But Cramer argued that younger people are likely to create buzz around new product features, download key apps and use the phones to engage with and document the experiential economy.
"If you're a baby boomer like me, then the best way to figure out what's happening or what's going to happen, especially when it comes to this kind of technology, is to watch what your own kids are doing," Cramer said.
For example, last week, Cramer's eldest daughter introduced him to Pokemon Go, a new mobile iteration of Niantic's hugely popular Pokemon game franchise.
The "Mad Money" host noticed three things when he played the game: first, it was a lot of fun. Second, it used a lot of the iPhone's battery. Third, it had a simple concept, reminding Cramer of games he used to play growing up.
"Playing Pokemon Go, I suddenly could envision a game that could talk to you in high resolution [and] allow you to communicate with others in real time with much more clever augmented realities. Those are not yet available, but these phones are coming closer and closer, and I want to see very much what the iPhone X can do along these lines," he said. "I know my kids will tell me much earlier than I will know myself."
Cramer's other daughter went on a cruise, to his surprise. While he is bullish on the cruise ship industry, he did not expect someone in her 20s to want to go on a cruise.
But the cruise had a millennial draw: It was themed around electronic dance music, or EDM.
"Cruises are fun, I get that," Cramer said. "More important, though, an EDM cruise is a chance to brand yourself via Instagram."
Boasting better cameras and resolution with nearly every model, iPhones help young people capture their experiences, Cramer said. The more photogenic the event, the better the photos, and the better the device, the more incentive millennials have to document their experiences.
"You think any of these post-50-year-old analysts get that?" Cramer said. "They don't see anything new because they don't understand how 20-somethings use technology to brand or even re-brand themselves. They don't understand silly games. They see everything as incremental. Younger people see everything as the ability to explore the seemingly un-explorable or re-create themselves to friends in a setting that's as compelling as a big-screen movie."
That's why some analysts wrote off the new iPhone as another "expected" move by Apple, Cramer said — they didn't realize that higher resolution, better battery life and improved photos would make the $999 special-edition phone worth the cost to younger buyers.
"One device can do hundreds of things that Wall Street analysts would never want to do or know about," Cramer said. "That's why it's 'Blah, blah, blah' instead of 'Wow.' That's why these analysts think the stock should be traded. And that's why they're wrong."


Brick-and-mortar retailers may be feeling the heat from Amazon, but CNBC's Jim Cramer is keen on one chain that's been thriving despite the online giant's domination: Best Buy.
"Five years ago, it looked like this electronics retailer was roadkill, and it was regularly dismissed as merely being a showroom for Amazon. Remember that? You'd go into Best Buy, you'd look at the televisions, computers [or] speakers, then you'd order them off the web for a lot less money. Then Hubert Joly took over as CEO in September of 2012, and ever since then, Best Buy has come roaring back, with the stock nearly quadrupling over five short years," the "Mad Money" host said.
The stock has been so strong that Cramer was surprised when Best Buy shares fell nearly 12 percent after its latest earnings report. Investors fled the stock after management issued some cautious commentary on the conference call, a reaction Cramer saw as overblown.
"Of course, Best Buy has already started bouncing back, but the stock is still down $5 from its highs and it's got a lot of big catalysts coming up in the next few weeks. That's why I think it's not too late to buy the stock of BBY," Cramer said.
Best Buy has gone through a major turnaround under its new CEO, improving the customer experience, expanding its digital presence, cutting costs and boosting the dividend.
But Cramer still felt the need to address the stock's plunge after earnings.
On Best Buy's conference call, management warned that analysts shouldn't get used to the retailer's 5.4 percent same-store sales number it posted in the second quarter.
Then, the company's chief financial officer, Corie Barry, used one of retail's biggest red-flag words, "competitive," or some variation, multiple times to describe gaming hardware sales, new product launches and fourth-quarter performance.
But Cramer said the CFO's commentary spooked analysts more than it should have.
"All that caution — 'competitive,' 'promotional,' 'competitive,' 'promotional,' 'competitive'  — it freaked people out, and investors sold the stock willy-nilly as they were worried that Best Buy was going to get slammed at the end of the year. Honestly, though, I think this was much ado about nothing," Cramer said. "We already knew that electronics, and gaming hardware in particular, was a competitive space. We already knew the holiday season can get really promotional. None of it was revelatory. The truth is, Best Buy's been competing and thriving for years now."
And with Best Buy's stock in the middle of its first major pullback since January 2015, Cramer said that the timing couldn't be better for investors to get into the stock.
Moreover, Best Buy is looking ahead to several catalysts, from its Investor Day on Tuesday to Apple's new iPhone hitting stores later this fall to an impending $2.2 billion share buyback.
"Here's the bottom line: when a high-quality stock gets marked down for the wrong reasons, you need to back up the truck. Make no mistake, Best Buy is high-quality, and while it's already started bouncing, I think BBY could have a lot more room to run," Cramer said.


As the Dow Jones average closed at a record high on Thursday, CNBC's Jim Cramer saw a forgotten sector getting a bit of unexpected love.
"Nothing gives you clues better than the stock market," the "Mad Money" host said. "Remember that peak auto thesis that autos were now headed [down]? Well, that's being disrupted by all those destroyed cars in the Houston area that are insured."
Nearly two weeks after flooding from Hurricane Harvey wreaked havoc on the Eastern coast of Texas, Cramer started seeing some of the most embattled auto stocks breaking out.
"Look at the stock of General Motors. It's finally breaking out. Do you know how many years that thing has been toiling in the House of Pain? That's those insurance checks. They're coming in. Look at the stock of auto parts maker Magna International," he said. "Morgan Stanley had the misfortune of downgrading this one right before the storm. Now it's hitting 52-week highs as the slowdown thesis for the auto industry is kaput and the parts industry is soaring."
But auto isn't the only sector turning around. Cramer also noticed health care stocks starting to come back to the fore and shared his cardinal rule for spotting market rotations.

"This market's rotating into what's been left behind of late. That's healthy. Hey, you know what? It's health care. That's right, health care's catching up. How can you spot these rotations? It's simple. Let me give you my No. 1 rule of thumb for spotting rotations," the "Mad Money" host said. "First, you look up what stocks are rallying the most. You can look at percentage gains or big [basis] point gains. Then you see if there's any news or research behind the particular move that you're seeing. If there's nothing to it, if there's no obvious reason, then you know what you're witnessing? The beginning of a rotation."
Cramer pointed to the stock of Johnson & Johnson. Shares of the medical goods giant had been steady since their last real rally in February, but recently, they've been jumping higher.
"That's perfect. That's the first lead," Cramer said. "Big-time money managers don't want to buy stocks that have run. They want to buy stocks that are about to run."
Now, despite the lack of news fueling Johnson & Johnson's run, Cramer expects analysts covering the stock to step out tomorrow and reiterate their "buy" recommendations.
Analysts covering steady stocks like this one often wait for big moves to voice why they like or dislike their stocks even without clear catalysts, the "Mad Money" host explained.
And it's not just Johnson & Johnson. Cramer noticed the same thing with the stocks of Merck and Pfizer, two other big-name pharmaceuticals.
"But what, you're saying, is worth squawking about if there's really no reason for the J&J move? If you're saying that to yourself, you're a big silly, because something can always be ginned up," Cramer said.
For example, Johnson & Johnson analysts can point to the company's massive overseas sales, particularly in Europe, as cause for the stock's rise. They can cite currency fluctuations in their upgrades, Cramer said.
But the most important thing for investors to understand about rotations is that bulls in bears' clothing are always lurking, searching for areas of value they can recommend despite the news cycle.
"It doesn't take much to get a short-term rotation going, even if many of these moves might not have long-term staying power," Cramer said. "I'm not saying to relax and enjoy the ride, [but] the opposite — that's just complacency. I am staying to observe and understand, and then at least you can make sense of the action."


The Street is buzzing with speculation over what company may be the target for Social Capital Hedosophia, which raised $600 million in an IPO today at the NYSE.
Social Capital is a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), set up to invest in technology companies that are not yet public. SPACs are based on a simple premise: investors are initially going in with a seasoned manager in an investment space (energy, tech, etc.) who will then have up to two years to buy one or more assets. The investors have the option of remaining in the investment or getting out and receiving their money back.
In this case the management team is led by Chamath Palihapitiya, one of the original members of Facebook's management team.
The issue now: what will he buy?
Palihapitiya, in an interview earlier on CNBC, said he was looking for only one company to buy, so there is considerable speculation on what might be in his crosshairs.
He gave us a clue by identifying the rough size of a target: "[T]hink about this as a merger of an entity that should be valued anywhere between $3 and call it $20 billion where that management stays in control..."
That is a wide range, but there are several tech "unicorns" that fall in the $3 billion to $20 billion range. Just in the $10 billion and below range there are several well-known names:


If rates continue to rise, the real estate sector could see pain ahead as rising yields may hit names in the sector often seen as fixed income proxies.
As yields bounce meaningfully from their recent 2017 lows, many noted the decline in utilities stocks, which also sport high yields and thus are seen as a potential replacement for bonds. But real estate investment trusts were just behind in performance, pointed out S&P Global portfolio manager Erin Gibbs.
Indeed, the real estate sector fell modestly this week as the yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury rose. The utilities, consumer staples and real estate sectors are the only sectors in the red over the course of the last week.
If investors continue fleeing bonds, thus pushing rates higher, Gibbs wrote to CNBC in an email, REITs could fall out of favor for two principal reasons.
From an investor demand perspective, REITs offer relatively high dividend yields relative to the rest of the market, and those equity yields could be seen as less attractive as bond yields rise. And from an operations perspective, REITs themselves are often highly leveraged, since they are "borrowing money to finance developments," Gibbs wrote. "As rates increase REITS costs go up, making them less profitable."
When it comes to earnings growth expectations for the next year, the picture is relatively drab for the stocks. Earnings for 2018 have been reduced to "less than half what Wall Street expected in March," Gibbs wrote, with anticipated growth next year coming in a bit under 5 percent.
"Any indication from the Fed next week that a rate [hike] will likely happen in December could push REITs further down. We would be wary of entry point into the sector for the rest of the year," she said, adding that she would expect to see further underperformance from here.
The sector has risen 7.2 percent this year while the S&P 500 has risen 11.5 percent in the same time.

The Federal Trade Commission said Thursday it is investigating the data breach at Equifax that exposed the personal information of 143 million people, and New York's Sen. Chuck Schumer said the company's CEO and board should be be held accountable.
"The FTC typically does not comment on open investigations," FTC spokesman Peter Kaplan said. "However in light of the intense public interest and the potential impact of this matter, I can confirm that FTC staff is investigating the Equifax data breach."
Equifax shares rebounded Thursday morning after plunging more than 8 percent in early trading. They have lost nearly a third of their value since Sept. 7, when the company reported the breach after market hours. The stock was last down slightly in midday trading.
Also Thursday, Senate Minority Leader Schumer called for Equifax executives to agree to testify in the Senate, to contact everyone affected by the breach, extend free credit monitoring and credit freezes to consumers for 10 years and remove mandatory arbitration clauses from its terms of use. If they can't agree to those conditions in the next week, he said, the CEO and the board should step down.
"If Equifax can't commit to them, their leadership is not up to the job and the entire leadership must be replaced," he said.
The credit reporting company said in an updated post on its website that the breach, which it identified internally in late-July and disclosed to the public last week, was the result of criminals exploiting a vulnerability in a website application called Apache Struts. "We continue to work with law enforcement as part of our criminal investigation," the company said.
The hack exposed names, Social Security numbers, birth dates, and other identifying information as well as credit card numbers.
Apache Struts is an open-source code used by companies to develop web applications and is used in Internet of Things devices for financial institutions, government organizations, technology service providers and telecommunications agencies.
A flaw was exposed in it several months ago, and the Apache Software Foundation issued a patch to fix it. On Thursday, the foundation said in a statement: "The Equifax data compromise was due to their failure to install the security updates in a timely manner."
Equifax did not return a call and e-mail for comment.

Continental Resources Chairman and CEO Harold Hamm on Thursday fired back at renowned short-seller Jim Chanos after he revealed he is betting that shares of Hamm's Oklahoma-based drilling company will fall.
"Well, first of all, I can say almost, who is this guy?" Hamm told CNBC's "Squawk on the Street."
Hamm speculated that Chanos — who is known for shorting stocks, or betting that their price will decline — got caught on the wrong side of the trade and is trying to mitigate the damage by talking down shale oil drillers.
Company executives are held to a higher standard of honesty by the Securities and Exchange Commission than short-sellers like Chanos, Hamm claimed.
"For anyone to even put forth the suggestion that we haven't had great expansion and wealth creation in this industry with horizontal drilling and all the technology that's come about the last 10 years, I mean, it's totally ridiculous for anybody to make those types of statements," he said.
Chanos's investment firm, Kynikos Associates, did not return a request for comment.


If there is anyone out there who doesn't need affirmation from Wall Street analysts, it's the 87-year-old investing icon Warren Buffett.
But JPMorgan gave it to the "Oracle of Omaha" anyway Thursday, initiating coverage on Berkshire Hathaway, the conglomerate he's run for five decades, with an overweight rating.
Despite Berkshire being the sixth-largest company in the S&P 500 by market cap, there are just seven analysts covering the company, according to FactSet. This compares to the No. 5 most valuable company in the index, Amazon, which has 41 analyst ratings. Wall Street doesn't really bother to cover Buffett because of Berkshire's low relative trading volumes as Street research often gets paid from trading commissions.
"Berkshire is a collection of best-in-class businesses that range from insurance to railroads, utilities and manufacturing. The businesses benefit from best-in-class managements, unmatched balance sheet strength, and many of the companies have strong brands, scale or low-cost competitive advantages," analyst Sarah DeWitt wrote in a note to clients.
"Berkshire's largest businesses have meaningful structural advantages that we think will allow it to grow earnings and book value faster than overall equity markets over time," she added.
The analyst established a year-end 2018 price target of $210 for Berkshire Hathaway B shares, representing 17 percent upside from Wednesday's close. DeWitt has covered insurance companies for JPMorgan for nearly three years. It's unclear why the bank decided to put her on Berkshire this week.
But we know it's not to curry favor with Buffett, who is already a big fan of the bank and its CEO Jamie Dimon.
DeWitt predicts the company will report 17 percent earnings-per-share growth in 2018 and 9 percent earnings-per-share growth in 2019. She cited how Berkshire has $86 billion in cash, which can be used for future acquisitions.
"Berkshire's balance sheet strength is a significant competitive advantage, and its liquidity position is the highest ever," she wrote. "Our estimates could have upside if Berkshire can deploy record levels of cash for acquisitions."
The analyst also mentioned Berkshire utility executive Greg Abel is currently the "most likely" successor to replace Warren Buffett as CEO of the company.
"We think Greg Abel would be a strong allocator of capital and the earning power of the underlying businesses would remain strong," she wrote.


"Age is just a state of mind" is a laugh line in the geezer comedy "The Expendables" and a wan Hallmark-card slogan. But it also captures the sentiment of an investment scene dominated by talk of the "aging bull market" in stocks.
At 8½ years since the prior bear market ended in March 2009, this advance in equities is now the second oldest on record without at least a 20 percent drop in the S&P 500.
And the appreciation in prices across asset classes has most investors talking about "high valuations" today and "muted returns" in years to come, given the "late-cycle environment." These were themes running through Tuesday's Delivering Alpha conference presented by CNBC and Institutional Investor.
Long-tenured hedge fund manager Leon Cooperman of Omega Advisors called the stock market "fully or fairly" valued, dependent on 4-5 percent earnings growth plus dividends in coming years.
But, he added, "the conditions that normally lead to significant market decline are either not present or not forecastable," including an oncoming recession, a hostile Fed, dangerous inflation, investor exuberance, speculative valuations or a geopolitical shock.
When asked about the Massachusetts Pension Reserves Investment Management fund's 7.5-percent annual return target, its chief investment officer, Michael Trotsky, said:
"I've been very clear when it comes to my constituents, in that for the next five to seven years I don't think our portfolio is likely to return that. It's a bit hypocritical because for the past three and five years, we've returned over that. But I view it as kind of borrowing from the future. We've all talked about equity valuations in particular being fair. You can argue whether they are overpriced or underpriced, but everyone in the room can at least agree they are fairly valued. So it's going to be more difficult."
Credit hedge-fund founder Boaz Weinstein of Saba Capital, added: "The reward isn't there" in high-yield bonds — an asset class that often leads equity markets and is now widely owned by retail investors craving scarce income.
So, there's broad agreement that markets have been generous for a pretty long time and the trees are stripped of the low-hanging fruit.
Still, saying the bull market is getting on in years and might be slowing down doesn't mean it must end soon or is through having fun. Today's 70-year-olds have achieved the biblical life span, and when they were born in 1947, life expectancy for Americans was under 70 years. Yet a 70-year-old right now can expect to live 15 more years.
And for as old as this bull is, it has proceeded at a fairly measured pace. The S&P 500's annualized total return since the depressed March 9, 2009, launch point has been 17.5 percent — quite healthy but not particularly excessive by the historical standards of bull-market gains.
What's more, the current trailing 10-year annual return for the index — which stretches back to just before the 2007 precrisis peak — is only 7.6 percent. At previous major bull market peaks, this 10-year annual pace has routinely been above 15 percent.
An exception to this was the 2007 peak, when it was roughly the same as the current level. And it wouldn't take much upside from here to make that 10-year record look pretty good. If the S&P were to climb just another 10 percent in the next 18 months, the 10-year trailing return will exceed 15 percent by the time we hit the 10th anniversary of the 2009 bottom.
Everyone knows this math, and all investment professionals can see that stocks look rather rich by most fundamental measures, which is restraining their enthusiasm and making many reluctant buyers.
This week, Goldman Sachs strategist David Kostin felt moved to answer clients' constant calls for a market correction with the case for why one was unlikely (sturdy consumer trends and investors' own caution). The monthly Bank of America Merrill Lynch global fund manager survey showed above-average fund cash levels and the highest incidence of downside hedging in 14 months.
There aren't many conspicuous distortions or worrisome stresses in the capital markets at the moment. All asset classes appear similarly stretched in valuation — yet rationally valued in relation to one another.
This is a world of 1 percent Fed-determined short-term rates, 2 percent 10-year Treasury yields, a 2 percent S&P 500 dividend yield, 3 percent corporate bond yields, 4.5 percent "free cash flow" yield on stocks and 5.5 percent junk-bond yields. Not exciting, hard to get excited about, perhaps insufficiently compensating for risk. But nothing says it must end soon, or what will come along to disturb that arrangement of asset-class orbits.
Ed Clissold, chief U.S. strategist for Ned Davis Research, believes the "mid-cycle earnings recovery" we've seen this year presents a risk heading into 2018. Past cycles suggest these profit revivals peter out after about a year and stocks can struggle once earnings-growth rates peak.
Doug Ramsey, CIO of Leuthold Group, has been bullish since the early-2016 correction abated but remains wary of the market's staying power. "We believe this bull market still has legs … but so might the mini-correction that's hit mainly the secondary stocks so far," he wrote to clients last week, before the S&P 500 blipped to a slight new all-time high in recent days.
He grants that market uptrends don't expire based on the calendar, but suggests investors also are not entitled to generational advances of the '80s-'90s type.
"It's commonplace for stock market bulls to observe that cyclical 'bull markets don't die of old age.' Maybe not," Ramsey said. "But if age doesn't matter, will they also acknowledge that 'not all secular bulls last 18-20 years?' Very doubtful."
It's a debate we might be having for some time to come, as long as this bull keeps aging gracefully.

Wells Fargo is warning investors that the year's record market gains could soon start slipping away.
It's a situation prompting the firm to get "more aggressive" in its latest strategy to take risk off the table.
"We are not bullish on the stock market," Christopher Harvey, the firm's head of equity strategy, said Wednesday on CNBC's "Trading Nation." "We think that investors should start moving up the quality ladder."
According to Harvey, this year won't end the way it began with stocks ripping to new highs.
He expects the S&P 500 to drop about 1 percent this year from current levels. His year-end price target is 2,475.
"Hold on to your gains. You want to start protecting," he added. "We think the best of the stock market is behind us not in front of us."
Harvey predicts the stock market will further deteriorate into 2018. He doesn't see much that could catapult stocks to another banner year of double-digit gains.
"The problem is rates are lower, credit spreads are tighter and growth has been strong. What's the next act? And, we don't see the next act," cautioned Harvey. "As we look forward, we're thinking and looking at mid-single digit returns. And, if we go a lot higher from here, I think we're just stealing from tomorrow."
Despite his bearish view, he isn't avoiding stocks altogether. Harvey's goal is to play more for rotation and small, incremental gains.
"We think there are opportunities on an individual basis," he said. "We like staples over consumer discretionary. We like REITs over utilities. We like hardware over semiconductors."
Yet, there is something that could push Harvey back into bullish territory— one that has nothing to do with pro-business legislation such as tax cuts potentially coming out of Washington.
"What we want to see is a healthy repricing for risk. Something in or around 5 percent seems about right. We're not arguing that the fundamentals are bad," Harvey said. "What we're arguing is price isn't all that attractive for us. So, if we get a correction or we get a pullback on price, that would make us more excited."

Check out which companies are making headlines before the bell:
Lattice Semiconductor — President Donald Trump blocked the proposed acquisition of the chip maker by a China-backed private-equity fund. The fund had planned to buy Lattice for $1.3 billion.
Tenet Healthcare – Tenet has hired advisers to explore strategic options, including a potential sale, according to reports by The Wall Street Journal and Reuters. Sources say discussions are in early stages and there is no guarantee that the talks will result in a deal for the hospital operator.

However, the company said about 120 new orders and delivers during the recently completed third quarter were impacted and about 700 delays will be seen in the current quarter.
Expedia – Expedia struck an alliance with British travel company Thomas Cook. Under terms of the deal, Expedia becomes Thomas Cook's preferred hotel provider for certain holiday sales.
Western Digital – Western Digital was accused by Toshiba of "persistently overstating" its rights regarding Toshiba's planned sale of its memory chip unit. Western Digital, which is Toshiba's partner in a Japan-based chip plant, is part of a group seeking to buy the unit, although Toshiba is now leaning towards another group involving Bain Capital, Apple, and others.

This has been a remarkably easy time to be a bull.
September is set to be the 11th straight month in which the S&P 500 has either risen, or has fallen by less than 0.1 percent. If stocks continue to act well in the second half of the month, that will make this the longest such streak for stocks in 58 years.
Going back to 1928, the S&P has only seen four prior streaks in which the index avoided posting a monthly drop of more than 0.1 percent in 11 or more straight months, according to a CNBC analysis of FactSet data. The most recent run was the longest ever, stretching from March 1958 to May 1959, before being broken with a 0.4 percent June decline.
Prior streaks went from 1953 to 1954, from 1949 to 1950, and from 1935 to 1936.
In a sense, the recent streak is emblematic of a markedly restrained level of stock market volatility. While it hasn't seen a monthly loss of more than 0.04 percent, the S&P 500 hasn't seen a monthly gain of more than 3.7 percent in the past year, either. Contrast that to the 1958 to 1959 period, when the S&P rose more than 4 percent in three separate months.
Interestingly, 1959 is notable to stock market historians as the year in which bond yields surprised many by breaking decisively above stock dividend yields. Richard Sylla, the Henry Kaufman professor of the history of financial institutions and markets at NYU's Stern School of Business, has pinned that shift on increasing public trust of corporate reporting, which spurred greater optimism about equities.
When asked about the recent streak, Boris Schlossberg of BK Asset Management commented Wednesday on CNBC's "Trading Nation" that "it's definitely historically interesting" — but added that he certainly wouldn't make any investment decisions based on it.
"The stock market trades on forward guidance, and every day is independent of the day beforehand, so we really can't make any kind of investment conclusions from the fact that we've had very strong uptrends so far," Schlossberg said.


Professional investors are at their most pessimistic since before the election of President Donald Trump, despite a bull market that continues to roll along.
The Investors Intelligence survey, which gauges the sentiment of investing newsletter authors, showed bullishness at 47.1 percent, a decline of 2.4 percentage points from last week. That's the lowest level since just before Trump's win back in November and comes as bearishness has risen to 20.2 percent, which is a high since the election.
As recently as July the bulls were above 60 percent, with a 2017 peak of 63.1 in late February. Bearishness had been in a range between 16.5 percent and 18.3 percent for most of the year, but has moved out of that area.
The results come amid growing concern on Wall Street.
Hedge fund legend Julian Robertson called stocks a "bubble" during an appearance Tuesday at the Delivering Alpha conference presented by CNBC and Institutional Investor.
The switch in sentiment also comes as the S&P 500 has risen nearly 11.5 percent and has even managed to eke out a gain in September, historically the market's worst month. Stocks have pushed higher this year amid a backdrop of stronger corporate earnings, decent if still unspectacular economic fundamentals — and sentiment that Trump's policies would be market-friendly.


Now that Amazon officially owns Whole Foods Market, one top Wall Street firm predicts the internet giant expanding into the physical grocery store market will boost its other businesses.
Morgan Stanley reiterated its overweight rating for Amazon shares, saying millions of Whole Foods shoppers will likely sign up for Amazon Prime.
Amazon's "price cuts, Prime Now and other investment will pressure profitability, but we also see Whole Foods Market driving faster Prime sub growth," analyst Brian Nowak wrote in a note to clients Thursday.
Nowak reaffirmed his $1,150 price target for Amazon, representing 15 percent upside from Wednesday's close.
The analyst estimated 38 percent of Whole Foods customers, or about 5 million households, are not Amazon Prime subscribers.
"We expect Amazon to convert half of these shoppers between now and the end of 2019," he wrote. "We see AMZN's Prime member growth and engagement, Echo device sales, and consumer web traffic/interest driving solid top line trends and GMV [gross merchandise volume] per customer growth."
Nowak also predicts Whole Foods sales will grow by 12 percent annually through 2022. It will reach 3.3 percent market share of the US grocery market during the next five years from an estimated 2.1 percent at year end 2017, according to the analyst.
"Growth will come from new shopper growth, which we see inflecting from more competitive pricing and increased convenience," Nowak said.
Amazon is crushing the market so far this year. Its shares have risen 33 percent year to date through Wednesday versus the S&P 500's 12 percent return.


Retail stocks are slowly coming back after weeks in the doghouse, and CNBC's Jim Cramer wondered if one high-profile deal contributed to the bounce.
"Now that it looks like Nordstrom could soon be taken private by the Nordstrom family aided by the leveraged buyout guys at Leonard Green, will there be a re-valuation of all retailers in the stock market?" the "Mad Money" host asked.
But perhaps some retail stocks were already climbing. Two months ago, shares of Dollar Tree were $66. The stock has since climbed to $84, making Cramer question why Wall Street was so worried about Dollar Tree in the first place.
Or consider TJX Companies, one of Cramer's favorite retailers. The close-out merchandise seller's stock is still stuck in the low $70s after a good quarter with strong full-year guidance.
Cramer said TJX's new home furnishing initiative, HomeSense, paints a promising picture for the discount retailer's future.
"Given that it's opening another 100 HomeGoods stores, the company clearly expects no cannibalization. And it's not just a me-too Bed Bath & Beyond with cheaper stuff, either. It's better, with a quirky, general-store throwback feel," the "Mad Money" host said.
Target's stock has also been on the climb, helped by the retailer's announcement that it would hire 100,000 workers ahead of holiday season, up 40 percent from 2016.
"I wonder — I mean, honestly — could things be worse than last year or better?" Cramer said. "That's why this stock's extending its recent rally."
Cramer has also been pounding the table on Kohl's, a department store chain he considers to be an alternative strip mall play with true customer loyalty.
The "Mad Money" host liked Kohl's even before it partnered with Amazon to bring a "smarthome experience" to 10 of its stores, a win for the retailer in an environment largely stifled by Amazon.
"How could you not like a company with a monster buyback, huge customer retention, inexpensive prices, a newfound love of brands like Nike and Under Armour, as well as, well, let's just throw it in, a 6 percent yield?" Cramer said.
So as more and more retail stocks begin to claw their way back upward, Cramer's watching closely to see who makes it out on top.
"The most important takeaway is you've got to recognize what Leonard Green, very smart guys, recognized: retail's not going away, it's just going to different places," he said. "Those stores that can handle one less trip to the mall each month will make it. They will. They'll stay in business and they will see their stocks increase in value. Perhaps not as far as you'd like, but in many cases, certainly further than they've already gone. I can't believe that I like this group."


With Wall Street abuzz about Apple's new product launch, which included a new, high-end iPhone model, CNBC's Jim Cramer wanted to clear the air for those wondering if they should trade or invest in the tech giant's stock.
"Investing and trading require two very different mindsets. When you invest, you're going in for the long haul," the "Mad Money" host said, reflecting on his 21 years as both an investor and a trader. "You don't want to buy all at once. Instead, you buy gradually, in stages on the way down."
Trading is totally different. It's event-driven, meaning traders search for a catalyst in order to sell a given stock. Whether or not the catalyst works out in their favor, they end up selling the stock.
The second cardinal rule of trading is to not reach for a trade. Cramer called the traders who bought Apple in the days leading up to the launch "clowns" because they wrongly assumed one of three things would happen to the then-$162 stock.
First, they assumed that the iPhone X would be so great that it would shock people into buying the stock. Second, they assumed those people would buy them out of their positions. Third, they may have had no idea what they were doing.
"Any of those buyers are almost certain to be shaken out now, and that's the worst thing you can do as a trader," Cramer said. "You're at the mercy of everyone else in the market. Many of these people are now thinking, 'I'm an idiot, but you know what, I'll just own Apple for the long haul.'"
But that's the wrong strategy for a trader, because if Apple's stock declines, that trader will inevitably lose money, Cramer said. Traders should focus on not being shaken out instead.


The stunning stock rally for AMD shares in the past year is just the beginning of a bigger run, according to one Wall Street analyst.
Jefferies is bullish that the chip maker will be able to gain market share from Intel in the cloud computing server chip market.
"We hosted AMD CEO Lisa Su and SVP Ruth Cotter for investor meetings early this week. Management expressed confidence in its server MPU [micro processor unit], EPYC, its ability to reach its target gross margin model (40-44%), and its new desktop MPU products, Ryzen," semiconductor analyst Mark Lipacis wrote in a note to clients Wednesday.
AMD's stock is up nearly 115 percent in the past 12 months through midday Wednesday compared with the S&P 500's 17 percent gain. That performance ranks No. 3 in the entire S&P 500, according to FactSet.
Lipacis reiterated his buy rating for AMD stock and his $19 price target, representing 54.5 percent upside from Tuesday's close.
The analyst cited how Microsoft, Baidu and Tencent announced their intentions to use AMD's latest server chips in their cloud computing data centers. He predicts AMD's share of the server processor market will rise to 2 percent by year-end 2017 and 8 percent by year-end 2018 from nearly 0 percent today.
"We believe those share estimates could prove conservative. AMD's share goal in servers is double-digits," he wrote.
AMD management also said the digital currency mining market for its graphics cards will likely be more resilient than in previous cycles.
"Management did not comment on our attempt to quantify AMD's cryptocurrency sales last quarter, but was sympathetic our notion that the cryptocurrency risk is lower than 2014 due to the emergence of a commercial cryptocurrency mining market which appears more stable (and to which it sells crypto-specific GPUs directly)," he wrote.


President Donald Trump on Wednesday claimed rich Americans "will not be gaining at all" from the tax reform plan that Republicans hope to pass this year.
"I think the wealthy will be pretty much where they are. ... If they have to go higher, they'll go higher, frankly," the president said during an afternoon meeting with bipartisan members of Congress amid a recent string of outreach to Democrats.
GOP congressional leaders are working to draft tax legislation and aim to introduce it in the coming weeks. Overhauling the American tax system was a key goal of the Republican government when Trump won the White House and the GOP held both chambers of Congress last year.





Nordstrom shares opened 5 percent higher Wednesday after CNBC reported a Nordstrom family group was closing in on a deal with a private equity firm to help take the department store private.
Nordstrom family members were close to choosing Leonard Green & Partners to help fund a buyout of the eponymous department store, people familiar with the matter said Tuesday.Leonard Green would provide Nordstrom family members with roughly $1 billion in equity to help fund the deal, the sources said.
The family group, which owns 31.2 percent of the 116-year-old retailer, said in June it was looking to take Nordstrom private. It has since been looking for a private equity partner to help support the deal and also held talks with KKR and Apollo.
A deal between Nordstrom and Leonard Green has not been finalized, and other parties could make a move to disrupt the talks. It's also still possible talks could fall apart. The family group is already talking to banks about raising $7 billion to $8 billion in debt to finance the deal and is hoping to submit a formal bid in the next couple of weeks, the sources said. Nordstrom has appointed an independent special committee to evaluate the offer.
Nordstrom has a market capitalization of roughly $7.7 billion.Leonard Green has worked with Nordstrom before. The Los Angeles-based private equity firm has a stake in the British fast-fashion line Topshop, which has a partnership with the Seattle-based department store.
KKR and Apollo declined to comment. Nordstrom and Leonard Green didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.
The Nordstrom family is hoping that as a private company, Nordstrom will be able to make investments that help it adapt to the changing retail landscape without worrying about short-term shareholder reaction.
On Monday, Nordstrom announced it will roll out stores without merchandise, similar to concepts offered by e-retailers such as Bonobos and Warby Parker. Its stock slid as much as 5.4 percent to $43.59 on the news.Other long-term initiatives for Nordstrom include investing in e-commerce, closing underperforming stores and investing in top locations, and expanding its successful discount shopping chain, Nordstrom Rack, according to a source familiar with the situation.
Still, a leveraged buyout of a department store is challenging in 2017. Several private equity backed-retailers have buckled under the weight of large debt loads that have hampered their ability to invest in e-commerce and adapt to the rapidly changing retail industry. Private equity-backed Payless ShoeSource and Gymboree filed for bankruptcy earlier this year, while Neiman Marcus is currently working with restructuring advisors.
Still, with the Nordstrom family likely to maintain control over the department store's operations, the potential deal to go private follows a different template than many of its peers. Nordstrom has long been viewed as the jewel of the department store industry, with an affordable high-end price point that puts it between midtier Macy's and exclusive Neiman Marcus.
The company was quick to spot shoppers shifting to off-price retailers like TJ Maxx and Marshall's and put its efforts behind Nordstrom Rack, its own take on the category. Its investment into e-commerce helped it buck the industry trend last quarter of same-store sales declines.
Still, like all of its peers, it has seen its stock fall this year as investors question whether department stores can compete as shopping habits change.
Analysts were quick to point out that Nordstrom's unique track record and significant family ownership are likely to keep any potential deal to go private the exception rather than the rule.
"The structural challenges for the traditional department stores are abundantly clear today," wrote Gordon Haskett analyst Chuck Grom. "We don't foresee anything similar transpiring at Macy's, Kohls, and/or JCPenney, particularly since family ownership is virtually nonexistent.
Nordstrom operates 356 stores, including 121 full-line stores in the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico. Of those, 221 are Nordstrom Rack stores. Its Seattle flagship location, modeled after famous European department stores, has restaurants, bars and pop-up shops. Nordstrom is also working on a flagship location at 217 West 57th St., near Manhattan's Central Park.


One Wall Street analyst went against his bullish peers and was less than impressed with Apple's latest iPhone unveil.
The $999 price tag of Apple's iPhone X represents a "substantial increase that seems justifiable only for relatively rich people who care deeply about the appearance of their phone," wrote KeyBanc analyst Andy Hargreaves in a note Tuesday.
He noted that the smartphone is the most expensive mobile from Apple to date, about $300 more than the price of a new iPhone 8.
Hargreaves differs sharply with his analyst peers, who largely gushed over the more swanky model. Drexel Hamilton's Brian White wrote that "Apple took the iPhone franchise to a whole new level with the iPhone X," praising the company for its venture into the "ultra-luxury" smartphone market.
But the KeyBanc analyst has an even bigger reason for being cautious on Apple shares than whether or not targeting wealthier customers is a good idea.
"The lack of compelling features in the iPhone X also raises longer-term concerns about Apple's pricing power," he wrote. "The iPhone X suggests compelling new features may be difficult to come by going forward, which could imply a period of elongating average holding periods and falling ASPs after a peak in FY18."
But to be sure, Apple retains fierce brand loyalty as well as a strong hold on consumers through "network effects, content lock-up, and learned experience with iOS," Hargreaves acknowledged, an environment consumers would be hard-pressed to leave.
Apple shares were up nearly 40 percent this year into the release. However, the stock finished Tuesday down 0.4 percent following the announcement and fell another 1.5 percent in midmorning trading Wednesday as investors appeared to side more with Hargreaves than the majority of his peers.

Shares of Dolby Laboratories popped on Wednesday after Apple revealed several new products featuring Dolby technology.
New Apple products, including the iPhone X and the new Apple TV 4K, will support video technology called Dolby Vision, Apple said on Tuesday at a big launch event in Cupertino, California. Apple said Dolby's technology will help the set-top box output the "highest resolution possible" and that it would make mobile content look "even more amazing." Dolby demonstrated the effect on its website.
Investors lapped up Apple's praise: Shares of Dolby's stock were up more than 9.5 percent on Wednesday, after rising 4.74 percent in Tuesday after-hours trading. More than 3.8 million Class A shares of Dolby changed hands on Wednesday, way above the 30-day average volume of about 439,000.
Analysts at Piper Jaffray called Apple's shout-outs "significant wins" for Dolby.
"The stock reacted favorably on the news and rightfully so," JPMorgan's Paul Coster wrote in a research note. "Apple's adoption of Vision on mobile may entice other [manufacturers] to follow suit."

The positive feelings driving strength in the stock market and the economy could disappear if any of the geopolitical trouble spots were to heat up, Starwood Capital's Barry Sternlicht said Wednesday.
He also cited the wranglings in Washington over tax reform as another layer of unpredictability.
"It feels like the ocean is full of money. But it feels like it could be yanked at any moment," the global investor and real estate specialist said on CNBC's "Squawk Box," citing North Korea or Syria as wildcards.
Whether President Donald Trump and GOP leaders on Capitol Hill can deliver on tax reform this year is also adding to uncertainty, said Sternlicht, co-founder, chairman and CEO of Starwood Capital, which has $55 billion in assets under management. And that uncertainty is manifesting itself in lower property transaction volumes as sellers wait to see if they might get to keep more of their capital gains a few months from now, he said.
Sternlicht said he's even put off projects within his own business for a quarter or so.
The White House and Republican House and Senate leaders are aiming to simplify and cut taxes on Americans and businesses by the end of the year.
"I think they will get something done. I just not don't think they'll get it done this year," Sternlicht said.
In a tweet Wednesday, Trump prodded lawmakers to "move fast" on taxes.

Sternlicht said he supports tax cut efforts but "you can't do tax reform in a tweet."
Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin on Tuesday made the case for tax changes, telling the CNBC-Institutional Investor Delivering Alpha conference that the administration is considering backdating tax reform to the beginning of 2017. Sternlicht said he was pleasantly "shocked" by the prospect of backdated tax cuts.
But the passage of tax reform depends on balancing the expected benefits to the economy and how to pay for it, he said.


Like it or not, the U.S. stock market has performed exceptionally well since President Donald Trump was elected.
The S&P 500 has added $2.04 trillion in market value since Trump's election last November through Monday, according to Howard Silverblatt, senior Index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices. The benchmark rose to a record on Monday and then another in early trading Tuesday.

The index initially soared after the election, in part, on hopes of tax reform from the new controversial new president. The U.S. has one of the highest corporate tax rates in the world and a reduction of that would bulk up companies' bottom lines.
One of the biggest beneficiaries from tax reform would be the information technology sector, the stalwart of the U.S. stock market since Nov. 8.

JPMorgan believes investors should brace for volatility.
Anastasia Amoroso, global market strategist for JPMorgan Private Bank, sees it particularly affecting the bond market.
"I would consider positioning for a pickup in volatility in the fixed income markets or maybe even a pickup in rates. If we start to price in any progress on the tax-reform front, then we may have to price in an incrementally more hawkish Fed," Amoroso said Tuesday on CNBC's "Futures Now." "Volatility in the fixed income markets has been very benign headed into this [Fed] meeting."
Volatility has been trading at historic lows. The CBOE volatility index sank to its lowest level ever on July 26. It has now traded under 10 on 56 occasions, including 38 this year.
"The market is focused on tax reform, but the market is not currently pricing in tax reform. We see that in rates," she said.
And, if rates go up, bonds generally sell-off.
Amoroso doubts the Fed will raise rates a third time this year when it meets next week. She speculates the Fed is taking a wait-and-see approach when it comes to whether the White House can successfully get a tax package through Congress.
"The window for tax reform is pretty limited because it's really between now and the end of December," Amoroso said. "As we get further into next year we start thinking about midterms," she added, referring the the 2018 elections. "You have to deliver sooner rather than later."


A weakening U.S. dollar is having a peculiar impact on stocks this year, specifically when it comes to the behavior of value and growth stocks, according to Tom Lee, founder and head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors.
Since the mid-1990s, investors could practically "set their watch" to consistent relationships between value stocks, growth stocks and U.S. dollar strength, Lee wrote in a note to clients.
This relationship makes sense, as a weaker dollar is thought to benefit U.S. companies that export their goods or do business abroad (since each unit of foreign currency taken in will translate into more dollars). In addition, the dollar tends to rise when the U.S. economy is strengthening, and faster growth is more important for the economically sensitive value stocks.
But this year, he said, the relationship has all but unraveled.
When it came to buying value stocks in prior years, "it worked in almost every downturn in the dollar — and every time the dollar was strong, you wanted to be long growth. This year, we've had almost an 11 percent decline in the dollar, and growth stocks are massively outperforming value," Lee said Monday on CNBC's "Trading Nation."
So far this year, the greenback's value has tumbled more than 10 percent versus a basket of major currencies, and yet value stocks are underperforming. The S&P 500 value index is up 4.0 percent this year, while the S&P 500 growth index is up a whopping 17.5 percent.
This divergence between the dollar and the traditional growth-value relationship is likely to abate, Lee said; for that reason, he thinks that value stocks are a good pick now.
Specifically, Lee favors the value-heavy financials and energy sectors.
More broadly, the dollar's weakness has come amid an unusual macroeconomic backdrop for many different reasons. The dollar has slid in 2017 even as long-term interest rates and oil have both fallen as well, making this a "strange year" in Lee's view.


Bitcoin fell below $4,000 on Wednesday with negative comments from a major business leader about the cryptocurrency and the threat of a regulatory crackdown, unnerving investors.
The digital currency dropped as low as $3,766.36 on Wednesday and traded down 8.7 percent at $3,792.43 as of 11:03 a.m. in New York, according to data from industry website CoinDesk.
The move lower came a day after JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon called the cryptocurrency a "fraud," adding that "Someone is going to get killed."
"It's worse than tulip bulbs. It won't end well. Someone is going to get killed," Dimon said at a banking industry conference organized by Barclays. "Currencies have legal support. It will blow up."


The most anticipated consumer technology product event in years lived up to the hype, at least according to Wall Street.
Analysts are gushing with optimism over the potential upgrade cycle from Apple's new high-end $999 iPhone X and iPhone 8 models that were unveiled Tuesday. "Apple took the iPhone franchise to a whole new level with the iPhone X, pushing the company deep into the ultra-luxury smartphone market with the highest priced iPhone in the company's history," Drexel Hamilton's Brian White wrote in a note to clients Wednesday. "We walked away even more encouraged by this new iPhone cycle, Apple's future in AR [augmented reality] and the company's ability to distance itself from its competitors."Apple share prices were down 1 percent in early trading Wednesday, perhaps because much of the enthusiasm was already priced into the stock. The shares have rallied 39 percent year to date through Tuesday versus the S&P 500's 11.5 percent return.


CNBC's Jim Cramer sees far too many investors ignoring a simple formula that has kept him level-headed during his years on Wall Street.
"Newsflash: stocks, by and large, do get cheaper when they go lower. Call me captain obvious for pointing it out, but I think this commonsense wisdom often gets ignored when we're analyzing stocks on a day-to-day basis," the "Mad Money" host said.
Cramer was reminded of the phrase on Tuesday, when Apple launched an array of new products, including a special-edition iPhone X for the 10th anniversary of the first iPhone release.
He was amazed that he kept hearing people asking each other if they would upgrade and being receptive to the new model instead of balking at the $999 price tag.
"I haven't heard anyone say, 'Nah, I just bought the [iPhone] 7.' I'm either hearing, 'Yes, I'll upgrade,' or 'I hope someone will buy it for me,'" Cramer said. "That's incredible. That's what I call consumer product amore. It's the most beloved device I can remember."
But it wasn't that long ago when Apple shares took a nosedive from $131 in May 2015 to $92 in May 2016, and CEO Tim Cook came on "Mad Money" to clear the air about the stock market's premature assumptions about what turned out to be a successful product transition.
"In short, this was a stock that got cheaper as it went down, and if you bought it in the $90s after Cook spoke to us, well, you made a ton of money," Cramer said.
Other examples of this theory abound. The stock of United Technologies is down to $109 from $120 as of Tuesday's close because the defense contractor will acquire Rockwell Collins, an airplane component maker.
While the $23 billion price of the cash-and-stock deal is higher than Wall Street would like, Cramer compared it to when United Technologies bought Goodrich six years ago for $18 billion. Back then, the stock shed about 10 basis points in response. This time, it also shed about 10 points.
"Is it wrong to ask if history could be repeating itself?" Cramer wondered. "Here's my theory about United Technologies: as its stock has come down, wouldn't you know it? It's gotten cheaper. You might think that's so self-evident it's not even worth mentioning, but because of the decline, investors are running away from the stock, not towards it, as if United Technologies has somehow gotten more expensive. It hasn't, and I think we'll look back on this as a great buying opportunity."
Unfortunately, not every stock is beholden to this commonality. The stock of Macy's failed to price in the massive decline in retail from when it cost $60 a share through its decline. At $22 a share, Cramer thinks Macy's shares have finally baked in the weakness.
"Here's the bottom line, though: don't sneer at every stock that goes lower. Sometimes there's more pain ahead as stocks get even cheaper because of fear or ignorance, but remember the winners," Cramer said. "I think when you do, you'll look back and recall 'buy low, sell high.' Great investment strategy. Who would've thunk it?"

Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is eager to complete tax reform this year, and while CNBC's Jim Cramer fully understands its benefits, he's not convinced it will happen.
"Look, I say this as a huge believer in both tax reform and President [Donald] Trump's economic team," the "Mad Money" host said.
Lower corporate taxes would push companies to repatriate their assets back to the United States, which they have been resisting because of high, noncompetitive U.S. tax rates. Domestic companies could then use that money to hire more people and expand business, thus growing the U.S. economy.
"However, as much as I love tax reform, I'm a realist," Cramer said. "Earlier this year, at the time of the inauguration, I could not have been more excited about the president's economic agenda. But not anymore. I know better now."
Mnuchin acknowledged at CNBC and the Institutional Investor's Delivering Alpha conference on Tuesday that Congress got sidetracked on health care reform.
Congress' disagreement over the border-adjustment tax, which would place a value-added tax on imported goods in order to fund the tax cuts, also stymied tax reform talks.
"Then this morning the Treasury secretary said he wants to change the taxation of pass-throughs, a type of business that could benefit from tax reform. The administration also wants to eliminate deductions for state and local income tax in order to pay for the plan," Cramer said. "Ugh. Here we go again."
Don't get Cramer wrong; he wants tax reform completed. But keeping it simple is the best way to get it done, and that's not what the "Mad Money" host sees congressional Republicans doing.
"Any kind of comprehensive reform, whether we're talking health care or immigration or taxes, always takes forever, always ends up being unpopular [and] usually ends up failing," he said. "But if you want something done, just do it. Give the middle class a tax cut. Give companies a tax holiday on the repatriation of overseas assets, and then watch the economy bloom."
Cramer suggested policymakers do the same thing with infrastructure and offer U.S. citizens savings bonds to fund repairs of crumbling roads, bridges and tunnels.
"We'll buy them. We'll do it because we're patriotic and we're practical," he said.
But if Congress is going to let lawmakers and interest groups and all the powers that be complicate what should be simple policy measures, Cramer said they should just forget about it.
"There was a time when I used to ask each executive who came on the show what they would do with the money they'll get from a lower corporate tax rate," Cramer said. "I don't even bother doing that any more. You know why? Because I don't want to waste your time. You've got other things to do. Doing it this way, going about it the way the White House is doing it right now, pretty much insures failure. The best is the enemy of the good. Memo to the GOP: stop trying to make tax reform perfect. Just get something passed. Let's get this done."


DoubleLine CEO Jeffrey Gundlach believes that the U.S. dollar has finally hit a bottom — at least for now.
The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, hit a more than 2-year low of 91.011 on Friday as investors worried about the short-term impact of Hurricane Irma and North Korean tensions on the U.S. economy.
"The dollar for the short term has bottomed," remarked Gundlach, saying the coming bounce could cause the dollar index to "grind" higher to the 96 or 97 level.
"But I don't think it's going to endure," he added, predicting the greenback "ultimately takes another leg down."
Gundlach's comments came during his Tuesday webcast for investors in one of his mutual funds, the Double Line Total Return Bond Fund.
As one of the few investors on Wall Street to accurately predict Donald Trump's election victory in 2016, Gundlach noted that the dollar originally rocketed upward following the election but has since fallen sharply off those highs.
Reiterating some of his previous concerns surrounding the market, he noted that now is not the time to be accruing risk.
"I think this a very poor time to be taking a lot of risk in bond funds," he said, specifically urging investors away from junk debt.
Gundlach also noted a drop in commercial and industrial loan growth as an area of concern for U.S. markets.
In the past, the Federal Reserve had already started to "ease interest rate conditions with this drop in loan growth of this magnitude ... But this time the Fed wants to raise rates," Gundlach said.
He noted that the success of equity market appears to be tied to a worldwide policy of quantitative easing by major central banks, making him anxious for future balance sheet rollbacks and the market next year.


The activist fund Marcato Capital, fresh off a proxy battle with Buffalo Wild Wings, has taken a stake in a construction equipment maker it says is  poised to grow after strategic re-positioning.
Mick McGuire of Marcato Capital talked about the stake at the Delivering Alpha conference in New York on Tuesday. Marcato began buying last year and has roughly 1.1 million shares of Terex Corp., according to its recent regulatory filing. It owns 6 percent of the company, McGuire said.
Shares of Terex rose 4 percent Tuesday, but were down 0.57 percent in after-market trading.
McGuire says the company's revenue should increase if expectations for economic growth come to fruition.
The activist fund recently came off a bitter proxy contest at restaurant group Buffalo Wild Wings, where it won three board seats and led to the resignation of CEO Sally Smith.
The conference is presented by CNBC and Institutional Investor.





Saba Capital's Boaz Weinstein said the high yield debt market is overvalued and as a result he is betting against the bonds of retailers and hospitals. "Let's unpack high yield … the reward isn't there" given the risk, Weinstein said at the Delivering Alpha Conference in New York on Tuesday, noting that smaller retail investors own more junk bonds than they ever have before.
Weinstein cited what happened during the energy industry's credit crisis in 2016. He noted the prices of some energy companies' bonds and equities both fell nearly 90 percent.
"There was no safety being in a debt instrument," he said.
While the hedge fund manager is short the debt of retailers and hospital firms, he is long the shares of the same companies due to relative valuation.
"Equity is at a much more rational price versus the credit," he said.
Weinstein is the founder and chief investment officer of Saba Capital Management, a $1.7 billion credit hedge fund based in New York City. Weinstein founded Saba in 2009 with a team that came from the Deutsche Bank proprietary credit trading group, which he started in 1998.
His comments came from the Delivering Alpha conference in New York, which is being presented by CNBC and Institutional Investor.



Starboard Value Jeffrey Smith pitched store-brand pharmaceutical company Perrigo as his best investment idea now, during a conference Tuesday.
In addition to Perrigo, Smith also advocated for Altaba, the former Yahoo, which he said will benefit from tax reform once it makes its way through Congress.
Perrigo makes versions of ibuprofen, liquid cold medicines and other products that fly under the name of retailers including CVS. The stock has fallen in recent years, but Smith said it presents strong value for investors.
"It's a beautiful business, and store-brand as a whole is actually a much larger business than any one brand," Smith said during the Delivering Alpha conference presented by CNBC and Institutional Investor in New York Tuesday.
Shares jumped more than 4 percent in morning trade.
Smith said that Perrigo also does not face the same online challenge from Amazon as many other retailers.
"While Amazon poses a real threat to many consumer companies, we actually believe it represents a very large opportunity for Perrigo, who is the store brand manufacturer," he said.
Smith is the CEO at Starboard Value. He is an activist investor and has been able to influence a number of companies by getting board members appointed. This year he placed five members on the board of Perrigo in addition to two new ones who came on late in 2016.
Earlier this year, he stressed the need for tax reform, particularly in allowing companies to bring back profits stored overseas at lower rates.
Smith said Altaba would be well-positioned to benefit once Congress agrees on a tax plan. In addition to repatriation, Republicans and the Trump administration are pushing for lower corporate and personal taxes.
This version clarifies an earlier accounting of the new board members at Perrigo.





Giving President Donald Trump credit for the strength of the U.S. stock market is a "stretch," hedge fund manager Jim Chanos said Tuesday.
Global equities are experiencing a "synchronized bull market," fueled by years of the easy money policies of world central banks, Chanos said on CNBC's "Fast Money Halftime Report."
"There's the general view that what's worked will continue to work," he argued. "To put it either pro or con on the basis of President Trump's policies is, at this point, a stretch."
To make his case, Chanos asked: Is Trump responsible for rallies in markets such as Mexico, too? Chanos has been critical of Trump in the past.
The bull market has been creating great opportunities for betting against companies, or shorting stocks, but the overall up-trend has made it tough, said Chanos.
"It's easier of course" to find short ideas, he said. "They just don't work."
Chanos' Kynikos Associates is one of the world's largest short sellers.
Short selling is a practice in which traders can bet against a company by selling shares they don't own and buying them back at a lower price.
Chanos said he's "passively" long the stock overall market and "short" individual companies, including Tesla, which he called a "cult stock."
He gained recognition for raising red flags with a prescient negative call on once high-flying Enron before the energy firm blew up in scandal.


Hedge fund king Ray Dalio said Tuesday it would be "terrible" if Gary Cohn would leave the White House, a move that could upset markets.
Speculation about Cohn's future has been rampant since he apparently has fallen out of favor with President Donald Trump. Cohn, the former chief operating officer at Goldman Sachs, is Trump's top economic advisor but recently criticized the president for his reaction to the racial violence in Charlottesville, Virginia.
Thought only a short time ago to be in line for the chair position at the Federal Reserve, there's increasing speculation that Cohn may be leaving the administration soon.
"In terms of my reaction, I would say if he was to leave it would be terrible," Dalio said at the "Delivering Alpha" conference presented by CNBC and Institutional Investor.
"It would also represent a challenge for the administration," he added. "It also becomes representative to what it would be like to be in the administration. It would be difficult to get quality [people] in the administration. ... I think it would be terrible if Gary left."
Cohn is currently helping usher Trump's tax reform plan through Congress. Earlier in the day, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he and Cohn continue to work together with the hopes that a tax package can get done by the end of the year.
However, various reports indicate that Trump has frozen out Cohn. The New York Times on Monday reported that Trump does not make eye contact with Cohn when they are in a room together, a favorite tactic of the president to show displeasure.
The rift comes at what Dalio said is a critical time for the country. He compared the current economy to the situation in 1937, just as the U.S. was about to enter the second leg of the Great Depression.
The rise in populism is a common thread, Dalio said. While he had expressed hope for Trump, Dalio lately has been more critical.
Dalio has a book soon to be released called "Principles: Life & Work," which will lay out hundreds of ideas on which he has lived his life and operated in business. Dalio runs the largest hedge fund in the world, famous for the management philosophy of "radical transparency."
Dalio said Cohn is skilled in what the hedge fund titan called "thoughtful disagreements," which he said forms the cornerstone for the way his Bridgewater Associates is run.
"The power of great collective decision-making is so much greater than the power of any individual decision-making," he said.





A slew of chip stocks is likely headed for gains after Apple's product launch Tuesday, JPMorgan predicts.
With many investors expecting significant developments in the next generation of iPhone, JPMorgan listed some of the companies likely to see shares jump, including Apple's rising chip technology partner, Broadcom.
"As we have discussed in prior research, we expect Broadcom to benefit from increased dollar content in the forthcoming iPhone models, including the new OLED version that we expect to use Broadcom's touch control technology," wrote JPMorgan analyst Harlan Sur.
"In total, Broadcom has pointed to a 40% increase in blended content in the new iPhone models, and we believe the company's non-RF content [wireless charging, touch controller, Wi-Fi/Bluetooth, GPS] is increasing by $3-$4 per iPhone versus last year's models."
The relationship between Apple and Broadcom has been hot lately, generating much attention from Wall Street analysts in the run-up to what is expected to be a major upgrade for the iPhone. Sur previously noted that the wireless charging partnership between Apple and Broadcom — "a key enabler of Apple's best-in-class performance"— has been going on for about two years.
Apple's new product presentation is set to start around 1 p.m. ET.
"We believe Broadcom is a leader in wireless communications, enterprise storage, networking, and broadband with broad-based exposure to positive trends," wrote Sur, reiterating his overweight rating.
While Broadcom may make headlines, JPMorgan also highlighted antenna and radio frequency provider Qorvo. The company's mobile segment supplies radio solutions that provide a wide variety of functions in the cellular radio space for major phone manufacturers and could stand to reap big gains if Apple's product launch is a success.
Qorvo is already up a whopping 38 percent since January. Seth Klarman, the value investing giant who draws comparisons to Warren Buffett, purchased a large stake earlier this year. Klarman's hedge fund, Baupost, acquired 7.2 million shares of Qorvo worth $493 million, according to the March quarter 13F filing.
Strong iPhone demand would benefit memory players like Micron Technology as well, which supplies phones with types of random access memory (RAM).
"Micron and other industry participants should benefit from increased DRAM demand (unit demand and potential increases in content per phone) from Apple in 2H17 and into 2018," Sur said. "We anticipate Micron benefitting from the new iPhone launches and remind investors that the iPhone 7+ contained 3GB of DRAM vs. 2G of DRAM for the iPhone 7 and prior iPhone versions."


Billionaire hedge fund manager Leon Cooperman recommended First Data, Shire, United Continental Holdings, Hess and WPX Energy at the Delivering Alpha conference on Tuesday.
On First Data: "The stock is very cheap," he said.On Shire: "Investors have overly discounted concerns and ignored positive data."On United Continental: "The airline's management has identified a lot of cost opportunities. I expect 15 percent earnings growth the next few years."
On Hess and WPX Energy: "The solution for low oil prices is low oil prices. Energy stocks seem overly discounted. These two picks have growing production profile and a net asset value well above current prices at existing oil prices."
At the conference, presented by CNBC and Institutional Investor, Cooperman also shared his view on the market and oil prices over the next year.  "The market is in a zone of fair and full valuation. I see very few signs of exuberance," he said. "I predict oil will be higher in an year. I see the price of oil going to $60."
Cooperman founded Omega Advisors in 1991. The firm has approximately $3.6 billion in assets under management, according to its website.


Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Tuesday said the stock market has surged on expectations President Donald Trump's administration and Congress will pass tax reform.
The S&P 500 has rallied more than 16 percent since the Nov. 8 election through Monday, adding more than $2 trillion in market value to the benchmark, according to S&P.
"There is no question that the stock market has expectations that we're going to get tax reform done," he said at the Delivering Alpha conference presented by CNBC and Institutional Investor. "The stock market has expectations we're going to create significant growth."
Mnuchin also said the Trump administration is considering backdating tax reform to the start of this year to boost the U.S. economy further.

The easy money has been made off retail's meltdown, and now it's time to see where the sector is going, billionaire Marc Lasry told CNBC on Tuesday.
"We've covered quite a bit," the chairman and CEO of Avenue Capital said ahead of the 2017 Delivering Alpha Conference presented by CNBC and Institutional Investor magazine.
"Right now, whatever we've made money [on] we've made money on. I think the issue today is where is retail going. We'll all find out in a year," he added in an interview on CNBC's "Squawk Box" ahead of the conference. "The easy money has been made, and now you're sort of going to wait. It's a melting ice cube. And the question is how fast is it melting?"
Earlier this year, Lasry told CNBC he went short on retail. He said the issues facing retailers were "just too big" and those stocks would likely see more downside.
The SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT), a popular exchange-traded fund that tracks the performance of retail stocks in the S&P 500, was up 1.74 percent over the last 30 days but was more than 8 percent lower for the year, according to FactSet.
Lasry said Tuesday his firm is now looking for potential longs but added he's not seeking a stock like Amazon.
"I'm looking at companies today where their debt has gotten hit and their equities have gotten hit, and we'll probably start investing in that sector again in the next three to six months as we get a better feel for what's happening," he said.
"It's more high end. ... Like a J.Crew or a couple others," he added.
— In addition to Lasry, Delivering Alpha participants include Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, Omega Advisors Chairman Leon Cooperman, Bridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio, Blackstone chief Steve Schwarzman, DowDupont CEO Edward Breen, Kynikos Associates' Jim Chanos and JPMorgan Chase chief Jamie Dimon.


In a year that has seen digital currency prices go higher not by percentages but multiples, investors are starting to worry that things have gone a bit too far.
Bitcoin is now considered the "most crowded trade," as measured by sentiment in the monthly global Bank of America Merrill Lynch Fund Managers survey. That means investors believe there are too many people on one side of the trade and it could be due for a reversal.
Bitcoin's price has surged about 330 percent this year, the beneficiary of a jump in interest for the cryptocurrency and a growing field of competitors, as well as a flight to alternative assets and, some fear, a speculative bubble.
The Merrill survey is one of the most followed and respected on Wall Street. Conducted during the week that ended Thursday, more than 200 global fund managers with at least $600 billion under management were surveyed.
Of course, a crowded trade doesn't have to mean it's nearing an end.


A daily morning look at the financial stories you need to know to start the day.
STOCKS/ECONOMY
-Stock futures are higher after Monday's strong rally.  Gold continues to edge lower and is now at the $1,327 an ounce level.
-The national debt is now above $20 trillion.
NEW APPLE PHONE
-Apple is expected to unveil the new iPhone X today.



Check out which companies are making headlines before the bell:
DowDupont – The newly combined company has altered its spinoff plan, now planning to move units with $8 billion or more in annual revenue from the materials spinoff to the specialty chemicals spinoff.
Travelers — The insurance company temporarily suspended stock buybacks while it evaluates its losses stemming from hurricanes Harvey and Irma.
Apple – Apple holds its long-anticipated product launch event today beginning at 1 p.m. ET, at which new versions of the iPhone are widely expected to be unveiled.
21st Century Fox – Fox has joined the court challenge against a CBS deal to buy Australian TV broadcaster Ten Network Holdings. A private company controlled by Fox Executive Chairman Lachlan Murdoch has challenged the CBS deal in court and wants to revise its own bid.
Western Digital – The hard disk drive maker may or may not have a deal to buy Toshiba's chip unit, in a long-running takeover process. Published reports in Japan say Toshiba has agreed to sell the unit to a group led by Western Digital for $18.3 billion, but Toshiba has denied the report and said it is continuing to evaluate bids.
Equifax – The credit reporting agency is seeing lawsuits pile up related to the massive data breach that may affect as many as 143 million Americans. More than 30 lawsuits have been filed in the U.S. so far, with Equifax shares falling more than 20 percent since the breach was disclosed last Thursday.
Teva Pharmaceutical – The drugmaker has agreed to sell its Paragard contraceptive brand to a unit of Cooper Companies for $1.1 billion in cash.
Nielsen – Nielsen had to delay issuing its ratings for Sunday night's victory by the Dallas Cowboys over the New York Giants, because the company had to evacuate its ratings staff in Tampa Bay ahead of Hurricane Irma.

First Data – First Data filed for an 85 million share secondary offering, on behalf of shareholder New Omaha Holdings. The payment processing company will not receive any proceeds from the offering.


It's rare that CNBC's Jim Cramer comes across stock market sentiment as optimistic as Monday's, where investors see the glass half full but consider it to be brimming.
"In the last 72 hours, we have seen a whole slew of events that might normally give investors pause or make them think, reflect. Instead, this time, these events just gave buyers an opportunity to get in while the getting's still good. At most other moments in history, buyers would be wary of the current setup. Now, though, they're enthusiastically embracing the future," the "Mad Money" host said.
The most unusual thing about these events is that the rally around them is predicated on a lack of negatives rather than on the presence of positives, Cramer said.

The most unusual thing about these events is that the rally around them is predicated on a lack of negatives rather than on the presence of positives, Cramer said.
Besides Cramer's five reasons for the rally, the FANG stocks also surged. And out of the stocks in his acronym for Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google (now Alphabet), one stood out amid the weather-focused news cycle.
"Netflix always does well when people are shut in. It's as much of a storm play as Amazon, which gets new Prime members when local stores are closed for inclement weather," Cramer said.


As the proxy fight between activist investor Nelson Peltz and Procter & Gamble continues, P&G President and CEO David Taylor offered a rebuttal to some of Peltz's suggestions on CNBC.
"He's proposed some things that could be very dangerous to the short term, which is reorganize the company right now, and he's proposed something very dangerous for the long-term future of this company, and that is eliminating our corporate R&D," Taylor told "Mad Money" host Jim Cramer on Monday, referring to his consumer product company's research and development.
Peltz's firm, Trian Partners, released a long-awaited proposal last Wednesday detailing changes it would like to see at P&G, including a board shake-up and splitting the business into three smaller segments.
Taylor said the suggestion to remove the company's corporate R&D, which would turn into three separate R&D departments within Peltz's structure, would deprive P&G of lucrative opportunities.
"I can give you several examples: the sachets that are often used for samples in the U.S. and they're sold by the hundreds of millions in developing markets — the process to make them faster than anybody can make them commercially, and at a lower cost, was developed using our liquids understanding from our liquids businesses and our converting capability that comes out of our paper businesses," Taylor said. "If you had separate businesses with separate R&D, you wouldn't have made that connection and would have missed the opportunity to take advantage of a real plus."
The CEO also said that he and Peltz had spoken many times about the activist's ideas, despite the fact that, according to Taylor, the data Peltz used was dated.
He said that Peltz was coordinating with a former P&G executive who left the company eight years ago and had lost touch with the organizational changes being made.
"I've listened to his ideas because I believe it's important to listen to investors," Taylor said of Peltz. "But in the first several meetings, he didn't advance new ideas, and the few new ideas he did advance weren't right for our company right now. We've already made many of the changes he advocates. A more focused company, we're there. A company that has people empowered and accountable, we're there today and we're executing. The last thing we need right now is a reorganization."
Taylor added that he was surprised by Peltz's activism and the proxy fight as a whole, particularly because of the changes P&G has allegedly implemented.
"We didn't ask for the proxy fight, but I'm absolutely committed, as is our board of directors and the people of P&G, to do what's right for the short, mid and long term for the company. And for that reason, we're fighting it," he said.
While Taylor acknowledged the several-year period in which P&G's business stalled and even lost share in some countries, he said the company responded with an overhaul that worked.
"We didn't accept that we can't improve. We made the changes to our portfolio. We made the changes in our organization. We're leaner today than we were five years ago and especially 10 years ago. And we made the changes in our culture to be able to set ourselves up with a much more focused, empowered and accountable organization," he said, echoing some of the changes Peltz called for in his 93-page proposal.
And when it came to considering Peltz, a 50-year veteran of the consumer goods space who says he doesn't know how to spell "lose," for P&G's board, Taylor was not interested.
"We want the absolute best for our company, whether it's a member of the board of directors or whether it's our senior management. The standard is the best. And we've done our homework and he's not the right person for P&G right now," the CEO said. "Many people tell me, 'Why not?' 'Why not' is not the governance standard for our company. We want 'Why?' Who are the right people to bring to the company that would add value for the future?"


The Chinese National Congress is set to meet in mid-October, and some predict the session will have wide-reaching implications for global markets and the economy.
Discussions around the growth of the country's debt in recent years will be particularly consequential, said Chad Morganlander, portfolio manager at Washington Crossing Advisors.
"One critical thing to watch is how they rebalance their economy. Over the course of the last five years, you've actually seen nonfinancial debt in China increase by roughly $14 trillion, which is pretty close to 90 to 100 percent growth. That growth rate is not sustainable," Morganlander said Monday on CNBC's "Trading Nation."
This apparent mountain of debt has created "financial fragility" across China, he said, and the country's Communist party would like to "decelerate" that growth rate.
"Unfortunately, that rebalancing does have major implications on U.S. markets and foreign markets," he said, given the massive amount of goods consumed and produced in the country and the many international markets it touches.
On Monday, China began scaling back measures that support the Chinese yuan following its rally this year against the U.S. dollar and other rival currencies.
The country's accrued debt has been discussed by closely followed hedge-fund manager Kyle Bass.
Bass, founder and chief investment officer at Hayman Capital Management, has expressed a bearish view of China and has been vocal about the country's mounting debt.
"They're doing things to try to tweak their trade relationship with the U.S., but more importantly, their newfound strength globally, both economically and as you see militarily in the South China Sea, is all based on their belief in their economic strength," Bass said in June on CNBC's "Squawk Box."
He added: "All that is built upon a massive credit expansion that they're going to have to come up" against.
Furthermore, the relationship between the U.S. and China has become increasingly fraught as the Trump administration earlier this year placed a sanction against a Chinese firm and two Chinese citizens with ties to North Korea, he said.


Check out the companies making headlines after the bell:
Shares of American Eagle Outfitters fell nearly 3 percent. The retailer declared a quarterly dividend 12.5 cents a share, the same amount it has declared since May of 2013, according to a review of press releases on the company's website.
Kroger's stock dipped slightly after multiple analysts lowered price projections for the grocer. BMO Capital cut the stock's target price to $20 per share from $24 per share. Jefferies snipped its expectations on the stock to $19 per share from $24 per share. JPMorgan dropped its estimate on the stock to $21 per share from $24 per share. Kroger reported earnings for its second quarter last week.
Equifax shares declined. The credit rating agency announced last week it suffered a data breach earlier in the summer. Three executives sold shares shortly after the company became aware of the incident but before it told the public. On Monday, the U.S. Senate Finance Committee sent a letter to Equifax CEO Richard Smith seeking additional information about who knew what and when.


Puerto Rico was in an economic crisis before it was slammed by Maria as a Category 4 storm. The island, which remains almost entirely without electricity, is already in the midst of an 11-year recession. It filed for the largest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history back in May.
Related: Puerto Rico: 11 years in recession and now no electricity
Estimates from Chuck Watson, an analyst with the disaster research group Enki Research, were slightly more conservative.
Watson expects that Puerto Rico will face $30 billion in total damages -- $20 billion in physical damages (both insured and uninsured) and $10 billion in lost economic productivity.
But even that level of damage would take a massive toll on Puerto Rico's $103 billion economy, since it represents roughly 30% of the territory's GDP.
The longer Puerto Rico is without power, the worse the situation will be, Watson said.
"If it takes six months to get the grid back online, you're getting more economic impact than physical impact," Watson said.
His current model assumes that it will take three months for 90% of Puerto Rico to have electricity restored.
Related: Hurricanes Irma and Harvey have racked up billions in damages. Who pays?
Watson said he's also concerned that people will decide to flee Puerto Rico permanently.
"A lot of people have family here on the mainland," he said. "It's almost like [Hurricane] Katrina in New Orleans, where a lot of people left and didn't come back. It really guts your economy, because a lot of people who leave are your middle class and your professionals."
The dire situation comes as Florida, Georgia and Texas continue to recover from Hurricanes Harvey and Irma.
AIR Worldwide put insured losses for Hurricane Irma between $32 billion and $50 billion in both the U.S. and the Caribbean. The firm predicted that insured losses will exceed $10 billion for Hurricane Harvey.
Moody's Analytics said it anticipates that total damage from the two storms will exceed $150 billion.
But economists expect the U.S. areas affected by Harvey and Irma will recover much faster. Texas has the nation's second largest economy, and economic output reached $1.7 trillion at the end of 2016. Florida, the country's fourth largest economy, had a 2016 GDP of $947 billion.


EDGAR contains information about company earnings, share dealings by top executives and corporate activity, such as mergers and acquisitions. Accessing that information before it's disclosed publicly could allow hackers to make money by anticipating how a share price would respond.
Related: Why the SEC hack is a really big deal
It's still unclear what information hackers obtained or which companies might have been affected.
The breadth of the inspector general's review will include the scope of nonpublic information that may have been compromised, as well as the SEC's response to the matter, according to the chairman's testimony. Clayton, who took over the agency in May, said he's also asked investigators to provide recommendations on how to fix and control any deficiencies.
"We must remain on top of evolving threats when it comes to securing our own networks and systems against intrusion," said Clayton.
The IG's review will be in addition to the agency's own inquiry into the 2016 breach.
Clayton first revealed news of the breach on September 20 in a lengthy statement released by the agency. He said he waited to disclose the episode to Congress and the public until he "knew enough" to understand the details of the 2016 intrusion.
Notice of the cyberattack comes on the heels of another major security breach at Equifax (EFX), which affected 143 million individuals -- nearly half of all Americans.
According to Clayton's testimony, the 2016 breach of EDGAR was first discovered as part of a separate ongoing enforcement investigation by the markets regulator.
Related: U.S. regulator says hackers stole market-sensitive data about companies
Once learned, Clayton said, "I immediately commenced an internal review."
The chairman said the agency believes hackers were able to get into the system via a "defect [in] custom software" of the EDGAR system. Steps were taken to fix the broken software, and a department within Homeland Security was notified, he said.
The agency's initial review shows that "intrusion did not result in unauthorized access to personally identifiable information, jeopardize the operations of the commission or result in system risk," said Clayton.
Still, he said the agency's review and investigation is still ongoing and would take "substantial time to complete."
The SEC is still looking into the intrusion itself and whether there are other vulnerabilities in EDGAR's system, as well as illicit trading that may have occurred as a result of the breach.


"D.C. is literally a tale of two different cities," JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said on Monday from a conference in Manhattan.
Dimon hopes the Washington D.C. investment will "lift up" residents in these underserved neighborhoods. He said the $10 million "may be the beginning of a much bigger thing."
JPMorgan (JPM) wants to encourage "inclusive growth" by deploying capital towards affordable housing, jobs-skills training and loans to minority-owned small businesses.
"We've done a terrible job -- we being collectively the leadership of America -- in trying to make sure all of our citizens don't fall behind," Dimon said from Fortune and Time's CEO Initiative. He urged business leaders and government to do more to address inequality by improving education, job training and relocation services.
JPMorgan's focus on Washington D.C. comes three years after the bank made a huge bet on Detroit by agreeing to pump $100 million into the bankrupt city over five years. JPMorgan claimed early success and eventually upped the investment to $150 million.
"If we can help in Detroit, we can help anywhere," Dimon said.

Washington D.C. is an obvious candidate for assistance from JPMorgan, which hauled in a record $24 billion in profits last year. While tony neighborhoods like Georgetown are booming, homelessness is a real problem in other sections.
The District has one of the highest poverty rates in the country, with 17.3% of its residents over the past three years living in poverty, according to government statistics.
That's despite the fact that Washington D.C.'s economy grew significantly faster than the overall economy last year. And its per capita income of $75,596 is more than 50% higher than the national average.
"There is this incredible income disparity," Peter Scher, JPMorgan's head of corporate responsibility, told CNNMoney.
Wards 7 and 8 are at the heart of Washington D.C.'s inequality issues. JPMorgan noted that these neighborhoods face high poverty and unemployment rates, limited affordable housing and the loss of businesses.
Washington D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser called JPMorgan's commitment to the city a "welcome addition" to grassroots efforts already in the works.
"We know that while D.C.'s economy is thriving, not enough residents are benefiting from our city's prosperity," Bowser said in a statement that included support from business and community leaders.
JPMorgan is devoting $5 million to try to address gentrification concerns raised by the development of the 11th Street Bridge Park, a project that will link some of the area's poorest neighborhoods with more affluent ones. Some fear this development will jack up rents, pushing out less affluent residents.
"The potential for lower and middle income people to be displaced by this is real," said Scher.
Related: JPMorgan gives $1 million to fight hate groups
Of course, JPMorgan also has a business reason for pumping money into the nation's capital. Scher acknowledges that the Washington D.C. metro area is a "growing presence for us" and one of the biggest economic regions in the U.S.
Dimon applauded collaboration between local nonprofits in Washington D.C. and Bowser. He contrasted that with the "train wreck" being caused by "mismanagement" of other cities and states he declined to name.
"Some governments, they are corrupt...They're stuck in the mud, so don't help them," Dimon told CEOs in the audience.


The issue came to a head after President Donald Trump said that NFL owners should fire anyone who protests the anthem. He said anyone who does protest is a "son of a bitch."
After more NFL players joined the protest on Sunday, Trump tweeted that he was "so proud of NASCAR" because it did not "put up with disrespecting our Country or our Flag - they said it loud and clear!"
So proud of NASCAR and its supporters and fans. They won't put up with disrespecting our Country or our Flag - they said it loud and clear!
On Monday, NASCAR released a statement in which it said it respects the national anthem and that it's "always been a hallmark of our pre-race events."
It also acknowledged the right to free speech and peaceful protest.
"Thanks to the sacrifices of many, we live in a country of unparalleled freedoms and countless liberties, including the right to peacefully express one's opinion," the statement said.
It noted that "sports are a unifying influence in our society, bringing people of differing backgrounds and beliefs together."
Related: NFL: No fines for teams that skipped national anthem
NASCAR's statement comes after several racing team owners warned drivers and crew members against taking a knee.
Team owner Richard Childress said that if any of his employees protested he would tell them "get you a ride on a Greyhound bus when the national anthem is over."
He said he told them "anyone who works for me should respect the country we live in. So many people gave their lives for it. This is America."
Team owner Richard Petty said he'd fire employees who decided to protest.
"Anybody that don't stand up for that ought to be out of the country. Period," Petty told USA Today. "If they don't appreciate where they're at ... what got them where they're at? The United States."
Richard Petty Motorsports said it did not have an official comment.
Compared with other sports leagues, NASCAR has less racial diversity among fans and drivers. However, driver Dale Earnhardt Jr. tweeted a message of support for peaceful protests on Monday.
He tweeted a quote attributed to President John F. Kennedy about how all Americans have the right to peacefully protest and that anyone who makes "peaceful revolution impossible" will "make violent revolution inevitable."

On Monday, Villanueva's No. 78 jersey was outselling big names like Marshawn Lynch and Aaron Rodgers on the NFL Shop. Fanatics, which manages the site, said it was the top seller across all of its sports platforms.
His jersey may have surged in popularity, but Villanueva said during a press conference that his decision to walk out of the tunnel had caused a lot of embarrassment. He said he made his teammates, coaches and the team's owners look bad.
He said head coach Mike Tomlin told the players to come to a unified decision about what they would do during the anthem. Tomlin wanted unity in the response and when the team couldn't come to a decision, they resolved to stay in the locker room.
Villanueva said he only discussed walking to the tunnel with quarterback and captain Ben Roethlisberger and so many of his teammates weren't aware of what he was planning.
"When everybody sees an image of me standing by myself everybody thinks that the team, the Steelers are not behind me and that's absolutely wrong," he said. "It's quite the opposite because they all would have, the entire team would have been out there with me."
Villanueva was a captain and an Army Ranger who served three tours in Afghanistan and received several medals for his service, including the Bronze Star.
Related: NFL: No fines for teams that skipped national anthem

Protests during the national anthem began last year when former 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick took a knee to protest the treatment of black Americans, especially by the police.
During the press conference, Villanueva said he doesn't take offense to players kneeling.
"What people don't understand is people who are taking a knee are not saying anything negative about the military. They're not saying anything negative about the flag," Villanueva said.
"They're just trying to protest the fact that there is some injustices in America. And for people that stand up for the national anthem, it doesn't mean that they don't believe in these racial injustices; they're just trying to do the right thing."
Kaepernick's jersey also hit the top spot after he began the protest.
He pledged to donate all the money he made off jersey sales.
According to the agreement between the league and the players union, players get two-thirds of the money from jersey sales. The rest goes to the union, and some of that goes into a pool for all NFL players.


Here's what the vote could mean for Germany, Europe and the rest of the world.
A new government by Christmas?
With Germany's second biggest party -- the Social Democrats -- heading for a spell in opposition, Merkel has only one real option: a three-way coalition between her conservative CDU-CSU bloc and two smaller parties -- the liberal FDP and the Greens.
The parties have never governed together at national level, but earlier this year struck a deal to run the German state of Schleswig-Holstein.
"Coalition talks will be difficult, they always are," said Holger Schmieding, economist at Berenberg Bank. "But Merkel is good at bridging such differences."

Regardless of those skills, it will take time. Serious talks on forming a new government are unlikely to start until the middle of October, once the result of elections in the German state of Lower Saxony are known.
That means it may be December, or even early January, before the new government takes office.

It could be good for the economy
The three-way coalition could give an extra boost to the German and European economies.
Merkel's party and the FDP are likely to prioritize policies that favor business and trade, and all three have promised tax cuts. The Greens also want the government to spend more money supporting families.
Related: Germans are falling out of love with their carmakers
These policies would boost consumer spending, which could in turn lower Germany's trade surplus -- something that would please the country's European partners, as well as President Trump.
Still, any shift in overall economic policy is likely to be small.
"The big picture is that any fiscal boost will be modest," said Jennifer McKeown, chief European economist at Capital Economics. "None of the three parties plans to invest as much as the [Social Democrats] advocated and all of the major parties want to keep a balanced budget."
...but possibly bad for the car industry
The Greens are likely to push hard for their environmental policies. That could spell problems for German car makers, already shaken by the Volkswagen (VLKAY) diesel scandal and claims that they were operating a cartel.
Morgan Stanley economists said dealing with the fallout from these issues was likely to take center stage in German politics, given the importance of the automotive industry to the economy.

"On the whole, the Greens pursue more ambitious goals and a more radical response to the diesel scandal," Elga Bartsch and Jan Kozak wrote in a research note.
The Greens want to ban the registration of cars with combustion engines from 2030 -- a decade earlier than Britain and France have proposed. Merkel has hinted she could support a ban but has given no indication of the timing.
Shares in Volkswagen and BMW (BMWYY) slipped on Monday, despite narrow gains on German stock markets.
Related: Infrastructure is Germany's weak link
European integration could slow
The new government might take a more cautious approach to further integration between Europe's economies.
New French President Emmanuel Macron wants to push through radical reforms of the European Union. He argues that closer cooperation between countries that share the euro currency -- such as the introduction of a common finance minister and budget -- would make Europe stronger and more stable.
Before Sunday's election, Merkel had appeared willing to work with Macron on finding a consensus for reform. Now that might be harder for her, given the liberal FDP are skeptical.
"A final compromise should still see European integration move forward in the coming years. That said, it is likely to be at a slower pace than currently envisaged by Merkel and [Emmanuel] Macron," said Ricardo Garcia, economist at UBS.


Key Apple suppliers, such as chip companies Qorvo (QRVO), Broadcom (AVGO), Universal Display (OLED) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) have all slid since the iPhone launch as well.
The iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus went on sale last Friday, but customers have to wait until November for the more revolutionary iPhone X, which has no home button, an edge-to-edge screen, facial recognition and 3D animated emoji, or Animoji.
There have been reports of short lines at Apple stores and a general lack of enthusiasm for the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus, which are viewed as more evolutionary products.
Review: The iPhone 8 cuts the cord and prepares for the future
It kind of makes sense. Unless you are really bummed about not having a home button to press, why not just wait a few weeks for the iPhone X to come out?
Trip Chowdhry, an analyst with Global Equities Research based in California, wrote in a report over the weekend that customers he surveyed at six Apple stores were telling him exactly that.
"We did not come across even a single customer who said they purchased the new iPhone 8, because of any compelling feature or innovation," he wrote. "Many potential customers came, saw the iPhone 8 and left. They said they will pre-order iPhone X."
Chowdhry said that people who were buying an iPhone 8 or 8 Plus were mainly doing so to replace older iPhones that had something wrong with them, i.e. a cracked screen, little memory left over for photos and apps or slow performance.
Jun Zhang, an analyst with Rosenblatt Securities, added that the initial sales in China for the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus were not that strong either, falling below the opening weekend sales of the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus a year ago.

So should Apple investors be concerned? Probably not. Apple's stock is still up 30% this year. And it's only about 10% below the all-time high it hit earlier this month.
The company is worth three quarters of a trillion dollars and has more than $260 billion in cash at its disposal. So the recent pullback is hardly a sign of a coming iPocalypse for Apple.
Apple's shares have often soared before the unveiling of a new iPhone as details leak about specifications and new features, only to fall once consumers and investors realize that all the rumors were true.
But this time around there's the added wrinkle of there being several new iPhones coming out -- the 8 and Plus may be just mere incremental upgrades. The iPhone X, on the other hand, has a lot of new features that should excite consumers.
And that has the potential to really boost the company's results dramatically. Apple is in a bit of a funk. Wall Street expects sales for the current fiscal year, which ends on September 30, to be up just 6% and that earnings will increase by 8%.
That is relatively sluggish for Apple. But next year, thanks in large part to the iPhone X, analysts are forecasting a sales jump of 16% and a 22% boost in profits. So Apple investors probably don't need to be too concerned about the recent stock slump.


Players have been kneeling during the anthem since last year, when former 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick took a knee to protest the treatment of black Americans, particularly by the police.

NFL rules say teams have to be on the field at least 10 minutes before kickoff. Normally, skipping the anthem would violate that rule. Failure to be on the field on time typically results in a fine, NFL spokesman Joe Lockhart said.
Lockhart told reporters Monday there would be "no discipline" for teams that weren't on the field on Sunday.


That includes $1 million from Shahid Khan, the Pakistani-American owner of the Jacksonville Jaguars, who linked arms with his players during the National Anthem before his team's game in London.
In a statement, Khan also criticized Trump, who said that when any player disrespects the flag, owners should say, "Get that son of a bitch off the field right now."

The Kraft Group, the business of Patriots owner Robert Kraft, who has been a vocal supporter of Trump, also gave $1 million. So did Robert McNair, owner of the Houston Texans and a contributor to the Trump campaign.
Both issued statements critical of Trump's comments and supporting the right of players to take a knee during the anthem, as did Cleveland Browns owner Jimmy Haslam, who gave $100,000 to the inaugural along with $300,000 from his company.

Some of the owners who gave money to the inaugural issued statements supportive of players' right to take a knee during the anthem but not directly critical of Trump.
Those include Stan Kroenke, owner of the Los Angeles Rams, who gave $1 million, and Tampa Bay Buccaneers co-chairman Joel Glazer, whose brother and co-chairman, Ed, gave $250,000.
Christopher Johnson, who has run the Jets since Trump tapped his brother, Woody, to be ambassador to Britain, also issued a statement supportive of the players but not directly critical of Trump. Woody Johnson gave $1 million to the committee.

The committee collected $1 million each from two owners who did not address Trump's comments this weekend: Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, who gave through a corporation, and Washington Redskins owner Daniel Snyder.
Jones, whose Cowboys play Monday night, had earlier had been critical of players who protested during the anthem. Snyder's Redskins issued a statement that did not directly make reference to the anthem protests or Trump and also did not mention Snyder by name.
Correction: An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated the relationship between Jets CEO Christopher Johnson and Woody Johnson, U.S. ambassador to the United Kingdom. They are brothers.

The number of Germans at risk of slipping into poverty is the highest since the country was reunited in 1990, and that risk is greatest in what used to be East Germany.
Here's a look at German inequality by the numbers:
Income for the rich up 27%
Germany's economy grew by 22% between 1991 and 2014, helping to fuel income growth of 12%.
But the benefits have not been shared equally.
The richest 10% of households saw their real incomes jump by 27% between 1991 and 2014, according to the German Institute for Economic Research. Middle class incomes increased by 9% over the same period, while households at the bottom saw their incomes drop by 8%.
Wages paid to workers increased by 5% between 2000 and 2016. Meanwhile, income from investments and business activities jumped by 30%.
Related: Germany's hidden hunger
Markus Grabka, an economist with the German Institute for Economic Research, said that weaker labor unions, tax reforms that benefited the rich and an increase in single person households have contributed to inequality.
Outsourcing and automation have made the situation even worse.
10% own 60% of the wealth
The income gap has translated into major differences in wealth.
The richest 10% the population owns 60% of assets, while the bottom 40% have almost nothing, according to Germany's central bank.
Inequality has risen steadily since 2005 despite unemployment dropping to record lows, according to Grabka.
Grabka said the big question is whether all households "benefit from the strong recovery of the German economy."
Huge efforts have been made to develop the poorer East since it was reunited with West Germany.
But the risk of slipping into poverty is still significantly higher today in former Communist territory, where many industry towns have experienced a steady decline.
"A large share of companies were closed in East Germany and the post-reunification construction boom [ran out in the 1990s]," said Oliver Rakau, chief Germany economist at Oxford Economics.

16%: The risk of falling into poverty
The share of Germans at risk of falling into poverty has jumped from 11% two decades ago to 16% in 2014.
Grabka said that another key factor is an increasing number of jobs that don't pay well.
Nearly 7 million Germans are working part time, precarious "mini jobs" that pay up to €450 ($540) a month. Many rely on welfare payments to get by.

Germany introduced a national minimum wage in 2015 in hopes of tackling the problem, an initiative supported by Merkel.
But the chancellor, whose slogan is "prosperity and security for all," was largely silent on the issue of inequality during the campaign.
Her main challenger, Martin Schulz, paid more attention to the issue, arguing that Germany's export success has been built on low wages.

2. Negotiation nations: Negotiators are meeting on Monday over two important trade topics: Brexit and NAFTA.
Britain and the EU are taking another stab at Brexit negotiations, after Prime Minister Theresa May tried to inject new impetus into the talks with a speech Friday. She said Britain would seek a transitional arrangement of about two years, effectively delaying the impact of Brexit until 2021.
But the EU wants to see much more detail concerning the rights of millions of European migrants, and exactly how much Britain is prepared to pay in a divorce bill, before it will move on to discuss future trading arrangements.
Separately, the renegotiation of NAFTA, the trade deal between the U.S., Canada and Mexico, is continuing.
Little progress has been made so far on key issues, such as car manufacturing. The third round of talks began on Saturday in Ottawa and will run through Wednesday.

3. Stock surge -- Imagination Technologies: Shares in Imagination Technologies (IGNMF) were surging by about 32% in London after the tech firm said it had agreed to be acquired for £550 million ($744 million) by a Chinese-backed private equity firm called Canyon Bridge.
Imagination Technologies owns and licenses intellectual property that helps power the graphics on the screens of Apple's iPhones, tablets, iPods, TVs and watches.
Imagination fell on hard times earlier this year after Apple (AAPL, Tech30) told the British firm it plans to stop licensing the company's technology after about two years. That news sent Imagination shares crashing by as much as 72%.
However, investors aren't 100% convinced the deal will be done because Canyon Bridge's planned takeover of Lattice Semiconductors (LSCC) was blocked earlier this month by President Trump on national security concerns. The British government has said it will consider blocking foreign takeovers of critical infrastructure to protect national security.

The devastation at Puerto Rico's biggest airport is another in a series of operational blows to U.S. airlines. Houston, Miami, Orlando and other airports across the southeastern U.S. have been shuttered as a result of extreme weather causing thousands of flight cancellations and forcing airlines to adapt amidst the cascading disruption.
Some airlines this weekend described a bleak scene in Puerto Rico.
"Due to connectivity challenges, including air traffic control constraints and lack of power at the airport, operations are limited for all airlines," said American Airlines (AAL) in a statement.

The company said it has been able to send in resources on relief flights.
Its first trip of that kind was Friday, when a plane took relief workers and family members from Miami to the island, along with food, water, lanterns, cots, tarps, fans, batteries, boots and generators. The airline sent just one more plane to the island over the weekend.

United Airlines (UAL) said it sent a relief flight to the island Saturday with "15,000 pounds of food, water and amenity kits for our employees." Another plane on Sunday took blankets and other supplies. United said an additional cargo trip is planned for Monday.

Late Saturday, JetBlue Airways (JBLU) said that it planned to send three planes to Puerto Rico and fly three planes from the island to certain cities in Florida and New York on Sunday.
"These flights are carrying much needed supplies and personnel," JetBlue said at the time, adding that it expects to have a more robust flight schedule in and out of San Juan by Tuesday. The company did not respond to a request for comment Sunday.
Southwest Airlines (LUV) was slated to resume flights on Saturday, but the company said it was met with some unexpected issues. It was only able to send an "assessment flight" into San Juan over the weekend.
The company was still "struggling with the lack of infrastructure and coordination" at the San Juan airport, Southwest spokesperson Thais Hanson said Sunday. She added that regular service likely won't resume until Wednesday.
Delta (DAL), which was also expected to restart some of its San Juan operations Saturday, reported an "unfavorable assessments of airport and area infrastructure."
Delta said it operated just one relief flight Sunday. It plans to send two more Monday.

2. NAFTA talks, Round 3: The renegotiation of NAFTA, the trade deal between the U.S., Canada and Mexico that President Trump promised to blow up, is continuing.
Little if any visible progress has been made so far on key issues, such as car manufacturing. The third round of talks began on Saturday in Ottawa and run through Wednesday.
All sides are signaling that they plan to bring a heavier hand this time.
One highlight: American officials are expected to propose a controversial new "sunset clause" to NAFTA, which means the agreement would expire after five years unless all countries decide to sign on for another five years.
"It would force a systematic reexamination" of NAFTA, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said at an event hosted by Politico on September 14. Critics say it would cause widespread uncertainty in the business community.
3. Brexit talks, Round 4: Britain and the European Union will take another stab at Brexit negotiations on Monday.
Both parties still need to sort out the rights of millions of migrants, trade terms and the size of the divorce bill Britain will pay the EU.
Earlier this month, British Parliament voted in favor of a bill that ensures European laws won't apply to the United Kingdom once Brexit is completed in 2019.
The vote was a victory for Prime Minister Theresa May, who has been under mounting pressure to unite her government.
4. The week ahead in Washington: It was supposed to be (another) pivotal moment in the Republicans' attempts to replace Obamacare. That was until Senator John McCain said he wouldn't support the latest bill, known as Graham-Cassidy.
Tax reform remains on the docket this week. Republicans may release a framework of their plan to cut taxes. How much detail is not clear.
5. Earnings: Nike is set to report quarterly financial results on Tuesday. Nike (NKE) faces stiff competition from Adidas, which last week became the second best seller of American footwear.
The owner of Olive Garden is also reporting earnings on Tuesday. Darden Restaurants (DRI) enjoyed a jump in sales when it reported earnings last quarter. This time around, investors are expecting to see sales of around $1.9 billion.

American officials have proposed a deeply controversial audit rule. Canadian officials want to resolve a thorny aerospace issue. And Mexican leaders continue to prepare a "plan B" by looking overseas for new trade deals.
Related: Mexico looks to Latin America amid Trump's NAFTA threats
Here's what to look out for:
"Sunset clause"
Trump's trade team is expected to propose a "sunset clause" to NAFTA, which means the agreement would expire after five years unless all countries decide to sign on for another five years.
Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross argues that the presidents of the three nations can already withdraw from NAFTA if they give six month's notice. In 23 years, the provision has never been used.
This new provision would allow leaders to reassess benefits on a timetable, Ross says.
"It would force a systematic reexamination," of NAFTA, Ross said at an event hosted by Politico on September 14.
Critics say it would cause widespread uncertainty in the business community.
"It's probably one of the worst ideas that anyone has ever suggested," says Rick Helfenbein, CEO of the American Apparel and Footwear Association, whose members include Under Armour, Gap and Coach. "Why would you invest in something that could expire in 5 years?"
Mexican and Canadian officials not directly involved in talks have already pushed back on the idea.

Mexico's back up plans
Mexico may be in danger of losing business with the U.S. and Canada if NAFTA negotiations go south. So it's doubling down on free trade and turning toward allies in Latin America, who are also changing their own tune on trade.
This year, for the first time, 94% of goods moved tax-free across borders in the Pacific Alliance, a trading bloc that includes Mexico, Colombia, Chile and Peru. Formed in 2011, it accounts for half of all trade in the region and covers about 200 million people.
"We are trading as a group of countries in agreement on free trade," Mexico's foreign minister, Luis Videgaray, said Wednesday evening in New York. Videgaray spoke alongside the presidents of Colombia and Chile, as well as a Peru's trade minister.
NAFTA's "scariest part"
At the heart of the reason behind renegotiating is Trump's desire to end the U.S. trade deficit with Mexico and create manufacturing jobs in America.
Trump's trade team wants to focus automobiles and the "rules of origin" rule, which stipulates that at least 62% of the parts in a car sold in North America must come from one of the three NAFTA countries.
But Ross argues 25-year-old rule is out of date for a auto world that includes Bluetooth speakers, back-up cameras and other electronics.
The outdated rule has allowed car parts from outside NAFTA -- mostly from China and Taiwan -- to come in and not get taxed, he said. He told CNBC Friday that this trend is the "scariest part" of NAFTA.
Ross wants to not only update the rules, but raise that percentage much higher, though how much is unclear.
Forcing more production in North America is one thing. Forcing more in the U.S. is another, trade experts say.
"I don't think it will go over very well," says Edward Alden, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. "We're going from the shadow boxing phase in the first rounds of negotiations to really much more serious negotiations."

Wells Fargo did not indicate the layoffs were in any way linked to a series of crises that have plagued the company in recent months.
Most notably, the company continues to suffer the fallout of a massive fake account scandal that first came to light last year. Recent estimates say the bank created as many as 1.4 million accounts for unsuspecting customers in order to boost its sales figures.
Wells Fargo has blamed draconian sales targets and poor oversight. Its recovery efforts have included installing new corporate leadership and firing about 5,300 employees who Wells Fargo said were involved in creating fake accounts.
The bank's headaches were made worse when it admitted to forcing about 570,000 of its customers to sign up for auto insurance that they didn't need. Wells Fargo has also been accused of modifying mortgages without getting customers' consent.
Wells Fargo still faces a slew of investigations, including from the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Justice.
The company said in January that it's closing about 400 bank branches as online and mobile banking have continued to shake up the banking industry.

HHS officials disclosed this information Friday during a webinar with community groups that help people enroll in Obamacare.
Outages occurred under the Obama administration, as well, but they weren't as frequent. Typically, the online enrollment system was only shut down for a few hours at a time and it was much less frequent than once a week, former officials said.
"There is just a really big question as to why this is happening," said Lori Lodes, former CMS communications director.
The current administration said that the maintenance schedule was provided in advance to accommodate requests from the groups that assist applicants.
"Maintenance outages are regularly scheduled on healthcare.gov every year during open enrollment. This year is no different," a spokesperson said. "System downtime is planned for the lowest-traffic time periods on healthcare.gov including Sunday evenings and overnight."
Related: Trump slashing Obamacare advertising by 90%
The Trump administration has come under attack from critics who say that it is intentionally undermining the Affordable Care Act through regulatory actions. It cut the enrollment period, slashed money for advertising by 90% and sliced the budget for navigators to help people shop for plans.
The fact that HHS is now closing the site for a portion of each weekend upset many consumer advocates. Many working Americans — the prime target group for ACA insurance — might be shopping at just that time.
"Argh," was the reaction of Shelli Quenga, program director at the Palmetto Project in South Carolina, a nonprofit group that received about $1 million to help with outreach and enrollment in the past 12 months. This month, HHS cut her budget in half for this year's open enrollment.
Open enrollment season this year runs from Nov. 1 to Dec. 15, less than half the time people have had to sign up during the first four years of the exchanges created under the Affordable Care Act.
More than 12 million people enrolled on the state and federal marketplaces for 2017 coverage, including more than 9 million on the federal exchange. Some customers drop out over the course of the year as they get jobs or stop paying premiums.

Advocates were already nervous that fewer people would sign up during the shortened period this time around.

He noted that 10 p.m. Mountain Time is often a relatively popular time for people to enroll online.

Delta Air Lines plans to replace its smaller regional jets with more spacious C Series on flights up to 1,500 nautical miles -- or about three hours of flying time.
The C Series has been flying passengers in Europe since June 2016, and starting next year, the Bombardier CS100 will start appearing at airports around the U.S.
But Boeing, America's largest exporter and sole U.S. producer of commercial airliners, is suing Bombardier. At issue is whether funds Bombardier received from the Canadian government to stay afloat allowed the plane maker to sell to Delta for what Boeing alleges were "absurdly low prices."
Boeing maintains the government support helped its Canadian rival establish the all-new airliner at the expense of Boeing's own 737 jets. It claims that Bombardier is selling each C Series jet to Delta for $19.6 million. That's not accurate, said Delta.
The jet's list price is nearly $80 million, but steep discounts are common.
The U.S. International Trade Commission, an arm of the Commerce Department, is expected to make the first of two rulings on the dispute as early as September 26.
Bombardier refutes the claims. It says a deal with Delta for up to 125 planes was standard practice for an industry that wants big names to endorse its products. Delta said the complaint is "without merit."
Related: Justin Trudeau warns Boeing over trade dispute
Boeing has recommended a 160% tariff on the jet, paid by Delta or any U.S. airline importing the aircraft. That would mean that for every dollar Delta pays Bombardier for the jet, it would have to write a check to the U.S. Treasury for another $1.60.
And while Boeing leaders emphasize its grievance should be limited to this one deal for this one airplane, the suit is widely considered an existential threat to the Canadian plane maker should it be shut out of U.S. -- the largest aviation market in the world.

International implications
The dispute has drawn in the leaders of Canada and the United Kingdom and now threatens to shoot down a $5.2 billion Boeing F/A-18 Super Hornet fighter deal with the Royal Canadian Air Force if the case isn't dropped or settled out of the ITC.
"We won't do business with a company that's busy trying to sue us and put our aerospace workers out of business," said Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Monday. Bombardier's aerospace division employs 28,500 worldwide, including 4,000 in Northern Ireland where the jet's wings are manufactured.
And more than half of the jet is manufactured in the U.S., including its Pratt & Whitney engines. That has drawn letters of support by members of Congress and even U.S. airlines like JetBlue Airways and Spirit Airlines, which want a viable third competitor to Boeing and Airbus.
Related: U.K. to Trump: You can save jobs by fixing Boeing-Bombardier fight
If the deal survives, Bombardier says any tariff would negate the operating savings the C Series brings and be passed along to passengers in the form of higher fares.
The spat is part of larger trade tensions brewing between the U.S. and Canada. The Trump Administration already slapped the Canadian timber industry with a 20% tariff on imports.
Barely Survived Its Birth
To understand how this case came to be, you first need to understand that this tiny jetliner nearly killed its maker.
Launched in 2008, the C Series was supposed to be ready in 2013. But Bombardier was beset by engine and software issues and the sheer complexity of designing an all new airplane. It was delayed by three years and went billions of dollars over budget.
Bombardier required a radical overhaul to stay afloat. The scion of the family-owned business stepped aside. An outside CEO came in. Thousands were laid off. The Quebec provincial government pumped $1 billion into the company and the federal government handed over about $282 million in loans. The C Series is now 49.5% owned by the taxpayers of Quebec.
Boeing alleges that the state aid to keep the lights on at Bombardier allowed the company to sharply cut the C Series price tag for Delta.
Bombardier at the time needed a big win. The C Series had sold poorly for years, muscled out by Boeing and Airbus. The airline lost out on a chance to join United Airlines' fleet earlier in 2016. The Delta deal for up to 125 jets was widely considered a must-win for the airline.
And it was. By the time the ink was dry in March 2016, Bombardier's CEO Alain Bellemare conceded to The Wall Street Journal: "We knew that we would need to be competitive to get some marquee airlines."
"So we've done just that," he said.
Delta's Deal
Delta knocked on the Canadian airplane maker's door and got, what Boeing has alleged, a deal so good that it violated international trade laws.
Delta's price tag for the planes isn't a mystery. It was disclosed as part of the ITC investigation but redacted from public documents reviewed by CNN. Two people familiar with the deal said each plane was in the "high $20 millions."
"These campaigns help determine whether a new airplane will thrive or die. That's why Bombardier is willing to lose millions of dollars per plane on this sale," said Boeing Vice Chairman Ray Conner in testimony to the ITC. "That's what Bombardier bought with Canada's subsidies -- a seal of approval for the C Series jets."
But does the price tag for those jets - which are smaller than anything Boeing has made since 2006 - constitute illegal dumping? And was Boeing harmed by the deal?
Adam Pilarski, Senior Vice President at aerospace consultancy Avitas said politics, not planes, are motivating the suit. Boeing has more than 4,400 737s on order and is in the process of increasing production to meet skyrocketing demand.
Further, Pilarski said Boeing has no idea what price Delta paid for the jets nor does it know how much it costs Bombardier to make each jet.
Nor does Bombardier. The Canadian plane maker has delivered fewer than 20 planes. And tallying production costs of something as advanced as a jetliner takes a lot of repetition before a "learning curve" on spending is clear, said Pilarski, former chief economist for McDonnell Douglas.
"This is total Looney Tunes, it doesn't make any frickin' sense whatsoever," said Pilarski, former chief economist for McDonnell Douglas. "You cannot establish the facts that Boeing asserts."


San Francisco and Oakland fear that billions of dollars of property in low-lying areas will be swamped by rising sea levels that scientists blame on climate change.
"These fossil fuel companies profited handsomely for decades while knowing they were putting the fate of our cities at risk," San Francisco City Attorney Dennis Herrera said in a statement announcing the lawsuits, which were filed in Superior Court in San Francisco and Alameda Counties.
In San Francisco, which is surrounded by water on three sides, at least $10 billion of public property and $39 billion of private property is at risk from rising sea levels, the lawsuit estimates. Oakland warns that rising sea levels will "disproportionately impact and endanger" low-income people and minorities, as well as the city's airport.
These concerns have been heightened by the devastating impact of Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria on parts of the United States and Caribbean in recent weeks.
As CNN has reported, the consensus among scientists is that the consequences of climate change -- rising sea levels and warming oceans -- made these hurricanes worse than they would have been in the past. That's because rising sea levels make storm surges from hurricanes worse, while warming waters help intensify the storms themselves.
The San Francisco lawsuit alleges that leading oil companies for decades ignored scientists who "warned them in stark terms that fossil fuel usage would cause global warming" that poses "'catastrophic' harm."
Worse, Exxon and other oil companies have been accused of downplaying these risks to the public.
Related: Harvard study: Exxon 'misled the public' on climate change
Comparing Big Oil to tobacco companies, San Francisco and Oakland argue that oil companies engaged in an "organized campaign to deceive consumers about the dangers of massive fossil fuel production."
That argument may be strengthened by a recent Harvard study. The research found that for nearly 40 years Exxon publicly raised doubt about the dangers of climate change even as scientists inside the oil company acknowledged the growing threat. "We conclude that ExxonMobil misled the public," the peer-reviewed study said.
Exxon (XOM) has dismissed that Harvard study as "inaccurate and preposterous" and claims it was "paid for, written and published by activists."
Exxon,BP (BP) and ConocoPhillips did not provide comments in response to the California lawsuits.
Chevron, which is based in San Ramon, California, said it "welcomes serious attempts to address the issue of climate change, but these suits do not do that."
Shell (RDSA) reiterated that it has "long recognized the climate challenge." However, the company said this complex issue should be addressed through policy and cultural change, "not by the courts."
The American Petroleum Industry, a lobbying group, said in a statement that the natural gas and oil industry "will continue to play a leading role in driving down U.S. greenhouse gas and other emissions."
But some California cities fear it may be too late to avoid the consequences of climate change.
"The global warming-induced sea level from past fossil fuel usage," the San Francisco lawsuit said, "is an irreversible condition on any relevant time scale: it will last hundreds or even thousands of years."


Here are some of the revenue raisers under consideration that may help them get there:
For individual tax cuts:
For tax reforms that affect individuals, there's been discussion of several possible offsets.
They include: further limiting the mortgage interest deduction; changing the tax treatment of 401(k) contributions, and repealing the state and local tax deduction.
Related: Trump says the U.S. is the highest taxed country in the world. It's not.
None of these options are particularly popular.
Capping the mortgage interest deduction could raise between $100 billion and $300 billion over a decade, according to the Tax Foundation.
The 401(k) change, meanwhile, is considered a budget gimmick. It would raise some money in the short-term by taxing employee contributions into workplace retirement plans, but it would actually lose revenue in the long run since people could withdraw their money from those accounts tax free in retirement.
A repeal of the state and local tax deduction is considered most likely since it would bring in the most money, raising north of $1 trillion over a decade by some estimates.
While the deduction has been on the books for more than 100 years, and lawmakers have tried (unsuccessfully) to repeal it before, some political observers and policy analysts say this time may be different.
For corporate tax cuts:
When it comes to paying for corporate tax cuts, there aren't as many options, especially if lawmakers opt to seriously slash today's 35% corporate rate.
"There are very few politically palatable revenue raisers or base broadeners available that can be used to help reduce the corporate tax rate to 20% or below," Tax Foundation president Scott Hodge told the Senate Finance Committee this week.
The biggest pay-for being considered is a repeal of the interest deductibility on corporate debt.
Currently, a company can deduct the interest it pays to its bondholders and on its bank loans. If the interest deduction were fully repealed, it could bring in about $1.4 trillion in the first decade and twice that in the second decade, said Kyle Pomerleau, federal projects director at the Tax Foundation.
Related: Trump is right. The corporate rate should be 15%. But it's not that simple.
Repealing the interest deduction fully or partially has been discussed as a way to pay for a proposal to allow for much more generous expensing provisions on capital investments -- whether it's buying new equipment or a new building.
But firms that are highly leveraged -- such as many in the real estate industry or foreign companies that do business in the United States and pay interest on their U.S. loans back to their parent companies abroad -- will push back hard against repealing interest deductibility, even if they might benefit from more generous expensing rules.
"By increasing the cost of capital, tax limitations on business debt could dramatically reduce real estate investment, reducing property values across the country, and discouraging entrepreneurship and responsible risk-taking," Jeffrey D. DeBoer, the head of the Real Estate Roundtable, told members of the Senate Finance Committee.


Now her legacy could be the biggest ownership shakeup in the French firm's 108-year history.
Back in 2004, Bettencourt and Nestle (NSRGF), L'Oreal's second biggest shareholder, agreed that neither of them would increase their stakes in the company during her lifetime, and for six months after her death.
The deal was designed to secure the family's influence over L'Oreal and prevent Nestle mounting a takeover. The agreement will lapse in March 2018.
"Bettencourt dies. Clock is now ticking," analysts at Jefferies wrote in a note.
"What should be respected as a melancholic end to an era for the Bettencourts is now set to be subsumed by speculation around the future of Nestle's 23% stake in L'Oreal," they added.
Shares in L'Oreal jumped as much as 4% on Friday on the possibility that Nestle might make a move to increase its stake -- possibly via a takeover.
But it is far from clear whether the Bettencourt family would want to sell its stake. In a statement Friday, it said it was entirely committed and loyal to L'Oreal.
Nestle said it was "not the right time to make a comment" when asked about the future of its stake.
"We express our most sincere condolences and deepest sympathy to Mrs. Bettencourt's family and to all at L'Oréal at this difficult moment," a spokesman said.

However, some analysts say Nestle may be thinking about ditching its stake in the medium term.
"We think a disposal... is more likely than a takeover given the diverging strategic paths of the two companies over the last decade," analysts at UBS said.
That would certainly please some Nestle investors, chief among them hedge fund star Dan Loeb, who disclosed a $3.5 billion stake in Nestle in June.
Loeb described Nestle's stake in L'Oreal as "not strategic" and suggested shareholders should be free to choose whether they wanted to invest in Nestle or L'Oreal, or some combination of the two.
L'Oreal had revenues of €25.8 billion ($31 billion) in 2016, making it the world's biggest cosmetics company. (Major competitors such as Procter & Gamble (PG) and Unilever (UL) generate a lot of revenue from other businesses.)
Nestle first bought a stake in L'Oreal in 1974, when the family was worried about the company being nationalized.

Bettencourt joined her father's company as a 15-year old apprentice, and inherited his stake in 1957. She served on the company's board until 2012.
She stepped down from the board at the age of 89 and was succeeded by her grandson after a bitter legal dispute with her daughter, Francoise Bettencourt-Meyers, who argued Bettencourt was not mentally competent to handle her own affairs.
For years, the so-called "Bettencourt Affair" captivated France.
At the height of the scandal, when Bettencourt-Meyers sought legal action to have her mother declared incapable, the heiress gave a series of feisty interviews in which she told her daughter to mind her own business.

Its roads could also use some work: In 2017, Germany's road network slid to 16th in the World Economic Forum's Global Competitiveness Report, the latest in a series of downgrades.
Experts warn that Germany is at risk of falling behind if it does not invest more, advice that Chancellor Angela Merkel, who is campaigning to win a fourth term in elections on Sunday, says she has taken to heart.
Her critics, both foreign and domestic, say that much more could be done.
Germany has long been criticized by its neighbors because it exports more goods than it purchases from abroad, a dynamic that makes it difficult for other European countries to keep their trade deficits in check and remain competitive.

More spending by the German government -- on infrastructure, for example -- would help boost the economy and spur business spending. The windfall would encourage German consumers to spend more on foreign services and imported goods, ultimately reducing the country's trade surplus.
"Government investment is a good way to stimulate demand," said Stephen Brown, an economist at Capital Economics. "[Germany is] not recognizing that there could be a link ... between public sector and private sector investment."
Yet the German government -- which wants to avoid a budget deficit -- is reluctant to increase spending too much.
The German government invested just over €66 billion ($79 billion) in 2016 on things like roads, child care facilities, energy efficient buildings and public transportation, according to data from the country's finance ministry.
To put that in perspective, experts believe Russia spent about $50 billion on the Sochi Olympics alone.
Investment has increased by an average of 4.5% over the past two years, but infrastructure spending as a share of the economy (2.1%) remains much lower than other wealthy Western countries including the U.S., Britain, France, Canada and Sweden.
"Germans will be skeptical of infrastructure investment for the sake of infrastructure investment. They want to see what the point is," said Charles Lichfield, an analyst at Eurasia Group.
Related: Rich Germany has an inequality problem
Merkel has campaigned on the promise of infrastructure upgrades and improved internet speeds (German broadband ranks 25th in the world). But some local governments, which are responsible for funneling money to projects like school upgrades, have a reputation for moving at a snail's pace.
"It's up to them to spend it," said Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Germany's Berenberg Bank.
Schmieding said the federal government is trying to direct more money to poorer regions with the biggest infrastructure problems, but progress has been slow.
"In a highly developed country with a lot of rules... the pace at which you can step up money spending is actually slow," he said.

American Airlines (AAL) was the first U.S. airline to restore service. A flight from Miami to San Juan took off just before 7 a.m. ET, about an hour later than scheduled.
Besides passengers, American said it would fly much-needed supplies, including food, water, lanterns, cots, tarps, fans, batteries, boots and generators, to Puerto Rico for use by its employees and their families. Authorities in Puerto Rico say it could be months before power is restored.
JetBlue operated two relief flights to the island. One carried supplies. Another carried New York state officials, including Gov. Andrew Cuomo, and emergency personnel who will assist with recovery efforts. Included on the flight are 10 engineers, planners, technical supervisors and translators from the New York State Power Authority to assess how to get power restored.

It says that by 2022 it will offer customers at least one electrified alternative in all vehicle segments.

Trump has been pushing China to use its deep economic ties with North Korea to pressure Kim Jong Un's regime to back down from developing nuclear weapons. China is estimated to account for roughly 90% of North Korea's foreign trade, with money and goods flowing back and forth across a land border that runs for 880 miles.
On Friday, China announced it would limit its exports of refined petroleum products to North Korea beginning in October 1 to comply with U.N. resolutions.
The Chinese Ministry of Commerce said in a statement that exports of condensate oil, liquefied natural gas as well as textile imports from the North are currently prohibited.

Trump's big 'experiment'
Even though China has supported a series of tough U.N. resolutions this year targeting a growing portion of North Korea's economy, many experts are skeptical that Chinese officials and companies are fully applying the sanctions.
That's where the new powers Trump gave Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin come in. They enable him to cut off access to the U.S. financial system and freeze the assets of any company or individual doing business with North Korea, measures known as secondary sanctions.
Those are serious threats for major Chinese banks, which had $142 billion of assets in the U.S. at the end of March, according to the Federal Reserve. U.S. dollars are the lifeblood of the global financial system and banks operating internationally need easy access to them.
"We are about to run the most significant experiment in the use of secondary sanctions on North Korea to date, and perhaps the most significant such experiment with respect to any country ever," wrote Stephan Haggard, a North Korea expert at the University of California, San Diego.

Alarm bells in banks
The executive order that Trump signed Thursday is likely to have set off alarm bells around the globe.
"Every single big bank in the world has sent or will be sending a memo to their compliance teams," Haggard said. "Those teams in turn will be scrambling to figure out if they have any North Korea risk."
But it's uncertain exactly how Chinese banks will respond.
Earlier this month, China ordered its financial institutions to take a number of steps to comply with past U.N. resolutions, including halting business with sanctioned individuals and companies. And employees at some major Chinese banks told CNNMoney that they were no longer opening new accounts for any North Koreans.
Related: Will latest U.N. sanctions make Kim Jong Un sweat?
Unprecedented pressure
Those measures did not go far enough for Trump.
The North Korean regime is believed to use a complex network of front companies to do business in China and other countries to dodge sanctions. Trump's new order has put the onus on banks and other firms to find out whether the businesses they're dealing with have any kind of North Korean connection.
Banks that may have previously looked the other way now have a strong incentive to pay close attention or risk severe punishment. If they all begin cutting off business with North Korea, the impact would be felt immediately.
"It's something that the North Koreans have never really faced before," said Ruggiero, a former official at the State and Treasury departments who specialized in financial sanctions and weapons proliferation issues.

Too big to sanction?
But the new U.S. measures still come with limitations.
Experts say cutting off a major Chinese bank from the U.S. financial system could have unforeseen consequences, such as a chain reaction of defaults that could ripple through the world's second largest economy and beyond. Beijing, which has strongly opposed sanctions against its companies, could retaliate against U.S. interests.
Ruggiero said there are still less drastic measures available, such as slapping a big fine on a high-profile Chinese bank to deter others.
"I certainly don't rule out that this administration could decide that a North Korean nuclear weapon on an ICBM is a big enough threat to overrule the concerns that [crippling sanctions on a big Chinese bank] could harm both economies and crack the trade relationship," he said. "But...there are things that can be done before getting there."
'Parallel universe of banks'
Other factors could also blunt the effectiveness of the new U.S. measures.
There may be smaller Chinese banks and firms dealing with Kim's regime that have little or no exposure to the U.S. financial system, Haggard said. North Korea is also believed to have an array of illicit revenue sources, such as cyberattacks, drugs and weapons.
"If the sanctions don't have the anticipated effect, it could be because North Korea has a... parallel universe of banks and firms that simply are immune" to the executive order, Haggard wrote.

The Congressional Budget Office has yet to release its evaluation of the bill Cassidy co-authored with Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina. Its reviews of earlier GOP bills in the House and Senate found that at least 22 million fewer people would have coverage by 2026, compared to current law.
It's difficult to say exactly what the coverage losses would be under the Graham-Cassidy bill, experts say. That's largely because it would give a lot of control over health care to the states, while at the same time curtailing federal funding. Their decisions will affect how many of their residents have coverage.
Related: Trump says GOP's health bill protects pre-existing conditions. Here's the truth
Here's how it would work: The legislation would eliminate Obamacare's Medicaid expansion, as well as federal premium and cost-sharing subsidies to buy policies on the exchanges. Instead, states would get a pot of money through 2026, and it would be up to them to figure out how to spend it on health care.
But that pot would be smaller than it would be under Obamacare -- by $107 billion, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Plus, the money would be redistributed so many states that expanded Medicaid -- which saw the greatest coverage gains under the health reform law -- would lose some of their funding, while those that didn't expand would get more.
Also, like the prior GOP efforts, the Graham-Cassidy bill would eliminate the individual mandate. That alone would result in about 15 million fewer insured Americans next year, CBO says.
Related: What's in the latest Obamacare repeal bill?
The bill would also shrink federal support of Medicaid by sending states a set amount of funds per enrollee or a lump sum -- again, leaving it up to governors and legislators to decide how to use the money. A per enrollee cap would cut federal spending by $53 billion between 2020 and 2026, compared to current law, Kaiser found.
Most states, however, don't have the wherewithal to make up the difference so it's likely they'll tighten enrollment, curtail benefits or trim provider rates.
"The flexibility states will be given under the bill is where to cut, how much to cut and who to cut," said Sabrina Corlette, research professor at Georgetown University's Health Policy Institute. "You can't take that much money out of the system and expect more people to continue to get affordable coverage. It just doesn't add up."

Friday -- OPEC and non-OPEC oil ministers meet in Vienna


It seems at last someone is doing something. Which is exactly what the managing director of the IMF, Christine Lagarde, wants. In New York this week, she told me the IMF believes $2 trillion dollars a year are squandered through corrupt activity. The examples are legendary: bridges built to nowhere, unnecessary stadiums built, capital cities constructed....all greased with the oil of backhanders and bribes. 
Lagarde is determined to make a start in stamping this out, and she believes the best way is via transparency and openness. She told me, "We have actually stopped financing a program until such time when what was covered up, what was done in the shadows, comes out transparently and is disclosed in the public account." Lagarde believes that "transparency, just like the sun, is the best disinfectant." 
Saying it and doing something about it are two different things, as the South African case shows.  The Gupta scandal has been rumbling for years, and it was only the release of hacked emails that finally got things moving.
It is a start. If the IMF is making it clear that corruption won't be tolerated, it does send a message, albeit one that must be buttressed by enforcement, criminal charges and ultimately prison for those convicted.
Christine Lagarde is right; Sunshine is the best disinfectant when it comes to corruption. As the song says, "Let the sun shine".

"I'm very proud to tell you that, as you may have just heard moments ago, China, their central bank has told their other banks — that's a massive banking system — to immediately stop doing business with North Korea," he said alongside South Korean President Moon Jae-in and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in New York.
Related: Trump announces sanctions on North Korea
The Chinese government has yet to publicly announce any action.
What do the new sanctions allow U.S. officials to do?
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson now have more power than ever to slap a range of sanctions aimed at curbing North Korea's nuclear efforts. Mnuchin will be able to freeze assets of any individual or business that trades in goods, services or technology with Pyongyang.
"Foreign financial institutions are now on notice that going forward they can choose to do business with the United States or North Korea, but not both," Mnuchin said.
The U.S. government can now also target companies in a range of industries: banks, energy, manufacturing, textiles and fishing. Even ships and aircraft that go to North Korea would be banned from the United States for 180 days.
Mnuchin said the new executive order -- effective Sept. 21 -- will be "forward looking" and not target past financial transactions. He declined to comment on any plans to impose further sanctions.
Will the order target U.S. banks, too?
No, not exactly. U.S. financial institutions -- like JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, Bank of America -- are already barred by law from pursuing any financial transactions directly or indirectly with North Korea. But those banks will now risk having their own assets frozen or being shut out of the U.S. financial system. They'll have to be even better at keeping a close eye on who they are doing business with and whether those companies have ties to North Korea.
"If banks really want to investigate their own North Korean transactions, they're going to need to investigate the companies, and the companies that do business with those companies," said Anthony Ruggiero, a senior fellow at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies.
What countries will Trump's order target most?
This one is harder to square. The administration says, "Everyone." But not everyone does business with North Korea. The isolated country typically does business with a limited number of countries -- China, Russia and South Korea, among them. China is by far North Korea's largest trading partner.
Related: North Korea still making millions from small arms exports
But Mnuchin repeatedly said that Thursday's step was not targeted at China alone.
"This action is directed at everyone. It is in no way directed specifically at China. We look forward to working very closely with them," Mnuchin said.
Recent disclosures show North Korea used Chinese banks to process at least $2.2 billion in transactions through the U.S. financial system between 2009 to 2017, according to Ruggiero.
Did China's central bank take action against North Korea?
That's not really clear. Reuters, citing unnamed sources, reported that the People's Bank of China had told its own financial institutions to stop dealing with North Korea's regime.
But Mnuchin was later asked multiple times by reporters to confirm that, but he demurred.
"I'm not going to make any comments about what they did earlier or what they did today," said Mnuchin. "We look forward to working with them in a cooperative way. The way we look forward to working with all of our partners."

"The purported performance reports were false, and -- as in all Ponzi schemes -- payouts of supposed profits ... actuality consisted of other customers' misappropriated funds," the CFTC said in a statement.
The agency further claims that Gelfman staged a computer hack in order to conceal the whole plot.
In the complaint, federal prosecutors say that investors ended up losing "most if not all of their invested funds.
"The Defendants here preyed on customers interested in virtual currency, promising them the opportunity to invest in Bitcoin when in reality they only bought into the Defendants' Ponzi scheme," James McDonald, the CFTC's director of enforcement, said in a statement.
Gelfman did not respond to a request for comment.
The enforcement action comes as China begins a crackdown on bitcoin that shut down two of the country's most prominent bitcoin exchanges.

But, the company also says it has already run into legal challenges from California, Massachusetts and New Jersey -- three states with stringent gun laws.
"Since we have no desire to place any consumer in a situation where they may get arrested and charged with a felony because their state defines a firearm differently than the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), we have placed orders from those states on hold and are refunding customers pending conversations amongst lawyers," said SilencerCo president Jason Schauble.
"It is relevant to point out that no states contemplated a product of this sort in their laws," he said.

"Since its inception, the gun industry has been manufacturing loopholes to get guns and suppressors into as many hands as possible, regardless of how dangerous those hands might be," said Kris Brown, co-president of the Brady Campaign and Center to Prevent Gun Violence. "Literally the only thing workarounds like this accomplish is they make it easier for people we all agree shouldn't have guns, much less sound suppressed ones, to get them."

SilencerCo put the Maxim 50 on the market Tuesday with a $999 price tag. The muzzleloader is sold by a Connecticut company called Traditions firearms, while the silencer is made and attached by SilencerCo in Utah.
Muzzleloaders and silencers are rarely used in crimes, according to a spokesperson for the ATF. Federal gun control laws prohibit felons from possessing firearms. But the lack of federal oversight and the absence of a federal background check means the Maxim 50 could be purchased by a felon, according to the ATF. However, they couldn't necessarily own the ammo for it and certain state and local laws might prohibit possession of the muzzleloader or silencer by convicted criminals depending on how those localities define a "gun" or "firearm."
Silencers are canisters attached to the ends of gun barrels that work like mufflers on a car, and normally they are screwed on instead of being permanently attached. They suppress the noise of a gunshot, rather than silence it completely.
Silencers are subject to federal gun control laws that are more restrictive than for most guns. They are treated like machine guns, requiring a more intensive background check that takes months to process, with a $200 tax.
Related: New pistol with built-in silencer debuts
But muzzleloaders are not subject to federal gun control laws because they use antiquated firing mechanisms without modern ammunition, said Max Kingery, chief of the Firearms and Ammunition Technology Criminal Branch of the ATF. "Thus, there would be no federal restriction on the sale or distribution of this item," he said.
SilencerCo provided CNNMoney with a letter from the ATF that greenlights the Maxim 50, saying that their silencer is not considered a silencer because it's permanently attached to the muzzleloader, which is not considered a gun.
Muzzleloaders are loaded by pouring a measure of gun powder down the barrel along with a bullet, which is packed into place with a ramrod. Modern guns use cartridges in which the bullet, powder and primer are packaged.
It's legal for citizens in 42 states and hunters in 40 states to use silencers, according to the American Suppressor Association. However, gun control advocates see silencers as dangerous weapons that can be exploited by criminals, and they fear the silencers could reduce the noise of shootings and fail to warn people to get away.

The silencer industry touts their benefits for hearing loss prevention. There's currently a bill in Congress called the Hearing Protection Act, which would loosen restrictions on the possession of silencers if it passes.
The industry has been growing in recent years in tandem with gun sales, which were fueled by the political rhetoric of the campaign trail. But sales of guns and silencers dropped after the election of President Trump, a Republican endorsed by the National Rifle Association. Gun owners were no longer afraid of the specter of a Democratic president imposing more restrictive gun control laws.

It spurred the FBI and the Federal Trade Commission to launch investigations. At least 50 class action lawsuits have been filed.
Questions have been raised from many corners about the credit monitoring agency's handling of the breach and its decision to wait more than a month after discovering the hack to alert the public. The company said it discovered the intrusion on July 29.

Among the other issues that have drawn public ire:
--Equifax says the vulnerability at the root of the breach was identified by the company in March. Yet, hackers were able to exploit the flaw months later.
--Three Equifax executives sold off large chunks of stock after the company says it knew about the hack but before it was made public.
--Equifax set up a new website domain to host customer service complaints, and then repeatedly linked to a fake phishing web page on its social media page.
--Equifax initially asked affected customers to give up their right to sue the company in exchange for credit monitoring services.
How the Equifax data breach happened: What we know now
Smith has made a public apology in a letter that appeared in USA Today on September 13, five days after the company told the public about the hack. The CEO said the breach was "the most humbling moment" in Equifax's history and the company is "devoting extraordinary resources to make sure this kind of incident doesn't happen again."
But the message did little to assuage Equifax's critics. The company's stock has plunged 32% so far in September.
Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat and member of the Senate banking panel, said via Twitter she was "outraged" by the breach.
She's also introduced legislation -- alongside fellow Democrat Sen. Brian Schatz -- that would prevent Equifax from charging customers to freeze or unfreeze their credit. (A credit freeze is one of several measures experts recommend affected individuals use to combat potential fraud.)
Smith's appearance before the Senate committee is scheduled one day before he's expected to attend a House committee hearing. The House Energy and Commerce Committee said last week that it sent a formal request to Smith to testify at an October 3 hearing.
Equifax confirmed to CNNMoney on Thursday that Smith will testify at the hearing.
The Senate Banking Committee will also grill Wells Fargo CEO Tim Sloan next month.
The bank is facing separate federal investigations over a scandal that came to light last year: The company created millions of fake accounts for customers in order to boost its sales figures. The country's second largest bank has since been dogged by other controversies, including admitting it charged thousands of customers for car insurance they didn't need.

This year, for the first time, 94% of goods moved tax-free across borders in the Pacific Alliance, a trading bloc that includes Mexico, Colombia, Chile and Peru. Formed in 2011, it accounts for half of all trade in the region and covers about 200 million people.
"We are trading as a group of countries in agreement on free trade," Mexico's foreign minister, Luis Videgaray, said Wednesday evening in New York. Videgaray spoke alongside the presidents of Colombia and Chile, as well as a Peru's trade minister.
Related: NAFTA talks spark deep divide in American agriculture
Videgaray can't say the same about Trump being in agreement on trade. Round 3 of NAFTA negotiations between the U.S., Canada and Mexico, begin Saturday and major issues remain unresolved.
Some see the alliance as a key part of Mexico's backup plan if Trump withdraws from NAFTA.
"The Pacific Alliance is a new frontier that's going to move forward with or without the United States," says Sergio Guzman, an analyst at Control Risks, a global consulting firm. "Countries are seeing the U.S., not just rhetorically but because of NAFTA, as less and less of a dependent partner."
The Pacific Alliance represents a shift for Latin America, a region historically shuttered to global trade. Latin American countries are now going in the opposite direction, eliminating tariffs and opening up economies.
Mexican officials traveled earlier this year to Brazil and Argentina to begin talks on potentially buying more corn and soy -- two products that Mexico buys almost entirely from the United States.
Mexico is also in trade talks with the EU and it has flirted the idea of a free trade agreement with China.
Brazil is leading negotiations with the European Union to strike a deal in principal with the South American trade bloc known as Mercosur.

Argentina, a Mercosur member, knows the dangers of tariffs and protectionism. With trade barriers on almost everything for years, Argentina was once the most expensive place in the world to buy an iPhone.
President Mauricio Macri, who came into office in 2015, ended tariffs on computers, tablets and other electronics this year.
The results: Computer prices in Argentina dropped 30% in July from a year ago and sales shot up 70%, according to Argentina's production minister. Argentina also came out of recession this year.

Michelle Bachelet, Chile's President, threw in a subtle jab at Trump in her closing remarks on Wednesday at an event hosted by the Council on the Americas, a business organization. In January, Trump withdrew from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade deal that hadn't gone into effect but that Chile, Mexico and Peru had agreed to.
Bachelet said TPP isn't dead. Its nations are moving on without Trump.
"It's impossible to think of TPP as it was with the United States," Bachelet said. But, after highlighting upcoming meetings with remaining TPP nations, she added: "What's going to happen to TPP? In other words, a new kind of TPP?...this is a story in progress."


The Republican-controlled banking committee came under pressure to hold another hearing after the disclosure of a string of additional problems at America's second-largest bank.
The first hearing, held last September, was triggered by Wells Fargo's firing of 5,300 workers for creating 2 million fake accounts. Warren unleashed a verbal takedown of former Wells Fargo CEO John Stumpf that instantly went viral.
Since then, Wells Fargo has run into more trouble. The bank has uncovered as many as 1.4 million more fake accounts by digging deeper into its broken culture. Wells Fargo has also admitted to charging thousands of customers for car insurance they didn't need. At least some had their vehicles wrongfully repossessed.
That's not all. Wells Fargo has recently been accused of ripping off mom-and-pop businesses on credit card fees. Some former employees allege Wells Fargo fired them in retaliation for calling the bank's ethics hotline.
Related: Wells Fargo uncovers up to 1.4 million more fake accounts
Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, has held up the scandals as evidence that regulators need to do more to hold the bank -- and all big banks -- accountable. She has begged Federal Reserve chief Janet Yellen to remove much of Wells Fargo's board, alleging these directors were asleep at the wheel during the fake-account disaster.
Yellen on Wednesday reiterated that Wells Fargo's behavior was "egregious and unacceptable." She said the Fed is "working very hard" to understand what went wrong and decide whether more punishments are warranted. (Regulators outside the Fed fined Wells Fargo $185 million last September for the fake-account scandal.)
Wells Fargo hopes to ease the outrage from lawmakers by arguing it's taken meaningful action to fix its internal problems. "We welcome the opportunity to further update the Committee about the progress Wells Fargo has made," the bank said in a statement.
Related: Wells Fargo scandals sabotage Trump's deregulation push
Wells Fargo has in fact done a lot since last fall. Not only was Sloan put in charge, but former Fed official Betsy Duke has been tapped to take over as chairman of the board on January 1. Wells Fargo overhauled the management of its retail bank and clawed back more than $180 million from senior execs. The bank has also revamped the unrealistic sales goals that fueled the unauthorized opening of bank and credit card accounts.
Isaac Boltansky, policy analyst at investment firm Compass Point Research, said Sloan should benefit because he wasn't at the helm during the fake-account scandal. He predicted Sloan will be far better prepared for his grilling than Stumpf was last fall.
"That hearing was a train wreck," Boltansky said.
Critics argue the latest controversies show Wells Fargo hasn't done enough. The Wells Fargo scandals also undercut efforts by President Trump and Republicans to rip up rules they claim are hindering big banks.
Wells Fargo still faces a slew of investigations, including from the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Justice.


But while Wall Street has often viewed rate increases as something to fear, investors aren't sweating the possibility of another boost. That's because rates remain near historically low levels. Any increase is a sign of confidence in the economy by the Fed.
Investors seem to get that.
The Dow & S&P 500 have both gained more than 10% this year while the Nasdaq is up nearly 20%. That's in spite of the fact there are still concerns about what President Donald Trump and Congress will be able to do to help stimulate the economy.
Related: Fed to finally wind down historic rescue program
Simply put, Wall Street thinks that consumers will still spend and corporations will keep hiring even if they don't get help from Washington.
And nobody is too worried about the possibility of Yellen -- or her potential future successor once her term as Fed chair ends next February -- nipping the recovery in the bud by jacking up interest rates too aggressively.
The economy may be in that proverbial Goldilocks spot. It's not growing at too hot a pace to stoke fears of rapid inflation. But it's not so cold that it's causing consumers and businesses to pull back either.
"Future rate hikes will be so slow that investors can prepare for them," said Chris Gaffney, president of EverBank World Markets. "People are okay with gradual tightening. It's good for companies and consumers are more confident."
Gaffney admitted that there are some concerns about the fact that the market still doesn't know who will be leading the Fed a year from now.
"The Fed could be more hawkish next year. And deep down, Yellen is still a dove," Gaffney said, referring to Wall Street's bird metaphors for central bankers. A hawk is someone more likely to raise interest rates while a dove would prefer to keep them low.
Yellen has repeatedly said she will serve out her term as Fed chair but has refused to answer questions about whether she'd agree to stick around for a second term if President Trump asked her to stay.
Jack Flaherty, an investment director at GAM, thinks the market wouldn't bat an eye if Trump reappointed Yellen.
"The job market continues to do well. The unemployment rate should keep going down," he said. "If inflation remains low and people keep getting hired, why would anyone be unhappy with Yellen?"
Related: Is Yellen staying or leaving? Trump's big decision looms
Still, the big question that remains is whether or not the Fed should be boosting rates more aggressively. There is a debate about whether the Fed is being too dismissive of the inflation threat.
Chris Bertelsen, chief investment officer with Aviance Capital Management, says the Fed needs to raise rates more dramatically.
He argues that they should not be still near their 2008 and 2009 crisis era lows given the improvement in the stock market and economy.
That's why he thinks people should be prepared for more rate hikes and should consider buying more conservative investments like Verizon (VZ, Tech30), which pays a dividend that yields nearly 5%, and the First Trust Tactical High Yield (HYLS) bond ETF.
Both have lagged the market this year. Verizon's stock is down about 8% while the high yield bond ETF is up just 1.5%.
But Flaherty isn't too concerned about the Fed being asleep at the wheel. It's not as if inflation is a threat that's being ignored.
"The Fed, like everybody else, is looking for signs of inflation. Is there a chance that the Fed is behind the curve? So far, they haven't been," Flaherty said.


No. It does not provide the same sweeping protections of those with pre-existing conditions as Obamacare.
Here's why:
Prior to Obamacare, many people with pre-existing conditions found themselves branded uninsurable for life on the individual market. Even a bad case of acne as a teen made it hard to get coverage.
Related: GOP offers health care trade-off for states: More flexibility, less funding
Insurance companies routinely turned people with pre-existing conditions away or charged them sky-high premiums. Today, more than a quarter of non-elderly adults have health conditions that would have made them ineligible for coverage in this market, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.
Those with employer policies fared better, but even there, it was possible to get hit. Health care bills were one of the leading causes of bankruptcy.
Related: Here's what would happen to Jimmy Kimmel's son if Graham-Cassidy passes
The Affordable Care Act changed all that. Insurers are no longer allowed to turn people away, nor charge them more, because of a pre-existing condition. Period.
Plus, carriers must offer comprehensive policies that cover a wide array of treatments and medication.
I would not sign Graham-Cassidy if it did not include coverage of pre-existing conditions. It does! A great Bill. Repeal & Replace.

Here's what the latest Obamacare repeal bill would really do:
Just as in Obamacare, insurers could not turn away those with pre-existing conditions. But it would leave it up to the states whether to continue other protections.
States could opt to once again allow carriers to base premiums on a person's medical history and to sell skimpier policies that don't cover Obamacare's 10 essential health benefits. This would apply not only to the individual market, but to those who get coverage from small business employers.
Also, insurers would be able to cap the amount they would pay for treatment outside of what their states deem an essential health benefit.
Related: The one major reason Graham-Cassidy could pass
States must describe how they intend to "maintain access to adequate and affordable health insurance" for those with pre-existing conditions. But most experts say this is a very weak standard and there's no mechanism for ensuring states carry this out. Plus, the health secretary "shall waive" these Obamacare provisions if a state applies to change them, meaning there won't be any review on the federal level.
So those with pre-existing conditions could find themselves unable to afford insurance or to only buy bare bones policies that don't cover the treatments they need.
A wide array of doctor and hospital groups, as well as patient advocacy organizations, have come out against the bill. One of their top concerns: It would hurt people with pre-existing conditions.

The failure of two major lenders in quick succession has raised questions about the health of Russia's banking sector, which has been battered by an economic slowdown and western sanctions.
But signs of a crisis that could spread from bank to bank and cause significant economic damage have not yet appeared, according to William Jackson, an economist at Capital Economics.
"While further problems are likely to emerge in Russia's banking sector, we doubt that these will cause significant damage to the economy," he wrote in a research note.
It's an assessment shared by the central bank.
"The "domino effect" ... can be completely ruled out," deputy bank governor Vasily Posdyshev said, according to state media. "There is no risk here."
Putin and Xi: Two economies, only one to envy
Mikail Shishkhanov, the chief executive of B&N Bank, told Russian media on Thursday that his firm had been held "hostage" by rumors following the rescue of Otkritie Bank.
He tried -- but failed -- to convince investors that their money would be safe in his vaults.
"A week ago ... it became clear that this nervousness was continuing, very unfortunately," he told TV channel RBK.
Russian banks are under pressure because of the deep economic crisis that began in 2014, which was fueled by a double whammy of low oil prices and sanctions.
Official statistics show that 22 million Russians now live below the poverty line, up from 16 million before the crisis.
The slowdown was preceded by a major credit boom. Private debt increased from 50% of GDP in 2005 to almost 90% in 2015, according to the Bank for International Settlements.
"Following the collapse in oil prices and the ruble and the subsequent recession, households and firms have struggled to repay these loans," said Jackson.
Related: Tillerson's Exxon violated Russia sanctions, Treasury says
The official share of bad loans in Russian banks is now 10%, compared with 6% before oil prices collapsed.
But the problem might be even worse than official numbers indicate.
The International Monetary Fund warned Moscow last year that banks may not be giving a full picture of their bad loans. The IMF said the actual ratio of bad loans could be as high as 13.5%.
There's more evidence of pain: The central bank has closed 300 failing lenders -- many of them small -- in recent years.
The Russian economy has since emerged from recession, and the core of its banking system appears to be strong.
The three biggest lenders hold roughly 50% of the country's assets and each is controlled by the state. Otkritie, the largest private lender, accounted for just 3.5% of total bank assets.
Chris Weafer, an analyst at Macro Advisory, said the recent bailouts could encourage some customers to shift their assets to big state banks. It could be a problem if they become too bloated.
Russian state finances remain in relatively good shape.
Moscow runs a small budget deficit, and government debt is relatively low at less than 20% of GDP.

The verbal outburst occurred last weekend after Griffin and her partner called the police to report a noise disturbance on Mezger's property.
KB Home (KBH) revealed on Thursday that its board of directors decided to cut Mezger's 2017 bonus by 25%. It warned him that a similar incident will result in his firing.
"Mr. Mezger's recent behavior in his personal dealings with a neighbor is unacceptable and a negative reflection on KB Home," the directors wrote in a filing.
Related: Trump attacks ESPN after anchor calls him a white supremacist
But KB Home's board, which is responsible for holding its CEO accountable, stopped short of firing Mezger, its chief executive since 2006.
The board said Mezger "has always conducted himself in a professional manner" during his tenure at the company. It also said Mezger has the "full and complete confidence" of the board.
KB Home's board is led by Dorene Dominguez, who serves as its chair. It also includes Melissa Lora, president of Taco Bell, and BET founder Robert Johnson.
Some think the board didn't go far enough.
"Any CEO who goes on that kind of a tirade deserves to be fired," said Sandra Davis, chief executive of MDA Leadership Consulting. She called the 25% bonus cut a "small slap on the wrist."
Davis, who advises companies on management issues, said KB Home's board had an opportunity to show a commitment to inclusion and diversity.
KB Home did not respond to a request for further comment.
In a statement provided to HuffPost, KB Home said Mezger apologized for "losing his temper over a supposed noise complaint involving his three young grandchildren in his swimming pool around 8 p.m. on Saturday, while they were being supervised by their mother and grandmother."
"He apologizes for the language he used," the statement said, "as it does not reflect who he is or what he believes."
Griffin was fired by CNN in May after posting a photo of a bloody head resembling that of President Trump. During the tirade, Mezger alluded to Griffin's firing from CNN, which occurred after she posted the bloody photos resembling Trump. Griffin has apologized for the incident, which Trump said the comedian "should be ashamed of herself" for.
Mezger called Griffin a "bald" anti-gay slur who Trump "kind of put the heat on."


Related: China has a huge debt problem. How bad is it?
Worries about the high levels of debt in the world's second largest economy, particularly among companies, are hardly new. Economists, investors, the International Monetary Fund and even China's central bank chief have been warning about it for years. S&P's announcement adds another high-profile name to the list.
"This won't be news to anyone who has kept half an eye on China over recent years and shouldn't change anyone's thinking," said Mark Williams, chief China economist at Capital Economics. "S&P is playing catch-up."
Chinese authorities have started to crack down on heavy borrowing by companies this year, but S&P says it expects that "credit growth in the next two to three years will remain at levels that will increase financial risks gradually."
The agency cut China's long-term credit rating to A+, its fifth highest level. That brings it into line with the other two major agencies. Moody's lowered China's rating four months ago, and Fitch did it in 2013.
Related: Moody's cuts China debt rating for first time since 1989
The timing of S&P's announcement "is awkward for China's leaders, immediately ahead of next month's Party Congress," Williams said. Beijing responded angrily to Moody's downgrade in May, calling its methodology "inappropriate."
On Friday, the Chinese Finance Ministry called the S&P downgrade the "wrong decision," saying it resulted from a "long-held misunderstanding of China's economy based on the experience of developed countries."
Despite the debt concerns, S&P said it doesn't expect to cut China's rating further anytime soon, predicting the country "will maintain robust economic performance over the next three to four years."

Berry, 78, was having a severe ischemic stroke. Each passing second made brain damage more likely. So, Langston reached for the clot-busting drug Activase, which must be given within a few hours to work.
"If we don't keep this drug [in stock], people will die," Langston said.
Berry survived. But Langston fears others could die because of an unintended bias against rural hospitals built into the U.S. health law. An obscure Obamacare provision forces rural hospitals like Langston's to pay full price for drugs that many bigger hospitals buy at deeply discounted rates.
For example, Langston's 25-bed hospital pays $8,010 for a single dose of Activase — up nearly 200% from $2,708 a decade ago. Yet, just 36 miles down the road, a bigger regional hospital gets an 80% discount on the same drug.
White River Medical Center, a 235-bed facility in Batesville, Ark., buys Activase for about $1,600 per dose. White River participates in a federal drug discount program Congress approved in the early 1990s. The program offers significant price breaks on thousands of drugs to hospitals that primarily serve low-income patients. One federal report found the average discount ranged from 20 to 50 percent, though as illustrated with Activase, it can be much higher.
Rural hospitals have long wanted to be part of the so-called 340B program, too, but were blocked from participating until the Affordable Care Act of 2010. That historic health law added rural hospitals to the overall program. But, unlike bigger hospitals, rural hospitals can't get discounts on expensive drugs that treat rare diseases because of a last-minute exclusion written into the ACA.
Related: Hospitals pay the price when hospitals hire your private practitioner
That seemingly minor detail in the law has left rural hospital pharmacists and health care workers struggling to keep medicines in stock, and wondering if they will be able to adequately care for patients.
Arkansas, for example, is in the "stroke belt," where medical staff depend on Activase to help them battle one of the highest rates of stroke deaths in the country. When Langston went to restock Activase this year, it was so expensive she left a reorder unfilled for more than week, anxiously keeping only one dose of the clot-busting drug on hand.
In Atlantic, Iowa, pharmacy director Crystal Starlin sparingly stocks oncology drugs at Cass County Memorial Hospital. Newly diagnosed cancer patients might have to wait a couple of days to start treatment.
"We just can't keep the extra [drugs] on hand," Starlin said.
In Vermont, North Country Hospital closed its infusion center this spring due to the soaring cost of medicines.
"That was one area we could not afford to be in," said chief executive Claudio Fort.
Congressman Peter Welch, a Democrat from Vermont who represents North Country, said it is clear whom the law hurts and helps.
"The pharma lobbyists pay attention, and their lawyers pay attention to the fine print," Welch said. The pharmaceutical industry "changes that fine print ... [and] many legislators don't even realize [that it] will have this adverse impact on hospitals in their communities."
The rare-disease exclusion means that certain types of hospitals, mostly rural, cannot get discounts on rare-disease drugs, or on drugs that are "designated" to treat a rare disease. (Rare-disease drugs are also known as orphan drugs, which is a federally approved category of drugs that treat a disease affecting fewer than 200,000 people. Often, they carry price tags of up to $100,000 a year or more.)
The Food and Drug Administration gives the designation as a first step when it agrees with a drugmaker's request to study whether a drug can be used to treat a specific rare disease. This can happen even if a drug is already FDA-approved and on the market for use in treating a common condition. The next step — the ability to market the medicine as an orphan drug — comes once research confirms that the drug is safe and effective in treating a specific, less common condition.
The popular clot buster Activase has not won final approval to treat a rare disease but, on two separate occasions in 2003 and 2014, the FDA has given it the orphan designation while research is ongoing.
Related: Women's voices often missing in the health care debate
Thousands of drugs are "designated." The list includes generic drugs such as the hormone melatonin and the autoimmune drug abatacept. In other words, medicines used to treat everything from sleep troubles to arthritis have ended up "designated."
Some drugmakers, such as Janssen Pharmaceuticals, have voluntarily offered discounts to rural hospitals on all of their orphan drugs including Remicade, whether they're approved or designated. In contrast, drugmaker Genentech sent letters to rural hospitals on Jan. 1 listing dozens of drugs that would not qualify for discounts, including Activase and cancer drug Avastin.
Susan Willson, a Genentech spokeswoman, said the company is "deeply committed to ensuring that people have access to the medicines they need." But, she added, the company believes the federal drug discount program has "grown well beyond its original intent."
Several federal reports in recent years from the Medicare advisory board, as well as the Government Accountability Office and the Office of Inspector General, have evaluated the federal drug discount program's growth. About 40% of U.S. hospitals now participate in the program and House Republicans held a hearing this summer questioning the program's growth.
But for Dana Smith, director of pharmacy at Dallas County Medical Center in Fordyce, Ark., the discount program's growth and problems are a separate issue.
"Basically, Genentech is saying to me that rural health care and the patients in rural America are not as important as patients in urban areas," Smith said, adding the pharmaceutical industry "knows we have less manpower to fight them."

America's Health Insurance Plans was even more explicit, saying it cannot support the proposal authored by Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Bill Cassidy of Louisiana.
These two groups join a lengthy list of doctor, hospital and patient advocacy associations that are slamming the bill. Most of them were also opposed to the repeal measure that passed the House in May and the one that failed in the Senate in July.
The legislation would eliminate federal funding for Medicaid expansion and for Obamacare subsidies that lower premiums, deductibles and co-pays in 2020. Instead, states would receive a lump sum of money annually through 2026 that they could use in a variety of ways to lower costs and help consumers pay for coverage.
Related: This map shows why passing Graham-Cassidy could be a huge political problem for Republicans
The bill would also allow states to waive several key Obamacare protections for those with pre-existing conditions. While insurers would still have to provide coverage to everyone, states could let carriers charge enrollees more based on their medical history. The legislation also would eliminate Obamacare's essential health benefits provision, which mandates insurers cover an array of services, including hospitalization, maternity care, prescription drugs, mental health and substance abuse services.
Like its predecessor repeal bills in the House and Senate, the Graham-Cassidy version would repeal the individual and employer mandates. It also would reduce federal support for the overall Medicaid program by sending states a fixed amount per enrollee, known as a per-capita cap, or a lump sum, known as a block grant.

Puerto Rico is already suffering through an epic economic crisis. There's no way it could foot the entire bill itself. In May, it filed for the largest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history.
The government owes $74 billion to bondholders and it hasn't made a payment in over a year. It is trying to work out a payment schedule with an oversight board installed by Congress. This past summer, the island's government and the oversight board bickered over what the board called a lack of progress in a debt payment plan.
The island suffers from severely high unemployment -- more than 10% -- and an exodus of residents who have fled to the mainland U.S. for better job opportunities. Over 400,000 residents have left the island since 2004 -- 89,000 last year alone, according to the Pew Research Center. The current population is about 3.4 million.
There is a ray of hope in the gloom. Some experts say Maria's aftermath is an opportunity for Puerto Rico to rebuild roads, bridges and other infrastructure that desperately needed a makeover.
Plus, the recovery and reconstruction efforts could create much-needed jobs on the island.
"It's almost like wiping the slate clean," says Cate Long, founder of the Puerto Rico Clearinghouse, an independent research firm focused on the island's debts. "All the rebuilding will boost the economy."

The credit report company disclosed earlier this month that it had discovered a giant cybersecurity breach on July 29, compromising the personal information of as many as 143 million Americans -- nearly half the country. Sensitive information like names, social security numbers, birth dates, addresses, and the numbers of some driver's licenses may have been compromised as a result.
She also cautioned of the threat that cyberattacks pose to the financial system.
"We do see [it] as one of the most significant risks to the financial sector," said Yellen.

"A multi-billion dollar corporation is trying to get away with paying its workers $1 per day," Ferguson said in a statement. "That shouldn't happen in America, and I will not tolerate it happening in Washington."
The complaint also alleges GEO Group paid some workers even less by instead compensating them with "snack food such as chicken, potato chips, soda and/or candy."
GEO Group said it "strongly refutes" Ferguson's claims, calling them "baseless" and "meritless allegations."

"We intend to vigorously defend our company against these claims," the company said in a statement.
NWDC is operated by GEO Group via a contract with the federal government.
The facility is tasked with holding people that Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, suspects of being in the country illegally. ICE detainees are kept at such facilities while they await court proceedings.
NWDC, which has the ability to hold more than 1,500 people, is the fourth-largest immigration detention center in the country.
While government-run prisons and detention centers do not have to abide by Washington's $11-per-hour minimum wage law when paying detainees for their work, the attorney general's office says no such exemption exists for private facilities.
GEO Group insists that detained NWDC workers are part of a "volunteer work program," and that the minimum wage "associated with the program is set exclusively by the federal government."
Pablo Paez, GEO Group's vice president of corporate relations, said voluntary work programs at "all immigration facilities" abide by rules set by the federal government, including rules "promulgated under the Obama Administration in 2011."
According to policy documents on ICE's website, participants in voluntary work programs must be paid "at least" $1 per day.

ICE did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The lawsuit demands GEO Group begin paying Washington detainees in accordance with wage laws, and that it fork over the extra profits it earned by allegedly underpaying workers.
NWDC is one of 141 facilities -- including prisons and detention centers -- operated by GEO Group.
Private detention centers and correctional facilities are a highly controversial topic. And this isn't the first criticism lobbed at GEO Group.
The company "has faced a variety of lawsuits, including a class action suit by current and former detainees at a Colorado facility alleging forced labor," Attorney General Ferguson's press release says.
Ferguson's office also said detainees at NWDC have engaged in "multiple hunger strikes" to protest their living conditions.
"As many as 750 detainees reportedly participated in one hunger strike earlier this year," the press release states.


In a statement, GE said the decision was driven by the iconic company's efforts to slash about $2 billion in costs by the end of next year. News of the move was previously reported by The Wall Street Journal.
It underscores the enormous pressure on GE to fix the conglomerate's poor performance. GE is the worst Dow stock this year, off by 23%. That's not a new trend. GE was the worst performer on the Dow during the 16-year tenure of Jeff Immelt, who stepped down as CEO on August 1.

Some of GE's largest shareholders are voicing frustration. Asked at a conference last week about GE's poor performance, Trian Partners Chief Investment Officer Ed Garden said: "We have billions invested. It's not lost on me."
Garden said he's "optimistic" new GE CEO John Flannery will turn things around, but urged management to reduce expenses.
Flannery told employees in a memo on his first day that investors on Wall Street expect him to cut costs and hold people accountable for results. "I heard them loud and clear," Flannery wrote.
It's not clear precisely how much money GE will save from winding down its corporate jet program and selling the planes. GE, which has had a corporate flight department for decades, declined to specify how many jets it owns.
The FAA lists at least a dozen aircraft that are registered to GE, including multiple helicopters and jets made by Gulfstream and Bombardier. GE Aviation owns a Boeing (BA) 747 for testing purposes, but that jet won't be impacted by the new policy.
As CEO, Immelt racked up over $250,000 worth of personal GE aircraft usage last year, according to filings from March. The filings said "for security purposes" GE requires its CEO to use company aircraft for all personal and business air travel. The GE board has updated its policy to allow the CEO to fly on charter and even commercial flights, according to a person familiar with the matter.
GE has sought to remake itself in recent years by narrowing its focus to areas it can lead like health care, wind turbines, jet engines and trains. Along the way, the company has sold off once-prized assets like NBC Universal and GE Capital. GE even announced plans in June to unload its iconic light bulb business.
One thing GE isn't getting rid of: the division that makes jet engines, including some used to fly corporate jets.


This is part of a five year, $50 million initiative of the CVS Health Foundation launched in 2016 to create a tobacco-free generation.

CVS first announced it would no longer sell tobacco products three years ago, and the company's sales and profits took a big hit as a result.


The big problem for General Mills? Wheaties, Cheerios, Lucky Charms and other General Mills brands are no longer a morning staple for many consumers. Cereal sales fell 7% from a year ago in the U.S. during the quarter, according to the company.
But General Mills (GIS) has another thing to worry about. Its yogurt sales are plunging too -- more than 10% in the quarter.
The company blamed weak demand for its Yoplait Greek and Yoplait Light varieties. Sales of its new Oui by Yoplait French style yogurt were not enough to compensate for the sluggish performance of General Mills' other yogurt products.
Related: Grocery stocks are getting clobbered
Changing consumer tastes are clearly hurting General Mills as people opt more for healthy products, and those with fewer genetically modified organisms, or GMOs. But it's not alone. Food companies Kellogg (K) and Conagra (CAG) have struggled as well. Both stocks are down more than 10% in 2017.
One standout in the industry? General Mills' rival Post. That cereal company's shares are up 8% this year and Post (POST) is about to get bigger. It announced earlier this week it was buying breakfast sausage maker Bob Evans Farms (BOBE) for $1.5 billion.
But most packaged food giants are out of favor with Wall Street.
Shares of Oreo maker Mondelez (MDLZ) and the Warren Buffett-backed Kraft Heinz (KHC) are down nearly 10% this year too. And all major food companies are contending with a shakeup in the grocery world.
Walmart (WMT) and Target  (TGT)are focused more on food. That's brought prices down, which has hurt established supermarket chains like Kroger (KR).
And the pressure may only get worse for General Mills and its rivals now that Amazon (AMZN, Tech30) has completed its purchase of Whole Foods. Amazon has already started to lower prices at Whole Foods in an attempt to rid the chain of its Whole Paycheck image.


So the more lawmakers can lower the corporate rate, the more attractive the United States will be as a place for companies to do business.
But there's one thing proponents of this argument don't mention: U.S. competitors impose a consumption tax in addition to their income and social insurance taxes. And that additional source of revenue helps offset the cost of their lower corporate rates.
A consumption tax -- known as a value-added tax (VAT) or a goods and services tax (GST) -- generally ends up raising prices on consumer goods and is rarely popular. But it can bring in a lot of money.
"Other countries can afford lower corporate rates because even a small increase in their VAT rate can pay for a large corporate rate cut," said Martin Sullivan, chief economist at Tax Analysts.
VAT rates among members of the OECD, for example, range from as low as 5% to as high as 27%. The group's average -- 19.2% -- is at a record high. And the mix of revenue in member countries has shifted further toward labor and consumption taxes in recent years, according to the OECD.
Related: Trump says the U.S. is the highest taxed country in the world. It's not.
In the United States, of course, the perpetual stumbling block to any seriously large tax cut is how to pay for the lost revenue that will result.
For example, lowering the corporate rate from 35% today to Trump's preferred 15% would cost about $2 trillion over a decade. Even lowering it to 23% -- which is close to what House Speaker Paul Ryan has said the goal would be -- would still cost $1.2 trillion.
The options to pay for the rate cut include eliminating business tax breaks and praying for outsized economic growth. Another option is to simply not pay for some or all of the potential revenue loss, instead adding it to the cost of the nation's already large and growing debt.
Other countries with a consumption tax have more choices. Yes, they may choose to curb tax breaks to pay for a business rate cut. But they also have the option of bumping up their VAT or GST to help make up for the revenue loss.
In recent years, for example, the United Kingdom and Japan increased their VAT rates around the same time they cut their corporate rates.
And if a corporate rate cut delivers some of the economic growth advocates promise, that in turn can boost revenue from a VAT even if the rate on the VAT stays the same.
But to date there has been little appetite for a consumption tax in the United States. "Our national VAT-phobia precludes this possibility in the U.S.," Sullivan said.
Just this summer, a House Republican proposal for a border adjustment tax, which is similar to a partial VAT, was shot down in large part because critics warned it would raise prices on imported consumer goods.


Buffett, whose fortune Forbes pegs at $78 billion, realizes he won't be around to see if his Dow prediction comes true. The 87-year-old billionaire said he gets "excited" just when people talk about him making it to 100.
So is Buffett's Dow 1 million call just crazy talk? Maybe not.
Keep in mind that the Dow was sitting at just 81 a century ago. It's now valued at nearly 300 times that level, as the U.S. has developed into the world's most powerful economy and its only superpower.
To get to 1 million, the Dow would have to skyrocket 4,500% from here. But it would have 100 years to get there. The compound annual return would only need to be 3.87%. That sounds doable considering that the Dow sported a 10.7% rate of return between the end of 2008 and last year.
"That is not a ridiculous forecast at all, if you do the math on it," Buffett said. "It's an amazing country we live in."

Of course, a lot could go wrong along the way. Some worry about the threat of a conflict with North Korea, while others are concerned about trade wars and the rise of populism.
Mike Bloomberg, the billionaire former mayor of New York City, worries the economy faces real challenges from crumbling infrastructure, job-destroying technology and difficult immigration policies. "I cannot for the life of me understand why the market keeps going up," Bloomberg told CBS on Tuesday.
What's certain is that at some point, the bull market in stocks, already the 2nd most powerful in history, will end.
Skeptics fear that end will be very painful, because stocks have been pumped up to enormous heights by extraordinary stimulus from the Federal Reserve. Julian Robertson, another billionaire investor, warned last week that the Fed is "creating a bubble" in stocks by being slow to raise interest rates from emergency levels leftover from the 2008 financial meltdown.

Buffett, on the other hand, has a long history of being optimistic on America, even when things look bleak. Recall the $5 billion lifeline he provided to Goldman Sachs (GS) during the financial crisis. That bet represented a vote of confidence in Goldman at a time of great fear. And its generous terms eventually made Buffett billions.
Savvy investments like that are why Buffett ranks No. 2 on the Forbes list of the richest people in the U.S. Buffett noted that over the years, about 1,500 different people have made the Forbes list of richest Americans. Some are entrepreneurs, others made their money in real estate or the stock market.
"But the one thing you don't see in those 1,500 names: you don't see any short sellers," Buffett said.


One of its investments will include an entertainment complex set to launch by 2019, the official Saudi Press Agency said on Wednesday.
There are currently very few entertainment attractions in the conservative society. Public cinemas and theaters are banned. The kingdom hosted its first music concert this year, but only men were allowed to attend.
With oil prices depressed, Saudi Arabia is trying to diversify its economy to end its dependence on energy exports.
Last year, it launched Vision 2030, a blueprint for what the economy should look like in the next decade. One of its key goals is to grow the tourism and entertainment sector.

The new company should drive that.
"By the end of 2030, the company's projects aim to serve more than 50 million visitors annually and create more than 22,000 jobs in the Kingdom, which will contribute around 8 billion Saudi Riyals ($2 billion) to the GDP," the agency said.
Many Saudis visit neighboring countries for vacations and public holidays. About a million Saudis visited Dubai alone in 2017, and officials would rather they spend more of their holiday money in the domestic economy.
Vision 2030 aims to double the share of household spending that goes on Saudi entertainment to 6% by 2030.
In April, the Kingdom announced the launch of a 334 square kilometer (129 square miles) city, dedicated to sports, culture and entertainment.
The first phase of the project, located south west of the capital Riyadh, will open by 2022 and include a Six Flags (SIX) theme park as one of the main attractions.

But Walmart's move is a sign of the tightening labor market which has made it difficult for employers to fill open positions. There were a record number of unfilled job openings nationwide in the latest government reading of the labor market. More than 600,000 of the open positions were from retail.
It also can be seen as part of the effort by Walmart, the nation's largest private sector employer, to make jobs there more attractive and to cutdown on turnover.
The company announced a series of pay raises for its lowest paid employees in early 2015, which took the minimum pay for most employees to $10 an hour by last year, and the average pay for its full-time workers to about $13 an hour. Part-time workers are paid about $10 an hour on average.
For part-time employees, additional hours could increase total pay more than an increase in hourly pay.

Walmart says it employed the same strategy of more hours for existing employees during the holidays last year and "we heard great feedback from our customers and associates," according to Judith McKenna, chief operating officer of Walmart U.S.

Puerto Rico's government owes $74 billion to bondholders, and an additional $50 billion in pension obligations to teachers and almost all other government employees. In May, it filed for the largest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history.
Meanwhile, Puerto Rico faces another long-term problem: Many residents are moving from the island for the mainland United States, leaving it with few skilled workers to handle the rebuilding and development process.
The territory's population was down to 3.4 million residents last year from 3.8 million in 2004. Persistently high unemployment, along with better job opportunities in the mainland U.S., have pushed Puerto Ricans to pick up their bags and move, mainly to Florida and Texas, according to the Pew Research Center.
Related: How to rebuild an island after Hurricane Irma
The pace is picking up, too. In 2005, nearly 47,000 Puerto Ricans left the U.S. territory for the mainland. Last year: 89,000 left, Pew reports. Puerto Rico's economy has been in a recession since 2006. It's unemployment rate in August was 10.1%, more than double the national average, according to Labor Department figures.
Puerto Rico's government has tried to lure investors and businesses to the island to boost its tax base. It offers major tax incentives to wealthy individuals who own property or start a business on the island. Its current administration is trying to cut red tape to make it easier for investors to buy Puerto Rican debt with fewer hurdles. It also agreed to be subject to a financial oversight board to help ensure it starts to pay down its debts.
However, the oversight board has criticized Rossello's administration this year for its lack of progress on creating a sustainable debt-payment plan. Rossello argues that the criticisms are unfair and that the island's government is making progress.
Puerto Rico was spared a direct hit by Hurricane Irma, though hundreds of thousands of people lost power and some structures were badly damaged, officials said.

Here's a look at inequality by the numbers:
Income for the rich up 27%
Germany's economy grew by 22% between 1991 and 2014, helping to fuel income growth of 12%.
But the benefits have not been shared equally.
The richest 10% of households saw their real incomes jump by 27% between 1991 and 2014, according to the German Institute for Economic Research. Middle class incomes increased by 9% over the same period, while households at the bottom saw their incomes drop by 8%.
Wages paid to workers increased by 5% between 2000 and 2016. Meanwhile, income from investments and business activities jumped by 30%.
Related: Germany's hidden hunger
Markus Grabka, an economist with the German Institute for Economic Research, said that weaker labor unions, tax reforms that benefited the rich and an increase in single person households have contributed to inequality.
Outsourcing and automation have made the situation even worse.
10% own 60% of the wealth
The income gap has translated into major differences in wealth.
The richest 10% the population owns 60% of assets, while the bottom 40% have almost nothing, according to Germany's central bank.
Inequality has risen steadily since 2005 despite unemployment dropping to record lows, according to Grabka.
Grabka said the big question is whether all households "benefit from the strong recovery of the German economy."
Huge efforts have been made to develop the poorer East since it was reunited with West Germany.
But the risk of slipping into poverty is still significantly higher today in former Communist territory, where many industry towns have experienced a steady decline.
"A large share of companies were closed in East Germany and the post-reunification construction boom [ran out in the 1990s]," said Oliver Rakau, chief Germany economist at Oxford Economics.
Related: How German economy stacks up
16%: The risk of falling into poverty
The share of Germans at risk of falling into poverty has jumped from 11% two decades ago to 16% in 2014.
Grabka said that another key factor is an increasing number of jobs that don't pay well.
Nearly 7 million Germans are working part time, precarious "mini jobs" that pay up to €450 ($540) a month. Many rely on welfare payments to get by.

Germany introduced a national minimum wage in 2015 in hopes of tackling the problem, an initiative supported by Merkel.
But the chancellor, whose slogan is "prosperity and security for all," has been largely silent on the issue of inequality during the current campaign.
Her main challenger, Martin Schulz, has paid more attention to the issue, arguing that Germany is a successful exporter because wages are kept low.


The revived effort to dismantle Obamacare, authored by Senators Lindsey Graham and Bill Cassidy, would give states a lot more flexibility over how to provide health care for their residents. Instead of the rigid federal regulations in the Affordable Care Act, states could use their money to provide subsidies to offset premiums or out-of-pocket costs, for instance. Or they could set up high-risk pools or shield insurers from pricey enrollees through reinsurance programs. They could even send payments directly to doctors and hospitals to lower the cost of care.
"Obamacare took power away from patients and states and gave it to the federal government. This returns that power to where it belongs," the bill's authors wrote in an explainer. "Each individual state is a laboratory of democracy, allowed to innovate to find solutions."
Related: What's in the latest Obamacare repeal bill?
But there's a catch. The flow of federal dollars for Medicaid and Obamacare subsidies would shrink in nearly all states, particularly in those that expanded Medicaid to low-income adults.
The bill would eliminate funding for Medicaid expansion and the subsidies that help many enrollees afford premiums, deductibles and co-pays. Instead, states would receive a lump sum of money as a block grant to help residents pay for health care through 2026. After that, it would be up to Congress to appropriate the funds annually.
Related: It's all coming down to Lisa Murkowski -- again
Also, it would radically overhaul the traditional Medicaid program, which insures roughly one in five Americans. The bill would send a fixed amount of money to the states each year and reduce the growth rate of that funding.
The two provisions combined would likely curtail federal support for health care -- the biggest injection of federal funds into state budgets -- throughout most of the country. In response, these states would probably have to cut enrollment, pare back benefits or reduce provider payments.
The Congressional Budget Office has yet to put a figure on just how big a cut it would mean. But its analysis of an earlier Senate repeal bill showed that a similar restructuring of the traditional Medicaid program and the gradual winding down of Medicaid expansion would reduce federal spending by $772 billion by 2026, compared to current law. Also, the earlier bill would have left about 15 million fewer people insured under Medicaid at that time.
What turning federal funding of Medicaid expansion and Obamacare subsidies into a block grant would mean is less clear. There would be some winners (think Republican states that didn't expand Medicaid) and lots of losers (a mix of blue and red states that did).
Related: Senators ditch bipartisan health care talks
An initial estimate from Fitch Ratings released last week found that the block grant overall would be $20 billion, or 14% less, in 2020 -- the first year of implementation -- than states would receive in Medicaid expansion and subsidy funding under Obamacare. But the formula would also shift federal support from states that expanded Medicaid to those that didn't in an attempt to even it all out.
By 2026, 20 states would face funding cuts from 35% to 60% below what they would have received from Medicaid expansion and Obamacare subsidy funding under current law, according to the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. These include California, New York, Massachusetts, Louisiana, Alaska and Kentucky.
Overhauling the rest of Medicaid would slice $39 billion, or 8%, of funding by 2026, relative to current law, the center estimates. Those cuts would get bigger over time since the annual funding increases would be tied to a lower inflation rate.
The two provisions combined would lead to 35 states losing Medicaid and subsidy funding by 2026, the center found. California and New York would be the big losers, while Texas and Alabama would see gains.
Related: Trump, White House go all-out for Graham-Cassidy Obamacare repeal bill
Implementing spending caps for both provisions shifts the burden and risks away from the federal government and onto the states, according to Fitch Ratings. States would be forced to adjust their budgets, putting pressure on state support of local governments, public colleges and health care providers.
"In the short-term, non-expansion states may see gains under the bill given redistribution of ACA-related spending streams," Fitch wrote in an analysis. "But, over time even non-expansion states will face budgetary challenges given the proposed changes to Medicaid, which will likely accelerate for all states over time."


Starting in October, the Fed will begin unloading $10 billion of debt from its so-called balance sheet, including $6 billion in Treasury securities and $4 billion in agency debt each month through December.
For years, the central bank piled up purchases of Treasury and mortgage-backed securities, a strategy intended to stimulate the economy by reducing borrowing costs for everyone. At the time, it also reduced its benchmark interest rate to zero, and only began raising it in December 2015, seven year after the crisis.
On Wednesday, the Fed left rates unchanged, hovering between 1% and 1.25%.
Related: The CNNMoney Trump Jobs Tracker
The central bank has raised that rate three times since December as the economy has gradually improved. Raising rates too quickly could risk hobbling the recovery.
Still, the majority of Fed policymakers signaled on Wednesday that they expect to lift rates one more time this year.
Central bankers pointed to signs of strength in the U.S. economy, including a pickup in household spending and growth in business investments, in a statement following the Federal Open Market Committee's two-day meeting.
"Job gains have remained solid in recent months, and the unemployment rate has stayed low," the Fed said in a statement.
While Fed officials cautioned that the devastation of Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria would hold back the U.S. economy in the "near term," they said the storms would not "materially alter" the country's economy overall.
"Within a few months, rebuilding activity has typically kicked in, returning economic growth to normal—or maybe even a little higher than normal," wrote Eric Winograd, AB senior economist in a note. "So, despite the storms, we're still confident the U.S. economy will keep its momentum, because the foundations are sound."

Some Fed officials have warned against raising interest rates until inflation -- which reflects the prices of everything from meat and cheese to houses and cars -- meets the goal of 2% that they consider healthy for the economy.
But inflation is still running below that target, even though the job market has picked up and other explanations have fallen away. In a press conference, Fed chair Janet Yellen described it as something of a "mystery."
In past years, she said the Fed has been able to point to root causes of low inflation: the gap between those employed versus those that aren't, energy prices and a rising dollar.
"This year's inflation shortfall is more of a mystery," Yellen told reporters at the press conference. "I will not say that the committee clearly understands what the causes are."
Central bankers have been in a bind over when to lift rates again. Inflation has been stubbornly low for years, suggesting the Fed should hold off. But economic growth and low unemployment suggest they should act.
Fed officials cautioned that they do expect inflation to be higher than normal -- at least for a little while -- following the hurricanes that have devastated Texas, Florida and now Puerto Rico.
"Inflation remains the wild card of Fed policy and the temporary boost to gasoline prices following the hurricanes only clouds the picture further," said Bankrate.com's chief financial analyst Greg McBride. "Whether the Fed hikes in December will remain an open question until December."
Along with one more rate hike this year, the Fed also predicted three more possible moves next year.
"It is too soon for the committee to conclude that the recent slowing in inflation was sufficiently permanent to alter the Fed's plans," Michael Gapen, a Barclay's analyst wrote in a research note.
The Fed said it continues to expect inflation to remain at 1.6%, below its target, and the unemployment rate to be 4.3%, based on its updated economic projections.
The central bank did, however, offer a rosier picture of the overall economy, upping its economic growth forecast to 2.4% from 2.2%.
Yellen again declined to address speculation about whether President Trump will nominate her for a second four-year term leading the Fed. Her first term ends in February.

The cuts would be distributed "roughly evenly" between both companies, he said.
In an interview with CNN, Thyssenkrupp chief financial officer Guido Kerkhoff said the main goal of the merger was to "cope with the overcapacity issues in Europe" -- a situation made worse by Chinese exports.
Chinese overcapacity still outstrips total demand in Europe and the United States, Kerkhoff added.
Industry experts say the merger has been a long time coming.
"The market has strongly suspected this amalgamation was coming for some time now -- it is the worst kept secret in steel," said Alex Griffiths, an analyst at consulting firm Wood Mackenzie.
"Regardless of cost savings resulting from the joint venture, neither entity is likely to add further capacity," he added.

The companies said they plan to sign a formal agreement early next year and close the deal by the end of 2018.
Tata Steel, a subsidiary of one of India's biggest industrial groups, has faced numerous challenges with its European steel business.
The company announced plans to offload its U.K. operations last year, blaming cheap Chinese steel imports for plummeting prices. But it later put those plans on hold.

Across the board, stores are closing at an alarming rate as shoppers lose interest in brick-and-mortar locations. And as bad as things are now, Wall Street thinks things are only going to get worse.
According to analysis by Bespoke Investment Group, investors are more pessimistic about the retail industry now than they have been since September 2008.
But Bed Bath & Beyond may also be facing tougher competition from traditional rivals. Williams-Sonoma (WSM), which also owns Pottery Barn and West Elm, reported earnings last month that topped forecasts.


Related: Trump is still hurting gun sales
Until now, Trump has been bad news for the gun industry, even though he is a Republican endorsed by the National Rifle Association. In August, Sturm Ruger said gun sales fell by 21% in the second quarter of 2017 and that its profit was cut in half.
Gun makers actually fared much better under President Barack Obama.
Buyers who feared that the Obama administration would tighten regulations stockpiled guns during his tenure, and they continued shopping when it seemed Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton might win the presidency.
Once Trump was elected, consumers felt confident that regulations would not tighten, and gun purchases fell.
American Outdoor Brands said that gun sales last quarter dropped by half from a year ago. Over the past year, its stock has plunged by nearly 44%.

That's especially pressing because both teams will move to a futuristic $2.6 billion stadium in 2020.
"Anyone who expected instant sellouts with crazy, maniacal fans with painted faces from Day 1 should have been in minority," a sports television veteran told CNNMoney. "That kind of fandom takes time to build. Winning helps. Changing habits doesn't happen overnight."
The teams say ticket sales are just fine.
The Rams, who moved from St. Louis before last season, are playing in the L.A. Coliseum, which holds over 90,000 fans. It's also home to the University of Southern California Trojans -- whose fans regularly fill the place on Saturdays in the fall.
The Rams drew an average of 80,000 last year, partly because of excitement over the team's arrival. The team, expecting a drop-off for the second year, says it intentionally capped tickets at 65,000 this season to improve the fan experience.

The Chargers, who moved from San Diego for this season, are at the StubHub Center, a complex that holds 27,000 and is also home to the LA Galaxy of Major League Soccer.
The Chargers sold out their season tickets, which were on average the most expensive in the league. They reported attendance of more than 25,000 for Sunday's game. The team provides more than 1,000 tickets for sponsors and players' families, and it doesn't count those toward attendance.
Related: The NFL is back. Are you?
For all the concern over empty seats, ticket sales aren't a major source of revenue for the league. The real money lies in broadcast and streaming rights, and those deals -- billions of dollars in all -- are locked in for the immediate future.
Plus, when the two teams moved to Los Angeles their valuations increased dramatically -- it pays to play in the second largest U.S. market.
Still, two weeks into the season, the NFL has had to address the issue of L.A.'s suitability.
On Monday, league spokesman Joe Lockhart told reporters on a conference call that the teams' owners "knew going in that this wasn't a one-game or a one-year solution where they could just turn the light on and expect the kind of support that they are very confident they are going to get as they move towards the opening of their new stadium."
Team ownership also acknowledges that it's important to get out into the community to build their brands and create fans in L.A. The city has been home to NFL teams in the past, but hasn't had one for more than 20 years.
The Cleveland Rams first moved to L.A. in 1946. The relocation changed the face of the league because, to secure a lease for the L.A. Coliseum, the Rams agreed to integrate. That prompted the NFL to lift an informal ban on black players in place since 1933.
The Los Angeles Chargers franchise was born in 1960, but moved to San Diego after just one season. In 1982, the Oakland Raiders moved to L.A., giving the city two teams. But by 1995, the Rams and the Raiders were both out of the city.
Related: Meet the first woman to call an NFL game in 30 years
Lockhart said the league is confident that support for both teams will grow once the new stadium, which will be privately funded, opens. (Because of record rainfall in Southern California, the opening got pushed back a year from 2019.)
A shiny new home should build support for the teams, and the new place will be easier to get to than either of the current stadiums.
"There are more than 20 million people that live within an easy drive of the new Inglewood stadium," a league source told CNNMoney. "With three seasons to build up the fan base, both teams should do at least OK in Inglewood. And if one of the teams is good and exciting and in the playoff hunt, that team will do very well."
The Rams are responsible for financing the new stadium, according to a league source in L.A. The team plans to sell personal seat licenses -- expensive one-time fees that allow the buyer to reserve a seat or transfer or sell the rights to someone else.
The Rams are reportedly considering selling PSLs in the $100,000 range. If they can't raise the money, they could have a problem financing the stadium.
The Chargers haven't committed yet but are also thinking about selling PSLs, according to the source.
Ultimately, the success of the teams in L.A. depends on whether they're able to sell themselves to fans and generate interest. One of the best ways to do that is to be good. So far, the Rams are 1-1 and the Chargers are 0-2.
"These teams need to win, and win in an exciting fashion," the source said. "If you don't put a compelling product forth for L.A. fans, you're going to lag badly."
--Correction: An earlier version of this story gave an incorrect number for the ticket cap set by the Rams. It is 65,000, not 56,000.


NPD sports industry analyst Matt Powell said in a tweet that "this is an achievement I never thought I would see in my lifetime." (Me either. I remember buying a pair of red, white and black Sky Jordans as a kid at my neighborhood JCPenney in 1985!)
But Jordan, now an owner of the NBA's Charlotte Hornets, doesn't seem to have the same marketing appeal he did back when he was a player winning slam dunk titles and six championships with the Chicago Bulls.
Foot Locker (FL) CEO Richard Johnson warned during its last quarterly earnings conference call that sales of some of Nike's Jordan footwear and clothing "slowed considerably" in the quarter.
Weak shoe sales are hurting Foot Locker, and its rivals Finish Line (FINL) and Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) as well. All three stocks are down about 50% this year.
Strong sales from Adidas aren't just bad news for Nike. Under Armour (UAA) is hurting too. Not even a second NBA title for Golden State Warriors star and UA endorser Steph Curry has been enough to lift sales of his shoes, which have been criticized for not being very fashionable.
Related: Air ball! Nobody's buying expensive sneakers from Nike and Under Armour
Even Curry's teammate Kevin Durant, who endorses Nike, recently said in a podcast with Bill Simmons that "nobody wants to play in Under Armours."
Wall Street is clearly nervous too. Shares of Under Armour have plunged more than 40% so far in 2017. That follows a 30% drop last year. Nike's stock is up 6% this year, but it was down nearly 20% in 2016. That made it the Dow's worst performer last year.
But the problems plaguing Nike and Under Armour and the retailers that sell their shoes are not hurting Adidas at all.
The German-based company said last month that sales for the second quarter rose nearly 20%. Adidas also said that revenue and profits for the full year would be better than expected. Adidas investors are happy too. The stock is up 50% this year.
Adidas is benefiting from its deal with Harden, but it is also being helped by having two larger-than-life celebrities -- Kanye West and his half-sister-in-law Kendall Jenner -- endorsing Adidas shoes as well.
If this trend keeps up, Adidas might even be able to convince Los Angeles Lakers rookie Lonzo Ball (and his dad LaVar) to ditch their own Big Baller Brand of shoes and start wearing Adidas -- especially if Adidas offers the Balls some lucrative stock options.


2. Does Yellen even want to stay on for a second term?
Related: Fed Vice Chair stepping down in October
Her four-year term expires in February, and Trump has both criticized and complimented her. Traditionally, a president makes a nomination for Fed Chair in the fall in order for the Senate to hold confirmation hearings.
Experts aren't convinced Trump will nominate Yellen. But they are more confident that Yellen, who has spent much of her career at the Fed, would accept a second term.
"I think there's about a one-in-three chance she stays." says David Wessel, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. "I think if the president asked her to stay on, she would say yes."
Related: Ivanka Trump had breakfast with Janet Yellen
Trump finds himself in a unique position to leave a lasting mark on the world's most powerful central bank. Fed governors serve 14-year terms and Trump has come into office when several are leaving or their terms are expiring. In addition to deciding whether to renominate Yellen,Trump can nominate four of the seven other members of the Board of Governors based in Washington.
"This is a really big deal," says Gus Faucher, senior economist at PNC Financial. "This is a huge opportunity for the president to put his stamp on what he wants monetary policy to be."
Because Trump likes to make his mark, Faucher argues that Trump is unlikely to renominate Yellen.
Yellen and Trump diverge on a key area: financial reform. Yellen staunchly defends the reforms enacted after the financial crisis in 2008. Trump wants to tear them up as a part of a broader rollback on federal regulations.
Related: 3 things to watch at the Fed's September meeting
Trump looked poised to nominate one of his top economic advisers, Gary Cohn, as the new Fed chair. But they had a falling out over Trump's response to a white supremacist protest in Charlottesville, Virginia and Cohn is no longer seen as a top contender.
Other names being floated: Glenn Hubbard, dean of Columbia University's business school; John Taylor, a professor at Stanford University; Kevin Warsh, a former Fed governor; and Neel Kashkari, the president of the Minneapolis Fed who Wessel describes as a "dark horse."
But one of Yellen's friends and former colleagues at the University of California, Berkeley, doubts Trump is giving the nomination much thought. He says Trump could change his mind on a new Fed Chair based on the day's news.
"I'm not sure he has any coherent thoughts on the matter," says Andrew Rose, an economics professor at Berkeley. "Even if he had any coherent thoughts on the matter, he might change them in the next 45 minutes."
If Trump doesn't give Yellen another chance, her legacy is already cemented, Rose says.
"She'll be viewed very successfully," Rose argues. But undoubtedly, he adds: "She will retire and be very, very happy."


This is the sixth year of relatively modest increases in job-based premiums. The bump in rates was similar to the increase in workers' wages, which rose 2.3%, and inflation, which ticked up 2%.
The cost of health insurance has come into the spotlight in recent years, with Obamacare revealing just how pricey coverage can be. Premiums for the benchmark silver plan on the individual market soared 22% this year for those who don't qualify for federal subsidies. The average silver plan for a 40-year-old cost $4,929, according to Health Pocket, an online health insurance shopping tool.
(Those who do get government assistance pay no more than 10% of their household income towards premiums. The majority of people on the exchanges and half of those in the individual market qualify for premium subsidies.)
"While the marketplaces seem to get all the attention, the much larger employer market where more than 150 million people get their coverage is very stable," said Drew Altman, CEO of the Kaiser Family Foundation.
Employer policies, which cover just over half of non-elderly Americans, have long been considered the gold standard of coverage. Companies take care of the lion's share of the cost.
However, this market has not been immune to soaring health care prices.
Workers covering their families are shouldering a larger share of the premiums than they had in the past. Their premiums rose 32% from 2012, compared to only 14% for employers, Kaiser found.
One reason why workers are paying more for family coverage is because companies often subsidize a smaller slice of their dependents' premiums. This is especially true among firms with fewer than 200 staffers.
Related: Three things Congress could do to quickly stabilize Obamacare
Also, companies have been hiking deductibles.
The average deductible for workers with single coverage was $1,505. While that is roughly the same as last year, it is more than double what it was a decade ago.
Kaiser doesn't track deductibles for families, which are more variable by employer.

Just over half of workers with single coverage face deductibles of at least $1,000 this year, up from about one-third in 2012. And 11% have deductibles of at least $3,000, up from 6% in 2012.
Some 19% of employees are in high-deductible plans with health savings accounts now, up from 6% in 2010. Their annual deductibles are at least $1,300 for single coverage and $2,600 for family plans.
Related: When high deductibles cause even insured patients to postpone care
Workers are also on the hook for more when they get medical care. The share of workers responsible for at least $3,000 in out-of-pocket costs -- which include deductibles and co-pays -- jumped to 57% this year, up from 38% in 2013.
One bright spot, however, is that more companies are placing a limit on how much employees are responsible for. That's because Obamacare instituted a cap on Americans' out-of-pocket expenses -- $7,150 for 2017.


That's not true.
The U.S. has added an average of 176,000 new jobs a month so far this year. Last year the U.S. economy added an average of 194,000 jobs a month in the same period, between January and August. The full-year average for 2016 was also above 2017's pace at 187,000 jobs a month, according to Labor Department data.
Trump began his remarks on Tuesday by citing the economy's progress since November when he won the election. But the pace of job growth since last November, averaging 172,000 new jobs, is still lower than in 2016.
Related: U.S. adds 156,000 new jobs in August
And it wasn't just last year that was better. In 2015, job growth averaged 226,000 a month. In 2014 it was 250,000 jobs a month.
A few of Trump's other claims were on the mark. He was correct when he told the UN that the stock market is at an all-time high -- the Dow and S&P 500 continue to hover around or reach all-time highs these days. He also said unemployment is at its lowest level in 16 years, and the current rate of 4.4%, is indeed nearly the lowest in 16 years. Finally, he said there are more people working in the United States than ever before. Given the size of the labor force and the number of Americans who have jobs, that's generally accurate.
Some companies may be moving jobs to the United States, but job growth simply isn't the best it's been "in a very long time." The White House did not respond to a request for comment.


The latest partnership between Kohl's (KSS) and Amazon (AMZN, Tech30) comes as traditional retailers try (and often fail) to adapt to a rapidly changing landscape. Toys 'R' Us filed for bankruptcy protection late Monday.
Toys 'R' Us has been hurt by Amazon, as well as Walmart (WMT) and Target (TGT). But other retailers are following the lead of Kohl's and have decided to work more closely with Amazon to boost sales.
Sears (SHLD), which also owns Kmart, has been one of the worst-performing retailers of the past decade. But the company announced in July that it would sell Kenmore appliances, including some that are compatible with Alexa, on Amazon.
Related: Wall Street bets Amazon will doom department stores
Cooper Smith, director of Amazon research at L2, a firm that tracks the digital performance of brands, says he expects more retailers to partner with Amazon -- but they will need to be wary at the same time.
"Doing deals with Amazon makes sense. They can help get consumers to come back, especially around Black Friday," he said. "But these retailers will have to tread a careful line when partnering with Amazon."
That's because Amazon isn't just working with other retailers. The company has opened its own physical stores, Amazon Books, that sells best-selling books and Amazon devices.
And in its biggest brick-and-mortar move of all, Amazon bought Whole Foods this year for nearly $14 billion. The deal recently closed, and now you can buy Amazon gadgets at the grocery store along with kale and quinoa.
It should come as no surprise, then, that investors in Barnes & Noble (BKS) and Kroger (KR) aren't too pleased with Amazon's increased clout in the real world. The stocks of both companies have plunged nearly 40% this year, while Amazon is up 30%.
L2's Smith notes that Amazon has its sights set on clothing, too. That could pose a problem for Kohl's and Sears.
"Amazon is launching private label apparel brands of its own," Smith said, adding that this could hurt sales of bargain-priced fashion at Kohl's, Sears and other department stores.
Related: Nordstrom may reinvent itself
Not every big traditional retailer is throwing in the towel.
Chuck Grom, an analyst with Gordon Haskett, notes that Macy's (M) recently hired Hal Lawton, formerly a senior executive at eBay (EBAY), to be its president. Nordstrom (JWN) is launching a format called Nordstrom Local with no inventory. The Local stores will have stylists who help people pick out clothes that they can order online. The stores will serve wine and beer, too.
"We continue to observe more and more collaboration between digitally native companies and traditional retailers -- a theme that we think will continue to build momentum in the coming quarters," Grom wrote in a report Tuesday.
And Walmart continues to boost its own digital operations under the leadership of Marc Lore, who joined the retailer after Walmart bought his company Jet.com last year.
"Walmart has done an extremely great job online under Lore," Smith said. "It's shaping up to be an all-out price war between Walmart and Amazon, and if anyone can beat Amazon at its own game, it's Walmart."


"Our queso is made with only real ingredients, which makes it different. We like that difference, but it is different," Chipotle (CMG) responded to one unhappy customer.
Some analysts aren't buying that.
Goldman Sachs said initial reactions to the new dip "suggest few customers will become repeat consumers."
"A very negative reaction to the queso launch suggests Chipotle launched a product that is not meeting consumer expectations, and, as a result, missed a potentially significant opportunity to add queso as an incremental add-on," Goldman Sachs analysts wrote in a research note Monday.
Chiptole stock slipped 3.6% on Monday and was among the biggest losers on the S&P 500 index. It fell again Tuesday, dropping by 1.5%.

And it had high hopes for queso. Back in July the company described the dip as the cornerstone of its effort to "change the narrative and encourage our guests" to keep coming back.
Goldman Sachs said the negative response mirrored the reaction from consumers in trials, and suggested Chipotle had "rushed" to market with the new product.


For the second quarter in a row, the Business Roundtable CEO Economic Outlook Index hit its highest level since 2014.
"The survey results demonstrate that CEOs remain confident in the U.S. economy and that we must seize on the opportunity to continue to press for pro-growth economic policies that create jobs and fuel wage growth at all levels of the economy," Jamie Dimon, chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase and chairman of the Business Roundtable, said in a statement.

The index, a composite of more than 200 chief executives' plans over the next six months, edged higher for the third quarter, demonstrating continued confidence in the economy by CEOs.
Hiring plans jumped to the highest reading in more than six years.
Plans for capital investment stayed about the same but have been edging higher, meaning CEOs are confident enough in the economy to spend money to improve their businesses.
Expectations for sales fell, but Joshua Bolten, president and CEO of the Business Roundtable, told reporters that's probably because of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma.

But the chief executives say Washington needs to reach a deal on tax reform to bolster the economy.
The Trump administration and Republicans in Congress are working on plans for tax reform, which they say would include tax cuts for businesses and the middle class. But whether such a plan will pass, when it will pass, and what it will include remain open questions.
CEOs "will hire less and they will invest less than they currently have on the books if tax reform doesn't come through," Bolten told reporters on a conference call. "There's a real downside to the US economy if they fail to get this done in a timely fashion."

"A lot of trust has been destroyed," Merkel said. "That is why the industry must do everything to win back credibility and trust, in its own interest and that of employees and German industry."
Criticism from Merkel reflects a huge shift in popular sentiment that has made cozy relations with German automakers a political liability. An opinion poll last month found that 57% of Germans had lost trust in the industry, and two-thirds felt that politicians were still too close to the carmakers.
Long celebrated for its starring role in the German economy, revelations of emissions cheating at Volkswagen (and exploitation of loopholes by others) has exposed the industry to charges that dirty diesel engines are to blame for the country's air pollution problem.
Diesel sales slump, foreign brands advance
Sales of diesel cars have slumped this year and foreign brands are taking market share from their German rivals.
In some major cities, calls to ban diesel cars entirely are gathering strength. Munich, the home of BMW (BMWYY), is considering such a ban. So is Stuttgart, where Daimler's (DMLRY) Mercedes-Benz is based.

Merkel has indicated that it's only a matter of time before Germany follows France, Britain, India and other countries in setting an expiration date for the sale of cars that use only fossil fuels.
It's a remarkable reversal of fortune for an industry that employs over 800,000 Germans -- 2% of the country's workers -- and has enjoyed close ties with the political establishment. The German state of Lower Saxony owns 20% of Volkswagen (VLKAF), for example, and elected leaders have a reputation for lobbying hard for the industry in Europe, and elsewhere.
"There is no other industry as important, and it's clear that there is a close relationship between the government and the industry," said Arndt Ellinghorst, head of Global Automotive Research at Evercore. "The government has always been lobbying for the industry."
Related: Germany says the 'diesel crisis' could hurt its economy
Merkel got her hands dirty too, and not just in lobbying European officials.
Mary Nichols, chair of the California Air Resources Board, testified before the German parliament earlier this year that Merkel had complained about the state's tough emissions standards during a 2010 meeting with former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger.
Nichols said she had never before experienced such an intervention.

Those tough emissions standards -- and efforts to circumvent them -- are at the core of the industry's predicament.
Diesel emits far more harmful air pollutants than gasoline, yet it was popular in Europe for decades because governments offered tax incentives in the hope of reducing CO2 emissions. (Diesel engines were thought to be more fuel efficient.) German and French automakers invested heavily in the technology.
European consumers, who were able to save on fuel costs, gravitated toward more expensive luxury models. In Germany, where both the modern car and diesel engine were born, the number of registered diesel cars had soared by 50% to 15 million since 2008, according to Commerzbank.
Related: German automakers confront a diesel rebellion in their own backyard
But Volkswagen, which owns the Audi, Skoda, SEAT and Porsche brands, could not keep pace with tougher emissions standards. U.S. prosecutors allege that its engineers knew as far back as 2006 that the company's new 2.0 liter diesel engine would not be capable of complying with regulations.
Instead of going back to the drawing board, they designed a "defeat device" software function that allowed cars to detect when their emissions were being tested, and to boost performance during that time.
The scheme went on for nearly a decade before being discovered. When it was, demand for diesels collapsed in Europe, the only market where tax incentives have made them a major factor.
"It's a purely European technology," said Ellinghorst. "You can't sell diesels in the United States and you can't sell them in China."
Throwing money at electric vehicles
German automakers are now pouring investment dollars into hybrid and electric vehicles. Volkswagen, the world's largest automaker by sales, announced last week that it will spend more than €50 billion ($60 billion) on battery cells as it pushes to electrify all 300 models in its range by 2030.
"We have got the message and we will deliver. This is not some vague declaration of intent," said CEO Matthias Müller. "The transformation in our industry is unstoppable."
Related: Germany's economic strength masks rising inequality
The German government wants to see 1 million electric cars on its roads by 2020, a goal that would require major investments in infrastructure, including charging stations.
Merkel, who is leading the polls by a wide margin, would be in prime position to help that transition if she wins Sunday's vote. The economic incentives are clear: German automakers exported 4.4 million cars in 2016.
"There is a big shift underway," said Ellinghorst. "The Germans have to move their know-how away from diesel and into electrics."

Returns have been impressive.
The fund has generated an annual return of 5.9 % since January 1998, a figure that is reduced to 4% when management costs and inflation are included. In 2016, it clocked a 6.9% return worth 447 billion Norwegian kroner ($57 billion).
This year is shaping to be even more prosperous. The fund made 499 billion kroner ($63 billion) in just the first two quarters of 2017.
The fund's value works out to over $190,000 for each of Norway's 5.2 million citizens.


"The proposed transaction has no strategic merit and is a complete reversal of your own publicly-stated strategy of becoming a pure-play specialty chemicals company."

In a statement late Tuesday, Clariant rejected White Tale's criticisms and described the deal as the best option for creating value for all stakeholders.
"Since announcement the vast majority of Clariant's shareholders have expressed their support for the deal," it said, adding that it would not deviate from the agreement with Huntsman.

At one point, Toys 'R' Us showed signs of a turnaround. After being taken private in 2005, Toys 'R' Us filed for an initial public stock offering in 2010. It ultimately withdrew its filing, citing "unfavorable market conditions."
Late Monday, Toys 'R' Us announced that it scrounged up $3 billion in bankruptcy financing, which it plans to use to restructure the company, alleviate its debt burden and revamp its stores.
The bankruptcy filing comes just ahead of the holiday season, the busiest time for the year for Toys 'R' Us. The company said it plans on keeping its 1,600 Toys 'R' Us and Babies 'R' Us stores open across the world, though the Wall Street Journal reported that the company will eventually close some of its underperforming locations as part of the bankruptcy process.
Toys 'R' Us noted in a press release that "the vast majority" of its stores are profitable. But the trend line is pointing in the wrong direction. The company reported that same-store sales fell by more than 4% last quarter, losing $164 million.
CEO Dave Brandon on Monday called the retail landscape "increasingly challenging and rapidly changing" but said he was confident that the Toys 'R' Us brand will "live on for many generations."
"Today marks the dawn of a new era at Toys 'R' Us where we expect that the financial constraints that have held us back will be addressed in a lasting and effective way," said Brandon in a prepared statement.

Toys 'R' Us joins a list of hundreds of companies that have succumbed to the online threat and filed for bankruptcy protection this year. That includes the children's clothing store Gymboree, teen outlet Rue21 and Payless Shoe Source.
It closed its gigantic store in New York's Times Square at the end of 2015. It recently opened a temporary, smaller store for the holidays in another part of the popular Manhattan tourist spot though.
The troubles facing Toys 'R' Us aren't just about competition from Amazon (AMZN, Tech30) and Walmart (WMT). A lackluster summer at the box office might be hurting the entire toy industry, which depends on hit movies to drive sales of licensed toys.
Toy companies also have to deal with the fact that many kids are increasingly playing games on consoles, phones and tablets and not with old-school action figures, dolls and other toys.
Even Lego has been struggling lately. Investors are worried that Mattel and Hasbro could be in trouble, too.
Mattel (MAT), acknowledging the threat from tech, recently hired a new CEO who used to be an executive at Google. Its stock dropped 6% on Monday, to its lowest level since 2009, and Hasbro (HAS) fell 1%. Each company relied on Toys 'R' Us for more than 10% of its sales in the most recent fiscal year.

(This story has been updated with the latest revisions to the Graham-Cassidy repeal bill, as of September 25.)
The Congressional Budget Office is expected to release a preliminary score of the bill this week, but it's not expected to include details on the impact on insurance coverage and premiums.
Graham-Cassidy in a nutshell:Reduces federal spending and block grants it.Caps Medicaid.Waives community rating and essential benefits.
Here's what's in the bill:
Repeal the individual and employer mandates: Obamacare levies penalties on most Americans who don't have health insurance and larger employers who don't provide affordable coverage for their workers. The bill would eliminate the penalty, retroactive to 2016.
Related: Millions could be left uninsured under Obamacare repeal bill
Repeals Obamacare subsidies and ends Medicaid expansion funding: The legislation would eliminate Obamacare subsidies that lower premiums, deductibles and co-pays in 2020. It would also jettison federal funding for Medicaid expansion, which 31 states use to provide coverage for residents with incomes up to about $16,000.
The legislation would turn the federal funding for Medicaid expansion and the subsidies into a block grant program. States would be given a lump sum of money and would have a lot of leeway over how to spend it.
For instance, they could help enrollees pay their premiums and out-of-pocket costs or set up high-risk or reinsurance pools to help protect insurers from costly enrollees and entice them to stay in the individual market. States could use a portion of the money to help those enrolled in Medicaid afford care.
Tonight on CNN: Senators debate the future of Obamacare
Graham and Cassidy say that this provision would return power to the states and allow them to create programs that fit their residents' needs. Also, it seeks to equalize Medicaid funding across the states by taking money from states that expanded Medicaid and giving it to those that didn't. The revised bill changes the formula so the shift isn't as drastic -- more than a dozen of the states that expanded Medicaid are run by Republican governors.
But Democrats and consumer advocates say that many states, particularly those that expanded Medicaid, would lose a lot of federal funding, making it harder for them to provide coverage or assistance to their residents. Also, they note, the block grant is only authorized through 2026, jeopardizing the continuation of funding after that.
Loosens Obamacare's regulations regarding pre-existing conditions and financial protections: The bill would also let states alter several key Obamacare protections for those with pre-existing conditions. While it would still require insurers to provide coverage to everyone, states could loosen a lot of other rules.
So younger, healthier folks could see their premiums go down, but those who need care and older Americans in their 50s and 60s could find themselves priced out of policies or only able to buy skimpy plans that don't cover all their needs.
The legislation would let states eliminate Obamacare's essential health benefits provision, which mandates insurers cover an array of services, including hospitalization, maternity care, prescription drugs, mental health and substance abuse services. This could lower premiums somewhat and give consumers a wider choice of plans. But it would also make it harder for people to buy comprehensive policies so those with pre-existing conditions may not be able to find coverage that meets their health care needs.
States could also change many of Obamacare's financial protections, including limiting how much people must pay out of pocket each year and how much of the tab insurers must pick up. That means that insurers could once again offer plans with deductibles of $10,000 or more for a single person. Republicans have long criticized Obamacare for having high deductibles, which this year cannot exceed $7,150.
Also, states could allow insurers to create multiple risk pools -- meaning those who are healthy could be assigned to one risk pool with lower premiums, while those who are not could be put into another with higher rates.
The new bill would also let states change the Obamacare requirement that insurers could not charge older Americans in their 50s and early 60s more than three times the rates of younger enrollees. Under the Affordable Care Act, younger consumers essentially subsidized the premiums of older ones. All the GOP repeal bills this year have loosened this provision, which has led the influential AARP to blast Republicans for levying an "age tax" on older Americans.
And under Obamacare, many preventative services -- including annual checkups, mammograms and colonoscopies -- were free. States could make changes to this provision, too.

Sweetens deal for Alaska: In an important nod to Murkowski, the revised bill says Native Americans and Alaska Natives enrolled in Medicaid expansion prior to 2020 could continue to be eligible after that point. The state's sizable native population and that group's unique health needs has been a serious concern for Murkowski.
Also, the state would receive a 25% boost in federal matching funds for Medicaid due to its defined high level of poverty.
And Alaska would be eligible for a $500 million pot of money for states that have been granted a certain type of federal waiver. It is one of the few states to meet this criteria.
Revamps funding for Medicaid overall: The legislation would send the states a fixed amount of money per Medicaid enrollee, known as a per-capita cap, starting in 2020.
States could also opt to receive federal Medicaid funding as a block grant for the non-disabled adults and children in their program. Under a block grant, states would get a fixed amount of federal funding each year, regardless of how many participants are in the program.
States, however, cannot opt to receive block grant funding for elderly and disabled participants.
Graham-Cassidy would also shrink the program even more over time by pegging the annual growth rate of funding for children and non-disabled adults to standard inflation after 2024, rather than the more generous medical inflation.
Either per-capita caps or block grants would limit federal responsibility, shifting that burden to the states. However, since states don't have the money to make up the difference, they would likely either reduce eligibility, curtail benefits or cut provider payments. The block grant would be more restrictive since the funding level would not adjust for increases in enrollment, which often happens in bad economic times.

Allows states to institute work requirements for Medicaid: States would now be able to require adult Medicaid recipients to work. The disabled, elderly and pregnant women would be exempt, however.
Permits everyone in the individual market to buy catastrophic plans: Obamacare only allows those under age 30 to buy catastrophic policies, which usually have higher deductibles and fewer benefits. This legislation would allow anyone to buy these plans starting in 2019.
Repeals a handful of taxes: The bill would repeal the tax on over-the-counter medicine, health savings accounts and medical devices, a levy unpopular on both sides of the aisle. But it keeps in place Obamacare's taxes on the wealthy, health insurers and others.
Defunds Planned Parenthood: In keeping with longstanding Republican beliefs, the legislation prohibits federal funding for Planned Parenthood. But the restriction is only for a year, beginning when the bill is enacted.
Increases maximum contributions to health savings accounts: Today, individuals can save up to $3,400 and families can save up to $6,750 a year tax-free in a health savings account. The bill would raise that limit to the annual out-of-pocket maximum for high-deductible plans. For 2018, that would be $6,650 for individuals and $13,300 for families.


In what is emerging as a bitter battle to protect aerospace jobs in both North America and the U.K., Britain's Prime Minister confirmed she will raise the trade dispute with U.S. President Donald Trump later this week during a bilateral meeting. She said she would once again impress upon him the "importance" of the jobs at stake in the United Kingdom.
The U.S. State Department last week cleared Boeing to sell the fighter jets to Canada, even as the potential political ramifications of Boeing's suit against Bombardier continued to unfold.

Boeing opened a case against Bombardier at the Commerce Department's International Trade Commission in April accusing the company of dumping its C Series passenger jets into the U.S. market at "absurdly low prices."
The case was inspired by the 2016 purchase by  Delta Air Lines (DAL) to buy up to 125 C Series airliners from Bombardier. The Canadian firm has denied the dumping accusations and accused Boeing of hypocrisy. An initial ruling by the ITC is expected as early as Sept. 25, according the aviation industry officials.
In a statement to CNNMoney on Monday, Boeing said it was not in a spat with Canada.
"Boeing is not suing Canada. This is a commercial dispute with Bombardier," the statement said. "We like competition. It makes us better. And Bombardier can sell its aircraft anywhere in the world. But competition and sales must respect globally-accepted trade law," it added.
The move against Bombardier could result in serious economic consequences in Northern Ireland. More than 4,000 people work at Bombardier there, the majority involved in making carbon fiber composite wings for the C Series. Bombardier's aerospace division employs 28,500 people worldwide.
Boeing to U.S.: Put tariffs on Canadian rival Bombardier
May acknowledged that a decision from the U.S. Commerce Department is due in late September but cautioned that even if the Trump administration sided with Boeing, it would only be a preliminary ruling.
"There will be a preliminary judgment in the U.S. next week in relation to this case but that will just be a preliminary judgment so it will be possible for us to continue to work together to try and bring about the resolution that we want," she said.

Prime Minister May is vulnerable in Northern Ireland politically, post-Brexit. The Democratic Unionist Party agreed to prop up the May government earlier this year in return for economic investment in Northern Ireland.
Earlier this month, Trudeau said in a statement that the dispute could force Canada to abandon plans to purchase fighter jets from Boeing because the company "is pursuing unfair and aggressive trade action against the Canadian aerospace sector."

Puerto Rico's government owes $74 billion to bondholders, and an additional $50 billion in pension obligations to teachers and almost all other government employees. In May, it filed for the largest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history.
Maria, a Category 5 storm, comes after the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA, issued a major disaster declaration for the island following Hurricane Irma earlier this month. FEMA did not provide an update to CNNMoney on Monday.
Meanwhile, Puerto Rico faces another long-term problem: Many residents are moving from the island for the mainland United States, leaving it with few skilled workers to handle the rebuilding and development process.
The territory's population was down to 3.4 million residents last year from 3.8 million in 2004. Persistently high unemployment, along with better job opportunities in the mainland U.S., have pushed Puerto Ricans to pick up their bags and move, mainly to Florida and Texas, according to the Pew Research Center.
Related: How to rebuild an island after Hurricane Irma
The pace is picking up, too. In 2005, nearly 47,000 Puerto Ricans left the U.S. territory for the mainland. Last year: 89,000 left, Pew reports. Puerto Rico's economy has been in a recession since 2006. It's unemployment rate in August was 10.1%, more than double the national average, according to Labor Department figures.
Puerto Rico's government has tried to lure investors and businesses to the island to boost its tax base. It offers major tax incentives to wealthy individuals who own property or start a business on the island. Its current administration is trying to cut red tape to make it easier for investors to buy Puerto Rican debt with fewer hurdles. It also agreed to be subject to a financial oversight board to help ensure it starts to pay down its debts.
However, the oversight board has criticized Rossello's administration this year for its lack of progress on creating a sustainable debt-payment plan. Rossello argues that the criticisms are unfair and that the island's government is making progress.
Puerto Rico was spared a direct hit by Hurricane Irma, though hundreds of thousands of people lost power and some structures were badly damaged, officials said.

But investors clearly are nervous. Shares of Hasbro (HAS) dipped more than 1%. Mattel and Jakks Pacific tumbled 6%. Mattel (MAT) is now trading at its lowest level since the spring of 2009, while Jakks Pacific (JAKK) is at an all-time low.
Hasbro, Mattel and Jakks Pacific each generated nearly 10% of their overall sales from Toys 'R' Us in their most recent fiscal years.
Toys 'R' Us, like the rest of the retail industry, has been hurt by the dominance of Amazon (AMZN, Tech30) as people increasingly buy toys online. Jeff Bezos might as well be Santa Claus for my two young boys.
Related: Toys 'R' Us to open pop up shop in Times Square
Walmart (WMT) and Target (TGT) have both emerged as big players in the toy market too.
Toys 'R' Us was acquired for $6.6 billion in 2005 by a group that included affiliates of private equity firms KKR (KKR) and Bain Capital, as well as the real estate investment trust Vornado (VNO).
But it has continued to struggle since then. Toys 'R' Us reported a more than 4% drop in same-store sales in the first quarter and a bigger loss than a year ago. The company will report its second quarter results on September 26.
Toys 'R' Us closed its gigantic store in New York's Time Square at the end of 2015. It recently opened a temporary (and smaller) store for the holidays in another part of the popular Manhattan tourist spot though.
Still, the troubles facing Toys 'R' Us aren't just about competition from Amazon and Walmart. A lackluster summer at the box office might be hurting the entire toy industry -- not to mention movie theater chains AMC (AMC), Regal (RGC), Cinemark (CNK) and IMAX (IMAX).
The big toy companies increasingly rely on Hollywood, as hit movies (particularly for kids) drive sales of licensed toys. Hasbro has held up better than its competition thanks to the success of Disney films, which include the Pixar, Marvel and Lucasfilm studios.
Outside of Disney (DIS), the rest of the box office was weak. There are hopes for a fall rebound, thanks largely to the upcoming "Star Wars Episode VIII: The Last Jedi." However, that would largely benefit Hasbro more than the rest of the industry.
September is off to a hot start too. But that's because of the success of the movie based on Stephen King's "IT." Good luck selling toys based on Pennywise the clown.
Toy companies also have to deal with the fact that many kids are increasingly playing games on consoles, phones and tablets and not with old-school action figures, dolls and other toys.
Even Lego has been struggling lately. And Mattel, acknowledging the threat from tech, recently hired a new CEO who used to be an executive at Google (GOOGL, Tech30).
Electronic Arts (EA, Tech30) has soared more than 50% in 2017. Nintendo (NTDOF) has surged 70%. Activision Blizzard (ATVI, Tech30) is up more than 75%. And Take-Two Interactive (TTWO) has doubled.
Toys 'R' Us and traditional toymakers may just not be able to compete for the short attention spans of 7 year-olds addicted to playing Geometry Dash on the iPad. I can tell you that from firsthand experience.


The iShares U.S. Aerospace & Defense ETF (ITA), which has Boeing as its top holding, is up 23% this year. That follows a nearly 20% surge in 2016.
Wall Street was betting before the U.S. presidential election that a win by either Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump would be good for defense stocks since both talked about boosting military spending during the campaign.
Since Trump's victory, defense stocks have continued to shine. North Korea's nuclear threats have investors even more interested in the sector. Two recent mergers are helping to keep the sector firmly on Wall Street's radar as well.
Fellow Dow component United Technologies (UTX) announced earlier this month that it planned to buy Rockwell Collins (COL) for $23 billion. And Northrop Grumman (NOC) said Monday that it intends to acquire Orbital ATK (OA) for nearly $8 billion.
Boeing has expressed some doubts about the United Technologies-Rockwell Collins merger plan since that deal would unite two key Boeing suppliers and potentially lead to higher prices on some aircraft parts.
Related: Another big aviation merger takes flight
But the deal also shows the intense interest among aerospace and defense companies to find merger partners and take advantage of booming demand in the industry.
And Wall Street loves merger activity, which tends to boost stock prices as investors bet on who might be next to get bought.
Boeing, with a market value of about $150 billion and annual sales of more than $90 billion, is more likely acquirer than takeover target of course.
Still, investors are clearly betting that Boeing may not need to buy any of its rivals to stay on top. Orders are coming in for Boeing's new 737 MAX and 787 (aka Dreamliner) commercial jets.
On the defense side, Boeing continues to see demand for its Apache helicopters as well as its missile defense systems.
The combination of Boeing's commercial and military clout is a key reason why analysts expect profits to rise nearly 40% this year and grow at an annual rate of almost 20%, on average, for the next few years.
So it's no wonder why Boeing stock is flying so high.


"Everybody who wanted a quality beer thought they had to get it from an import. The reputation of American beer was terrible," Koch says. "I had to change people's minds about American beer in general."

Brewing runs deep in Koch's family and he's the sixth generation to become a brewmaster. In 1984, he discovered his great-great-grandfather's lager recipe in his father's attic and brewed the very first Samuel Adams lager. He started the company that same year.
Despite his pursuit of the family's passion for brewing, the elder Koch doubted his son. The beer industry had been consolidating and breweries were closing.
"I think he told me when he got out of brewmaster's school in 1948 there were almost a thousand breweries in the United States," Koch says. "When I started Sam Adams 36 years later, that thousand breweries had collapsed down to 50."
He told his father that he wasn't trying to compete with the giant brewers. Instead, he was going to make "rich, flavorful beer in very small batches."
Koch's recipe quickly became a catalyst for the so-called craft beer "revolution."
"I just happened to hit this historic moment when there was an opportunity to change an entire element of our culture," Koch says.
Related: The Marriott family American Dream: From 'Hot Shoppes' to hotels
Today, the craft beer industry is booming at $23.5 billion, according to the Brewers Association, and there are more than 5,000 craft breweries in America.
Koch has since built a billion-dollar (revenue) business, selling between 3 and 4 million barrels of beer each year.
The company's performance has far exceeded his expectations. "My plan was to only get to about a million dollars a year in sales," Koch says.
Despite his father's initial concerns, he was always by Koch's side. "He was on my board from the day we went public," Koch says.
In 1995, Koch took the Boston Beer Co. public, with his father by his side.
Related: Fast food president Kat Cole: How my single mom helped me succeed
One of the many pieces of advice he received from his father was to share the business with someone he could trust.
"I looked around Boston Consulting Group. There were all these best and the brightest with these great degrees. Very, very accomplished people. I realized, hey, they're all like me. They have all the same skillsets. They're not really adding anything," Koch says.

That's where Rhonda Kallman, Koch's secretary, came in. Kallman was also his co-founder and first employee.
"She was an incredible person, and she had different skills than I had. She was great with people, and she knew bars. I knew business. I knew beer, but Rhonda knew bars," Koch says.
In those first months, Koch walked bar-to-bar with a briefcase full of beer trying to sell his Samuel Adams lager and Kallman's familiarity with bars was key to jump starting the business.
About 10 years ago, Koch almost lost the company. Nearly 25 million bottles had to be recalled for possible glass falling into the bottles when capped. His father's reaction has stuck with him.
"He said: 'Jim, we could lose the whole company. You know that, right?,'" Koch recalls. "I said, 'Yeah. yeah, Dad, I know.' Then he said, 'Don't worry. It's been a great ride. Don't worry.'"
"That's the right perspective. Only your dad can give you that. It was like: I don't care if it fails, ride with me," Koch says.
Koch's father passed away six years ago, but he continues to value his business relationship with his father.
Related: Makeup mogul Bobbi Brown on her new venture
"I had this wonderful experience that very few people have, which is I was able to have an adult relationship with my dad as a business partner," Koch says.
Koch's unique leadership style is something he writes extensively about in his book, Quench Your Own Thirst: Business Lessons Learned Over a Beer or Two.
The biggest lesson learned: "Do what you think is going to make you happy rather than what's going to make you rich," Koch says.
He also believes in knowing and accepting your strengths and weaknesses. That's one the reasons why he has remained chairman and founder of the company, instead of CEO.
"I'm not really a good manager. I've never claimed to be a good manager," Koch tells Harlow. "I really focus on two things that I'm accountable for. Those two things are the quality of the beer and the culture of the company. I believe if I take care of those and we've got good managers, we'll be successful. That's what I'm good at."


Earlier this month, United Technologies (UTX) bought Rockwell Collins (COL) for $23 billion. They're two of the biggest suppliers to Boeing and Airbus.

Northrop said it plans to establish Orbital as a new independent business sector within the company. Besides rockets that carry satellites to space, Orbital's businesses include rocket propulsion systems, missiles, defense electronics and precision weapons.
Northrop is competing with Boeing to provide a major upgrade of the nation's Minuteman nuclear missile system, the most significant upgrade in that leg of the nation's nuclear deterrence since the early 1970s. The new system is expected to remain in service until 2075.


Big tech stocks continue to lead the way, despite the fact that many industry leaders are at odds with President Trump regarding his stance on immigration, climate change and other policies.
Lindsey Bell, an investment strategist with CFRA, wrote last week that investors are sticking with tech stocks because gridlock in Washington shouldn't affect businesses like Apple (AAPL, Tech30), Microsoft (MSFT, Tech30), Facebook (FB, Tech30) and Amazon (AMZN, Tech30).
Looking further afield, nearly all European markets were posting healthy gains in early trading. Most Asian markets ended the day in positive territory. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index shot up by 1.2%.
In commodities, crude oil futures are also rising by nearly 1% to trade above $50 per barrel.

4. Coming this week:
Monday -- Business leaders speak about climate change issues at the C40 Talks in New York Tuesday -- FedEx (FDX) and Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY) earnings; Federal Reserve begins two-day meeting  Wednesday -- General Mill  (GIS)earnings; Federal Reserve interest rate decision and press conference  Thursday -- Manchester United (MANU) earnings Friday -- OPEC and non-OPEC oil ministers meet in Vienna


That will all be on display Wednesday when the Fed's policy committee announces its next moves and Yellen holds a press conference.
1. Will Janet Yellen stay or go?
Yellen has politely dodged questions about whether she would stay for a second term, if renominated.
"I really haven't had to give further thought at this point to this question," she told House lawmakers in July.
You can bet that Yellen, whom former President Barack Obama appointed as the first woman to lead the Federal Reserve, will be asked by reporters on Wednesday.
The question gained added importance since the Fed's No. 2, Stanley Fischer, announced this month that he will resign on October 13.
That news means Trump has the chance to fill the Fed's top two jobs.
During the campaign, Trump condemned Yellen as a puppet for Obama. Trump has more recently suggested he'd consider rehiring Yellen for another term, saying she's "done a good job."
It would be highly unusual if he didn't reappoint her: Most presidents keep Fed chairs for an additional term.

2. Is another rate hike coming?
Most economists don't expect the Fed to raise interest rates on Wednesday. It has raised rates three times since last December, twice this year.
Central bankers are in a bind. It's their job to shift policy levers, nudging interest rates higher and lower, to boost jobs and keep prices, or inflation, at the optimal level. That means not too high, and not too low.
Inflation affects prices -- milk, train tickets, everything.
It has been stubbornly low for years. And low inflation can hurt the economy: Businesses get queasy about investing in people and equipment. If prices don't rise, wages don't either.
The problem is that interest rates, which the Fed influences through its federal funds rate, remain low even though jobs recovered years ago. The funds rate effects what people pay on things like mortgages and credit cards. Lower rates promote growth.
In other words, inflation is signaling that the Fed should not increase rates. But economic growth and low unemployment of 4.4% are saying it should.
"We previously expected the Fed to hike interest rates again in December, but the continuing weakness in core inflation had left the chances of a move before year-end as little more than a coin toss and other recent developments have all but killed the possibility," Capital Economics wrote in a recent note.
The other reason the Fed may not raise its fed funds rate this week: Hurricanes Harvey and Irma are expected to ding the U.S. economy in the short-term.

3. When will the Fed start getting its portfolio back to normal?
The other policy decision on Yellen's agenda involves the Fed's so-called balance sheet. That's the enormous amount of debt -- mostly Treasury bonds and securities backed by mortgages -- it racked up during the financial crisis.
The central bank effectively lent trillions of dollars to the government to spur the economy and make it cheaper for everyone to borrow. And now it's time for the Fed to begin selling that debt.
Several Fed officials have signaled the central bank could take a first step in selling off its bonds and other investments starting next month.
An announcement that the Fed will start unwinding its debt would mark yet another milestone in an economic recovery now in its ninth year.
"The [Fed] has been preparing the markets for balance sheet normalization for a long time," Seth Carpenter, an economist with UBS wrote in an analyst note.

The survey includes the CEOs' hiring plans and their expectations for this year's GDP.
Business Roundtable includes a real who's who of CEOs: Apple's Tim Cook, GM's Mary Barra, Pepsi's Indra Nooyi and several others. In May, 36% of those CEOs said they expect to increase hiring. We'll see on Tuesday if their plans have changed.
3. Fed meeting: The Fed will hold a press conference on Wednesday at the close of a two-day meeting.
We'll get to hear about the Fed's new economic projections, and we may learn more about how the Fed plans to wind down its balance sheet. The Fed last met in July, when it decided to hold rates steady. It probably won't raise rates this time, either.
4. FedEx releases earnings: FedEx will release its first quarter earnings for fiscal year 2018 on Tuesday.
The company was hit by a massive malware attack back in June. Its stock dipped in July but rebounded in August. FedEx has also been working to compete with Amazon, launching the logistics network FedEx Fulfillment in February.
5. Bed Bath & Beyond report earnings: Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY) will report second quarter earnings for 2017 on Tuesday.

Traditional retailers like Bed Bath & Beyond have been struggling to compete with online sellers, and Wall Street is expecting things to get worse. According to analysis done by Bespoke Investment Group, investors are more pessimistic about the retail industry now than they have been in years.

A family’s long-awaited vacation came to a bitter halt Tuesday after Irish budget carrier Ryanair announced it would be cancelling their flight. The family, who saved for the trip for 12 months, were told the Malaga, Spain-bound flight was canceled roughly 45 minutes before they boarded.
The airline told International Business Times in a statement that the cancellation occurred as a result of a strike by French air-traffic controllers and “was entirely beyond our control.” More than 20,000 passengers were affected Tuesday as a result.
The Roffee family had reportedly scrimped and saved £2,105 ($2515 USD) for a year in preparation for the trip, British newspaper Mirror Online reported Monday. It was a celebration of the 30th birthday of Simon Roffee, who with his wife Kellie Roffee were accompanied by their four young daughters.
Following the cancellation, the Roffees claimed their attempts to make different accommodations — they were at the Leeds Bradford Airport from 11 a.m. until 6 p.m. — were made in vain. They were offered a flight to depart Monday that would arrive in Spain at 10 p.m. with a return trip departing 11 a.m. the following day — little more than 12 hours after their arrival.
“We normally go away for a weekend camping and we couldn't do it because we were saving up for this holiday, we now won't be getting a holiday this year,” Kellie Roffee said, according to Mirror Online. “We were waiting around the airport, the kids were really excited, we were sat in the VIP lounge and we heard this tannoy and they [were] asking for everyone to go to gate four.”

She said that when they arrived at the gate, the airline “locked the doors and they said nobody was going anywhere” some 45 minutes before boarding. Passengers grew angry, she said, with one woman having a panic attack and crying.
“Amelia-Rose was crying because she was scared, there was a bloke swearing and the police had to come and he almost got arrested,” Kellie Roffee said.
When the Roffee family asked Ryanair if it would be paying for another flight, she said “[the airline] said that was absolutely not going to happen.”
“I feel really bad like I have deprived my children of a holiday, the kids are devastated, absolutely distraught, the next morning my Amelia-Rose came in and asked us ‘are we off on holiday today then?’” Kellie Roffee said.
The family claimed that it was not issued a formal apology, but the airline told IBT in a statement that the family was both refunded as well as issued an apology.
“This flight from Leeds Bradford to Malaga (12 Sep) was regrettably cancelled due to a French Air Traffic Control Strike,” Ryanair told IBT in a statement. “The customers in question have been fully refunded. Ryanair sincerely apologised to all customers affected by this French ATC strike, which was entirely beyond our control.”
Strikes, however, haven’t been the only thing leading to cancellations with the carrier. Ryanair, Europe’s largest short-haul airline, announced Saturday that it anticipated cancelling  40 to 50 flights per day through the end of October. The cancellations — as many as 2,000 — are expected to affect roughly 400,000 passengers and could cost the company $30 million.
The cancellations, according to the airline, occurred after it “messed up in the planning of pilot holidays.”
“We f---ed up here, and we have to fix it. We should have seen it coming. This will have a reputational impact,” CEO  Michael O’Leary said on a conference call, according to the Washington Post. “We should have seen it coming. This will have a reputational impact.”


Uber is yet again in the unfortunate position of having to apologize for a public flub. In its latest blunder, Uber sent out a promotional social media message to customers in Bangalore, India, in which it urged husbands to “let your wife take a day off from the kitchen” for “Wife Appreciation Day.”
The message came with a promotional discount for the Uber Eats food delivery service, BBC News reported.
“Dear husbands,” the message read. “A gentle reminder – Today is Wife Appreciation Day! Order on UberEATs and let your wife take a day off from the kitchen.”
The promotion was swiftly denounced by Uber chief brand officer Bozoma Saint John, who called it “unacceptable.” The company tweeted that it was “totally inappropriate.”
“We’ve removed it,” Uber said. “And we apologize.”

Uber is no stranger to botched messages and public relations nightmares. The company has been fending off allegations of sexism and harassment, which led to founder and CEO Travis Kalanick stepping down from the company in June.
In February 2014, Kalanick was skewered for apparent sexism after he made a joke about his desirability, saying, “We call that Boob-er.” Before he left the company, Kalanick again came under fire for sending a company-wide message regarding a party in which he outlined rules about inter-office sex and “keg throwing.”
“Do not have sex with another employee UNLESS a) you have asked that person for the privilege and they have responded with an emphatic, ‘YES! I will have sex with you,” he wrote. “AND b) the two (or more) of you do not work in the same chain of command. Yes, that means that Travis will be celibate on this trip. #CEOLife #FML.”
Even after Kalanick’s ouster, the company continued to battle allegations of sexism. In a June meeting discussing former U.S. attorney general Eric Holder’s recommendation about how to fix Uber’s culture, a board member started the meeting with a sexist joke. David Bonderman later apologized for the comment after audio was leaked, calling his words “disrespectful” and “inappropriate.”

Budget air carrier Ryanair ( NASDAQ: RYAAY) announced Saturday it would be canceling 40 to 50 flights per day for the next six weeks after scheduling mistakes. They didn't factor in crew vacations.
“We f---ed up here, and we have to fix it. We should have seen it coming. This will have a reputational impact,” said CEO Michael O’Leary on a conference call.
The budget airliner could stand to lose $30 million and the cancellations could affect up to 400,000 passengers, according to Bloomberg Monday.
“We have messed up in the planning of pilot holidays and we're working hard to fix that,” said Chief Marketing Officer Kenny Jacobs to the BBC Sunday.
The Ireland-based company faces a backlog of mandatory crew vacations as outlined by Irish authorities.
“We were trying to give too many pilots blocks of four weeks leave,” said O’Leary. “We have mismanaged that process.”
The cancellations will affect about two percent of the carrier’s daily flights. In order to help e soften the blow of the situation, Ryanair plans a fare sale, to offer bonuses to pilots willing to sacrifice vacation days and to hire more crews.
Ryanair has listed all flights it has canceled through Sept. 20 on its website. The carrier is offering fee-free flight changes and refunds.
European Union rules have much greater protections for flight passengers than in the U.S.
“It is the potential for long-term damage that concerns us. The poor [public relations] could deter future bookings and may well put off more time-sensitive higher yielding demand, like business trips, if the carrier is seen as unreliable and less punctual,” said a note to clients of RBC Capital Markets Monday.
O’Leary apologized on behalf of Ryanair on the call.
“My apologies to our investors but also primarily to our customers for any uncertainty or any inconvenience we’ve caused you over the weekend,” O’Leary said. “It wasn’t done lightly, it wasn’t done out of some dismissive or ‘don’t care’ attitude.”


Get ready for a day full of swashbuckling adventure, just don’t expect Krispy Kreme to participate. Tuesday, Sept. 19 marks annual Talk Like a Pirate Day, but unfortunately for those celebrating and looking to get their annual free doughnut from Krispy Kreme, that’s not an option in 2017.
Krispy Kreme has announced its not participating in its usual Talk Like a Pirate Day freebie promotion and we’ve got the lowdown as to why.
Krispy Kreme announced on Twitter on Monday that the free doughnut promotion will not be in effect on Tuesday. In past years, customers who talked like a pirate would be given a free traditional glazed treat and those who dressed like a pirate would be gifted a dozen free doughnuts.
“As a company we’re not repeating TLAPDay this year,” the company wrote to one customer. “Ahoy! Talk Like a Pirate Day is still a holiday & you can still have fun dressing up. However, we will not be giving away doughnuts for it,” the company stated in another tweet.
Ahoy! Talk Like A Pirate Day is still a holiday &amp; you can still have fun dressing up. However, we will not be giving away doughnuts for it.
&mdash; krispykreme (@krispykreme) September 18, 2017

As expected, fans for the annual freebie event were not pleased, but the company has stated they’re still encouraging patrons to dress up for the occasion. “Please bring your friends, parents, grandparents and kids to dress up,” reads another official tweet. “We love costumes and fun with the family.”
Krispy Kreme’s famous pirate-themed doughnuts are also not listed on the company’s online menu. They company is currently promoting its Pumpkin Spice Cake and Reeses Peanut Butter doughnuts.
Krispy Kreme did not immediately return International Business Times’ request for comment.

So why did Krispy Kreme pull out of the promotion this year? According to the chain, it was because other events took precedent. The Desert Dispatch reported that Sarah Roof, a corporate communications coordinate for Krispy Kreme, said the company “will not be participating in Pirate Day this year” because the company had other events planned. 
Krispy Kreme has advised those upset about the lack of Pirate Day celebrations to enroll in their Krispy Kreme Rewards program to earn more doughnut freebies. Enrolling in the program, which customers can download for free on the App and Google Play store, allows them to earn points towards food and beverages with every purchase. “Loyalty has never been so sweet!” the app touts.
Advantages of the app include earning points towards free doughnuts and beverages, exclusive offers and benefits and a free gift on your birthday. The app also allows doughnuts lovers to be alerted when a location nearest to th em has just created fresh doughnuts.
To ease the pain of this year’s cancelled Talk Like a Pirate Day, those who enroll will be happy to know new customers can earn a free “welcome” Original Glazed doughnut when they sign up.
Krispy Kreme is currently running a Panthers promotion. When the North Carolina-based NFL team scores, “you score.” The promotion gives Krispy Kreme Rewards members points to use towards free doughnuts and coffee every time the team scores. The points will be loaded into reward member’s accounts 48 hours after game day.
Kripsy Kreme will not be participating in Talk Like a Pirate Day this year. A customer is pictured carrying a bag with Krispy Kreme donuts on May 9, 2016 as he leaves a Miami location.  Photo: Getty Images

Nevada could become the first state in the U.S. to allow marijuana consumption in public indoor spaces such as lounges, according to a state legal body this week. The ruling could bolster the already thriving business and give smokers more options.
Nevada's Legislative Counsel Bureau on Monday permitted the use of legal marijuana in public areas only if the user is of legal age. State law does not forbid city or county governments from operating a lounge or club dedicated to marijuana use, the bureau said. Cities and counties are permitted to govern businesses and decide upon the use of special permits, according to the bureau.
The news sparked relief among marijuana users, who will be able to light up in public. Smoking marijuana is banned in Nevada’s casinos and hotels, according to state law. Nevada became the fifth state to legalize the plant on July 1, which allowed adults 21 and older to purchase it.  None of the four other states where marijuana is legal for recreational use — Washington, Colorado, Alaska, and Oregon — allowed smoking in lounges. 
Marijuana supporters welcomed the lounges and called it a logical next step for the state. Nevada is currently one of the most popular tourist distensions in the world with its gaming and conventions and is expected to attract more smokers.
"Allowing regulated social use areas is a good solution that recognizes cannabis consumers' rights to congregate just like alcohol drinkers can in bars while also protecting nonconsumers' rights not to inhale secondhand smoke," Tom Angell, the founder of Marijuana Majority, a pro-legalization group told The Hill. "It should be a no-brainer, especially in tourist towns like Las Vegas where visitors don't have private residences they can go back to imbibe."

However, marijuana naysayers suggested the growing number of lounges and places where the plant can be utilized, increased the chance of crime in the area.
"The people of Nevada wanted folks not to go to jail for using marijuana," Kevin Sabet, head of the anti-legalization group Smart Approaches to Marijuana, told The Hill. "I don’t think they envisioned pot clubs in their neighborhood."
"Data show that areas around marijuana stores have higher crime and issues with second-hand smoke and other nuisances. I can't imagine pot clubs will be a good thing for the state," Sabet said according to The Hill.
Anti-legalization supporters worried about the how carefully regulators would inspect the marijuana being used at the lounges, and what type of impact it would have on the neighborhood.
"Every major social problem is simply exacerbated when you have higher amounts of marijuana available," Carla Lowe, the founder, and co-chair of Citizens Against Legal Marijuana told CBS News. "What is going to be the impact on these people that are driving home and what’s going to be the impact on crime?"
State Sen. Tick Segerblom, D-Las Vegas, who championed marijuana legalization in the state, suggested that bars, lounges and bed and breakfasts could offer a safe place for adults to consume the plant. People already used it in public spaces, he argued.
"What they do is they go to a dispensary and go back to the casinos right now," he told CBS News. "To me, it’s better to openly do it than surreptitiously go back to the casinos."
Cities and counties will issue limited licenses to let businesses test the marijuana lounges "on an experimental basis," Segerblom said, according to CBS News, and stated it would be successful in Las Vegas.
Republican Gov. Brian Sandoval told the Record-Courier Tuesday he hadn't read the opinion yet, but doesn't regard it as the final say in the matter. Sandoval has expressed concern over whether such lounges could invite a federal crackdown in the state given that marijuana is still listed as an illegal, Schedule 1 drug by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency.
"An LCB opinion does not have precedential value," Sandoval told the Record-Courier, adding that he would prefer an official opinion from the state's Attorney General.


What was expected to be a four-hour flight turned into a nightmare for passengers flying from London to Athens on British Airways after the trip ultimately took up a staggering 33 hours instead, according to reports. The ordeal ultimately involved four separate planes, one of which had to be evacuated after an engine caught fire.
The incident began Tuesday, Sept. 5 as the initial flight was scheduled to leave Heathrow Airport around 1:15 p.m. local time, the  Evening Standard reported. Passengers were alerted the flight had been canceled due to a faulty cockpit warning light, and a second flight was later scheduled to depart at 5 p.m. — however that flight was later canceled, as well.
The airline told the Evening Standard that the second scheduled flight had to be canceled because its flight crew would have exceeded their permitted hours of work. The pilot reportedly called the announcement “the most embarrassing PA announcement I have had to make.” Additionally, passengers were unable to deboard for another hour, with the airline citing “security issues.”
The passengers were compensated with hotel vouchers for accommodations in London. It was unclear Friday how many of the same passengers returned for a third flight with the airline the following day.
Passengers who did return to the airport Wednesday were scheduled to depart around 1:40 p.m., but the trip was again foiled. Shortly after takeoff, witnesses reported hearing several loud bangs before the starboard engine caught on fire. Geoff Lye, a 67-year-old passenger on the plane who was traveling with his partner, recounted the madness to the Evening Standard.
“I’m an atheist but even I was praying,” said Lye, a business advisor. “Our hearts were racing. Passengers behind me said they could see flames kicking out from the engine.”

The flight’s captain reportedly told passengers that everything was “under control” but that the engine had to be shut down and the plane would be returning, yet again, to Heathrow Airport.
“We landed perfectly safely, accompanied by a fire engine,” Lye said. “At this point we were just delighted to be alive.”
Passengers were able to board a fourth plane around 7:40 p.m. Wednesday, and the plane touched down in Athens early Thursday morning.
“We fully appreciate how frustrating this experience has been, and have apologised to our customers for the long delay to their flight,” the  airline said in a statement to the Daily Mail. “We provided refreshments and hotel accommodation during this time, and the flight arrived in Athens on Wednesday night.”
While the incident was certainly an extraordinary culmination of unfortunate events for passengers who were significantly delayed by days, engine fires are rare but not unheard of. Earlier this month, a Delta Air Lines flight from Las Vegas to New York was forced to make an emergency landing after  one of its engine’s caught fire.
Tom Farrier, a retired U.S. Air Force command pilot, wrote about what occurs when a plane’s engine catches fire in a lengthy  post on Quora published last year.
“Engine fires rarely cause really serious trouble if they remain confined to the engine itself,” he wrote. “You shut off the fuel and use your fire extinguisher; the fire goes out; then, you land as soon as practical to make sure nothing else was damaged by the event. As long as nothing really dire caused the fire, it’ll get everybody’s heart rate up nicely but it usually can be quickly and safely resolved.”


Forever 21 was accused Thursday of allegedly stealing and selling the intellectual property designed by Word, a Los Angeles-based public relations agency. Word's founders, Zoila Darton and Angela Carrasco, intended to use the shirt's profits to aid Planned Parenthood (PPH). Twenty-five percent of the profits from each sale would go towards funding PPH.
The T-Shirt was first created in July. Word, however, discovered a design similar to its shirt on Forever 21's website Thursday. The public relation's agency took to Instagram to share a side-by-side post of its "Creator" T-shirt and the competing shirt sold by Forever 21. 
"We're not ones to point fingers but this looks mighty familiar. For the record, we created this shirt with a purpose. Too bad they removed the Swahili, Arabic, Hebrew & Japanese," Word wrote on Instagram Thursday. 
PLEASE SHARE: Hey @forever21, we're not ones to point fingers but this looks mighty familiar. For the record, we created this shirt with a purpose. Too bad they removed the Swahili, Arabic, Hebrew & Japanese ____ #CreatorShirt #Forever21 DONATE ALL THE MONEY TO @plannedparenthood
A post shared by WORD (@word.agency) on Sep 14, 2017 at 5:08pm PDT
 
The two shirts share some similarities, but there are also visible differences. Forever 21 removed some of the foreign translations of "woman," it used different font styles and rearranged the ordering of the words. 
"Forever 21 decided they liked the design we created at WORD to raise money for Planned Parenthood," Darton wrote on Facebook. "If you see this shirt in the windows of this shit store — do not purchase this cheap knockoff of an idea I created over a year ago and executed with my brilliant designer husband."

Word received thousands of orders on its graphic T-shirt following the controversy.  
A representative from Word and Forever 21 did not immediately respond to International Business Times' request for comment. 
This was not the first time Forever 21 came under fire for allegedly replicating and selling designs that aren't their own. Forever 21 suffered several copyright or trademark lawsuits over the years by either taking ideas from graphic designers or even other big-name retailers. However, the retailer has managed to depart several incidents unscathed. 
H&M sued Forever 21 in September 2015 for allegedly copying its "Beach Please" bag design. The lawsuit detailed that Forever 21 was guilty of copyright infringement over a bag H&M began selling in stores April 2014. H&M's lawsuit, which was handled in a New York federal court, claimed the design has gained "secondary meaning in that H&M is recognized as the original source of the tote bags," according to The Fashion Law.
Up-and-coming graphic designers face challenges when rising to success. However, this becomes much harder when their artistic property is stolen by major retailers. Sam Larson, a freelance graphic designer, allegedly had his designs ripped-off by Forever 21 in 2015. Larson, who claims to have his work stolen frequently, told BuzzFeed, "I put so much time and effort into my work to try to make it as freelance artist and then companies do this".
Forever 21 isn't the only well-known retailer to receive criticism for reportedly stealing designs. Urban Outfitters was accused by Soares, a designer who sells his work on various websites like Society 6, for using his designs in a mini-skirt in 2014, according to Huffington Post. Zara also came under fire for copyright infringement in 2016. Tuesday Bassen, a designer who has previously worked with Nike and Urban Outfitters, noticed several of her designs were being stolen and sold by Zara.

Most people who have heard of blockchain technology unsurprisingly associate it with cryotocurrency—typically bitcoin or perhaps ether. While those and other cryptocurrencies utilize the blockchain, they are but one new product made possible by the blockchain. 
The components of the blockchain—distributed consensus protocols, cryptography, and economic incentives based on game theory—are not new; rather, the blockchain combines them in novel fashion in the form of a shared ledger that allows consensus to be built and maintained on a distributed, decentralized basis by parties with no inherent reason to trust one another. 
The potential for this new technology is immense. 
Many believe that the blockchain will drive profound change in such diverse fields as artificial intelligence, autonomous vehicles, identity, governance, and land transfer, to name just a few.  Since its inception in 2009, the blockchain has been the basis for many proofs of concept, each advancing a solution—some grounded in present-day possibility, some more in the realm of science fiction—for a “problem”—some real, some postulated.

Perhaps surprisingly, one of the more tangible implementations for the blockchain has been advanced by the State of Delaware, which in 2016 launched the Delaware Blockchain Initiative to explore how the blockchain might qualitatively improve its suite of corporate services offerings. This initiative, headed by Andrea Tinianow, has teamed up with one of the leading blockchain technology platforms, Symbiont, as part of its efforts. Together they have pioneered several services on the blockchain, including issuing and trading corporate securities and the automating various aspects of Uniform Commercial Code filing and monitoring.
A small state with big ideas, Delaware is home to nearly two-thirds of the Fortune 500 companies and has long prided itself as being the domicile of choice for businesses in the United States. It has even earned the nickname as “the corporate capital of the world,” a status that has been well-earned. Supporting its corporate infrastructure, the Delaware legal system is at the forefront of legal issues impacting complex business transactions, and its judiciary is home to leading experts in such issues. The Secretary of State’s Office also plays a big part in Delaware’s success, constantly improving the user experience and maintaining foresight to ensure that the State’s offerings and systems are always on the leading edge of customer demand. 
The Delaware Blockchain Initiative is just the latest result of these unique factors. In late July, Delaware Gov. John Carney, Jr. signed a bill into law making it legal for companies to use the blockchain to issue securities and maintain corporate records. 
What does that mean to you?  When can we expect implementation?
We recently hosted a Delaware Fireside Chat in New York City which was attended by Delaware Secretary of State Jeffrey Bullock and Director of Corporations Kristopher Knight assembled together with some 60 industry stakeholders — bankers, attorneys, technologists, and even some representatives of foreign governments. The discussion was lively and clearly there's an appetite for Delaware advancing the initiative based on the audience participation. 
On Delaware’s part, we detected no small measure of caution about moving forward, with references to concern regarding the interests of Delaware’s citizens and constituency. 
No doubt, any agents of disruption will be met with legacy naysayers who enjoy the status quo…but at what cost? 
That is the difficult question and environment government officials must try to answer and navigate.  Ultimately the delegation’s response left many somewhat perplexed, as it seemed to indicate the pace of advancement would slow.
Adopters are awaiting the ability to access and utilize various services.
We have penned an “Open Letter to Delaware” in which we give a more organized voice to industry enthusiasm for this initiative and provide some specific suggestions as to how the State of Delaware’s leadership in this space will result in innumerable benefits in corporate management and governance.  
Indeed, an entire suite of services—well beyond the digitization of ownership interests—could be provided to business entities of all types and sizes.  For example, these services could include a blockchain-based ledger for the storage and registry of corporate documentation such as operating agreements and board records to enhance and support entity-level recordkeeping.
Additionally, corporate voting could be implemented swiftly and efficiently using a blockchain-based system which could fundamentally change the way in which shareholders participate in the governance of their companies.
Ultimately the transformation of corporate services by the State of Delaware to one powered by the blockhain has the potential to be a watershed moment in the history of corporate formation, practice, management, and governance in the United States.
Much like the internet did before it, the advancement of the blockchain in this area is likely to generate additional value-added opportunities that at present we cannot envision. We believe the demand of companies big and small alike to move into a new century of corporate practices is quite high, as the benefits of the efficiency and immutability of distributed ledger technology with no single point of failure is extremely attractive. 
The world is watching and waiting.

As Bernie Sanders worked to finalize his Medicare-for-All Act of 2017, corporate lobbyists representing the traditional opponents of single-payer health care — including the nation’s major private insurers and drug companies — poured hundreds of thousands of dollars into Senate Democrats’ fundraising accounts. Now, many of those lawmakers have refused to sign on to the Medicare bill.
Sanders has faced questions about whether or not the bill would garner solid support among Senate Democrats. So far,  16 Senate Democrats have said they will sponsor the legislation — which the insurance industry slammed after he announced it. A  new study from campaign finance watchdog group MapLight found that since 2010, Democratic senators who have refused to sponsor the bill have, during their careers, raised twice as much insurance industry cash as those who support the legislation.
As Republicans took over the White House earlier this year, significant campaign funding for Democratic senators has continued to come from lobbyists. According to federal campaign finance records reviewed by International Business Times, lobbyists, lobbying firms and one other corporate political action committee collectively delivered nearly $2 million in bundled campaign contributions to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee during the first half of 2017. Sen. Chris Van Hollen, the DSCC’s chairman, was a  proponent of the law that requires lobbyists to disclose the contributions they bundle together from donors.
With Sanders and a  majority of House Democrats supporting single-payer — and with  polls showing rising support for a Medicare-for-all system — lobbyists for major health care industry clients were among the biggest donors to Democrats in the Senate, as they have been in years past. Among those who delivered the most cash to the DSCC in the first half of 2017 were:
- Steve Elmendorf, the former top aide to then-House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt. He delivered $130,400 to the DSCC while representing insurance giant  UnitedHealth Group Inc. and dialysis conglomerate  DaVita Inc.
- Jonathon Jones, the former chief of staff for Sen. Tom Carper, a Finance Committee member has not signed onto the single-payer initiative. He delivered $97,000 to the DSCC while representing insurers  Anthem Inc. and the  Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, as well as the trade group  Pharmaceutical Research Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) and drugmakers  Amgen Inc.,  Astellas Pharma Inc.,  AstraZeneca,  Merck & Co. Inc.,  Novartis,  Genentech Inc. and  Vertex Pharmaceuticals.
- Lisa Kontoupes, a former aide to  President Bill Clinton and staffer for Democrats on the House Energy and Commerce Committee. She delivered $77,500 to the DSCC while representing drugmakers  Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Inc. and  Teva Pharmaceuticals Inc..
- David Castagnetti, the former top aide to Montana Sen. Max Baucus, who was accused of blocking a debate over single-payer during the Affordable Care Act deliberations. Castagnetti delivered $64,000 to the DSCC while representing insurers  Humana Inc.,  Blue Cross Blue Shield of Arizona and the parent company of  Oscar Health Insurance.
- Jeff Forbes, the former staff director for Democrats on the Senate Finance Committee, which oversees the nation’s healthcare system. He delivered $20,000 to the DSCC while representing the drug industry’s trade association,  PhRMA, as well as individual drug companies  Abbott Laboratories,  Amgen and  Genentech.
The principals of major lobbying firms also gave big to Senate Democrats. Tony Podesta, the namesake of the Podesta Group and a top Hillary Clinton bundler, gave $202,476 to the DSCC while representing the  American Healthcare Association and  Mylan — the controversial maker of the Epipen. Heather Podesta of Podesta + Partners delivered $226,400 to the DSCC while representing  Baxter Healthcare and insurer  Cigna.
Meanwhile, two lobbying firms’ corporate political action committees gave directly to the DSCC. Brownstein Hyatt Farber’s PAC, for instance, bundled $307,000 for the DSCC while the firm represents  Anthem, the  Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association and drugmaker  Abbvie. Holland & Knight’s Committee For Effective Government bundled $104,650 for the DSCC while representing  BlueCross Blue Shield of Minnesota.


Update: Thursday, Sept. 14 at 4:08 p.m. EDT —  The original story now includes responses from both airline carriers. 
Original Story:
Basic economy passengers on American and United Airlines should measure their carry-on luggage carefully. If it’s too big to fit under the seat, passengers may be hit with service fees of $50 or more.
Most basic economy seats do not come with the option of having a bag in the overhead compartment. If a passenger doesn’t realize this rule or tries to get around it, they could wind up paying more in fees than they saved by getting the cheaper ticket. Carry-ons too large to fit under the seat are subject to the standard bag checking fee of $25 and then on top of that hit with a $25 fee if they wait to check the bag at that gate instead of the desk. Both companies rolled out the fees early this year. 
American calls their charge a gate-service fee, while United calls theirs a gate-handling charge. American and United don’t entitle their basic economy passengers to the typical two carry-on bag allotment of one overhead and one underneath bag. Delta, on the other hand, does.
Fees could go even higher if the unplanned bag is the second bag checked. United charges $35 for the second checked bag.
American Airlines spokesman Josh Freed told International Business Times over the phone that the fee is made clear through the process and that passengers can go back and check their bags at the desk if time allows to avoid the gate charge fee. 
“We do everything we can to make sure customers do not reach the gate with a bag that needs to be gate-checked,” United spokeswoman Maggie Schmerin told the Wall Street Journal Wednesday.
Both companies told IBT that the bag policy is made clear when passengers purchase the tickets. 
United has said that the practice of not giving basic economy passengers overhead bin space streamlines departures because gate agents aren’t tagging and checking as many bags.
American’s reasoning for the additional fee is to ensure passengers check the bag before it gets to the gate.
Fees and charges are now a very integral part of air travel. Many major airlines started using baggage fees in 2008. Domestic flight change fees are now typically $200.
Last year, U.S. air carriers earned $4.2 billion in baggage fees and $2.9 billion in ticket change and cancellation fees, according to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics. That over $7 billion represents more than half of airlines profits in 2016.
Airlines charge fees for a variety of other services, including pets, unaccompanied minors and booking flights over the phone or in person. Coach passengers also face ever-shrinking seats. 


Ahead of Equifax Inc.’s announcement that it suffered “a cybersecurity incident potentially impacting approximately 143 million U.S. consumers,” as a Sept. 7  press release from the consumer credit reporting firm stated, it was well aware of the risks of a hack, and of the danger that it may not have had “adequate” insurance to cover associated losses.
In spite of efforts to stave off the risk of a breach, “our information technology networks and infrastructure or those of our third-party vendors and other service providers could be vulnerable to damage, disruptions, shutdowns, or breaches of confidential information due to criminal conduct, denial of service or other advanced persistent attacks by hackers,” the company stated in the “risk factors” section of its most recent annual  filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, dated Feb. 22. “Unauthorized access to data files or our information technology systems and applications could result in inappropriate use, change or disclosure of sensitive and/or personal data of our customers, employees, consumers and suppliers.”

The company also expressed concerns that its “property and business interruption insurance may not be adequate to compensate us for all losses or failures that may occur” in the event that “such access, disclosure or other loss of information could subject us to litigation, regulatory fines, penalties or reputational damage, any of which could have a material effect on our cash flows, competitive position, financial condition or results of operations.”
Equifax held an insurance policy covering between $100 million and $150 million around the time of the news of the hack, but will likely have to fork over multiple times that amount in related penalties, Bloomberg  reported last week, citing “people familiar with the coverage.” The firm may face fines from the federal government on multiple fronts. The Federal Trade Commission, for example, confirmed Thursday that it was conducting an investigation of the breach, and lawmakers from both parties have urged the SEC and Justice Department to look into a possible case of insider trading by Equifax’s executives, three of whom shed $1.8 million in shares in the company just days after the discovery of the hack.
In a more recent  filing for the second quarter, dated July 27, the firm said its risk factors had not changed from those listed in the annual report, in which the company also had said it was “not aware of any material breach of our data, properties, networks or systems.” The Sept. 7 press release stated that Equifax became aware of the hack on July 29, two days after the company filed its quarterly report. 
An Equifax spokesperson did not immediately respond to requests to comment on the firm's risk assessments and the timeline of its awareness of the data breach. 


This summer a federal court ordered the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to look into shrinking seat sizes in coach on airline carriers and determine its effect on passenger safety. In the court case a judge called the situation “a plausible life-and-death safety concern.” 
Safety testing for the airlines is outdated and that no airline has coach seats with enough space to meet the Department of Transportation’s (DOT) guidelines for flight attendant safety, a new investigative report by the Daily Beast Wednesday discovered. 
Flyers Rights, an advocacy group for airline passengers brought the suit against the FAA. The group said that the smaller seat space can lead to longer evacuation times. The space between rows has shrunk from 35 inches to between 28 and 31 inches, according to CBS News.
“The biggest concern is that you won’t be able to get out in time before you’re overcome by smoke or fire,” said Paul Hudson, president of Flyers Rights in a Wednesday interview with CBS News. “You won't be able to get into the brace position which means your head will hit the seat in front of you and break your skull.”
The FAA requires that airplane, regardless of size, be able to be evacuated in 90 seconds or less with at least half of the exits blocked. A critique of these tests is that they are done in a hangar and often not in emergency landing conditions.
A 2015 Delta flight that veered off of a snowy at La Guardia Airport in New York City, for example, took 17 minutes to deplane.
Besides limiting egress, another concern of tight airplane seats is the risk of head trauma in the event of a crash or hard landing.
Seat pitch size refers the axis of space a passenger has from the bottom of their seat. If a passenger were to lean forward either to crouch or by forced impact, the pitch is how much space they have in relation to the seat in from of them. The DOT requires at least 35 inches for flight attendants, but no airline offers any more than 32 inches for passengers.
The FAA has until December 28th to respond to the court’s ruling.


Bitcoin and blockchain media group CoinDesk has released its latest The State of Blockchain Report, which reveals digital assets are nearly twenty times more lucrative than property, gold and stocks combined.
The report reveals year-over-year returns on global real estate (3.2 percent), gold (7.7 percent), U.S. equities (9.2 percent), and global equities (14.7 percent) pale in comparison to returns on bitcoin (150.6 percent) and all digital assets (445 percent).

The 115-page report contains a breakdown of the historic surge in cryptocurrency across April, May, and June, including statistics on transaction numbers, fees, ICOs, token value propositions, enterprise adoption, research and development, regulation and industry challenges.
CoinDesk Director of Research Nolan Bauerle said: "This quarter's State of Blockchain Report is remarkably eye-opening. Blockchain and digital assets are already solving real-world problems in business, government, technology and finance, and the impact on markets has been extraordinary. At the end of Q1, the total cryptocurrency market cap was valued at $23 billion. Largely due to ICOs, the total market cap for digital assets hit $109 billion by the end of Q2."
While JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon recently called bitcoin "a fraud" and likened it to the Dutch tulip craze, the report told a different story. "The State of the Blockchain report dispels common myths and uncertainty surrounding blockchain through facts and exhaustive research from the top analysts in the space," said CoinDesk CEO Kevin Worth. "The statistics in the Q2 report speak for themselves; enterprise and institutions are taking this asset class seriously and investor confidence is climbing exponentially. In Q2 alone, blockchain token sales raised a combined $797 million, three times that of venture capital's $235 million investment in blockchain companies," Worth said.
In addition, the report shows records being smashed right, left and center: Q2 2017 saw the largest amount of combined blockchain transactions ever, at over half a million per day, while bitcoin's total market capitalization doubled. Global digital asset exchanges reported record trading volumes during the quarter, and returns for several ICO tokens since inception were historic, including Augur (4,583 percent returns), Golem (4,700 percent), ICONOMI (2,862 percent), Melonport (1,136 percent), First Blood (2,667 percent), Digix (2,393 percent) and SingularDTV (1,033 percent).
However, Q2 also saw some industry challenges. Due to Bitcoin's heavily publicized network congestion issues, transaction fees quadrupled from 62 cents in Q1 to $2.40 in Q2, while Ethereum's transaction fees rose by 918 percent within the same period. Further, in a blockchain sentiment survey, over 72 percent of the sample audience indicated bitcoin mining is too centralized, while 95 percent indicated ICO issuers should not convert funds raised into fiat currency.
"There will always be growing pains in an industry that added a billion dollars a day in value across Q2. Solutions are being worked on for blockchain backlogs, transaction capacities and reducing fees. The technology is advancing quickly and we are confident the industry will continue to boom. Regulation appears to be clearing up in Europe and Asia, while new guidelines are being instituted within the United States," said Bauerle.
In response to the unprecedented rise of cryptocurrency in Q2,  CoinDesk is launching Consensus: Invest, an event tailored to the growing number of wealth managers interested in cryptocurrency.


R3 has hosted its first CordaCon event in London, just before the release of Corda version 1.0 at the end of this month.
Introducing the event, R3 lead engineer Richard Gendal Brown said Corda 1.0 is an important mark in the sand for the banking consortium, providing API stability for a growing army of developers. He also announced the expected release of the first enterprise version at the end of the year, which will feature things like Intel SGX, enhanced DLT performance and greater disaster recovery capabilities.
Privacy was going to be a governing theme for the day: lead platform engineer Mike Hearn had arranged a compare and contrast between SGX and zero knowledge proofs, while Intel and Microsoft were on hand to talk in detail about architecture. There was also going to be a discussion with demo around cash, and specifically the challenge of multiparty netting on distributed ledgers.
Simon Johnson, Intel's SGX program architect, began by looking at trusted execution environments in some detail. SGX changes the memory architecture of computers, he said, leveraging an "Enclave Page Cache Map" (EPCM), a protected structure used by the processor to track the contents of the EPC.
Mike Hearn clarified that developers building apps for Corda would not have to delve into the fineries of SGX; R3's engineering team have gone to some lengths to implement the JVM inside the enclave. "So you don't have to do anything. This is what we are shielding you from," said Hearn.
R3's relationship with Microsoft has always been strong and is now deepening, said Marley Gray, principal architect, Azure Blockchain Engineering, Microsoft. Ethereum remains by far the most popular thing people want to spin up on Azure, something of a rite of passage. "We also have to support Fabric," added Gray, "and we see a lot of things like hackthons happening. But for PoCs it's a no-brainer. You will see a lot more R3/Azure templates going forward."
Gray explained Microsoft's middleware approach vis-à-vis underlying blockchains and also said the roadmap for shipping the oracles or cryplets that connect to smart contracts was this calendar year.

As well as useful side offerings like like identity and key management, Gray touched on the intriguing idea of blockchain data lakes, in conjunction with machine learning and AI. Referring to public chains more than enterprise, he said: "With the data visibility you get with Ethereum and Bitcoin, who knows what we are going to learn? This is going to be big – we just don't know how big."
Mike Hearn began his talk, "Decrypting the future of privacy with ZKP, SGX" stating that what distributed ledgers are trying to do is a paradox; you want to show but you don't want to tell.
Zero knowledge proofs, where the proofs themselves are visible to everybody but what's being proved is invisible, have a downside in terms of their computational burden. Hearn pointed out that current DLT deployments only work for crypto-assets, such as Z-cash, so smart contracts are out for the time being.
He also flagged up the complexity of attempting to express business logic in terms of equations. "Good luck with this," he said, showing the room a code sample.
Research into this area of cryptography is moving in a risky direction, warned Hearn, as proofs based on new assumptions are pushed along much faster than the usual 10-20 year period of mathematical pondering.
"Zero knowledge proofs were immediately branded 'moon math' for a reason. It's not usual for me to ask that people innovate less fast, but there have been mistakes in the mathematics. I do want to see this succeed because it will make society better," he said.
Drilling down, R3 engineer Konstantinos Chalkias said the discovery of succinct signature size of 288 bytes changed everything in the ZKP world. However, these and other forms of cryptography will not survive the "quantum apocalypse".
"Shor's algorithm can break existing cryptography with less than 2000 qubits. This is a problem for public blockchains," said Chalkias.
He pointed out that the expected risk of RSA and elliptic curve cryptography being broken is 15% by 2026, which jumps to 50% by 2031.
"Corda supports the SPHINCS algorithm so we are prepared for the quantum apocalypse," he said.

A mere handful of people working at banks have actually thought about how to do multiparty netting on distributed ledgers. As well as trade-offs between settlement frequency and settlement efficiency, there's a question of whether efficient netting can be done in a completely decentralised manner.
Some experts believe you have to temporarily centralise an aspect of the algorithm in order to perform the equivalent of a batch exercise, for example, which entails passing control to a trusted entity for a short while – a broadly-trusted node on the distributed ledger or a trusted oracle.
R3 deals with financial use cases using a concept of flows, which don't just change the state of the ledger, but also chart the complex dance between parties that leads up to that point.
Corda models cash as IOUs against banks, and it's these obligations which are being settled. Achieving atomicity with payments of cash and netted obligations began by setting out certain requirements, said Dave Hudson, director, Solutions Architecture at R3.
For instance, participation in the netting cycle would be optional; everybody gets to choose how much cash they want to put in the netting solution. It also needed to be fast, and you can't "stop the world", the system has to keep running and never end up incomplete.
Hudson said: "We use flows; lots of flows. From a high level, it can be broken down into a detect phase and an execute phase.
"Any node can start a scan; talk to neighbours it has obligations with, payments they would like to go in the netting cycle (we use pseudonyms)."
All the information about the different payments to be settled is computed. All participants must agree and their signatures gathered for this to work; if not, the flow will fail and nothing will happen.
"Corda's flows framework and consensus mechanism do this single transaction. Corda flows are powerful building blocks. This isn't really a finance problem, it's a network problem," said Hudson.
He gave a demo of a netting transaction, adding that the whole thing involved a relatively small amount of code, under 1,000 lines.
"It's complex and compact and avoids using a single trusted node which would be a single point of failure."


In 2016, GOP Rep. Brian Babin didn’t even have a Democratic challenger in Texas’ 36th Congressional District. He beat a Green Party candidate with close to 90 percent of the vote in the general election. The 36th is considered a “safe” Republican district by the Cook Political Report, but this time, two Democrats are running in their party’s primary — and in the wake of Hurricane Harvey flooding, they see a chance to win.
Harvey wreaked havoc on southeast Texas, putting some communities under more than 50 inches of water. The Houston area and nearby Gulf Coast region is home to numerous oil refineries and chemical plants, many of which have emitted  benzene plumes and other toxic chemicals into the air because of shutdowns and explosions due to flooding. One plant in Babin’s district, owned by French chemical manufacturing company Arkema, suffered numerous explosions on August 31 and the days after, releasing dangerous airborne toxins that sent police and first responders to the hospital.
Arkema  successfully lobbied against key chemical safety provisions with the help of elected officials including Babin and nine other Texan members of Congress, as  International Business Times reported. Babin co-sponsored a House  bill to strike down these safety regulations, which were written under former President Obama and set to take effect in March. Environmental Protection Agency Director Scott Pruitt has delayed the rules’ implementation twice this year, and they won’t apply until February 2019, if at all.
Babin’s office did not return requests for comment.
Candidates Support Praise Benefits Of Regulation
Geologist Jon Powell and fellow Democratic candidate Dayna Steele, a well known former rock radio host, plan to use Babin’s role in opposing the chemical safety standards against him. Steele told IBT that she “absolutely” supports instating the chemical safety rules that Babin and Arkema successfully delayed.
“Everyone frames [chemical safety rules] as, ‘Ooh it’s a scary regulation.’ Regulations are protections put in place to protect people,” said Steele, who worked as a crisis communications consultant for some chemical plants in the area. “People can now see what we’ve been trying to say all along… It appears that a lot of the regulations maybe could have prevented [the Arkema explosions] from happening.”
These regulations have other benefits, too, Powell said. “The term regulation always seems to have ‘job-killing’ in front of it. But it’s quite the opposite: they’re job-creating regulations… The truth of it is, when companies have to install environmental protection they have to purchase it, install it, maintain it and audit it. It all creates jobs.”
The cost of refining crude oil into gasoline is about 16 percent of the total cost of standard gasoline, said Powell. Only a fraction of that amount — around 5 cents per gallon — goes towards environmental protection, he said.
But Arkema, the American Chemical Council lobbying group and many other chemical and oil companies have come out against increased safety measures at their plants. Powell speculated about the source of the opposition in a September 7  op-ed in the Texas Tribune.
“A basic function of government is to protect us. Ask yourself if laws and regulations that were in place before Harvey struck made the situation better or worse. Who advocated for those bad policies? Was it the people who have a financial incentive to not spend the necessary funds for protection and their bought-and-paid-for lawmakers?”

Steele decided to run for office after the 2016 elections, feeling “stunned each and every day on everything from health care to education to relaxed regulations to DACA.”
“Global warming — let’s call it what it is. Climate change is very real…Science is fact. I don’t care if you don’t like it,” said Steele, who is married to a rocket scientist.
Powell, too, is focusing on Babin’s environmental record. “Babin has voted against this so-called [Waters of the United States] regulation that…regulates contamination of runoff from privately owned lands,” said Powell. “But chemicals are in the water…and they don’t understand property boundaries.
“When plants not required to operate safely they push cost of consequences of their unsafe choices onto the taxpayer,” said Powell. “Babin and his cohorts either don’t realize that or they’ve been bought by the lobbying and campaign contributions.”
Fossil Fuel Funds In Politics
The oil and gas industry has been kind to Babin, having donated nearly  $115,000 to his federal campaigns since 2014, his first Congressional race. In just the 2016 election cycle, he received over $40,000 from the political action committees of oil and gas companies including Koch Industries, Exxon Mobil, Halliburton and Valero Energy. Arkema, the owner of the exploding chemical plant in his district, gave Babin  $3,000 over the 2014 and 2016 election cycles.
In 2018, Democrats are looking to take advantage of an unpopular president, a chaotic White House and a GOP-led Congress that has failed to pass any significant legislation.  23 congressional districts held by Republicans went for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 general for president. But Democrats are split on how to win back the House:  Centrist super PACs have appeared, supporting a “big tent” party and looking to elect conservative Democrats in areas that usually vote GOP, while progressive organizations such as Our Revolution and Justice Democrats are backing leftist candidates. Meanwhile, Democratic senators are lining up behind Bernie Sanders’ Medicare-for-all bill, which he plans to introduce on Wednesday.
In a flood-damaged district, though, local issues are paramount, Powell has said.
“I’m hoping that people will see that Babin has brought nothing to the district,” Powell said. “People don’t really care about who goes to what bathroom or spending a bunch of money on a wall on the Mexican border.”
“With floodwaters still flowing in parts of Texas, and Hurricane Irma eyeing the U.S. mainland, the current political talk is about tax cuts for the wealthy or the residency status of nearly 800,000 children and young adults,”  wrote Powell on September 7. “Lowering the taxes on the highest earners does nothing to solve the problems so many people face in Southeast Texas.”


New York Fashion Week (NYFW) has become a major business venture — a chance for designers to demonstrate their creative visions and a vital money-making opportunity, too.
NYFW emerged in 1943 as Press Week by way of legendary fashion publicist Eleanor Lambert, creator of the International Best-Dressed List. International Management Group (IMG) now serves as NYFW's official organizer. IMG operates the showcase: securing venues, acquiring sponsors and providing full production services to brands, among other duties. However, every intricate detail from preparation, model castings and the runway shows themselves are executed by the brands.
"It is the perfect combination of art and commerce," James LaForce, CEO of LaForce PR, told International Business Times. "Some things make perfect sense and follow a playbook. Other things are a complete surprise and come out of nowhere. It's what makes it so fun."
Any designer that wants to partake in NYFW can do so. The challenge is to secure CFDA recognition on the official NYFW calendar. Brands typically apply at least two months in advance to secure a featured calendar listing.
"The various NYFW organizing bodies try to accommodate every designer's request. That said, there are only so many hours in the day," LaForce said. "If every designer had their choice, they would show late morning or in the middle of the afternoon on a weekday. That means everyone is competing for the same time slot."
"The major brands that have been showing for many seasons and years tend to get priority on the calendar," Jane Lerman, the CEO and Founder of L.E.R. Public Relations, told IBT. "Newer brands are usually slotted in around these established brands to ensure there are no conflicts for the top tier buyers and press who attend the majority of the shows."
Putting on a successful show can be costly for brands, especially those that are working with a smaller budget. The most basic show costs anywhere from $150,000 to $200,000, but the budget can increase for big-name brands with extra cushion to play with.

"Some brands, like the major fashion houses with very large marketing budgets, can spend several hundred thousand dollars, sometimes nearing or going over the $1 million mark," Lerman said. "The budget is really determined by the venue and the type of models booked for the show."
New York City reaps the benefits of NYFW. State Senator Brad Hoylman said NYFW adds nearly $900 million to the city's economy, according to a 2015 press release. The event may reel in tourists worldwide, but where the show is presented can also benefit local businesses. 
"The business model now in New York is that more shows are showing in unique off-site venues and that makes the entire city the 'official' fashion week venue,'" Lerman said. "Designers today can choose to do presentations at hotels, at photo studios, in privately owned lofts, on rooftops, in restaurants, and even in parks. So what ends up happening is that all of NYC benefits business-wise from NYFW."
Lerman added, "The week brings in a ton of travelers from all over the world, making it a great time for hotels, local shops and restaurants, cab drivers, and beyond. It also brings a great deal of PR and social media exposure to various places in the city, making people far and wide excited about New York."
Tadashi Shoji, who has been in the business for 35 years, told IBT, "I'm a businessman, so I have to think about money, budget and stuff like that — we are not a billion dollar company." Shoji's Spring/Summer 2018 line incorporates the beach and blue sky to create a Southern California vibe. "This is advertisement and promotion, and we have to show it to the media and buyers… Then, how much is budget? How much is exposure? Those kinds of stuff, if you don't figure it out, I don't think you can continue this kind of business."
Shoji said the key to success in the fashion industry is determining a clear path for the brand.
"You have to think about what kind of direction you're going to go," Shoji said. "If you do it too expensive, then it's not accessible to everybody. If it's too commercial, then it's going to be boring."
It's also important to see what's going on around you — and move quickly. "You can feel something is coming; you have to catch it," Shoji said. "If you don't catch it, you’ll have [a] problem."
Thanks to all our supporters for an amazing show today! Here's to a great rest of the week for all the designers. @nyfw #nyfw2017 #TadashiShoji #TadashiShojiSS18

"I've been in China doing different shows; Paris and Korea as well. New York Fashion Week is the most commercialized and it's the most known for fashion," designer Jia Liu, whose latest parent-child collection uses travel as its inspiration, told IBT. "It means a lot to come over and show what I have. I've learned quite a lot."
Liu didn't want to talk about the budget for her show. The Beijing native, who believes fashion is "like artwork and commercial," told IBT: "I spend most of my energy, labor, time [on the show]…this is more important than the money." 
Fashion Week is a key time for models as well as designers. 
"A model can book anywhere from no shows to more than 20 during New York Fashion Week," a representative from The Society Management, the agency that represents Kendall Jenner, told IBT. "Though it seems like they are only on each runway for a few minutes, what is typically not seen is how many additional hours might be involved for the fitting, hair and makeup, and countless other appointments in between each show."

Models attend several castings throughout Manhattan a few days before NYFW starts. Casting appointments can extend into the early days of NYFW, too. Models will not only meet with casting directors but also stylists and designers.
"After a detailed selection process by the brand's team, the chosen models for the show are scheduled for fittings, where each look in the collection is tailored to its correlating model, and soon after the clothes will be presented on the runway," The Society Management added.
For models selected to walk the catwalk, the payout isn’t all it’s cracked up to be. Unless the model is a household name like Giselle Bündchen or Kendall Jenner, the payment could be minuscule. Models are often paid in designer clothing, but the average paycheck is $48,130 for the week.
The highest paid models earned a combined total of $154 million last year, according to Forbes. Bündchen was the highest supermodel at $30.5 million, followed by  Adriana Lima at $10.5 million and Jenner earning $10 million, respectively.

The ultra-wealthy are ultra-wealthier than they may appear — at least, to their respective tax authorities. That’s because, perhaps unsurprisingly, those who exploit offshore tax shelters are not likely members of the average household, but rather those in the top one percent of the one percent of income distribution, a trend that’s increasingly concealed the severity of wealth-inequality over the past several decades, according to two studies published this week.
Using leaked information — namely, the  Panama Papers and  files from the British bank HSBC — about overseas tax havens and the individuals who exploited them, researchers from the University of California, Berkeley, the Norwegian University of Life Sciences and the University of Copenhagen  found that “top 0.01 percent households are much more likely to hide assets abroad than households in the bottom of the top 1 percent.” More specifically, a household with a net worth of between $10 million and $12 million is twice as likely as one with between $5 million and $6 million to hide its wealth abroad. Increase those household assets from the latter range to about $45 million, and the likelihood of offshore tax sheltering also rises. by a multiple of four.    In their study "Tax Evasion and Inequality," researchers in the U.S. and Scandinavia found that the percent of an individual's wealth that's hidden overseas increases markedly as their wealth increases. Photo: Gabriel Zucman, Annette Alstadsæter and Niels Johannesen - "Tax Evasion and Inequality"
“Offshore wealth is very concentrated at the top,” said Annette Alstadsæter, a professor at the Norwegian University of Life Sciences and one of the three authors of the two studies. She called the results “striking,” and emphasized the importance of using new information on tax sheltering to craft effective public policy, as, thanks to such leaks as the Panama Papers, “one can hope that there isn’t much of a safe harbor for offshore tax evasion anymore.”
The reason for the concentration of the hidden wealth among the super-rich may have more to do with a supply of specialists who can help them hide their wealth in places like Switzerland and the Cayman Islands, rather than demand for such services. As the authors point out, “taxpayers with more than $50 million in wealth face the same marginal tax rates as those with $5 million, are more likely to be (non-randomly) audited and yet seem to evade much more.” But because banks that offer tax avoidance services are more likely to be caught when they offer those services to a larger swath of clients, the researchers suggest, “it is optimal for banks to only supply tax evasion services to the super-rich.”
The gap between the total wealth held by the top earners and the assets they disclosed domestically has widened substantially over the past several decades, the study also noted. In Norway, for example, the difference between the assets that the top 0.01 percent disclosed and those individuals’ true total assets, both hidden and disclosed, as a share of the country’s total wealth grew to nearly 1.5 percent in 2010 from roughly three-quarters of a percent in 1970 and an almost negligible amount in 1930. 
In Norway, the gap between what the ultra-rich disclose and their total wealth has widened over the past several decades, rendering traditional measures of inequality somewhat misleading.  Photo: Gabriel Zucman, Annette Alstadsæter and Niels Johannesen - "Tax Evasion and Inequality"
The authors’ estimates may even skew conservative, as the paper examined only Scandinavian countries, which, they wrote, citing earlier research, “consistently rank among the countries with the highest social trust, lowest corruption and strongest respect for the rule of law.” Tax evasion among the highest earners, they concluded, “may be even higher elsewhere.”
In a second  study, also published this week, they sought to add some certainty to that presumption, calculating what they described as the first “country-by-country estimates of offshore wealth” and measuring the effects of foreign tax sheltering on inequality. The impact was most acute in Russia, where the top 0.01 percent held more wealth offshore than they did domestically. Similarly, in some of Europe’s economic powerhouses, such as the U.K. and France, between 30 and 40 percent of the wealth owned by the 99.99th percentile is sheltered overseas. In the United States, however, the authors noticed a different, but no less striking, situation: “In the United States, offshore wealth also increases inequality,” the wrote, “but the effect is more muted than in Europe, because U.S. top wealth shares are already very high even disregarding tax havens.”
The sheer amount of wealth hidden overseas has drastically distorted the appearance of income inequality in many developed countries, such as Russia, according to the newly published study, "Who Owns Wealth In Tax Havens? Macro Evidence and Implications for Global Inequality." In the U.S., however, not so much.  Photo: Gabriel Zucman, Annette Alstadsæter and Niels Johannesen - "Who Owns Wealth In Tax Havens? Macro Evidence and Implications for Global Inequality"
As in Scandinavia, the amount of wealth held overseas by the highest earners in other developed countries, such as France and the U.K., grew significantly over time, likely resulting in a somewhat rosier picture of wealth inequality than the reality. And, once again mirroring the team’s findings in Scandinavia, those totals could be grossly understated, Alstadsæter noted.
“Since we only include financial assets and not real assets such as art, gold, and yachts, true offshore wealth can be expected to be even higher than our estimates," she said.
As in Norway, the amount of wealth those in the highest portions of the income distributions in both France and the U.K. have hidden in foreign tax havens has risen substantially in the past few decades.  Photo: Gabriel Zucman, Annette Alstadsæter and Niels Johannesen - "Who Owns Wealth In Tax Havens? Macro Evidence and Implications for Global Inequality"
According to Matthew Gardner, a senior fellow at the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank, the reason the U.S. exhibits such a high level of wealth inequality, even without hidden holdings taken into account, is that “we have a tax system that’s pretty much designed to help individuals accumulate wealth.”
“It’s obviously a completely legitimate system of rules, but one that’s geared toward inequality,” he said, adding that the problem could be more excusable in developing nations with less governmental and financial structure and stability. “We have the structure in place where we can monitor tax avoidance. We have no excuse.”
To combat such abuses, former President Barack Obama signed into law in 2010 the  Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act, better known as FATCA or the “Fat Cat” tax, an additional reporting requirement for Americans with overseas assets and the financial institutions catering to them. While it passed by a  70-28 Senate vote, it’s  faced a fierce repeal campaign from both lobbyists and Republican lawmakers critical of government overreach. Critics on both sides of the aisle have pointed to hypocrisy on the part of the U.S. government for requiring financial institutions in other countries to disclose its citizens’ assets while  refusing to sign an international initiative similar to FATCA, called the Common Reporting Standard. The U.S., after all, featured prominently in the Panama Papers — which, as Gardner put it, might as well have been called “the Nevada Papers.”
“The U.S. has been a willing partner for a long time in the secrecy of financial assets,” he said. Until the White House and Congress enact or amend laws to boost transparency of global cash flow and increase taxes on capital gains as opposed to incomes, or “to tax wealth like work,” Gardner said, “we’re going to see continued growth in wealth inequality.”


The Republican congressman from one of Hurricane Irma’s hardest hit counties is leading a legislative effort to let companies conceal how climate change affects their businesses. Only weeks before the storm came ashore, Florida U.S. Rep. Bill Posey reintroduced  legislation designed to bar federal regulators from forcing companies to better disclose their climate-related risks to their shareholders. Amid  fossil fuel  industry lobbying on the bill, a version of Posey’s legislation was  passed by the House last year, and now — despite hurricanes and floods intensified by climate change — the legislation could get a boost from a Trump administration that has moved to roll back efforts to combat global warming.
Climatologists have said that while climate change may not have caused Hurricane Irma, warmer waters intensify such storms. Still, Florida has twice elected a Republican governor who has  questioned the science behind climate change and whose administration has barred the use of the terms “climate change” and “sea-level rise” by state officials. Meanwhile, in Washington, Florida’s Posey has taken a similarly high-profile leadership role in fighting efforts to confront climate change.
Posey, of District 8, represents Brevard County — which  sustained significant damage, flooding and  power outages from Irma. Since being elected in 2008, Posey has voted against enforcing limits on carbon pollution and in favor of barring the EPA from regulating greenhouse gases. He signed a pledge to oppose any climate change legislation that increases government revenue. As a member of the powerful Financial Services Committee, he has most prominently spearheaded legislation to kill a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) initiative designed to compel corporate executives to tell their shareholders how their companies could be affected by climate change.
Posey’s office did not immediately return an International Business Times request for comment.
Posey’s initiative revolves around the SEC’s  2010 directive, which required companies to publicly disclose the impact climate change will have on their businesses. The directive, said the agency, was “intended to remind companies of their obligations under existing federal securities laws and regulations to consider climate change and its consequences as they prepare disclosure documents to be filed with us and provided to investors,” reads the guidance.
Elected to the House in 2008, Posey first wrote legislation in March 2010 to  roll back the SEC’s directive. The bill was referred to committee that year, so Posey revived the bill in 2011, and again it didn’t make it out of committee. At the time, Posey said in a  press release that the SEC’s climate risk guidance was “yet another startling example of how the Administration is making it worse for job creators across our country. Our bill blocks the SEC from forcing American employers to conduct burdensome and expensive climate analysis.”
In 2016, Posey tried again with an  amendment to an appropriations bill prohibiting funds from being used to address the SEC guidance on climate change; the House approved that amendment on July 7, 2016.
Leading up to the House approval, the fossil fuel industry was lobbying Congress, along with the SEC itself, against the guidance. Texas-based petroleum refining company Tesoro, now known as Andeavor,  lobbied on climate risk disclosure, as did the  American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers, a trade association that represents nearly all of America’s refining capacity and petrochemical manufacturing facilities, and which is  funded in part by the Koch Industries PAC and the American Petroleum Institute. AFPM employed lobbyist Justin Daly to lobby Congress and the SEC on the issue; Daly previously worked as a senior counsel to the House, Senate and SEC.
Ceres, a nonprofit organization that advises investors on sustainable investing,  lobbied against Posey’s proposal.
In the same month that the Posey amendment passed, fossil fuel trade groups submitted letters urging the SEC to avoid expanding its existing climate disclosure mandates. Among the groups that submitted letters were the  American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers; the  National Mining Association, which represents the greater coal, metals and minerals mining industry; and the  U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which counts major fossil fuel companies among its top members.
“Mandatory disclosure for climate change would not benefit the market or investors,” AFPM wrote. “Requiring a company to disclose social and environmental matters that are not material or sufficiently certain would effectively force the company to support social and environmental policy agendas that lie outside the SEC’s authority and that disregard the company’s purpose and strategy as a business.”
The environmental group Ceres  countered with its own letter to the SEC, encouraging the SEC to strongly enforce its 2010 climate risk guidance and to issue new rules. The nonprofit coordinates the “Investor Network on Climate Risk, a group of 120 institutional investors managing more than $14 trillion in assets focused on the business risks and opportunities of climate change.”
Now in 2017, Posey is trying  once more to have the guidance rescinded.
A History Of Climate Denial
Like Florida Gov. Rick Scott, Posey has questioned whether climate change is caused by human activity. At a congressional hearing in 2014, Posey challenged White House science advisor John Holdren, asserting that because of periodic ice ages, the climate must naturally adjust, or warm, in the intervening periods.

After the House passed his amendment last year, Posey called climate change “a political agenda with its supporters lobbying on behalf of special interest groups to set policies that include more unnecessary red tape for American businesses.”
Posey’s 2016 Democratic challenger in District 8, Corry Westbrook,  wrote, “Financial disclosure would not only protect investors, but would also pressure corporations to manage their exposure to climate change risks. But not according to Congressman Bill Posey.
“His amendment will harm investors, our local economies, our children and our planet,” she continued. “It would let real estate companies be quiet on the risks posed to waterfront properties by rising seas and let agriculture and food companies leave the impact of future drought unaddressed.”
In Posey’s congressional district sits the National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s John F. Kennedy Space Center, its primary launch center for human spaceflight, where Posey once worked. NASA is one of the key agencies researching climate change, but Posey  wants to end that critical research.
Posey has received nearly  $87,000 from the energy and natural resources sector during his state and federal campaigns, according to the National Institute on Money in State Politics.
The Trump administration appears to be slashing climate measures as quickly as it can — with Trump  pulling out of the Paris Climate Accord, EPA Director Scott Pruitt  blocking more than 30 environmental rules, and Interior Sec. Ryan Zinke  fast-tracking oil and gas exploration permits for federal lands. But Trump’s pick to chair the SEC, Jay Clayton, has, as a lawyer, advised fossil fuel companies to  increase their disclosure of climate-change impact.


American Inc. has taken steps to help those affected by the two hurricanes — Harvey and Irma — that hit the country within a space of a fortnight.
Retail giant Walmart is leading the way, pledging an additional $10 million to the $20 million it has already allocated for relief to those affected by severe weather conditions in the U.S. in 2017.
“We know our associates and customers make the difference. And once again, when needed the most, they are stepping up to help in a major way,” President of the Walmart Foundation and Chief Sustainability Officer for Wal-Mart Stores, Inc, Kathleen McLaughlin, said, Business Wire reported. “This is about neighbors helping neighbors and we will continue to be there for the communities we serve as they recover.”
Walmart launched a new customer campaign, wherein the the company will match customer donations two-to-one, in cash and kind of up to $10 million.
The money and the products will support American Red Cross disaster-response efforts by providing shelter, food, comfort and emergency assistance to those affected by the hurricanes.
The company has urged its customers to donate at registers for hurricane relief at Walmart stores as well as Sam’s Clubs. They can also login to their online portals — Walmart.com and Samsclub.com — to show their generosity. Customers also have the option of texting the word “SUPPORT” to 90999 to donate $10 via wireless carrier.

Walmart isn't the only big business with a big heart out there.  An array of companies have stepped forward with financial contributions to assist in America’s efforts to pick up the pieces after the devastation caused by the storms in Texas and Florida.
Apple has pledged an additional $5 million to “Hand In Hand” campaign, an ongoing fundraiser that will distribute collected funds between several organizations helping in relief efforts after Harvey and Irma.
The drive has been collecting funds since Harvey flooded Houston, and includes a celebrity-studded telethon on Sept. 12 that will air on all the major networks – ABC, CBS, FOX, NBC and HBO, CNN reported.
Apple had previously donated $5 million to the Red Cross ($3 million contributed by the company and $2 million by its employees), which is working tirelessly to help those affected by Hurricane Harvey.
The company will also make it easier for their customers to start donating money for the cause through their various apps. "Starting this weekend, anyone with an iPhone, iPad, Mac or PC running iTunes can donate directly through the App Store and iTunes," the company said in a statement.

The founder and CEO of Dell Technologies, Michael Dell — also a Houston native — has given $5 million to the campaign. Verizon, which will be running a call center for the drive, has also pledged $2.5 million to “Hand in Hand.”
"The corporate response thus far [has] been strong," Marc DeCourcey, senior vice president of the Chamber of Commerce Foundation, told CNNMoney.
The response is a continuing one ever since Harvey hit Texas, and a clutch of companies came forward to do their bit for relief efforts.
American Express donated $150,000 to the Red Cross. An additional $100,000 was given in employee donations to the organization.
AT&T contributed $350,000 to various charitable organizations, including $100,000 to the Greater Houston Community Fund, $100,000 to the Red Cross Hurricane Harvey Fund and $50,000 to the Coastal Bend Community Foundation in South Texas.
The Boeing Charitable Trust and The Coca-Cola Foundation committed $1 million each to the Red Cross for Harvey relief efforts.
Facebook donated $1 million to organizations on providing support. The social media giant announced Aug. 31 that more than $10 million had been raised through donations from its users.
Google.org is donated $250,000 to the Red Cross, to match employee donations of up to $250,000. The tech giant also launched a similar campaign for consumers, with donations reaching up to $1 million.
IBM donated $2 million in cash and kind, including technology and services. McDonald's contributed $1 million to the Red Cross, while Microsoft announced a $100,000 grant to the same.
Many of Samsung's U.S. subsidiaries donated $500,000 to the Red Cross. The company also pledged $500,000 worth of products, including washing machines, dryers, laptops and tablets to rebuild homes in the disaster-struck areas.
The Starbucks Foundation donated $250,000 to the Red Cross. It has also made arrangements for its customers to donate through its chain of stores across the country.
According to Una Osili, associate dean at the Indiana University Lilly Family School of Philanthropy, companies have gotten more generous in their contributions over the years.
"Employees themselves want to work at companies that are engaged in a broader social good and making the community better," Osili said.


A Toronto airline excluded a local family from a flight, pushing them to spend an extra $4,000 on tickets, only to take the same flight the next day.
Air Canada prevented Shanty Thivakaran, husband Thiva Maheswaran, their two young boys and Maheswaran's mother from getting on a flight June 27. The airline manager stopped the family from boarding the flight — even though there were eight vacant seats, CBC News reported Sunday.
The family arrived two hours early for their flight to London from Toronto's Pearson airport.
"They're not willing to acknowledge that they're in the wrong," Shanty Thivakaran told CBC News.
From London, the family planned to fly via Air India to Sri Lanka for a vacation, but their plan went awry when an Air Canada agent pointed the family to the wrong check-out line. About an hour and a half before takeoff, another agent redirected the family to the right queue, where three passengers checked in ahead of them for their London flight.
An agent checked in the Maheswaran family, but stopped when a manager said a family of five was a "no-go." They assumed the airline overbooked the flight, but Air Canada told CBC the flight had eight vacant seats before takeoff.
"We were so upset," Maheswaran said. "My mom's crying, the boys started crying. I was almost crying. It was an emotional scene."
An agent directed the family to a ticketing line, where they assumed Air Canada would rebook their flight, but that never happened. They waited for an hour before the desk closed and were stuck.
The airline then pointed the family to another check-in clerk who informed them she couldn’t assist them because she didn't have proper ticket training.
"At that point, I didn't know whether to laugh or cry," Thivakaran said. "I never felt so helpless. I felt like I was banging my head against the wall."
Thivakaran claimed the same manager they dealt with prior asked them to go home and that Air Canada could rebook them for another flight the next day.

The family exited the airport at midnight and returned at 9.a.m. the next morning. They waited in the ticketing line for two hours, but when they spoke to an agent, she claimed she couldn't help them. The clerk told them the airline categorized their family as a "no show," meaning that they didn’t show up for their initial scheduled flight.
The airline claimed they bought the tickets through a travel agency so they were marked as "private fair" and only the agency could fix the matter. The only resolution was to purchase a new set of tickets.
"I paid rightfully for this ticket. I didn't buy it off the black market," Thivakaran said.
The agent refunded their money and sold the family new tickets for an Air Canada flight the same day, which cost them charge fees plus added penalties for last-minute tickets. In total, the family spent $12,326.38 for their trip, which was $5,345.83 more than their original purchase.
"This is money we worked hard to earn, and there's no reason why we should be ripped off," Thivakaran said.
After they returned from their vacation, Thivakaran complained to Air Canada and requested reimbursement. Instead, the airline offered the family 25 percent discount on subsequent flights.
"I just fumed," Thivakaran said. "That action on their part was just too little too late."
The family learned their travel insurance will absorb the $1,350 they spent in fees.
They considered legal action against the airline for the $3,995.83 extra they paid. The Maheswaran family wanted an apology and an explanation from Air Canada, too.  But that might not be enough.
"I'm never traveling on Air Canada again," Thivakaran said. "Even if I was on my death bed and I needed immediate treatment in U.S., I'd rather die than go on Air Canada."


If you want to know if you were one of the 143 million people whose data was breached in a hack of Equifax’s data, the company has a website you can use to find out — but there  appears to be a catch: To check, you have to agree to give up your legal right to sue the company for damages. The outrage that clause has now generated could complicate the company’s efforts — backed by Republican lawmakers — to block an imminent rule that would ban companies from forcing customers to agree to such provisions.
On  Friday, social media users spotlighted fine print on Equifax’s website that appears to force users to agree to waive their class action rights if they use the company’s website to see if their personal data was exposed by the recent hack. It is precisely the kind of arbitration clause that a pending Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) rule is designed to outlaw — if Republicans and the Trump administration allow it to go into effect as scheduled later this month.

Federal documents reviewed by International Business Times show that in response to that  2016 rule, the Consumer Data Industry Association (CDIA) — which  says it is “the trade association which represents Equifax” — pressed regulators to back off the proposed prohibitions, saying the regulations would subject data companies to tough penalties if during a class action suit they were found to have broken the law.
In one section of the  letter, CDIA declares that federal regulators “should exempt from its arbitration rule class action claims against providers of credit monitoring products.” The letter asserted that allowing customers to sue companies “would not serve the public interest or the public good” because it could subject the companies to “extraordinary and draconian civil liability provisions” under current law. In another section of the letter, Equifax’s lobbying group says that a rule blocking companies from forcing their customers to waive class action rights would expose credit agencies “to unmanageable class action liability that could result in full disgorgement of revenues” if companies are found to have illegally harmed their customers.
Equifax’s lobbying group argued against the prohibition even as it acknowledged that a  2015 government study found “that credit reporting constituted one of the four largest product areas for class action relief” for consumers. Consumer groups countered the claims of CDIA and other rule opponents by saying the ability to file suit is necessary to protect Americans’ legal rights.
“The use of forced arbitration clauses has created a closed system where corporations allow court access only when it’s in their interest, where it is functionally impossible for consumers to recover small dollar amounts they are due under law, and where the deterrent effect of class actions has been lost,” wrote the Consumer Federation of America in a 2016  letter to the CFPB.
As written, the rule may not prevent Equifax from restricting customers’ legal rights as they seek to find out whether they have been harmed by this week’s data breach: The legal language says the arbitration provisions would apply only to contracts and terms of service six months after the rule goes into effect. However, the massive data breach and backlash against the company’s arbitration clause may impede Republicans’ efforts to repeal the rule.
“Equifax is doubling down on this data breach with a breach of that trust,” said Karl Frisch, executive director of consumer watchdog Allied Progress, in a press release. “This is nothing more than an underhanded attempt to deny the victims of this cyber attack their day in court... There couldn’t be a clearer example of why this new rule from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is so essential.”
With frustration about the breach and the website language simmering, Equifax issued a statement Friday evening. “In response to consumer inquiries, we have made it clear that the arbitration clause and class action waiver included in the Equifax and TrustedID Premier terms of use does not apply to this cybersecurity incident,” said the company. 
Equifax has delivered more than  $500,000 of campaign cash to Republican lawmakers since the creation of the CFPB in 2010. During that time, congressional Republicans have waged a campaign to weaken the CFPB, culminating in this year’s Republican legislative proposals to  repeal the rule and  fully eliminate the agency. A top Trump-appointed regulator — former  bank lawyer turned Acting Comptroller of the Currency Keith Norieka — has also  previously pushed for the rule to be delayed.
According to government watchdog  Public Citizen, 24 Republican senators co-sponsoring a bill to kill the arbitration rule have, over the course of their political careers, collectively received over $11 million in campaign contributions from commercial banks and over $100 million from the financial sector overall.
Equifax itself has directly lobbied the CFPB on the arbitration rule. Federal records show that since the  second quarter of 2015, a team of lobbyists from Equifax’s own government relations shop lobbied the Bureau on the “Use of arbitration agreements involving consumer financial products and services.” This year, the company was still lobbying the CFPB; during the most recent period for which lobbying information is available, the  second quarter of 2017, Equifax had five lobbyists personally pushing the CFPB to revise the rule.
The company and CDIA are also both lobbying Congress on a Republican-sponsored House bill, pointed out by journalist David Dayen on Twitter on Friday, that would cap class action damages at $500,000 and eliminate punitive damages altogether. The bill's sponsor, Barry Loudermilk (R-GA), announced CDIA's support.
A long-time CDIA lobbyist and former top staff member from the Senate Banking Committee, Geoffrey P. Gray, is now lobbying Congress on a Republican bill to repeal post-2008 financial regulations. Federal  records show that Gray has been working specifically to influence “provisions related to the structure, powers, and funding of the CFPB.”

Delta added 2,000 more seats Thursday to help people who wanted to flee Hurricane Irma. The day before, however, they were accused of price gouging an evacuee 600 percent after the traveler tried to purchase a Delta ticket from Miami to Phoenix through Expedia. The airline, who has a troubled past, quickly dispelled the rumor and helped the evacuee find a reasonably priced ticket.
 The carrier added flights to airports in Punta Cana, Nassau, Freeport, Key West, Miami, Ft. Lauderdale, Sarasota, Orlando and more, they said in a press release.
One-way flight prices to and from southern Florida were capped at $399. This price is slated to last until Sept. 13.
Delta loosely addressed their price gouging drama, citing a source that said supply and demand plays a factor in the price of plane tickets.
“There's only so much airline capacity to any destination. When bad weather hits, there's typically a surge of last-minute demand,” Henry Harteveldt, a San Francisco-based travel industry analyst, told thed airline. “Normally, these last-minute fares may be expensive. When bad weather may affect a city or region, an airline can make more last-minute, lower-fare seats available to help people who need to travel find and get an affordable fare.”

Previously, Delta denied increasing the cost of plane tickets because of the storm. “We have absolutely not been raising prices,” a spokesperson told International Business Times Wednesday.
The accusation was raised Tuseday by Leigh Dow, a public relations executive, who was trying to safely evacuate from the hurricane area. She shared a screenshot that showed her flight from Miami to Phoenix was “jacked up” 600 percent.
“Shame on you @delta. Jacking from $547 to over $3200 for people trying to evacuate responsibly? #IrmaHurricane,” she tweeted.
The rep blamed Expedia.com for the problem. Ultimately, “she was satisfied with the fare she got,” the rep said.
Considering the deadly nature of Irma, Delta said they would not charge an additional fee for anyone who wanted to make changes to their travel plans.
The airline advised the best option when looking for a plane ticket was to call them directly or go to Delta.com. Leigh, whose tweet was shared more than 57,000 times updated her followers she was given a fair price.
“The @Delta team explained how it happened, and another airline was also involved. That wasn't obvious to me. They intervened & helped us out,” she wrote. “.@Delta reached out & helped tremendously. Note to travelers, always call airline directly if something doesn't look right.#IrmaHurricane.”
As Irma heads toward Florida, Gov. Rick Perry cautioned people who lived on both coasts to get ready to evacuate. “Every Florida family must prepare to evacuate, regardless of the coast you live on,” he said.
At the time this article was written, it was unknown if Irma would make landfall in Florida. The storm killed at least 11 people and decimated Barbuda, destroying 95 percent of the buildings.

Shortly after Hurricane Irma left a path of destruction in the Caribbean, Florida residents flocked to stores to stock up on food and supplies to prepare for the impending Category 5 storm. Last-minute shoppers should hurry as supermarket chain Publix announced that it will close stores. 
Experts categorized Hurricane Irma as the most powerful Atlantic storm in a decade, as it barreled through the Caribbean with maximum sustained winds of up to 185 miles per hour Thursday. 
South Florida residents stocked up in preparation for the storm but late-comers may be out of luck, as Publix announced Thursday that it will adjust store hours and close several locations due to the storm.
"Due to Hurricane Irma, several of our stores in South Florida will be adjusting their operating hours," the Publix website read.
The supermarket chain said it planned to alter store hours at certain locations as well as close several South Florida locations come noon Saturday. Locations in Miami-Dade and Broward will close Friday at 9 p.m. Palm Beach Locations will close Saturday at 12 p.m., according to the store.
With hurricane Irma approaching, our stores located within the Florida Keys will be closing. For updated info visit: https://t.co/E09zki4VWk
&mdash; Publix (@Publix) September 7, 2017
Update: Publix will have store closures in south and central Florida. For full list and details visit: https://t.co/DCoTPsYjT6
&mdash; Publix (@Publix) September 7, 2017
Altogether, the supermarket chain will close 77 locations in Miami-Dade, 77 locations in Broward, and 69 locations in Palm Beach County. However, Publix’s Winn-Dixie location hasn’t announced exact closing times.
"We will continue to stock our stores and keep them open as long as we can do so safely for our associates," Joe Caldwell, Southeastern Grocers corporate communications manager told the Miami Herald. "Every store is different, but there is no ‘cut off’ time for deliveries — they’ll be made as long as there’s staffing and it’s safe to do so."
Management at the Hollywood location allowed patrons into the store at 6.a.m., an hour before the store’s usual opening time, ABC-affiliated WPLG reported Thursday.
However, when south Florida residents flocked to Publix to stock up on supplies, they discovered that the store had run out of most essentials. The store ran out of bottled water though Publix stores announced that it will restock inventory Thursday to keep up with demand.
"It's been like my fifth trip to the store. I've been up since 1:30 this morning getting gas for two vehicles and watching the news," one customer, Karen Exterkamp, told WPLG. "I'm having a hard time getting water, so I'm happy I got that."
Publix limited shoppers to four one-gallon containers of water per person to ensure that every customer received water. Managers said that delivery trucks will be coming to the store Thursday to stock water and other essentials.
Supermarket chain Food Lion also experienced an uptick in customers looking to stock up ahead of the storm. Shoppers are stockpiling items like canned meat, water, charcoal, batteries, bread and ice, spokeswoman Christy told the Charlotte Observer. She added that Food Lion will work closely with its vendors to ensure that essentials are continuously restocked.
"We are providing additional shipments of water, food, batteries and other items to our stores to help ensure product availability for our customers, as well as preparing our stores to minimize any impact from Hurricane Irma," Phillips-Brown said.

Seven first responders filed  a lawsuit Thursday against a chemical company whose Houston-area facility exploded after Hurricane Harvey. The lawsuit against Arkema and three of the company’s executives is seeking over $1 million in monetary relief, and alleges that the company did not adequately warn law enforcement and public health agencies about hazardous materials at the chemical plant. Those allegations come after Arkema and its lobbying group, the American Chemistry Council,  lobbied to kill a federal rule designed to require companies to better coordinate and inform first responders about the toxic compounds at chemical plants. The rule would have taken effect in March.
The EPA’s rule, which included a series of other safety provisions, was ultimately delayed to February 2019 by the Trump administration, with the support of  top Texas Republican lawmakers — many of whom received large campaign donations from the chemical industry.
The suit filed in Harris County court asserts that after explosions at the Arkema’s Crosby plant emitted a cloud of gas, company officials “repeatedly denied that the chemicals were toxic or harmful in any manner to the people, and first responders, in the community.” Yet, the complaint says the fumes sickened the first responders, and charges Arkema with “gross negligence” and “malice.”
“Immediately upon being exposed to the fumes from the explosion, and one by one, the police officers and first responders began to fall ill in the middle of the road,” says the lawsuit, which was filed by members of local agencies including law enforcement and the fire department. “Calls for medics were made, but still no one from Arkema warned of the toxic fumes in the air. Emergency medical personnel arrived on scene, and even before exiting their vehicle, they became overcome by the fumes as well. The scene was nothing less than chaos. Police officers were doubled over vomiting, unable to breathe. Medical personnel, in their attempts to provide assistance to the officers, became overwhelmed and they too began to vomit and gasp for air.”
In a statement, Arkema said its employees did "everything they could to protect the public."
"We reject any suggestion that we failed to warn of the danger of breathing the smoke from the fires at our site, or that we ever misled anyone," the company said. "To the contrary, we pleaded with the public, for their own safety, to respect the 1.5 mile evaucation zone imposed by the unified command well prior to any fire. We will vigorously defend a lawsuit that we believe is gravely mistaken." 
The American Chemistry Council, which counts Arkema as a member, said in a statement to IBT that “industry had significant concerns with many of the modifications because it was not clear that they would improve the safety and security of chemical facilities or neighboring communities.”
The first responders’ complaint concludes that the company did not properly store its chemicals, did not “have adequate procedures in place to protect the safety and welfare of the community in the event of a catastrophe” and failed “to provide the public and first responders accurate information on the chemicals at risk of exploding.”
Company Pushed To Block Rule Requiring More Information Sharing With First Responders
The allegations about information are particularly relevant to Arkema and its lobbying group’s successful effort to kill the EPA’s chemical plant safety rule,  just months before the disaster in Texas.
Under  that rule, which was originally proposed by the Obama administration in 2013 in response to a  deadly explosion at a West, Texas, fertilizer plant, owners of chemical plants would have had to increase coordination with local first responders. In particular, the rule stated companies would have to ensure that “local response organizations are aware of the regulated substances” at plants covered by EPA rules once a year.
Companies, like Arkema, operating plants covered by the laws would have also had to annually disclose to local emergency responders the amounts of the chemicals, the risks from the plant, and the “resources and capabilities at the facility to respond to an accidental release of a regulated substance.”
After several years of development, the EPA finalized the rule in January in the last days of the Obama administration, with final implementation of the rule scheduled for March 14. But after a  petition from a coalition of chemical and fossil fuel companies, as well as years of lobbying, EPA administrator Scott Pruitt delayed implementation of the rule to June 2017, and then delayed implementation again until February 2019.
Plant operators would have had one year to implement parts of the rule that would have improved coordination with local emergency responders. It is unclear whether the first responders who filed the lawsuit Thursday would have had improved knowledge of the toxic chemicals they allege caused them physical injury. However, enactment of the rule would have prompted companies to begin the process of complying with its first responder provisions.
“Never Heeded The Warnings”
The Crosby facility has a  history of safety violations. In 2006, the Texas Commission for Environmental Quality fined Arkema $3,950 for failing to appropriately store a pallet of organic peroxide, which led to a warehouse fire.  In 2011, the company paid a $16,240 penalty for failing to maintain equipment at proper temperatures.
The new lawsuit against Arkema also raises questions about the company’s preparation for natural disasters, arguing that “Arkema, Inc. never heeded the warnings and ignored the foreseeable consequences of failing to prepare” for the kind of storms that regularly hit the Houston area. Indeed, a fter the explosions, Arkema Vice President Daryl Roberts  claimed, “We’ve never experienced anything that would have given us any indication that we could have that much of water.” But in the company’s 2014 Risk Management Plan and a 2013 hazard analysis, Arkema  identified concerns including “equipment failure; loss of cooling, heating, electricity; floods (flood plain); hurricane; other major failure identified: power failure or power surge.”
The company also warned its investors of the risk of chemical explosions in its 2016 annual report, warning that “facilities may be subject to risks of accidents, fires, explosions and pollution due to the very nature of their operations and to the level of hazard, toxicity or flammability of certain raw materials.”
One thing the company may have already prepared for: lawsuits from sickened first responders.
In its  2016 financial filings, the company declared that its operations may “present significant risks to the health or safety of neighboring communities and to the environment” -- and that the company “could be held liable following injury or damage to property or people, notably due to exposure to hazardous substances being used, produced or destroyed” at its facilities.UPDATE 5:42 p.m. —This story was updated to include a statement from Arkema, sent by the company after the story was published. 


Three employees from a Cleveland Taco Bell reportedly opened fire on two armed robbers Wednesday, police said. The restaurant's branch owner, Arthur Giles, claimed the employees killed one of the robbers out of self-defense. 
Two masked assailants entered the restaurant and instructed three works to lie on the floor. However, three additional employees pulled out handguns to protect themselves. The suspect that suffered a fatal injury was shot in the ribs six times, whereas the second suspect managed to run away by foot. No customers or Taco Bell workers were injured from the incident.
"Everyone at the store is okay, from my understanding," Giles told Cleveland.com Wednesday. "All the employees and all the customers are safe."
Members of the Cleveland Police Department's (CPD) Homicide Unit, along with the Cuyahoga County Medical Examiner Office (CCMEO), arrived at the scene. De'Carlo Jackson, 24, was identified as the dead robber. He was reportedly found with a loaded gun in his hand before being transported to MetroHealth hospital, according to Time. His accomplice's identity still remains unknown. 
"Taco Bell and Sigma Bell, LLC., the franchise owner of this Cleveland, Ohio location, are shocked this happened at the restaurant," a Taco Bell media representative told International Business Times Thursday. "Our franchisee is fully cooperating with the Cleveland Police Department in their investigation."
"The employees are very shaken up from yesterday's events, and our franchisee is offering them counseling," Taco Bell added.
The employees who utilized self-defense are said to be two 19-year-old men and a 23-year-old man. No charges or arrests have been made.
"Officers responded to the Taco Bell Restaurant at 1531 W. 117th street on Sept. 6, 2017 at approximately 2:45 a.m. for a robbery with shots fired," the CPD told IBT Thursday. "Upon arrival, one suspect was located on the floor near the counter with multiple gunshot wounds."
"Officers administered first aid until the arrival of EMS. The suspect was conveyed to Metro Hospital where he was later pronounced deceased," CPD added.
The incident is still under further investigation by local law enforcement.
Taco Bell isn't the only restaurant to have an armed robbery experience, but they are among a select few that have employees effectively defend themselves from armed robbers. 
Santucci's Restaurant in Warminster, Pennsylvania, was robbed at gunpoint Sept. 2. An armed, masked man forced staff members into an office and demanded money. The robber took an unknown amount of cash before fleeing the scene. The suspect has not been determined after local law enforcement completed a thorough investigation on the matter. 
Employees and customers were forced by an armed robber to hide in a freezer at Ted's Montana Grill in Columbus, Ohio, Sept. 3. George Higgins, 32, was identified as the robber and arrested by the Columbus Division of Police SWAT. Higgins, a former employee of the restaurant, primarily stole money from a charity the establishment supports called No Kids Hungry, according to WBNS-10TV.

Want a Big Mac, fries and a caramel macchiato? McDonald’s (NYSE: MCD) is making that a possibility.
McDonald’s announced they will be offering a variety of new espresso-based drinks Wednesday, as part of a strengthening of its McCafé brand. McDonald’s will now offer caramel macchiatos, cappuccinos and Americanos as part of its menu. The cappuccinos can be flavored with French Vanilla, caramel or hazelnut. As part of a roll out promotion, the new drinks and all other McCafé drinks will be available for only $2.
The drinks will be in direct competition with Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX), which also offers espresso-based drinks, albeit at a higher price. By comparison, a tall caramel macchiato on average costs $3.95 at Starbucks.
McDonald's launched McCafé in the US in 2009, and it now generates about $4 billion annually in the US, according to Business Insider Wednesday. McCafé will also get a new and cleaner logo.

McDonald’s also released a series of bottled McCafé Frappé drinks in collaboration with Coca-Cola. The drinks will be available in grocery stores and come in three flavors: caramel, vanilla and mocha.
“This is just the start of our McCafé commitment,” said Chris Kempczinski, president of McDonald’s USA, in a statement. “We understand how important the coffee culture is for consumers and we are committed to meeting that demand at the taste, convenience and value only McDonald’s can offer.”
McDonald’s currently stocks are trading at a five-year high.
The bottled drink move comes hot on the heels of a new rollout from Dunkin’ Donuts (NASDAQ: DNKN), which recently began selling bottled drinks at convenience stores and grocery stores. Starbucks began selling a bottled frappuccino drink in 1996, according to USA Today.
The McCafé concept began in Melbourne, Australia in 1993. A licensee opened up a stand-alone coffee shop with the McDonald’s brand. McCafé was the largest coffee shop in Australia and New Zealand by 2003. The U.S. McCafé-brand products are available at most McDonald’s locations.


An incident that spurred an apparent brawl on a Thursday Ryanair flight from England to Spain reportedly continued long after the flight had landed. The carrier said it banned a passenger for life following the initial incident, but a scorned and allegedly intoxicated woman took the fight to baggage claim.
The woman, who was not identified, was reportedly met by police after exiting the flight, British newspaper  Metro reported Tuesday. However a witness, 35-year-old Rachel Burns of Newcastle Upon Tyne, said that authorities at the airport “let [the woman] go” shortly thereafter. Burns said the woman made her way to baggage claim where other passengers were waiting and “that’s when the violence started.”
Video of the scuffle at Alicante Airport in Newcastle shows two women — one in a yellow top and the other in a green top — engaged in a physical altercation, with the woman in a green top straddling the other. The woman in yellow can be seen hitting other passengers in the video of the previous incident.

“I saw her just go up to a lady who had been one of the people telling her to sit down. Then they were going at it on the floor,” Burns told Metro. “It went on for a couple of minutes. She just seemed intoxicated. She was very, very drunk. Some man tried to pull her off, then she started again.”
Burns noted that the woman appeared “very, very drunk.” At one point a man attempted to intervene and pulled the woman off, but then she began getting physical again.
“It was an absolute shambles, the security was shocking. She just left. She was with two friends, they seemed mortified and were crying. Then we left, we just needed to get the children away from it,” Burns added. “It’s shocking that she’d even been able to get on the plane in the first place, let alone get to that point in the airport.”
The incident follows an initial report of the  altercation aboard the flight between the woman in the yellow and several other passengers during which both men and women were seen throwing punches. The brawl occurred shortly before the plane touched down in Alicante.

“It was just as we were about to land when the woman started kicking off,” witness Lucy Norris, 30, of Blyth, Northumberland,  told the Chronicle Live. “She was shouting, screaming and making a show of herself. She had been rude to a few people on the flight and I think she was mortal drunk.”
Burns said the woman sat two rows behind her and became “aggressive” with other passengers on the flight. Burns said the woman asked other passengers, “What you looking at?”
“Then she started fighting with the man in front, and started getting aggressive with the lady asking her to move. The plane staff couldn’t control her,” Burns told Metro. “The people she was attacking got moved to the front of the plane.”
The airline addressed the incident last week in a statement.
“The crew of this flight from Newcastle to Alicante requested police assistance upon arrival after a passenger became disruptive inflight. The aircraft landed normally and the passenger was met by police,” the airline said.
“We will not tolerate unruly or disruptive behaviour at any time and the safety and comfort of our customers, crew and aircraft is our number one priority,” the airline added. “This passenger has been banned from flying with Ryanair and this is now a matter for local police.”


As Floridians waited Wednesday to see whether Hurricane Irma would make landfall in the Sunshine State, reports of price gouging by airlines emerged. Social media users railed against the apparent spike in prices as people attempted to leave Florida before the storm hit.
Price gouging is illegal in Florida at any point in a state of emergency and Gov. Rick Scott declared a state of emergency for all 67 counties Monday as the storm gained strength. But because airlines are regulated by the United States Department of Transportation and the Federal Aviation Administration, ticket prices are not subject to Florida's price gouging laws, according to the Miami Herald. 
Using an incognito Google search window, International Business Times attempted to determine how much it would cost to leave Miami, Florida and surrounding airports on a one-way flight to New York in the coming days.
The cost for flights out of Florida varied Wednesday. Some airlines, like American Airlines, showed prices of up to $1,982 for a one-way ticket. Others, like JetBlue, offered cut rate tickets for those evacuating the area. In many instances, flights were not available at all.
Jet Blue announced that it was offering seats for those in the hurricane’s path at a reduced rate — from $99 to $159. The airline had canceled 150 flights as of Wednesday afternoon and warned that many of the remaining low-cost tickets were sold out.
Delta Airlines was accused of gouging prices Wednesday after a passenger posted a photo showing her flight from Miami to Phoenix was raised from $547.50 to $3,258. A representative for the airline told International Business Times it had “absolutely not been raising prices.” Instead, the representative said, the discrepancy appeared after the traveler tried to book a ticket through expedia.com but was amended when she spoke to Delta directly.
Below are the costs of a one-way economy ticket for from four major airlines.

Fashion conglomerate's LVMH and Kering have teamed up to ban size zero models. The restriction will be applicable to both companies' luxury brands worldwide. Gucci, Christian Dior, Stella McCartney, Marc Jacobs and Balenciaga are among a long list of brands owned by the pair. 
The ban was set in place to support the well-being of female and male models. As leaders in the fashion industry, the groups desire to go the extra mile to implement beneficial change.  
"I am deeply committed to ensuring that the working relationship between LVMH Group brands, agencies and models goes beyond simply complying with the legal requirements," Antoine Arnault, a member of LVMH Board of Directors, said in a press release. "The well-being of models is of great importance to us. As the leader in the luxury sector, we believe it is our role to be at the forefront of this initiative."
"We have the responsibility of building new standards for fashion and we hope to be followed by other players in our sector," Arnault added. 
The charter will require female models to be at least a size 34, which equates to a size 2 in the United States. Male models are required to be a size 44 at a minimum compared to a size 42, respectively. To maintain this regulation, models will have to present a valid medical certificate that was obtained less than six months before a photo shoot or runway show. The medical certificate must depict that the model is of good health. 
Additional restrictions will be applied to models under 16. Brands housed by LVMH and Kering are not permitted to hire young models in shows or shootings to represent adults. Models between 16-18 will not be allowed to work late hours and will need to maintain regular school attendance, among other requirements. 
This new policy is slated to launch at the upcoming respective Fashion Weeks. 
"Through the establishment of this charter and our commitment to abide by its terms, we are once again manifesting the importance of this core value in a very concrete manner," François-Henri Pinault, Chairman and CEO of Kering, said in a press release. "We hope to inspire the entire industry to follow suit, thus making a real difference in the working conditions of fashion models industry-wide."
This announcement comes on the heels of the start of New York Fashion Week (NYFW), which hits the city Thursday. The fashion industry has faced backlash for allowing dangerously thin models to strut along the runways at major fashion shows for NYFW and Paris Fashion Week, among others. 
A study published in the American Journal of Public Health in 2015 examined the thinness of models. Researchers claimed if the United States were to place a regulation on model size, it "would shake the fashion industry, even if enforcement dollars were few and far between. Designers would be hard pressed to maintain a presence in the fashion industry."
Models are at risk for eating disorders, including anorexia nervosa. Many professional models have also died from starvation-related problems. However, over 62 percent of models have been asked to slim down, according to a study produced by Ziff.
Former Australian Vogue Editor Kirstie Clements shared with The Guardian in 2013 the extreme measures she's witnessed models using to maintain thinness. Eating tissues may have been among the more bizarre practices, but cigarettes and Diet Coke proved to be dietary staples. 
A representative from Kering and LVMH did not immediately return International Business Times' request for comment.

Hurricane Irma swirled in the Caribbean seas with winds up to 185 miles per hour, making it a Category 5 storm. As of Wednesday, the storm  was projected to hit Florida this weekend and airlines are canceling flights in preparation for the storm. As a result, the entire system was disrupted. The latest airline woes come just a week after Hurricane Harvey slammed Texas, sending airline carriers reeling.
Cancelations began in the Caribbean earlier this week in anticipation of the storm. Some carriers are adding flights to and from Florida before they are forced to be canceled because of Irma. American Airlines has already canceled all flights to and from their hub in Miami, according to ABC News’ Jeffrey Cook.

Over 80 Wednesday flights both in and out of Luis Munoz Marin International Airport in San Juan, Puerto Rico were canceled. Princess Juliana International Airport in St. Martin, which got hit by Irma Wednesday morning had 28 flights arriving and 30 flights departing from the airport canceled. For Miami, 11 flights in and 16 flights out of the airport have been canceled by Wednesday afternoon. 
Officials warned travelers of extended delays and flight cancelations. Monroe County, Florida, which includes the Florida Keys and the state’s southernmost tip, has been issued a mandatory evacuation.
Some airlines are offering waivers for transfer and rebooking fees for destinations that will be affected by Irma, including Delta, JetBlue, Southwest, United and American, according to the Washington Post.
Airlines have not yet covered from Harvey. There were over 50 cancelations of flights leaving Houston from the William P. Hobby and George W. Bush International airports. Disruptions in fuel refining capabilities in Texas and flight issues have cause jet fuel prices to spike up 20 percent.
The price of airlines tickets had not gone up because of the storm and carriers are adding flights to help with the storm.
“As with all flights, fares are typically more affordable when booked farther out, and may be higher for last-minute original bookings — that fare structure hasn’t changed as a result of the storm,” said Airlines for America,  a trade group that represents major U.S. carrier. 
Flights leaving Miami on Wednesday or Thursday were extremely hard to come by.
President Donald Trump declared an emergency for the state Tuesday and Gov. Rick Scott activated the state’s entire 7,000 person National Guard to be available Friday. Trump also declared emergencies for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.


A Delta Air Lines flight was forced to make an emergency landing this week after one of its engines caught on fire. The incident occurred early Wednesday morning on a flight from Las Vegas to New York. Passengers were delayed several hours after landing at the airport from which they departed less than 30 minutes prior.
Delta Air Lines spokesman Chris Jones  told the Associated Press that the carrier’s pilots declared an emergency immediately after the fire started and successfully landed the Boeing 757 at McCarran International Airport. Passengers reported that the engine burst into flames roughly 15 minutes into the flight,  according to KRON-TV.
FlightAware indicates Flight 1057 departed from Las Vegas at 12:07 a.m., nearly an hour after the flight was initially scheduled to depart. The total flight time listed for the aircraft is 25 minutes, with the plane landing back at the airport around 12:32 a.m. While the AP noted that the replacement flight was scheduled to depart around 6 a.m., it appears it was delayed roughly an hour and didn’t depart until 7:23 a.m.
KRON-TV reported that there were 192 passengers on the first flight out of McCarran International Airport. According to the airline, no injuries were reported during the incident.
“Delta flight 1057 from Las Vegas to New York-JFK International returned to McCarren International after the flight crew received an indication of a possible issue with one of the aircraft’s engines, shortly after departure,” the airline told International Business Times in a statement. “The flight landed without incident and taxied to the gate where customers deplaned normally. The safety of Delta’s customers and crew is always our top priority and we apologize for the inconvenience. Customers were reaccommodated on an alternate aircraft.”

Delta Air Lines saw a similar incident occur in April, when one of its aircraft carrying 227 passengers was forced to return to the Beijing Capital International Airport after one of its engines caught fire shortly after takeoff.
Passengers recounted the incident and described the plane as feeling like it “lost balance,” the  Daily Mail reported at the time.
“It was hard to tell whether it was going up or dropping,” an unnamed woman on the flight said. “Then we heard the captain announcing that we were to turn back.”

A plume of benzene has been detected in the air over Houston after four fossil fuel companies reported leaks of the highly toxic compound that can increase the risk of cancer — even from brief exposure. Documents reviewed by International Business Times show that two of the companies — ExxonMobil and Valero — recently lobbied against an EPA rule to prevent the government from more strictly regulating the toxin, as did a fossil fuel group that counts three of the companies as members. The agency ultimately passed a rule strengthening overall benzene regulations, but after the companies filed critical comment letters, the Obama administration's EPA revised the rule to exempt the companies from those limits during so-called “force majeure” events such as Hurricane Harvey.
“After the comment period closed for the rule, the EPA created some specific exemptions that still allow unlimited releases of toxic pollution during certain time periods,” said Emma Cheuse of Earthjustice, a group that filed a lawsuit to try to remove the new exemptions from the rule. “Those exemptions are really relevant to what we're seeing now. It's likely that refineries will rely on calling this a force majeure incident to avoid sanction. Communities need more protection than just having refineries say this is a force majeure event and having the EPA rubber stamp that.”
Exxon and Valero did not respond to IBT questions about their lobbying on the benzene regulations or preparedness for Hurricane Harvey. Benzene causes a slew of health effects including rapid heart rate, tremors and headaches;  short-term exposure to high levels of the toxin is associated with an increased risk of leukemia.
In 2014, the Obama administration's EPA  proposed a new rule designed to strengthen the requirement for refineries to take corrective action when benzene emissions are detected. The rule was aimed at curbing emissions from companies such as  Valero, ExxonMobil, Shell and Chevron — all of which reported benzene emissions in Texas after Hurricane Harvey, according to state records reviewed by IBT.
In response to the new proposed rule, Valero, ExxonMobil, and the American Petroleum Institute (which represents ExxonMobil, Shell and Chevron) pressed the EPA to back off the benzene regulations.

“The proposed rule will impose significant new burdens on our operations, many of which are justified solely on the basis of improving compliance assurance for hypothetical situations,” said ExxonMobil in an  October 2014 letter to the EPA arguing that the agency’s proposed rules were too strict and would require an additional $2.5 billion investment in safety infrastructure.
The American Petroleum Institute — a lobbying group that counts ExxonMobil, Shell, Chevron and other major oil and gas companies as  members — also sent a  letter to the EPA criticizing the benzene rules, saying the agency “has overstated the risk associated with refinery emissions” and challenging the EPA’s estimates of benzene’s cancer risks.
Valero said the detection of benzene in the air near refineries — a situation faced by the Houston area now —should not automatically trigger corrective action.
“The Proposed Rule should be revised to more explicitly provide that: 1. Short-term, high benzene readings are not actionable, and do not require investigation or response,” Valero declared in an  October 2014 letter to the EPA.
Martyn Smith, a professor of toxicology at University of California-Berkeley, questioned the scientific basis of Valero’s argument against the rule.
“Short-term high benzene exposure can definitely result in harmful health effects,” Smith said in an interview with IBT. “This is because you take in the benzene and you distribute it around your body and it stays in your body for several hours. So I'm not quite sure what the logic behind that is.”
The EPA ultimately opted to enact a benzene rule in 2015. However, after lobbying by Valero, ExxonMobil and API, the EPA rejected calls for a  stricter overall benzene emissions limit. The EPA  said at the time that critics noted the rule sets a benzene limit that is “80-percent higher than the European Union’s standard” and they “urged the agency to consider adopting a stricter standard comparable to what other industrialized nations use.” But the EPA declined the request.
The EPA also revised its final rule to add in exemptions that environmental groups say gives corporations the freedom to emit benzene during emergencies.
“In finalizing new national standards in December, EPA created hazardous malfunction exemptions that give oil companies one or two free passes to pollute uncontrollably every three years, and a complete pass to pollute whenever they lose power or have some other ‘force majeure’ event,” said a  statement from Earthjustice and the Environmental Integrity Project — two groups that filed a lawsuit over the new provisions, which were added by the EPA without allowing public comment on the revisions.
“Force majeure” exemptions apply to events that are unforseen, but at least one of the companies that may invoke those clauses told investors they foresaw problems with flooding. In 2016, ExxonMobil declared in its  financial filings, “Our operations may be disrupted by severe weather events, natural disasters, human error, and similar events,” and has said that “hurricanes may damage our offshore production facilities or coastal refining and petrochemical plants in vulnerable areas.”
Federal records show that  Valero,  API,  Chevron and  Phillips 66 — which shares ownership of the Houston suburb-based Chevron Phillips Chemical with Chevron — lobbied congressional lawmakers on the benzene rule. Disclosure records for  API and  Phillips show that they specifically lobbied the EPA on the rule in 2015 as it was being revised to include the force majeure exemptions.
Valero has consistently lobbied on the rule since it was proposed in 2014, and has employed, among others, a  former senior counsel of the Energy Department to lobby on the issue. Federal records show that the company in 2017 has employed 11 lobbyists who worked in the federal government.
In recent years,  Valero,  Exxon,  Chevron and  Shell settled lawsuits with environmental regulators over emissions of benzene and other toxic compounds. As part of the settlements, the companies had previously agreed to reduce benzene emissions.
“Industry Can Do More To Prevent Emissions”
In the EPA’s 2012  reference summary for benzene, the agency specifically warned that short-term high exposures to benzene can be more of a concern for causing certain illnesses, such as leukemia, writing: "It is important to note that rather than cumulative exposures to low concentrations, it is repeated peak benzene exposures which have been deemed determinative of bone marrow toxicity with a greater potential for leukemia."
Loren Raun, Houston’s chief environmental science officer, told IBT that the city found benzene levels as high as 324 parts per billion Monday in Manchester, an east Houston neighborhood near the Valero refinery, where 37 percent of the population lives  below the poverty line. The Texas Commission for Environmental Quality’s (TCEQ) regulated maximum for short-term benzene exposure is 180 parts per billion. In an interview with IBT, Raun stressed that more measurements are needed before assessing public health effects of the benzene leaks.
Smith, the University of California toxicologist, said he was most concerned with possible “pockets of exposure” where benzene levels might spike, leading to potentially harmful health effects, echoing the EPA’s warning of peak benzene exposures. “I’d become significantly concerned if I saw anything over 100 parts per billion,” he told IBT.
Because of the “force majeure” exemption, communities in East Houston may find that the companies polluting their neighborhoods go unpunished.
"We know that we have people living in close proximity to these facilities,” Bakeyah Nelson, the executive director of Air Alliance Houston, told IBT. “We know that Houston is a hurricane-prone area. We know that industry can do more to prevent emissions. Now the EPA and TCEQ need to require them to do that."


Five nurses from Denver Health Medical Center (DHMC) will be suspended for examining and admiring the size of a dead male patient's genitalia. The nurses viewed the patient's genitalia when he was unconscious, but they also opened the patient's body bag to view parts of his body. The patient was transported to DHMC for an undisclosed medical emergency.
The suspension, which will last three weeks, was confirmed to International Business Times Wednesday by the Denver Police Department (DPD). The hospital staff launched an internal investigation into the incident and was given the task of deciding an adequate punishment for the responsible nurses.
"Multiple staff members viewed the patient while he was incapacitated, including after he was deceased," DPD wrote in a police report. "The complainant, Risk Management for Denver Health, made a mandatory report."
Local law enforcement confirmed the events took place April 3. A report wasn't filed against the participating staff members until May 8. A fellow nurse reportedly overheard the participants making inappropriate comments about their actions, which led her to report the incident to hospital staff. 
"Denver Health responded to this report immediately and the nurses in question were placed on investigatory leave," a representative said in a statement issued to IBT. "Their actions, which violated our policies and our Code of Conduct, were promptly reported to appropriate governmental authorities, including the Denver Police Department and the Colorado State Board of Nursing." 
"Denver Health is truly sorry this happened. This incident it is not an appropriate representation of the high-quality care and compassion our clinical staff strive to provide to our patients," DHMC added.
Two nurses were initially suspended for their participation, but five nurses total were disciplined after the investigation was concluded, according to ABC affiliate KMGH. Four nurses returned to work at DHMC following suspension, but one did not. However, the one that did not return to their post at the hospital was not fired. All participants will have the incident listed on their personnel records. 
No criminal charged were filed against the nurses. Local law enforcement reportedly determined that there was not enough information to file a criminal report against the responsible parties.
The nurses' actions are in direct violation of Denver Health's regulations for employee principals and practices. Such prohibited practices include harassment and unwelcomed sexual advances.
"Denver prohibits all forms of sexual harassment. Unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors and other physical, verbal, or non-verbal conduct of a sexual nature constitute sexual harassment," the manual read.
Denver Health also provides rights to its patients, which the five suspended nurses violated the dead patient's rights during his stay. The organization claims patients will "receive care and treatment that is respectful...[and] personal privacy to the extent possible during the course of treatment." The responsible nurses did not comply.
Failure to report incidents of this caliber could result in punishment or suspension.

UPDATE: Friday, Sept. 22, 2017 at 12:41 p.m. EDT:  Seth Oster, Global Head of Corporate Communications at United Talent Agency, confirmed to the International Business Times that the incident took place as reported.
Original story:
Talent agent Jeremy Barber, who works with a roster of famous clientele, reportedly saved a woman’s life aboard a recent Delta Air Lines flight. The incident occurred on a flight from the from the Telluride Film Festival in Colorado to Los Angeles.
A  witness told Page Six in a report published Tuesday that Barber moved to action after a woman in the row ahead of him began choking. Employing the Heimlich maneuver, which he reportedly hadn’t used since learning it in high school, Barber has able to save the woman from choking to death. The witness told the gossip site that following “five or six tries, it came up.”
“She was about to die. It was not good. People were freaking out,” the witness told Page Six. “[H]e really saved her life.”
The witness said that upon arriving on the flight, Barber had helped the same woman load her luggage into the overhead bin. When the woman confirmed that Barber was indeed the man who had come to her aid not once, but twice, he reportedly joked: “That’s the last thing I’m doing for you on this flight!”
It was clear neither on what day the flight took place nor what the woman had choked on in the report. Seth Oster, Global Head of Corporate Communications at United Talent Agency, confirmed to the International Business Times that the incident took place as reported. Delta declined IBT’s request for comment, citing customer privacy. 
Barber is a partner at United Talent Agency and works with clients who include Greta Gerwig, Don Cheadle, Patrick Dempsey, Steve Coogan, Sigourney Weaver and Justin Theroux,  according to Variety. He was named a partner of UTA in 2009 after being with the company since 2003.
“Jeremy has been an extraordinary asset to UTA in the motion picture department and to the agency overall,” UTA chairman Jim Berkus said.
Barber isn’t the only high profile personality to come to the aid of choking travelers in recent months. Chicago Bears linebacker Jerrell Freeman used the Heimlich maneuver to save a man choking on food at the Austin Airport in July. The man was eating barbecue at a restaurant in the airport at the time of the event, and Freeman noticed something was amiss when the man appeared to be in distress.
“I grabbed him and tried to squeeze the life out of him,”  Freeman told Chicago Tribune at the time. “You’ve got to push in and up. So I did that and he started throwing up what he was choking on. I asked him if he was all right and he shook his head like ‘No!’”

Using machines to read text as a way to enhance understanding of market movements is a topic of intense polarization and debate.
Back in the 90s, work on natural language processing (NLP) involved teams of linguists and computer scientists attempting to code up rules of grammar. Recent work has focused on techniques like word embedding, the underlying idea that a word is characterized by the company it keeps; semantic similarities between words are based on their distribution in large samples of data.

The "bag of words" approach has been applied commercially in finance for more than 10 years. But it can depend on the source of information being analysed: a rule-based approach can work pretty well for news articles that follow certain editorial processes, while social media proves much more challenging.
Tom Doris, CEO at OTAS Technologies, takes a longer view of the technology's potential; he thinks asking an AI how to get better prediction of which stock is going to outperform may be the wrong question. In terms of efficiency, it certainly can be used to quickly reveal things that would take many years' experience and a carefully curated set of information sources to put together.
"What's exciting is we finally have the techniques that can look at entire economies and start to understand where the ebbs and flows are, and anticipate where the potential downturns or the potential resource constraints are going to be in future," he said.
"That's quite different to the hype around social media, which has really been focused on the low latency play and being the first to identify when Carl Icahn tweets something, or when the CEO of a company says something stupid — or the president, for that matter."
Doris, who holds a PhD in computer science, believes Twitter can be useful, but in a more limited domain. He said it doesn't contain the information to answer a lot of the questions that are interesting to traders, and it has proven extremely difficult to extract information from Twitter that eliminates enough of the noise for traders to be interested in it.
"Nothing really works very well with Twitter because basically there just isn't that much information in Twitter," said Doris. "I think where a lot of this stuff falls down – whether it's natural language processing or AI in general – people expect it to be able to extract information where there just fundamentally isn't that much information."
One approach to event trading with Twitter is using a so-called white list, where only verified company or influencer accounts have been used. Taking on the entire Twitter firehose may offer the wisdom of the crowd, but it's extremely noisy and can easily become very expensive from a trading point of view.
However, some experts can demonstrate that Twitter-based indicators substantially outperform the market over extended periods of time. Sentiment analytics company iSentium extracts actionable indictors from large amounts of unstructured social content. It points to independent research commissioned by Nasdaq and carried out by Lucena Research.
Gautham Sastri, CEO of iSentium, emphasized that his company does not use a bag of words approach. "Our team of linguists, led by Dr Anna Maria di Sciullo [post-doc from MIT, Fellow of the Royal Society] all have PhDs and have been working since 2008 to build a system that seeks to understand social media messages in a human-like way.
"If short messages are less valuable because they are brief and to the point, then how does one explain the extensive references in Churchill's History of the Second World War to telegrams that he sent and received? And why were so many resources expended on building the Enigma machine at Bletchley Park?
"I would argue the point that brevity is indeed the soul of wit; and low latency, combined with volume, can provide substantial edge when properly exploited."
Sastri went on to say that his company processes more volume of social content in a second than the entire New York Stock Exchange produces in a day. "For each tweet that we process, we generate 24 different fields that can provide deep insights regarding demography, geolocation, contagion, etc."
Even with replies and hashtags, Twitter is very disparate and lacks a strong sense of topic threading, says Doris. "You'd have much richer content if you looked at the archives of email within a company," he said. "From that you build up a much richer picture about how the different parts of the organisation interact and where the connectivity is and what topics people are discussing.
"For instance, analysis of thread length would tell you whether things are languishing – you just don't have that richness in Twitter. It's been very successful in part because it's so brief and to the point, but that makes it less valuable from an analysis point of view."
Peter Hafez, chief data scientist of big data analytics firm RavenPack, said investors are finding value in Twitter, but not as much as some people might think, and not as much as one you you might find looking at more traditional sources like news. "That said, I believe Twitter may get a second life as the technology knowledge graphs that are applied are becoming more advanced.
"Twitter is more about tracking consumer sentiment than about following the views of prophets. People tweet about the products they like or dislike, what they wish to buy, observed side effects caused by a given drug, etc.
"They don't necessarily tweet about the companies that own the products or a given subsidiary. For example, I might say that I love the new Q5, but I might leave out Audi, the owner of the product; and surely I would leave out Volkswagen, the owner of Audi, which would be the stock that I would have to buy if I wanted to trade the equities markets. You could of course have traded Audi's corporate bonds, skipping the link back to VW; tracking products in a point-in-time fashion is the hard part."
Today internal content is driving the discussion and many financial firms are looking to internal content such as email and instant messages like Slack, instant Bloomberg, Symphony, Skype and more for a competitive advantage.
Hafez added: "More traditional firms have started turning their emails and internal investment notes into actionable data points that can be used more directly within their investment process, basically making internal content more easily accessible within the organisation. It allows deeper understanding of where an organisation has a true competitive advantage over publicly available information."
Returning to a more macro picture of the world, Doris sees NLP technology dovetailing with human discretionary analysis, where the ability to quickly surface information algorithmically will be a fundamental sweet spot.
"It's about what will be the ultimate truths of the macro environment; are interest rates going to change significantly; is the money supply going to change significantly; do we think that there is going to be a significant change in the socio-economic or the global geo-political environment?" he said.
"That's the kind of stuff that you do need a human level of perception to understand whether it's a fad or actually the establishment of a long term trend."
And regarding firms publishing backtests of their signals, Doris pointed out that it's really important to know whether trading costs have been taken into account. "If you don't take into account trading costs, it is trivial to create a 'signal' that always makes money, e.g. by assuming you can instantly trade large volumes of stock whenever the main index future price moves and before the stocks catch up."


Albert Oliver, the founder of concierge services provider One Hundred (it's limited to 100 clients), says that about 30 percent of his wealthy clientele have made money from holding cryptocurrency. However, he has encountered a problem, as have his clients, should they decide they want to cash out their digital gains:  No bank will touch large amounts of cash exchanged for cryptocurrency.
"These people are typically early adopters, with a few investments in stock and shares and some other bits and pieces, who fancied a punt on Bitcoin," he said. "They may have stuck a few thousand in and even forgotten about it."
Newsweek is hosting an AI and Data Science in Capital Markets conference on December 6-7 in New York.  Photo: NewsweekMediaGroup
"We've got clients that are British citizens with U.K. bank accounts, with money stuck in Kraken or somewhere like that, and then want to bring it back into a U.K. bank account. But the banks are like, 'We're not touching it.'"
This has meant exploring banks in other jurisdictions, and generally feeling like money launderers, despite having done nothing wrong. "One client wants to use the million pounds he's made to buy a house," said Oliver, "but he can't get his money out."
Perhaps his client would be interested in a new, luxury property opportunity, open to holders of Bitcoin, being launched September 6.
Baroness Michelle Mone of Mayfair OBE and her business (and life) partner Doug Barrowman, the chairman of the Knox Group of Companies, have unveiled a luxury apartment complex called Aston Plaza in the heart of Dubai. You can buy one of these apartments directly with your Bitcoin, facilitated by BitPay, the well-known Bitcoin payments processor.
The $325 million development includes a large shopping mall and spans over 2.4 million square feet, split across two 40-story residential towers, containing 1,133 apartments.
Michelle Mone Interiors, another new venture, has handled much of the design, and Bitcoin can also be used to select a tailor-made interior package. Studio apartments will start in price from around 30 BTC, said a statement.
"Apartments have been sold before using Bitcoin, I believe, but there's never been a development on this sort of scale – £250million sold using Bitcoin. It's very exciting," Baroness Mone said.

Barrowman, who has been investing in cryptocurrency and tokens for the past two years, said: "People are sitting on large gains that have been made in the crypto world over the last few years. So it's a great opportunity to turn it into a physical asset."
BitPay converts Bitcoins to U.S. dollars that are then transferred to the property development company in Dubai and held in an escrow account until completion. In terms of tax, there is a 4 percent land registry fee payable on purchase, said Barrowman.
"We have a dollar value for each of these apartments (dollars are pegged to Dubai dirhams, so it all fits in beautifully) and on the day on which they purchase it, we look at where Bitcoin is. BitPay will take care of the transactional side of it, but essentially the process in Dubai will be a conventional conveyancing process."
According to Coindesk's State of the Blockchain report, assets like real estate are returning about 9 percent, while cryptocurencies and tokens average at about 450 percent, suggesting you'd have to be mad to diversify.
Baroness Mone rightly pointed out that the crypto world is very volatile; the recent ICO ban from China wiped billions off the value of cryptocurrency tokens, for example.  "I think if you buy one of these apartments it's something you can touch, something you can have," she said. "We see big swings on a daily basis and who knows what might happen to Bitcoin in the future; no one quite knows. So this is an opportunity to put it into a hard backed asset."
A recent report by a Transparency International pointed out that buying property in places like London is a favorite way to launder squillions of dirty dollars. Given the perception around Bitcoin, this would seem to wave a rather large anti-money laundering (AML) flag.
On the subject of regulation, Barrowman pointed out that while Bitcoin is currently unregulated in most parts of the world, it's only really pseudonymous and actually leaves an indelible audit trail. "The reality is we are in an evolving world when it comes to cryptocurrency regulation. I think in three years' time it will be more heavily regulated," he said.
"The Isle of Man has the Designated Business Act so you have to know your client [KYC], source of funds, AML laws and that's only going to increase."

Timo Dijkstra, compliance director at BitPay has handled AML and KYC on large Bitcoin purchase transactions in the past, including boats and the occasional holiday home in Lake Tahoe.
He said that in terms of KYC, BitPay's primary role is to check out the merchant, Knox Group in this case. "We perform the due diligence on them. We make sure that we know that customer; that we know they have a good process in place; that they are dealing with all the legal and compliance aspects of their business," Dijkstra said.
"The other counterparty risk is really the responsibility of the merchant because it's their customer. But we also check that regularly. So when a high transaction goes through, we check the KYC documents for that transaction and ask what other checks were done. We look at the purpose of this transaction and what was the source of the funds.
"That's the traditional side. But with Bitcoin every transaction is recorded on a public ledger so everybody can see it. So we use blockchain analysis to make sure the incoming transaction is not linked in any way to nefarious sources, such as dark markets or related to ransomware for example," said Dijkstra.
"So that's the check we can do on our end to make sure that when someone is buying a house they didn't make that money with selling illegal goods or something like that."
Pawel Kuskowsk, iCEO of Coinfirm, which specializes in crypto compliance and analytics, echoed this, pointing out that because Bitcoin is decentralized and you don't have a bank in the middle, you carry the peer-to-peer risk exposure.
"So it's one party's job to understand who the counterparty is. The second part is, what is the risk associated with the source of funds.
"Maybe you do a check and it appears to be some person, an individual, who maybe bought some Bitcoin years ago and forgot about it, or didn't expect the value to go up so high, and now they want to buy a house. But in reality they have just hacked an exchange, or maybe it's not an individual at all, but money coming from ransomware."
Kuskowski said that while most cryptocurrency holders are legitimate businesses, out of every ten crypto transactions, about one will have come from questionable sources. He said there are about 200 different red flags in his system highlighting risky sources and exposures.
"If you want to accept new ways of payment, you need to manage the risk associated. There is no way you can cut the corners here. But there are tools out there; it's not rocket science."
Another approach to KYC is simply ensuring you know your customers really well. This is the approach being taken by Eleesa Dadiani, owner of Dadiani Fine Art Gallery in London, who recently started accepting cryptocurrencies to pay for art.

Now she is about to launch Dadiani Syndicate, which will provide a whole range of very high luxury products that can be bought with crypto, including central London property, supercars, diamonds and bloodstocks.
Regarding KYC for her new venture, Dadiani said: "These people are not strangers. I need to know my clients personally. This is a really hyper-personalised service; it's a small line-up, definitely not an ecommerce site."
Dadiani is travelling to places like Singapore and China, in part to educate her clients about cryptocurrency, new tokens and the technology that underpins various use cases. She said there has been quite a bit of interest from her network of contacts in the U.S. and India; initially, she was targeting Russia.
She said: "We are the first platform in the U.K. that will trade bloodstock in cryptocurrency. The particular bloodstock fund I work with enjoys 40 percent returns; it's a very unusual structure they have got there. It's a passion investment as well as a practical one. Maybe in time we can convince some of our dealers to accept crypto and sit on it."
This perhaps touches on an obstacle facing any business offering people the chance convert their cryptocurrency into other assets. Because even in a crashing crypto bear market – what do you do? Those familiar with the expression 'I AM HODLING' know there's only one answer to that question.

Update — Tuesday, Sept. 6 at 1:06 p.m. EDT:  After the story was published, a rep for Delta responded to International Business Times’ request for comment. The airline did not raise any prices because of the storm. “We have absolutely not been raising prices,” the rep said.
The discrepancy apparently happened after the traveler, Leigh Dow, tried to book her ticket through Expedia.com. When she spoke with Delta directly, they fixed the problem. “She was satisfied with the fare she got,” the rep said.
Moving forward, Delta encouraged anyone who wants to book a flight with their airline to go to Delta.com directly. They added extra flights from Florida and the south Caribbean to accommodate people who want to evacuate because of Hurricane Imra.
If passengers need to alter their travel plans, they will not be charged a fee because of the storm. “In addition to the waiver, the fares are stable and we have not increased them at all,” the rep said.
Finally, the rep noted Delta Air Lines has a partnership with the Red Cross “and we’re working with them to provide relief. We’re very active in those efforts,” the spokesperson said.
Original story:
Delta's in trouble again.
The airline was accused of “jacking” up the price of one of their flights nearly 600 percent after a traveler tried to book a flight out of Miami in the midst of Hurricane Irma Tuesday. Leigh Dow, a public relations executive, was trying to safely evacuate from the hurricane area and not pleased with the price gouging. She took to Twitter to vent her discontent to her nearly 19,000 followers.
Dow posted a screenshot of the price change. The photo showed her flight from Miami to Phoenix was raised from $547.50 to $3,258.50. “Jacking from $547 to over $3200 for people trying to evacuate responsibly?”
Shame on you @delta. Jacking from $547 to over $3200 for people trying to evacute responsibly? #IrmaHurricane pic.twitter.com/O2nfPHQUAh
— Leigh (@LeighDow) September 5, 2017
While talking to her followers, Dow said the flights out of Miami were apparently sold out. “I think they are probably sold out at this point. Seems to be the case across the industry,” she wrote when someone suggested she take another airline.
The post soon went viral on Twitter, garnering more than 30,000 reactions over 23,000 shares. Hundreds of people started to comment on Dow’s post. They slammed Delta.
They shud be fuckn free. They should be sending planes from everywhere to get these people this is sad.

— Falcon Travis (@TravisSelvidge) September 6, 2017
Delta soon responded to Dow to try to make amends. “Leigh, can you please message me more details regarding this! I would love to try and help,” the airline wrote.
Less than a half hour later, Delta helped Dow find a solution.
“The @Delta team explained how it happened, and another airline was also involved. That wasn't obvious to me. They intervened & helped us out,” she wrote. “.@Delta reached out & helped tremendously. Note to travelers, always call airline directly if something doesn't look right.#IrmaHurricane.”
International Business Times reached out to Delta for a statement, but did not immediately hear back.

The latest phase of the Utility Settlement Coin project, which aims to settle trades with a token linked to accounts at central banks, has seen the consortium expand.
Barclays, CIBC, Credit Suisse, HSBC, MUFG and State Street are the latest participants; the project began life with UBS and the other early stage members are BNY Mellon, Deutsche Bank, Santander, NEX. The technology is being built by UK-based start-up Clearmatics.

This third phase of the project is expected to run for about 12 months. Following that we can expect to see the first live collateralised token exchange using the platform, which could occur as soon as the end of 2018, according to Hyder Jaffrey, UBS director of strategic investment and fintech innovation.
Not much has been said about the technology underlying the USC project. Robert Sams, Clearmatics CEO, who favours blockchain technology inspired by Ethereum for the Cleamatics decentralised clearing system, confirmed USC is built on something similar. "It's an Ethereum-like architecture rather than UTXO/Bitcoin-like," he said in an email. Asked if it would comprise a single monolithic chain or a series of cross-connected chains, he explained: "Multiple chains. We will be making some announcements about our approach to interoperability in due course. It will be based on open standards and open source implementations."
Privacy is a big problem for industrial-grade blockchains that handle sensitive information. Clearmatics has leveraged ring signatures to develop a privacy solution called Mobius. Ring signatures are a type of zero knowledge proof for set membership, often associated with things like anonymous voting and whistleblowing.
At a recent Enterprise Ethereum Alliance meet-up, Clearmatics blockchain engineer Matthew Di Ferrante explained how Mobius could be used for payments. He pointed out that it has less in the way of untested cryptographic assumptions than zk-SNARKs and less computational overhead. It can handle tens of thousands of transactions a second, he said.
It is interesting that USC is being developed at the same time as CLS is developing CLSNet, a new automated payments netting service for FX trades based on the Hyperledger Fabric distributed ledger platform. It is clear that regulators and central banks are entertaining the idea of new peer-to-peer infrastructure, including as new services operated by market infrastructure incumbents.
One of the new banks to join USC is Barclays. Dr Lee Braine of Barclays Investment Bank's CTO Office reiterated that Barclays had just joined the USC project and so would begin its architectural reviews of aspects such as data privacy, scalability, interoperability with existing infrastructure, etc.
He said that as well as potential benefits with capital efficiency and risk reduction based around shortening the settlement life cycle, there may also be broader gains from an industry architecture perspective. "The current capital markets ecosystem comprises a highly complex technological landscape with many different systems interacting via many different data feeds. A proportion of the industry processes in place are effectively workarounds to support the fact that there often isn't instant settlement finality. The innovative thinking is that, if you could have a utility token permitting settlement finality, then you may also be able to simplify that ecosystem in order to reduce costs and reduce risk."
The use case roadmap for USC is likely to start with payments and then add other transactions in the longer term.
"The potential value obtained from such utility tokens could eventually be broadened and extended by going beyond payments to also include more complex transaction types where you are looking for an atomic swap of different asset classes," added Braine.
"A good example would be delivery versus payment (DvP), where one leg of the transaction could potentially be the payment as a USC token denominated in a particular currency, and the other leg could be the security. Additional benefits are likely to accrue when both legs can settle instantly with finality, as opposed to just one leg - the payment - and the other leg taking longer."
Harder challenges could include efficient multi-party netting on a blockchain and perhaps even the use of utility token by clearing houses. However, Braine pointed out that efficient securities netting would remain a challenge for distributed ledger technology (DLT) in general for some time to come. He explained: "Remember that no single netting solution is perfect for all scenarios, with one example reason being the unavoidable trade-off between settlement frequency and settlement efficiency."
Braine said that while some have proposed that efficient securities netting could be performed in a completely decentralised manner, he remains sceptical. "I think for certain netting optimisations, you need to effectively temporarily centralise an aspect of the algorithm in order to perform the equivalent of a batch exercise. That's not necessarily incompatible with a distributed ledger, it just means you may need to pass control to a trusted entity for a short while – whether that's a broadly-trusted node on the distributed ledger or perhaps a trusted oracle."
Regarding blockchains and digital currency, the central banking world has been quite vocal. There has been research by the Bank of England (including some work in association with UCL), Bank of Canada, MAS for Singapore, while the People's Bank of China has opened a Digital Currency Research Institute.
But despite this enthusiasm, issuing a central bank digital currency would probably take years to happen, and so something like the USC, which is focused on major currencies, has the potential to be deployed in the meantime.
But of course to move this project forward may mean loosening a Gordian Knot: a whole layering of agreements, whether they be network agreements, counterparty agreements, and jurisdictions under which these agreements are governed and supervised by regulators.
Peter Randall, CEO of rival blockchain settlement solution SETL, queried: "Would a deposit in the name of a USC account at a central bank be sufficient for global regulators to agree that any bank using this route would be allowed to relax the capital treatment of their obligations towards each other by an equal and opposite amount?"


Lego can't build itself out every dilemma.
The famed toymaker announced Tuesday it would cut 1,400 jobs before the end of 2017. The job cuts, which equates to 8 percent of the company's employee roster, are a result of a drop in profit and sales accumulated through the first half of the year.
The Danish family-owned company's revenue has fallen by 5 percent. Lego's operating profit is reportedly down by 6 percent and its net profit decreased by 3 percent. The toymaker's total revenue also declined by 5 percent, which doesn't compare to the Lego's earnings from the first half of 2016.
"We are losing momentum and productivity — and it's a warning light of declining competitiveness and thus adaptability," a representative from the Lego Group told International Business Times Tuesday. "Ultimately, this can lead to stagnation or even a decline. We cannot allow this to happen.
"We are already taking steps to regain momentum in markets like the U.S. and Europe and will work with our partners to do this. This is however not a quick fix, and may take a few years to materialize," the company added.
"We have added complexity into the organization which now, in turn, makes it harder for us to grow further," Lego chairman Jorgen Vig Knudstorp said in a press release. "As a result, we have now pressed the reset-button for the entire Group.
"We are working closely with our partners and we are confident that we have the long-term potential of reaching more children in our well-established markets in Europe and the United States. We also see strong growth opportunities in growing markets such as China." 
Lego's decision to create a smaller business and organization will ultimately simplify its business model. The European toymaker believes this will, in turn, help the company to better reach its target market.
All terminated employees will receive a severance package. The package will include job transition to a position outside the company, among other unlisted benefits.
Niels Christiansen officially becomes CEO on Oct. 1, replacing interim CEO Bali Padda.
Lego, which is owned by the Kirk Kristiansen family, began making wooden toys in 1932. The company's most recognizable product is the red Lego brick, which was first unveiled in 1958. However, the toymaker came under pressure to keep with the times as electronic toys became a hot commodity. 
Lego hasn't experienced an annual revenue setback in 13 years.

An American Airlines flight to Seattle was forced to return to Miami International Airport on Friday after the plane was struck by lightning, according to reports. Several other flights were reportedly grounded the same evening as a result of inclement weather.
“The flight landed safely, we swapped to a new aircraft, and the flight re-departed,” the airline told International Business Times in a brief statement Tuesday. American Airlines added that aircraft are engineered to be resistant to lightning strikes.
Marc Henderson, a spokesperson for Miami International Airport,  told ABC-affiliate WPLG no passengers were hurt during the incident. According to the news outlet, “Miami-Dade Fire Rescue was prepared for a hazardous situation, but Henderson said they were only there as a precaution.”

http://www.nbcmiami.com/portableplayer/?cmsID=442525753&amp;videoID=jCJlTa4e3CNT&amp;origin=nbcmiami.com&amp;sec=news&amp;subsec=local&amp;fullWidth=y ">
According to  Boeing’s website, lightning strikes to aircraft are relatively common. While damage to planes is rare, Boeing notes that “the result can range from no damage to serious damage that requires extensive repairs that can take the airplane out of service for an extended period of time.”
“The frequency of lightning strikes that an airplane experiences is affected by several factors, including the geographic area where the airplane operates and how often the airplane passes through takeoff and landing altitudes, which is where lightning activity is most prevalent,” the website noted.
In terms of frequently, the  Scientific American reported in 2001 that each craft in the United States commercial fleet is hit by lightning more than one a year without any significant incident. The report went on to note that the last confirmed incident in which a plane crashed after being struck by lightning occurred in 1967, when a lightning bolt struck an aircraft and caused a fuel tank explosion.
But modern flyers needed worry, experts say.
“Airplanes have been designed for years to deal with lightning strikes pretty well,” William Voss, the president and CEO of the Flight Safety Foundation,  told CNN in 2010. “Since the 1930s, it's been clearly understood that aircraft will be subjected to lightning strikes, so they're sort of designed to take it.”
Voss added: “[T]hey do it by basically making sure there's a conductive path so that the lightning runs around the skin of the aircraft. It is dissipated out safely through points that have static wicks [antenna-like devices on wingtips] and so on, things that help the electricity flow around the aircraft and back out to the atmosphere.”

An airline is now apologizing to a disabled man whose wheelchair was destroyed while traveling with the carrier. Andy Latham and his wife, Kerry Latham, claim that the specialized wheelchair was severely damaged while being loaded onto their Ryanair flight from Birmingham Airport in England.
The airline told International Business Times in a brief statement Tuesday that its service representatives were working with the couple to get the issue resolved.
“We regret any inconvenience caused by our handling agents (Swissport) at Birmingham Airport, and our customer service team are liaising with this customer to resolve this matter directly,” the airline said.
Andy Latham was partially paralyzed two years ago after suffering a brain hemorrhage,  BBC News reported Sunday. The Warwickshire-based couple was headed for Alicante, Spain, for vacation at the time of the incident. Andy Latham’s custom-made wheelchair, on which he is dependent, was reportedly destroyed while being loaded onto the plane as the two were en route to their destination.

“Andy depends on the wheelchair, so of course I’m feeling upset to see his wheelchair in pieces,” Kerry Latham told BBC News.
The couple said they spent hundreds of euros during their vacation to secure a wheelchair. Kerry Latham also said that they were contacted by the airline while they were in Spain at their UK phone number, meaning that they weren’t able to take the calls. Ryanair also reportedly sent an email to the couple apologizing for the handling of the chair. But Kerry Latham said she’s been having to “chase” both the carrier and Swissport to get a resolution.
“Somebody needs to replace the wheelchair,” Kerry Latham said.
It could take up to three months for Andy Latham to receive another chair that suits his medical needs, but the couple is renting one in the meantime.
Ryanair came under fire earlier this year for its customer service provided to another wheelchair-dependant customer. A 20-year-old student with Friedreich's Ataxia was left at a Dublin airport after being detained because of her chair and was allegedly asked to walk up stairs “for easiness’ sake.”
“I thought, how dare they ask a person in a wheelchair that question?”  Niamh Herbert told the Guardian in February.
She added: “I was visibly distraught and a few people in the airport came up to me, asked me if they could help or buy me tea, but Ryanair staff barely spoke to me.”
“While we regret any inconvenience, this customer arrived at the boarding gate 13 minutes before the flight was due to depart and had not booked any wheelchair services,” Ryanair later said in a statement. “Our crew provided full assistance and as a gesture of goodwill, transferred this customer on to the next available flight, free of charge, and the customer flew to London Stansted. Had this customer booked wheelchair assistance and arrived at the boarding gate on time, there would have been no issue.”


An American Airlines Boeing 767 made an emergency landing Monday at Norfolk International Airport (ORF) in Norfolk, Virginia, due to the aircraft's mechanical errors. No injuries were sustained by its 192 passengers crew members upon landing.
An electrical odor was detected on the aircraft of Flight 235. This caused the airline crew to plan for an unscheduled stop. The flight was heading to Miami International Airport from John F. Kennedy International Airport. 
"The flight diverted due to a mechanical issue," Rob Feinstein, an American Airlines press representative, told International Business Times Tuesday. "The flight landed safely and taxied to the gate. Passengers were accommodated on another aircraft to Miami."
"On Monday, American Airlines flight #235, a Boeing 767 from JFK to Miami, diverted to Norfolk, VA after the pilot reported smelling smoke in the cockpit. The aircraft landed without further incident," a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) representative told IBT Tuesday.
There was no presence of smoke or fire on the plane despite the smell, said American Airlines spokesperson Katie Cody, according to Nexstar Broadcasting affiliate WAVY-TV.
American Airlines isn't the first carrier to encounter a questionable odor on its aircraft. United Airlines experienced a similar electrical odor issue in July 2014 on a flight heading from Guam from Honolulu. Approximately 335 passengers and 13 airline employees were deserted on a remote Midway Island for seven hours. David Soucie, a former FAA inspector and CNN safety analyst, explained what leads to mechanical incidents like this on CNN's "New Day."
"It's actually ozone," Soucie told the show's hosts. "Extended exposure can be harmful to your lungs, your mouth. It can make you very irritated."
Airline passengers who have experienced ozone's odor have equated it to smoke or burning. These mechanical errors occur by arcing, which is defined as the movement between two electrodes caused by electrical currents in the air. Arcing can also occur in nature through lightning. Failure, like an internal short, within an aircraft's fan could potentially create sparks. This, in turn, would lead to the smoky ozone smell. 
Flight delays, like the issue of American Airlines Flight 235, are a common problem passengers may endure. However, airlines can't and don't guarantee flight arrival schedules because unanticipated delays can occur that are out of a carrier's control. This causes airlines to make emergency defers because of mechanical malfunctions or other common complications. 
Compensation for customers experiencing extensive delays is not a requirement that airlines have to follow. This, in part, is due to the lack of government regulation.
"Each airline has its own policies about what it will do for delayed passengers waiting at the airport; there are no federal requirements," the U.S. Department of Transportation (USDT) wrote on its website. "Some airlines, often those charging very low fares, do not provide any amenities to stranded passengers. Others may not offer amenities if the delay is caused by bad weather or something else beyond the airline's control."
"Compensation is required by law on domestic trips only when you are 'bumped' from a flight that is oversold. On international itineraries, passengers may be able to recover reimbursement under Article 19 of the Montreal Convention for expenses," USDT added.

The old story of the American Dream is pretty straightforward: You work hard in school, develop skills and then get a job that provides decent wages and solid benefits. It was a dream that was actually realized by millions of people a generation or two ago — but journalist Rick Wartzman says the dream is increasingly out of reach because of a radically altered relationship between employers and employees, and also because of the new  supremacy of shareholders over community stakeholders.
Wartzman is a former Wall Street Journal reporter whose new book is called “The End of Loyalty: The Rise and Fall of Good Jobs In America.” In a podcast interview with International Business Times, he discussed how huge corporations once took responsibility for providing for their workers and retirees. But over the last 30 or 40 years, he argues, the fundamental relationship between companies and their workers changed in a way that began prioritizing shareholder returns and corporate profits over everything else.
Subscribers can click here to listen to the whole podcast. What follows is an excerpt of the discussion.
What was the typical experience for workers at major corporations in the mid-20th century – and how does that differ from today?
The experience was much different than today fundamentally in this way — or these ways, I should say. Job security was much stronger than today even down to folks on the front lines. Pay was rising and it rose markedly from the late 1940's, mid-to-late 40's after World War II, all the way up until the early 70's. And benefits were rising as well where there was a very small percentage, 15 percent, 20 percent of workers who had basic healthcare coverage, for example, in the late 40's that would rise to over 70 percent by the early 70's. Pension coverage, there were actually things called pensions back then where people were guaranteed a set amount of income after they retired for all of their days.
In many ways, to me, that was the fullest expression of the social contract between employer and employee. It was built on this expectation of lifelong loyalty between the parties. About half of the American workforce would end up with a defined benefit pension plan. In terms of your pocketbook issues, corporate America had created this kind of private welfare state almost where they really took good care of you.
In providing better wages and benefits to workers, were corporate CEOs just nicer back then? Or were they forced to provide those better wages and benefits  because unions were stronger a few generations ago? 
I wouldn't say CEOs were nicer. I don't think they were nicer, but I do think that there was an important element of culture writ large that played a very important role coming out of the Depression and World War II. There was definitely more of a "we" culture in American society than an "I" culture. And CEOs did talk much more explicitly about needing to balance the interest of all of their stakeholders, not just take care of their shareholders.
There really was a different ethic at that time, and I think that corporate cultural norms reflected and reinforced these bigger societal norm. I think that was an element but you are absolutely right. I spent a lot of time early in the book talking about the role of unions, of organized labor. Jim Carey from the electrical workers and Walter Reuther from the autoworkers are major figures in my narrative because just as you say, a lot of the pay and benefits were hard won and hard fought for, often with blood spilled by unions.
I think the lesson there is that at that time and rising up through the 50's — when about 25 percent to 35 percent of the private sector workforce in America carries a union card —  there was enough of a countervailing power to make a difference not only for those in unions but there was, well-documented by scholars, this tremendous spillover effect to the rest of the economy. Other blue collar workers saw their pay and benefits rise by the gains won at the bargaining table through these big industrial unions.
And even white collar workers, often their benefits were patterned after what the unions were able to win. Unions very much helped to forge the social contract and lift all boats. Now, when we're at a point where less than 7 percent of the private sector workforce is a unionized. There just isn't that countervailing power and there's no longer that spillover effect that helps lift up everybody.
Henry Ford was famous for promoting the idea that its good to pay workers well so they can buy your company’s product. That doesn’t seem to be the corporate ideology today. When and how did that change?
This idea is the virtuous cycle that Henry Ford famously kicked off in some ways — at least symbolically — by raising his workers' wages from a dollar a day to $5 a day overnight. Lo and behold, suddenly, they could afford to buy cars. They could buy Fords. That was a very common sentiment among top business executives through the 40's and 50's and even into the 60's. There's a quote in my book from Charlie Wilson, the president of General Electric, who says, "How are they going to buy my refrigerators if I don't give them good enough wages do it with?"
They got this idea and again, you look at today. Some like Larry Summers are warning about secular stagnation, meaning we just may not be paying across the economy workers enough with wages flat for decades on in for 80 percent of the workforce. We may be not putting enough dough in their pockets to keep the economy humming, so there is real concern. What got lost between then and now, the great shift, I think, they're all kinds of forces that change the social contract.
Automation and technology, globalization and trade with low wage competitors around the world, the shift from blue collar work where you could get a job with a high school degree or even less: hard, backbreaking work, often dirty. But it put you on a path to the middle class. You could make decent money and have health and retirement security. The fracturing of jobs into temp work and all those things. There are a lot of big forces that have happened over the decades.
But the real philosophical shift was going from that stakeholder model that I spoke of, balancing the interest of all stakeholders. Shareholders, yes, but workers and customers and communities you operated in. And again, CEOs talked about that very explicitly to going by really the mid 70's and then the kicking off really in the 80's and through the 90's and accelerating to today, a very different model where now, it's all about maximizing shareholder value. Companies have decided very explicitly to put investors above all those other stakeholder groups, and when you do that, it's just a matter of math. Workers don't fare as well.
Were there some key moments and key people that hastened the shift you are describing?
Yeah. There were some. One, a lot of the weaknesses in American business were exposed by the recession in the early 70's that are actually back-to-back recessions. It was the period of stagflation, this incredible, double wallop of high unemployment and high inflation that would kick in and really plague the country for quite a long time. That's sort of signaled that, again, the American corporation would no longer be as dominant as it was on the world stage and that was certainly a hastening factor. A lot of people mark 1973 and the recession then and the oil crisis in a period where productivity began to decline and wages for the first time in real terms began to decline, as an important marker.
The other one was in terms of the philosophical shift that accompanied this was two things. Milton Friedman, the famous University of Chicago economist, who wrote a very famous piece in 1970 in the New York Times magazine where he laid out that the social responsibility, his words, of a business was only one — and that was for executives to act as the agents of the shareholders and to do their bidding and to do the one thing they cared about, and he said that was to make as much money as possible. He said that for an executive to do anything else was, he very explicitly said to try and create more employment, that that was pure and unadulterated socialism, I think were the exact words that he used in the piece.
Friedman started to give intellectual cover to investors and to business leaders to shift from this stakeholder model to this maximizing shareholder value model. That was then picked up by a large group of academics on the business side. Most importantly, there was a paper written in 1976 by Michael Jensen and William Meckling then at the University of Rochester School of Management. Jensen became the biggest proponent of this agency theory as it's called, that managers need to be the agents of the shareholders. That's their job. He went on to Harvard and they wrote a paper, Jensen and Meckling, that became the most cited academic business paper of all time. Again, that was its theme, that maximizing shareholder value was the thing for executives to do.
What about the role of technology and automation — how has that changed the social contract between workers and employers? 
I think of technology in two ways. One is just automation so that is something that's been accelerating over, obviously, human history but in sort of the context of the story arc I'm talking about. Certainly, since the 1950's, by the mid to late 50's, companies like General Electric were automating factories as well as their back office operations and putting in these giant computer systems.
We tend to think that America doesn't manufacture anything anymore. It's not true. Industrial output is actually higher than it was in the 50's. It just takes a lot fewer hands to do it. We don't need that many people. In some ways, it's analogous to what happened in agriculture. We produced a lot of food but how many farmers do you know? Most of it has been automated. So, one Fed study said that what took a thousand people to make in the 1950's, now takes somewhere between 150 and 200, and that's only increasing today; there's just not that many people around. You look at pictures of factories in the 1950's, they're full of people doing stuff.
That's had a huge impact, and again, sort of hastened the shift. If you're lucky enough and you can afford to have a good education and you get some skills, you become a knowledge worker and you can by and large do pretty well in this economy. But kind of their poor cousins or low wage service workers, we've kind of taken away these jobs in the middle. A lot of talk of economists is the hollowing out of the middle and that's what they're talking about.
Then, the other technological piece is very much, as you talk about, is that it has allowed companies to effectively extend their reach to overseas to the cheapest labor markets that there are. There's a book, it's academic. Richard Baldwin wrote it, "The Great Convergence," where he sees that only accelerate, that lots of things will be able to be done very, very cheaply because we can zip information around all over the place and go where the labor is cheapest.
Is Silicon Valley playing a positive or negative role for workers in the 21st century? 
To me, Silicon Valley is emblematic of exactly the split that I'm talking about. At one end, you have these incredibly well-compensated jobs for knowledge workers, coders, engineers, data scientists. You work at Google and if you're an employee there, life is sweet. It's good. You can get, what, a Foosball table in your office and get free sushi and stuff. It's fantastic. But there's this whole other part of the economy there which is the fastest growing part.
That part in the former camp, I think the average wage, depending what data you look at, but it's $120,000 a year or something like that. They're good jobs. At the other end are jobs were people are making on average about $20,000 a year in a very expensive place to live and these are mostly temp jobs or gig work, independent contractors. They're 1099 employees, not W2 employees; 1099 workers and they have no benefits, so I say their pay is terrible. They are mostly Black and Latino and these are the people who are the shuttle bus drivers and the groundskeepers and the janitors and the security guards, often at very big high-tech headquarter complexes, some of which are now being built. New ones are springing up all over that region. You have this just tremendous divide between those on the high end and those on the low end…
The other important thing is on that high end, there's just not that many jobs that are created. Again, they're terrific jobs but the BLS [Bureau of Labor Statistics] data suggests there's something like a million software developers in the U.S. There are many times more that fast food workers and janitors and home healthcare aides who all of whom make less than $25,000 a year. Those knowledge worker jobs are great but Silicon Valley just doesn't create that many jobs.
What do you think can be done to rebuild a stronger social contract between employers and employees — one that is better for workers? 
One thing I think we need to do is create portable benefits for those independent workers. I don't want to overblow this. Those in this kind of contingent jobs and this would include temp workers as well as independent contractors and on-call contract workers and so on, it's really about your very inflated numbers that's half the workforce and things like that. It's really not, depending on how you measure it. It's somewhere between 15 percent or 16 percent of the workforce. Those are the best numbers that I've seen…
It goes up to maybe 30 percent or 35 percent of the workforce if you include people who have a regular job but then, work at least once a week in some kind of, drive an Uber, whatever, on the side regularly to make ends meet. We need to increase benefits for them, portable benefits that people can take from gig to gig. And there are some interesting, at this point unfortunately small, kind of nods in that direction in New York State and Washington State but it's not nearly enough going on.
We need to really make sure we're enforcing the labor standards that are out there, particularly for those in low wage work. And what I mean by that is that, David Weil who was in the Obama administration labor department has done a ton on work on this in his, what he called the fissured workplace where people are in all these subcontracting roles and fast food franchises, that there's a lot of people who suffer wage thefts. You see their schedules get jerked around in a very dehumanizing way, in a way that makes it hard for them to plan and to take care of their kids. We just have to do a way better job of enforcing the laws on the books and unfortunately, we won't get that in the Trump administration that's calling for the labor department budget to shrink by more than 20 percent.
We need to do a much better job there. We need a true living wage across this country and I'd love to then see it indexed to inflation so we can stop fighting about this all the time…
We really need to rethink from top to bottom education. Training and education is not a magic bullet. It won't solve everything but again, we are in a knowledge age. We are leaving a huge numbers of people behind. Half the adults, slightly more than half in this country, don't have any kind of post-secondary education, not a four-year degree, not a two-year degree, not any kind of technical certificate.
It's really hard to make it in this economy, in this society now, without that and we do not do a good job at all of preparing people for lifelong learning. They're going to have to keep learning and keep going to school and keep getting new skills. We need to really rethink how we do that. Policy-wise, if I could do one thing, that would be the moonshot. 
Then, the last thing I would say because I think it's so important, policy is hugely important. Government has a huge role to play, but we have to put pressure on companies to shift their philosophy, their mindset, their culture and norms away from this maximizing shareholder value model.
There are some ways we can do this as investors, as customers, putting our dollars into companies that treat their people well and there's an increasing number of digital tools where we can peek behind the curtain and see how companies pay and treat their workers. We need to pressure companies into thinking about their workers as assets again.


Would-be flyers were temporarily stranded in Paris on Monday after a passenger spotted a scorpion aboard a Glasgow-bound flight. The plane, which was departing from Charles de Gaulle Airport, was delayed overnight in order to be fumigated.
“We were about to board, and as we were at the bottom of the gate a cleaner came out and said she saw a scorpion run up the inside of the plane, over the seats and back down again,” Glasgow resident Jimmy Smith, 62,  told the Daily Record. “They're being quiet about it now, but as we were passing a guy who was taking boarding passes I heard him say there was a scorpion.”
“We only found out about everything through the easyJet app. At first it was delayed until 4pm, then 7pm, 8pm,” passenger Graham Mckinnon  told the Guardian. “[I] overheard someone at the desk ask what was happening and they were told the plane was needing a clean. Then heard it was a broken chair, before the app released a picture stating it was in fact a scorpion that had been found.”
According to Mckinnon, the carrier’s app notification read: “We were hoping that we would be able to continue with your flight today but we were informed that a scorpion was sighted on board your plane.”
It wasn’t immediately clear how the arachnid got on the plane, though  rats and other pests are known to board flights by following the storage cases in which food trays are kept. Scorpions have also boarded flights in luggage and clothing.
“I've no idea how it got on, they were saying something about people taking stuff through in glass containers to take somewhere else — and that's how it got out,” he told the Daily Record.
The airline said that passengers were being offered hotel accommodations for the inconvenience. It also released a statement about the incident and confirmed that a passenger had indeed spotted the scorpion.
“We can confirm that a passenger reported to crew that a scorpion was on board. The safety and comfort of our passengers and crew is always our highest priority so, as a precaution, the aircraft will be fumigated before its next flight,” the airline said. “Although this is outside of our control, we would like apologise for any inconvenience to passengers.”
Monday’s incident isn’t the only report in recent months of uninvited scorpions boarding passenger planes. A similar incident occurred in May aboard a United Airlines flight, which was delayed for hours at the George Bush Intercontinental Airport in Houston after the  arachnid clawed out from a passenger’s clothing. During another incident in April — also aboard a United Airlines craft — a  scorpion fell from an overhead bin and landed in a man’s hair. He was stung after attempting to pick it up.
EasyJet did not immediately return International Business Times’ request for comment.

Stealing is against the law, unless, of course, the “offender” has permission from one of the world’s largest companies. Victims of Hurricane Harvey are short on water, so Coca-Cola allowed two men to break into their facility in Beaumont, Texas, to “steal” 14 cases of bottled water Saturday, USA Today reported Monday.
There were thousands of bottles of fresh water at Coca-Cola’s warehouse, but flooding prevented the company from distributing it. They informed Beaumont’s Fire Department, who then turned to Bill Zang, the president of the Hovercraft Unlimited Company. He waded through the flooded streets of Beaumont at 60 miles per hour on his hovercraft to recover the drinking water.

Zang happily took on the task, bringing along his friend, Sam Byers and a hand saw and hammer. They were able to break the lock and successfully find water. “This is so much fun!” said Byers.
Getting free water might have been one of the lighter moments, but rescuers spend their days checking empty houses to make sure they’re evacuated. While occasionally they’re able to save a pet, sometimes they come across a dead body.

After Hurricane Harvey wreaked devastation on Texas, Zang left his home in Rockport, Illinois with two of his hovercrafts to help the victims. At least 50 people were killed by the storm that left tens of thousands displaced.
“I have no idea when we got here,” Zang told USA Today. “What was that, two days ago? Four? The days all start running together after a while.” He added: “There is still a lot of work to do.”
One person who didn’t leap out to help victims was televangelist Joel Osteen. While Houston residents braved the storm, Osteen tweeted from the comfort of his home. The doors of his church, an arena that could seat nearly 17,000 people, remained closed days after Harvey flooded Houston. It wasn’t until Osteen faced mass criticism on social media that he decided to aid in the relief effort.
Osteen claimed in a Sunday sermon that he didn’t do anything wrong — that those who spoke against him were merely naysayers who wanted to see him and Lakewood Church flounder.

“I’m a peace with taking the heat for being precautious. But I don’t want to take the heat for being foolish. It’s easy for people to make judgments from a distance without having all the information,” he said.
“Some people that don’t know the facts and don’t want to know the facts will continue to try to stir things up,” Osteen said. “They would love to discredit the ministry and lessen our voice, but can I tell ya, they’re not that strong. The forces that are for us are great than the forces that are against us.”
After Osteen posted the video of his sermon to Facebook, he took to Twitter to finish his response. “Be of good cheer. Nothing is a surprise to Him. God has already armed you with strength for every battle,” he tweeted. “Don’t give up when it’s hard, when life’s not fair. Have faith in the middle. He will bring you through it.”

Less than a month after its unsuccessful attempt to purchase the Chicago Sun-Times, Tronc, a Chicago-based company, acquired the Pulitzer-Prize winning tabloid, The New York Daily News.
The announcement of the acquisition came Monday. Tronc purchased The Daily News for only $1 million and the assumption of operational and pension liabilities, Chicago Tribune reported.
Tronc is the publisher of The Los Angeles Times and The Chicago Tribune among other news outlets, and was formerly known as Tribune Publishing.
"We are excited to welcome the New York Daily News team to the tronc family, and we look forward to working with them to serve new audiences and marketers while delivering value for our shareholders," stated a press release from Tronc, quoting its CEO Justin Dearborn.
"As part of the tronc portfolio, the New York Daily News will provide us with another strategic platform for growing our digital business, expanding our reach and broadening our services for advertisers and marketers," Dearborn added.
The deal brought to an end the 25-year ownership of The Daily News by Mortimer B. Zuckerman, who had bought the paper out of bankruptcy in 1993 for $36 million in cash, reports said. 
Along with Zuckerman, Fred Drasner also owned The Daily News, however, he left the company in 2004. 
The Daily News was currently going through tough times, characterized by sweeping layoffs. In the 1940s, it used to have a circulation of more than two million a day, but in recent times it had been reduced to just a few hundred thousands. 
According to  the Daily News Zuckerman had started considering the option of selling the newspaper from 2015, when he informed The News' staff in an email: “A few weeks ago, we were approached about our potential interest in selling the Daily News. Although there were no immediate plans to consider a sale, we thought it would be prudent to explore the possibility and talk to potential buyers and/or investors."
Zuckerman put the publication on sale that year itself and received offers from several wealthy businessmen, including supermarket magnate John A. Catsimatidis.
However, the business tycoon later reconsidered his decision of selling the paper by taking it off the market, the New York Times reported.
Zuckerman is a Canadian-born American businessman whose interests predominantly lie in magazines, publishing, and real estate. He is now a naturalized citizen of the U.S.
He graduated from Harvard Business School, but remained in the university as an associate professor for the next nine years. After that, he also taught at Yale University. He also spent seven years at the real estate firm Cabot, Cabot & Forbes, where he did well and became senior vice president and chief financial officer, according to his biography.
In 1980, he bought the literary magazine The Atlantic Monthly and was the chairman from 1980 to 1999 before selling it to David G. Bradley for US$12 million. In 1984, he bought U.S. News & World Report.
In 2008, he was named the 147th wealthiest American; in 2007, he was the 188th richest man, his biography said citing Forbes.
 


A fight broke out aboard a recent Ryanair flight from England to Spain in an incident that saw both male and female passengers throwing punches during the brawl. The airline said following the Thursday incident that a passenger involved in the fight has been banned from flying with the carrier for life.
It wasn’t clear Monday what spurred the incident, though video seems to indicate the fight started with an argument between a man and a woman seated in a row behind him. Tensions apparently hit a boiling point shortly before the plane touched down in Alicante.

“It was just as we were about to land when the woman started kicking off,” 30-year-old Lucy Norris of Blyth, Northumberland,  told the Chronicle Live. “She was shouting, screaming and making a show of herself. She had been rude to a few people on the flight and I think she was mortal drunk.”
Norris added that police were reportedly made aware of the in-flight melee but did not board the flight to remove the woman from the cabin immediately upon landing. According to the witness, “They were waiting there as we got off.”
Ryanair — an Irish budget carrier and Europe’s largest short-haul airline —  issued a statement this week addressing the incident.
“The crew of this flight from Newcastle to Alicante requested police assistance upon arrival after a passenger became disruptive inflight. The aircraft landed normally and the passenger was met by police,” the airline said. “We will not tolerate unruly or disruptive behaviour at any time and the safety and comfort of our customers, crew and aircraft is our number one priority. This passenger has been banned from flying with Ryanair and this is now a matter for local police.”
The carrier added, “This is exactly why we are calling for significant changes to prohibit the sale of alcohol at airports, such as a two-drink limit per passenger and no alcohol sales before 10am.”
Ryanair has been a vocal proponent of the crackdown on alcohol sales at airports and before flights. Amid a hike in arrests pertaining to alcohol-related incidents, the airline called for a ban on early morning alcohol sales in addition to a cap on the number of drinks that passengers can order at airports, the  Guardian reported last month.
“It’s completely unfair that airports can profit from the unlimited sale of alcohol to passengers and leave the airlines to deal with the safety consequences,” Kenny Jacobs, Ryanair’s marketing director, said in a statement at the time.
He added: “This is an issue which the airports must now address and we are calling for significant changes to prohibit the sale of alcohol at airports, particularly with early morning flights and when flights are delayed.”
NOTE: An earlier version of this story referred to the banned passenger as a woman. It was not immediately clear whether the person banned from the airline was a man or a woman.

A New York woman is suing after a flight attendant on a JetBlue flight allegedly failed to properly secure the lid on a scalding cup of tea. Michelle Lavin, 25, reportedly suffered second- and third-degree burns on her backside and claimed the airline served a beverage not “fit for human consumption” in the Manhattan Supreme Court lawsuit.
The Manhattan woman filed the suit nearly three years after the 2014 incident, the  New York Post reported Saturday, as she initially opted to avoid litigation. But Lavin claimed the airline treated her poorly both during and following the incident aboard the flight from New York to Las Vegas. She was flying over the Labor Day weekend that year to visit her older sister.
Lavin said the incident occurred while an altercation between two other passengers escalated to an extent that it frightened others on the flight. A man had shouted at a woman to keep her dog from barking, and the woman reportedly became heated as well.
“She just screamed,” Lavin said. “It was insanely loud, like a horror movie. I got very nervous and everybody turned around and it was frightening.”
While turning to see what was happening, Lavin reportedly bumped the tray table with her tea, which she described as “very hot” upon being served. It spilled on her, and she immediately screamed in pain.
“I was in excruciating pain and had tears running down my eyes and asked them to get me anything. Cream. Something!” Lavin told the New York Post. “They said, ‘We don’t have anything for burns on the plane.’ They were looking at me like I was insane.”
Lavin, a help desk manager, described the pain as being “unreal” but said that every time she stood, she was asked to sit back down. She was reportedly offered aspirin and ice, but Lavin maintained that both the flight attendant who served her the tea and another crew member weren’t taking her seriously.
At that time, Lavin pulled her pants down to show them the burns. A  photo obtained by the New York Post shows Lavin’s backside blistered and burned to a deep red.
Both of the flight attendants were reportedly “horrified” by her burns and allegedly became much more accommodating after realizing the severity of the injury. Lavin said flight crew offered to have a stretcher waiting for her upon landing, but she opted instead to be taken to the emergency room by her sister. She said she was “humiliated” by the experience.
Thomas Lavin is representing his niece as her attorney in the suit. JetBlue declined the New York Post’s request for comment.
JetBlue is among the few airlines that have managed to avoid damning headlines currently slamming the airline industry for poor customer service, but the carrier is not without its own share of problems. In recent months, the airline has seen both passengers and crew being taken to the hospital or advised to seek medical care after  reports of strange odors, headaches and  burning sensations of the eyes during a slew of recent trips.

Hurricane Harvey has caused so much damage that the nearly $8 billion that the Trump Administration requested from the federal government is considered only a small down payment for recovery efforts. According to Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, reliefs efforts could eventually total up to $180 billion.
Appearing on CNN’s "State of the Union" Sunday, Abbott said the state would need a massive commitment from the federal government and claimed the range affected by Harvey could surpass both Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Sandy combined.
"Let’s not compare it to Sandy. Let’s compare it to Katrina," Abbott said.
Hurricane Harvey made landfall in Texas on Aug. 25. It was the most powerful hurricane to hit Texas in several decades and has a death toll that has reached 50. It has displaced more than 1 million people and damaged roughly 200,000 homes in southeast Texas.
"This is a long road to hoe if we are going to rebuild the fourth largest city in the United States as well as the entire geographic region," Abbott said on Fox News Sunday.
The nearly $8 billion from the federal government could be delayed unless the government acts fast and raises the government’s debt ceiling, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told Fox News Sunday. If the debt ceiling isn’t increased soon, the government will not have the adequate funds to continue operations past Sept. 29, Mnuchin told lawmakers. Arrogating adequate funds to supplement the Harvey relief efforts could quicken the deadline, Mnuchin said.
"The president and I believe the [debt ceiling] should be tied to the Harvey funding," Mnuchin told Fox News. "With Harvey, it's moved the situation up earlier. And without raising the debt limit, I'm not comfortable that we would get the money that we need this month to Texas to rebuild."
Sen. Roy Blunt of Missouri said on "Meet the Press" Sunday that Harvey’s aid fund will "likely" be merged with a bigger bill, which lawmakers will decide on soon.
"Whether you put that [Harvey aid] together with keeping the doors open for the government or the debt-ceiling vote, I think that’s something that will be decided in the next few days, I expect," Blunt said.
Recovery efforts continued Sunday with hopes to open businesses in Houston, according to Mayor Sylvester Turner. He suggested that whoever can conduct business should open their doors.
"I’m encouraging people to get up and let’s get going,” Turner said on "Meet the Press."
"There is still tremendous need. Don’t want to downplay that but most of the city is dry, and I’m saying to people — if you can open, let’s open up and let’s get started," Turner said.

As President Trump attempts to shut down a federal board that helps oversee chemical plant safety, a former top official from the panel says the unfolding crisis at a Houston plant could have been prevented had the plant owner's lobbying group not fought the board's work.
In 1998, when the Chemical Safety Board (CSB) was formed, Chief Operating Officer Phyllis Scalettar led the team in creating a comprehensive database of chemical incidents, relying on data from five different federal agencies. The CSB created the database — which was the first of its kind — because officials believed a central resource documenting all incident reports, especially relevant information on what caused the incidents, was vital for the board to fulfill its mandated duty: to investigate toxic chemical incidents and determine the causes of those incidents.
When the CSB published its one-of-a-kind report in February 1999, analyzing data from 600,000 chemical incidents over a decade, and presented it to Congress, the feedback was positive. But when the American Chemistry Council (ACC) got hold of the report, the group hurled accusations of bias at the nonpartisan CSB in an effort to discredit the report. An influential lobbying and campaign spending operation, the ACC successfully pressured Congress to withhold sufficient funding for the CSB, preventing it from updating and enhancing the crucial database.
Arkema — a specialty chemicals company whose plant in Crosby, Texas, exploded last week and which pressed regulators to kill a chemical plant safety rule — is a member of the ACC.
The Chemical Safety Board planned a follow-up report for the 2000 fiscal year, but it never happened.
“Perhaps, had the report led to the envisioned subsequent work, risks that now pose current threats to the Houston area — and, indeed, throughout the U.S. — could have been evaluated and addressed prior to the disaster in a comprehensive, data-driven manner,” wrote Scalettar in an email to International Business Times.
Going forward, an underfunded CSB would not be able to harness an updated database to help prepare for, and prevent, the tens of thousands of chemical incidents that occur every year in the U.S.
Scalettar confirmed there is no current central resource in the U.S. for information on preventing chemical incidents.
The CSB still exists, but it continues to be hampered by what officials say are insufficient resources.
In April 2013, investigations into 13 prior chemical incidents were incomplete. CSB leadership told the Center for Public Integrity at the time that the budget allocated by Congress wasn’t nearly enough to tackle the numerous incidents. "We've made innumerable proposals over the years...pointing out the significant discrepancy between the number of serious accidents and the ones that we can handle from a practical standpoint," said CSB managing director Daniel Horowitz.
The chemical industry, led by the ACC, has for years fought legislation requiring chemical facilities to use safer technology.
"I was quite surprised that anyone would resist this concept, this concept of prevention," Rafael Moure-Eraso, then the CSB chairman, told NPR in 2013.
“You have to make a cost-benefit about what is more costly: to engage in a process to try to mitigate or avoid hazards; or deal with the families of the people who get killed, the destruction of an industry, the destruction of a community," said Moure-Eraso. "And I claim that it's a lot more expensive to deal with these catastrophic losses than what it will take to invest to prevent this to happen in the first place."

Tens Of Thousands Of Chemical Incidents Each Year
In 1990, Congress amended the Clean Air Act to enhance its efforts to reduce acid rain, urban air pollution and toxic air emissions. The amendments established the Chemical Safety Board “to investigate accidental releases of chemicals.” In particular, the board was created “to determine the cause or causes of an accident whether or not those causes were in violation of any current and enforceable requirement.”
It took more than seven years — until January 1998 — for the government to staff, fund and launch the board. When board finally began its work, its first order of business was to study the hundreds of thousands of prior chemical incidents across the country and analyze the reasons that these incidents had occurred.
“Most importantly from a safety standpoint, existing databases do not contain information on the root causes of incidents or patterns of causes that are the most solid clues to prevention,” the report states.
A 1993 EPA report admitted that the government’s chemical safety system was full of “overlaps, inefficiencies, and some gaps in the statutory and regulatory framework as well as in the government's management structure.” It also states that “sufficiency and quality of government data on chemical incidents impact ... most importantly, lives and livelihoods.”
CSB staff members began their research with over 10 million chemical incidents that occurred on land between 1987 and 1996. After filtering out duplicate incident reports and those that contained insufficient information, the board was left with 605,000 incidents to incorporate into its study, which came out in 1999.
Some key findings include:
—During the period 1987 to 1996, chemical incidents were recorded in 95 percent (3,145) of the nearly 3,300 U.S. counties.
—42 percent of the incidents occurred at fixed locations occupied by industrial and commercial businesses, and 43 percent related to transportation.
—9,705 incidents resulted in at least one death or injury. There were 2,565 deaths (with an average of 127 incidents per year resulting in at least one death) and 22,949 injuries.
—California had the most incidents (100,000 during the period from 1987 to 1996), nearly double the number of incidents recorded for Texas (55,209), the second leading state. The remainder of the top 10 states, in descending order, were Ohio, New York, Louisiana, Illinois, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Florida and New Jersey.
—Mechanical failures led to 40 percent of the incidents. Intentional and unintentional human acts were cited in another 27 percent of the reports. The effects of natural phenomena accounted for only 1 percent of the incidents. Approximately 29 percent of the incident reports did not indicate an initiating event.
A more recent study of the period from 1980 to 2008 indicates that 3 percent of hazmat emissions occurred due to natural phenomena, and these nature-induced emissions increased as the years passed.
The ACC waged a campaign against this report.
“The industry association challenged the accuracy of the reporting data used in the study, failing to recognize and acknowledge that the data were reported by the industry itself,” Scalettar told IBT. “It also pointed out the data limitations referenced in the report undermined the findings, again overlooking the fact that identification of limitations in any research study are fundamental to establishing that claims made are not misleading, and recommendations for future work are supported by the issues raised.”
Scalettar added that “because our [CSB] board was populated by some people who had strong attachments to industry, I would be remiss not to say that there was probably some back-room arm twisting.”
Freedom of Information Act Request records show that the ACC submitted comments regarding the EPA’s risk assessment practices, discouraging the consideration of worst-case scenarios and “biased risk assessments.”
Meanwhile, in 2001, the ACC and similar industry groups successfully convinced the George W. Bush administration to kill chemical safety provisions proposed by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, including a strengthened Process Safety Management standard.
An Arkema Disaster
Included in the CSB report was a map showing all chemical incidents analyzed. Many chemical incidents that occurred between 1987 and 1996 were located in southern California, but another area with one of the highest concentrations of explosions, emissions and other hazardous events was the southeastern coast of Texas, which is where Hurricane Harvey hit.

Nearly 20 years after that report, Arkema North America’s CEO said that “no one anticipated six feet of water” that Harvey brought to his plant in Crosby. But Sam Mannan of Texas A&M University's Mary Kay O'Connor Process Safety Center told the Houston Chronicle that it would be surprising if Arkema had not considered a flood of this magnitude before. And there was a way to prevent the explosions: Companies can “quench” organic peroxides by combining them with another chemical, potentially eliminating the danger.
"You'll lose the feedstock, but it's safer than letting it go into runaway mode," Mannan told the Chronicle.
As IBT reported on Saturday, Arkema warned its investors of the risks of chemical storage explosions at its sites.
Arkema’s most recent risk management plan submitted to the EPA is from June 2014; the facility has high levels of toxic chemicals, making it a Program 3 site that is required to file such plans with the EPA. The Environmental Defense Fund reviewed Arkema’s plan, which the public may only inspect in person in an EPA reading room. That plan, which revealed that the facility held 85,000 pounds of the flammable substance 2 methylpropene and 66,000 pounds of toxic sulfur dioxide, cited a 2013 hazard analysis that identified concerns including “equipment failure; loss of cooling, heating, electricity; floods (flood plain); hurricane; other major failure identified: power failure or power surge.”
On Friday, after several explosions had already occurred, Arkema announced that least 225 metric tons of peroxides stored at its Crosby plant were likely to explode in the near future.
The company has a history of dangerous chemical safety practices, including “serious” hazardous chemical-related safety violations in February by the Arkema plant in Crosby, resulting in a $90,000 fine from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.
Trump’s Attack On Chemical Safety
As IBT reported Thursday, Arkema and the ACC successfully lobbied the EPA to halt new chemical safety rules that were meant to go into effect in March 2017. Numerous U.S. Congressmen from Texas co-sponsored a House resolution to quash those rules. Previously, then-Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt and Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton sent a letter to the EPA expressing their opposition to the safety measures.
This year, as EPA director, Pruitt has been able to delay the implementation of the safety rules twice, and as Crosby residents were evacuating due to Arkema’s plant explosions, a court denied environmental groups’ request to impose the rules as a lawsuit over the delay moves through the courts. But there are even higher-ranking officials who are trying to minimize chemical safety: Trump’s budget proposal would eliminate the CSB altogether, something that has elicited serious criticism.
“If you want to put the American people in danger this is the way to do it,” former EPA director Christine Todd Whitman told Reuters. “The chemical industry has fought back from the beginning.”
“If you can’t prove your relevance in today’s administration, you become superfluous,” said Scalettar. “Can [the CSB] show they’ve made any significant progress in reducing chemical incidents? Probably with great difficulty.”
With the current Congress and White House, Scalettar doesn’t paint a rosy picture of the near future. “There will continue to be chemical incidents, but we could make the circumstances a little bit better. But after 20 or 30 years at this, I’d say the odds aren’t very good to make it better.”


Arkema, the specialty chemicals company whose chemical storage facility in Crosby, Texas, exploded Thursday morning and is currently spewing noxious smoke near Houston, warned its investors earlier this year about the dangers of possible explosions and public health risks from the chemicals it stores. At the same time, the French-based company lobbied the U.S. Congress and the Environmental Protection Agency to delay implementing new chemical facilities safety rules, as International Business Times previously reported. Two more chemical storage trailers exploded Friday evening and more explosions from the remaining trailers are expected in the coming days.
“The Group’s facilities may be subject to risks of accidents, fires, explosions and pollution due to the very nature of their operations and to the level of hazard, toxicity or flammability of certain raw materials,” Arkema wrote to investors in March, in the company’s annual report for 2016.
Arkema’s backup generators failed on Thursday, which meant that volatile chemicals were unable to be stored cooly enough, causing them to burn and explode. Speaking to the Houston Chronicle, an Arkema safety official declined to say whether its backup generators were elevated, a common-sense precaution in case of flooding. However, the company was well aware of the potential dangers of floods at its plants, as it warned its investors that “exceptional flooding” could lead to the shutdown of its facilities.
Furthermore, Arkema’s 2014 Risk Management Plan for the Crosby facility specifically noted the risk of equipment failure due to flooding. Facilities regulated as a “Program 3” facility by the EPA, such as the one in Crosby, are required to create and submit Risk Management Plans. The 2014 plan is the latest filed with the EPA. However, those documents are not publicly accessible online and can only be viewed by visiting federal reading rooms in person. The watchdog group Environmental Defense Fund did so on Thursday, finding that a hazard process analysis filed by Arkema specifically for the Crosby facility “identified concerns, including: equipment failure; loss of cooling, heating, electricity; floods (flood plain); hurricane; other major failure identified: power failure or power surge.”
A flood causing a power failure that lead to a loss of cooling is the exact scenario that has caused the recent explosions and current fires in Crosby.
After initially promising to provide its inventory of chemicals, Arkema has since backtracked that promise only offering a list of chemicals on site but not their quantities or how they are stored, making it difficult to assess public health risks from the smoke overhead in Crosby. In the 2016 annual report to investors, the company noted as a risk to investors that it uses “toxic or hazardous substances to manufacture its products,” but does not specify at which locations certain chemicals are stored or how toxic they may be. On Thursday, the company’s president, Richard Rennard, declined to tell reporters whether chemicals burning at the Crosby facility were potentially toxic.
At the same time that Arkema warned investors of these health and safety risks, the company and its trade association, the American Chemistry Council, was lobbying the Trump administration to delay implementing new EPA safety rules for chemical facilities. IBT’s review of federal lobbying records found that Trump’s EPA administrator Scott Pruitt blocked the new rules following that extensive lobbying campaign.
The rules that Pruitt blocked would have gone into effect on March 14. Arkema’s annual report for 2016, which noted the risk of explosions at its facility, was filed on March 30.
In that annual report, Arkema warned investors that increased regulations could jeopardize its business, requiring it to, for instance, “institute costly emissions control or reduction systems.”
“The Group’s business activities are subject to frequently changing international and national laws and regulations in the areas of environmental protection and health and safety,” the 2016 annual report noted. “These laws and regulations impose increasingly strict obligations.”
In Arkema’s 2015 annual report, the company similarly warned investors about the risk of “increased safety costs” endangering profit margins.
“The Group’s business and financial results are likely to be directly or indirectly impacted by any adverse changes to the economic and political environment in the countries in which the Group operates,” read the 2015 annual report.
That year’s annual report did, however, reassure investors that the company carries an environmental insurance policy that will cover up to $50 million of liability within the U.S.


A Denver-bound Southwest Airlines flight was temporarily delayed this week after a passenger allegedly assaulted a crew member. The airline told International Business Times that the incident, which occurred Wednesday at the Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport, was diffused after local authorities “assumed control of the situation.”
“Shortly after pushing off a gate at Sky Harbor destined for Denver, the Pilots in command of flight 948 elected to return to the gate after a passenger failed to comply with instructions from the Crew,” the airline told IBT.  
“Law enforcement officers assumed control of the situation (and investigation) as the aircraft returned to a gate,” the airline added. “The flight, with 163 Customers onboard, operated uneventfully from there and arrived in Denver 57 minutes behind schedule under the operation of the original Crew of six.”
ABC-affiliate KNXV reported Thursday that police were called to the scene after David Dutson, 58, allegedly became physical with an employee of the carrier. The specifics around the incident were not immediately clear Friday, but the airline told KNXV that Dutson didn’t follow directions from airline staff after leaving the gate.
Dutson was later handcuffed and removed from the flight, and an investigation is reportedly underway. Video of the incident obtained by KNXV shows Dutson being escorted into a police cruiser on the tarmac.

Dutson is only the most recent in a string of incidents of passengers who have been escorted off of flights as the result of disruptive or rowdy behavior. During one incident, a pilot for an Ibiza-bound flight was forced to  physically leave the cockpit to reprimand several passengers for apparent intoxication prior to takeoff. In another more high-profile case, actor  Jason Mitchell was recorded going on a profanity-laced tirade that ultimately resulted in him being removed from the Delta Air Lines flight.
Following an incident in November, a judge on Monday  ordered a man to pay Hawaiian Airlines  $97,817 for disruptive behavior after he became verbally and physically abusive midway through a New York-bound flight. According to an affidavit of the incident, the man slapped a flight attendant on the shoulder with the back of his hand, threatened to cut his girlfriend’s throat and name-called her three children “piggies.”

As nearby residents fled the area surrounding an  exploding Arkema S.A. chemical plant in the flood-ravaged Houston suburbs, a federal court effectively approved the Environmental Protection Agency's delay of rules designed to strengthen chemical facility safety measures. The ruling was a win for Arkema and its lobbying group, which had successfully pressed officials in President Donald Trump's administration to block the regulation, and for the broader chemical industry, which has bankrolled the campaigns of top Republican lawmakers.
Arkema is already benefiting from the rule's delay: In a teleconference on the crisis Friday, the company refused to release a map of its facilities or an inventory of the potentially hazardous chemicals at the beleaguered plant, as would be required by the heightened safety standards. The company argued that disclosing such information to the public could put the company at risk of terrorism threats, the Houston Chronicle reported. Under  both federal and state law, the firms can elect to disclose such information, or not to.
Less than four months ago, Arkema pressed the EPA to repeal the chemical plant safety rule, criticizing the rule's provisions that require chemical companies to disclose more information to the public. In a May 15, 2017 letter to the EPA, Arkema's legislative affairs director wrote that “new mandates that require the release to the public of facility-specific chemical information may create new security concerns if there are not sufficient safeguards to ensure that those requesting the information have a legitimate need for the information for the purposes of community emergency preparedness.”

Trump’s Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt used the same national security rationale in his March  decision to review, and therefore delay, amendments to the agency’s Risk Management Program, an amendment to a part of the Clean Air Act that would boost transparency and safety at plants at risk of spewing harmful chemicals into the air of nearby communities. (The EPA once again  delayed it in June, pushing implementation to Feb. 2019.)
Even as the disaster unfolded in Texas, the D.C. District Court of Appeals rejected the environmental groups’ argument that by pushing off the rule’s implementation, the EPA “ignores the serious consequences of delaying essential emergency preparedness provisions” and denies “vulnerable fenceline communities” access to crucial information on hazardous chemicals, according to court documents obtained by IBT.
Gordon Sommers, an associate attorney representing the environmental groups that  sued the EPA in June over the rule’s delay, said the court’s approval of the delay was “unfortunate.” He also disputed the notion that greater transparency made Arkema and other chemical companies more vulnerable to terrorist attacks, citing the importance for first responders to know exactly which chemicals they’re going to be dealing with in cases like that of the Crosby plant.

“It’s disgraceful that the administration has delayed these rules,” said Sommers, whose non-profit organization, Earthjustice, is representing the Sierra Club, the Union of Concerned Scientists and Air Alliance Houston, among others, in their legal battle against the agency. The explosion at Arkema’s Crosby plant, he said, “shows more than ever that there’s a need for the rule, for better preparation.”
Sommers said the court ruling was not all bad news for environmental groups, as the judges opted to expedite the groups’ overall lawsuit to keep the EPA from further delaying the rule.
In a statement to IBT, Michael Abboud, a spokesperson for the EPA — which  announced Thursday that it was monitoring the situation at the plant, was assisting emergency personnel and found “no concentrations of concern for toxic materials” at the scene — said the rule would not have fully taken effect until 2021, and therefore its delay had no impact on the situation in Crosby. He denied that an explosion had taken place, describing the situation as a fire, despite reports contradicting that characterization. And while the Arkema plant in Crosby faced a  $90,000 fine from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration for “serious” hazardous chemical-related safety violations in February, Abboud said the facility faced “no recent EPA [Risk Management Program] enforcement actions.”
Sommers called the EPA’s claim that the rule’s delay did not affect the likelihood or emergency response to the hazardous explosions at the Crosby plant “a lie,” as agencies commonly give industries time to adjust the technologies they use to comply with an new rule, along with intermediate deadlines for piecemeal compliance. If the Risk Management Program amendments hadn’t been pushed back, he said, things might’ve gone differently at Arkema.
When asked by IBT to comment on the crisis in Crosby and its involvement in the delay of the EPA Risk Management Program rule, a spokesperson for Arkema sent documents showing the firm's previous comments on the regulation, addressed to EPA officials, calling for it to be changed or repealed. As far as the situation at its Crosby plant, the Arkema maintained via  press release Thursday that it had “followed its hurricane preparation plan” ahead of Tropical Storm Harvey’s landfall and “had redundant contingency plans in place.”
In the wake of a  deadly 2013 fertilizer plant explosion, former President Barack Obama issued an  executive order amending the EPA’s Risk Management Program to require chemical companies to boost emergency preparedness, provide better information access for nearby citizens who’d be impacted by a chemical plant disaster and improve prevention measures.
Pruitt, who  fought the rule as Oklahoma attorney general and was part of a group of Republican governors that  partnered with the industry in an effort to demolish the Clean Air Act last year,  selected Nancy Beck, the former policy director of the lobbying group American Chemistry Council, to head the branch of the EPA that oversees enforcement of regulations of harmful chemicals.
Arkema — along with the American Chemistry Council, of which the French chemical giant  is a member — has waged an aggressive campaign to change the regulations in the industry’s favor, as IBT reported.  
In May 2016, Arkema sent a  letter to the EPA describing the rule as overly burdensome. In January, the American Chemistry Council and other industry groups wrote Congressional leaders a  letter urging them to kill the rule by way of the Congressional Review Act, which lets lawmakers repeal recently-passed regulations by a simple majority vote. In first quarter of this year, the Council directly  lobbied the EPA on the issue.
About a week after the chemical industry organizations sent the letter, Rep. Markwayne Mullin (R-Okl.) introduced a  House resolution disapproving of the rule. Its cosponsors included Texas lawmakers who represent districts in and around Houston, including Brian Babin, whose district houses Arkema’s flame-spewing Crosby plant.
Sommers rejected the idea that the newly-amended rule is too burdensome for industry compliance, and emphasized the importance of monitoring the  more than 12,500 plants in the U.S. with chemical storage above regulatory thresholds.
“I think anybody who reads the rules would frankly have a hard time believing that, because it’s a very, very common-sense, market based regulation,” he said, adding that the Obama administration was essentially “going after the lowest of the low hanging fruit” and that “the rule that the epa adopted is hardly some draconian regulatory scheme.”


Labor Day is a notoriously busy time to travel, and 2017 is expected to see record highs in the days ahead of and after the official holiday — particularly for travelers who plan to fly. Airlines for America announced this month that it expected 16.1 passengers worldwide would fly on United States carriers during the timeframe.
The spike in holiday travelers went up by 5 percent from last year’s estimation for the same seven-day period. Airlines for America said in a  press release earlier this month that “airlines are adding 133,000 seats per day across their networks to accommodate the expected increase in demand.”
Friday, Sept. 1 is expected be the busiest time to travel, but attempting to get around Monday, Sept. 4 will also prove difficult. The reason for the spike in travelers over the holiday? Household income jumps and low fare prices.
“As household wealth increases, ticket prices remain low and airlines large and small continue to grow, consumers are finding it easier and more affordable than ever to get away for personal or family travel,” John Heimlich, Airlines for America Vice President and Chief Economist, said in a statement.
But Airlines for America says that shouldn’t worry flyers too much.
“While we expect a growth in passenger traffic over the Labor Day holiday, flyers can rest assured that U.S. airlines have appropriately increased the number of seats available for their late summer getaways,” Heimlich said.
For folks who are forgoing travel over the long weekend, now could be the time to book a vacation for the future. The end of August kicked off what will be a period of discounted airfare that continues through November. Travel experts agree that now is the time to get the best value on the dollar for both domestic and international airfare.
As International Business Times  previously reported, travelers can potentially save hundreds of dollars flying to premier vacation destinations like Rome or Madrid. Those looking to book flights domestically can see savings of between $20-50, depending on the destination and the flexibility of booking dates.
“[I]t’s the start of the off peak season,” Sanjay Hathiramani, Global SVP of Supplier Relations for CheapOair, said in a statement last month. “Fares are going to continue to stay low until Thanksgiving. Especially for those looking for deals to international destinations, the time to book your tickets [is] during this window, beginning at the end of August.”

Air India reportedly suspended an airline commander Thursday for a variety of alleged violations. The senior A-320 commander has come under fire for his misconduct, which includes recklessly driving the company's aircraft, according to Times of India. 
The senior commander's actions have been overlooked until now. He reportedly announced to airline passengers that Air India has made several violations and that he wouldn't take flight until the airline confessed to its mistakes. The commander's actions were reported to Air India by a senior Boeing 747 pilot that rode as a passenger on the flight, according to the Times of India. 
The grounded employee also operated an Air India flight without passengers that appeared on the company's flight safety department radar for reckless flying. During the flight from Delhi to Gaya, the commander allegedly flew at a speed that exceeded the maximum requirement for takeoff. He also allegedly sharply flew the flight nose up by 24 degrees, which exceeded the normal expectation of 12-13 degrees. The aircraft's tires were reportedly hot.
"The commander has been grounded," an AI spokesman said, according to Times of India. "He will be given a refresher as a co-pilot and then when back flying, will do so as a first officer."
A representative for Air India did not immediately return International Business Times' request for comment. 
The qualifications to become a senior A-320 officer are steep. Those interested in the position would first need to acquire a Private Pilot License (PPL). Obtaining a PPL allows recipients to become the Pilot-in-Command (PIC) for a private aircraft, according to Alpha Aviation Group (AAG). This training period for this certification includes three weeks of ground school, 40 hours of basic training and five hours of training in a simulator.
Successful students then move on to complete training for a Commercial Pilot License (CPL). Earning the CPL is essential to becoming an authorized commercial airline pilot. Trainees are required to finish 11 weeks of ground schooling on the theory of flight and 140 flight hours, among other training practices.
Instrument Rating (IR) and Type Rating (TR) are the final certifications that follow, according to AAG. An IR certification enables pilots to fly in adverse or severe weather conditions (i.e. thunderstorms), whereas the TR certificate allows for pilots to fly a particular aircraft (i.e. Airbus A320, like the grounded Air India commander).
Airlines have different requirements for senior A-320 officer candidates. Wizz Air, a Hungary-based airline, requires successful applicants to have completed a total flight time of 1,500 hours in an A320. Not only do potential employees need to have adequate certification and licensing, but they also need to be prepared to fly from any Wizz Air base. 
Airline controversies have become a regular occurrence. However, it's rare when the controversy revolves around a flight commander. Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) saw the most recent incident of an airline pilot coming under fire. The pilot was caught napping on a flight to London in May. He placed the aircraft in the hands of a trainee.

CryptoTax, a brand of Munich based 21 Consulting GmbH, is offering and constantly developing tax reporting solutions and other regulatory declaration services for customers of cryptocurrency exchanges and users of blockchain assets to help them be compliant with the law of their residence state.
The vision of the German company is to simplify legal obligations for investors in digital assets by serving easy but high-quality services to businesses and private individuals. CryptoTax says it has a strategic alliance with KPMG to get access to their worldwide network of tax and legal experts and to ensure a constant coverage of the current state of legislation.
Considering the price spikes of blockchain assets within the last month, a bulk of cryptocurrency users are expected to have high taxable income in tax year 2017. Also the awareness of regulators and tax authorities is constantly increasing. But since there are various unanswered questions regarding the legal qualification and taxation of digital assets a lot of users struggle to calculate their taxable gains and losses and need help to fulfill their regulatory and tax declaration obligations.
Now you can get a country-specific tax report to enable you to pay taxes on your cryptocurrency gains. Good news, right?  Photo: Pixabay
Zurich-based Lykke offers users to trade cryptographic tokens, fiat and virtual currencies by simply using their mobile device running an iOS or Android operating system. Using so-called "colored coins" (which are described as blockchain based collateralised debt obligations) the exchange allows the transfer of any kind of real-world asset to the Bitcoin blockchain and enable trading of such without incurring transaction fees.
Richard Olsen, Lykke founder and CEO, said : "This is one more step along the way toward making blockchain-based trading a viable alternative to traditional markets. It is essential for us to be able to offer a wide range of reporting and declaration services. Transparency is one of our foundational values: trust among our user base, and openness to regulatory authorities. CryptoTax's strategic thinking demonstrates their shared commitment to these goals."
Klaus Himmer, CEO of 21 Consulting, said: "Because of our experience in the conventional financial services industry we know that tax reports are already market standard and will also help companies operating in the field of cryptocurrencies to reach a broader market acceptance while differentiating from other providers.
"We are very pleased Lykke chose us to support them to manage the increasing demand of country-specific tax reports. We are sure that the cooperation will help both parties to foster their strong market position and help them to drive the market acceptance of blockchain based financial instruments", he added.


The Illinois Blockchain Initiative, a collaborative effort exploring blockchain's impact on government, has partnered with self-sovereign identity firm Evernym, to create a secure, self-sovereign identity for Illinois citizens during the birth registration process.
The concept will augment work from the W3C's Verifiable Claims Task Force and use the Sovrin Foundation's distributed identity ledger, said a statement.
Self-sovereign identity refers to a digital identity that remains entirely under the individual's control. A self-sovereign identity can be efficiently and securely validated by entities who require it, free from reliance on a centralised repository.

Recently, the Illinois Blockchain Initiative partnered with Hashed Health, a US-based blockchain startup focused on medical applications, to see whether the tech can help streamline how medical licenses are issued and tracked.
Jennifer O'Rourke, Blockchain Business Liaison for the Illinois Blockchain Initiative, said: "To structurally address the many issues surrounding digital identity, we felt it was important to develop a framework that examines identity from its inception at child birth. Government has an important role to play in the development of any digital identity ecosystem. Identity is not only foundational to nearly every government service, but is the basis for trust and legitimacy in the public sector."
In the proposed framework, government agencies will verify birth registration information and then cryptographically sign identity attributes such as legal name, date of birth, sex or blood type, creating what are called "verifiable claims" or attributes. Permission to view or share each of these government-verified claims is stored on the tamper-proof distributed ledger protocol in the form of a decentralised identifier, said the statement. The identifier guarantees each attribute is cryptographically sealed and only accessible with explicit consent of the identity holder or in the case of a newborn child, his or her legal guardian.

Businesses and governments will be able to verify and authenticate citizens by requesting encrypted access to these verifiable claims. This minimises the need for entities to establish, maintain and rely upon their own proprietary databases of identity information.
"This architecture allows us to bridge the best of both worlds, combining government's robust infrastructure for identity verification with a platform engineered for the digital identity ecosystem. This digital identity system is extensible, inter-operable and at the same time ensures the utmost security, privacy and user-agency," said Cab Morris of the Illinois Blockchain Initiative. "Additionally, this model for digital identity can extend beyond the boundaries of government and has broad applicability for many products and services in the private sector."
A formal announcement of the project will be made on 1 September by Evernym's Chief Trust Officer Drummond Reed at the MyData2017 Conference in Helsinki, Finland.
Reed said: "The successful transition to an identity ecosystem that is truly self-sovereign requires conversion of 'breeder documents', such as birth certificates, which serve as the basis for obtaining other documents. Digitising these foundational documents in a state the size and importance of Illinois will make a major contribution to the larger effort of solving the online identity problem."


A gay father who was falsely accused by United Airlines staff of molesting his 5-year-old son earlier this year is speaking out about the incident. Henry Amador-Batten, who  fell asleep with his arm over his son during the May flight, now questions whether the allegation was racially motivated.
Speaking with People for an interview published Thursday,  Amador-Batten said that he’s never been subjected to discrimination on the basis of his sexual orientation. He said he has, however, experienced racial profiling. Amador-Batten, a Latino man, recalled several incidents in which he was discriminated against while traveling.
“I was nearly always targeted by security both in the U.S. and in the countries I was entering,” he told People. “I’m assuming that a well-dressed Hispanic man flying out of Miami was easily suspected of being in the drug business. I missed flights, had luggage basically torn apart. I had tubes of toothpaste squeezed out and even hems on my jacket and pants ripped open.”
He added, “We can’t know what the flight attendant’s motives, perceptions, or intentions were. Although both Ben and I are Hispanic, he is lighter than I. Did the attendant see an older Hispanic man traveling with a little white boy? I can’t imagine he could have but who knows?”
The captain of the flight from Newark, New Jersey, to the family’s home in North Carolina told authorities at the time that crew witnessed Amador-Batten touching his son “near the genitals,” and Amador-Batten later was detained and questioned. 
Amador-Batten’s experience was widely publicized after the family  posted about it on Facebook and clarified that he had his “hand/arm laying across [the sleeping boy’s] lap.” 
“After being made to feel like a criminal in front of other passengers as they exited the plane my husband filed a report of his own mentioning that the male flight attendant that must have accused him had treated him oddly in flight, and was promptly sent on his way,” Amador-Batten’s husband, Joel, wrote at the time. “This is the icing on the cake for a man who has spent nearly the last two weeks in Puerto Rico dealing with his father's quick decline and subsequent death. This is not how anyone deserves to be treated.”
United Airlines issued a statement to International Business Times in May addressing the incident.
“In this instance, the crew believed it was appropriate to ask authorities to meet the plane and interview the customer,” said the airline. “After speaking with the customer, authorities determined that no further action was necessary. Our customers should always be treated with the utmost respect and we have followed up with our customer to apologize for the misunderstanding.”

A passenger who forced a November flight from New York to Honolulu to turn around was ordered to pay the airline $97,817 this week. New Jersey resident James August’s disruptive behavior included threatening to cut his girlfriend’s throat, name-calling her children and slapping a flight attendant’s shoulder with the back of his hand.
On Monday, a federal judge ruled that August must pay costs the airline accrued for the return trip back to Hawaii, the  Honolulu Star-Advertiser reported. The costs incurred included fuel, maintenance, various landing and re-stocking fees and overhead for the airline’s ground and replacement flight crew.
In addition to the extraordinary costs of delaying the Nov. 29 flight, Hawaiian Airlines also reportedly racked up $46,900 in meal vouchers given as compensation to delayed passengers aboard the flight.  NJ.com reported Wednesday that August was not ordered to pay the airline restitution for those costs.
An  affidavit of the incident from the FBI, which handles crimes committed in the United States airspace, said August made contact with a flight attendant using the back of his hand, threatened to slice his girlfriend’s throat and verbally accosted her three children by referring to them as “piggies.”
In addition to the aforementioned behavior, August also repeatedly referred to his girlfriend — who was identified only by the initials K.P. by the FBI — as a “c---” and threatened the safety of the woman, her children and flight crew. During boarding, the woman’s 11-year-old son was reportedly observed crying and asked, “Can you please just keep him away from us?”
At one point while August was restrained by the crew, he repeatedly said he was going to return to his seat and punch his girlfriend in the face. He also threatened a flight attendant by stating: “I will take you out.”
Court documents indicated that August had been drinking prior to boarding. He also consumed two small bottles of liquor and took an unidentified pill, according to the affidavit.
“Turning an aircraft around due to a passenger’s unruly interference with our flight crew not only creates an inconvenience to all guests on board, but is extremely costly,” a representative for Hawaiian Airlines told International Business Times in a statement. “We appreciate the efforts of the U.S. Attorney’s Office and the ruling allowing Hawaiian to recoup some of the hard costs it incurred.”
August pleaded guilty to interfering with flight crew in February, the  Honolulu Star-Advertiser reported at the time. When asked by the judge what occurred, August said he did not “remember much” about the incident.

Using the bitcoin cryptocurrency to buy goods and services online can lead to the currency's famed anonymity being overturned and user identity exposed, a team of researchers has warned.
It was found that cookies used by websites to track visitors around the internet make it possible for the anonymity treasured by bitcoin users to be stripped away, linking bitcoin wallets with the real-world identity of their owners.

The researchers also found the use of privacy-protecting services like CoinJar, designed to add a further layer of anonymity to bitcoin transactions, does not stop customers from being identified by third-party web trackers used by online merchants.
The report, compiled by privacy researcher Dillon Reisman and Princeton University's Steven Goldfeder, Harry Kalodner and Arvind Narayanan, claims of 130 merchants that accept bitcoin, they found 53 leaked payment information to 40 different third parties, who could then link bitcoins with their owners. Most of these leaks came from the shopping basket pages of retail sites, and were done on purpose for advertising and analytical purposes.

Worse than these deliberate leaks, the researchers say, were the "many merchant websites [with] far more serious (and likely unintentional) information leaks that directly reveal the exact transaction on the blockchain to dozens of trackers." Linking a blockchain transaction with the once-anonymous owner of the bitcoins is then trivial.
Even if customers used software to protect them from being tracked, the researchers claim many sites still helped themselves to personal information, which could in turn lead to bitcoins being linked to their owners.
The researchers explained: "We show that, if the user pays using cryptocurrency, trackers typically possess enough information about the purchase to uniquely identify the transaction on the blockchain, link it to the user's cookie, and further to the user's real identity."
Worse still, they found that if a tracker is able to spot two purchases made by the same user and link them to the blockchain, a public record of all (anonymised) bitcoin transactions, the tracker data can be used to identify a person's entire bitcoin transaction history.
Lastly, the researchers warn how this identification technique is passive and "can be retroactively applied to past purchases."
There isn't a great deal consumers can do to fully protect themselves from such attacks, the report says, as "most of the privacy-breaching data flows we identify are intentional and not accidental."


Disruptive passengers riding with EasyJet, a European airline, caused the flight to divert from its original path this week. The flight — which was in route to Paphos, Cyprus, from Edinburgh, Scotland — was diverted because the two male passengers were allegedly drunk.
EasyJet confirmed the news on its website Wednesday that flight EZY6945 would make an unanticipated stop at John Paul II International Airport Kraków–Balice in Poland.
"We're sorry that your flight has diverted to Krakow airport. This is due to a passenger incident, that unfortunately has resulted in your plane having to divert," EasyJet wrote in an update on its website.

"We plan to fly you to Cyprus (Paphos) when this incident has been resolved," the second update read. "Your crew will be keeping you up to date on the situation and we also recommend checking back with Flight Tracker for the latest updates."
Polish police reportedly arrested the men when that plane made its unscheduled landing, according to Cyprus Mail. The plane had been flying over Slovakia before making the diversion to remove the passengers. The flight, which was scheduled to land in Paphos at 10:20 p.m., was delayed because of the diversion. It's landing time was subsequently bumped to 1:25 a.m.  
"Such incidents are rare, [but] we take them very seriously, do not tolerate abusive or threatening behavior and always push for prosecution," an EasyJet spokesperson told BBC News Thursday. "EasyJet's cabin crew are highly trained to assess and evaluate all situations and to act quickly and appropriately to ensure that the safety of the flight and other passengers is not compromised at any time."
Drunk customers prove to be problematic for airlines. Ryanair, one of Europe's biggest airlines, announced its plans to modify the alcohol limit on airlines Thursday. Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary told The Independent that drunk passengers pose a "threat to safety."
O'Leary no longer wants airports to serve customers alcohol at airport bars before 10:00 a.m. He also requested that airport bars don't serve customers more than two drinks.
"Nobody wants to be on a flight with a couple of drunks on board creating trouble," O'Leary told The Independent Thursday. 
EasyJet isn't the only airline company to have problematic passengers disrupt its flight. 
United Airlines had complications with a customer in July. Flight 898, which was heading to New Orleans, returned to its starting location in Houston. The female passenger reportedly began yelling and banging on the plane's walls. Approximately five flight passengers tackled the disruptive customer as she began to sprint towards the cockpit from the plane's back row.   
A passenger that boarded Hawaiian Airlines in Honolulu reportedly owed the company nearly $100,000 for his disruptive behavior. The passenger, James August, began behaving disorderly while his plane was still on the tarmac in February. August threatened airline employees, his girlfriend and her children. He pleaded guilty to interfering with flight crew, according to Honolulu Star-Advertiser. August, however, claims to not remember his actions. 
A representative from EasyJet did not immediately return International Business Times' request for comment.

The French company that says its Houston-area chemical plant is spewing "noxious" smoke — and may explode — successfully pressed federal regulators to delay new regulations designed to improve safety procedures at chemical plants, according to federal records reviewed by International Business Times. The rules, which were set to go into effect this year, were halted by the Trump administration after a furious lobbying campaign by plant owner Arkema and its affiliated trade association, the American Chemistry Council, which represents a chemical industry that has poured tens of millions of dollars into federal elections.
The effort to stop the chemical plant safety rules was backed by top Texas Republican lawmakers, who have received big campaign donations from chemical industry donors.
Representatives from Arkema Americas and the American Chemistry Council did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
In 2013, a  West, Texas, chemical plant explosion killed 15 people, prompting the Obama administration to try to raise chemical plant safety standards (investigators later found the explosion was caused deliberately). In an executive order that year, President Obama  proposed an overhaul of the Environmental Protection Agency’s Risk Management Program with the goal of increasing safety and transparency at chemical plants by strengthening existing regulations. The EPA said the enhanced rules would “seek to improve chemical process safety, assist local emergency authorities in planning for and responding to accidents, and improve public awareness of chemical hazards at regulated source.”

Arkema has  six production plants in Texas and has received more than  $8.7 million worth of taxpayer subsidies from the state. Arkema’s Crosby plant — which  OSHA fined more than $90,000 for ten “serious” violations earlier this year and has spewed smoke in Crosby — appears to be covered under the existing EPA rules because of the kinds of chemicals it uses. While Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott has  given chemical companies legal cover to hide the locations of their EPA-regulated chemicals, the  Associated Press reports that the imperiled Arkema facility houses large amounts of  toxic sulfur dioxide and flammable methylpropen, which required Arkema to submit a risk management plan to the agency —  and which would have subjected the company to the strengthened safety rules.
However, those rules — which would have taken effect on March 14  — were blocked by EPA administrator Scott Pruitt, who as Oklahoma Attorney General demanded  the rule be withdrawn. The move was a big win for the chemical industry that has spent more than  $100 million supporting federal lawmakers since 2008. Among those who have received more than $100,000 from the industry are powerful Texas lawmakers  including Sen. John Cornyn (R), Rep. Joe Barton (R), Rep. Pete Olson (R), Rep. Gene Green (D), Rep. Pete Sessions (R) and Rep. Kevin Brady (R).
“Will Likely Add Significant New Costs”
Documents reviewed by IBT show that Pruitt’s announcement followed a lobbying campaign by Arkema and its colleagues in the chemical industry.
In May of 2016, Arkema sent  a letter to the EPA criticizing the proposed rule. One part of the letter said the rule’s requirement of independent risk management audits “will likely add significant new costs and burdens to the corporate audit process.” The company also took issue with the rule’s “Safer Technology and Alternatives Analysis” (STAA) requirements.
Those provisions would have required that companies consider using “inherently safer technology” that would encourage companies to “substitute less hazardous substances” and encourage firms to “simplify covered processes in order to make accidental releases less likely or the impacts of such releases less severe.”
“The additional requirement for STAA would be burdensome because there is no consensus methodology, definitions or standards for STAA,” the company told the agency. “Knowledge of ‘inherently safer technologies’ can vary greatly depending on the process being examined and the knowledge and expertise of the team performing the analysis. As a result, implementation of STAA would likely be inconsistent across companies.”
Federal records reviewed by IBT show that Arkema specifically lobbied on the chemical safety rules. In the first quarter of 2017, as the Trump administration was reviewing the rule,  federal records show the company was lobbying on “EPA chemical regulations, including Significant New Use Rules and the Significant New Alternatives Policy program and EPA Risk Management Program regulations.” The records show the company directly lobbied the EPA and the White House on the issue. In the second quarter,  federal records show Arkema lobbying the EPA and the National Economic Council on “EPA risk management program regulations.”
Of Arkema’s six production plants in Texas, five, including the Crosby plant, are near the coast and in the Houston area, raising the prospect of additional explosions due to flooding. The town of Beaumont, where there is a  taxpayer-subsidized Arkema  plant, has experienced  severe flooding. Another plant is located  in Houston, and two more, in nearby Pasadena, sit right on the Trinity Bay; one of these plants took in nearly  $5 million in subsidies.

Arkema Push To Stop Rules Gets Boost From Its Lobbying Group & From Texas Republicans
In its  letter to the EPA, Arkema noted that it is a member of the American Chemistry Council — a powerful lobbying group that has delivered  $1.6 million of campaign donations to federal lawmakers since 2010. That Arkema-backed group helped spearhead the effort to block the EPA’s chemical plant safety rule. In January, the council was one of 21 groups that sent a  letter to congressional leaders asserting that the new rule’s costs were not worth the alleged safety benefits.
“The lack of identifiable and quantifiable benefits stands in stark contrast to the clear costs associated with this rule,” said the letter. “Whether it be the requirement of third-party auditor participation that will reduce the pool of qualified auditors, changing well-established audit procedures already designed to maximize safety effectiveness, or imposing ineffective requirements to consider ‘inherently safer technology/design,’ the final rule includes a litany of costly changes that have not been shown to increase safety.”
The American Chemistry Council also lauded Texas Republican Attorney General Ken Paxton for co-authoring a letter slamming the chemical plant safety rule. The letter chastised the EPA for proposing to require chemical plants to more expansively disclose castatrophic releases of hazardous chemicals and berated regulators for requiring independent audits of facilities' safety procedures.
"To complicate matters further, EPA is demanding that the auditors have no relationship with the audited entity for three years prior to the audit and three years subsequent," wrote Paxton and Louisiana Republican Attorney General Jeff Landry. "EPA is demanding that a professional engineer be part of the auditing team, that attorney client privilege cannot apply to the audits, and finding and reports be released to the public. It is difficult to fathom how this collection of burdensome, costly, bureaucratic regulatory requirements does anything to enhance accidental chemical release prevention...This unauthorized expansion of the program does not make facilities safer, but it does subject facilities to even more burdensome, duplicative and needless regulation."
Paxton received $106,000 from chemical industry donors during his 2014 run for attorney general.  His letter was backed by then-Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt and then-Alabama Attorney General Luther Strange (now a senator),  who  argued that disclosing details of chemical accidents would imperil national security. Pruitt's campaigns were supported by the Republican Attorneys General Association -- which he chaired and which received $50,000 from the American Chemistry Council during his tenure as a state official, according to data compiled by PoliticalMoneyLine.com.
The push to persuade the Trump administration to block the chemical plant safety rules was also bolstered by an American Chemistry Council-backed  resolution introduced on February 1 by Republican Rep. Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma.
Among the 65 co-sponsors of the measure to block the rules were 10 members of the Texas Congressional delegation, including five who represent Houston area districts: Brian Babin (TX-36), whose  district encompasses Crosby, where the Arkema plant lies; Michael McCaul (R-10), chairman of the House Committee on Homeland Security, whose  district sits northwest of Houston; John Culberson (R-7), whose  district covers part of Houston; Randy Weber (R-14), who represents a coastal district just outside of Houston; Blake Farenthold (R-27), a representative whose coastal  district lies southwest of Houston. Other co-sponsors include Louie Gohmert (R-1), vice chair of the House Committee on Natural Resources, and Lamar Smith (R-21), chair of the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology who  has challenged climate science. Weber and Babin are also members of that committee.
The Texas lawmakers who sponsored Mullin’s bill to block the chemical plant safety regulations have received more than  $652,000 from the chemical industry, according to data from the Center for Responsive Politics. Federal contribution data show the American Chemistry Council specifically has delivered more than $160,000 to the entire Texas congressional delegation since 2008, with top recipients including Gene Green ($20,288), Olson ($18,999), McCaul, who co-sponsored the Mullin bill ($13,500), and Barton ($16,500). Babin and Weber, who also co-sponsored the bill, each received  $3,000 from Arkema.
Also this year, Texas Senators Ted Cruz and John Cornyn were two of 16 co-sponsors of a companion resolution in the Senate. Cornyn has taken more than $408,000 from the chemical industry over the course of his career, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Cruz has recieved $234,000 from the industry. The National Institute on Money In State Politics reports that the American Chemistry Council has given more to federal lawmakers in Texas than legislators in any other state.
ExxonMobil, Dow Chemical, Koch Industries and Saudi Basic Industries Corporation (SABIC), a Saudi government-owned firm with multiple locations in the Houston area, including its North American headquarters, all lobbied on the legislation, which set the stage for Trump's administration to block the rules.
In the lead up to that administration decision, the American Chemistry Council took its lobbying efforts directly to the EPA — along with the U.S. House and Senate, the Department of the Interior, the Office of Management and Budget and the Department of Agriculture — on both the legislation and the EPA rule on behalf of Arkema and its many other corporate sponsors. In a  May 2017 letter to the EPA, the American Chemistry Council advocated that the implementation of the safety rule be delayed for “at least eighteen months” — until February 19, 2019, arguing that the current rule would be too expensive for its members such as Arkema to implement.
“The Final Rule raises significant security concerns and compliance issues that will harm ACC members and others in the regulated community,” the trade association wrote to the EPA. “Certain provisions, such as the requirement to audit ‘each covered process’ in a facility’s compliance audit, impose costly and burdensome obligations on facilities.”
UPDATED, 4:13pm ET: Arkema originally reported that there were two explosions at its Crosby facility. Law enforcement authorities have since said there were no explosions. The company's CEO has said that there is "noxious" smoke coming from the facility. This story has been updated throughout.


Passengers on a recent Ibiza-bound flight got a smackdown from the flight’s pilot after he left the cockpit to reprimand several rowdy individuals aboard the plane. The incident occurred last week on a flight leaving Edinburgh, Scotland, after the passengers had become heavily intoxicated prior to takeoff and accosted flight crew.
The incident was  first reported by British tabloid newspaper the Sun on Tuesday and later confirmed to the Daily Mail as having occurred Saturday. The Jet2 pilot reportedly told those on the craft: “A lot of you think this is a party bus, but it is not.”
“People want a good holiday, a nice flight and not have any trouble, loud raucous behaviour and drunkenness,” the unidentified pilot said, according to the Sun. “And unfortunately this flight has started badly already with verbal aggression going on which is not going to be tolerated.”
According to one witness who recorded the incident, a man and his girlfriend “had apparently been verbally abusive to staff,” and the male passenger was later removed from the plane.
“There were a few people who were drunk,” the witness said. “A girl behind us could barely look straight.”
Some passengers commended the pilot for taking a stand and applauded after he finished speaking, the passenger told the Sun.
“We can confirm the captain made the decision to offload a male passenger from our Edinburgh flight LS805 to Ibiza on Saturday 26th August,” a Jet2 spokesperson told Daily Mail. “This was due to his increasingly anti-social and aggressive behaviour. As a family friendly airline the safety and welfare of our customers and staff is always our number one priority, as our captain demonstrated on this occasion.”
Last week’s Jet2 flight out of Edinburgh wasn’t the only Ibiza-bound flight to find passengers engaging in questionable behavior. A video of two individuals  engaging in a sexual act aboard a Ryanair flight from Manchester to Ibiza earlier this year caused a stir, though the woman later maintained that the stunt was a “lapdance.”

“I heard them talking about it but I thought they were joking. The guy was shouting, ‘Anyone got a jelly?’” witness Kieran Williams told the Daily Mail at the time. “We all laughed but then ten minutes later they actually did it. They seemed so drunk, they brought a lot of attention to themselves.”
Jet2 did not immediately return International Business Times’ request for comment.

New mothers are encouraged to breastfeed — it's good for babies' health and even keeps healthcare costs down. It's just not easy when mothers are in the workplace, let alone on a business trip. But some businesses are looking to change that. 
Kate Torgersen launched Milk Stork in 2015, a California-based breast-milk delivery service that aims to make it easier for working mothers to pump and ship breast milk to their newborns.
"Mothers are one of the fastest growing sections of the workforce," Torgersen told International Business Times in a phone interview. "Moms are pumping in bathrooms and wherever they can. It’s not something the rest of the world knows about. A working mom also needs to send her breast milk to her child while she is away."
Breastfeeding rates are increasing in the U.S., according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Breastfeeding Report Card released in 2014.  The World Health Organization advises mothers to nurse an infant from birth to six months daily. But mothers who breastfed for six months suffered greater earnings losses than women who didn’t breastfeed at all, said a report published in 2012 by the American Sociological Association with data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth. The cause: lost work-time due to the need to pump breast milk.

Mothers need to pump several times a day, requiring extra time to pump and stockpile milk during work hours. This can become more challenging if a woman travels for work.
"When you take a business trip, now all that production of milk is offsite," Torgenson told IBT. "It’s difficult to cover your absence."
Catie Trombley, a working mother from Washington D.C., had been having troubles stockpiling breast milk to feed her baby during a business trip, so she turned to Milk Stork. She discovered the service online after her father mentioned it. 
"When my maternity leave was drawing to a close, I tried it out on my first business trip away from my baby," she told IBT via email. "My daughter was 4 and a half months old and still nursing as her sole source of food. I had been diligent about pumping and freezing milk while I was on leave."
Trombley, like many traveling moms, worried that she wouldn't make it back to her baby before her milk supply diminished. Milk Stork helped her store and ship the milk that she stockpiled during travel. She embarked on a two-day trip from D.C. to California and pumped on planes, in bathroom stalls, in client offices, and at airports and used plastics bags to store them, which became messy. 
"I checked out the next morning at 9 a.m. PST with my Milk Stork cooler in hand," she said. "I took it with me everywhere I went that day and kept filling it with milk whenever I had the opportunity to pump. I made it home the next day at 7 a.m. EST with 50 ounces of milk all chilled. I was so relieved."
Working mothers are more likely to stop breastfeeding because of money loss. Mothers working between 20 hours and 34 hours a week had a 45 percent chance of stopping breastfeeding before their newborn became six months old, CBS News reported last year.
"Moms are using Milk Stork and asking their companies to reimburse them," Torgenson told IBT. "We have 60 enterprise companies on our roster. Moms have gone to their companies and asked them to pay for it. Companies want to do it to attract and retain talent. It allows a woman to resume her responsibilities."
Milk Stork charges based on size and shipping, so a 34-ounce Pump and Tote package will cost $79 plus shipping. Seventy-two ounces is the biggest Pump and Tote package, starting at $99. 
Torgenson added: "If a mother has to go on a work trip, they will offer Milk Stork’s shipping or toting services to help her get the milk back home, easing the stress before and during the trip, which supports her to keep breastfeeding."
In addition to its physical and emotional benefits, consistent breastfeeding lowers healthcare costs. If four out of five U.S. women breastfed exclusively for six months, it would save $10.5 billion in healthcare costs nationwide, a 2010 study in the journal Pediatrics concluded.
Working moms sometimes lose money when they take a break to pump and stockpile breastmilk during the workday. A mother is pictured outside the Legislative Assembly in San Jose on Aug 3, 2016 breastfeeding. Photo: Getty
Boston Scientific, a worldwide medical device manufacturer, partnered with Milk Stork through its Benefits to Fit Your Life program. It offers support to its employees and their families.    
"Boston Scientific added innovative benefits, such as Milk Stork, a breast milk shipping service for traveling, breastfeeding moms," the company told IBT in a statement. "Since the beginning of the year, 35 Boston Scientific employees have used Milk Stork’s service on 67 trips, shipping nearly 50 gallons of breast milk home."
Milk Stork hopes to normalize motherhood and breastfeeding in the workplace. 
"What’s been amazing is to see companies respect this time of motherhood and how difficult that transition can be," Torgenson said. "I love that women are coming to a place where they don’t have to ask for an accommodation. I don’t think they should have to apologize."
 


The death toll left in the wake of Hurricane Harvey  rose to as many as 30 people Wednesday as the storm made its second landfall near Louisiana.  Tens of thousands of others in the area have been affected, and recovery from the storm’s impact is expected to take years. In an effort to raise necessary funds for victims of the days-long flooding that hit Houston last week, several airlines have teamed up with disaster relief campaigns and promise miles and other promotions to persuade flyers to donate to the effort.
American Airlines partnered with the Red Cross for its relief efforts. AAdvantage members will receive 10 miles for every dollar donated to the charity after a $25 minimum contribution. American Airlines began the promotion last week, and it will run through Sept. 24. The carrier noted how each dollar amount can help victims of the disaster on its  website.
A representative for  United Airlines told International Business Times by email that the carrier is teaming up with several organizations to aid the Texas relief effort. In addition to matching the first $200,000 donated to its  CrowdRise campaign, the airline will also offer up to three million bonus miles to customers who contribute to designated relief organizations that include the American Red Cross, Airlink, Greater Houston Community Foundation, Americares as well as Operation USA. The company has already raised $1.5 million in donations.
Southwest Airlines told IBT it was offering 5 million Rapid Rewards points in a match program with its customers who donate to the American Red Cross, Team Rubicon or All Hands Volunteers. Rapid Rewards members can also donate their points to a bevy of organizations through the carrier’s website.
In addition to waiving rebooking and cancellation fees for its customers booked for travel to and from Houston through Sept. 5,  JetBlue Airways is matching  TrueBlue member point donations to benefit a charity of their choosing. The carrier noted on its website that it will match up to 250,000 points donated to Americares through Sept. 30. While members will not directly benefit, JetBlue Airways offers an alternative way to donate for those who might be on a budget.
Similarly,  Delta Air Lines told IBT that it too is allowing its members to  donate their frequent flyer miles to benefit several of its partner charities, including Habitat for Humanity, the Salvation Army and UNICEF. The airline has also set up a customer microsite to  donate directly to the American Red Cross.
Spirit Airlines, which is now fully functional in Houston again, told IBT that it is providing transportation for recovery personnel in the area. Additionally, the carrier is matching customer donations to the American Red Cross up to $50,000.
A representative for  Frontier Airlines told IBT that while it is not currently running a donation program, “on our first flight back to Houston (currently planned for Thursday morning) will have relief supplies for our Team Members and their family and friends who have been impacted.” 
Like JetBlue Airways, most major airlines are allowing customers to rebook their flights without facing additional fees. Airlines that include the aforementioned carriers have all allowed for rebooking without consequence. While some noted that the last day to rebook would be Wednesday, others have extended the booking window. A full list of specific dates  can be read at Time.
Several airlines have teamed up with disaster relief campaigns and promise miles to persuade flyers to donate to the effort. In this photo, a United Airlines Boeing 787 Dreamliner pulls up to a gate at O'Hare International Airport Photo: Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images


Jim “Mattress Mack” McIngvale turned his showroom into a shelter for victims of Hurricane Harvey, something Houston Pastor Joel Osteen was accused of not doing. More than 300 people are taking refuge inside Gallery Furniture, which is located just outside Houston, CNN reported Wednesday. The owner of the store is best known for his wacky commercials, but now he’s gaining a reputation for being charitable, too.
Mattress Mack wanted some of the people who were displaced to have a dry place to stay. “All day on Sunday we went around rescuing people out of high water stranded on overpasses. We brought about 200 people into the store that way,” Mack told CNN.
Mattress Mack took to Twitter Sunday to announce that his store was open to victims of the hurricane. The post was liked more than 50,000 times, which is double the amount of followers he has.
The business owner took to Twitter again Tuesday to announce he would take in more people in need. “For residents in need of shelter who live near Gallery Furniture Grand Parkways and can safely get here, Gallery Furniture Grand Parkway is now taking in more people in need of shelter,” he wrote. “Animals must be kenneled, and kennel kept at owner’s side. If you are in need of shelter, we invite you to safely join us at 7227 West Grand Parkway South if you can travel here safely.” Mack added: “Thank you to every volunteer, and our service men and women for their brave and unwavering compassion during this difficult time.”
“God bless,” he added Wednesday. “Staying the course/ keeping the faith.”

Mack’s daughter, Laura, praised him on Facebook. “Sometimes in life those closest to you surprise you in ways even beyond your realm of thought. Dad, it doesn't surprise me on it you opened the stores to our fellow Houstonians, you would give your last breath for another, but it still amazes me how selfless you are,” she wrote Monday. “More than any being on earth, I hope I'm half the person you are one day. During these horrific 5 days my faith in humanity has been restored over and over, and you Dad are at the top of that list.”
While Mack was praised for his generosity, Osteen, a famous televangelist, was slammed when rumors swirled he refused to open the doors open his megachurch to the tens of thousands of people in Houston who were misplaced.
He denied the accusations. “We have never closed our doors. We will continue to be a distribution center for those in need. We are prepared to house people once shelters reach capacity. Lakewood will be a value to the community in the aftermath of this storm in helping our fellow citizens rebuild their lives,” a statement from the church read Monday.
The following day, Lakewood Church shared a picture that showed refugees inside the area. “Thank you Houston. Your response has been overwhelming. We cannot thank enough the hundreds upon hundreds of volunteers who came out today!” the congregation wrote.

Enterprise Ethereum Alliance stalwart Nuco has formally announced Aion, an interoperable blockchain network and the framework allowing communication between blockchains.
Nuco is led by Matthew Spoke, who launched the Rubix Blockchain project at Deloitte back in 2014, making him one of the first people in the enterprise space to work with Ethereum; he continues to play a central role in the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance.
He said: "The hundreds of blockchains existing today will soon become thousands, then millions. Future adoption of this technology relies on a network of blockchains, both enterprise and public, and we're on our way to achieving this mission. Today's blockchains don't talk to each other at all. With Aion, blockchains will be able to federate, interoperate, and scale in a model similar to the internet itself."

In the future, blockchains will federate data and value in a hub and spoke model similar to the internet. The future of mainstream blockchain adoption will be achieved by the development of a networked, federated blockchain to integrate these separate spokes. Aion is designed to enable any private or public sector organization to:
The first phase of the Aion network development focuses on launch technologies that will be functional for the first version of the live system. The Aion network will depend on a secure proof-of-work algorithm while we continue to design and develop our neural net-backed consensus system, said a statement.

It will leverage characteristics of the Ethereum VM, modified to improve performance, and support a mechanism for AION tokens to flow seamlessly between Ethereum and a public, third-generation blockchain called Aion-1.
Michael Tang, Head of Global Digital Transformation for Financial Services at Deloitte and an Advisor to Nuco, said: "Blockchain technology will soon become integral to every industry's infrastructure, and a framework for interoperability is critical to scaled adoption. As strong supporters of innovation in this space, we are eager to witness how Aion will help enterprise blockchains realize their enormous potential."
Nuco's advisors include Vitalik Buterin, Michael Tang, Scott Robinson, and Alex Tapscott. Advisors on the Aion project include New Alchemy, led by managing director Peter Vessenes, Co-Founder of the Bitcoin Foundation. Additional advisors for Aion will be announced soon.
 


Historic rainfall and flooding in southeast Texas will cause gas prices to go up. Hurricane Harvey has shut down completely or partially at least 14 oil refineries and gas prices could rise as much as 20 cents nationally and as much as 35 cents in parts of Texas and Louisiana, according to the Washington Post Wednesday.
Patrick DeHaan, is a senior petroleum analyst with GasBuddy, a website that monitors retail gas price. He predicts a rise over the next few weeks even as Labor Day Weekend approaches and peak summer driving will taper off.
“Gas prices will go up. The national average will rise 5 to 15 cents a gallon over the next two weeks. It’s up a penny already since yesterday. Areas of the Gulf of Mexico will see prices go up between 20 and 35 cents,” DeHaan told the Washington Post Tuesday.
The average price for a gallon of gas Wednesday was $2.404, up from $2.378 Tuesday, according to the American Automobile Association (AAA). In Texas the average price of a gallon of gas was lower than the national average,  $2.219 on Wednesday and $2.161 in Louisiana.
The refineries affected represent over 17 percent of the U.S. gas production, around 3 million barrels a day, according to Tribune. Around one-third of U.S. refineries dot the coast between Corpus Christi, Texas, and New Orleans, the area most affected by the storm.
In the wake of Hurricane Katrina, which hit New Orleans at the end of August in 2005, gas prices jumped up 40 cents.
Despite crude oil prices being low, around $46 per barrel, if refining capacity is limited, gasoline prices go up. Refineries not affected by the storm will work over time and benefit from “crack spread.” The term refers to the differential in crude oil prices and the price of gas products that refineries are able to churn out. With a bottleneck created by shut down refineries in Texas and Louisiana, other refineries are able to increase their profit.
Gas prices typically begin to fall at the end of summer as people begin driving less, using less gas, and gasoline stockpile reserved for summer drivers hit the market.
U.S. oil production has hit record highs recently, able to process over 9 million barrels a day, according to the Post. High production combined with historically low crude oil prices have meant lower stocks for companies like Chevron and Exxon. Just three years ago, the per barrel price of oil was in excess of $100.


Warren Buffett, 87, is one of the most successful investors in the United States. He is the chief executive officer, president, and chairman of Berkshire Hathaway. He was named the second richest person in the country and fourth wealthiest in the world by Forbes in August 2017, with an estimated net worth of $76.9 billion.
Along with being a philanthropist, Buffett is also an excellent orator. The following are a few of his quotes, on the occasion of his 87th birthday Wednesday, which is sure to inspire young entrepreneurs across the globe, as taken from Brainy Quotes:
1. Someone is sitting in the shade today because someone planted a tree a long time ago.
2. Rule No.1: Never lose money. Rule No.2: Never forget rule No.1.
3. It takes 20 years to build a reputation and five minutes to ruin it. If you think about that, you'll do things differently.
4. In the business world, the rearview mirror is always clearer than the windshield.
5. In the 20th century, the United States endured two world wars and other traumatic and expensive military conflicts; the Depression; a dozen or so recessions and financial panics; oil shocks; a flu epidemic; and the resignation of a disgraced president. Yet the Dow rose from 66 to 11,497.

6. Chains of habit are too light to be felt until they are too heavy to be broken.
7. It's better to hang out with people better than you. Pick out associates whose behavior is better than yours and you'll drift in that direction.
8. Wall Street is the only place that people ride to in a Rolls Royce to get advice from those who take the subway.
9. I always knew I was going to be rich. I don't think I ever doubted it for a minute.
10. Basically, when you get to my age, you'll really measure your success in life by how many of the people you want to have love you actually do love you.
11. Of the billionaires I have known, money just brings out the basic traits in them. If they were jerks before they had money, they are simply jerks with a billion dollars.
12. Should you find yourself in a chronically leaking boat, energy devoted to changing vessels is likely to be more productive than energy devoted to patching leaks.
13. When a management with a reputation for brilliance tackles a business with a reputation for bad economics, it is the reputation of the business that remains intact.
14. I never attempt to make money on the stock market. I buy on the assumption that they could close the market the next day and not reopen it for five years.
15. The only way to get love is to be lovable. It's very irritating if you have a lot of money. You'd like to think you could write a check: "I'll buy a million dollars' worth of love." But it doesn't work that way. The more you give love away, the more you get.


It's no secret celebrities are rich, but it’s surprising how much money some stars make through Instagram. Celebrities are influential, and fans may be more likely to buy a product if it's publicly endorsed by someone like Beyoncé or Selena Gomez. These endorsements are advertisements, which result in a hefty paycheck deposited into the celebrity's bank account. 
Instagram advertisements create an easier way for brands to attract current and future consumers by utilizing popular celebrity talents. Instagram has over 1 million monthly advertisers, with the vast majority being small to medium-sized businesses. Instagram has higher audience engagement compared with other social media websites, according to internet marketing company Yotpo; smaller businesses like Flat Tummy Tea, Cocowhite and Bootea have used Instagram celebrity endorsements to help them grow. 
Celebrities are matched to brands based on similarities, according to MJ Pedone, the president of Indra Public Relations, whose clients have benefited from this practice.
"Celebrity endorsers are usually chosen based on the connection between the brand and the celebrity," MJ Pedone told International Business Times. "It wouldn’t make sense for a professional athlete to endorse office supplies, but it would make sense to have them endorse athletic wear, TV’s and cell phones, to name a few. Both the company and the celebrity should definitely have the commonality factor or it won’t be genuine and can backfire."
The price paid out per celebrity differs because "that number will vary based on the celebrity's popularity," according to Pedone.
The Kardashian-Jenner clan are among the highest paid stars on Instagram as they've promoted brands like Sugarbearhair — among others.

"Some companies have been known to pay $500,000 a post to get access to Kim Kardashian's 102 million Instagram followers, while Khloé and Kourtney earn up to $250,000 a post,” Pedone told IBT.

Selena Gomez rakes in the most cash for her endorsement efforts at roughly $550,000 a post. The Instagram queen boasts 125 million followers to her name, which makes her a hot commodity with top retailers.  
Gomez is a vocal spokesperson for Pantene, but she also became the newest brand ambassador for Coach in December 2016. The Disney alum's partnership with Coach has given her the creative license to cultivate her own designs for the high-end retailer. Coach's stock went up after the partnership with Gomez was solidified, Business Insider reported. Gomez's reportedly inked $10 million for her Coach partnership, according to The Hollywood Reporter.

The singer may be the highest-paid celebrity on Instagram, but following shortly behind is Kim Kardashian-West at $500,000 per post and Cristiano Ronaldo earning $400,000 per post, according to Instagram data and information website Hopper HQ. Other stars to secure spots on the list include Cara Delevingne at $150,000 per post, Gigi Hadid at $120,000 per post and LeBron James making $120,000 per post. 
But influencers don't have to be an A-list or even B-list celebrity to make money through Instagram. Dubai-based beauty YouTuber Huda Kattan is the highest-paid social influencer at $18,000 per Instagram post, according to Hopper HQ. Kattan has partnered with brands like Tweezerman to enhance her income. Other social media influencers to make the cut include Cameron Dallas at $17,000 per post, Zoella at $14,000 per post and Nash Grier reeling in $13,000 per post. 
Teami Blends uses Instagram to promote its detox tea products to approximately 431,000 followers. The brands' biggest celebrity influencer is Demi Lovato.
Lovato wrote in an April advertised post: "@teamiblends has #sponsored my 30-day detox challenge to help get rid of toxins and my bloating for summer. I'm on Day 7 right now & it's so easy! I just drink their tea every single day in my favorite purple tumbler."

Brand ambassadors, like Lovato, are chosen by Teami Blends for their aspirationally healthy lifestyles. The "Confident" singer actively shares posts of her workout regimen, body positive messages and partnership with Fabletics, which is a Kate Hudson brand. 
"We choose ambassadors because of the lifestyles they live. We promote health and happiness, and we choose those who live by that as well," Teami Blends told IBT. "Our influencers truly use and love our products, because they are all natural, and serve to help ailments that we all experience."
The company's primary goal with celebrity collaborations "is the informative exposure of our brand." The tea brand recognizes that it "can attribute a large percentage of our business to our ambassador marketing."
Instagram advertisements are supposed to be tagged properly by the celebrity or social influencer. In the past, several celebrities reportedly failed to adequately tag posts with the identifier, including Rihanna.
Public Citizen, an advocate for proper taggings of advertisements, fought for the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to enforce stricter regulations. Public Citizen argued that young consumers are "deceived" by celebrity advertisements.
"On Instagram, disguised ads are rampant; deceived consumers often believe celebrities are making genuine, self-directed and enthusiastic endorsements of brands," Public Citizen's website reads. "They don't realize that those celebrities are paid and may not even use the touted brand. These ads are often targeted at kids and teenagers, and there is clear evidence that this is an especially vulnerable group to advertising disguised as content."
Instagram has worked towards making it easier for consumers to identify advertisements on celebrity and social influencers accounts. Post identifiers marked with "#ad",  "paid partnership with" or "sponsored" are being enforced by the social app. These identifiers are being encouraged by the social app to enforce transparency in the Instagram community, which will make it easier for millennial consumers in particular to distinguish advertisements from regular posts. 
"It's the relationships people form on Instagram that foster the community and make it so unique, including partnerships between community creators and businesses," an Instagram spokesperson told IBT. "To keep this community healthy and transparent, we want to be open and consistent about paid partnerships."
Instagram doesn't reap the financial benefits of paid partnerships. It's a free service provided to businesses to cultivate "greater transparency" within the Instagram community.    
Based on the sizable amount of money in play, it's more evident than ever that it pays to be famous.

UPDATE: 3:02 p.m. – After a photo emerged that showed a Best Buy store selling cases of water for $42 in flood-ravaged Texas, the company has issued an apology for the pricing.
"This was a big mistake on the part of a few employees at one store on Friday," a spokesperson for Best Buy told International Business Times in a statement Tuesday. "As a company we are focused on helping, not hurting affected people. We're sorry and it won't happen again. Not as an excuse but as an explanation, we don't typically sell cases of water. The mistake was made when employees priced a case of water using the single-bottle price for each bottle in the case."
Original story: A Best Buy store near Houston was accused of price gouging bottles of water in the wake of Hurricane Harvey, according to a story on GritPost by Ken Klippenstein. Photos shared on Twitter allegedly of a store in Cypress, Texas, showed cases of Smart Water being sold for $29.98, while cases of Dasani water were being hocked at $42.96.
Social media users decried the apparent price gouging for vital supplies like water — though it was far from the first time prices were raised in the aftermath of the disaster. More than 500 complaints were leveled against businesses about price gouging during Hurricane Harvey over the weekend, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton told CNBC in an interview Monday.
“These are things you can’t do in Texas,” said Paxton. “There are significant penalties if you price gouge in a crisis like this.”

Price gouging can result in fines of up to $200,000, with an additional $50,000 if the victim in question was over 65 years old. Texans reported businesses driving up prices in the wake of the disaster as companies reportedly worried about supply and demand.
“I don’t think as large as our country is, as large as Texas is, that supply is ultimately going to be that big of an issue,” Paxton told CNBC.
Others reported cases of water going for up to $99. A television crew from KXAN-TV in Austin attempted to stay in a hotel about 20 miles from Corpus Christi Saturday — only to find prices at the establishment had been tripled. The Best Western Plus charged $321.89 instead of the standard $120 - $149 per night.
Multiple customers at a WingStop in Houston were overcharged over the weekend as well — patrons noticed ambiguous charges and “catering platter” fees on their receipts. General manager Estebanon Barnes acknowledged the issue and said the customers were “incorrectly charged.”
“I want to apologize to our guests who may have been incorrectly charged,” Barnes said, according to the Corpus Christi Caller-Times. “We’re working to quickly resolve this error and ensure it doesn’t happen again.”


Tuesday marked what would have been Michael Jackson’s 59th birthday. He was born in 1958 and died June 25, 2009. The King of Pop regularly topped the music charts and gave the world cult classics and popular trends. During his career, he grossed millions and sold record-breaking amounts of music.
Many renowned Jackson as one of the most prosperous artists to grace the music world. His estate has a projected net worth of $600 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth. Between 1985 to 1995, the pop star earned about $100 million annually. It was mostly from touring, endorsements, merchandise and record sales.
Posthumously, Jackson remained one of the most notable and profitable musical artists worldwide. He has sold over 750 million albums, including the 35 million units sold after his death. Jackson’s most important asset was his musical catalog, the copyright value of his songs is estimated at $100 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth. Jackson purchased the entire Beatles catalog for $47.5 million, which merged with Sony and holds an estimated value of about $2 billion.
Over the course of his life, Jackson grossed about $500 million from his own music, videos, concerts and endorsements. However, he had reportedly amassed $500 million worth of financial debt. He supposedly spent between $30 and $50 million annually on his lifestyle. More, he accumulated massive fees for lawyers and publicists during court trials. 
Jackson’s family attempted to divvy up his money and estimate. His will specifically bestowed 40 percent of his assets to his three children. His will also delegated 20 percent to various children's aid organizations, while the remaining 40 percent went to support his mother, Katherine. After Katherine's death, Jackson’s will awards the children that same 40 percent. 
Jackson’s daughter Paris, 19, took to Instagram and posted a heartfelt tribute to her father Tuesday. She posted a childhood photo and a message regarding her late father, stating that he was "the love of [her] life" and taught her "how to dream."
birthday wishes to the love of my life, the one person who showed me what passion truly was, the one that gave me solid morals to live by and how to dream. i will never feel love again the way i did with you. you are always with me and i am always with you. though i am not you, and you are not me, i know with all of my being that we are one. and our souls will never change in that way. thank you for the magic, forever and always.

Social media criticized Pastor Joel Osteen for apparently not allowing misplaced Hurricane Harvey victims to use his massive Houston-based Lakewood church for shelter over the weekend. Many questioned why the wealthy pastor refused to house the victims or publicly donate funds to relief efforts.
Osteen, 54, has an estimated net worth of $40 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth. He is also listed as the fifth-richest pastor in America, according to Belief Net. He is the senior pastor of the Houston-based Lakewood Church and claimed his position after his father and former head pastor died in 1991.
The Houston-based pastor once made an estimated $200,000 from running the church. However, he relinquished his salary in 2005. His sermons are televised worldwide and he is a best-selling author whose books have appeared on the New York Times Best Seller’s list.
His first book released in 2004, "Your Best Life Now: 7 Steps to Living at Your Full Potential," has sold more than 10 million copies, according to the Star-Telegram. His second book, "Become A Better You," grossed him $13 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth. Osteen’s book deals and tours reportedly earned him about $55 million annually.  
Social media criticized Pastor Joel Osteen for not letting misplaced Hurricane Harvey victims seek shelter in his massive Lakewood church. His mansion is valued at $10.9 million.

"I am what I am today because of what I believed about myself yesterday," his book read. "And I will be tomorrow what I’m believing about myself right now."
After an estimated $95 million in renovations, Osteen and his congregation moved into the formally known Compaq Center in 2005. The Lakewood church now seats almost 16,000 people and has about 40,000 members. The building is made up of wall-to-wall carpeting and indoor waterfalls.
Osteen’s church isn’t the only seemingly affluent property attached to his name. The Houston pastor, his wife Victoria and three children live in a 17,000 square-foot mansion, worth an estimated $10.5 million in River Oaks, according to Newsmax. His home reportedly contains six bedrooms, six bathrooms, three elevators, a pool house, five fireplaces, three elevators and a guest house.
In an interview with Oprah Winfrey on her show "Next Chapter," the Lakewood pastor talked about his wealth and how he grossed much of his money from book sales. Besides the books, he has a series of calendars, daybooks and other items that earn income. 
"It’s interesting how people usually know who’s sincere and who’s not over time — we don’t ask for money and people send in millions of dollars to help us keep the broadcast on the air," Osteen told Winfrey. "We don’t take a salary from the ministry, it comes from books and other things like that."
Winfrey asked Osteen if he "makes any apologies" for his wealth. Osteen suggested that God was responsible for his possessions and wealth. He claimed it was because his family often donated to the less fortunate.
"I really don’t, Oprah. We just feel like this is God’s blessings," he said. "You know, we’re big givers, we live what we preach, we’ve given millions of dollars. And I don’t think there’s anything wrong with having a nice place to live and being blessed."


A flight arrived at its San Francisco destination nine hours delayed this week after a rat was spotted on board the plane. The Sunday flight from Indira Gandhi International Airport in New Delhi to San Francisco International Airport had to redirect to the terminal where it was later fumigated, as per safety protocol.
The flight was originally scheduled to depart at 2:30 a.m. IST,  according to FlightAware. However, the plane did not depart until 12:02 p.m., making it more than nine and a half hours late. News of the flight interruption was  first reported Monday by the Times of India:
“Just when the plane was taxiing, the rat was spotted. By the time fumigation was being done, the maximum flying time for the crew — four sets of pilots are needed for this ultra-long haul flight — or flight duty and time limitations (FDTL) kicked in. The airline had to, at the last minute, look for a replacement crew, said a source.”
The fumigation process for the aircraft took upwards of six hours. It was not immediately clear Monday where on the plane the rat was seen or how it managed to get on the flight, though an official called the occurrence “universal” and said that rodents “follow the large storage cases in which food trays are kept.” From there, they are unwittingly lifted into aircraft.
According to the Times of India, Air India’s new chairman Rajiv Bansal has requested a detailed report of the incident.
A 2014  report from the Wall Street Journal about the frequency of rodents appearing on flights confirmed that the issue is not altogether rare. According to an official associated with a state-run pest-control company, it received “requests to fumigate four or five planes each month.”
The plane was reportedly carrying 172 passengers seated in economy and another 34 in business class. Additional time needed to locate two commanders and two co-pilots to fly the plane compounded the delay.
A similar incident delayed a  British Airways flight in March after a mouse was found on board the plane from Heathrow Airport in Longford, England, to San Francisco International Airport, causing an hours-long delay. One official pointed to the potential dangers posed by four-legged stowaways.
“Rats on board an aircraft can lead to a catastrophe if they start chewing up electric wires of a plane,” said a senior commander who spoke with the Times of India about Sunday’s event. “If that happens, pilots will have no control on any system on board leading to a disaster.”
Air India did not immediately return International Business Times’ request for comment.

Jason Mitchell, the actor best known for his depiction of rapper Eazy-E in 2015’s “Straight Outta Compton,” was reportedly detained after an altercation aboard a Delta Air Lines flight over the weekend. Video of the incident was obtained by TMZ and later posted online.
The Sunday incident occurred after Mitchell arrived late to a first flight, for which he had a first class ticket, and was offered a seat below first class on a subsequent flight, a representative for Delta Air Lines told International Business Times Monday.  TMZ reported Sunday that Mitchell originally claimed his seat aboard the carrier was double booked.
“The passenger was late checking in and missed his original flight from Las Vegas to Salt Lake City,” the airline told IBT. “He was placed on standby on the next flight and confirmed into Delta Comfort+, on the only available seat. On that flight, 2252, he got into a verbal altercation with the crew, before ultimately exiting the aircraft and being taken into custody by law enforcement.”
The airline added: “He was told prior to boarding, there were no 1st class seats available on the flight.”

During the incident, Mitchell could be heard yelling profanities at both airline staff as well as passengers in the first class area of the plane’s cabin. “P----,” “f--- you” and other insults were among those heard from Mitchell during multiple video clips of the altercation. At one point, a first class passenger could be heard asking Mitchell to leave the plane so it could depart.
In a second clip obtained by TMZ, which appeared to be taken before the above video, Mitchell could be heard threatening to “smack the f---” out of another passenger. It was not clear Monday what the circumstances around the exchange entailed.

TMZ also reported that local law enforcement had to be called. While Delta Air Lines refused to press charges, Mitchell was reportedly handcuffed and detained.
“Eyewitnesses say Mitchell eventually got off the plane, but not before cops had to get involved. Law enforcement sources tell us,” the site reported. “Mitchell was cuffed and detained when he finally left the aircraft, but Delta refused to press charges and he was released.”
In an apparent response to the public incident, Mitchell on Monday posted a profanity-laced meme that referenced a  scene from 1998’s stoner comedy Half Baked.

Financial institutions' drive to become more "experience-driven" is opening the door to potential competition from global technology giants, according the World Economic Forum.

In a report published last week, the WEF said the challenge to banks and insurers is down to large technology firms "hollowing out the value proposition of these institutions" by carrying out more core functions, even as banks and insurers lean ever more heavily on them to compete.
The report, titled "'Beyond Fintech': A pragmatic assessment of disruptive potential in financial services," also notes that fintech start-ups, while achieving success in terms of changing the basis for competition, have had less impact than expected in disrupting the competitive landscape.

Jesse McWaters, lead author of the report and project lead (disruptive innovation in financial services) at the WEF, said: "The partnership between banks and large tech companies risks not staying a reciprocal one. Financial institutions increasingly rely on technology firms for their most strategically sensitive capabilities, but can so far only offer their ongoing business in return."
The report drew on interviews and workshops with hundreds of financial and technology experts, examining cloud computing, customer-facing artificial intelligence and 'big data' customer analytics as three capabilities that are becoming critical to the competitive differentiation of financial institutions.
All three are domains where technology giants like Amazon, Google and Facebook have far deeper experience than their financial services counterparts and where scale effects will make it difficult for financial institutions to catch up, the report noted.
As a result, many banks and insurers are turning to technology firms to provide these core functions. For instance, Amazon Web Services (AWS) provides services to dozens of finance companies, including Aon, Capital One, Carlyle, Nasdaq, Pacific Life and Stripe.
Brazil's Banco Bradesco Facebook app allows customers to conduct day-to-day banking from the social network, and relies on its customer data analytics to target users. Capital One and Liberty Mutual's 'Alexa solution (a voice-activated personal assistant), which allows customers to check balances, pay bills and track spending through these devices, is another example.
While these partnerships can accelerate innovation, the report points out that they also pose a risk should large technology players choose to enter financial services in direct competition with retail banks and insurers.
"Technology giants would be able to pick and choose their points of entry into financial services; maximising their strengths like rich datasets and strong brands, while taking advantage of incumbent institutions' dependence on them," McWaters added.
As a result, financial institutions will likely need to walk a challenging line between capitalising on the services of large technology players and becoming dependent on them.
Other dilemmas are likely to surface too. For customers, the entry of large technology firms into financial services could mean entrusting both their financial and non-financial data to the same company. For policy-makers it would raise serious questions about how best to avoid both anti-competitive behaviour and the inappropriate use of personal data in decision-making.
The WEF recommends a move away from a focus on the potential competitive threat of fintech firms, which have deeply influenced the direction of innovation in the industry, as doubts were surfacing about their ability to directly challenge incumbent financial institutions.

Robo-advisers, which provide automated investment advice to customers at low fees, provide an instructive example of incumbents responding to fintech. Early innovators like Betterment and Wealthfront have shown significant growth, with assets under management of $6.7 billion and $4.4 billion, respectively, at the end of 2016.
However, they have been dwarfed by incumbents that have created their own robo-advisory offerings, such as the Vanguard Advisor platform, which had $47 billion in assets under management as of the end of 2016.
Another of the report's findings notes the emergence of distinct financial systems in China, Europe and the U.S., raising concerns for international regulatory coordination.
The report observed that, in China, large technology companies like Ant Financial (a subsidiary of Alibaba) and Tencent (the parent company of WeChat) have emerged as leading providers of a range of financial services – a striking departure from the traditional bank-led model dominant in the US.
Meanwhile in Europe, the forthcoming enactment of the Second Payment Services Directive (more commonly called PSD2) is expected to open up banks' customer data, creating an environment of more active competition between incumbents and new entrants.
"Technology is not driving a global convergence in customer experience, instead divergent customer demand and regulatory priorities are creating distinctly regionalised financial ecosystems," said Bob Contri, Industry Leader at Deloitte Global Financial Services, and an adviser to the report.
"This could pose a serious challenge to regulatory coordination, as regulators struggle to understand the disparate impact of global regulations on each region."
 


Vietnamese carrier VietJet became famous for their flight attendants wearing sexy bikinis during their travels, but the employees won’t don the salacious outfits when they fly to Indonesia. The flight attendants will be fully clothed when they fly from Ho Chi Minh City to Jakarta in December, the Jakarta Post reported Wednesday.
There was controversy around the airline in 2012 when they held a salacious contest in the middle of the flight. They were fined 20 million Dong, which translates to about $880, because of the public relations stunt, News.com.au wrote. They were not given permission by the Vietnam’s aviation authorities first.
When Ibnu Hadi, the ambassador of Indonesia, caught wind that VietJet was flying to Jakarta, he made sure the flight attendants would be covered up.
“I’d like to explain that the bikini (stunt) was only for one event. It was for the airline’s launch of their new route to Nha Trang, which is a resort city so that’s why they wore bikinis,” he said, according to a statement quoted by Indonesian broadcast program Liputan 6. “(The airline) has been reprimanded by their (the Vietnamese) government for their stunt.” He added: “VietJet is a budget airline and they will open a route to Indonesia without the bikinis. The opening of the route is still being discussed. Hopefully before the close of this year.”

The flight attendants only wear bikinis for special occasions, according to VietJet’s deputy director for commercial affairs Jay L Lingeswara. “We strongly believe and are committed to offering the best and suitable services to the Indonesian market,” he said, according to the Jakarta Post.
Bikinis or not, VietJet is raking in the dough. Nguyen Thi Phuong Thao, the CEO of VietJet, became Vietnam’s first female billionaire. “I’ve never sat down and calculated my assets,” Thao said in a March 2016 interview with Bloomberg.com. “I’m just focused on how to boost the company’s growth, how to increase the average salary for my employees, how to lead the airline to gain more market share and make it number one.”
Their success can be attributed to their PR stunts and scandalous outfits. “They've been clever about their marketing,” aviation analyst Greg Waldron of FlightGlobal told the BBC in February. “This gave them huge publicity all over the world.”
In the future, VietJet could go international. “There's no doubt that they are the dominant low-cost carrier in Vietnam,” he said. “The question is whether they can really expand that model overseas.”
But they would have to focus on their strategy. “These business models are not like McDonald's, where you can just replicate the model elsewhere,” he said. “With airlines, it's a lot more challenging: if they go internationally, this would add a huge amount of complexity to their business model. Long-haul flights would again be a completely different game.”
Currently, VietJet flies to 35 countries. Having their flight attendants wear modest attire could potentially be their first step in going international.

As the cost of prescription drugs continues to rise in the nation that already pays the most in the world for medications, federal legislators and ballot-measure committees are proposing ways to curb those prices. But pharmaceutical companies, worried their profit margins will decline under the pending proposals, are spending millions of dollars against the initiatives — and in one political bellwether state, they are employing a controversial tactic that uses shell companies to let them evade longstanding campaign finance disclosure laws.
In Ohio, the drug industry faces Issue 2, the Ohio Drug Price Relief Act — a citizen-initiated ballot measure designed to prevent state agencies, including the state Department of Medicaid, from purchasing drugs at rates any higher than the lowest amount paid by the federal Department of Veterans Affairs, which negotiates with drug companies and saves between 20 and 24 percent on drug costs. Proponents of the measure say it would save taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars per year, while detractors say it would actually raise drug prices and reduce access to medications.
To oppose Issue 2, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), the biggest trade organization in the U.S. representing major drug companies, created a political action committee on May 1 called Ohioans Against the Deceptive Rx Ballot Issue. On the same day, PhRMA also founded a limited liability corporation of the same name and registered at the same address;  under normal circumstances, it would not be required to disclose its donors. Campaign finance reports document only one donor to the ballot measure committee: the linked LLC. With the LLC’s individual corporate donors being hidden, PhRMA is wading into a legal gray area: The committee is revealing its donor, the LLC, but not the true sources of the funds given to the LLC.
"We’ve said from the start that our campaign was primarily being funded by the pharmaceutical companies," said Dale Butland, spokesman for Ohioans Against the Deceptive Rx Ballot Issue, responding to questions of secrecy.
“Certainly, setting up an LLC to launder drug company money into fighting the ballot measure looks like an effort to evade Ohio's transparency and disclosure laws,” Brendan Fischer, director of federal and Federal Election Commission reform at the nonpartisan Campaign Legal Center, told International Business Times in an email.
Donors Use Corporations To Hide Their Identities
PhRMA’s Ohio maneuver spotlights how so-called “dark money” groups are creating new ways to get around state campaign finance laws after two federal court decisions in 2010, most notably Citizens United, allowed unlimited corporate and union money in elections. These 501(c)(4) “social welfare” nonprofits, which are supposed to spend less than half their resources on political issues but are rarely held accountable by the gridlocked Federal Election Commission (FEC), are not required to disclose their donors. Independent political operatives have used these organizations to fund super PACs, which are required to disclose their contributors, while hiding the names of the original donors.
Another method of hiding political donors’ identities, which is becoming increasingly common, is using limited liability companies as “ghost corporations” to fund super PACs and even campaign committees. In March 2016, the gridlocked FEC was evenly split on whether to investigate big donations to a Mitt Romney-supporting super PAC made in 2011 by mysterious LLCs. Because of the tie vote, the commission closed the case, signaling to donors that the sources of money funneled through LLCs would not be scrutinized.
But the plaintiffs who filed a lawsuit demanding the FEC investigate the pro-Romney LLC donations — the Campaign Legal Center and fellow government watchdog Democracy 21 — sued the FEC for its inaction, and in March 2017, a federal district court quashed the FEC’s attempt to have the case thrown out.
The Campaign Legal Center contends that hiding donors this way at the federal level violates the Federal Elections Campaign Act, which prohibits “straw donors.” Section 325 of the FECA reads, “No person shall make a contribution in the name of another person or knowingly permit his name to be used to effect such a contribution.” Violating this provision at the federal level can be a criminal offense. (Here, “person” refers to an individual, partnership, committee, association, corporation, labor organization, or any other group.)
“Failure to enforce the straw donor provisions would be extremely troubling,” said Adav Noti, Campaign Legal Center's senior director for trial litigation and strategy. “The straw donor bans exist for the obvious reason of preventing people from giving money in secret... If you can hide your contributions, you’re completely undermining the entire purpose of financial disclosure.”
In a more recent instance of straw donations, a California real estate agent formed Children of Israel LLC in 2015 in order to launder the political contributions of one individual. The LLC ended up giving $150,000 to a super PAC supporting then-presidential candidate Mike Huckabee, $400,000 to a pro-Ted Cruz super PAC and the maximum allowed amount for an individual — $334,000 — to the Republican National Committee. In April 2016, The Intercept discovered the source of the LLC’s money via a twice-amended filing from the RNC: Saul Fox, a California private equity CEO whose firm itself is an LLC.
Ashley Balcerzak of the Center for Responsive Politics found that 840 LLCs donated roughly $21 million to presidential campaigns and super PACs in 2016, nearly double the amount spent in 2012.
This year, the FEC asked Donald Trump’s campaign to clarify who was behind 140 different LLCs that gave money — a total of $91,000 — directly to his campaign in the 2016 election. But most of the LLC money that entered the presidential race went towards independent spending groups, mostly super PACs. Outside groups supporting Trump took in $1.6 million from LLCs.

A Booming ‘Ghost Company’ In Ohio
Ballot measure committees in states like Ohio and California have no contribution limits but are required to report their contributors. Through LLCs — or nonfunctioning companies that act as ghost corporations — major pharmaceutical companies are hiding their names as they bankroll an expensive effort to crush the Ohio Drug Price Relief Act.
One detail that could embarrass the corporate donors is the fact that, despite the name of the anti-Issue 2 corporation — Ohioans Against the Deceptive Rx Ballot Issue LLC, a “wholly-owned subsidiary of PhRMA” — not one of PhRMA’s member companies is actually headquartered in Ohio. Most of the donors are PhRMA members, based on the available information and statements from the “No on 2” group’s communications director.
While most donors remain secret in the Ohio effort, two companies voluntarily disclosed their donations to the LLC in recent corporate reports. According to the Columbus Dispatch, California-based Amgen gave $6.3 million from 2016 through June 2017, and Biogen, headquartered in Massachusetts, gave $1.5 million last year. This accounts for roughly half of the $15.8 million total that PhRMA’s LLC raised in just May and June to fight Issue 2. With a November 7 election, the funds will almost certainly continue to flow heavily.
The coalition backing the “No on 2” effort includes the Ohio Hospital Association, the Ohio Chamber of Commerce and the Columbus branch of the NAACP.
In 2016, PhRMA set up a very similarly named committee, Californians Against the Misleading Rx Ballot Measure, which raised over $111 million for its campaign against a California initiative that, like Ohio’s, would have blocked that state from paying higher drug prices than those negotiated by the Veterans Affairs Department. The trade group set up a political action committee in California to which pharma companies donated directly — so PhRMA had to disclose these donors. Merck, Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson gave over $9 million each; Amgen gave $7.6 million; and 19 other drug companies gave $1 million or more. The PhRMA-run committee spent nearly all of the millions it raised, and the measure failed to pass, with 53 percent of voters shooting it down. All donors except for Genentech and Gilead Sciences are PhRMA members, and only a handful of companies out of more than 30 total corporate donors are headquartered in California.

Supporting Issue 2 is a committee called Ohio Taxpayers for Lower Drug Prices. The nonprofit took in close to $3.7 million through June, almost entirely from the Los Angeles-based AIDS Healthcare Foundation run by Michael Weinstein, the financier behind a similar 2016 California ballot measure. His controversial foundation gets most of its revenue from “adjacent businesses” — pharmacies and clinics — that provide primary care to roughly 41,000 patients, according to the New York Times Magazine. This income funds free care for more than 700,000 international HIV patients.
Ohio Taxpayers for Lower Drug Prices argues that the measure would save Ohio residents $400 million per year. Sen. Bernie Sanders, for whom lowering drug costs is a top priority, has endorsed Issue 2. Sanders’ own bill in the U.S. Senate to allow drug imports from Canada would save the federal government more than $6 billion, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.
Holding Big Pharma Accountable
An Ohio voter and proponent of Issue 2 filed an official complaint with the state elections commission against PhRMA, its ballot committee and its LLC on August 2. The suit alleges that PhRMA’s LLC “is a political action committee under Ohio law, because it is a combination of two or more persons with a primary or major purpose to oppose [the ballot measure] through express advocacy.” Therefore, the suit says, the LLC is in violation of the law for failing to register as a PAC with the Ohio Secretary of State; if it did register, it would be required to disclose details on its donors.
“These three entities have deliberately concocted a scheme to attempt to hide the identities of the individual drug companies that have contributed millions of dollars in an effort to defeat ODPRA,” reads the complaint. “The people of Ohio deserve to know the identities of these drug companies.”
“If the LLC's major purpose is to act as a pass-through to funnel pharma's money into the ballot fight, then the LLC may have to register as a political committee and file disclosure reports,” said Fischer.
Ohio’s campaign finance handbook says that LLCs may make contributions, but such groups need to accompany any donation with detailed information of each partner, owner or member and their allocated portion of the contribution. Recipients of these funds need to itemize each individual donation.
The Ohio secretary of state’s office, however, says the practice is legal, since state campaign finance law does not restrict donations based on tax designation, including 501(c)(6) organizations like PhRMA’s LLC. But if the office is incorrect, and PhRMA has broken the law, there needs to be “proper enforcement that should involve disclosure of donors and some sort of penalty,” said Noti.
Fischer said he doesn’t see any legal problems with the AIDS Healthcare Foundation funding the “Yes on 2” ballot committee. Since the foundation’s revenue comes from its own business operations, there’s nothing else to disclose. If other donors were funneling money through the foundation, that would be a problem, Fischer said. Some individual donors gave small amounts to the ballot committee, but this does not appear to be happening with the foundation itself.
As the ballot fight continues, the drug industry faces another battle as well: A lawsuit filed in June by the Ohio attorney general alleges that pharmaceutical companies Purdue Pharma, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, Johnson & Johnson, Endo Health Solutions and Allergan — all PhRMA members except Endo — sponsored marketing campaigns that misled doctors and patients about the dangers of opioid addiction and overdose. Allergan, Johnson & Johnson and Purdue combined to give nearly $16 million to the PhRMA-run ballot measure committee that successfully opposed the California ballot measure last year.


Uber on Sunday selected Dara Khosrowshahi, the chief executive of an online travel platform Expedia Inc, as the company’s new CEO. Ending the company’s contentious search, Khosrowshahi was chosen by the board of directors at Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] following the board meetings over the weekend, according to two sources having the knowledge of the decision, reports said.
He would replace former CEO Travis Kalanick, who was forced to step down in June following a tiff with a shareholder.
Khosrowshahi, 48, an Iranian-born American businessman has been the CEO of Expedia since 2005 when the global online travel platform saw rapid expansion. He completed his graduation from Brown University, a private Ivy League research university in Providence, Rhode Island, and he has previously worked at media and internet company InterActiveCorp (IAC), and investment bank Allen & Company.
Khosrowshahi was picked among three finalists after a weekend of board meetings, according to anonymous sources, the New York Times reported. Earlier on Sunday, the leading candidate, former General Electric (GE) CEO Jeff Immelt, announced on Twitter that he had "decided not to pursue a leadership position at Uber," after it was made clear that he did not have enough support from the board, sources familiar with the decision-making process told the Washington Post.
In his Twitter post, Immelt added: "I have immense respect for the company & founders - Travis, Garrett and Ryan" (the first names of Kalanick, Garrett Camp and Ryan Graves). The board had been quite supportive of another top contender Meg Whitman, the CEO of Hewlett Packard Enterprise, who also said earlier this month that she was not keen on taking the job. But speculations suggested she resurfaced as a leading contender after Immelt's withdrawal. 
Khosrowshahi is respected in the Silicon Valley for handling the huge expansion of Expedia Inc. to over 60 countries, reports suggested. After he took over Expedia, he successfully battled recessions that hampered people's travel budgets and upstarts like Airbnb, which attempted to take away its business. Before working at Barry Diller's IAC, he worked in the banking industry.
He has been known for his outspoken criticism about President Donald Trump. Earlier this year, he condemned Trump’s travel ban that mainly barred travelers from Muslim majority countries from entering the country. "It is important to have safe borders, but at the same time, we can’t forget what brought us here. This is an immigrant nation," he told the Financial Times earlier this year. The Iranian-born businessman moved to the United States along with his family at the age of four as a refugee after the Iranian revolution.
Following his selection, sources familiar with the matter told the Washington Post he would help the struggling ride-share company in two important ways. Firstly, Khosrowshahi is considered to be low-key and "even-keeled" as compared to Uber's former CEO, who has had several instances where he was known to fly into fits of anger while handling a situation.
"My whole life, anytime I've faced a high-pressure decision, my model for mature behavior has been, 'what would Dara do'? He's one of the humblest and most even-keeled people I know," Ali Partovi, an entrepreneur, and technology investor, who is Khosrowshahi’s second cousin, told the Washington Post. The two were said to have attended primary school together in Iran.
Secondly, if Khosrowshahi accepts the offer, he would have his hands full. Since Uber has been embroiled in controversies for about a year, he would be responsible for transforming the company’s work culture and business. Several controversies about Uber made the headlines in the last eight months including sexual harassment and discrimination allegations against the ride-share giant that led to the resignation of the former CEO, according to Forbes.


United Airlines faced a bizarre lawsuit Friday, wherein a customer named William J. Dicks accused one of the airline's workers of humiliating him with unsolicited sex talk over his name.
According to a report in the New York Post, the worker taunted the Milwaukee man for nearly 48 minutes. 
Dicks was “reminded of the trauma he suffered as a child when he was teased because of his last name” during the Feb. 15 phone call, which he made to the airline to get information about his flight the next day to New Orleans, the lawsuit filed in Wisconsin federal court says, according to the New York Post.
The worker allegedly told Dicks during the call that his last name was “controversial” but that “he liked it.” He also asked him if he “was alone" and "what he would do to the agent if they were alone together.” The worker also asked Dicks whether he used “protection” with his then-girlfriend, the lawsuit claims.
The worker later asked Dicks details about his social media accounts so that he could check out his photos. 
In the lawsuit, Dicks claimed the agent’s “statements went entirely beyond information pertinent” to his flight. “Though utterly humiliated, [Dicks] remained on the phone with [United’s] reservation agent until he gained his necessary flight information,” the court papers say.
Dicks said in the lawsuit that he feared the reservation agent might try to get in touch with him again or even show up at one of the airports in Milwaukee or New Orleans as he had all his personal information.
According to Dicks, he had informed United Airlines and the United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission about the incident but he got “very little information.”
The lawsuit alleges the embarrassing phone call caused Dicks' “emotional well-being and sense of self-worth to suffer.” The disturbing phone call also led to his break up with his girlfriend, the New York Post reported.
Dicks is now suing for invasion of privacy, unlawful use of telephone and obscene or harassing telephone calls. 
International Business Times reached out to United Airlines for comments, but the airline is yet to respond to the incident. It is also unclear whether the reservation agent still works with the airline.
This is not the first time that United Airlines has come under fire from a customer. The latest incident comes amid a series of controversies surrounding the airline in the United States.
Earlier this week, a Virginia woman claimed United Airlines staff denied her access to medical supplies she needed for her 18-month-old special needs son following a delay on a Norfolk-bound flight.
The 24-year-old woman said that her infant son, Easton, suffered from chromosomal conditions and the staff did not allow her access to her baggage. However, the airline denied the allegation, and said in a statement to International Business Times: "United Flight 1735 from Chicago O’Hare to Norfolk required a new aircraft following a mechanical issue with the initial aircraft. During the delay, a customer requested that we retrieve her checked baggage as it contained supplies for her son. Due to the aircraft change, our customer had to retrieve her checked bag at baggage claim, which prevented her from flying to Norfolk.”


A new study has revealed the value of purchasing cheap flights over other potential vices to buyers looking to score a deal. According to the survey, a significant percentage of Americans — nearly half — value discounted airfare more than they do sex.
A  Priceline survey reported Wednesday by Travel and Leisure surveyed men and women between the ages of 18 and 69 regarding their feelings about cheap flights. Forty-four percent of respondents who booked a flight in the last year said that “the feeling that they get when they save money on a flight is better than sex.”
Thirty-seven percent of respondents reported feeling happy overall about saving money on airfare, and a quarter of those polled reported feeling accomplished after purchasing discounted flights.
Travel and Leisure reported that 69 percent of respondents said booking a cheap flight was better than binge watching, and 59 percent reported that it was better than a first date. Another 70 percent of those surveyed for the poll said that they favored purchasing a cheap flight over drinking beer or wine.

According to  separate data from Priceline included in a Wednesday press release, 70 percent of Americans consider themselves “masters” of finding flight deals. Ninety percent reported feeling that they’d gotten the best possible deal on airfare while booking in the last year. But the booking company said that in spite of confidence of buyers in their own ability to track down cheap flights, shoppers may be “leaving money on the table.”
Priceline listed several ways that potential flyers can ensure they’re getting the best possible deal on flights. The booking site pointed to Cheap Flight Day — which falls on Aug. 23 but is more of a window of time than a single day — as one of the best ways that travelers can save.
As International Business Times  previously reported, Cheap Flight Day is the time around which most airlines begin to lower their fares after coming off of a peak travel period in the summer and continues through November. Airlines are known to drop their fare premiums significantly during the period of time.
Online travel company CheapOair this week released  projected savings on flights to premiere destinations. Purchasing airfare during the timeframe could lead to hundreds of dollars saved on international flights and $20-50 in savings on domestic travel. International destinations listed by CheapOair for which buyers could look to save on travel were Paris, Rome, Bangkok, Madrid and Barcelona.
In addition to taking advantage of seasonal discounts, Priceline also advised buyers to pay attention to the days of the week they’re booking.
“Americans believe Tuesday is the cheapest day of the week to book a flight according to the survey and the most popular day for priceline.com bookings,” the company said. “However, the cheapest day of the week to book holiday travel according to priceline.com data is actually Friday followed closely by Thursday!”


Confederate flags are reportedly seeing a surge in sales. Alabama Flag & Banner, the last Confederate flag retailer in the United States, claims that the controversy from Charlottesville, Virginia, has benefitted its sales.
The small shop has seen an increase in sales following the protests in Charlottesville over the removal of Confederate General Robert E. Lee's statue, according to CBS News. However, sales will likely remain steady as the push for the removal of more Confederate monuments occur, CBS News reported. 
Belinda Kennedy, the owner of Alabama Flag & Banner, spoke with International Business Times Friday about the sales spike she's seen within her Huntsville, Alabama, business. 
"By and large, the comments I hear from customers coming into our store, over the phone or by email are buying flags in order to offset the small minority who are demanding the removal of monuments, changing names of streets, schools, and buildings, wanting to deface mountains, and general trying to revise history," Kennedy told IBT. "The sales we are seeing are from all 50 states and several different countries."
"I have no intention of stopping our manufacturing," Kennedy said. "We are currently the only U.S.-based manufacturer of the flag.  Our customer base includes mom-and-pop shops that do not want to sell China-made products but do want to continue to carry a full line of historic flags."
She added, "We are their only source for some of these flags.  I do not see the demand for these flags decreasing any time in the near future."
The sales boost shouldn't come as a surprise. Retailers nationwide have halted the production of Confederate flags because of push-back from people in opposition to it. Convicted shooter Dylann Roof's 2015 rampage at the Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, South Carolina, became a cause of concern for major retailers. This incident led retailers to rethink selling Confederate flags to consumers.
Amazon, Walmart, Etsy, eBay and Sears announced its intentions to place a ban on the sale of Confederate flags following the Charleston controversy. A Google spokesperson told Recode in 2015 that the tech company also planned to remove the Confederate flag from advertisements and Google Shopping.
The removal of Confederate monuments will likely move forward. A list of government officials in support of the removal of Confederate monuments is expanding country-wide, according to Reuters. Mayors of Baltimore and Lexington, Kentucky, intend to follow through with removal plans. Officials in Memphis, Tennessee, Dallas and Jacksonville, Florida, also announced its plans to push for the removal of Confederate statues. 
The flag has served as a symbol associated with racism for many. However, those in support of the flag advocate its significance in U.S. history. Confederate flag enthusiasts have had a harder time obtaining it because of the nationwide production halt, as a result. 
The removal of Confederate statues nationwide has likely increased the demand for shops like Belinda's to cultivate more flags. 
"We started having an influx in business and none of the major manufacturers were willing to sell the stock they had — they weren't willing to continue production on Confederate flags," Kennedy told AL.com in a 2015 interview. "My responsibilities to my customers is to fill their needs when they want it and I had customers wanting it. I wasn't going to turn them away as I felt I had been turned away. We just decided to start cranking them out of our presses, cutting and sewing."
Kennedy added, "It's no different from a Betsy Ross flag, a Bennington flag, [or] any of the historic flags. It's simply a historic flag. It's not hate, it's history. It's a symbol of things that happened in the past and hopefully, we've learned from the past. The people that are making it a racial issue are pushing an agenda."

A Georgia woman who was prohibited from boarding an American Airlines flight Wednesday because of her oxygen tank claimed she was unable to get home. Betty Lewis told local news that she was stuck in St. Louis after the airline refused to let her get on her flight and went as far as to suggest she spend hundreds of dollars on a different tank that she cannot afford.
Lewis told Fox-affiliate KTVI that she was able to board a United Airlines flight Aug. 10 from Atlanta to Chicago but was unable to continue to get back home after attempting to board on American Airlines. The news station identified Lewis as “oxygen tank dependent.”
“They told me that I could not take it on with me!” Lewis said. “That I could not board the plane with oxygen on. I’m like, you got to be kidding me.”
Reached for comment by International Business Times, the airline said that the type of oxygen tank that Lewis uses is not permitted on flights, as per Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulations.
“This type of oxygen tank is not permitted on any commercial aircraft under federal regulations. This is not an airline policy, but set by the FAA,” an American Airlines representative told IBT. “She did not fly to St. Louis on American — so I can’t speak to why she was permitted to fly with the oxygen.”
The airline did not provide any other details to IBT about how the incident was handled.

KTVI said it reached out to United Airlines about why Lewis had been able to board a flight if her oxygen tank fell outside of FAA regulations and was reportedly forwarded to the carrier’s policy.
Lewis was in St. Louis after traveling by car from Chicago to visit her aunt, she said. She was scheduled to fly home from St. Louis Lambert International Airport before her plans were foiled. American Airlines provided her with hotel accommodations for the evening, and she was told to return Thursday to make other flight arrangements. However, Lewis was told upon returning that she should purchase a tank that can cost up to $400.
Lewis said that she can’t afford a flight with another carrier, and it was not clear Friday whether she had been able to get home.
American Airlines has made headlines in recent weeks for several other incidents. The airline is presently facing a lawsuit by from a woman who claims one of the carrier’s flight attendants deliberately  destroyed her wedding dress. In a separate incident, a man was served what he described as “the worst meal I’ve ever been offered in a premium cabin” after  ordering a lobster roll. The airline later told IBT the meal was not up to its standards and issued an apology.


Blockchain  platform  MultiChain  1.0 has been released, and with it details of a wide-ranging partner programme.
MultiChain 's partner programme, which includes the likes of Accenture,  Cognizant  and Medici Ventures, is split into  platform partners  who develop applications for third parties on the  MultiChain  platform, and  product partners  who are using  MultiChain  in their own proprietary solutions.
MultiChain is currently being used for three main classes of blockchain use case: lightweight financial systems, internal data security, and interorganisational record keeping or aggregation.

This categorisation is informed by founder Dr Gideon Greenspan's close analysis of the blockchain space, as well as continual feedback from MultiChain users (the release of MultiChain1.0 was actually delayed to accommodate a long list of feature requests from users).
A governing factor in deciding how blockchains might best be deployed concerns the privacy of data transacted on them. Asked what he considers to be the best approach to privacy, Dr Greenspan said: "I think the strongest technology currently out there for privacy in blockchainasset transactions is zero knowledge proofs, as implemented in zk-SNARKs.
"These are designed to hide everything about a transaction: the entities, assets and quantities involved. That kind of combination isn't present in any of the other technologies which solve only part of the privacy problem."
Zero knowledge proofs, where the proofs themselves are visible to everybody but what's being proved is invisible, have a downside in terms of their computational burden, said Greenspan, but in the long run they look like the strongest candidate for a privacy technology to be integrated into MultiChain.
Adding layers of privacy is one approach; another is the modified version of a distributed ledger presented by R3 Corda, where data is only shared between parties that need to see it.
"The Corda architecture is interesting," said Greenspan. "Essentially it doesn't have a blockchain; there is no global picture that everybody sees in terms of data or transactions. Instead everyone sees just those pieces of information that their transactions depend upon.
"I think this approach goes some way to solving the privacy problem, although not completely. People are still seeing transactions that don't involve them, because their own transactions depend on others' past ones. But Corda is also working on leveraging Intel's secure computing environment to achieve something quite similar to zero knowledge proofs, using CPU hardware rather than cutting edge cryptography."
"What you lose with these techniques is this ability for all the participants to see the whole picture, and often you want them to have that picture - not just what they've got, but what other people have, and what else is going on in the blockchain.
"But overall I think Corda is a well designed architecture which suits a certain set of heavyweight financial use cases very well."
Asked if he saw any future collaboration between R3 and MultiChain, Greenspan said there could be a possible integration point with the Corda architecture's notion of notary services. This is a kind of pluggable interface where you can choose how the spending of unspent transaction outputs are notarised and who notarises them, in order to prevent a double spending. "You can have all sorts of systems to provide that notification and it would certainly be possible to provide a notary services solution based on MultiChain."
Taking a step back, Greenspan said that table-thumping conversations around blockchainarchitectures reflect the immaturity of the space. "If you look at other complicated software tools, for example in the database space, there are tons of trade-offs between different platforms; each design decision gives you certain things, and takes away others.
"One classic trade-off is between relational and non-relational databases. You get advanced indexing and querying for free in relational databases, but you lose scalability for dealing with really large data sets.
"So it's just the same with different types of blockchain for different sets of use cases. I think the decision for which blockchain to use for a particular use case should be made on technical rather than tribal considerations, on how well that particular blockchain architecture suits what you want to achieve."
Crypto news is the gift that just keeps giving: a typical week might include the SEC stepping on ICOs, Bitcoin forking or Ethereum being hacked. Greenspan said the recent Parity bug plays a little to the strengths of MultiChain, which is not a smart contracting platform, focusing instead on more straightforward types of transactions.
"The Parity bug underlines the danger of taking some code written by a human being, however talented, and trying to make that code unchangeable and immutable," he said. "People make mistakes when programming, and many of those mistakes are only discovered once a program is in use – sadly that's just a fact of computing life."
In the long term methodologies and stronger tools will be developed to solve this for Ethereum, while in the meantime new types of blockchain such as Tezos are in the offing, defined around formally verifiable code rather than general purpose code.
"One of the ideas behind the Tezos architecture is that it's going to provide a much more restrictive programming model for writing smart contracts. So the behaviour will be more predictable and more easily formally analysed."
Ethereum smart contracts are often beset by a variety of uncertainties such as re-entrancybugs, where a piece of code runs fine unless it calls some other piece of code, which then unexpectedly calls back into it.
"Reentrancy is a common thing to worry about when you are writing software; you need to decide whether a piece of code is reentrant or not. Reentrancy can create all sorts of unpredictable behaviour if you don't think about it deeply and formally."
Providing a more restrictive programming language and more restrictive paradigms can prevent these types of problems, for example by forcing the programmer to declare whether or not a function can be re-entered or not.
"Building a great smart contracting platform is about designing a language where security is the number one consideration," noted Greenspan. "For now with Ethereum, the languages that people use are pretty close to JavaScript or Python, which are very easy for programmers to work with, but don't lead naturally to thinking about all these security issues and preventing them from happening."


If you follow the news in the crypto space – Bitcoin divided, Parity wallets hacked – it's not surprising the recent Tezos fundraiser attracted so much attention. Tezos is a smart contract blockchain platform created by Arthur and Kathleen Breitman, which recently raised $232m (£177.9m, €196.9m).
It's worth remembering two key problems Tezos sets out to solve. It presents a way to carry out decentralised upgrades to its protocol via an on-chain voting system, addressing the governance problem inherent to decentralised systems and the likelihood of contentious forking scenarios. It also proposes a more restrictive programming model for writing smart contracts, so their behaviour will be more predictable and more easily formally analysed.

The recent Parity bug was a reminder that even the most talented coders can make mistakes and smart contracts require formal methods of verification. "We had an eye from the beginning on formal verification and formal methods," said Arthur Breitman.
"Even if you're a great programmer bugs are going to happen, and the only way we can guard against this is by using formal methods: rigorous mathematical proofs that a program does what we want it to do."
"The most advanced proof assistant, Coq, is written in OCaml, the same language used to develop Tezos, so there are affinities between the two communities".
Tezos is also presenting a decentralised systemthat can deploy upgrades automatically, like in Chrome or Windows, "but instead of having the upgrades signed by your vendor – because there is no central vendor – the upgrade is, in some sense, signed by everyone who is using the protocol".
He made a clear distinction between the Tezos governance system and its proof of stake consensus. "To have a system like this you need to start with proof of stake [PoS] because proof of work creates a political class or miners whose interest may differ from token holders.
"But PoS, by itself, isn't sufficient for governance. There is a misconception that PoS consensus can be used as-is for governance.
"If you try to use consensus over chain branches as governance you end up with a kind of Keynesian beauty contest. You win if you follow the herd, and that doesn't have anything to do with merit. It doesn't have anything to do with what branch you prefer, it has to do with what branch you think is the Schelling point, the most natural one."
Arthur explained the Tezos governance system starts off with proposals, which anyone can make. They are then rated using approval voting. "Several proposals are made and people who own tokens indicate the ones they like and dislike.
"You then take the one with the highest approval rating and you submit it to another vote to pass it. Tezos requires something like a 70% majority in order to adopt a proposal, which then undergoes testing for a month. If the testing phase goes well, then a second confirmationvote is held before adoption."
"Crucially, there is no penalty if you support a version that doesn't end up winning."
He said this is only the very first layer, and the process will look to improve the governance model itself, as well as the ledger. For instance, some proposals and decisions that are not critical will not require a full referendum vote.
"You can have something like elected representatives making decisions over some narrow technical aspects of the ledger, for instance. So we can progressively build on that very simple governance layer, a more complex and better adapted governance structure."
Asked about the ICO, the team made the point that a high volume of tokens must be distributed in order to set up a wide proof of stake network. Co-founder Kathleen Breitman said: "Proof-of-stake lacks the elegant distribution that Bitcoin has. So the easiest way to bootstrap the network was this type of fundraiser, with the side benefit of endowing a non profit with funds that can help promote these technologies – in this case for quite some time."
She said it's important to distinguish this process from people who might be thinking about doing a Series B for their company and decide it's easier to just crowdfund it.
Arthur Breitman added that some people said it was irresponsible not to "cap" the funds raised. But to have done so would have meant the majority of tokens would have been snapped up by professional ICO scalpers looking only to make a quick arbitrage, rather than reaching a network of participants.
Arthur Breitman, co-founder and CTO of DLS, said: "When we started, a whole coterie of people in the space insisted there ought to be a cap on the fundraiser. Otherwise it's irresponsible they said, never exactly articulating a good reason why. They've made up this idea that some sort of self-imposed cap is a kind of duty, and attempt to back their argument with poorly understood business principles sprinkled with moralistic undertones. Not having a cap felt like crossing a picket line."
Breitman believes imposing a cap of, say, $5m when people want to contribute $50m turns the process into race whereby a professional industry of ICO scalpers grab all the tokens to book some 1,000% returns.
"The absurd practice of letting professional scalpers capture most of the value of these projects is basically killing analysis technical due diligence in the space. At best, it's often reduced to superficial indicators, like the number of stars on GitHub, instead of actually doing an in-depth analysis of the value proposition of a technology, or how well it's implemented."
Regarding the distribution of tokens across participants in the fundraiser, he said there were some 30,000 wallets created.
"The Gini coefficient, a statistical measure of disparity within a statistical sample, is about 0.87, similar to the Ethereum fundraiser, a bit higher than the distribution of wealth in the US – so it's not a surprising number."
In terms of next steps, Arthur said from technical standpoint there needs to be a few security audits, and the network needs to be polished ready for launch. "I think the path to doing that is very clear, whereas the path to growing Tezos into a much larger project is still a little new," he revealed.
Kathleen added: "We've been helping out the Foundation by reaching out to people who might be a good fit for the team and the ecosystem. The next three or four months you are probably going to hear a bit from the dev team, but the next month or so it will heads down and getting the right people at the table."

Financial technology provider FlexTrade has launched a best execution platform to ensure the best possible results for clients when orders are executed, planned, monitored and proven during the full trading life cycle.
Andy Mahoney, head of sales at FlexTrade UK, said: "Our FlexTRADER EMS is built for best execution. With MiFID II approaching, we have tied together our 3rd party integration program, expanded into fixed income, and added enhancements to our TCA application, FlexTCA, to provide our view on best execution across the asset classes."
Newsweek is hosting an AI and Data Science in Capital Markets conference on December 6-7 in New York.  Photo: NewsweekMediaGroup
The platform provides clients with a customised workflow to help them to achieve best execution, said a statement. This workflow provides traders with data from both transactional and market sources along with market intelligence from integrated third parties, all whilst capturing the complete trade in real-time to later provide data for analysis.
In addition, the site provides relevant news and content regarding MiFID II legislation, including FlexTrade's customised MiFID II compliance solution, answers to commonly asked questions regarding inducements and informative blog post updates.
With only four months to go until the MiFID II's 3 January 2018 implementation date, buy-side firms are facing huge changes in disclosure and transparency requirements, which could upend their data management architectures. It's fair to say this is something firms are wrestling with.
By raising the bar on market transparency, MiFID II has created a huge data management problem for buy-side and sell-side firms, particularly for investment managers. They need to take in a lot of data from the various venues to provide disclosures to their clients and to their national competent regulators. Transaction reporting is necessary for all financial instruments on a T+1 basis, but while MiFID I had 20 fields, MiFID II raises the number to 65.


Trade finance giants HSBC is working with IBM to develop a cognitive intelligence solution combining optical character recognition with advanced robotics to make global trade safer and more efficient for thousands of businesses.
HSBC's Global Trade and Receivables Finance (GTRF) team facilitates over $500bn of documentary trade for customers every year, and in doing so must manually review and process up to 100m pages of documents, ranging from invoices to packing lists and insurance certificates.
Newsweek is hosting an AI and Data Science in Capital Markets conference on December 6-7 in New York.  Photo: NewsweekMediaGroup
The new solution uses IBM's analytics technology, including intelligent segmentation and text analytics, to identify, digitise and extract key data within these documents before feeding it into the bank's transaction processing systems; boosting accuracy whilst freeing up staff for more value-adding activities, said a statement.
Natalie Blyth, HSBC's Global Head of GTRF, said: "The average trade transaction requires 65 data fields to be extracted from 15 different documents, with 40 pages to be reviewed. By digitising this process we will make transactions quicker and safer for both buyers and suppliers, leading our industry forwards, and we will reduce compliance risks through an enhanced ability to manage huge volumes of data."
Roger Welch, Industry (Financial) Expert and Solution Architect for IBM Analytics ECM practice, said: "The problem is how to capture semi-structured documents with highly variant content through an analogue process, and no-one has the perfect answer. In our experience, no trade finance solution has come as far or done as much as this new solution."
HSBC is currently using the technology to analyse English-language import and export bills in several markets in Asia, Europe, the Americas and the MENA region. The team aims to enhance the solution so it can read a wider range of documents and languages including Chinese, French and Spanish
"We are continuously investing in technologies that will improve the way we work for the benefit of our customers and our people," added Blyth. "HSBC wants to be the leading bank for innovation, and initiatives like this one are key to achieving our goal."


Eleven banks have passed a major milestone in the digitisation of documentary trade finance. They have developed a prototype application on R3's distributed ledger platform, Corda, that has the potential to significantly reduce inefficiencies and costs by streamlining the processing of sight letters of credit.
Bangkok Bank, BBVA, BNP Paribas, HSBC, ING, Intesa Sanpaolo, Mizuho, RBS, Scotiabank, SEB and U.S. Bank have been collaborating with R3 and technology partner CGI over the last year on numerous trade finance projects, building and testing applications.

Using lessons learnt from these projects, the group has now developed a trade finance application on Corda that incorporates shippers and carriers. Several R3 member institutions intend to pilot the platform with the goal of making it widely available in 2018, said a statement from R3.
David Rutter, CEO of R3, said: "Like so many of the processes and systems banks are forced to use today, the infrastructure that supports trade financing is extremely outdated and prone to risk and error. The work we have been doing with our members over the last year has shown that this challenge no longer needs to stand in the way of giving businesses access to the services they need to trade across borders. The application we have built is the first of its kind and we look forward to rolling it out to our Corda users across the world."
Marguerite Burghardt, Global Head of the Trade Competence Center at BNP Paribas, added: "While LCs have not progressed as much as the open account business in recent years, they remain a good way to finance trade and mitigate risks. If the industry manages to make the whole process fully digital, transparent and STP, this could mean renewed development and wider access to this financing technique."
Vivek Ramachandran, Head of Growth and Innovation, Commercial Banking at HSBC, said: "The prototype integrates a standardised user interface that allows carriers and shipping companies to prepare and validate shipping details when they onboard goods and deliver them to the buyer – even if they are on a different technology platform. We believe that offering optionality in terms of the systems and technologies participants use, and ensuring interoperability between these technologies, will significantly advance efforts to digitise trade.
"To further enhance the prototype, we'll continue to work with established and emerging title registry providers to ensure this solution can provide a secure and legal title transfer of goods in a live environment, and anticipate piloting the app on the R3 network before the end of the year."
R3's distributed ledger platform, Corda, has been built specifically for the financial services industry. The technology offers the ability to simplify the complex links and networks involved in the trade and trade finance market by providing a shared and synchronised database of transactions between businesses across geographies.
Despite the growth of open account business, traditional trade finance remains vitally important, particularly to facilitate international trade. According to the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC), commercial letters of credit still account for 38% of the trade finance product mix. In an effort to meet customer demand and address growing margin pressures, banks have been collaboratively developing a solution to drive greater efficiencies, reduce cost and simplify today's existing processes.
Ivar Wiersma, Head of Innovation Wholesale Banking at ING, said: "This application has the capacity to make the overall trade flow, currently hampered by outdated processes, faster and more cost effective. This is a great step forward in the process of digitalising and standardising the documentary trade finance process from start to finish, connecting multiple parties in the trade finance chain with the feature of interoperability of the different technologies these parties use."
Jim Bidwell, Head of Trade Services Product Management at RBS, said: "Distributed ledger technology has huge potential to improve customer experience and reduce costs across Trade Finance, which has remained largely unchanged for many years. This initiative is a great demonstration of how we can collaborate to develop innovative solutions for our customers."
Craig Weeks, Senior Vice President and Manager of U.S. Bank's International Banking Group, said: "We're excited about the potential of distributed ledger technology to increase transparency and efficiency across the trade finance lifecycle. This work has proven the viability of the technology to effectively manage the process and we're very much looking forward to testing this in an operational setting."


Zurich-based Solidum Partners has completed a private catastrophe bond transaction, $14.8m of notes which it believes is first such securitisation to be settled using a private blockchain.
The transaction was issued using Solidum Partners Guernsey-domiciled transformer vehicle Solidum Re ICC Limited, with one cell named Dom Re IC Limited hosting the underlying reinsurance contract and acting as the issuer for the notes.
Insurance-linked securities (ILS) are essentially financial instruments which are sold to investors whose value is affected by an insured loss event.
Newsweek is hosting an AI and Data Science in Capital Markets conference on December 6-7 in New York.  Photo: NewsweekMediaGroup
Solidum Re is the "ILSBlockchain" permission grantor and blockchain sponsor, said a statement. Using this mechanism the ILSBlockchain has replaced the role of a traditional settlement system such as Euroclear or DTC for this note issue. Dom Re required an alternative to Euroclear as it was becoming increasingly difficult to access efficiently for smaller private placement note issues.
Dom Re IC Limited issued $14,800,000 Principal-at-Risk, Participating Notes, due 2023 with the ISIN GG00BYP34764, an asset-backed securitisation of a reinsurance contract, to a total of six investors. Solidum Re acts as the paying agent and common depository of the permanent global note.
The investors subscribed for the notes, paying into a Guernsey trust where Artex Risk Services (Guernsey) Limited acts as trustee. On the issue date the paying agent created cryptographically-certificated notes on the ILSBlockchain and then the investors were able to execute, peer-to-peer with the paying agent, delivery-vs-payment transactions on the ILSBlockchain to purchase the newly created notes.
Investors now hold their notes, cryptographically confirmed, on the ILSBlockchain. Secondary market traders wishing to purchase notes can do so by becoming participants on the ILSBlockchain and can then execute direct peer-to-peer delivery-vs-payment transactions to buy and/or sell notes seamlessly on the ILSBlockchain. Equally broker-dealers can also become participants on the ILSBlockchain in order to intermediate trades between the other participants, said a statement.
Cedric Edmonds, director of Solidum Re, said: "It was a case of necessity being the mother of invention! Without the excellent support and highly flexible services of the service providers in Guernsey, most notably Artex who picked up the baton at a late stage from another service provider and then ran amazing swiftly with it, completing this would not have been possible – my thanks go out to them."
Mark Helyar, non-executive director of Solidum Re and Of Counsel, Bedell Cristin added: "I am delighted that Solidum Re ICC has concluded this latest transaction. It is not an exaggeration to describe the new Dom Re IC structure as a ground breaking, global first, not only for the ILS sector but for dematerialisation of listed securities generally.
"Guernsey is once again the jurisdiction of choice for innovation in the ILS sector and I anticipate this model will be widely adopted".
Paul Eaton, Business Development Director of Artex, said: ''It has been a great experience to work alongside Cedric and Solidum for this innovative transaction which makes best use of Guernsey's strengths and demonstrates the range of services that Artex is able to offer our clients".


The much anticipated Filecoin token offering has gathered some $52m (£39.9m) of investments from Silicon Valley heavyweights ahead of the start of the sale on Thursday 10 August.
Filecoin, which will be used to power a large decentralised file storage system linked to the iconic IPFS protocol, is unique within the ICO space because it ticks a bunch of regulatory boxes with US regulator the SEC.
Filecoin is also the first ICO to take place on CoinList, the ICO platform developed by Protocol Labs and AngelList to be compliant with the SEC. Filecoin's ICO will demonstrate the use of SAFT (Simple Agreement for Future Tokens) under SEC Reg. D, 506(c).
Newsweek is hosting an AI and Data Science in Capital Markets conference on December 6-7 in New York.  Photo: NewsweekMediaGroup
The whole thing is SEC compliant because only accredited investors can take part in the token sale; this means banks and recognised investment institutions, or high net worth individuals (HNWIs) with $200,000 to invest. It also sidesteps a major point of contention around ICOs, which sell tokens in systems that are yet to be built. Filecoins will not be distributed until after minimum of six months has passed (another box tick according to the SEC's exemption Rule 144), and those who hold off for longer are rewarded.
Juan Benet, founder of IPFS and CEO Protocol Labs, wanted to express his sincere apologies to those who will not qualify as accredited investors and therefore will not be able to take part in the sale.
He said: "It does have one huge side effect, or bad effect, which is that a lot of people that are used to contributing to these sales and have helped fund a lot of things like Ethereum, unfortunately they will not be able to participate. We wish we could include them.
"The accredited investor qualification based on net worth, assets, or income is a rule of thumb that the SEC has had for a long time. This rule is easy to apply across industries and across investor groups, but it definitely cuts too coarsely.
"This completely excludes some of the groups most capable of investing in these kinds of projects, for example, cryptography and game theory PhD students, and it includes lots of people who may have a lot of money but do not know a thing about crypto networks. This is obviously too coarse, and not a very accurate classification of who is capable of doing the due diligence on these projects.
"But at the same time, it's not clear how to improve the system. How else might the SEC get better certainty that investors truly knew what they were doing, understood the risks, and so on? How might they prove people truly were able to make the right call? Would one rather have them administer tests on cryptography, game theory, distributed systems, technology startups, and so on? This could end up worse."
So Filecoin placates the SEC thanks to a standard investor accreditation process, and avoiding the obligatory token pre-sale, raising funding for a network that does not yet exist. If when the network is launched the tokens are not securities themselves, then the restriction does not apply, and the tokens can be sold far and wide, said Benet.
"We think that when there is a token pre-sale, meaning when a group is raising funds before the network launches or before the token becomes usable, then the sale may constitute the sale of securities. For this case, we created the SAFT [Simple Agreement for Future Tokens], an instrument that is a security in the US, and covers the risky 'invest in the creation of the network' part.
"We think this route will be very useful for lots of participants in the industry, both network creators and prospective investors. It helps clear up uncertainties and charts a path toward more compliant token sales. Investors have clarity over the risks of their investment, they have stronger protections – in the form of liquidation, and network creators have clarity over whether or not what they're doing is a sale of securities."
Unsurprisingly, some very astute lawyers are closely following the ICO space. Speaking about the Filcoin ICO, Stephen Palley, a lawyer in the Washington D.C. office of Anderson Kill, said: "Can you comply with securities laws and raise significant amount of money selling tokens? Maybe so.
"The fact Filecoin has pre-sold $52 million to the likes of Sequoia and Union Square Ventures demonstrates the depth of interest in coin-based investments in the VC community.
"If Filecoin is able to successfully raise additional funds with an SEC compliant offering on CoinList that may be something of a turning point in the use of token sales for funding. It suggests that token sales may be something more than a way to raise large sums of money by skirting regulations.
"Another distinguishing factor is that Filecoin is more than 'a whitepaper and a dog' as one twitter wag has described some ICOs. IPFS is an established and (in my view) useful technology and the tokens will provide access to something that has current and existing utility. Time will tell if it's a wise investment or sound technology.
"From a US legal standpoint, they appear to have taken pains to be compliant. Those efforts have so far not impeded their ability to raise a significant amount of money."
Preston Byrne, a technology lawyer with expertise in blockchain/virtual currency/distributed ledger, was less lenient in his judgement.
Byrne said: "On one hand, Filecoin is marketing the early phases of this ICO as an investment opportunity. On the other, the project's private placement memorandum states that once the genesis block is hashed, the resulting coin should 'not be considered a security under U.S. securities laws' and somehow loses its character as an investment.
"ICO projects can't have it both ways. While selling the initial phases of an ICO to accredited investors, as is being done here, is undoubtedly an improvement over the status quo, this does not change the fact that the substance of any ICO investment is the underlying coin and coins are, for better or worse, treated by nearly everyone as investments and not as software licenses.
"When they become available to trade on public marketplaces I would expect UK rules regarding unfair trade practices and financial promotions would apply to their sale."
The dynamics of ICOs are fascinating, but Filecoin itself – like Ethereum – deserves to be classed as a game-changer. Filecoin creates useful proof of work, called proof of replication; the ability to store and share files when they are needed. Once the network is live and these tokens are being put to use to store files in a decentralised manner, this could drive a demand for storage hardware.
Benet said: "This is something that I'm surprised isn't being talked about more right now. I think it's a big story that the storage manufacturers need to hear more about.
"Large companies don't really understand a lot of this stuff yet, but we know there will be massive demand for lots of storage hardware, hard drives, solid state drives and so on. So it will be like the huge demand for Bitcoin mining hardware, but for disks.
"We do expect there will be some big centralised miners that will have a lots of storage and economies of scale. But there will also be a large cloud of small miners all over the world."

The National Settlement Depository (NSD), Russia's central securities depository, and Waves Platform, have started to develop a blockchain platform to support digital assets. The new platform architecture will securely host and store tokenised and crypto assets, settling transactions and providing identification for owners of cryptocurrency wallets.
Development of the platform is already under way and the first prototype will be presented during first half of 2018. Project implementation depends not only on technical development but on the development of a legislative framework that mitigates the risks of crypto asset ownership and ensures that the service is user-friendly.

Eddie Astanin, Chairman of the Executive Board, NSD, commented: "The crypto-asset market is rapidly growing and rightfully attracting enormous attention from traditional institutional investors, post-trade infrastructure and financial regulators around the world.
"In partnering with Waves, our goal is to create a secure and user-friendly accounting infrastructure for digital assets. We consider the platform would not only provide technological and legal protection of all parties involved, but also extend variety of post-trade services for investors, custodians and new institutions emerging in this sector of economy. It is also important to synchronise our efforts with the work of regulators in this field".
Sasha Ivanov, a founder and CEO of Waves Platform, pointed out: "The ability to work with new types of financial instruments will be of interest to a wide circle of market participants, including banks, pension funds and retail investors.
"Collaboration with NSD is important for us with regard to all new and existing instruments, allowing us to ensure a high level of reliability, technological efficiency, and risk protection.

Bank-owned financial messaging provider SWIFT will provide US institutions with a gateway to The Clearing House's real-time payments (RTP) platform. As instant payments become more ubiquitous in the US, SWIFT will provide an interface to manage the requirements of sending and receiving domestic instant payment transactions on behalf of customers, said a statement.
The Clearing House (TCH) is building a new clearing and settlement system to support domestic instant payments in the US, allowing consumers and businesses to send and receive payments in real-time and directly from their accounts at financial institutions. It will also include data and non-payment messages that financial institutions can use to build digital commerce solutions.

SWIFT's solution for the US market will provide banks with the opportunity to leverage a single platform, Alliance Messaging Hub (AMH) for both SWIFT high-value payments and low-value TCH real-time payments.
AMH is an orchestration layer that includes a gateway to the TCH RTP network, as well as other gateways and API's which allow financial institutions to connect to other non-SWIFT networks.
Financial institutions can leverage AMH to support instant payments, simplifying adoption to our customers. The solution will be commercially available by early 2018.
Ignacio Blanco, director, Strategic Relationships at SWIFT, said: "SWIFT is working together with communities worldwide to support the global shift towards real-time payments, and we are pleased to be at the forefront as the US market evolves. The Clearing House is making great strides in accelerating the speed of transactions, and we are committed to playing our part in helping the financial community to operate as efficiently as possible."
Steve Ledford, SVP Product and Strategy at The Clearing House, added: "Given its reach and expertise in payments, SWIFT is a great collaborator as we bring a wide-scale real-time payments system to the US market. Achieving our vision of broad adoption of real-time payments will only be possible when the majority of US institutions are able to participate, and SWIFT will be instrumental in helping us meet this goal."
SWIFT's global instant payments strategy is burgeoning, the US announcement builds on SWIFT's earlier success in Australia and in Europe. In 2015, SWIFT was awarded the contract to deliver the messaging infrastructure to underpin Australia's new payments platform, NPPA, which is expected to go live later in 2017.
Earlier this year, SWIFT announced the launch of an instant payments messaging solution, first for the European market, and elsewhere. It will allow instant payments to be made over the SWIFT network and provide customers with a single gateway to connect seamlessly to multiple instant payments systems.
Amongst others, it will offer connectivity to the Eurosystem's TARGET Instant Payment Settlement (TIPS) and will support the delivery of the future Eurosystem single gateway to TIPS, TARGET2 (T2) and TARGET2 for Securities (T2S) platforms, as laid out in the Eurosystem's Vision 2020.


DENVER -- After two deadly blasts near oil and gas sites in the fast-growing suburbs here, local communities across this political swing state have been considering new rules to regulate fossil fuel development in their midst. But in remarks to oil and gas executives as he leads the Senate GOP's national fundraising effort, Republican U.S. Sen. Cory Gardner — whose seat is considered a top 2020 pickup opportunity for Democrats — slammed the local efforts, asserting that the spate of municipal initiatives are being pushed by well-funded “special interests” from the coasts.
“We know there are big threats on the horizon — we know that there are risks of overregulation, we know that there are risks of special interest groups that are trying to drive ballot initiatives and other regulations at the local level that will drive out common sense economies, and we have to make sure we are all aware of the dangers that that poses to the incredible jobs that we have been able to create,” Gardner told energy executives in Denver. “Ballot initiatives that would ban hydraulic fracturing — we have to make it very clear that that is not in the interest of Colorado. When it comes to policies that are trying to be enacted by interests — well-funded interests — from New York or Los Angeles in local municipalities, that we make it clear that this is what’s happening.”
Gardner — who has received more than  $1.1 million worth of campaign cash from oil and gas donors — portrayed the industry’s fight against local regulations as a David-versus-Goliath battle during his appearance Thursday at the annual conference of the Colorado Oil and Gas Association (COGA). The industry group has helped direct more than  $80 million worth of fossil fuel industry spending on Colorado politics in just the last four years, and it has successfully lobbied to block tougher state regulations of the industry. The group’s event came just as Thornton officials passed a measure to restrict drilling in residential neighborhoods; Ft. Morgan officials imposed a moratorium on injection wells and Erie officials approved a separate ordinance designed to reduce chemical odors that residents say have been wafting over the community from nearby oil and gas rigs.

Those local initiatives are the latest examples of how conflicts over regulating fossil fuel development have become political flashpoints in states across the country. New York and Maryland have banned fracking, while other states such as Texas have passed a law to block local communities from imposing new environmental regulations.
Few states have seen as passionate a debate over the situation as Colorado. With a population influx fueled by its natural beauty and robust job growth in sectors outside the extractive industries, the state has become ground zero in the battle over energy development, as unsuspecting communities suddenly face the prospect of their residential neighborhoods becoming industrial zones.
To ward off local pushback in the past, fossil fuel firms have relied on industry-friendly Colorado officials in both parties.
A few years ago, Colorado's Democratic Gov. John Hickenlooper — a former oil industry geologist — watered down legislation to increase environmental fines and he threatened to sue local communities that attempt to regulate drilling and fracking. More recently, Colorado Republican Attorney General Cynthia Coffman,  whose campaigns have been supported by groups bankrolled by the fossil fuel industry, filed a lawsuit to block such regulations in Boulder, one of the state’s most populous counties.
Those moves came before the deadly blast near an oil well this spring in Firestone and a later blast at an oil tank in Weld County. This week’s COGA conference at the Colorado Convention Center, though, suggested that the fatalities have not radically altered the political dynamic in the state.
For instance, during a discussion about the possibility of future safety or environmental regulations, Colorado Senate Republican leader Chris Holbert told the conference, “I can’t promise to you that nothing bad will happen, but the 18 Senate Republicans are here as your friends,” according to the  Denver Post. The comments came only a few months after Holbert’s Senate Republican caucus helped fossil fuel lobbyists block legislation to set oil and gas rigs further back from schools. After the Firestone explosion, those Senate Republicans also blocked a bill to require energy companies to disclose maps that would tell homeowners if they are living near oil and gas facilities. The Colorado Senate GOP's main fundraising group has received more than $1.1 million from fossil fuel industry donors in recent years.
Meanwhile, on the Democratic side, Hickenlooper this week reversed his earlier support for the mapping initiative while his appointed lieutenant governor, Donna Lynne, expressed gratitude to the assembled oil and gas executives, heaping praise on the industry despite the deadly blasts.  
“Colorado can’t proclaim that we’re a jobs state if we don’t recognize the importance of our business partners, and you clearly here at COGA are partners,” Lynne said. “We believe we have in this state the best health and safety practices in the oil and gas industry, and that kind of engagement and collaboration deserves recognition because it is sometimes not the norm when politics can infect an issue or an event — including when we have tragedies.”
The statement from Lynne, who is considering a 2018 run for governor, highlighted a schism in the Democratic Party that could be an issue in primaries in Colorado, and in other energy-rich states across the country. It was a fissure that was exemplified at the COGA conference by U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet.
During his remarks, the Democratic lawmaker lauded the industry’s innovation and expressed support for lifting the oil export ban and for developing the Keystone XL pipeline, but he implored oil and gas executives to own up to the facts about climate change. He also told reporters that the intensifying fight between local communities and the industry “is a challenge that should not be minimized.”
“You have two very legitimate property interests that are at stake here, the oil and gas industry has a legitimate property interest, and local communities and homeowners have legitimate property interests, and either fortunately or unfortunately, it is in conflict and we have to work our way through that,” Bennet said. “It would be better if people didn’t have to resort to lawsuits to deal with this, and it would be better if we could find a path forward. But I think it’s unreasonable to not expect that this conflict will continue.”
CORRECTION: An earlier version of this report incorrectly said Gardner was up for reelection in 2018. He is up for reelection in 2020, and currently chairs the National Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee. 


Blockchain technology company Blockstream has unveiled a satellite system that will bring Bitcoin connectivity to almost everyone on the planet.
Billions of people all over the world struggle to connect to the internet; in many cases the cost of bandwidth relative to their income makes it prohibitive to do so. In addition to poor infrastructure and poverty, there are also places with lots of political instability, censorship and state control.

Blockstream CEO Dr Adam Back said: "There are lots of places with internet problems, and sometimes whole countries get cut off due to wars or political instability and at those times the only kinds of connectivity that leak out of these countries are satellite communications and sat-phone and things like that.
"And there is also an interesting coincidence between countries with infrastructure challenges and unstable currencies - so there is also a demand for access to global internet money."
Blockstream Satellite allows anyone to operate and maintain Bitcoin nodes across two thirds of the Earth's landmass, with additional coverage areas soon to come online to reach almost every person on the planet by the end of the year.
Adam Back said: "A high level way to look at it is, you've got the global GPS system for navigation; this is a global Bitcoin system so people can use Bitcoin everywhere."
The Blockstream Satellite network currently consists of three geosynchronous satellites that cover four continents - Africa, Europe, South America, and North America. Ground stations called teleports uplink the public Bitcoin blockchain data to the satellites in the network, which then broadcast the data across the globe.
Setup costs are low, less than $100, which can be reduced further by using a recycled satellite dish - a regular TV satellite dish will do. There is no ongoing bandwidth cost once you've got it up and running. Blockstream Satellite brings the costs down by using GNU Radio, an open source software development toolkit which eliminates the need for specialised hardware. Performance is enhanced with Fast Internet Bitcoin Relay Engine (FIBRE).
Chris Cook, head of satellite at Blockstream explained that rather than launching new satellites which is expensive and time consuming, the company is leasing time on existing commercial satellites.
Cook said: "We had a look at the feasibility of launching satellites but were thinking, why launch our own satellite when there are plenty of interesting communication satellites up there that have capacity."
He pointed out that typically satellite equipment costs many thousands of dollars, but that using GNU Radio is major cost saving innovation. This involves a USB connection to the computer, and then it's a programmable radio, like analogue to digital radio processing equipment, which can be used to process all kinds of different signals.
He added: "One of the other cost-saving advantages is that existing TV dishes can be re-used and the system of designs use very small dishes, particularly the ones that are 46 cm or 18 inches in diameter - so they are very common and very unobtrusive."
Dr Back added: "A user or a local business can run a full node, receive all the data and then when they go to send a transaction, they can pay the bandwidth cost for that. A Bitcoin transaction is pretty small, like 250 bytes."
He said bidirectional satellite equipment which can be purchased quite cheaply on eBay could be added. Other communication channels people could use include local Wi-Fi, mesh networks, SMS gateways, dial up, or other kinds of low bandwidth, high distance radio equipment.
For example, a small business on the side of the road with a little petrol generator and a satellite dish on the roof, using a Rasberry Pi to receive the blockchain data and with a Wi-Fi hotspot, can manage to transact globally on the Bitcoin network.
As well as bringing more nodes and more decentralisation to the global Bitcoin network, Blockstream Satellite provides extra redundancy and an additional layer of reliability for blockchain data in the event of a network partition.
Back said from the perspective of miners and Bitcoin businesses generally, "if you're doing high value Bitcoin things or doing mining, you really want to make sure that you're on the Bitcoin network proper. Occasionally there will be internet disruptions where a transatlantic cable is cut or something like that and for a period of even hours you can have network splits. The satellite is a truly redundant link that protects against those kinds of issues for users and businesses."
Using a sail-over connection is also interesting in regard to places where Bitcoin's legal status is unclear, or a government wants to impose capital controls, filter the internet and so on. Back pointed out that the system leaves practically no footprint.
"If a government were looking at the internet connection or if it were going through a government-operated firewall or something, there would be no evidence of participating Bitcoin just coming down from the satellite. And the actual transactions will be very small so they leave a much smaller footprint and be much easier to lose in noise. So it's certainly much more possible to use Bitcoin privately, anonymously, and robustly."
The business of downloading full Bitcoin node software has also been made less onerous in recent times. One of the recent releases introduced pruned modes and there's a no-relay option as well. "If you turn on all the bandwidth saving options and the disk storage options, your footprint is much smaller because it doesn't have to store the historic data, only the current data which will fit in a gigabyte of local storage. So you basically need something like an SD card or something like that, even on a Rasberry Pi," said Back.
Looking ahead, Blockstream intends to add more features and programmability, so that smart phone wallet authors and Bitcoin application developers can also broadcast data by the satellite. Back added: "If it was a particular application that needs to send a message to a recipient that can be broadcast by the satellite too for a small Bitcoin fee."


To fill the position of Secretary of the Army, President Donald Trump first turned to the familiar world of billionaire business leaders and nominated Vincent Viola for the job. But Viola, who made his fortune on Wall Street and owns the National Hockey League’s Florida Panthers, abruptly withdrew his nomination in February, citing difficulties extracting himself from his businesses.
Next, Trump turned to another reliable source of allies — the grassroots of the Republican party — and nominated Tennessee State Senator Mark Green for the position. But Green, a former Army flight surgeon,  withdrew his name from consideration in May, citing “false and misleading attacks” based on controversial statements he made regarding gay and transgender rights.
So for his third try at finding his Army secretary, Trump took a different tack. He headed to the swamp, the one he promised to drain, and found a lobbyist.
Trump nominated Gulf War veteran and West Point graduate  Mark Esper for the Army Secretary post in July, but his confirmation hearings have not yet been scheduled. However, what’s sure to come up in those hearings is the  seven years Esper led the government relations department at Raytheon, where Esper was the top lobbyist at one of the largest defense contractors in the world. This year, Raytheon has already spent millions of dollars lobbying the Department of the Defense, where Esper will work if confirmed by the Senate.

One of Trump’s first actions as president was to institute  ethics rules for his administration that were largely based on rules implemented at the beginning of the Obama administration. But in spite of Trump’s promises to “drain the swamp,” a few critical differences between the two ethics regimes mean that Esper can be Trump’s Army Secretary, but couldn’t have been Obama’s.
Lobbyists taking positions in government, and government employees taking positions at lobbying firms, is nothing new in Washington: It’s so common that movement between the two camps is referred to as the “revolving door.” But under Obama’s ethics rules, lobbyists weren’t able to join an executive agency they lobbied for two years. The Trump administration has no such rule, and the administration is taking advantage of that omission: one watchdog group determined a quarter of ex-lobbyists in the administration lobbied on issues they  worked on in the prior two years.
The de facto rescinding of the two-year rule is why Esper can jump straight from Raytheon (he was listed as a  lobbyist on the company’s most recent lobbying disclosure ) to an agency that Raytheon is lobbying for federal funds and contracts.
If confirmed, Esper will become yet another Trump administration official who is presiding over agencies, departments and offices being lobbied by their former employers, or in the case of ex-lobbyists, former clients.

Many of these officials have signed ethics agreements that forbid them from working on issues that could affect their ex-employers for either a year, or two. Others have been granted waivers for those ethics agreements, waivers which were originally kept secret for months until the White House relented to the increasingly public  protests of the Office of Government Ethics and released  them at the end of May.There are federal statutes on the books that prevent executive-branch staffers from working on any matter that they might have a direct financial interest in. But while officials are expected to recuse themselves from matters directly related to their previous employers, no standardardized recusal process exists across the executive branch, and an individual instance of recusal at the White House doesn’t create a public paper trail.
The White House has evaded specific questions from International Business Times,  as well as other outlets, about who has recused on what issues, instead replying to questions with general statements about the administration's commitment to ethics.
“The White House takes seriously the need for appointees to resign, recuse and divest where required,” Natalie Strom, a White House spokesperson, told IBT in an email. “The White House Counsel's Office worked closely with all White House officials to avoid conflicts arising from their former places of employment or investment holdings. To the furthest extent possible, counsel worked with each staffer to recuse from conflicting conduct rather than being granted waivers, which has led to the limited number of waivers being issued.”
But while the White House Counsel’s office is in charge of the ensuring proper recusals from actual or perceived conflicts of interest, the office itself is not immune from ethical entanglements. Stefan Passantino, the Deputy Counsel to the President and the White House’s “designated agency ethics official” has provided paid legal services to two Trump administration  cabinet members in the last two years: Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson and Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price, according to Passantino’s public financial disclosure.
Passantino also provided services for Icahn Capital, which is led by legendary investor and Trump confidant Carl Icahn. (Passantino recused himself from any matters dealing with Icahn on Jan. 20, according to the New Yorker’s Ryan Lizza.) Until last week, Icahn served as a “special adviser” to the president, a legally ambiguous role that meant the administration's ethics rules didn’t apply to him. It also meant that since he was never serving in an “official role” at the White House, there was no exact date of his departure. But Icahn seemed to have  resigned from the role in advance of a  New Yorker investigation that found Icahn may have tried to use the position to enrich himself.
Former Office of Government Ethics Director Walter Schaub, who now works for the campaign legal center, tweeted that the New Yorker story was “a perfect window into how the White House Counsel is enabling the Administration to dodge ethics.”

Blackstone CEO  Stephen Schwarzman served in a similar non-official adviser role not covered by ethics rules as chairman of the White House’s Strategic and Policy Forum until last week, when the advisory  panels were disbanded amid criticism of Trump’s response to a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville.
In addition to the murky ethical questions surrounding Trump’s unofficial advisers, the White House has decided to not publicly release the White House visitor logs, which makes it difficult to tell which lobbyists and business executives may be meeting with White House staff. (On Tuesday, the Secret Service agreed to  stop erasing White House visitor log data until a lawsuit brought by Public Citizen seeking access to those records can be decided.)
While there are many obstacles that prevent the public from knowing exactly what issues are being worked on, by whom, in the executive branch, and whether ethics rules are being fully enforced, what is publicly available are lobbying records. By examining those records, IBT has compiled a list of executive branch officials who are running, or part of, agencies that are being lobbied by their former employers or clients. There is no indication that the people are on this list have broken any laws, or their ethics agreements, which have required them to recuse themselves.
Instead, the list, which is not comprehensive, shows where a specific kind of ethical entanglement can occur in this administration. It is is simply a survey of Trump’s swamp and a compilation of some of that swamp’s murkiest waters.
White House Deputy Director of Legislative Affairs   Amy Swonger
After serving as a congressional aide to Republican Senators Mitch McConnell and Trent Lott last decade, and working a stint in Vice President Dick Cheney’s office, Amy Swonger traveled through Washington’s busy revolving door to become a lobbyist in 2008. After working at two lobbying firms, Ernst & Young and Invariant LLC (the latter of which was run by Hillary Clinton fundraiser Heather Podesta), Swonger joined the White House in March to  lead the Trump administration’s Senate legislative affairs team. In 2015 and 2016, Swonger had nearly 40 lobbying clients across a diverse set of industries. Records show that in 2017 roughly half of those clients, 18 in total, have lobbied the White House Office or the Executive Office of the President, which contains the White House Office.
According to White House ethics rules, Swonger cannot work on issues related to her former clients for two years. This presents Swonger with a complicated web of conflicts and recusals to navigate, which she has done without the help of an ethics waiver, according to public ethics waiver disclosures. Swonger’s recent clients that have lobbied the White House include NextEra Energy, Dow Chemical, Pfizer, Dish Network, National Association of Real Estate Trusts, Marathon Oil, Marriott International, Johnson & Johnson and the Securities Industry and the Financial Markets Association.
Secretary of State Rex Tillerson

Rex Tillerson spent 31 years at oil giant ExxonMobil before becoming Chairman and CEO of the company in 2006. The former engineer resigned his position on December 31, 2016 to lead the Trump administration’s State Department. As he’s been running the U.S.’s diplomatic corps, and demonstrating himself to be one of the most  media-averse secretaries of state in recent memory, Exxon has been lobbying the State Department.
Exxon lobbying filings from this year that list the State Department as a lobbied organization have a price tag of $3.4 million. Records show that Exxon lobbied on issues that would fall under the purview of the State Department, including “Discussions related to the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)” and “Discussions related to energy infrastructure and investment.”
So far in 2017, Exxon has listed eight registered in-house lobbyists in its filings, and it employs another eleven lobbying firms to fight for its interests in Washington. But that's hardly the extent of the company's influence. The dues it pays to industry trade associations also help pay for the lobbyists those associations hire.  Exxon is a member of the American Petroleum Institute, which also has a  multi-million dollar a year lobbying apparatus. The API didn’t lobby the State Department in 2016, but it has listed the department as one of its lobbied agencies in both of its filings in 2017, the year Tillerson took the helm.
Some of the areas it lobbied include “efforts related to the renegotiation of NAFTA,” and “efforts related to the export of natural gas, petroleum and petroleum products.” Exxon is also a member of the Brazil-U.S. Business Council, which lobbied the State Department on the “promotion of U.S.-Brazil trade and investment relations.”  
Tillerson signed an ethics pledge filed with the Office of Government Ethics that said “for a period of one year after my resignation from ExxonMobil, I will not participate personally and substantially in any particular matter involving specific parties in which I know ExxonMobil is a party or represents a party, unless I am first authorized to participate."
Secretary of Transportation Elaine Chao

Secretary of Transportation Elaine Chao, who was labor secretary in the George W. Bush administration, served on the board of Alabama-based Vulcan Materials from February 2015 until she resigned the position to serve in the Trump administration.
Vulcan calls itself the “nation’s largest producer of construction aggregates,” which means it is a huge supplier of gravel, sand, and crushed stone — products that are needed in vast quantities to build highways and other infrastructure projects. Since the government has a central role in these kind of projects, Vulcan often lobbies the Department of Transportation. In the first two quarters of 2017, Vulcan has hired four lobbying firms and one of them, Ice Miller Strategies, has lobbied the Transportation Department on just one issue: the reauthorization of the Federal Highway Administration, which  manages federal funding of  maintenance and construction of highways.
Chao’s  ethics agreement states only that she will “not participate personally and substantially” in any matter that has a “direct and predictable effect” on Vulcan until her deferred stock is redeemed. There is no mention of a year-long, or two year-long, recusal from matters related to Vulcan in Chao’s ethics agreement. Chao is also the wife of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. 
Secretary of Defense James Mattis

Defense Secretary James Mattis was the first member of Trump’s cabinet confirmed by the Senate, which voted 98-1 to confirm the retired Marine general and former U.S. Central Command leader. Mattis left the Marines in 2013, and soon joined the boards of several organizations and companies, including  scandal-plagued biotech startup Theranos and General Dynamics, one of the nation’s largest defense contractors and the receipient of $14.5 billion worth of federal contracts in 2016,  according to the General Services Administration.
General Dynamics, like most large military contractors, spends millions of dollars a year on lobbying the Defense Department to secure contracts and steer business its way. Of the $7.2 million dollars on lobbying General Dynamics has spent this year, filings representing $6.2 million of that total list the Defense Department as one of the lobbied entities. The company lobbies on a variety of topics, but a survey of company lobbying filings show the company is mainly lobbying on appropriations. One filing identifies lobbying issues as “Department of Defense issues and funding (research & development and procurement) related to: shipbuilding; submarines; ground vehicles; aircraft; communications systems; defense intelligence programs; ammunition and weapon systems; military information support operations.”
In his ethics agreement letter, Mattis said he would not participate in any matter involving General Dynamics for a year. He also said he would divest all of his General Dynamics stock and vested stock options.
Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross

Billionaire investor and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross’s efforts to disentangle himself from his financial conflicts was trickier than most Trump administration appointees due to the sheer size of Ross’s personal holdings. His  financial disclosure form filed in December listed current positions with more than 50 organizations and companies. One of those companies, a Luxembourg-based steel and mining firm called ArcelorMittal, has been lobbying the Commerce Department this year. Ross became a director at ArcelorMittal in 2008, and in 2017 the company’s U.S. division has spent more than a million dollars on lobbying.
The ArcelorMittal lobbying filings that list the Commerce Department as a lobbied entity indicate the company was lobbying on international trade matters, including “Chinese government policies promoting steel overcapacity and unfair trading practices,” “strong enforcement of U.S. trade laws,” and issues related to “currency manipulation,” “global steel overcapacity” and NAFTA. Ross signed an  ethics agreement that said he would not involve himself in matters involving ArcelorMittal, and a number of other companies he held positions in, for a year after his resignation from those companies.
National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn

Gary Cohn jumped straight from his job as the president of Goldman Sachs to become Trump’s top economic advisor and director of the White House’s National Economic Council (NEC). In doing so, he got a $285 million payout from the investment bank that included favorable terms on stock options that raised concerns among ethics experts.
Last week,  IBT reported that Cohn’s NEC had been lobbied by at least three trade associations and industry groups that count Goldman Sachs as a member. They included the Investment Company Institute, the Managed Funds Association, and the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association. Together, the three groups spent $3.6 million on government lobbying in the first two quarters of 2017.
Deputy Interior Secretary David Bernhardt

David Bernhardt was a lobbyist for lobbying firm Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck in the late nineties before joining the Department of the Interior during the Bush administration. He then returned to Brownstein as a partner and eventually launched the firm’s  Energy, Environment and Resource Strategies Division. Earlier this year, Bernhardt took one more trip through the revolving door, returning to government to become the number two official at Trump’s Interior Department, which oversees the National Parks Service, as well as all federally-owned land. His ties to oil and gas industry clients led a Democratic Congressman to call him a “walking conflict of interest.”
Two of Bernhardt’s immediate former clients have lobbied the Interior Department through Brownstein in 2017, including California’s  Westlands Water District, which sued the Interior Department four times while a Bernhardt client, and the  Navajo Nation.
While not clients of Bernhardt specifically, other clients of Bernhardt’s firm, where he was a partner, have also lobbied the Interior Department this year. These include mining and oil and gas interests like Gemfield Resources, Statoil, WPX Energy, and Taylor Energy Company, among others.  
One client that did hire Brownstein to lobby the Interior Department  this year is the Governor’s Office of the State of Colorado, which has never hired a federal lobbying firm before this year, according to federal filings. Those filings indicate that Gov. John Hickenlooper, a Democrat, spent a total of $70,000 of taxpayer money to hire Brownstein to lobby the Justice Department, the Interior Department, the EPA and Congress on “issues related to federal funding for national service programs” and fiscal year 2017 and 2018 appropriations. Hickenlooper also hired Brownstein to lobby Congress on “issues related to healthcare.”
Hickenlooper’s office said the decision to hire Brownstein had nothing to do with Bernhardt, who is a Colorado native.
“Our office hired a lobbying firm after the new administration came in, anticipating that we would need to build key relationships with the new administration. We recognized we would be navigating possible changes in the federal approach to issues of importance to states including energy policy, health care, marijuana and the environment to name a few. We wanted to ensure Colorado had a voice as these issues were discussed,” Hickenlooper’s press secretary Jacque Montgomery told IBT in an email.   
“Our decision had nothing to do with Mr. Bernhardt, who left for the Department of Interior after we hired BHFS. We think it's important to work with a firm that has ties to Colorado.  BHFS is the only lobbyist with headquarters in Denver,” Montgomery said.
In his  ethics agreement, Bernhardt said he would refrain from involving himself in matters dealing with his former firm, and former clients, for one year.
Special Assistant to the President for Domestic Energy and Environmental Policy Mike Catanzaro

As a registered lobbyist for lobbying firm CGCN in 2015 and 2016, the former Congressional and White House staffer and EPA Associate Deputy Administrator Michael Catanzaro represented a variety of oil and gas, mining and energy clients. Earlier this year, he joined the NEC as the Special Assistant to the President for Domestic Energy and Environmental Policy. As several of his former CGCN clients have lobbied the NEC in 2017, including Boeing, Koch Companies, Microsoft, General Motors, Financial Services Roundtable, Investment Company Institute and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the White House granted Catanzaro  an ethics waiver that allowed him to break his ethics agreement in order to “participate in broad policy matters and particular matters of general applicability relating to the Clean Power Plan, the WOTUS rule,” also known as the EPA’s clean water rule, and “methane regulation.”
Department of Homeland Security Deputy Chief of Staff Chad Wolf
Former Wexler Walker lobbyist and Bush-administration TSA official Chad Wolf lobbied Congress on behalf of Analogic Corporation in 2015 and 2016 and pushed the company’s  airport security technology. In December of 2016, Analogic announced that its new ConnectCT screening system would  undergo TSA testing (that  testing is still ongoing ). A few months later, Wolf became the chief of staff at the TSA. Then, In July, Wolf was promoted to Acting Deputy Chief of Staff at the Department of Homeland Security, the TSA’s parent agency.
Two of Wolf’s former clients have lobbied the Homeland Security Department in 2017. One is robotics and automation technology company ABB, which lobbied the agency on “Energy Efficiency,” and “Grid Security & Resilience,” according to  federal records. The other is the National Association of Software and Services Companies (NASSCOM),  which lobbied DHS on “high skill immigration,” “green cards,” and “visa processing.”


Back in September 2006, the U.S. experienced what became known as the "spinach crisis." Following the discovery of an outbreak of E.coli linked to uncooked spinach, it took over two weeks to trace the tainted product to a single 50-acre farm in California, by which time every bag of spinach in the US had been pulled from the shelves. There were three deaths, hundreds taken ill, and it took many years for the U.S. spinach industry to recover.
There is no clear and transparent way for bad products to be surgically removed from the ecosystem of retailers and suppliers (a recent salmonella outbreak linked to papayas was first detected on 17 May and not traced until 26 July).

IBM has a blockchain solution to deal with food safety and traceability, and it has teamed up with major food brands like Walmart, Dole, Golden State Foods, Kroger, McCormick and Company, Nestlé, Tyson Foods, Driscoll's, McLane Company and Unilever to build it out.
Blockchains create an end-to-end, tamper-proof ontology when it comes to checking and recording stuff. It could be argued that IBM's blockchain work with supply chains, trade finance, and provenance tracking is world leading. In addition, it's a use case that's well-suited to Hyperledger Fabric's general purpose blockchain and its privacy channels architecture.
IBM and Walmart started working on blockchain pilots last year: one in China with pork, and one in the US with mangoes. When the technology was demonstrated at a Walmart shareholders meeting, the process of tracing a pack of sliced mangoes, which had taken Walmart just shy of a week, was done in two seconds using a blockchain.
Brigid McDermott, vice president of Blockchain Business Development, IBM Research, said: "In addition to having the full view of where the consignment of mangoes came from, we also got visibility of where it was in between. What if the contamination wasn't from the farm; what if it was the processing plant; what if it was the distribution center?
"You have all of these details, end to end, farm to retailer, or farm to fork. So now you can quickly and surgically take problem items out of the food system, protecting the health of the global population, as well as being a much better financial approach for the companies involved."
The Walmart proof of concept [PoC] involved just the one mango supplier and the one pork supplier; now IBM is building out beyond linear PoCs into the food supply ecosystem, said McDermott. But she also pointed out that it's not just about going after Fortune 100 suppliers and retailers. "You also have to be able to have the one-acre farmers join the system. You have to get the regulators join the system, the logistics companies and so on."
The aim is for the blockchain to hold an immutable record of where something comes from, what time it arrives, what time it leaves, what temperature it is and more. "Because we are talking permissioned blockchain, Dole can say it wants information about a transaction with Walmart to go to Walmart, but doesn't want Kroger to see that," she said.
"This is about taking the datasets that you have, whether they are in SAP or in EDI, and using standards like the GS1 standard, taking this information and putting it onto the blockchain so that you can share with comfort with confidence because you have that trust."
Transparency and traceability are interesting facets of blockchain-style databases. Transparency could also allow retailers and the brands they stock to show consumers at the end of the chain that products are sustainably sourced and free of additives etc. This kind of Fair Trade blockchain model is already being explored by start-ups like Provenance in the UK, which is working with the Co-op. One possible direction would be evolving towards an open model, an easy-to-use QR code and interface and publicly verifiable blockchain.
McDermott said: "Our view is that this system should be as open as possible for folks to engage in. But because the data is sensitive, if you send information you want to know for sure who you are talking to.
"But you bring up an interesting point, which is governance. The IBM Blockchain Platform is about how do you develop, govern and operate a blockchain network. So we are providing the tools that allow folks to do that."
The IBM Blockchain has a governance policy set up by the founder or founders of the network. The system uses a voting process that collects signatures from members in order to govern the invitation of new members, the distribution of smart contracts and creation of transactions channels. McDermott said that in the case of the permissioned food safety blockchain, the exact rules for enrolment have not yet been figured out.
"That's why this collaboration with these influencers and innovators in the market is so important. It's not about IBM coming out and saying this is the right way to do this; it's about understanding from the participants and the ecosystem itself," she said.
The IBM Blockchain Platform is based on Hyperledger v1.0 and includes tools like Hyperledger Composer and "IBM Developer Journeys" for blockchain, featuring free open-source code, documentation, APIs, architecture diagrams and one-click deployment Git repositories to fast-track building – all designed to get IBM customers up and running in minutes.
As previously alluded to, the IBM blockchain approach explores democratic governance tools using votes cast via signatures of existing participants on the chain. The whole thing runs off the IBM Cloud protected by the various battle-tested security that comes with it. IBM Blockchain Platform starts at $0.50 per hour for enterprise clients. To support blockchain ecosystems among different organisations, the cost of the network can be shared across all network members, said an IBM statement.
Asked approximately how much she expects the blockchain offering to generate in the coming year, McDermott said "a lot we hope."
In addition, IBM is also helping to expand the blockchain ecosystem across academia to meet the demand for skills in this area. Resources on offer include software, training and professional partnerships free of charge to more than 1,000 universities in the IBM Academic Initiative. There is also six months of access to the IBM Cloud for use of the blockchain sandbox to help students hone development skills.
IBM is also working with select universities including Fordham, University of Arkansas and University of British Columbia to fund research grants, develop customised curricula and host workshops and hackathons.


Former CIA agent Valerie Plame Wilson — an outspoken critic of President Donald Trump on social media —  joined a chorus of voices online who are petitioning the president have his Twitter account removed from the platform. But Wilson has taken her campaign a step further by crowd-funding for enough of a stake in the company to get him kicked off Twitter herself.
Wilson — on behalf of anti-nuclear weapons group  Global Zero — started a GoFundMe campaign last week that hopes to raise a $1 billion dollars to buy stake in the social media company. Wilson wrote on the  campaign page that she hoped to raise enough money to purchase a controlling share of the social media company, which she said might afford her enough power to have the president removed from the platform.
“Donald Trump has done a lot of horrible things on Twitter,” the campaign reads. “From emboldening white supremacists to promoting violence against journalists, his tweets damage the country and put people in harm's way. But threatening actual nuclear war with North Korea takes it to a dangerous new level.”
The campaign added, “Twitter is a publicly traded company. Shares = power. This GoFundMe will fund the purchase of a controlling interest in Twitter. At the current market rate that would require over a billion dollars — but that's a small price to pay to take away Trump's most powerful megaphone and prevent a horrific nuclear war.”

The company had raised nearly $50,000 of its $1 billion goal as of Thursday afternoon after a week of campaigning. However, the  Associated Press reported that as of Wednesday, a majority stake in the company would cost approximately $6 billion. While $1 billion would make her the company’s largest shareholder, the AP also noted that Wilson would “fall far short of gaining a controlling interest” in Twitter.
In the event that the campaign doesn’t raise enough money to buy a “significant stake” in Twitter, the campaign noted, proceeds raised would be donated to Global Zero.
White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders responded to the campaign in a statement that called the campaign “ridiculous.”
“Her ridiculous attempt to shut down [Trump’s] first amendment is the only clear violation and expression of hate and intolerance in this equation,” the statement said.
Wilson tweeted an apparent response to the claim on Twitter Wednesday.
“Lots of trolls yelling & screaming that #BuyTwitter #BanTrump campaign ‘suppresses free speech.’ They're wrong. Here's why: Free speech has limits,” she wrote. “Can't yell ‘FIRE!’ in a crowded theater to cause a stampede. Can't incite violence.”
She added, “1st Amendment only stops gov't interference w/ your speech. @Twitter isn't the gov't & this isn't a public square.”
Wilson resigned from the CIA in 2005 after working as an undercover operative until 2003. Her identity was leaked by associates of former President George W. Bush’s administration that year in apparent retribution for criticisms of the Bush administration made by her husband, Joseph Wilson.


Most data turns out to have a greater value than the sum of the parts. There's a story about a global courier firm that said it saw a large drop off in its monthly orders at some point in 2007, not too long before the bottom fell out of the global economy. Traditional economic forecasting did not see an issue, but had there been some visibility into trade finance data at that time it would have shown many contracts had been cancelled, affording us some warning of what was ahead.
Macro-economic forecasters and statistical analysts know that trade data provides the most precise window into the global economy there is. Trade finance data has always been a notoriously opaque part in the supply chain, but we are now seeing end-to-end digitisation, as a multitude of banks and software providers test out trade/supply blockchains and other digital platforms.
Supply chains have traditionally transacted using antiquated processes and physical letters of credit, bills of lading and purchase orders. This is now being rapidly digitalised, making it easy to aggregate and also access.

Christian Lanng, CEO Tradeshift (a trade finance and supply chain solution working with HSBC and Santander), said: "Over the next two to five years we are going to see massive digitalisation of that global trade dataset. It's moving from offline to online. It also means you can trade on it in a whole different way, leverage it in different ways. You can use it for research and in other contexts."
Tradeshift supports over 100 different transacting types, like bills of lading, letters of credit, invoices, purchase orders and more. Lanng said one of the main reasons you are seeing lots of data aggregation is because of cloud computing, which has driven down the cost of the procedure. "All this is built on open powerful platforms. We have open APIs. We can build third party applications that can leverage this data."
Today there's whole industry that revolves around alternative data that can be cleaned and readied for use by alpha-hungry asset managers and hedge funds. But while a company like Visa has one of the most valuable datasets on the planet, it would never reveal transaction data about its customers. The same could be said about Maersk, which has at its fingertips a snapshot of more than half the world's supply chains.
So while the platforming of supply chains and the use of shared ledgers will undoubtedly make this data more immediate and more granular – the question is will it ultimately become more accessible?
Tony Nash, CEO at data analytics firm Complete Intelligence, says trade datasets are a very good proxy of global supply/demand, but trade finance remains a missing piece.
"Trade lets us know exactly what's happening on supply chains, you know exactly what's happening with finished goods. The problem with trade finance today is that there is huge amount of opacity. Individual banks and trade finance firms aren't really that willing to surrender their trade finance data, so anything around trade finance that's public is really estimated.
"I think blockchain will bring some transparency to trade finance and actual aggregate values, and will do it in a much more real time sense. A lot of this information is so far delayed that you don't really know what's going on."
"There isn't a global source for this stuff. We've got goods data; we've got some services data, and all this currency commodity macro data. Trade finance adds a very interesting layer in terms of the timing of impacts and how they impact the cyclical nature of trade."
Those who follow the enterprise blockchain space know that data privacy is sine qua non – as much between participant banks running nodes as anyone else. Professional data collection and curation players are well aware of this fact. But they see the potential and are watching the space closely.
Tammer Kamel, CEO of Quandl, a well-known provider of data insights to the asset management industry, said: "Almost all our hedge fund customers covet supply chain insights. While Quandl has some data now that illuminates part of the picture, gaps remain. Blockchain adoption could well be what throws more light on things.
"That said, most supply chain participants have strong incentives to keep the details of their business operations confidential. In this space, as in others, we are watching blockchain adoptions closely to see what powerful data will emerge as the by-product."
Blockchain technology is very much in the offing and there are likely to be many variations in design as different use cases are fully explored. Amber Baldet, blockchain programme lead at JP Morgan, has overseen the creation of an extremely security-conscious modification of the Ethereum public blockchain called Quorum, which is aimed at enterprise uses. However, she said some blockchain uses – and she used global trade as an example – will likely see lots of value in the future by being spread across very large networks of users.
"Everybody is looking at supply chain on blockchain. If you only want to internalise receivables flows or letters of credit – markets between a relatively small number of banks – then you are fine using an enterprise blockchain solution purpose built for a small group of semi-trusted parties," said Baldet.
"But if you think that over time you want to add thousands or millions of end point suppliers to this thing; not only corporates, but perhaps actual vendors making fabrics and very little shops ... any sufficiently adopted sort of permissioned chain starts to look a lot more like a public chain."
This type of blockchain, while not open to the entire world, might become so adopted that we will gradually see security/utility trade-offs. At some point this seems to bleed into the old internet/intranet argument often invoked by opponents of private blockchains.
Jeremy Epstein, CEO of Never Stop Marketing has spent some time thinking about the intersection of big data and blockchains and how this might play out. He sees this phase of blockchain construction as similar to the big excitement in the late 90s around corporate intranets. "Over time, there will be a realisation that the real value is in permissionless, or the internet version of the blockchain. I think what you'll start to see is new supply chains that are being built around these sort of public blockchains," said Epstein.
He pointed out that companies like Google and Facebook lead the way in artificial intelligence and machine learning at the moment partly because they have access to the most data. But that might change with a more open, decentralised internet.
"In the short term, big companies with massive amounts of data are going to have an advantage. But I think eventually we will see the value of the public blockchain; the ease of innovation on top of it, that's the real differentiator.
"Collaboration is going to happen as more and more of these small players start jumping on, creating nodes and micro-niche apps. It could be a Kenyan coffee supply chain node on this global coffee supply chain.
"Big companies can't innovate at the micro level because it's not valuable or profitable for them. But some entrepreneur in Nairobi can. And all of a sudden the data on public blockchains starts exploding. So if I'm going to analyse what's happening in the global coffee market, I can look at this public blockchain; I can put my AI and machine learning algorithms on top of it," he said.
"The more data wins, and eventually there's going to be more data in the public blockchains. No private organisation or even private ecosystem is going to be able to compete with billions of people."


 SeaWorld San Diego officials confirmed Thursday that a pygmy sperm whale under the company's veterinarian care died, according to NBC-affiliated station KNSD. The female calf, which was only a couple months old, died Wednesday. 
The pygmy sperm whale was discovered in July by bystanders at La Jolla Shores in San Diego. Passersby recorded video of the beached whale, but they also alerted lifeguards and local animal rescue organizations of the incident. Bystanders waited with the calf until animal care specialists from SeaWorld San Diego arrived at the scene. The death was reportedly sudden because the animal began to show signs of improvement.
Jody Westberg, head of the SeaWorld's animal rescue program, issued a statement about her team's thoughts on the whale's death.
"We're just heartbroken about the loss of this little calf," Westberg said, according to the Times of San Diego.
"Her passing was very emotional for all of us," Westberg added. "We gave her everything we had and truly hoped she would have survived. Our rescue team poured their hearts into trying to give her a second chance at life."
David Koontz, the park's communications director, issued a statement to International Business Times Thursday about the whale's death. 
"It saddens me to report that the stranded pygmy sperm whale calf rescued by SeaWorld San Diego on La Jolla Shores Beach on July 28 passed away suddenly last night at approximately 11 p.m.," Koontz told IBT. "The calf had remained in critical and guarded condition since her rescue, but had been showing steady signs of improvement, even gaining 8 pounds, over the last 27 days."
Koontz added, "While SeaWorld’s rescue team and veterinarians understood that the odds of the calf’s long-term survival were not favorable, they did everything they could for her including providing around-the-clock care over the past month."
The female calf beached itself July 28 when it was only three weeks old. SeaWorld San Diego's veterinarians and animal care specialists reportedly provided rehabilitative services to care for the pygmy sperm whale. However, the park's staff weren't certain if the whale would survive. 
"This is an extremely critical period for the calf and it is too early to determine her long-term prognosis," Koontz said in July, according to SD News. "In consultation with National Marine Fisheries Service, SeaWorld’s animal care staff continues to evaluate the young whale’s overall health. "The calf is also being fed a cetacean baby milk formula every three to four hours."
Jim Milburry, a public relations officer for National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Fisheries, issued a statement to IBT Thursday about the likelihood of the whale's survival.
"While uncommon off the West Coast, strandings of this species, and the closely related dwarf sperm whale, frequently occur in the Southeastern United States," the NOAA told IBT. "Historic attempts to rehabilitate these species have had little success, with only a single animal ever having been successfully released. As a young calf, this animal had many challenges to overcome, and ultimately succumbed despite the best efforts by SeaWorld."
SeaWorld's Animal Rescue program has helped to save the lives of more than 30,000 animals. The company's rescue program has spanned 50 years, which includes rescue services available 24 hours daily.  
"The SeaWorld Rescue Team is on call 24/7/365 to care for ill, injured and orphaned animals, often in need of lifesaving care," SeaWorld San Diego's website reads. "For more than five decades, this dedicated team has provided a second chance at life to more than 30,000 animals, always with the goal of rehabilitating them and returning them to the wild."
SeaWorld's Rescue Team has gone to great lengths to rescue animals in the past because the company recognizes that "no two cases are ever the same," according to its website. Care experts have created nutritional formulas to hand-feed animals and fixed turtles' cracked shells with everyday items, among other specialized services. 
Not all care efforts at SeaWorld are successful. A killer whale at the San Diego park reportedly died August 15 from either a respiratory bacterial infection or lung disease, according to a statement from SeaWorld. Veterinarians were forced to euthanize the whale, Kasatka, after suffering for several years. Kasatka was diagnosed with a lung condition in 2008.

Listed blockchain boutique Coinsilium Group is launching Terrastream in Gibraltar, to build out a blockchain-powered platform that operates in the off-shore haven's proposed distributed ledger technology regulatory framework.
The Terrastream platform will offer tokenised applications in several industry sectors, including, but not limited to, the precious metals and natural resources extractive industries, said a statement.
Coinsilium has held meetings with senior representatives from Gibraltar Financial Services Commission (GFSC), and expects to find the support of a conducive regulatory framework within the jurisdiction. Apparently, Gibraltar is expected to become the first jurisdiction globally to develop a regulatory framework for blockchains.
Newsweek is hosting an AI and Data Science in Capital Markets conference on December 6-7 in New York.  Photo: NewsweekMediaGroup
In May 2017, Gibraltar Finance released a consultation document as part of its process towards establishing this regulatory framework. The operative date is expected to be no later than 1 January 2018. Coinsilium has appointed specialist Law Firm ISOLAS to advise on the structuring of Terrastream and its funding efforts.
Malcolm Palle, executive chairman of Coinsilium, said: "Gibraltar has an impressive track record of successfully identifying opportunities in early trends and has built a solid reputation in the gaming and fintech industries.
"Coinsilium's subsidiary Terrastream will be one of the first blockchain-focused companies to support Gibraltar's regulatory initiative and we expect the DLT Regulatory Framework to provide investors and industry participants alike with the confidence and certainty to embrace and support the development of many exciting blockchain ventures in the future. We look forward to updating investors on further developments with Terrastream at this exciting time for Coinsilium."


Enterprise Ethereum Alliance stalwart DFINITY is coming out the bushes with its "infinite blockchain cloud computer", slated for release later in the autumn.
The DFINITY decentralised cloud computer is similar in concept to Ethereum, but combines the deterministic properties of blockchains and digital signatures with random number generating algorithms to propagate a "blockchain nervous system" that can power everything from proof of stake systems to decentralised Uber.
DFINITY Stiftung is  the not-for-profit organisation dedicated to the research and development of "DFINITY" blockchain technologies, which is based in Zug, Switzerland. DFINITY will launch a multi-thousand node demonstration network in Fall 2017 that showcases some of its new technology in action.
Newsweek is hosting an AI and Data Science in Capital Markets conference on December 6-7 in New York.  Photo: NewsweekMediaGroup
DFINITY will unleash the power of supply chain transactions, Internet of Things, financial markets and exchanges, charities, and intellectual property management, to name a few, on an unbounded, open and secure platform, said a statement.
One aim of the new network is to slash enterprise IT costs by reducing the human capital involved in supporting the development, maintenance and administration of traditional enterprise IT systems, it said. These enterprise systems, being collated on the same super massive virtual computer, will also be able to interoperate and incorporate the functionality provided by other services with ease. DFINITY will also enable the development of a new kind of "open source business" involving autonomous software that is updated via inbuilt governance systems and fulfill roles today performed by the likes of eBay or Uber.
DFINITY president and chief scientist Dominic Williams said: "The quality of our rapidly expanding team is unparalleled within the industry and composed of real superstars. We are building a NASA for decentralization with research centers in Silicon Valley and Switzerland that will rapidly advance the new Internet 3.0 paradigm."
He said the DFINITY network incorporates an algorithmic governance system that allows it to be fully adaptive with respect to economics, upgrades and other requirements, and manage the open environment it creates to ensure it is hospitable for corporate and mainstream applications.
The team behind the project, which dates back to 2014, includes notable cryptography  scientists and engineers such as Timo Hanke (AsicBoost) and Ben Lynn (the "L" from the "BLS" cryptography applied by "Threshold Relay").


A Virginia woman claimed this week that she was denied access to medical supplies she needed for her 18-month-old special needs son by United Airlines staff following a delay on a Norfolk-bound flight.
Shelby Davis, 24, said that airline officials during the delay denied her requests for access to her checked baggage, which contained needed formula for her son. After repeated requests, she was reportedly told she could retrieve her luggage from baggage claim but would not be allowed to reboard, which stranded the family in Chicago as they awaited another flight.
The Virginia Beach mother said that her infant son, Easton, suffered from chromosomal conditions that delayed his development and caused him breathing issues, the  Virginian-Pilot reported Wednesday. After spending the weekend visiting Davis’ boyfriend, the two were on their way home from O'Hare International Airport Monday evening when their flight was delayed due to a mechanical issue.
“United Flight 1735 from Chicago O’Hare to Norfolk required a new aircraft following a mechanical issue with the initial aircraft,” the airline told International Business Times in a statement. “During the delay, a customer requested that we retrieve her checked baggage as it contained supplies for her son. Due to the aircraft change, our customer had to retrieve her checked bag at baggage claim, which prevented her from flying to Norfolk.”
The airline said it put Davis on “the next flight to Norfolk” and issued her a refund. It did not provide any additional details about the incident or how it was being handled internally.

As it was the first time Davis had traveled with her son, she said she brought enough formula and the necessary equipment to hold them over until Norfolk. But Davis left an extension for the feeding tube as well as extra formula in the family’s checked luggage, and the flight delay meant she would need more formula for her son. She said he had become “pretty fussy” and was “chewing on his fingers and crying and sweating” because he was getting hungry.
Davis claimed that despite her requests that United Airlines staff allow her access to her baggage, the airline refused. Gate staff reportedly told her the request defied the carrier’s safety policies. When a supervisor got involved, Davis was told that she could go get her luggage herself but that she would not be able to reboard the flight.
Davis opted to retrieve her luggage before later spending the night with her boyfriend to await a new flight. According to the Virginian-Pilot, Davis arrived Tuesday evening and missed a day of work worth $100 in wages. She also claimed she was hung up on several times the following day because representatives for the airline didn’t like her “tone.” Davis said that she’ll opt to drive over flying next trip.
Remarkably, Monday’s incident involving Davis and her son was not the first time the airline failed to accommodate a special needs child. A family whose daughter suffered from Spastic Quadriplegic Cerebral Palsy  claimed in January that the girl — who could not sit up on her own and was extremely small her for age of 2 — was forced to be strapped in across her family’s laps lying down after a single flight attendant failed to make an exception for the girl, as per United Airlines policy if a passenger cannot sit up on his or her own.
United Airlines has faced no shortage of public relations headaches as of recent, with its most public incident this year being one in April when Dr. David Dao was bloodied and dragged off of an overbooked flight after refusing to forfeit his seat.

An airline flight was diverted Tuesday after hitting bad turbulence, according to CBS affiliate KMOV. The turbulence resulted in the injuries of three people on board. 
SkyWest Airlines Flight 3167 was in route from Atlanta to Chicago before it met a wave of turbulence. The airline took precautionary action and landed the plane at St. Louis Lambert International Airport (STL) in St. Louis, Missouri. Flight 3167 was operating under American Eagle  — an American-based airline that allows several airlines to fly under its brand.
A SkyWest flight attendant and two passengers sustained injuries from the turbulence. However, no further incidents occurred upon landing. Paramedics met Flight 3167 at the tarmac to transport the three injured people to the local hospital. 
A representative from SkyWest Airlines issued a statement to International Business Times Tuesday about the emergency landing in St. Louis.
"SkyWest Flight 3167, operating as American Eagle from Atlanta to Chicago, diverted to St. Louis after it briefly encountered unexpected severe turbulence," SkyWest told IBT. "The flight landed without incident in St. Louis, where paramedics met the aircraft."
SkyWest added, "A flight attendant and two customers were transported to a nearby hospital for evaluation. The safety of all onboard our aircraft is our primary concern. Both American Airlines and SkyWest are taking care of our passengers and crew at this time."
A representative from American Airlines did not immediately return IBT's request for comment. 
SkyWest Airlines isn't the first to suffer from turbulence issues in-flight. American Airlines hit a wave of extreme turbulence early August, according to USA Today. The severe turbulence that plagued Flight 759 caused injury to at least 10 people. United Airlines also faced severe turbulence in July, according to Business Insider. Turbulence on United Flight 1031 caused injury to nine passengers and one crew member. 
How dangerous is turbulence? Turbulence is listed as the most common form of in-flight injury, according to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). Turbulence causes injury to approximately 58 people annually, but a bumpy ride shouldn't create cause for concern among passengers and airline crew members. 
"Flying is the safest way to travel. Passengers can easily prevent injuries from unexpected turbulence by keeping their seat belt buckled at all times," the FAA wrote in a press release.
Airline pilots determine methods to reduce turbulence ahead of their flights. According to The Washington Post, pilots utilize multiple sources to help plan for possible turbulence.  
"They receive weather forecasts and reports before liftoff and real-time intel from other pilots and air traffic controllers mid-flight," the publication reported August 9. "Using this data, they can determine which patches of sky and altitudes to avoid. In addition, new aircraft can automatically sense the turbulence at the moment of impact and report the details back to the ground."
Weather is constantly changing, which can sometimes make early predictions irrelevant. Therefore, unpredicted turbulence has the ability to occur. According to a blog post from airline pilot Patrick Smith, turbulence levels are graded on a scale from "light" to "extreme."
"When we pass on reports to other crews, turbulence is graded from "light" to "extreme,'" Smith wrote on his website, Ask The Pilot. "The worst encounters entail a post-flight inspection by maintenance staff. There are definitions for each degree, but in practice, the grades are awarded subjectively."

Crowdsourced investment manager Quantopian has two foundational principles: first, that there is quantitative talent all over the world, and second, that quantitative managers need to continually find new strategies.
Jonathan Larkin, Chief Investment Officer, Quantopian said: "Quantitative and technically capable people aren't only found in financial centres where traditional hedge funds have hired and employed people."
"Quantitative trading is a production problem because quantitative strategies don't last forever. The markets are very competitive. Strategies work for a while but over time become more widely known and deployed.
"Because of that, alpha in the strategy gets competed away. Therefore in order to be successful you have to have very large research output: it's not enough to just find a good strategy, you need to continually find good strategies over time."
Newsweek is hosting an AI and Data Science in Capital Markets conference on December 6-7 in New York.  Photo: NewsweekMediaGroup
Quantopian has brought the internet to bear to the research production problem. This has turned out to be a highly scalable solution. The platform has doubled its community year over year and has over 140,000 members now around the world.
When someone has created a strategy that has survived Quantopian's rigorous analysis and testing, the author may achieve a capital allocation. The largest single allocation Quantopian has made to date has been $10m, said Larkin. "I can tell you when a community member gets the first email inviting him or her to our diligence process to discuss a strategy that they have developed, and that we have discovered, vetted, and validated, it's an extraordinarily exciting moment for them."
The algorithm authors and community members own their IP from day one and they retain ownership of their code and research, which is encrypted on the Quantopian platform. Quantopian licenses strategies it believes are exceptional.
An author of a licensed strategy is typically paid 10% of the net profits of his or her strategy. Hypothetically, in the case of a $10m allocation to a strategy that produces a net annual return of 10% (or $1m in net profits), the author would be paid $100,000. As such, even at these initial allocation levels, an author can earn a meaningful payout.
Larkin makes the point that finance is a latecomer to the crowdsourcing game.
Crowdsourcing has proved very effective in other domains, starting back with the Netflix Prize in 2006. Today you can find people doing varying activities, like protein folding, through crowdsourced websites.
In order to harness the wisdom of crowds successfully, certain features need to be present. One of the necessary features is standardisation. In the case of finance, standardisation comes from the use of performance analytics. "At Quantopian we use a range of studies and performance analytics to evaluate strategies," said Larkin. "We can take very diverse strategies and analyse them in a standardised way, looking at metrics such as Sharpe ratio and exposure to common risk factors. Finance lends itself very well to standardisation."
"A second feature is independence: the crowd must do independent work. Quant finance practitioners are very cautious to protect their IP and their strategy ideas; because of that, when authors create the core of their strategies they do it in isolation.
"A third criterion is that the whole must be greater than the sum of the parts. Modern portfolio theory tells you that when you form a portfolio of uncorrelated strategies, mathematically, the whole will be more valuable than the individuals."
Quantopian has an active community with over 10,000 posts on the community forum last year. The platform also offers free educational content; there are some 50 lectures available. "We bring together people around the world to discuss challenges and opportunities in strategy development," said Larkin.
"This is a difficult business. Only a small percentage of community members will likely get an allocation to their strategies. However, everyone who comes to Quantopian is better off for it because they have the opportunity learn something. They have the opportunity to get exposure and insight to a field which historically has been closed off except to a very narrow segment of the population."
Concluding, Larkin warned of the many failure modes in the design, research and implementation of quantitative strategies such as overfitting, and ensuring data is high quality and without look-ahead bias.
"Data integrity is essential. You must keep it point-in-time," he said, "and you need many datasets. Those datasets need to be integrated, symbol mapped to a single identifier over time, time aligned, and properly corporate action adjusted. This aspect of quantitative investing is not very glamorous or exciting, but it is absolutely essential. Quantopian does this in a world class way, for free, for our community members."


London headquartered big data specialist Neudata has released the much-anticipated version 2 of its online Neudata Scout digital data intelligence platform. Neudata provides hedge funds and other institutional investment managers with metadata about the vast array of alternative datasets available for selecting and back testing the most appropriate sources for alpha generation.
It takes a lot of resources to back test some datasets and a lot of them are quite dirty and need a lot of work to be tagged and structured. There are only a few well-funded data-centric funds that have those in-house capabilities; many are now realising the importance and playing catch-up.

The flip side is that many companies, which are not established data providers, are looking to monetise their data and do not yet have a network of clients. This is where Neudata can come in to assist them.
Appraising version 2 of the platform, Rado Lipuš, founder and chief executive officer of Neudata said: "We listened carefully to feedback from our audience of quantitative investment managers and greatly enhanced the functionality and new features available on the Neudata Scout platform.
"We expanded the navigation and filtering components so that managers can more easily pinpoint relevant data sources for a specific investment universe, or search for specific stocks, products or even brands.
"Also among the new features is a robust content management capability for users to add relevant and useful notes. All of this makes it easier for investment professionals to perform critical functions such as discovering, assessing and selecting the best sources of data sets for their particular investment research needs."
Many of Neudata's clients log in to the Neudata Scout platform on a daily basis in order to identify the latest alternative datasets and source providers that are continuously being added, he said.
Data providers span the universe from early-stage, still below-radar data providers compiling unique data, to established data providers assembling novel datasets for a limited number of investment management clients, to larger "exhaust-data" providers who often incidentally collect and aggregate less mainstream data that can be incredibly useful to investors.
Neudata recently hired Stephen Morse, former head of global financial data partnerships at Twitter, as an advisor based in New York City, bringing Neudata's alternative data intelligence platform to US hedge fund managers and other institutional investors.


Gaurav Chakravorty, co-founder of AI investment advisors qplum, likes to use sporting analogies to illustrate changing trends within finance. The way high frequency trading (HFT) seemed to work like magic in the old days reminds him of Manchester United under Sir Alex Ferguson.
Between 1993 and 2013 Manchester United won the English Premier League 13 times, an incredible record. The truth was Ferguson used a machinery that other clubs had not yet happened upon. He would scout clubs in Europe for talented youngsters and be willing to pay top dollar for young stars without a proven track record at a big club. The best example is Christiano Ronaldo. This "technology" when it worked looked amazing. But today almost every club uses the same method so it no longer works like it did for Manchester United – just look at Paul Pogba."

"So it's the same with HFTs," said Chakravorty. "In the crisis years they may have made a bunch of money. Now it's completely about using machine learning methods. They [the media] tend to make the focus of HFT all about latency, how fast you are. I mean fast helps. But it's sort of like being tall on a basketball court. It definitely helps but you don't win matches by being tall."
Chakravorty, a veteran of HFT, also says that describing it as a trading strategy is like saying that microwaving food is a recipe. Machine learning is key to what HFT actually does, which is attempting to ascertain the size of orders as they are being placed into the marketplace. "Inferring the real intent of market participants is what HFT is about. It used to be a much simpler problem back in the day when people were just placing orders without really thinking. Now it's tougher.
"So you would try to see different statistics: how long has the order been in the book, whether it has been placed just after a market event, or if it's just been placed when the market opens. And you try to gauge whether the size is abnormally large compared to other sizes. So every single feature of those orders would be passed into this robo-brain, which would give you a guess of what is going to happen."
Chakravorty explained there has now been a kind of cross-pollination where firms like Goldman Sachs Asset Management and some hedge funds have started using machine learning algorithms that HFT uses. "Sometimes they would get an ex-HFT guy to come in and redesign the execution system. So when they have to place an order of size 200,000 they break it up into small chunks of size 100 so that nobody can see that order, and place it at just the right time. Strictly speaking if everybody is using the same algorithms then there is no way to distinguish a dumb order from a smart one."
These days Chakravorty spends a lot of time explaining how deep learning algorithms can be applied to finance. We have seen an evolution from trend following in the 1980s, to more complex statistical arbitrage in the 90's, which was followed by machine learning and HFT coming to the fore around 2005. Most recently, big increases in computing power combined with the sheer amount of data available have provided the scale for deep learning approaches.
Rather than learning to predict things in a kind of hardcoded, supervised manner, deep learning techniques operate more like a human brain, filtering through data and learning the important signals. For example, a person driving down a road that hits a pothole will probably slow down; they don't have to hit 100 of them.
In order to try and encode the social science component of why a person might click on a certain advert, or trade a certain stock, deep learning algorithms use layers of nodes, some of which filter lots of data into summaries and then learn to make assumptions from these.
"Actually summarising data is an easier problem than making predictions," said Chakravorty. "It's about trying to learn how people trade. We are building this huge brain-like thing, which is looking at all the data in the markets and figuring out what are the summaries and from those summaries can I predict what will happen?"


Six passengers aboard a JetBlue Airlines flight Monday from New York to Palm Beach, Florida, were evaluated by medics and two who were taken to a hospital for a burning sensation in their eyes after mechanical issues forced an emergency landing at Raleigh-Durham International Airport in North Carolina.
Wake County EMS spokesman Jeffrey Hammerstein confirmed the report Monday to the Associated Press and noted passengers reported both a burning sensation in their eyes and headaches. None of the medical issues were life-threatening.
Flight tracker  Flightaware reported that the aircraft departed LaGuardia Airport in New York at 7:29 a.m. EDT. After being diverted to the North Carolina airport, the plane eventually landed at Palm Beach International Airport at 4:52 p.m. — more than six hours late to its destination.
JetBlue did not provide specifics of the incident. A representative for the New York-based company did not immediately return International Business Times’ request for comment.
There have been multiple reports of odors grounding JetBlue flights in recent months.
On Aug. 16, two JetBlue crew members reportedly fell ill aboard a flight from Boston to Charleston, South Carolina. The carrier later told IBT that the source of the odor was nail polish.
Six days earlier, a JetBlue flight from Boston to San Diego was  forced to make an emergency landing in Buffalo after a gasoline smell from the wing of the plane caused dizziness for the pilot and two flight attendants.
“They were saying that there was an incident on the plane where somebody was having a medical issue,” passenger Michael Feuerstein told  Fox-affiliate WFXT in Boston. “People were having headaches on the plane. There were children. The smell could be smelled from the wings of the plane to the actual back of the plane.”
Feuerstein also said he saw “fluid leaking from an overhead baggage compartment,” according to reports.
A JetBlue spokesman said that the incident was under investigation.
In July, a JetBlue flight from John F. Kennedy Airport in New York to Buffalo was forced to make an air return to JFK shortly after takeoff due to an odor in the cockpit. In June, a JetBlue flight from Newark, New Jersey, to West Palm Beach, Florida, was forced to land in Atlantic City, New Jersey, after smoke filled the cockpit.

Public-private partnerships are frequently portrayed, especially  by President Donald Trump, as an easy infrastructure fix for cities and states with tight budgets. But horror stories of so-called “P3s” gone wrong have been making headlines for the past decade, often as a result of contractual clauses that prove costly for governments or keep information from the public eye. They don’t have to be that way.
The U.S. is just beginning to catch up to many of its fellow developed nations in its use of P3s to finance infrastructure, and with  $4.6 trillion in construction needs on the table and a White House that’s fully embraced such financing, that trend is sure to pick up. Below are five examples of P3 contracts that drew public ire, and how future dealmakers can avoid such pitfalls.
In Virginia, The State Government Couldn’t Compete With Its Private Partner
As part of its deal with the state of Virginia, Elizabeth River Crossings OpCo LLC — a consortium  led by Sydney-based investor Macquarie Group and the Swedish firm Skanska A.B., along with American construction firms Weeks Marine Inc. and Kiewit Construction Co. — received contractual assurance that its toll income would maintain some stability over the course of the 58-year agreement.
Although the  frequently-asked-questions section of the ERC’s site says “there is no guaranteed compensation” for the state’s construction of competing roadways, a 2012 analysis by the firm of the project  obtained by the Washington Post suggests otherwise. The analysis, according to the Post, ensured that ERC would be “made whole” by a non-compete agreement, citing the potential for $774 million in total compensation from the state if several nearby transportation projects came to fruition. (In five states, strict non-compete agreements, in which the government is contractually barred from constructing a competing roadway, are outlawed. But non-strict agreeements, in which a concessionaire like ERC can petition for compensation, are commonplace.)
As part of the deal with Elizabeth River Crossings OpCo LLC, the state of Virginia had to pay the consortium in the event that it built roadways or tunnels that would compete with the private operators for tolling revenue. Above, a woman was photographed along the Elizabeth River in Portsmouth, Virginia, as Hurricane Sandy hit the state, Oct. 28, 2012.  Photo: Reuters
Corporations engaging in P3s likely learned from the Dulles Greenway project’s fallout that inserting non-compete agreements in their contracts is a great way to keep revenues afloat with a steady stream of elevated tolls or other payments for use of the asset. (The private consortium operating the Dulles Greenway  defaulted one year into its 42-year agreement with the Virginia DOT after the state finished a competing project ahead of schedule, siphoning off the Greenway’s traffic.)
Shahrzad Habibi, research and policy director at the contracting think tank In the Public Interest, told International Business Times that clauses forcing transportation departments to pay for renovating or building nearby developments “tie the hands of the city or state government for a long time” and “should certainly give a city [or state] pause before entering into such an agreement.”
“It’s not a business agreement. It’s an agreement between a government and a corporation,” she said. “It’s a government that’s representing the people. At the end of the day, you’re inserting private interests into public infrastructure.”
John Buttarazzi, an adjunct professor at Georgetown University’s McCourt School of Public Policy, disputed the notion that P3s aren’t business transactions, but stressed the importance of skilled negotiation on the part of the government entity.
“When it comes to non-compete clauses, they’re negotiating points. If a company wants a non-compete clause, the city [or state] should get something [in return],” he said. “They need to have good advisers. The companies that do this, they know P3s — they live and breathe P3s. The [government] staff, as smart as they are in their departments, they probably only do one P3 in their career.”
Pennsylvania Leased Its Bridges, But Still Paid For Them
In 2015, a  consortium led by the Melbourne-based Plenary Group and three subsidiaries of the Chicago construction conglomerate Walsh Group launched a 28-year project to reconstruct and maintain 558 of Pennsylvania’s  4,350-plus ailing bridges, many of them rural. Instead of requiring drivers to pay tolls to cross them, the  agreement required the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation to provide the consortium, Plenary Walsh Keystone Partners, with  $35.8 million in regular “availability payments” and $224.7 million in periodic milestone payments and contributions to the consortium’s Mobilization Fund. The remaining financing stemmed from  $721.5 million in  private activity bonds issued by the U.S. Department of Transportation and $59.4 million in equity from the consortium.
Although the deal cost taxpayers 30 percent less than the renovations would had the state reconstructed the bridges itself, the cost to PennDOT drew  criticism for potentially giving Plenary Walsh an incentive to spend only enough money on construction of bridges for them to function optimally within the consortium’s 25-year maintenance period, according to a  report on the project from the Bipartisan Policy Center. (Other  estimates peg the discount at 20 percent.)
Pennsylvania avoided user fees when it struck a P3 deal to repair hundreds of predominantly rural bridges, but that didn't mean the state got a slew of free renovations. Above, the 114-year-old Pond Eddy Bridge over the Delaware River between Shohola Township, Pennsylvania, and Pond Eddy, New York, was photographed July 21, 2014.  Photo: Reuters
As Habibi told IBT, availability payments are just one funding mechanism that debunks the myth of a corporation swooping in to cover infrastructure expenses at no cost to taxpayers.
“You and I are the ways these things get paid back. It doesn’t matter whether it’s a P3 or public funding,” Habibi said, adding that governments may be attracted to P3s with availability payments because the financing method appears less costly than it actually is. “If you’re a city and you issue a bond, that debt shows up on your balance sheet. But if you’re paying an availability payment, that doesn’t show up on your balance sheet, but you’re still obligated to pay that availability fee.”
According to Buttarazzi, while such misconceptions have certainly been prevalent among state and local governments using P3s, they’ve more recently adjusted their thinking.
“Sometimes political leaders fall into a trap where they don’t have enough money, and they look at these firms and say, ‘They have the money.’ But the firms are looking at the rate of return, because they want to make money as well,” he said. “Now they understand that it’s alternative financing, but it’s still financing… The government’s transferring risk that it otherwise might have.”
P3 projects using availability payment models made up 29 percent of closed deals between 2008 and 2013, but 61 percent of projects at the pre-launch stage in the latter year relied on availability payments for financing and as a way to “reduce exposure to revenue volatility,” according to a 2015 Treasury Department  report on the market for P3 deals in infrastructure. As alternatives, the Treasury suggested several other financing mechanisms that allow governments and private companies to shoulder the costs more equally, such as price caps, limits on the return on investment and sharing of profits.
When The Indiana Toll Road Was Up For Grabs Again, The State Kept Its Advisory Report Secret
The Indiana Toll Road project suffered  multiple problems: sharp declines in bridge quality, quickly rising tolls, the concessionaire’s bankruptcy and a subsequent refusal by then-Governor Mike Pence to take the road back, among others. Throughout those debacles, the Indiana Toll Road Concessionaire Company, headed by Macquarie and Spanish infrastructure company Cintra S.A., and the Indiana Finance Authority — like entities in many other P3 deals — had broad contractual authority to shield aspects of the deal from public records requests.
A provision on information disclosures in the Indiana Toll Road’s  contract begins with a note of transparency, requiring compliance with the state’s open records laws, but that transparency is followed by a litany of caveats that effectively let the ITRCC decide what ought to be public — and allowed the IFA to protect those decisions.
As part of an effort to promote the White House's infrastructure plans, Vice President Mike Pence headed to the home of many large stakeholders in American infrastructure projects, including one in his home state. Above, he was photographed petting a kangaroo on a visit to the Taronga Zoo with wife Karen and daughters Charlotte and Audrey in Sydney, April 23, 2017.  Photo: Reuters
When IBT sought, through a Freedom of Information Act request, access to a report  conducted by the auditor KPMG that assisted the IFA in deciding on a lessee to replace the bankrupt toll road operator between late 2014 and early 2015, the IFA rejected the request on the grounds that the information was proprietary. It  did the same when a group of northern Indiana counties bidding for a takeover of the road sought the same report a year and a half earlier. In May of 2015, the IFA  approved the sale of the ITRCC to the Australian firm IFM investors for  $5.725 billion.
Texas Blocked Release Of Traffic Projections For State Highway 130
Texas’ State Highway 130 Concession Company, which manages a barren 41-mile stretch of roadway connecting Dallas to San Antonio, makes for a solid case against the shielding of records and reports on P3 finances and analysis from public view. The consortium, formerly led by Cintra, the San Antonio-based firm Zachry Construction Corp. and the Australian investor Hastings Funds Management,  emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy in late June after paying the Texas Department of Transportation  $100 million to raise the speed limit to 85 miles per hour in an effort to attract more drivers.
It’s unclear whether or not the Texas DOT or the consortium knew, or at least suspected, that the road would be virtually vacant, as the latter refused to release its traffic projections, even after the San Antonio Express-News filed a FOIA request. The DOT and the Texas Attorney General’s Office had declared the information proprietary, wrote Express-News reporter Katherine Blunt in an extensive  report on the project.
Among myriad other issues associated with the project, including the concessionaire's bankruptcy, the Texas Transportation Department blocked the release of analysis that may have foreseen State Highway 130's absent traffic. Above, cars were photographed traveling on an almost deserted snow covered downtown highway after an overnight storm dropped five inches of snow in Dallas, Feb. 4, 2011.  Photo: Reuters
The state had the right to withhold the report, as its  contract stated explicitly in language similar to that of the Indiana Toll Road, with a public access-friendly introduction devolving into secrecy-oriented conditions that give the consortium wide discretion to decide what they’d like released.
“If Developer or its Affiliates believe(s) information or materials submitted to TxDOT constitute trade secrets, proprietary information or other information that is not subject to… [or] is excepted from disclosure under the Public Information Act, Developer or its Affiliates shall be solely responsible for specifically and conspicuously designating that information by placing ‘CONFIDENTIAL’ in the center header of each document or page affected, as it determines to be appropriate so as to clearly identify any specific proprietary information, trade secrets or confidential commercial and financial information.”
Chicago’s Parking Meter Deal Was Fast And Furious  —  And Cost The City Dearly
In addition to a non-compete agreement and an open-records provision nearly identical to that of the Indiana Toll Road contract, the city of Chicago’s parking meter  contract with a concessionaire led by the investment bank Morgan Stanley requires the city to pay the concessionaire if, for any reason, the city needs the parking spaces for some other purpose. Those uses include, per the contract, “street closures, the closure of a street to vehicular traffic, emergency parking bans, weather related closures, sidewalk closures related to building construction, sidewalk construction or repair, street construction or repair, utility work and similar activities.”
That measure was just one of many issues for the city in the development and execution of the deal. As detailed in a 2013  report by the Chicago Inspector General, the rush to approve the lease under budget deadline pressure led the city to give up its parking meters for 75 years for about half of their actual value. Parking meter rates doubled and in some cases quadrupled in just five years under the agreement. Prior to the Chicago City Council hearing on the deal, “no analysis was produced that examined the public policy and financial implications of the lease agreement,” according to the report. The City Council’s approval came just three days after the Morgan Stanley-led consortium won the bid for control of the meters, and, “as many aldermen pointed out,” the Inspector General report continued, “this left little time for public discussion or scrutiny of the parking-meter lease agreement.”
As they struggled to close ballooning budget deficits amid the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, many state and local governments found themselves tempted to follow the example of Chicago. Above, parking meters run by LAZ Parking for Morgan Stanley were pictured in Chicago, March 18, 2009.  Photo: Reuters
In an interview with IBT, Habibi emphasized the importance of lengthy public discussion and extensive independent analysis as governments and private firms iron out these massive, multi-decade deals.
“Before you even get to the contract phase, you have to have a really, really robust analysis… a super robust value-for-money analysis that not only looks at the costs but looks at what the community values as well,” Habibi said, adding that “ample public input” is necessary for any type of infrastructure project. The government should be sure it “has sufficient financial and legal expertise to be able to negotiate the project before the deal is signed,” and should consider “disadvantaged communities to make sure they have access to infrastructure,” she said.
But the mandate that the city pay for closure of the metered spaces remains in the amended 2013 version of the contract. According to Buttazarri, that’s part of the deal that comes with privatization.
“Too often, people talk about P3s and they understand the public part and they understand the private part, but it’s a balance between two parties,” he said. “These are business transactions.”  
Still, Buttazarri echoed Habibi when asked whether the city should’ve slowed down approval of the agreement.
“Whether it’s Chicago’s parking meters or other projects, people think the most difficult part of P3s is the finance. It’s not. In the end, that’s just math,” he said. “In the end, the most important thing is including the public and the stakeholders in the process.”


A New Mexico woman aboard an Allegiant Air called an extended delay on the tarmac at the Albuquerque International Sunport last week “false imprisonment” in extreme conditions.
Celena Kwitkowski alleged that passengers were held Thursday for well over three hours on a hot plane without water or lavatory access. The airline said the incident resulted from a “minor mechanical issue” as well as “an altercation between passengers.”
“They need to apologize for us, they need to take responsibility and ownership,” Kwitkowski  told Albuquerque NBC-affiliate KOB4. “As far as I'm concerned, this was false imprisonment.”
KOB4 reported Friday that Allegiant Air Flight 471 to Las Vegas was scheduled to leave around 5 p.m. MDT. But a  record from Flightaware states the Thursday evening flight did not depart well after 8:00 p.m., making the flight more than five hours late to its destination.
“Approximately around 7:30-ish, people were getting aggravated,” Kwitkowski said. “It started getting warm on the plane because the air was not on. Before 9:00, they actually locked the bathroom doors and said we were not allowed to use the bathroom.”
Video recorded by Kwitkowski on her cellphone and shared with KOB showed tension during the delay, during which time she alleged that an elderly man asked a flight attendant if he could leave the plane. A clip from the exchange revealed a flight attendant told the man that if he exited the craft he would not be allowed to reboard.
“It was burning hot,” Kwitkowski said. “They had no air on this airplane. We were melting.”
Allegiant Air told the news outlet there was a “combination of factors” that led to the delay and added that the incident was a “highly unusual situation.” 
“Initially, there was a minor mechanical issue which caused a delay after passengers had boarded.  It took longer than expected to address, so delayed the flight a little over an hour,” Allegiant Air told KOB4. “After the aircraft pushed back, it returned to the gate due to an altercation between passengers. Local law enforcement was called to escort the individuals involved off of the aircraft, and those passengers' bags were also removed. There were a few other passengers who were not involved, but also requested to deplane at that time. All told, this activity delayed departure about another hour.”
The airline then addressed an inquiry made about air conditioning aboard the plane. Allegiant Air said that while it would have been running because the aircraft was powered, the strength of the airflow in the plane’s cabin would have been “quite a bit lower at the gate or taxiing than it is once the aircraft gets up to full power in flight.”
In spite of Kwitkowski’s allegations, the airline maintained that it did, in fact, provide its passengers with both tap and bottled water.
“Our logs and reports do show that the crew supplied water (what's called a 'poor service' where cups of water are distributed) during the initial delay,” the airline said. “Also, at the time the flight returned to the gate, the crew requested Allegiant station staff to bring bottles of water to the plane, which were distributed to passengers.”
Kwitkowski told KOB4 that she has type 2 diabetes and wasn’t feeling well after the plane finally arrived at its Nevada destination. The airline apologized to passengers aboard the flight in a statement to International Business Times.
“We regret that this delayed our passengers and impacted their comfort, but thank them for their patience and understanding,” the airline said. “Please also be aware that because of the inconvenience caused by these delays, passengers were issued vouchers towards future travel on Allegiant.”

Six days after the deadly white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, Steve Bannon was asked to leave his post as chief strategist to President Donald Trump. By that evening, Bannon was hosting an editorial meeting as chairman of Breitbart News, which he has described as “  the platform of the alt-right.” But even as he returned, advertisers were fleeing the site known for publishing conspiracy theories and racist, sexist and anti-immigrant content.
In the aftermath of Charlottesville, high-profile CEOs quit their White House advisory posts in protest of the president’s equivocal comments about white supremacists, and companies scurried to distance themselves from white nationalist and neo-Nazi clients —  causing them to move to  underground, and less popular, online services.
After a  tweet pointed out that domain registrar GoDaddy provided neo-Nazi site the Daily Stormer its web address, the company, and then Google’s domain services,  cut off the site because its racist and anti-Semitic content violated their terms of service. Two days later, Cloudflare, the company that provided the site with security protections,  dropped the Daily Stormer, the first time it had ever cut off a client for political reasons.
Airbnb had  banned white nationalist users in anticipation of the Unite the Right events in Charlottesville. In response to a Digital Music News  article on August 14, the Spotify music streaming service  canceled the accounts of numerous neo-Nazi and white supremacist bands. Gamer chat app Discord  banned Daily Stormer and other white supremacist channels. Facebook  removed links to a particularly offensive Daily Stormer article and, along with Reddit, is “actively  banning groups and pages linked to far-right extremists,” according to the Guardian. And earlier this year, the Germany-based audio streaming service Soundcloud took down the accounts of the prominent “alt-right” website AltRight.com and several others that publish racist and bigoted content, which violates the company’s Terms of Use.

The recent efforts to “de-platform” white nationalists come after an online group of anonymous activists began chipping away at Breitbart’s ad revenue months ago. Calling itself Sleeping Giants, the group has been urging companies, on Twitter, to pull their advertising from Breitbart News since last November, shortly after the presidential election.
The creators realized that many companies — which buy ad packages through Google AdSense, Facebook and Taboola — often unknowingly have ads running on the Breitbart website. Some companies buying Facebook ads, for example, have no idea that the ads will also appear on other sites outside of Facebook, one founder of Sleeping Giants told International Business Times. (He maintained his anonymity but was reached through the main, verified Sleeping Giants Twitter account.)
“We’ve had a lot of complaints,” the founder said. “Companies were very angry that they weren’t warned” about where their ads would end up.
The Sleeping Giants team began its campaign by tweeting at various companies, letting them know their ads appeared at Breitbart and explaining how to get rid of them. The tactic was a surprising success. Many companies blacklisted Breitbart from its ad buys, and a growing number of Twitter users took note and helped inform companies of their ad placement at the far-right hub of the racist “alt-right.”
“We didn’t think this would be more than two weeks long, so to say that it’s met or exceeded our expectations is not even close,” said the Sleeping Giants organizer. The primary Sleeping Giants Twitter account boasted nearly 105,000 followers as of August 22.
Now, roughly eight months after Sleeping Giants began this effort, nearly  2,600 companies have removed their ads from Breitbart. The flow of deserting companies has quickened since the Charlottesville rally, the organizer said. These days, 15 to 20 companies are dropping Breitbart each day. Among those that have ditched Breitbart are Aveda, CVS, Etsy, Kellogg and TurboTax. Amazon, however, remains a holdout, despite  employee efforts to persuade the company to remove its ads.

It’s hard to determine how much ad revenue Breitbart, a private company, has lost. But Media Radar  found that from March to May, Breitbart lost 90 percent of its advertisers, as well as some of its traffic. Alex Marlow, editor-in-chief of Breitbart News,  told the New York Times Magazine that the Sleeping Giants campaign is causing “severe” internal problems. “It’s a fight,” he told the Times. The loss of ads from large companies must hurt, notes the Sleeping Giants member. “With programmatic advertising, if you have fewer large advertisers it drives down the cost per impression… You can tell [Breitbart is] getting paid way less for placement.”
Sleeping Giants is also trying to get Disqus, the company that Breitbart pays to power its comment section, to stop providing services to the site. The company has clear terms of service that ban hate speech, yet it still maintains Breitbart’s comment sections. “That’s a real head-scratcher,” says the Sleeping Giants organizer. Breitbart’s readers  engage with its comment section, known for its incendiary content, ten times more than readers of the New York Times website.
Advocates of de-platforming have contradicted the criticism that they’re violating First Amendment protections for free speech. “These are private and public businesses; they’re not the government,” said the Sleeping Giants member. When clients sign a private company’s community guidelines, they acknowledge that their accounts may be terminated if they don’t adhere to the rules, and prohibitions against hate speech are common.
Some companies don’t enforce their terms well enough, says Sleeping Giants. “If you have terms of service and lay them out clearly, you need to follow them. [Businesses] have to decide whether it’s morally right to make money from clients that denigrate people or organize violent rallies.”
President Trump’s inflammatory comments have cost his own company as well. The Trump Organization — in which he is still invested — has seen 17 charities cancel Mar-a-lago events in recent days. The Cleveland Clinic, American Red Cross and the Susan G. Komen Foundation are among the nonprofits that have said they will hold their events elsewhere.
Breitbart, the Daily Stormer and other white nationalist websites are taking heat from other companies, but will likely continue to have a steady, albeit small, following. A recent  poll from ABC News/Washington Post found that 9 percent of Americans think it’s acceptable to hold neo-Nazi or white supremacist views; two-thirds of Republicans  approve of how Trump handled the Charlottesville crisis, per a recent CBS poll. And other individuals affiliated with Breitbart — namely, deputy assistant to the president  Sebastian Gorka, who reportedly pledged lifetime allegiance to a neo-Nazi hate group in Hungary, and special assistant to the president  Julia Hahn, who was one of Bannon’s top writers at Breitbart — remain in the White House.


Joining a host of similar reports in recent weeks, a Delta Air Lines flight was diverted Tuesday after an odor was detected in the plane’s cabin. Delta Air Lines Flight 981 from Boston to Atlanta was reportedly diverted to John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York “out of an abundance of caution.”
The source of the odor remained unclear Tuesday evening, the airline told International Business Times in a statement that maintenance technicians evaluated the plane and were making the necessary repairs. According to a representative for the carrier, the aircraft landed safely and without incident.
“We are rebooking customers on alternate flights,” the airline said. “Safety is always Delta's number one priority and we apologize to our customers for the inconvenience.”
The  Aviation Herald reported Tuesday that there were 158 passengers on board the flight. The plane was near JFK when the crew reported fumes in the back of the plane. And though the flight was diverted, they did not declare the incident an emergency.
“The aircraft turned around and was descending through about FL150 when the crew declared emergency,” the Herald reported. “The aircraft continued for a safe landing on JFK's runway 22R, vacated onto runway 31L, advised that no further assistance was needed and taxied to the apron.”
Incidents of odors disrupting flights or passengers have made frequent headlines in recent weeks, most notably in incidents involving budget carrier JetBlue Airways. The airline last week said that  two of its crew members fell ill aboard a Wednesday flight and later pointed to nail polish as the source of the odor. The Associated Press reported at the time that it was the third incident in involving an odor being reported on JetBlue Airways flights in just a week.
A similar  incident occurred on a JetBlue Airways flight from California to Florida earlier this month. The plane was diverted to an airport in Oklahoma City after an odor emitted from the cockpit. After eight ambulances arrived on the scene, five of the flight’s 135 passengers were treated for breathing problems.​

Looking to book your next vacation? Cheap Flight Day, which is slated for Aug. 23, will kick off discounted airfare and continue through November, according to reports. It’s not so much a day as it is a period of time, say experts, but travel companies maintain that savings could be significant.
The quasi-holiday marks the time around which most airlines begin to lower their fares after coming off of a peak travel period during summer months. Some airlines drop their airfare premiums by 10 to 20 percent, which can mean substantial savings for some potential travelers, Forbes reported this week.
Data reported by online travel agency CheapOair found that the average price savings for popular travel destinations would fall 14 percent for domestic travel and 30 percent for international travel, according to a Tuesday  press release from the company.
“As summer quickly comes to a close, so does the busiest time of the year for travel,” Sanjay Hathiramani, Global SVP of Supplier Relations for CheapOair, said in a statement. “Kids are back to school, the weather starts to cool down and people are gearing up for the holidays. As the demand for airfare decreases, so do the fares.”
According to the travel company, purchasing international flights during the window could potentially lead to hundreds of dollars in savings. Flying to Manila, Philippines, could potentially save a traveler $300, while tickets to Madrid or Barcelona in Spain could be slashed by $250 and $200, respectively. Rome and Bangkok fares could fall by $200 and $250, and a trip to Paris could see potential savings of $150 if purchased during the timeframe.
As for domestic flights? Savings to some of the most popular destinations in the nation — including Los Angeles, Boston and Nashville — could see between $20-50 in savings depending on the city. While not nearly as steep as the savings on international flights, significant savings could add up for individuals looking to purchase more than one ticket.
“Cheap Flight Day isn't just one day of deals — it’s the start of the off peak season,” Hathiramani said. “Fares are going to continue to stay low until Thanksgiving. Especially for those looking for deals to international destinations, the time to book your tickets are during this window, beginning at the end of August.”
Cheap Flight Day certainly has its critics. George Hobica, the founder of airfarewatchdog.com,  told Condé Nast Traveler earlier this month that the rumor of a premier day of the year to buy flights has been around “been around for a decade” and called it “huge disservice to the public because people want a formula.”
However, Rick Seaney, the CEO and co-founder of farecompare.com, told Condé Nast Traveler that the discount is found in departure dates that fall within the golden window, rather than the dates of purchase. He also noted that days of the week are important when booking flights.
“Tuesday, Wednesday, and Saturday for date of departure are usually on the cheaper end,” he said.
Seaney’s claim was in part corroborated by Amanda Festa, a Cheapflights.com editor, who  told Refinery29 that the best time to book travel at a discount is between late September and early November. She also recommended shopping around for potential bargains.
“Don't fear buyer’s remorse: Do be aware that, by U.S. law, airlines must offer you the chance to hold a price or cancel a purchase on any non-refundable ticket bought at least seven days in advance for a 24-hour period,” Festa said, noting that it allows shoppers the “opportunity to keep shopping just in case you can score an even better deal.”

A bodyguard reportedly fired his weapon on an airplane while passengers boarded around 8 a.m. Monday morning in Berlin.
A gun went off inside the jet bridge when passengers boarded a flight from Berlin’s Tegel Airport to Cologne, Germany. It was a German bodyguard who accidentally fired his pistol while he boarded the airplane, according to Germany’s The Local Monday.
The man reportedly worked for the Berlin Office of Criminal Investigation. He was tasked with protecting a "high ranking" Iraqi diplomat and new to the job, according to The Local.
The bullet ripped a hole in the jet bridge, which connected the terminal to the plane. Passengers were reportedly unharmed during the incident.
Travelers took to social media and described Monday's incident. Passenger Jürgen Trittin, a representative for the Green Party, shared his experience on Twitter.

&mdash; Jürgen Trittin (@JTrittin) August 21, 2017
Another flier said he sat three seats away from the bodyguard who fired his weapon. The passenger claimed that the bodyguard was "very nervous." He lamented about how guns should be kept safely with the captain in the cockpit.
The flight was reportedly delayed about 90 minutes before taking off. Police are investigating the incident to see if any violations occurred.
Federal Police spokesman Thorsten Peters told local Berlin newspaper The Berliner that "luckily, no one was injured" during the incident.
"We need to now investigate why the shot was fired. It is certainly unusual that something like this happened," a police spokesman said.
This wasn’t the first time an official fired a gun on an airplane. A gun carried by a U.S. Airways pilot reportedly went off on a flight to South Carolina in 2008, this was the first time a weapon issued under a federal program to arm pilots went off, authorities told CBS News.
The accidental gunshot happened aboard Flight 1536 from Denver, Colorado, to Charlotte, North Carolina. Passengers were unharmed by the incident, Greg Alter of the Federal Air Marshal Service told CBS News.
"We know that there was never any danger to the aircraft or to the occupants on board," Alter said.
The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) started the Flight Deck Officer program to train cockpit personnel after terrorists took over a flight during the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks. The program intended for pilots and other flight personnel to defend themselves should an attack occur.
Mike Boyd, who manages an aviation consulting firm The Boyd Group in Colorado, told CBS News that the TSA was put in an awkward position once Congress approved the program.
"The TSA has never been real supportive of this program," Boyd said. "It's something I think Congress kind of put on them.
Boyd claimed he supported the program to arm pilots with guns. However, he added that the incident could have been much worse.
"If somebody who has the ability to fly a 747 across the Pacific wants a gun, you give it to them," he said. "If that bullet had compromised the shell of the airplane, gone through a window, the airplane could have gone down."

Sunglasses, headphones, neck pillows: these are all possible items that could be left behind at an airport. But when it comes to Dublin Airport, the objects in the lost and found bin are much more bizarre. Included in the strange mix were a headstone with the ironic epitaph, “You will never be forgotten,” a turtle and a toilet seat.
So how did someone just leave behind a headstone? A few years ago, the owner “misplaced” the item at a drop-off point to the departures area, DAA spokeswoman Audrey O'Hagan told The Herald Monday.
Also left in the departure entrance of the airport were human ashes, false teeth, a life-size mannequin and a glass eye. These items could be retrieved within a year of being abandoned, The Herald wrote.
Among the more popular items to be discarded were crutches and wheelchairs. O’Hagan joked to The Herald that the airport staff wondered if there were “some miraculous recoveries have taken place within the terminals.”

As for the live turtle, it wasn’t forgotten. A passenger attempted to smuggle the turtle in their pocket. When security guards discovered it, the turtle was handed over to a family member who was not going on the flight. The animal was not harmed.
It seems like people attempted to bring everything, including the kitchen sink. While this is normally a metaphor, airport staff once caught a traveler attempted to sneak a kitchen sink in their hand luggage.
Most recently, a passenger left behind a set of “cast iron dungeon keys” June 11 and a month later a “brown envelope” was found. The Herald didn’t reveal what items the “brown envelope” contained.
While people leave behind strange items at the airport, some might argue flight attendants must follow some bizarre rules. In Russia, a flight attendant is suing Russia’s top airline Aeroflot for discrimination. She claimed she was demoted because she was “old, fat and ugly.”
“Right now there’s a policy that a flight attendant has to be sexually attractive,” Yevgeniya Magurina told the Associated Press Monday. “But our role onboard is different: it’s to ensure safety, not to be an object of sexual desire. This is wrong and hurtful.” She added: “No one cares about professionalism — you have to be young, slim and pretty.”
 Magurina, 42, said the airline stopped making her size last year. A few months later, she was demoted without being notified. She had showed up to go on an international flight, but wasn’t able to take the job. Previously, she had been a senior flight attendant, but was downgraded to a junior attendant, which meant she wasn’t given the coveted jobs.
“You scan your pass, the names of the crew light up and you see your position. No one [had] even told me,” she told the AP.
A spokesperson for Aeroflot didn’t take the lawsuit seriously, saying it was “a routine employee vs. employer dispute that has been deliberately inflated to the scale of a public campaign aimed at tarnishing the airline’s reputation.”

Once again, there were no winning tickets for Saturday night’s Powerball drawing. With the lottery prize standing at an estimated $650 million, this jackpot could go down as the biggest prize in American lottery history.
The drawing for this week’s Powerball jackpot will happen Wednesday at 10:59 p.m. EST, according to the Multi-State Lottery Association. Ticket holders will be able to tune into local stations to watch the drawing live.
The winning Powerball numbers called on Saturday were 17, 19, 39, 43, 68 and the Powerball number was 13. Since no one claimed the winning ticket Saturday, the jackpot has increased from $535 million. The pot has been growing since June 10, after 21 consecutive failed draws. 
The #Powerball jackpot has swelled to an incredible $650 million for the Wednesday August 23rd drawing. Learn more: https://t.co/QY76RGHfdl pic.twitter.com/mXDAAQRrxb
&mdash; Powerball USA (@PowerballUSA) August 21, 2017
The current jackpot ranked as the third largest U.S. lottery to date. The nation’s biggest pot totaled $1.6 billion in 2016, and three different ticket holders claimed the prize.
Winners can opt to receive their massive win fall a few different ways: through an annuity to be paid out over a 29-year span, or in a lump-sum. Either way, the winner gets charged taxes on their win fall.
If a winner opted to receive the lump sum, they'd gross $411.7 million. The federal government would claim 25 percent of the jackpot (foreigners get taxed 30 percent), which would leave the winner with either a one-time payment of $308.8 million or $16.25 million annually, according to USA Mega, a site that monitors Powerball statistics.
There has been a total of four Powerball winners in 2017, two of whom opted to remain anonymous. California resident Jeff Lindsay claimed the winning power ball ticket June 10 and chose to receive an annuity of $447.8 million, the seventh-largest jackpot in Powerball history.
"We are obviously thrilled with this tremendous stroke of good luck and are still getting our arms around what it means for us," Lindsay told Powerball June 10.
"We are private people and do not want to change who we are or become public figures and ask that people appreciate and respect our privacy," the family told Powerball. "In order to help manage what has already been a somewhat overwhelming process, we have engaged a number of financial, legal and other advisors to guide us and help us make the best decisions possible."
They added, "Once things calm down, we plan on working closely with our team of advisors to determine how to properly manage and invest this newfound wealth to ensure that we can support our family and causes that are important to us for many generations to come."
It’s worth noting that the odds of winning are considered low at 1 in 292 million. In fact, according to the National Weather Service, the chances of getting struck by lightning are considered higher at 1 in 600,000.


Johnson & Johnson lost yet another lawsuit Monday to a woman who claimed prolonged use of Johnson's Baby Powder resulted in her getting ovarian cancer.
The Los Angeles superior court ruled in favor of California resident Eva Echeverria, and ordered the company to pay $70 million in compensatory damages and $347 million in punitive damages.
The alleged cancer risks linked to its talc-based products have embroiled the company in over 4,800 similar claims in the United States, Fortune reported.
In 2016, Johnson & Johnson lost three lawsuits over claims its talc products caused ovarian cancer in women.
Echeverria’s lawyers argued that Johnson & Johnson deliberately refrained from putting up a warning label on their products regarding the harmful effects of its talcum powder on ovaries, and instead continued to encourage women to use it for their personal hygiene.
The results of several studies to determine if talcum powder can cause ovarian cancer have been inconclusive.
Most of these studies focused on whether the chance of a woman getting ovarian cancer increased if particles of talcum or baby powder traveled through the vagina, uterus, and fallopian tubes to the ovary via sanitary napkins, diaphragms, condoms or direct application, American Cancer Society reported.

While the International Agency for Research on Cancer, which is a part of the World Health Organization, has stated that talcum powders containing asbestos (a substance that was earlier used in talcum powders but has been banned since 1970s in the U.S.) is “possibly carcinogenic to humans; the National Toxicology Program, formed by  collaboration of governmental agencies such as the National Institutes of Health, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Food and Drug Administration has not fully reviewed talc (with or without asbestos) as a possible carcinogen.
There is also a good explanation why medical experts have failed to make a decision on whether talcum powder can be linked to ovarian cancer, despite a vast number of studies conducted on the same.
“Several studies have suggested that using talcum powder increases the risk of ovarian cancer by 30 to 60 per cent. However, these studies interviewed women who already had ovarian cancer and asked them to remember whether they used talcum powder a long time ago. Their memories might not have been accurate, and they might have mistakenly thought they used more talc than they did in an effort to explain their cancer,” states an article on iHeard, a site run by Cancer Council Australia.
However, a study conducted in May 2016 by National Center for Biotechnology Information, found that 63 percent of the women who participated in the study (2,041 cases with epithelial ovarian cancer and 2,100 age-and-residence-matched controls) had sprayed themselves with talcum powder. They also admitted that the more popular choice when it came to using talcum powder for personal hygiene was Johnson & Johnson Baby Powder.
In the 1990s, Johnson & Johnson started targeting women belonging to minority groups as users of its baby powder. The company’s marketing slogan at the time — “A sprinkle a day keeps odor away” — revolutionized the uses of baby powder.
As a result, studies indicate that a higher percentage of African American women (44 percent) use talcum powder for feminine hygiene than either white (30 percent) or Hispanic (29 percent) women, Consumer Safety reported.
However, Johnson & Johnson has maintained that its products have been scientifically proven to not be carcinogenic in nature.
"We will appeal today's verdict because we are guided by the science, which supports the safety of Johnson's Baby Powder," the company said after the California jury gave its verdict.
 


A Russian flight attendant is suing for discrimination after she claimed she was given less prestigious job opportunities at Russia’s top airline Aeroflot because of her looks, the Associated Press reported Monday. Yevgeniya Magurina joked about the fact she was in the “old, fat and ugly” group, but was serious about not getting to work on international flights because of her physical appearance. Two other women took Aeroflot took court, too.
“Right now there’s a policy that a flight attendant has to be sexually attractive,” Magurina told the AP. “But our role onboard is different: it’s to ensure safety, not to be an object of sexual desire. This is wrong and hurtful.”
The first hint Magurina, 42, got from Aeroflot that she wasn’t “fit” for her job was when she tried to get a new uniform last year. They didn’t carry her size anymore, a Russia size 48, which translates to a size 10 in U.S. clothes. While a size 48 fits Magurina in the waist, it does not in the bust. Before, she would just order a size lager and get it tailored.
Next, any flight attendant who wanted to a chance to staff a “special business class crew” had to be weighed and photographed.

Ultimately, Magurina, who previously held a title of a senior attendant, was downgraded to a lower-ranking role. She wasn’t briefed about the demotion. Instead, she found out at the airport when she was getting ready for one of her flights. “You scan your pass, the names of the crew light up and you see your position. No one [had] even told me,” she told the AP.
Magurina argued the only reason she was demoted was because of her age and physical appearance. “No one cares about professionalism — you have to be young, slim and pretty,” she said.
Aeroflot didn’t take Magurina’s accusations seriously, saying the lawsuit was “a routine employee vs. employer dispute that has been deliberately inflated to the scale of a public campaign aimed at tarnishing the airline’s reputation,” Vladimir Alexandrov, the company’s deputy CEO for legal matters, told the AP.
When the publication asked Alexandrov why they did not carry larger sizes, he argued a flight attendants job is “physically and psychologically demanding” and added Aeroflot does not reveal their “internal rules and regulations.”
Local courts were also dismiss missive of the flight attendant’s suit. Russia’s higher court will reportedly make a ruling on the case Tuesday.
It wasn’t that long ago the U.S. held unfair physical standards, too.The ideal flight attendant was described as “petite; weight 100 to 118 pounds; height 5 feet to 5 feet 4 inches; age 20 to 26 years,” according to a New York Times article in 1936. This rule remained steadfast until the 1970s and the weight requirement wasn’t officially dropped until the 1990s. 
American Airlines suggested their flight attendants maintain a “fresh appearance” in the section titled “Female Uniform” of their September 2011 “Flight Attendant Image Standards.” The airline said, “makeup should be freshened as necessary, but never in view of the customer.”

President’s Donald Trump’s large family and multiple residences are reportedly responsible for depleting funds necessary to pay “hundreds of agents” needed to protect the family and the properties. Secret Service Director Randolph “Tex” Alles said there’s nothing to be done about the high cost of maintaining the Trump family’s security, as the Secret Service’s “responsibility is required in law.”
USA Today  broke the story in a report published Monday that said “more than 1,000 agents have already hit the federally mandated caps for salary and overtime allowances that were meant to last the entire year.” The report pointed to Trump’s frequent weekend travels to his respective East Coast properties — as well as the travel expenses of his adult children for business — as the reason for the depletion of Secret Service.
Speaking with USA Today, Alles revealed an unusually high number of White House associates in Trump’s orbit who require protection — up 31 from the Obama administration. According to Alles, Trump requires security for 42 people, with 18 of those individuals being members of his family.
“The president has a large family, and our responsibility is required in law,” Alles told USA Today. “I can't change that. I have no flexibility.”
The report noted that agents are being overworked and are required to travel constantly, and Alles said that the conditions have led to departures in the Secret Service ranks. But back pay for their work may not be possible even with congressional approval for additional funding. Per the report:
“The compensation crunch is so serious that the director has begun discussions with key lawmakers to raise the combined salary and overtime cap for agents, from $160,000 per year to $187,000 for at least the duration of Trump's first term.
“But even if such a proposal was approved, about 130 veteran agents would not be fully compensated for hundreds of hours already amassed, according to the agency.”
Trump’s frequent trips to his properties were previously revealed to be  extremely costly, and the administration has been cagey about whether such trips are intended for government business or for leisure.
A  report from Politico earlier this year found that the president’s trips to his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida cost taxpayers around $3 million per trip. To date, the president has taken seven trips to the Palm Beach property since his inauguration. USA Today reported the Secret Service has been required to pay $60,000 on renting golf carts at both properties to protect the president.
According to  Is Trump At Mar-a-Lago? — a website from the Center for American Progress Action Fund — the president is estimated to have cost taxpayers $32 million in trips to Mar-a-Lago and Bedminster alone.
The Secret Service has nearly reached its limit for the entire year protecting the president and his associates.

An American Airlines passenger left the airport in handcuffs Saturday after he tried to open the plane’s door while it was still descending, CBS-affiliate WCCO-TV reported the following day. The plane was flying from Los Angeles to Minneapolis.
Click here to watch the “crazy” video.
The incident was caught on a cell phone video, thanks to passenger Richard Munassi. He whipped out his mobile device when he heard the unruly passenger cause a commotion.
At first, Munassi thought the incident was a fight between two passengers. “There was a lot of yelling and screaming. I thought perhaps two of the passengers had gotten into maybe a fist fight,” he told WCCO.
It wasn’t long until he realized a passenger was trying to open the exit door while the plane was descending. “It wasn't immediately after (the pilot) letting us know that we were in descent. It was a couple of minutes afterward, so he had a plan to open that door as we were getting close to the ground,” Munassi said.

A different passenger, Salman Elmi, said he heard someone threaten physical harm against the man trying to open the door. “It was a crazy experience,” Elmi told WCCO. “I just hear shouting, ‘I'm about to punch him.’”
It’s unclear how flight attendants were able to calm the irate man down, but WCCO noted they “subdued” him. When the plane finally landed, it was rough.
“We came in hot, probably the hottest landing I've ever been on and I fly all the time,” Munassi recalled. “Everyone was dead quiet on the flight. You could cut the tension with a knife.”
The man who tried to open the door was not identified. In the video, he can be shown wearing sunglasses. He was escorted off the plane by police officers and reportedly didn’t show any emotion. He didn’t resist arrest and went with them calmly. He didn’t say a word, either.
Elmi and Munassi agreed American Airlines handled the incident well. “I think American Airlines did a great job, especially the pilot of the plane kind of keeping everything in order and keeping everyone calm,” said Munassi.
A frequent flyer, Munassi is not afraid to fly with American Airlines again. “Honestly, I'm just happy that I'm here today and nothing happened to our flight and I'm happy to be here,” he said.
The incident will be investigated by the FBI since it occurred in the air, a Minneapolis−Saint Paul International Airport (MSP) spokesperson told WCCO.
American Airlines did not provide additional information when asked for comment. “You will have to contact the FBI for additional details,” they said in statement through email to International Business Times Monday. The FBI did not immediately respond to IBT for a comment.

A man who forked over more than $1,000 for what should have been a comfortable flight from London to South America said, instead, he was forced to sit in a puddle of urine for 11 hours. Andrew Wilkinson, 39, said he noticed the stain and the unmistakable smell as soon as he sat down.
"I got to my seat and saw that there was a wet patch," he told Britain's LAD Bible in a story published Monday. "It was about the size of two decks of cards laid side by side. At first, I thought it was water but the smell was so distinct it could only have been urine."
Wilkinson said when he initially alerted a crew member to the stain, he was given wipes to clean it himself. He ended up sitting on a blanket for much of the flight. When he needed a fresh blanket to put beneath him, he said, the flight attendant was unhelpful in finding him a new one. Wilkinson also requested that his seat be moved.
"I was in economy and it was full but they could have bumped someone up from business to first class and freed up a seat that way," he told LAD Bible. "I said to the stewardess, 'You're obviously going to move me into business, aren't you? I can't really sit here.'"
Wilkinson's request was ultimately denied and he was stranded in the seat for the remainder of the flight. A photograph shared by Wilkinson showed the visible yellow spot on the plane's gray seat.
"She said she would see what she would do but I wasn't moved. And then she commented, 'You are going to work me hard on this flight, aren't you?'" he recalled. "So, I was left to sit in a urine-soaked seat for over 11 hours when I paid £1,242 for a return fight with BA [British Airways]." 
Wilkinson took his formal complaint to British Airways and said he was unsatisfied with their response.
"I was given 5,000 Avios points," he said. "I just do not think that is good enough compensation for sitting in someone else's wee for over 11 hours."
The points awarded to Wilkinson are only enough for a one-way flight to Paris, according to LAD Bible.
"We were very concerned to hear about this and have been in touch with our customer to apologize and make amends," British Airways told International Business Times in a statement Monday. "The cleanliness of our aircraft is of the utmost importance to us and our planes are cleaned thoroughly after every flight. We also perform frequent spot checks to make sure our cleaners are maintaining our high standards."

An Uber driver from Chicago was held on $100,000 bail Saturday over demanding sex from a 19-year-old girl after locking her inside the cab.
Muhammad Fahim, 44, was charged with three counts of unlawful restraint for the incident that happened July 14. After the teenage girl was picked up by Fahim, the passenger found the details of her logged request had somehow been deleted.
When the teen offered to pay her driver in cash, Fahim pressured her to have sex with him. When the passenger refused, Fahim refused to let her off his cab, repeatedly locking the doors, and driving around. The teenager jumped out of the moving cab, when the cab driver slowed down the car at one point, according to the assistant state's attorney Mikah Soliunas, Chicago Tribune reported. It was not clear, however, if the teen got hurt after jumping off the cab. 
Uber spokesman confirmed to the Tribune that Fahim was removed as a driver. He also said the incident was “troubling.”

However, Uber was prompted to take the action more than a month after the incident. Law enforcement officers tracked the driver’s name to the incident when they stopped his vehicle for a traffic violation at the 500 block of North Dearborn Street, Chicago, on Thursday and ran a background check.
This is by no means the first incident of indecent behavior by an Uber driver that has made the headlines. In a similar incident, a woman living in the East Village neighborhood of New York accused her Uber driver of raping her after she fell asleep in the cab on Aug. 17.
The 47-year-old driver allegedly took the 31-year-old woman back to his apartment and sexually molested her after the latter passed out in his cab. When she woke up and realized that she was not in her apartment, she confronted the driver. According to Tribune Media affiliate New York's Pix 11, the driver simply said, "I used protection — please don't call the police.”
Earlier this month, Inspector Neil Billany, head of Metropolitan Police’s taxi and private hire team in the United Kingdom wrote a warning letter to Uber, accusing it of putting the reputation of its brand before the safety of its passengers. Among the cases cited by Billany’s letter was an instance where an Uber driver was allowed to retain his job even after an allegation of sexual assault against him.
As a result, the driver ended up committing a “more serious” act of sexual stack on a woman passenger later on. In another instance, a driver used pepper spray that he was carrying during a road-rage argument. “Firstly it seems they are deciding what to report (less serious matters/less damaging to reputation over serious offenses) and secondly by not reporting to police promptly they are allowing situations to develop that clearly affect the safety and security of the public,” Billany wrote in his letter, according to a report published by Fortune.
Uber has since denied the allegations made by the police. Uber's General Manager for London Tom Elvidge said in a blog post: "Uber does not routinely report incidents retrospectively to the police on behalf of others  — we advise those involved to make a report themselves and then assist the police with any subsequent inquiries."
"We believe the choice of whether or not to make a police report should sit with the reporter/victim,” Elvidge said. "We understand that there could be all sorts of reasons why they may or may not wish to report the incident to the police and have worked closely with women’s advocacy groups on this issue.”


Tech companies have rallied together to take stringent action against white supremacist groups in the wake of the Charlottesville violence that left a woman dead.
While Facebook has taken down the “Unite The Right” page, Google and GoDaddy have de-registered the domain of the racist site Daily Stormer.  
Even Apple got into the act, cutting Apple Pay support for websites that sell white supremacist merchandize. Apple CEO Tim Cook even publicly voiced his disagreement with President Donald Trump’s ambivalent stand of assigning blame to both sides.
“I disagree with the president and others who believe that there is a moral equivalence between white supremacists and Nazis, and those who oppose them by standing up for human rights,” Cook wrote in an open letter.
But this is not the first time tech companies have stood up against what we can call cyber evils — the use of technology for nefarious purposes.
There have been many examples in the past. For example, cyber bullying has been a concern for far too long. But the incidents have failed to stop — just  this February teenager Mallory Grossman killed herself because of cyber bullying.
A bigger threat emerged with the rise of the Islamic State group (ISIS), which used technology and social media not only to publicize itself, but also to spread fear and target victims.
Yet, in 2017, we are still debating whether a Facebook post of an ISIS image is legal.
The fact remains that despite tech companies being proactive recently, it is quite easy to find racist content online. This content generally violates many social networks and tech companies’ terms of usage, but it still exists online and is quite easy to find.
According a survey done by the Pew Research Center, 60 percent of users have been called offensive names online, while 25 percent have seen someone being physically threatened. In addition to this, 24 percent have witnessed someone being harassed for a sustained period of time.
White supremacist memes and even comments, like the one by a Massachusetts police officer attacking the victims, are widely available. The truth is, although tech companies have begun cracking down on such content, they are already fighting a losing battle.
With the massive amounts of data that social networks, for example, receive, it is almost impossible to monitor content spewing hate and inciting violence. Facebook, for example, has close to 2 billion monthly users, while YouTube has 1.5 billion. Even if these users post status updates and comments on videos just once a day, that would still mean Facebook deals with 24 billion posts in an year, while YouTube will have 18 billion comments to filter. While that is a lot, the actual number is much bigger. 
Even if social networks and tech companies like Apple were hypothetically able to monitor all such content, there is the concern about freedom of speech and censorship. Social networks are generally expected to be free spaces with a high level of freedom of expression.
“If an internet service provider wants to deny me the opportunity to read offensive speech like the Daily Stormer, that’s a problem," said Nate Cardozo, senior staff attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. "There doesn’t seem to be any suggestion the Daily Stormer was hosting illegal content, just terrible content. We should be able to see it and reject it."
If tech companies were going to bring down a heavy hand on such content, they would probably use bots for such a purpose. The problem with bots or any other supervisory mechanism is that they won’t be able to differentiate between posts condemning an act or even a satire.
But with the violence and deaths, pressure is mounting on tech companies. Germany, in April, proposed a 50 million euros fine on tech firms offering a platform for cyber hate, while a group that fights against cyber hate, the Anti-defamation League, has proposed setting up its center in Silicon Valley.
Many organizations believe that the current crackdown might not be enough as such offensive content will surface again, in a different form, as has happened before. The Daily Stormer, for example, has tried to make a comeback with a Russian domain, which was then shut down. But it can still come back.
“Racism and bigotry will not be eradicated if we merely force them underground,” said Anthony Romero of the American Civil Liberties Union. And that is the challenge that the tech industry faces, and it seems to have no viable answers.
While the companies definitely need to stop the flow of hate, there seems no technology or paradigm available for them to do it without raising fears of censorship or issues of proper monitoring. 
It is a problem they will continue to grapple with, till the next Charlottesville.


A couple aboard a Southwest Airlines flight who engaged in a sexual act mid-flight was questioned by local authorities upon landing but will not face charges, according to reports. The airline told International Business Times that the incident occurred on a Saturday flight from Atlanta to Las Vegas and apologized to other passengers aboard the flight.
“On Saturday, two passengers traveling on Southwest flight 3246 from Atlanta to Las Vegas were engaged in inappropriate activity,” Southwest Airlines told IBT by email. “Our Crew became aware of the situation and approached the Customers to address the behavior. The situation escalated and the Crew contacted local authorities to meet the flight.”
The two individuals, who were not identified in reports, were reportedly told to refrain from sexual activity aboard the flight but continued to engage in the behavior, Fox-affiliate KVVU reported Saturday. Shortly after the plane landed around 8 a.m. Saturday morning, the couple was questioned by the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police. 
“Upon arrival into Las Vegas, local law enforcement questioned the passengers involved,” the airline told IBT. “Southwest does not condone this type of behavior and we apologize to the other passengers onboard who were potentially exposed to this activity.”
KVVU reported that neither a complaint was filed nor were any arrests made. The episode will be forwarded to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and FBI, which handles crimes committed in the United States airspace.
“Nobody on the flight wanted to file charges,” said Lt. John Liberty, watch commander for the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department, according to NBC-affiliate KSNV. “The flight crew left and did not even file a statement so we have nothing to charge them with. They were identified and all the information will be turned over to the FBI.”
“The reports are they were involved on the flight and were asked to stop and they just couldn't control themselves,” Michael Oram, McCarran International Airport spokesman, told KSNV before the plane landed.
Oram said no video of the incident surfaced on social media. It was not clear Sunday where on the plane the act occurred or specifically what it entailed, but Oram told KVVU that the two individuals “were all over each other.”
Earlier this year, a video of two adults who engaged in a similar stunt went viral. The incident occurred aboard a Ryanair flight from Manchester to Ibiza, and a woman could be seen in the video straddling a man who was later revealed to be a stranger she met the same day. The woman later said that the viral incident — which a friend described as a “lapdance” — left her “mortified.” The airline said at the time that an investigation was underway.
“We are looking into this matter,” Ryanair said in a statement after the video surfaced online. “We will not tolerate unruly, disruptive or inappropriate behaviour at any time and any passengers who appear to behave in an unacceptable manner may be liable for further sanctions.”

The auto industry seems to be ready for disruption. It is an industry that has functioned largely without changes for the past hundred years, but with the emergence of technologies such as artificial intelligence, self-driving and robotics, the basic paradigm of the industry is expected to change.
Robotics, for example, has been used for a long time in the auto industry, but not at the rate that it are being applied currently. Tesla, the biggest disruptor in the automotive industry, has set the trend for increasingly robot-run factories.
The Tesla Gigafactory 1 is located at a site which was previously a General Motors automotive factory that employed more than 50,000 people. In contrast, the Gigafactory 1 employs just 10,000 people and uses robots and automation to make its cars, such as the newly launched Model 3. The company employs robots such as the self-navigating Autonomous Indoor Vehicles (AIVs).

It also uses a lot of Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs) which are used for transporting equipment from one section to the other.
The car assembly is done with the help of robotic arms instead of by tool-wielding humans.

While the Tesla Gigafactory 1 is just one of many examples of auto companies increasingly employing robots in production, it is the strongest indication that as the auto industry moves toward automation and robotics, human employment in the industry is set to decrease. In other words, the auto industry will not be a large scale employer and as the industry progresses and competition with brands such as Tesla rises, companies will increasingly opt for robot-run factories like the Gigafactory 1.
Artificial intelligence (AI) will also play a large part in the future of the automotive industry. According to the Information Handling Services (IHS) Technology's Automotive Electronics Roadmap Report, the use of AI based driver-assistance systems in vehicles is set to jump from 7 million a couple of years ago to 122 million by 2025.
"An artificial-intelligence system continuously learns from experience and by its ability to discern and recognize its surroundings. It learns as human beings do, from real sounds, images and other sensory inputs. The system recognizes the car's environment and evaluates the contextual implications for the moving car," said Luca De Ambroggi, IHS Technology's principal analyst for automotive semiconductors, according to a report by Computerworld.
AI-based systems are set to become basic systems for vehicles and in combination with technologies such as speech recognition, gesture recognition, eye tracking, driver monitoring and virtual assistance, these systems are expected to make driving safer and also more automated.
Since cars are increasingly expected to be equipped with hardware such as camera-based machine units, radar-detection units and driver evaluation units, AI will serve as the connecting interface between the regular car machinery and such hardware — e.g., advance brake warnings using object detection feedback from the onboard cameras.
This technology is expected to change the way we drive. According to Gartner, there will be 250 million connected vehicles on the roads by 2020, which will be using AI in some way or other.
Self-driving, a technology which is still not mainstream and yet has major auto and tech players investing in it, is set to change the auto industry in the biggest of ways. With many car makers aiming to achieve full autonomy by 2021, the end of driving as we know it might be near.
With cars such as the Tesla Model 3 equipped with semi-autonomous features, which let the car be driven using automation on highways, the move toward the end of human driving seems to have begun.
Apart from taking over control from human drivers, self-driving has the potential of changing the notion of car ownership as it stands. Currently, you buy a car and drive it yourself or hail a cab.
The problem with lending out cars is, in some ways, due to the inconsistency of human driving. Once driving becomes safer, thanks to a universal standard of safety followed by self-driven cars, this might not be an issue.
Think about a world in which driving is no longer necessary. Since the cars will be driven via automation, chances are that people might actually lend their cars out when they are not using them. These cars could be used by ride-hailing services such as Uber and returned to the owner at the time of his/her usage.
Another paradigm is that since self-driven cars would be available 24 hours, a person could simply order a car to his/her door rather than keep one in the driveway. Automotive transport could transform into a utility like electricity or water supply.
According to the MIT's Milken Institute’s AgeLab, “When the brightest-eyed autonomous vehicle advocates talk about self-driving cars transforming society as we know it, what they’re imagining, first and foremost, is the death of car ownership.”


President Donald Trump has mostly surrounded himself with advisors and a Cabinet who boast billions in personal wealth. On Friday, perhaps lost amid the high-profile exit of chief strategist Steve Bannon, financier Carl Icahn, the wealthiest of Trump's circle, announced he would no longer serve as a special advisor on financial regulation after criticism from biofuel advocates and Democratic lawmakers claimed his policy recommendations could help his own investments.
In a letter to Trump on his personal website, Icahn, an 81-year-old corporate raider with a net worth of roughly $16 billion, denied any conflict of interest with his businesses, claiming he "never had access to nonpublic information or profited" from his position after accusations from several Democratic lawmakers, who claim he pushed for changes in biofuel policy for his “own personal gain.” He also claimed he was resigning to avoid "partisan bickering."
"I never had a formal position with your administration nor a policymaking role," read the letter to Trump. "And contrary to the insinuations of a handful of your Democratic critics, I never had access to nonpublic information or profited from my position, nor do I believe that my role presented conflicts of interest. Indeed, out of an abundance of caution, the only issues I ever discussed with you were broad matters of policy affecting the refining industry. I never sought any special benefit for any company with which I have been involved, and have only expressed views that I believed would benefit the refining industry as a whole."
Icahn stepped down before the New Yorker published a report Friday by Patrick Radden Keefe that cited Bush administration ethics lawyer Richard Painter's claim that Icahn could be in "legal jeopardy" and that he is "walking right into possible criminal charges" for pressuring the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to change federal regulations that affect oil refiner CVR Energy. Icahn reportedly holds an 82-percent stake in the Sugar Land, Texas-based company, acquiring a controlling interest in 2012.
The federal regulations stem from Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), a law signed in 2005 requiring transportation fuel to contain a minimum volume of renewable fuels. According to the New Yorker report, when the price of Renew Identification Numbers (RIN) began fluctuating in 2013, CVR Energy was spending over $200 million a year on credits.
In March, the New York Times reported that Icahn had discussed ethanol rules with Scott Pruitt prior to Pruitt becoming head of the EPA. Icahn also spoke with Trump and his top economic advisor, Gary Cohn, about ethanol.
As a candidate in the 2016 Presidential Election, Trump had said he would nominate Icahn for secretary of the treasury. The position ultimately went to banker Steve Mnuchin, who is reportedly worth $300 million.
Phone calls to CVR by International Business Times on Saturday were not answered.


A woman and her 70-year-old father who were en route to visit an ailing relative Wednesday were reportedly kicked off a Frontier Airlines flight after the two expressed their dissatisfaction with the airline during a private conversation. While the Orlando family maintains they did nothing wrong, the airline claims they were using profanities while talking about flight crew. The airline told International Business Times that an investigation is still underway.
Whitney Miller, 25, and her father, Eric Miller, were discussing how “miserable” they were traveling with the budget carrier but were unaware that a flight attendant behind them was listening to their conversation, local news station  WKMG, a CBS affiliate, reported Wednesday. The Millers allege that the flight attendant approached other flight crew who then aggressively asked the family if there was an issue.
“They would lean over the back of the chair in front of us, get their face right up to here and they would simply ask, ‘Do we have a problem?’” Eric Miller told WKMG.
“It was, ‘No, do you have a problem? Do you want to be removed from the aircraft?’” Whitney Miller said. “We responded, ‘No.’ We didn't know what was going on, what's happening. Please tell us what's happening.”
In a phone interview, Frontier Airlines representative Richard Oliver told IBT that the situation escalated after the family was approached about their comments, which were overheard by the flight’s crew. At that time, Oliver said, the Millers used language to refer to flight attendants that included “stupid,” “rude,” and “b-----.”
The Millers were asked to leave shortly thereafter. Frontier Airlines refunded their tickets, and the family is now reportedly planning to drive to their location. The airline told IBT that its account of the incident was corroborated by interviews with several flight attendants and a pilot seated nearby in the cabin.

A video recording caught the few moments after the altercation as the family was being escorted off of the plane. Interviewed by WKMG, the woman who filmed the clip claimed she neither knew the family nor heard the Millers say anything inappropriate. The unnamed woman did, however, claim that the flight attendant was eavesdropping on their conversation.
According to the passenger who recorded the video, clapping heard while the Millers were being escorted off the plane was in support of the family. The airline, however, told IBT that other passengers heard in the video were clapping because the altercation had been diffused and the flight could finally depart.
“Our Flight Attendants are customer service and safety professionals who are trained to recognize situations that may impact comfort and safety of passengers and crew onboard our aircraft,” the airline said in a statement. “The behaviors and comments exhibited by these passengers prior to departure were inappropriate; and as a result they were asked to leave our aircraft. Safety and security of our passengers and crew is our number one priority.”
Frontier Airlines has been one of few carriers that have managed to skirt negative press currently dogging the airline industry. In the last week alone, JetBlue has seen  several incidents of crew aboard its flight falling ill as the result of mysterious odors. A  16-year-old girl spoke about being sexually assaulted during a United Airlines flight after which her alleged assaulter walked free. And earlier this week, two planes — Delta Air Lines and American Airlines aircraft —  collided on the tarmac at New York’s John F. Kennedy Airport, causing both damage and delays.

Amid growing tensions following a “Unite the Right” rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, that saw white supremacists, neo-Nazis and members of the Ku Klux Klan, several technology companies have announced bans on members of the respective hate groups. The bans come on the heels of President Donald Trump condemning “both sides” and the “alt-left” after a woman was left dead and several more injured by a man who rammed his car into a group of counter-protesters at the rally.
For several companies, the fallout and outrage over the weekend’s events prompted corporate decisions to oust any employees or clients who used the respective products. The list of companies that have taken action is growing.
Apple
Apple CEO Tim Cook this week pledged $1 million in donations to the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) and the Anti-Defamation League, and Apple pledged to match two-for-one employee donations to human rights groups the end of September, the  Guardian reported Thursday.
"We must not witness or permit such hate and bigotry in our country, and we must be unequivocal about it," Cook wrote in a memo to his staff this week. "This is not about the left or the right, conservative or liberal. It is about human decency and morality."
He added, "I disagree with the president and others who believe that there is a moral equivalence between white supremacists and Nazis, and those who oppose them by standing up for human rights. Equating the two runs counter to our ideals as Americans."
Cloudflare
Internet security startup Cloudflare announced Wednesday that it had terminated the account of the Daily Stormer, an online hub for content espousing white supremacy and neo-Nazism. The same day the company’s co-founder and CEO Matthew Prince  wrote a blog post explaining the decision to cease “proxying the site’s traffic” and “answering DNS requests for their sites.”
“The tipping point for us making this decision was that the team behind Daily Stormer made the claim that we were secretly supporters of their ideology,” Prince wrote.
“Our team has been thorough and have had thoughtful discussions for years about what the right policy was on censoring,” he continued. “Like a lot of people, we’ve felt angry at these hateful people for a long time but we have followed the law and remained content neutral as a network. We could not remain neutral after these claims of secret support by Cloudflare.”
Facebook
On Wednesday, Facebook banned both the Facebook and Instagram accounts of a white nationalist who was part of a Vice News documentary that premiered Monday on the Charlottesville rally. A Facebook spokesperson confirmed to the Associated Press the same day that accounts managed by Christopher Cantwell were removed.
In addition to using language that disparaged minority groups, Cantwell said the death of Heather Heyer — the woman killed at the “United the Right” rally — was “justified.”
“I'm not even saying we're nonviolent,” he said. “I'm saying that f—ing we did not aggress. We did not initiate force against anybody. We're not nonviolent — we'll f—ing kill these people if we have to.”
Cantwell was later seen  openly weeping Wednesday in a video posted to YouTube after he learned there was a warrant out for his arrest.
GoDaddy
The Daily Stormer, which used its platform to promote Saturday’s rally in Virgina, was banned by GoDaddy’s site Sunday. GoDaddy, a web domain registrar, hosted the Daily Stormer’s domain until public outcry about events that unfolded over the weekend seemingly forced the server’s hand.
We informed The Daily Stormer that they have 24 hours to move the domain to another provider, as they have violated our terms of service.
&mdash; GoDaddy (@GoDaddy) August 14, 2017

“We informed The Daily Stormer that they have 24 hours to move the domain to another provider, as they have violated our terms of service,” the  GoDaddy wrote in a tweet Sunday.
Google
After the Daily Stormer was barred from its GoDaddy domain, the site temporarily moved to a Google domain — but not for long.
Reached for comment, the tech giant on Monday  told NPR: “We are cancelling Daily Stormer's registration with Google Domains for violating our terms of service.”
Tech companies “certainly have the right to make their own judgments about what’s in the terms of service and whether it’s being violated,” said Mike Yang, former general counsel at Pinterest Inc. and a former deputy general counsel at Google.
Business Insider reported Monday that per a source close to Google, the company did not want its platform used to incite violence.
OkCupid
Facebook was not the only tech site to ban Cantwell following his controversial appearance in Vice’s Charlottesville documentary. Upon learning that the white supremacist had an account on its server, dating website OkCupid also banned Cantwell.
We were alerted that white supremacist Chris Cantwell was on OkCupid. Within 10 minutes we banned him for life.
&mdash; OkCupid (@okcupid) August 17, 2017

“We were alerted that white supremacist Chris Cantwell was on OkCupid,” the  site tweeted Thursday. “Within 10 minutes we banned him for life.”
Spotify
The music-streaming service Spotify this week also announced it was working to remove accounts and music on its site linked to hate group. After Digital Music News on Monday published an aggregated list of white supremacist bands that used the service, Spotify quickly issued a ban.
“Spotify takes immediate action to remove any such material as soon as it has been brought to our attention,” the  company said in a statement. “We are glad to have been alerted to this content — and have already removed many of the bands identified today, while urgently reviewing the remainder.”
Twitter
On the heels of announcements of permanent bans of the Daily Stormer by Google and GoDaddy, Twitter too announced that it had suspended accounts linked to the white supremacist hub,  Reuters reported Wednesday.
“We may suspend an account if it has been reported to us as violating our Rules surrounding abuse,” the  Twitter notes on its support page. “When an account engages in abusive behavior, like sending threats to others or impersonating other accounts, we may suspend it temporarily or, in some cases, permanently.”
Uber Technologies
Ride-share company Uber sent a memo internally to both its drivers and employees Thursday that stated that there was “simply no place for this type of bigotry, discrimination, and hate.” The memo specifically addressed Saturday’s rally and noted that the company would “act swiftly and decisively to uphold our Community Guidelines, including our policy against discrimination of any kind — this includes banning people from the app.”

“Now more than ever we must stand together against hatred and violence,” the company added. “Thank you for making our community one that we can all be proud of.”

A class action lawsuit filed against Nestlé Waters North America, Inc. Tuesday claimed Poland Spring Bottled Water is “a colossal fraud.”
Eleven bottled water drinkers accused Poland Spring of a “colossal fraud perpetrated against American consumers.” They filed the 325-page lawsuit in a Connecticut federal court. According to the suit, 11 individuals spent thousands of dollars on Poland Spring in the past few years and are seeking $5 million in damages for a national class.
The suit alleged Poland Spring’s parent company Nestle bottles groundwater and claims it is spring water. The claims questioned whether Poland Spring water sources met the Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) definition of a spring.

The FDA defined spring water as water “collected only at the spring or through a bore hole tapping the underground formation feeding the spring.” According to the suit, Nestle obtains Poland Spring water from some sites that are “phony” or “man-made” and do not meet the FDA’s qualifications to be a spring.
The bottled water drinkers said the spring in Poland Spring, Maine, has been dry for almost 50 years. The lawsuit claimed Poland Spring water sources in Hollis, Fryeburg, Denmark, Dallas Plantation, Pierce Pond Township and Kingfield may not be legitimate either.
“For more than twenty years, Nestle Waters’ marketing and sales of Poland Spring Water has been a colossal fraud perpetrated against American consumers. To consumers, ‘spring water’ from a naturally occurring spring signifies purity and high quality and commands a premium price compared to Defendant’s non-spring drinking water products or filtered tap water,” the lawsuit said.
“To illicitly capture that premium, Defendant, since it began selling the Poland Spring brand in 1993, has bottled common groundwater and illegally mislabeled it as ‘100 percent Natural Spring Water,’” it added.
“The claims made in the lawsuit are without merit and an obvious attempt to manipulate the legal system for personal gain,” a Nestle Waters North America statement said. “It meets the U.S. Food and Drug Administration regulations defining spring water, all state regulations governing spring classification for standards of identity, as well as all federal and state regulations governing spring water collection, good manufacturing practices, product quality and labeling.”
This is not the first time Poland Spring faced legal action regarding its quality of water. The company settled a class action lawsuit in 2003 that alleged Poland Spring Water does not come from a spring. The company did not agree with the claims but paid $10 million in discounts and contributions to charity.


JetBlue Airways said Thursday that two of its crew members fell ill aboard a Wednesday night flight from Boston to Charleston, South Carolina. According to the airline, the cause of the odor was nail polish. A representative for the budget carrier confirmed the incident to International Business Times in a statement.
“The crew on JetBlue flight 1667 reported an odor in the cabin,” the airline told IBT. “The aircraft was inspected and the odor was determined to be nail polish remover.”
Airline spokesperson Doug McGraw  told the Associated Press that the employees were told to check-in with medical professionals upon the flight landing in South Carolina. No passengers were affected by the odor during the flight. 
Odors have been a frequent perpetrator named in incidents in which crew or passengers have fallen sick on JetBlue Airways flights. Wednesday’s incident was the third in a string of events involving an odor on its flights in just a week, the AP reported. JetBlue Airways said it installed carbon air filters to reduce odors on its aircraft.
One of the airline’s flights from Boston to San Diego, California, last week was forced to make an emergency landing in Buffalo, New York after crew members fell sick. Two flight attendants and the flight’s pilot were transported to a hospital near the Buffalo-Niagara International Airport,  MassLive.com reported at the time.
“They were saying that there was an incident on the plane where somebody was having a medical issue,” passenger  Michael Feuerstein told Fox-affiliate WFXT in Boston. “People were having headaches on the plane. There were children. The smell could be smelled from the wings of the plane to the actual back of the plane.”
In a separate interview with the Cheektowaga Chronicle,  Feuerstein said upon landing that the firefighters called to the scene “walked on board with a carbon monoxide detector to the very back of the airplane where after that it started beeping, extremely, extremely, rapidly.”
A JetBlue Airways flight from California to Florida earlier this month was diverted to Oklahoma City after a foul odor coming from the cockpit caused five of its 135 passengers to experience trouble breathing, IBT  previously reported. Passengers were reportedly treated with oxygen tanks to stabilize their breathing after eight ambulances arrived on the scene at the Will Rogers World Airport.

A teen girl who was allegedly groped during a United Airlines flight from Seattle to Newark, New Jersey, last month joined her mother in speaking publicly about the incident. The 16-year-old — whose identity along with her mother’s was withheld at their request — said her alleged assaulter robbed her of “peace of mind.”
The girl said she was asleep when a man began touching her during the overnight flight, which she boarded alone July 23. In an  interview with CBS News published Thursday, the girl — who was en route to New Jersey after winning admission to a young women’s leadership academy at Princeton — spoke about her ordeal.
“I could feel his hand on my thigh, and one of his hands had like, came between my legs and he was rubbing in between my legs and then he tried to put his other hand underneath my pants and I kind of woke up and was like ‘What are you doing?’” she said.
As International Business Times previously reported, a federal complaint of the incident stated the man — who was identified by the girl as 28-year-old Vijakumar Krishnappa — removed his hand from the teen’s leg when she woke up. But when she again nodded off, he allegedly “put his hand on her groin and inner thigh, and began rubbing the Victim through her clothing.”
When the teen notified a flight attendant about the incident, she was moved to another row. But the girl told CBS that she felt like “he could see wherever I was sitting.”
Both the girl and her mother said that the teen’s assaulter walked free after deboarding the flight. While the company’s policy requires that the carrier notify the authorities of all incidents of misconduct, United Airlines reportedly breached its protocol in handling the incident. It wasn’t until the girl’s mother notified a United terminal supervisor by phone that the FBI, which handles crimes committed in the United States airspace, became involved and was able to track down the passenger later that day.
Reached for comment by IBT, the carrier did not give a direct response to comments made by the girl and her mother about its handling of the incident.
“The safety and security of our customers is our top priority,” the airline told IBT. “We take these allegations seriously and continue to work closely with the proper authorities as part of their investigation.”
“I literally thought I was going to die,” her mother said. “I'm 3,000 miles away. My child says she's been sexually assaulted and I'm asking her questions and she's like, disoriented, I'm like, ‘Where is he? Do you see him?’ And she said, ‘He just walked by me.’ And I said, ‘Get the police! Get United!’”
“He had no right to touch me. He had no right. I guess I would say he took my peace of mind,” the teen told CBS. “I don't feel safe.”
Krishnappa — who is a doctor visiting the U.S. on a fellowship — is out on bail, according to CBS. If convicted, he could face up to two years in prison and a fine of $250,000 as well as deportation. Krishnappa’s attorney told CBS that he “adamantly denies the charges and deserves to be considered an innocent man.”

A new study from financial information company Sageworks confirmed that accounting-related services are the most profitable job industry. Jobs within this industry include accounting, tax preparation, bookkeeping and payroll services. 
The study evaluated the most profitable industries over a 12-month time span, which included pre-tax net profit margins for privately held companies.
"Not all private companies are necessarily shooting for high profitability," Sageworks Analyst Libby Bierman said in a press release. "Maybe their industry is price sensitive and rely on volume for growth (like grocery stores) or maybe they are sinking profits back into the business for R&D (growth companies)."
Bierman added, "But in most instances, higher profitability is better, and the industries atop this list are getting more from their business investment than others."
Sageworks evaluated specialty services to amass its list of the top 20 profitable industries. Here is the full list of the study's findings:
1. Accounting, Tax Preparation, Bookkeeping, and Payroll Services  — 18.4 percent (Net Profit Margin)2. Lessors of Real Estate  — 17.9 percent3. Legal Services  — 17.4 percent4. Management of Companies and Enterprises  — 16.0 percent5. Activities Related to Real Estate  — 14.9 percent6. Offices of Dentists  — 14.8 percent7. Offices of Real Estate Agents and Brokers  —  14.3 percent8. Nonmetallic Mineral Mining and Quar  —  13.2 percent9. Offices of Other Health Pract  —  13.0 percent10. Religious Organizations  —  12.4 percent11. Medical and Diagnostic Laboratories  — 12.1 percent12. Land Subdivision — 12.1 percent13. Automotive Equipment Rental and Leasing — 12.0 percent14. Warehousing and Storage — 11.0 percent15. Death Care Services — 10.8 percent16. Other Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services — 10.6 percent17. Management, Scientific, and Technical Consulting Services — 10.3 percent18. Specialized Design Services  — 10.2 percent19. Other Schools and Instruction — 9.8 percent20. Support Activities for Road Transportation  — 9.7 percent
Many of the top earners on this year's list are service-related industries that possess particular certification and education requirements upon entry, which is why these industries are permitted to charge customers with a premium fee for its services. These industries — Accounting and Legal Services, etc. — also don't require the need to maintain and purchase expensive inventories or equipment. 
The healthcare and dental industry secured a spot on the Sageworks list, but these are industries that require expensive inventory and equipment to be both purchased and maintained. However, Bierman pointed out that the demand for healthcare-related services makes up for the cost and maintenance of essential equipment and inventory needs.
"Obviously healthcare and dental practices do have to invest considerably in technology and supplies," Bierman said. "Their services are inevitably in demand even during slow economic times, which reduces pressure on their profitability levels."
For years, accounting-related services have proved to be a consistent winner on the several profitable industries lists. Why does this industry continue to remain on top? Omar Khedr, an author of a 2015 top industries list created by the National Center for Education Statistics, cited job stability as a reason for the industry's success. 
"The Accounting Services industry presents a stable field for recent graduates, especially for accountants and auditors who will go on to earn statutory titles, such as Certified Public Accountant (CPA)," Khedr wrote, according to Accounting Today. "The industry is closely tied to the health of the overall economy, which has been accelerating in recent years."
Bierman told International Business Times Thursday that the industry's business model also enhances its success.
"While there are probably a few contributing factors, a significant driver of that profitability is the industry's business model," Bierman said. "These firms don't have huge inventories to buy or maintain, and they do not have to invest as much into R&D. Rather their assets are their experience, certifications and talented staff. That human capital allows them to operate with high gross margins."
Consultant Allan Koltin pointed out to Accounting Today in 2016 that Level 1 services (compliance services) are slowly dying within the industry. Level 2 (estate planning and tax solutions), Level 3 (advisory work and consulting) and  Level 4 (wealth management) services are likely to be in higher demand because they involve necessities that clients are willing to pay advisors more for.  
"A Level 1 service is a service a client doesn’t want but needs. A Level 2 service is a service a client both wants and needs, and hence, will pay value for," Koltin said. 
It pays to secure a position within the accounting-related services industry. According to Salary.com, the annual salary on average ranges from $49,647 for an entry level accountant to $144,901 for an accounting director.

An unfortunate but perhaps humorous oversight led to the prominent appearance of male genitalia on Bing’s homepage Thursday morning. The search engine featured a picture of a beach as its splashed image, with one Twitter user noting that a quick zoom revealed a large phallus drawn into the sand.
“Lol there's a penis carved into the sand on http://bing.com homepage,” developer  Andrew Lyle tweeted Thursday with a link to a screengrab on Imgur, a photo-sharing platform. The image had more than 1.2 million views by Thursday afternoon.
"There's a penis carved into the beach in Bing's background image," the August 17, 2016 photo on Imgur was captioned. Photo: Imgur
Visitors to Bing will fail to find the image in question, as it appeared to have been scrubbed from the site. Responding to Lyle’s tweet, user MisterMajikBear wrote, “It looks like they edited it out.”
However, as one Twitter user pointed out and International Business Times confirmed, there is another penis-shaped silhouette that makes an appearance in the photo. Coral around the beach, which  Gizmodo noted is Zlatni rat beach on Brač Island, Croatia, revealed another phallus.

According to a Quora response  pointed to by Motherboard, Vishal R Joshi — who claimed to have worked at Microsoft when the question was  answered in 2013 — wrote that the site refreshes images on its website daily.
The Register, a British technology website, appeared to confirm the legitimacy of the original photo posted to Imgur Thursday: “Our probing investigative team in the UK earlier had a stiff drink, took a close look, and verified this was legit and not a prank Photoshop.”
Bing did not immediately have a comment on the photo when reached by IBT.


American Airlines faced a lawsuit Tuesday after a woman alleged that the airline's flight attendant deliberately destroyed her wedding dress in August 2015. The court papers claimed Yewande Oteh of Cherry Hill, New Jersey, decided to sue the airline after it failed to prevent or investigate the incident.
Oteh was flying from Philadelphia International Airport to her destination wedding in Montego Bay, Jamaica, when the incident took place. The lawsuit claims that flight attendant Melanie Masters put something into the overhead bin where her dress was stored just after an argument between the two. The lawsuit alleged that Masters conspired with co-workers to stain her gown with red wine. Oteh and her family are suing American Airlines for more than $300,000, alleging that the airline over the “willful and wanton” actions on its part.
Court documents, obtained by the Courier-Post, reveals Oteh's complaint that describes her ordeal began when authorities asked her to remove her gown from a checked bag at the Philadelphia airport. She said a ticketing agent told her that there would be room to hand the dress in the aircraft's closet. However, after she boarded the flight Masters did not allow her to store her dress in the closet, saying that it was not for passengers to keep their items. 
Masters "became indignant and agitated, and began to talk to the plaintiff in a hostile aggressive way, instructing her that the closet space was not for passengers," the lawsuit claims.  
Oteh was later told to store the dress in an overhead bin. Oteh, who was traveling with her then-would-be-husband and their 9-month-old son, saw the flight attendant reopen the bin while conversing with two of her co-workers.
“It was [Oteh’s] belief that the flight attendants were placing something in the bin and making fun of [Oteh] and her wedding gown,” reads the lawsuit, according to the Courier-Post.
When Oteh arrived in Jamaica she found that her dress was covered with wine stains. The incident made Oteh “emotionally distraught” and forced her to cancel planned events with her guests, the lawsuit claimed. 
Oteh’s mother, Yvette Sterling reportedly said: “American Airlines and its personnel robbed us all of this once-in-a-lifetime experience.”
In a statement to International Business Times, American Airlines confirmed about “reviewing the lawsuit,” but no other detail was given out.
Over the last few months, American Airlines found itself in hot water with several passenger complaints. Earlier this month, actress Lana Dunham slammed American Airlines flight attendants for "having a transphobic talk." In another incident that took place in July, a woman claimed that she was forced by a flight attendant to sit next to a man who masturbated while she slept during a flight to Paris.


Two flights from two different airlines collided Tuesday evening on the tarmac at New York’s John F. Kennedy Airport. The carriers told International Business Times in respective statements that the incident occurred after a Delta Air Lines plane struck an American Airlines plane Tuesday evening.
American Airlines Flight 290 to Dublin was reportedly stationary on the tarmac and awaiting departure clearance when the wing of Delta Air Lines Flight 2503 to Seattle came into contact with the tail of the other plane. The Delta Air Lines plane was attempting to maneuver around the other aircraft at the time of the collision,  Forbes reported Wednesday.
“While on taxi, the wing of flight 2503 came in contact with the tail of another aircraft,” Delta Air Lines told IBT Wednesday. “The flight returned to the gate and passengers deplaned normally. We’re sorry for the inconvenience to customers.”
&quot;We had a big jolt, and he has a big scrape on his left wing,” the American pilot told controllers… via @forbes https://t.co/a9yWW6WRZ0

“The Delta at our three o’clock we are pretty sure his winglet, ran into us as he passed behind us,” the American Airlines captain reported during the collision, per a statement to IBT. “We had a big jolt, and he has a big scrape on his left wing.”
American Airlines told IBT that no passengers or crew were injured during the event. Passengers aboard the American Airlines flight were transferred to a different plane and later successfully departed. 
Delta Air Lines spokeswoman Betsy Talton told Forbes that there were 160 passengers aboard its flight. The American Airlines flight reportedly carried 121 passengers.
“We’re sorry for the inconvenience to our customers,” Talton told Forbes, refusing to comment further after citing a potential federal safety investigation.
Both planes showed visible signs of damage, with  photos obtained by Forbes indicating that the damage to the American Airlines craft was much more severe. Repair of the American Airlines plane could reportedly take at least a week, according to a mechanic who assessed photos of the damage for Forbes.

PepsiCo's Chief Executive Officer Indra Nooyi is being pressured to exit President Trump's business council from online racial justice organization Color Of Change (COC), according to CNN.
Following the events that occurred in Charlottesville, Virginia, six CEOs — including those of Intel and Under Armour— announced their departure from Trump's advisory council. Nooyi, a powerful minority woman in business, has not deterred from her post. What does Pepsi have to gain financially from associating with Trump?
According to Business Insider, CEOs were willing to join Trump's business councils as a way to help the president make better decisions about American business. As an Indian-born businesswoman, Nooyi has claimed that hiring more minorities is "a business imperative," according to CNBC. Nooyi could have joined to bring her business beliefs at PepsiCo into action within Trump's business council, which currently has 36 percent of its senior executives as people of color. 
However, PepsiCo's stock is currently down, according to Bloomberg. Additionally, Americans are consuming fewer soda products as it is, a separate report from Bloomberg found. InvestorPlace reported that sales for Nooyi's company were below Coke in July. 
Nooyi is now the only person of color that holds a position within the president's advisory council. Her decision to continue working alongside Trump has led COC to address a letter to her and other CEOs still involved, but the letter primarily targeted her and IBM CEO Ginni Rometty.
"Any cooperation with Donald Trump on business matters or otherwise, will be an endorsement of his hate-filled and racist rhetoric which runs counter to the family-friendly values of your company," the letter read. "We believe that it is in your best interest to quit the Business Council before you and your company are indelibly sullied with the hateful and divisive actions of the Trump administration."
COC has urged its 1 million advocates to apply pressure on Pepsi to dump Trump in its latest campaign. CEOs from Merck & Co. (Kenneth C. Frazier), Disney (Bob Iger), Uber (formerly Travis Kalanick) and Tesla (Elon Musk) quit Trump's Business Council with the help of the organization's pressure.
The campaign pleaded, "In the wake of Trump's tacit response to Charlottesville — a response that has been applauded on stormfront — it is reprehensible that any CEO would continue to carry water for this administration."
Nooyi spoke in a similar tone to COCs following the events in Charlottesville Saturday. She tweeted a response to the events, saying, "Heartbroken by the violence in #Charlottesville. Hate and intolerance are a betrayal of what we stand for as Americans."

The PepsiCo CEO initially voiced her support for Hillary Clinton during the election period. In speaking with The New York Times after the election concluded, Nooyi congratulated Trump for his win. She also added, "The process of democracy happened. We just need to let life go on."
Since joining Trump's business council in December, she has not provided comment publicly on her involvement. CEOs from Walmart and Campbell Soup Company are also receiving pressure from COC, but neither corporations seem as if they are willing to budge. 
A representative of PepsiCo did not immediately return International Business Times' request for comment.

Uber has started settling its multiple disputes with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) — the government agency for consumer protection — which announced Tuesday it has agreed to 20 years of FTC privacy audits. The settlement was a result of an investigation into Uber’s doxing — publishing private information online — of journalists critical of the company.
Uber was also under investigation for a God View tool which provided its employees access to user data. This was called ‘public stalking’ by high-profile users such as entrepreneur Peter Sims. The company also had a secret method of blocking users called Greyballing. It showed only ghost cars, i.e. those which were present only in the app rather than real cars, allowing Uber to skirt law enforcement officials when not operating in zone allowed by a city’s authorities.
“Respondent has engaged in a number of practices that, taken together, failed to provide reasonable security to prevent unauthorized access to Rider and Driver personal information… “It is further ordered that, in connection with its compliance with the Provision of this Order titled Mandated Privacy Program, Respondent must obtain initial and biennial assessments,” the FTC document said in addition to ordering privacy assessments by a third party.
Uber has to report to FTC for the first 180 days and then go for an assessment every two years for following 20 years.
But, is your user data, including the most important location data on the app safe?
Uber submitting to an FTC assessment for the first six months means the data will go into the hands of a government authority. Furthermore, it is not yet known whether the data from private assessor will have FTC oversight.
But one thing is certain. The kind of access Uber employees have to your data will be under strict scrutiny.
"Uber failed consumers in two key ways: First by misrepresenting the extent to which it monitored its employees’ access to personal information about users and drivers, and second by misrepresenting that it took reasonable steps to secure that data. This case shows that, even if you’re a fast-growing company, you can’t leave consumers behind: you must honor your privacy and security promises," FTC Acting Chairman Maureen Ohlhausen said in a statement.
Since there are no federal privacy laws, the government currently cannot hold Uber’s feet to the fire when it comes to following its own stated privacy policy. Yet the FTC has been trying its best — besides Uber, Google, and Facebook in the past have been ordered to undergo 20 years of privacy audits.
Uber itself has previously been fined $20 million by the FTC for misleading them about how much money they could make.
"People always complain that this is a slap on the wrist compared to Europe. But there's only so much the FTC can do." Woodrow Hartzog, a professor of law and computer science at Northeastern University School of Law, told Wired Tuesday.


Following the Charlottesville attack which highlighted the surge of violence among the white nationalist groups in America, tech companies are looking at the ramifications of letting hate groups use their platforms and services. After GoDaddy de-registered the domain of the racist site the Daily Stormer, and gaming chat app Discord shut down the accounts associated with the attack, social networking sites Facebook and Reddit have started targeting hate groups.
The social networking companies confirmed to CNET on Tuesday they would ban groups that violate their hate-speech policies. The Charlottesville attack received widespread condemnation, however, some far-right and Neo-Nazi groups celebrated the attack on the social platforms. These incidents triggered social networking companies to take stringent action against those inciting violence on their platforms.
The subreddit, r/physical_removal, received scrutiny from Reddit — moderators and people posting on the threads were flagged by the social network.
While both Facebook and Reddit have a history of racist content being posted on their platforms, the recent attack has made even them step up vigilance against these groups. Facebook removed the Charlotteville’s "Unite The Right" page and all links to an article attacking Charlottesville victim Heather Heyer on the racist website the Daily Stormer, except the ones condemning the article.
While the Daily Stormer itself has gone down due to domain de-registration by Google and GoDaddy, Facebook has banned a number of far-right groups, such as:
A Facebook representative told CNET the company will actively target hate groups and attempt to stop them from organizing on the platform. Echoing Facebook's sentiments, Reddit said in a statement to the publication: "We are very clear in our site terms of service that posting content that incites violence will get users banned from Reddit. We have banned /r/Physical_Removal due to violations of the terms of our content policy.”
While banning of such groups has drawn criticism as it is being seen by some as an attack on free speech, in light of incidents such as the Charlottesville attack, it has become necessary for social networks to take action against hateful or racist content.
While hate groups will simply migrate to other platforms, removing them from public ones such as Facebook will make them not so easy to access.
For instance, the Daily Stormer has moved on to the Dark Web, according to Reuters, the domain de-registration.  This means that people will not have access to it on the mainstream internet, but will continue to remain accessible for its dedicated users.
This only serves to reduce public exposure to violent ideologies and hides such discussions as the one that triggered the Charlottesville attack.


Uber will reportedly introduce a newly enhanced version of Uber for Business, according to TechCrunch. The Uber for Business update was confirmed Tuesday by the company, which will offer custom travel programs and new regulations. 
The revamped version intends to provide new tools to make it easier for employers to manage travel options for its employees. While the service's updated guidelines are easier for companies to use, employees will no longer be able to utilize the service for personal needs after-hours, as stricter regulations on employee use will be enforced. 
"The dashboard is where you'll manage all your ground transportation and customize how people can use your Uber for Business account," Uber's website explained in a note on how its new travel accommodations would be executed. 
This program can help employers determine the type of car that can be requested, expense allotments for riders, when Uber can be used by workers and location limits that can be accessed. Regulations like these can be purchased by companies through customizable programs.
The ride service claimed its new rules will work because companies and its employees "don't have to worry about out-of-policy rides." According to an Uber for Business informational booklet, Companies will now have access to real-time reporting, which will help employers to further implement its transportation policies through the service. Available reports include monthly savings costs, automatic receipt forwarding and a detailed trip dashboard, among other options.
Uber claimed its updated service will provide an enhanced experience for employees, too. Employees will be able to "forget about pre-booking rides, picking up rental cars, waiting in taxi lines, or finding parking." Employees can be notified of rides within the Uber app, but those who don't have a smart phone or an Uber account will still be able to utilize the program.
Uber for Business will also benefit employees who require ride accommodations (i.e. individuals with disabilities), which can be directed to the driver through customized notes. However, companies will now have the ability to decide which workers will be given the opportunity to receive the Uber for Business benefits. 
A press representative issued a statement to International Business Times Tuesday from Julie Herendeen, who is the head of marketing and strategy for Uber for Business. Herendeen said that the new features are available today.
"Business travelers were amongst Uber's earliest adopters, and organizations needed streamlined billing, reporting and management tools for their employee's Uber usage," Herendeen said. "That's why we launched Uber for Business three years ago."
Uber for Business emerged three years ago and promised to make the transportation needs of employees and their companies smoother and cost-effective. According to ZDNet.com, "Uber for Business has won over a large share of business travel with 65,000 customers. In just the last six months of this year, revenue on the platform has tripled."
Dell, Goldman Sachs, TripAdvisor and Evernote are among a list of more than 65,000 companies that utilize Uber for Bussiness today.
According to a post published on Uber's blog, Uber for Business was created "to help organizations perfect the way they move the people that matter to them. And while our initial focus was on driving business travel efficiency through features like monthly billing and reporting, it didn’t take long before we realized that organizations needed Uber for a lot more."

Those looking to secure a spot at the Cheeto pop-up restaurant in New York may be in for some disappointment: reservations are completely booked. The Spotted Cheetah, which opened Tuesday and was scheduled to run only through Thursday, will feature gourmet meals centered around the orange snack. Its waiting list has reportedly already amassed more than 1,000 individuals hoping to get a seat.
The limited-run, Cheeto-focused pop-up only budgeted for 300 seats, all of which are currently spoken for, the  Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday. Plates are priced from $8 to $22 and include the Flamin’ Hot and White Cheddar Mac n’ Cheetos, Cheetos Crusted Fried Pickles + Creamy Ranch and Flamin’ Hot Limón Chicken Tacos.
“I’m thrilled that you have shown interest in my restaurant,” reads an email sent to users who are waitlisted for the restaurant. “The Spotted Cheetah, and seem to love Cheetos (almost) as much as I do. Unfortunately, at this time all of the spots are full. If we have a table open up, we’ll give you a ring.”

Ryan Matiyow, a senior director of marketing at Frito-Lay, told the Journal that the demand for the restaurant  “was a surprise to us in a big way.” Matiyow previously  told AdWeek that the team behind the restaurant was “inspired by Cheetos fans and popular restaurants nationwide.”
“As all of you (hopefully) know, I have a passion for cheesy, crunchy and downright delicious food,” reads a message attributed to Chester Cheetah, the brand’s fictional mascot, on the restaurant's website. “After years of cooking up dishes infused with my cheesy snacks, I was over the moon to discover that Cheetos connoisseurs had started sharing and liking their own.”
The message continued, “All of the Cheetos sushi rolls, Cheetos bagels and cheesy Cheetos pizzas gave me a brilliant idea: recruit the most dangerously cheesy celebrity chef, Anne Burrell, to help elevate my almost-purrfect Cheetos recipes for the very first Cheetos restaurant, The Spotted Cheetah.”
Would-be patrons may still have a shot at tasting the offerings of the Cheeto-themed menu, however. A Spotted Cheetah Digital Cookbook is available for  free download on the restaurant's website.
The Spotted Cheetah is located at 211 West Broadway in New York. A representative for the Spotted Cheetah did not immediately return International Business Times’ request for comment.

UPS announced Tuesday its plans to incorporate virtual reality (VR) technology into its training program for new drivers, according to CNN. New drivers will reportedly not be allowed to step foot behind the wheel until they can successfully pass.
VR will help to provide drivers with a more realistic training experience by allowing trainees the ability to drive the company's 10,000-pound truck through advanced technology. Trainees will understand how to maneuver in UPS trucks on city streets as they learn how to spot road hazards. The tests are slated to last roughly three to six minutes.
UPS shared a video about its training program to the company's YouTube page, which was also promoted through UPS' Twitter account. The package delivery company claims its method will use VR technology to help enhance driver safety.
The video's caption explains that UPS has decided to push the use of VR in its training program because the company wants to use "the latest and best technology to protect its on-road employees and the communities they serve."
"The headset is realistic down to the finest details. We're using #virtualreality to teach driver safety training," UPS said in a tweet Tuesday.
The headset is realistic down to the finest details. We're using #virtualreality to teach driver safety training. https://t.co/UtCRS7fR0H
— UPS (@UPS) August 15, 2017
A UPS representative issued a statement to International Business times Tuesday about this newly implemented company policy from Laura Collings, who serves as a training and development manager for the company. 
"UPS is completely committed to driver safety. We have been for more than 100 years," Collings said. "That's why we use the best and latest technology to ensure the best training for our drivers. Our goal is to have the safest drivers on the road."
Collins added, "VR headsets will replace the touchscreen devices we currently use to teach student drivers about road hazards. VR is far more realistic, engaging and memorable. This technology is a big step forward in driver safety. We are studying applications for Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality in other types of training as well as for use in our operation."
The VR program will be executed at all nine of UPS Integrad training facilities in the United States. UPS Intergrad has training facilities located in Atlanta, Georgia and West Boylston, Massachusetts, among seven other cities nationwide. 
UPS recognized they needed to enhance its training program to engage new employees, especially those in younger age demographics. The UPS Integrad fact sheet reads, "We realized that we needed to make an adjustment when our younger drivers began needing significantly more time to become proficient in the required skills, and more of them were leaving the company during their initial training period."
"The VR rollout to the nine UPS Integrad locations starts in September. It won't be all at once. But it will be pretty fast. It may take a couple of months," Kyle Peterson, a press representative for UPS, told IBT Tuesday.
UPS isn't the only company that is using VR technology to train its employees. According to Business Insider, multinational retailer Walmart announced in June that it will begin to use VR headsets to prepare employees across the US for the job. Walmart, who launched its first training academy in 2016, reportedly plans to implement this training practice by the end of the year.

Airbnb announced Tuesday its decision to place a permanent ban on white supremacists from booking lodging through its services, according to The Independent. 
Airbnb co-founder Nathan Blecharczyk confirmed the new policy in an interview with Bloomberg TV. Blecharczyk's announcement comes on the heels of the violent protests that broke out among alt-right supporters and counter-protesters in Charlottesville, Virginia over the weekend. The co-founder asserted that his company will cancel reservations after he was alerted to a large gathering of white supremacists in Charlottesville. 
Blecharczyk told Bloomberg TV that the "hate displayed this week has been shocking."
"We make every one of our users sign a pledge when they sign up that they will not discriminate and exhibit hatred," he added. "Whenever we become aware of such examples they are permanently banned from [the] platform."
According to BuzzFeed, Airbnb will not only ban alt-right supporters from making reservations, but the company has begun the process of deactivating the accounts of said individuals.  
A statement on Airbnb's new policy change was issued to International Business Times Tuesday from the company's CEO Brian Chesky. Chesky said "the violence, racism and hatred demonstrated by Neo-Nazis, the alt-right, and white supremacists should have no place in this world."
"Earlier this month, we learned that some people were organizing to stay in and hold a series of after parties at several Airbnb listings while in town to attend this terrible event," Chesky said. "As we explained to members of the media who contacted us last week, we require those who are members of the Airbnb community to accept people regardless of their race, religion, national origin, ethnicity, disability, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, or age."
Chesky added, "When we see people pursuing behavior on the platform that would be antithetical to the Airbnb Community Commitment, we take appropriate action. In this case, last week, we removed these people from Airbnb. Airbnb will continue to stand for acceptance and we will continue to do all we can to enforce our community commitment."
Jason Kessler, a blogger and organizer of the "Unite the Right" rally in Charlottesville, noticed Airbnb's new policy change leading up to the protest. He took to Twitter August 7 to encourage his followers to boycott Airbnb because he saw the company's actions as a violation of white supremacists' civil rights and alleged that "free speech and civil rights under attack" by Airbnb. 
Kessler said in the Twitter video post, "You see this thing going that's going on with Airbnb. Anybody who is not just in the alt-right, but who is conservative, right-wing or cares about civil liberties should start boycotting Airbnb. Airbnb are canceling people's reservations to stay in Charlottesville ... based on political ideology."

Airbnb Community Commitment, which launched in 2016, is signed by all people who choose to use its services. The community guidelines entail that the company plans "to fight bias and discrimination in the Airbnb community." Its decision to ban white supremacists from utilizing its services falls in line with Airbnb's Community Commitment agreement.
The policy claims that if users choose to opt out of the agreement, they "will not be able to host or book using Airbnb and will have the option to cancel your account. Once an account is canceled, future booked trips will be canceled." According to the agreement, users can, however, be reinstated. The policy states that "if in the future you accept the commitment to inclusion, you’re welcome to come back."

Kim Kardashian’s wildly successful KKW Beauty line is bracing for the release of a new product: Powder Contour & Highlight Kits dropping August 22. Ahead of next week’s launch, the 36-year-old beauty mogul told fans in a series of Snapchats that they’re “stressing me the f—k out” in response to criticism of her makeup swatches.
“Okay guys, I get it. I didn’t know how to f—ing swatch powders before at the beginning,” Kardashian said. “I’m learning, but you’re stressing me the f—k out.”
She added, “At least the product — at least we can back it up. Just wait until you get it. You’ll be pleasantly surprised. I’m not worried.”
The “Keeping Up with the Kardashians” star shared the Snaps while preparing for a shoot with Mario Dedivanovic, her close friend and KKW collaborator. The beauty maven posted the Snaps in response to critics who pointed out that Kardashian had poorly swatched her Powder Contour & Highlight Kits in previous videos.

Ahead of the launch of her Powder Contour & Highlight Kits, Kardashian came under fire Tuesday for defending past racist comments made by beauty blogger Jeffree Star, with whom Kardashian has worked in the past. Star  wrote on Twitter that Kardashian’s swatches for the new product looked like “chalk.” Kardashian on Monday came to his defense in a series of Snapchats.
“Guys, I see that my fans are totally hating on someone like Jeffree Star for being, you know honest about my struggle swatches,” she said. “But because of his remarks I'm learning from the best, like from Mario, how to swatch properly.”
Fans were quick to point to Star’s past racist commentary while also noting that both Kardashian’s children and husband are African American.
“Kim K., like so many other white women who have black children/spouses, has the luxury of overlooking racism when it's convenient for her,”  wrote one Twitter user.
Another user  tweeted, “Can someone tell Kim K that having a black husband and biracial kids doesn't make her the authority on what black people should forgive.”
Kardashian apologized Tuesday for telling fans to look beyond Star’s racist commentary.
“I really wanted to apologize to you guys and my fans for defending a situation that I didn’t know enough about,” she said. “I just feel a bit naive and I do really want to apologize for me feeling like I had the right say ‘get over it’ in a situation that involves racism. I don’t really feel like I have the right to speak on that. I really, really, really am sorry.”

In 2015, then-Gov. Mike Pence made the controversial decision to keep the Indiana Toll Road under the control of a consortium of private corporations, which was  represented by a local lobbying firm that had funneled large donations to Pence’s gubernatorial campaign. This year, the same lobby firm signed up to press the Donald Trump administration on behalf of IFM Investors — the same foreign company that Pence originally approved to run the toll road consortium.
In fact, documents reviewed by International Business Times show the lobbying firm that bankrolled Pence has been in direct contact with the vice president on federal infrastructure policy. The firm has lobbied Pence on behalf of Melbourne-based IFM as Pence has  explicitly extolled IFM in his work spearheading a White House plan to privatize roads, bridges and airports. That trillion-dollar initiative, which Trump is scheduled to promote on Tuesday and which could  enrich foreign investors, comes as Trump has  said he is focused on “putting America first.”
In response to IBT's questions, White House spokesperson Natalie Strom said in a written statement that Trump “has made it clear that his priority is investment in American infrastructure” and that White House staff “welcome foreign companies who recognize that under President Trump, building American infrastructure is a good investment.” She pointed to a January  memorandum pushing for the use of American steel in future pipeline projects.
Last week, an IBT investigative  report documented how Pence, in 2015, rejected local counties’ bid to reclaim the 155-mile-long Indiana Toll Road, after the private consortium operating it declared bankruptcy. In making that decision, he also rejected Democratic U.S. Sen. Joe Donnelly’s  request that he consider having the state disband the private consortium and take back the road. State records reviewed by IBT show Pence received more than  $116,000 from Bose, McKinney & Evans LLP — the parent company of Bose Public Affairs Group LLC, which served as the  lobbying  firm for the consortium.
Fast forward less than two years later: Only weeks after Pence was sworn in as vice president, and had  visited Australia to pitch foreign investors on the Trump administration’s privatization plan, Bose  registered to lobby for IFM in Washington. The company lobbied specifically on “infrastructure investment,” a gig that netted Bose  $80,000 so far this year.
In subsequent federal documents filed as Pence continued to advocate for privatization, Bose  listed “Vice President of the U.S.” as one of the people it contacted on behalf of IFM in its lobbying on the Trump administration’s “plan as it related to publicly-stated infrastructure investment.” Bose has also expressly lobbied Pence on other issues, such as health care policy, on behalf of the insurance giant UnitedHealth Group, other  filings show.
Lisa Gilbert, the vice president of legislative affairs at the consumer rights advocacy group Public Citizen, said while Pence’s connection to the firms was “unsavory” and “raises red flags,” no conflict-of-interest or ethics rules had been breached, and the use of such ties is a commonality in Washington.
“The vice president absolutely has influence on policy,” she said, when asked whether IFM and Bose’s specific targeting of Pence was unusual. “That in itself is not shocking, nor is it shocking that they’d lobby him directly because of their past relationship.”
In a crowded market for infrastructure, she noted, the potential beneficiaries will do what they can to get ahead of the competition.
In a statement, IFM Executive Director Tom Osborne asserted that “infrastructure procurement involving the private sector is generally subject to significant probity processes, which ensure that governments of all levels are selecting the best value-for-money proposals from competitive fields of bidders.” Osborne did not address questions related to Pence’s history with the firm, or its lobbyist’s history with Pence, and whether that raised conflicts-of-interest or ethics concerns, or how IFM is working with the White House to shape infrastructure policy.
Bose did not immediately return requests for comment from IBT, nor did Pence’s office.
During Pence’s April visit to Australia — which took place during the same quarter in which Bose reported that it had lobbied Pence — the vice president explicitly  promoted IFM, and as recently as June, representatives for Australian firms like IFM have returned the favor,  paying the White House visits to try to influence the administration’s infrastructure initiative. IFM’s chief executive openly acknowledged his firm’s attempts to benefit from the White House’s infrastructure policy plans, telling a  newspaper that his corporation wants to invest in American infrastructure under the privatization plan that Pence has been pitching..
In addition to federal records stating IFM directly appealed to Pence when lobbying on infrastructure, another  filing shows — through its other main lobbyist, Mayer Brown LLP — IFM lobbied the National Economic Council. The council’s director, Gary Cohn,  previously served as president and chief operating officer of Goldman Sachs, another frequent participant in public-private partnership infrastructure projects. Goldman raked in  millions of dollars in fees for its work on the original 2006 deal to privatize the Indiana Toll Road.
Bose and IFM are not the only foreign corporate interests linked to Indiana that have been lobbying the Trump administration on its infrastructure privatization plan.
Sydney, Australia-based Macquarie Group — the investment firm that partnered with Goldman on, and bankrupted, the Indiana Toll Road — is also pushing its infrastructure agenda in Washington. And it has good reason to: As a previous IBT  report on public-private infrastructure projects found, Macquarie has been a leading investor in similar projects in Dallas, Denver and Norfolk, Va. and in a bridge connecting New York’s Staten Island to northeast New Jersey.
A federal lobbying  form for the second quarter of this year showed Macquarie, through the firm K&L Gates LLP, lobbied the House, Senate and Department of Transportation on “issues related to asset recycling,” a common term for infrastructure privatization. A former Macquarie executive, DJ Gribbin, now works on infrastructure policy at Trump’s NEC. He previously  served  as the Department of Transportation’s general counsel and as chief counsel of the Federal Highway Administration under President George W. Bush.
Spanish transportation infrastructure giant Cintra SA, another member of the bankrupted Indiana Toll Road consortium, has also been busy on the lobbying front. This year, Cintra paid SB Capitol Solutions close to $40,000 to lobby on “legislation, authorization and appropriations bills related to issues of private company financing for transportation infrastructure,”  lobbying  forms show.
Cintra, along with its parent company, Ferrovial SA,  is a member of the Association for the Improvement of American Infrastructure (AIAI).  Documents reviewed by IBT show that group lobbied Trump’s White House, the National Economic Council and the Department of Transportation to “increase federal financial incentives for the use of public-private partnerships for infrastructure” and “support for the greater use of public-private partnerships for infrastructure projects in policy proposals from the presidential administration.”
The group also  lobbied to “streamline and expedite environmental reviews for infrastructure projects,” a priority that is expected to be  enshrined by Trump’s infrastructure-related executive order on Tuesday.
AIAI’s lobbying went through the public-private partnerships-focused firm ThinkP3 LLC — which is  run  by former Republican congressional staffers.
“There is certainly a race to be a part of the infrastructure plans that the White House is creating,” Gilbert, of Public Citizen, said. “The list of unfunded plans is massive.”
Asked whether IFM, Bose, Macquarie, Cintra, Goldman and others’ connections to leaders in the White House provided their lobbyists with an advantage, Gilbert added, “any relationship gives you an edge.”


An official in Richland County, South Carolina, raised some eyebrows for a comment he made at a staff meeting in which he told his employees to end their lives. He was later forced to resign.
Assistant County Administrator Kevin Bronson made the comment to the emergency medical service people he oversees after they complained about their working conditions.
“If it’s that bad, you can leave. You can leave or go kill yourself,” Bronson told his employee Saturday, according to WSOC, an ABC news affiliate in Charlotte, North Carolina.
“The room erupted in emotion,” an employee, who asked to remain anonymous, told WSOC. “People were crying. People were yelling at him. One, we just lost a deputy because of suicide. Two, I don't think he understands the gravity of the situation. We're not here for the money, we're here because we love what we do .”
The meeting had around 100 people in it.
Bronson handed in his letter of resignation Monday after his comments caused a firestorm among emergency service personnel, firefighters and police, according to WCSC, a CBS news affiliate in Charleston, South Carolina.
“My disrespectful words hurt and offended many people in the Richland County Government, especially the EMS workers, EMS workers across this country and surviving friends and families of loved ones of suicide,” Bronson wrote. “I am sorry … (it was a) horrible and terrible thing for me to say.”
Bronson said in the statement that he had hoped to stay in the position to right his actions but deemed that inappropriate.
Richland County Administrator Gerald Seals also released a statement condemning the comments.
“While public recounting of the incident has been mischaracterized, the fact that such comments were made will not be tolerated. Although this Assistant Administrator promptly apologized, more needed to be done — and he has been disciplined. On behalf of Richland County, I also apologize for what happened and regret that an employee in the Administrator’s Office spoke in such a manner,” said Seals.


Air Berlin announced Tuesday it was filing for insolvency after its main shareholder, Etihad Airways, said it would no longer support the company financially. Air Berlin said it would continue operating its flights despite the court filing.
Insolvency occurs when a corporation can no longer pay its debts and meet its financial obligations with lenders. It refers to the financial state of the organization, whereas bankruptcy refers to the actual legal process that attempts to resolve insolvency.
“Etihad has notified Air Berlin of the fact of the fact that it will not provide any further financial support,” Air Berlin said in a statement Tuesday. “The board of directors of Air Berlin PLC has, after close evaluation, determined that Air Berlin PLC has no longer a positive continuation prognosis.”

Etihad said it decided to withdraw funding from Air Berlin after the German carrier’s operations deteriorated at an “unprecedented pace,” Bloomberg News reported Tuesday. Air Berlin lost more than $3.1 billion in just over six years.
Two board representatives at Etihad resigned. By filing for insolvency, Air Berlin became the second major European airline to fail in just four months. Etihad Airways also pulled funding from Italian carrier Alitalia in May.
Air Berlin was set to continue its flights by way of an emergency government loan of 150 million euros. Germany’s Economy Minister Brigitte Zypries said the emergency loan should allow the carrier to continue operating for three months, according to Bloomberg News. The loan would also secure the jobs of 7,200 workers while the company decided on its future.
Lufthansa, one of the carrier’s main rivals, was also said to be in talks to buy part of the corporation. Discussions between the two corporations were going well, according to Zypries, who expected a deal to be struck within just a few months.
“Lufthansa has played a canny waiting game over a number of years,” Jonathan Wober, an analyst at the CAPA-Centre for Aviation, told Reuters. “[It] is now well-placed to cherry pick those parts of Air Berlin’s operations that suit it best without buying the whole loss-making enterprise.”

A local doctor was credited with saving a life this week after he helped a woman who is believed to have overdosed Friday on a Minneapolis-bound Spirit Airlines flight from Boston. Dr. Anil Punjabi, a Boston cardiologist, and a number of other crew and passengers worked to keep the woman alive for 25 minutes as the plane made an emergency landing.
The woman, who was not identified, visited the plane’s lavatory for a lengthy period of time before other passengers alerted crew aboard the flight, Fox-affiliate  WFXT reported Monday. When she returned to her seat, she was slumped over and began turning gray before passengers realized the woman wasn’t breathing. That’s when Punjabi was called to help.
Working with Punjabi, the crew and nurse — as well as an EMT trainee — worked to keep the woman breathing by administering CPR for the better part of half an hour before the plane could safely land. While attempting to keep her alive, they allegedly found a needle hidden in the woman’s bra.
"We were down on the ground within 25 minutes, but at that time she was completely unresponsive,” Punjabi told the station.
He added, “It's not an uncommon sight. Even if you walk around Boston, there are certain areas you know that are affected by this more than others. It was actually pretty shocking that this would happen on a plane.”
Pointing to the prevalence of the opioid epidemic, Punjabi said that Narcan — which is used for opioid overdoses — is a necessary tool for airline staff to be able to effectively treat passengers who suffer overdoses aboard flights.
The number of opioid-related overdoses that resulted in death has more than quadrupled since 1999, according to the Centers For Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The  CDC reported an estimated 91 Americans die daily from an opioid overdose, which includes prescriptions opioids and heroin — but that figure could actually be significantly higher.
As International Business Times  previously reported, the American Journal of Preventive Medicine published a new study earlier this month revealing opioid- and heroin-related deaths nationwide to be 24 percent and 22 percent higher, respectively, than previously recorded.
A representative for Spirit Airlines did not immediately return International Business Times’ request for comment.

Netflix scored a major win Monday, stealing Shonda Rhimes, creator of shows like “Grey’s Anatomy” and “Scandal,” away from ABC. Rhimes, in a multiyear deal, will produce new series and projects for the streaming service.
Specifics of the deal, which include bringing over Rhimes' production company, Shondaland, weren’t disclosed, but is likely in excess of $40 million. The Wall Street Journal, who first reported the deal, said Rhimes was making over $10 million a year in her four-year deal with ABC. The new contract’s timeline is similar, but worth more, Deadline reporter Nellie Andreeva wrote Monday.
Carnegie Mellon University information systems professor Rahul Telang didn’t want to speculate on a number, but said the writer would likely earn a large sum of money. A major move like this was predictable for Netflix. “This was likely to happen. The market is getting more competitive,” said Telang to International Business Times Monday.
ABC’s parent company, Disney, announced last week it would pull it’s movies from Netflix and will start its own streaming service around Disney, and another one around another one of its properties, ESPN.
Netflix spent $5 billion on content last year and is expected to spend over $6 billion this year. In addition to Rhimes, Netflix hooked David Letterman for a show and acclaimed directors Joel and Ethan Coen to create a Western show for Netflix.
Amazon’s streaming service is also spending a great deal of money on content like inking a $50 million deal earlier this year for the right to carry 10 Thursday night NFL games. Last year, Amazon spent over $3 billion on content, according to USA Today.
How long it will last for companies to spend so much on content remains to be seen.
“The more they spend the more they need to recoup,” said Thom Gencarelli, chair of the communications department at Manhattan College, to International Business Times Monday. “In the long run they will need to figure out how much the need to charge subscribers … and it comes down to how much people are willing to pay.”
For artists, the appeal of the streaming service is money and creative liberty. Without advertisers, Netflix producers have full artistic license — unrestrained by television censorship for nudity or violence. Netflix also doesn’t have commercial breaks, so shows don’t need to run on a rigid network clock like they would on ABC. More, episodes in a series don’t have to be the same length.
“They made her an offer she couldn’t refuse … and she will have full creative control without a network looking over her shoulder,” said Gencarelli.
Rhimes said that freedom was one aspect of why she took the deal.
“I was looking for — the opportunity to build a vibrant new storytelling home for writers with the unique creative freedom and instantaneous global reach provided by Netflix’s singular sense of innovation,” said Rhimes in a press release from Netflix.
Rhimes began Shondaland in 2005 with her producing partner, Betsy Beers, who will also move over to Netflix from ABC. Shondalfand’s first major hit was “Grey’s Anatomy,” which still runs on the channel. Rhime’s ABC shows will stay on the channel for now. She had a little over a year left in her contract with ABC, who allowed her to sign with Netflix.
Rhime’s publicist and representation did not respond for comment. Spokespersons for Netflix said they had nothing more to add beyond the press release.​


Following the death of a longtime Spirit Airlines baggage handler, his widow is suing the airline over his injury. Nazem Amine was 88 years old when he suffered a hernia in 2015 after lifting 500 pieces of luggage in a single shift. Amine died in July at the age of 90 from a heart attack. His wife, Siham Amine, said Spirit was responsible for the downward spiral of his health that ultimately resulted in his death.
Nazem had worked as a handler for Spirit for 16 years when he had a hernia. His 53-year-old wife filed a federal lawsuit in January when her husband was still alive but in a wheelchair, seeking compensation for medical expenses resulting from his hospitalization for a hernia, congestive heart failure and colitis.
The airline, however, said the Michigan Workers Compensation Board had not yet ruled on whether the heart attack was caused by the hernia, and additionally, that the compensation board had already paid the medical bills related to the hernia.

“We got not one apology from workers’ compensation or Spirit Airlines,” his son, Mike Amine, told the Detroit Free Press. “My dad never got to win at this… He never got his day in court… I feel like they did him wrong.”
The family said its patriarch was in great condition until suffering a hernia during his strenuous shift. A former Bronze medal winning Olympic wrestler, Nazem insisted on working well into his old age.
“He would say, ‘I don’t want anyone taking care of me. I want to take care of myself,’” Mike Amine told the Detroit Free Press. “Not only did he work full time, he worked overtime. And he didn’t just meet and greet people. This guy actually moved 500 pieces of luggage — in a day. That’s the kind of dedication he had to work.”
His widow is seeking $721,000 from Spirit Airlines, according to the lawsuit. Half of that would go toward Medicare.
“He was a worker. He was a go-getter. He wanted to bring home a paycheck,” said the Amine’s lawyer, Bryan Schefman. “Any guy who is 88 years old and can lift 500 bags seems to be in pretty good health. He died from secondary complications relating the complete meltdown of his physical status.”


Passengers aboard a recent Southwest Airlines flight competed in a “toilet paper race” orchestrated by flight attendants for the airline. The competition — which pitted the aisles against each other for a chance to be the first to deplane — was captured on video by one of the flight’s passengers and was posted to Facebook earlier this month.
Marcie Villarreal was a passenger on the flight from Raleigh to Denver and recorded the event mid-competition. In a 24-second clip posted to Facebook, passengers could be seen gently unrolling toilet paper passed from the front of the cabin to the back. Flight attendants could be heard commentating in the background over the flight’s intercom.

“I've been flying different airlines my whole life, and just when I think I've seen it all, your flight attendants decide to do a ‘toilet paper race,’” wrote Villarreal‎ in the video’s caption. “[H]ands down the funnest flight ever and I was even traveling with my baby. You rock, Southwest! Keep doing what you're doing!”
In a statement to International Business Times, a Southwest Airlines representative said: “We encourage our creative flight attendants have fun with customers and love that they help customers have a great time onboard.”
The video, which was shared to airline’s official Facebook page August 2, was liked nearly 7,000 times, was shared by 1,700 users and garnered well over 500 comments. Many commenters shared their experiences while flying with Southwest Airlines, and an overwhelming majority praised the airline for its service.
“Southwest has fun and creative employees always a treat when I fly with them,” wrote one user.
“I was on a flight to Seattle and we did the same thing! Love Southwest!” another person wrote, revealing that this is perhaps not the first occasion that the pastime has been used on the carrier’s flights.
A third individual wrote, “Before reading the entire post I thought this was just another fight on the plane!!! I am glad I had the wrong assumption! This looks so much fun, love it!!!”
“Good speed. Great form,” Southwest Airlines wrote Friday when it shared Villarreal‎’s video on its Facebook page. “These Passengers may have a future in professional toilet paper roll racing.”


Starting Monday, a Tesla Tiny House showcasing the company’s energy offerings will tour Australia. It will be towed by a Model X car and powered fully by renewable energy and show how the company’s Powerwall and solar tiles can power an entire home.
“We want to bring the Tesla Tiny House to you, so you can fully experience what it means to be self-powered. Our next stop could be in your town, tell us where you'd like to see us,” the company stated on its website.
The Tesla Tiny House is an endeavor by the company to educate the public on generating, storing and using renewable energy for homes.
The Tiny House weighs 2 tonnes and measures 6 meters x 2.2 meters x 4 meters. It gets 2 kilowatts of energy from a system of 6 panels using a single Tesla Powerwall unit. The exterior of the house is made with locally sourced, chemical free sustainable timber. The interior comprises of a design studio and a configurator, which will let customers calculate their home needs. The Tiny House will also have Tesla staff at hand to answer questions.
It already has a booked schedule, which includes the Australian cities of Melbourne, Brisbane and Sydney.
A Tesla spokesperson told Electrek Sunday, “The tour is designed to provide a one-on-one educational experience on how to integrate Powerwall and solar to seamlessly power an entire home 24/7, allowing Australian consumers to gain control and understanding of their power use.”
But, why is this product showcase touring Australia and not the United States, the prime market for Tesla products? The company has not explained this yet. But, chances are Tesla is targeting Australia since it has the world’s largest penetration of rooftop solar power with 15 percent of the 1.5 million households.
Tesla has just started showcasing its offerings and isn’t yet offering its products in Australia since, SolarCity, which it acquired last year only provided its services in U.S. and Mexico. The possibility is that depending on demand, Tesla may soon start offering solar installations in Australia.
The company is also setting up commercial offerings in Australia and is in the process of setting up a 100 megawatts/129 megawatt-hours energy storage. The facility, set up in South Australia will be the world's largest lithium-ion facility. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has promised to deliver a large-scale Powerpack system to the government of South Australia in 100 days or make it free.
Tesla has been diversifying into markets other than the U.S. for a long time and given the present administration’s stance on renewable energy, it makes sense for the company to do so.
The company revealed plans to set up Gigafactories in China and Europe in its earnings call on Aug. 3. The company has also set up an increased focus on solar and will be powering all its Supercharging stations for its cars with solar energy.
Tesla’s solar technology has a large potential globally, with large countries such as India and China not just interested in producing solar energy but actively working towards its mass production.


DineEquity (NYSE:DIN), the parent company of Applebee’s and IHOP announced it would be closing up to 160 restaurants Thursday in a bid to shore up profits. It will also bring in a new chief. One of the reasons the company feels that its profits are down was a failed attempt to win over millennial diners.
“Over the past few years, the brand’s set out to reinvent Applebee’s as a modern bar and grill in overt pursuit of a more youthful and affluent demographic,” said John Cywinski, president of Applebee’s in a call with analysts this week. “(It was) a clear pendulum swing toward millennials.”
WATCH: American Airlines Flight Hit By Turbulence, Aisle Littered With Drinks, Food
DineEquity felt that by pushing so hard for a new millennial demographic, it alienated its “Middle America” core demographic.
“I think, in retrospect, we may have tried too hard to attract new guests. That left some of our fans shaking their heads, asking ‘What happened to Applebee’s?’” Patrick Lenow, a spokesman for DineEquity told the Washington Post Friday.
Applebee’s plans on returning its attention to “value-seekers” and “traditionalists.” The company wants to bring some older popular menu items and dump new ones such as a turkey sandwich with sriracha chile lime sauce, according to the Washington Post. Applebee’s wants to bring back all-you-can-eat specials and will focus on discounts like the “2 for $20” special.

In the second quarter this year, DineEquity pulled in $20.9 million, down from $26.4 million in the same quarter last year. Stephen P. Joyce will lead the company starting in September. Joyce previously was the CEO of Choice Hotels.
DineEquity aims to close around 135 Applebee’s locations and around 25 IHOP locations out of its 3,700 franchises. DineEquity hopes to close underperforming locations that possibly damage the brand and older locations. According to Grub Street Thursday, the company also seeks to open 20 to 30 new Applebee’s, mostly overseas, and 80 to 95 IHOP locations in the U.S. The new locations might help off set job losses from the closing. The company overall employs 28,000 people.


United Airlines came under fire once again this week as news broke that a 5-year-old Cavalier King Charles Spaniel named Lulu  died in the cargo hold on a flight from Houston to San Francisco. The family of the dog said the plane was held on the tarmac for two hours August 6, on which day temperatures reached  above 90 degrees in the city. In an exclusive interview with International Business Times, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) responded to the dog’s death.
“It’s tragic,” Daphna Nachminovitch, a PETA spokesperson, said of Lulu’s death. “Our hearts go out to the family and obviously the dog.”
Details of the dog’s cause of death remained unclear Saturday. However, Nachminovitch was quick to point to reports that named United Airlines as the most frequent offender in animal deaths on flights, which federal law requires carriers to report. Nachminovitch added, “The bottom line is that animals are not luggage, so we don’t want to see them put in cargo.”

PETA noted the importance of pet owners in educating themselves about what occurs while animals are being transported by airlines. In the case of Lulu, the Rasmussen family claimed the  animal was cleared for travel by a veterinarian before the trip. But the family couldn’t have accounted for the two-hour delay on the tarmac while their flight awaited departure from the George Bush Intercontinental Airport, at which time PETA said the dog should have been removed from the cargo hold.
“It’s really important for people to educate themselves on what’s happened in the past with airlines — on this dog’s tragic death, obviously, given that there was a delay,” Nachminovitch said. “The airline should have absolutely gotten the dog out of cargo without delay. A dog is not a suitcase.”
“In addition to the absolute terror of being in cargo and being handled like cargo, obviously conditions in cargo are not suitable for a living being,” she added. “There are a few airlines that have stopped offering that service and only offer in-cabin transport, and that is absolutely what we suggest people do. Cargo can mean the difference between life and death.”
Nachminovitch specifically addressed Lulu’s breed — one that has a snub nose — as being at high-risk in cargo holds as a result of its shorter air passages. She named pugs, boxers and other breeds with similar facial structures as being equally vulnerable in extreme weather conditions.
PETA acknowledged that there are size restrictions to animals that are able to enter airline cabins with their owners — perhaps with an exception being service animals — and that such restrictions may vary between carriers. But Nachminovitch noted that an alternative to flying an animal in cargo would be to leave the pet with a trustworthy guardian, or depending on the travel distance, to drive rather than fly.
United Airlines issued a public apology after news of the dog’s death and claimed that an internal review was underway.
“We are so sorry to learn of Lulu's passing and have reached out to our customer to offer our condolences and assistance,” the airline said in a statement issued to IBT. “We are deeply upset any time an animal suffers an injury while traveling with us and especially grieved in the rare instance that one passes away. We are conducting a thorough review of this incident.”
“The only effective way to keep animals safe is not to fly them in cargo — plain and simple,” Nachminovitch told IBT of United Airlines’ announcement of a “thorough review.” She pointed to the widely  publicized incident of a rabbit dying while being transported by United Airlines earlier this year as reason to be wary of any significant changes to its policies on animal handling.

“According to the statistics that are publicly available, [United Airlines appears] to be responsible for one-third of all animal deaths on U.S. flights in the last five years. And that’s a very, very high rate,” Nachminovitch said.
PETA estimated that 53 animals, excluding Lulu, died on flights between January 2012 and February 2017. A  report from the U.S. Department of Transportation issued in February found that United Airlines had the highest number of animal deaths during transport last year at nine. On its  website, the animal rights organization estimated that “more than 300 animals have died in cargo holds since 2005, including 74 on United flights.”
“The most important thing for people to know is this is not an isolated incident. This has happened frequently over the last few years. It will continue to happen,” said Nachminovitch. “Our advice to travelers is please don’t let the next death be your dog or your cat.”

A man who posted a picture of his grilled cheese lobster roll aboard an American Airlines flight later went viral after he wrote a scathing review about the quality of the dish. Travel blogger Ben Schlappig wrote a blog Thursday about the airline’s food, and American Airlines on Friday issued an apology and stated the food was “not up to our standards.”
In a piece on his travel blog One Mile at a Time, Schlappig wrote, “I’m actually being too generous with the title in calling it a ‘lobster roll.’ It was more like a ‘lobster’ ‘roll.’”

“I have low expectations of American’s catering,” he said. “Yes, even in business class on their ‘premium’ A321 transcon flights. But yesterday I was served what might just be the worst meal I’ve ever been offered in a premium cabin.”
He added, “I was a bit surprised to see a lobster roll on the business class menu between Los Angeles and New York. However, I saw it on the menu before my flight and figured I had to pre-order it, since I was very curious to see how good of a job they’d do preparing it.”

Schlappig went on to compare photographs of a lobster roll he ordered while flying in the Etihad Residence with a photograph of the dish he ordered while flying with American Airlines, which was reportedly described as a “lobster roll with sweet potato chips.”
Schlappig said that when the dish was delivered, he “thought there was a mistake.” He described the exchange on his blog:
“I’m sorry, I think there’s a mistake. I ordered the lobster roll.”“Yes, that’s it.”“This is the lobster roll?”“Yes.”
Website Flyer Talk on Twitter dubbed the dish “so gross it went viral.”

“Not that it’s the flight attendant’s fault, but she didn’t seem to have the slightest clue as to how that might be disappointing,” wrote Schlappig. “What was even worse was when I opened the sandwich. There was about as much lobster meat on the sandwich as you’d get in a tub of butter. It sort of tasted like they took soggy pieces of bread and then spread butter with tiny particles of lobster on it.”

Reached by International Business Times for comment regarding the incident, American Airlines said the food was “not up to our standards” and issued an apology to Schlappig.
“We apologize to Mr. Schlappig for his experience,” American Airlines told IBT. “During his flight, he was served the lobster grilled cheese with tomato soup instead of the lobster roll. The meal he was served is not up to our standards and we have shared his feedback with our teams for review.”

Hermetise, a high-end European skin care line, reportedly uses kopi luwak (aka cat poop) as a key ingredient in its skin care line, according to Refinery29. 
Hermetise's Kopi Luwak Anti-Pollution Oxygen Brightening Treatment promises to give consumers an age-defying face lift with its 3-step process, which doesn't come cheap. Those willing to invest in the product can purchase the three items individually at $1,660 each or pay $4,994 for all products in the treatment. What makes this treatment so expensive?

Kopi luwak is the most expensive coffee worldwide. The coffee's known benefits include skin firming, reduced inflammation and decreased redness. However, the creation process for this coffee is what makes it more of a rarity.
A Civet — an Asian cat-like mammal — poops out coffee cherries that are then harvested into kopi luwak. However, it's highly-valued in Indonesia because the animal is rare, rather than because of the taste of its fermented coffee. NPR reported in 2012 that the fermentation outcome somewhat resembles an "Oh Henry! bar," but they claim that it's "not even as rare as it used to be" because farmers have implemented unethical harvesting practices.
According to a press release Hermetise obtained by Bustle, "The Civet likes to eat cherry beans and while they love the taste, they are unable to break down the seed during digestion which produces a particular fermentation. When the Civet does his, 'business' what is left is newly fermented beans which farmers then collect, wash, dry, sort, and finally roast them into this expensive and extraordinary coffee."
Hermetise's treatment combines 24k gold, advanced oxygen and age-defying ingredients alongside its kopi luwak infusion to create what it describes as a strong age treatment. On the website, the brand claims the product is "designed to clear and protect skin from environmental pollutants by delivering potent film-forming, water-holding and soothing effects."

Reviews have been left for the treatment on the product's page and appeared to show that consumers believed the kopi luwak treatment is worth the investment. Feedback on the skin care line is viewable from January 2017 onward, with no reviews hitting below four stars.
"This is my go to skincare product for a smoother, younger looking skin," one customer wrote in the reviews section. "Massaging this gel into the skin is so satisfying and relaxing. It has great age defying properties. I totally love this product because my skin has never felt this younger and radiant.."
Another customer claimed they are getting their money's worth, saying, "I have been using the product for a month now and I love the way it made my skin feel. I feel good about the product using organic ingredients and the scent being subtle but pleasant."
A third reviewer added, "Kopi Luwak Anti-Pollution cream is the new discovery for me and I loved it. The product is the best thing I have ever used. Results appear after one week."
One reviewer claimed to have "deducted" a star for presentation. The customer wrote that the product was "good and effective too. However, I deducted one star because it makes my skin a little bit greasy. Also, the product packaging doesn't look good."
Hermetise isn't the first to create a beauty treatment with feces in it. According to a report from The Huffington Post in 2012, celebrities like Tom Cruise and Victoria Beckham have discovered benefits from receiving bird poop facials.
In a related creation, YouTuber Michelle Phan also showed her followers how to make face masks out of cat litter, which reportedly makes a difference in the clearness of one's complexion.

Newsweek is hosting a Structure Security event Sept. 26-27 in San Francisco. Photo: Newsweek Media Group  Most data turns out to have a greater value than the sum of the parts. There's a story about a global courier firm that said it saw a large drop off in its monthly orders at some point in 2007, not too long before the bottom fell out of the global economy. Traditional economic forecasting did not see an issue, but had there been some visibility into trade finance data at that time it would have shown many contracts had been cancelled, affording us some warning of what was ahead.
Macro-economic forecasters and statistical analysts know that trade data provides the most precise window into the global economy there is. Trade finance data has always been a notoriously opaque part in the supply chain, but we are now seeing end-to-end digitisation, as a multitude of banks and software providers test out trade/supply blockchains and other digital platforms.
Newsweek is hosting an AI and Data Science in Capital Markets conference on December 6-7 in New York.  Photo: NewsweekMediaGroup
Supply chains have traditionally transacted using antiquated processes and physical letters of credit, bills of lading and purchase orders. This is now being rapidly digitalised, making it easy to aggregate and also access.
Christian Lanng, CEO Tradeshift (a trade finance and supply chain solution working with HSBC and Santander), said: "Over the next two to five years we are going to see massive digitalisation of that global trade dataset. It's moving from offline to online. It also means you can trade on it in a whole different way, leverage it in different ways. You can use it for research and in other contexts."
Tradeshift supports over 100 different transacting types, like bills of lading, letters of credit, invoices, purchase orders and more. Lanng said one of the main reasons you are seeing lots of data aggregation is because of cloud computing, which has driven down the cost of the procedure. "All this is built on open powerful platforms. We have open APIs. We can build third party applications that can leverage this data."
Today there's whole industry that revolves around alternative data that can be cleaned and readied for use by alpha-hungry asset managers and hedge funds. But while a company like Visa has one of the most valuable datasets on the planet, it would never reveal transaction data about its customers. The same could be said about Maersk, which has at its fingertips a snapshot of more than half the world's supply chains.
So while the platforming of supply chains and the use of shared ledgers will undoubtedly make this data more immediate and more granular – the question is will it ultimately become more accessible?
Tony Nash, CEO at data analytics firm Complete Intelligence, says trade datasets are a very good proxy of global supply/demand, but trade finance remains a missing piece.
"Trade lets us know exactly what's happening on supply chains, you know exactly what's happening with finished goods. The problem with trade finance today is that there is huge amount of opacity. Individual banks and trade finance firms aren't really that willing to surrender their trade finance data, so anything around trade finance that's public is really estimated.
"I think blockchain will bring some transparency to trade finance and actual aggregate values, and will do it in a much more real time sense. A lot of this information is so far delayed that you don't really know what's going on."
"There isn't a global source for this stuff. We've got goods data; we've got some services data, and all this currency commodity macro data. Trade finance adds a very interesting layer in terms of the timing of impacts and how they impact the cyclical nature of trade."
Those who follow the enterprise blockchain space know that data privacy is sine qua non – as much between participant banks running nodes as anyone else. Professional data collection and curation players are well aware of this fact. But they see the potential and are watching the space closely.
Tammer Kamel, CEO of Quandl, a well-known provider of data insights to the asset management industry, said: "Almost all our hedge fund customers covet supply chain insights. While Quandl has some data now that illuminates part of the picture, gaps remain. Blockchain adoption could well be what throws more light on things.
"That said, most supply chain participants have strong incentives to keep the details of their business operations confidential. In this space, as in others, we are watching blockchain adoptions closely to see what powerful data will emerge as the by-product."
Blockchain technology is very much in the offing and there are likely to be many variations in design as different use cases are fully explored. Amber Baldet, blockchain programme lead at JP Morgan, has overseen the creation of an extremely security-conscious modification of the Ethereum public blockchain called Quorum, which is aimed at enterprise uses. However, she said some blockchain uses – and she used global trade as an example – will likely see lots of value in the future by being spread across very large networks of users.
"Everybody is looking at supply chain on blockchain. If you only want to internalise receivables flows or letters of credit – markets between a relatively small number of banks – then you are fine using an enterprise blockchain solution purpose built for a small group of semi-trusted parties," said Baldet.
"But if you think that over time you want to add thousands or millions of end point suppliers to this thing; not only corporates, but perhaps actual vendors making fabrics and very little shops ... any sufficiently adopted sort of permissioned chain starts to look a lot more like a public chain."
This type of blockchain, while not open to the entire world, might become so adopted that we will gradually see security/utility trade-offs. At some point this seems to bleed into the old internet/intranet argument often invoked by opponents of private blockchains.
Jeremy Epstein, CEO of Never Stop Marketing has spent some time thinking about the intersection of big data and blockchains and how this might play out. He sees this phase of blockchain construction as similar to the big excitement in the late 90s around corporate intranets. "Over time, there will be a realisation that the real value is in permissionless, or the internet version of the blockchain. I think what you'll start to see is new supply chains that are being built around these sort of public blockchains," said Epstein.
He pointed out that companies like Google and Facebook lead the way in artificial intelligence and machine learning at the moment partly because they have access to the most data. But that might change with a more open, decentralised internet.
"In the short term, big companies with massive amounts of data are going to have an advantage. But I think eventually we will see the value of the public blockchain; the ease of innovation on top of it, that's the real differentiator.
"Collaboration is going to happen as more and more of these small players start jumping on, creating nodes and micro-niche apps. It could be a Kenyan coffee supply chain node on this global coffee supply chain.
"Big companies can't innovate at the micro level because there it's not valuable or profitable for them. But some entrepreneur in Nairobi can. And all of a sudden the data on public blockchains starts exploding. So if I'm going to analyse what's happening in the global coffee market, I can look at this public blockchain; I can put my AI and machine learning algorithms on top of it," he said.
"The more data wins, and eventually there's going to be more data in the public blockchains. No private organisation or even private ecosystem is going to be able to compete with billions of people."


When SpaceX’s latest cargo mission to the International Space Station (ISS) lifts off Monday, among the rest of its payload will be something that has possible ramifications for future long-term space travel: an experiment to design computers that are resistant, if not immune, to the effects of radiation in space.
Called Spaceborne Computer (SBC), the year-long experiment is a joint effort between NASA and Hewlett Packard Enterprise. It is a supercomputer which HPE has developed for the space agency “to run a high-performance commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) computer system in space,” according to a statement the company sent to International Business Times. “The goal is for the system to operate seamlessly in the harsh conditions of space for one year – roughly the amount of time it will take to travel to Mars,” it added.
This kind of an experiment is important because “radiation is likely to have a number of unanticipated effects on complex computer systems. This experiment helps identify critical failure points in electronic systems, as well as potential software ‘patches’ that can prevent them,” according to NASA. Closer home, it has potential applications on Earth as well, where radiation events like solar flares can endanger computer systems.

On its website, NASA said the experiment will help devise ways to use software to protect the computers aboard ISS and future spacecraft without the need for bulky, expensive shielding for protection from radiation.
“One of the goals of the experiment is to find a set of software parameters that allow the COTS supercomputer to continue to function and produce correct results in the harsh environment of space.  To clarify, nothing at all has been modified with any of the hardware or the open-source operating software.  In order to HARDen with software, several layers of detection, correction, and protection have been created.  Success would be a set of software parameters that produce correct results for a year,” Mark Fernandez, Americas Technology Officer of SGI at HPE, told IBT.
In essence, the experiment will involve the SBC running data-intensive applications, while power consumption is monitored and dynamically tuned. And this will be done on not one but four identical machines, two of which will operate on the ISS and the other two in HPE engineering laboratories in Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin, serving as control samples.
After a year on board the ISS, SBC-1 and SBC-2 will return to Earth, where they will be compared with the two Earth-based Computers.
“We then will do the typical failure analysis on Earth that we do with all failed and returned systems.  Maybe an engineering change would prevent such a failure.  Maybe it was a specific vendor and we need to tighten specifications.  All the usual things we do/learn from failed systems in order to make them more reliable in the future. These changes will affect not only space systems but all of the Earth-based systems from HPE,” Fernandez said.

The four super-computers use “2-socket ‘pizza-box’ servers from the HPE Apollo 40 family with Broadwell class processors and a high-speed 56 Gigabit per second interconnect. With a speed of over 1 TeraFLOP, while it's not going to give serious competition to the world’s fastest supercomputer, this really is a supercomputer,” he added, providing the specifications of the machines.
According to NASA, the systems are likely to generate about 5.4 MB of data every day, which will be stored on the solid state disks in the systems. However, the space agency added it was “desirable to download these files daily for safekeeping and analysis.”
Eng Lim Goh of HPE is the principal investigator for the project. It will be sent to the ISS on a SpaceX Dragon spacecraft that is scheduled to take off Aug. 14, aboard a Falcon 9 rocket, from Cape Canaveral, Florida. And this is just the first phase of this experiment, HPE said in its statement.
“Future phases of this experiment will eventually involve sending other new technologies and advanced computing systems, like Memory-DrivenComputing, to the ISS, once we learn more about how the Spaceborne Computer reacts in space. If astronauts are going to make it to Mars one day, they’re going to need the most sophisticated computing system possible at their disposal and we will continue to work towards that,” the company said.


A biography on Elon Musk, the billionaire entrepreneur who runs Tesla and SpaceX, was published in 2015 but seemingly, the man has only just read a copy (or maybe he read it earlier but was provoked now by a Business Insider tweet). And while he called the book “mostly correct,” Musk took issue with some of the anecdotes in it, particularly its depiction of how he parted ways with his long-time assistant Mary Beth Brown.
Titled “Elon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX, and the Quest for a Fantastic Future,” the biography was written by Ashlee Vance, a business columnist. In the book, Vance said Musk gave his assistant a two-week leave when she asked him for a significant raise, during which time he would assess the nature of her duties. When she returned, Musk told her she was no longer needed, gave her 12 months’ salary as severance package and never spoke to her again. According to the book, Musk offered her another job at the company (SpaceX), but she never returned to the office again.
TRENDING: Apples Postpones September Launch Of iPhone 8
In a series of tweets Thursday night, Musk contested this version of events, calling this one “of all the bogus anecdotes” in the book, the one that “troubles” him the most.




While the barrage of tweets began as a reply to a Business Insider story, Musk also took a shot at TIME for writing a story based on the same anecdote.

Maye Musk, Elon’s mother, got into the fray as well, agreeing with her son and calling some of the book’s contents “glaringly wrong.”

Soon after the book was first published, Musk’s ex-wife Justine Musk wrote about an incident between her and Musk, and without taking sides, compared it with the alleged way in which Mary Beth was fired.
“This reminds me of something similar he once said to me, many years ago, after I came back from a week's visit with my family in Canada -- that his life had operated quite smoothly in my absence.  He was letting me know that I was an incompetent house manager. (He was not wrong.)  So of the different stories I have heard behind MB's departure from SpaceX, this is the one that resonates with me. (Although you would *never* use the word 'incompetent' in association with MB!),” she wrote on Quora.
But it wasn’t all seriousness. Musk made light of some other anecdotes he said were wrongly presented in the book.


POPULAR NOW: Video Shows Stingray Eating A Squid
And when someone asked him what he saw himself as, if not a ninja, his reply implied that among his other talents, Musk is perhaps good at tailoring too.

Another Twitter user asked him if there was a list of “bogus anecdotes” from his biography.

Someone else then asked Musk about updates to his latest venture, the Boring Company that plans to drill tunnels in urban areas to speed up public transport.

With the Tesla Model 3 just rolled out, an upcoming Falcon 9 launch Monday that will carry a Dragon resupply mission to the International Space Station, and the first Falcon Heavy test scheduled for November, Musk has a lot to keep him occupied while he waits for Godot.


A Chipotle Mexican Grill restaurant in downtown Dallas temporarily closed Tuesday after mice were spotted. The mice managed to crawl through a hole in the wall of the 100-year-old building. 
The closure announcement comes on the heels of video footage of the rodent sighting went viral after a Chipotle customer posted it on Twitter. However, the announcement didn't emerge until three weeks after the incident.

Quinn Kelsey, communications and public relations manager for Chipotle, issued a statement Thursday to International Business Times about the closing. Chipotle, which has over 2,200 locations, plans to investigate the construction of the building.
"We have temporarily closed the Chipotle restaurant in Dallas’ historic West End District at 208 North Market Street so we can continue to thoroughly assess the construction of this 100-year-old building," Kelsey told IBT. "Employees have been given the option to relocate to nearby Chipotle locations while our teams are evaluating the building.
"We regret any inconvenience and will reopen only when we are certain the building meets all Chipotle standards for operation."
According to the Dallas Morning News, management had removed the rodents from the restaurant. A crew of professional were also recruited to help repair the hole the rodents entered the Chipotle through.

A representative of Chipotle responded to Koslei's friends' tweet, saying, "That's concerning. Please contact http://chipotle.com/email-us."
The video footage went viral the day after the post was published on Twitter. Mice in the video are seen moving past a table, crawling up a wall and a third was laying motionless on its side.
The Denver-based company, which was founded in 1993, has come under fire for health code issues, most notably for an E. coli outbreak in 2015.
After the outbreak, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced plans to investigate in  a statement.
"The FDA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) along with state and local officials are investigating two separate outbreaks of E. coli O26 infections that have been linked to food served at Chipotle Mexican Grill restaurants in several states."
Chipotle reportedly closed 43 restaurants in Washington and Oregon after news broke of the initial outbreak.
A norovirus outbreak also plagued the fast food chain in July, which CNN reported that a sick employee was responsible for spreading the infection at a Virginia location.
Small Business Trends reported in July that the outbreak provided a "PR nightmare" that "is far from over."

In an incident that was still being investigated Wednesday, a toilet flush at Orlando International Airport in Florida over the weekend reportedly delayed thousands of travelers. Reports stated that an individual attempted to flush items down the toilet, which caused a backup and subsequent sewage leak.
Carpets were pulled up and a hazmat team was called in to deal with flooding. The  Orlando Sentinel reported Wednesday that normal operations had resumed Tuesday after days of delayed travel. Officials reportedly found that the items flushed included clothing and packets of paper towels.

Officials said the incident may have occurred after an individual in the international arrivals area of Terminal 1 attempted to flush the contents of a suitcase, ABC affiliate  WFTV reported Wednesday. According to the local station, “The flooding caused passengers flying into Orlando from outside the country to be bused to a customs area on the opposite side of the airport Saturday, Sunday and Monday,” with the aftermath affecting thousands of travelers.

“It was certainly an inconvenience to some, but we moved very quickly,” airport spokeswoman Carolyn Fennell told the Orlando Sentinel. She added that some airplanes that were scheduled to arrive at the terminal were able to be rerouted to other gates to minimize travel delays.
Speaking with WFTV, witness Mike Ortiz said he was held on the tarmac while the incident was being investigated.
“As soon as we landed, they immediately told us that there were problems with the terminal and we would have to sit there on the tarmac for a while,” he said. “There were carpets ripped up and there were floor fans trying to air out what was, I guess, some flooding going on.”

BMO Capital Markets, a financial services firm, downgraded Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX) shares from outperform to market perform Wednesday after its research showed that there were too many Starbucks. There are, on average, over three Starbucks in a one-mile radius of every other Starbucks.
“Cannibalization likely has increased,” wrote BMO analyst Andrew Strelzik in the company’s analysis. “Strong new store performance appears to be coming — at least in part — at the expense of existing store traffic.”
WATCH: 'Heroic' Customer Tackles Armed Robber At Starbucks
Starbucks opened 650 U.S. stores in the fiscal year 2016. BMO feels that the high number Starbucks locations in a given area are hurting each other’s sales. BMO’s analysis suggests that the pace of U.S. development should slow down.
“Seventy-five percent of Starbucks locations in California now have a store within a one-mile radius,” Strelzik told CNBC Wednesday. “There are now 3.6 Starbucks locations within a one-mile radius of the typical Starbucks in the U.S. relative to 3.3 and 3.2 stores in 2014 and 2012 respectively.”
California represents Starbucks’ largest market accounting for 20 percent of its U.S. stores. In New York, there is an average of 23.5 Starbucks within a one-mile radius of any given Starbucks.
Starbucks, however, said in an investor conference call in July that it feels that it isn’t facing cannibalization from oversaturation.
“We're able to track quite accurately the cannibalization results that happened from those new stores, and what we've seen over many years is very, very little impact of net new cannibalization of those new stores,” said Scott Harlan Maw, the company’s chief financial officer.
BMO research lowered its 12-month stock price target to $56 from $64. Starbuck shares fell 1.6 percent on Wednesday after the downgrade.

“Starbucks continues to produce record financial and operating results quarter after quarter, and open a new class of over 2,000 stores around the world every year, that continue to outperform competitors and deliver industry-leading …profit, starting virtually from the day they open their doors,” Starbucks spokesperson Reggie Borges told Business Insider Wednesday. “Clearly we believe that there's still a long runway for growth for new stores in the U.S. and globally.”
Starbucks currently has 13,612 stores in the U.S. and Puerto Rico. The coffee chain had to close around 600 underperforming stores in 2008 after adding almost 10,000 U.S. stores that year.


A new Cheetos restaurant is underway in New York City with help from Food Network chef Anne Burrell, according to reports. The Spotted Cheetah, an obvious reference to Cheetos mascot Chester Cheetah, is slated to whip up Cheetos-inspired dishes when it opens between Aug. 15-17 as NYC Restaurant Week comes to a close. 
Fans of the Frito Lay brand have cultivated their own versions of Cheetos-inspired foods for the digital web, including DIY Mac'n Cheetos and Hot Cheetos Tacos. However, The Spotted Cheetah will be the first-ever restaurant that will reimagine the way Cheetos can be prepared, with dishes that include fried green tomatoes breaded with a white cheddar Cheetos crust and Cheetos mix-ups crusted Chicken Milanese.

In a press release, Burrell proclaimed her excitement for cultivating unique recipes centering around the popular cheese-flavored chip.
"As a long-time Cheetos fan, I'm thrilled to join forces with a snack brand that is truly an iconic American staple. I had so much fun curating this specially crafted, one-of-a-kind menu for the first Cheetos restaurant – I can't wait to see guests' reactions!"
The three-course menu at the 211 W. Broadway location features items between $8 to $22. The 11 Cheetos-inspired dishes will also boast popular Cheetos flavors: Cheesy, Flamin' Hot, Cheddar Jalapeño, Flamin' Hot Limón and others. 
The restaurant's menu will bring familiar food items to a Cheetos dust finish. Cheetos Crusted Fried Pickles with Creamy Ranch, Flamin’ Hot Limón Chicken Tacos, Cheetos Meatballs and Cheetos Sweetos Crusted Cheesecake are a few of the items slated to hit the menu. Pictures of what fans can expect from the restaurant's original recipes can be found here.

"Our fans have inspired us with their creativity and playfulness. We’ve seen their love for Cheetos exhibited through innovative dishes, desserts and beverages, which motivated us to create a restaurant that would bring a full Cheetos culinary experience to life," Ryan Matiyow, senior director of marketing for Frito-Lay, said in a press release. "The Spotted Cheetah is a fun and delicious way for Cheetos to celebrate a variety of favorite flavors in an upscale and playful culinary setting that will wow our guests."
Burrell, 47, has worked with some of the top restaurants in New York City. Her trademark spiky blond hair may be familiar to television audiences who have seen her appear on Food Network’s "Iron Chef America" and as a judge on "Beat Bobby Flay."
While Cheetos may not be a restaurant staple yet, Burrell's creation could change that. Devoted Cheetos fans are on board for the journey, with several individuals taking to social media to show their support.
Free Beacon's Executive Editor Sonny Bunch shared his excitement for The Spotted Cheetah on Twitter, saying, "Things I want to do before I die in a nuclear explosion: 1. Visit the Cheetos restaurant. End of list. I've lived a full life."
Another user tweeted, "none of my friends wanna go to the cheetos pop-up restaurant with me next week and i've never felt so betrayed."
A third user wrote in a tweet, "A Cheetos-themed restaurant is opening in New York City this weekend. I already have a reservation. It's about them using Cheetos."

Reality star and beauty mogul Kylie Jenner situated herself as a force in the makeup market, with her lip kits reportedly bringing in millions of dollars since their initial launch in 2015. But the figure may be significantly higher than previously estimated, as famous Kardashian momager Kris Jenner revealed retail sales of Kylie Cosmetics products to be at $420 million in just 18 months on the market.

The figure was revealed to WWD in an interview with Kris Jenner at her Los Angeles home last week and was published Tuesday. WWD called it “the first time the Jenners have disclosed the scale of Kylie’s business,” and Kris Jenner reportedly provided “documentation” to support the claim. Comparing Kylie Cosmetics with other industry leading brands, WWD pointed out the significance of the brand’s swift rise to the top:
“For perspective, the Estée Lauder Cos. Inc.-owned Tom Ford Beauty was said to have reached revenues of $500 million after a decade, and the brand is considered to be one of the two fastest growing in Lauder’s portfolio, along with Jo Malone. Bobbi Brown, also part of the Lauder stable, took 25 years to reach the billion-dollar mark in 2016, with L’Oréal’s Lancôme finally hitting the milestone in 2015 after 80 years.”
The 19-year-old’s many successful entrepreneurial endeavors — including clothing lines, brand endorsements and multiple reality TV shows to which she’s currently tied — made her youngest person to land on Forbes’ list of  The World’s Highest-Paid Celebrities earlier this year. Kylie Jenner is estimated to have a  net worth of approximately $18, while her older sister Kim Kardashian has an estimated net worth of $51 million. Given the trajectory of the starlet’s businesses, Kylie Jenner could be well on her way to becoming the richest among her Kardashian sisters.

Kylie Jenner previously  spoke with Refinery 29 about the launch of her eponymous line of cosmetics and told the website that her love of lip kits and liners spurred her interest in starting a brand of her own.
“I’ve been obsessed with lipliners and lipsticks and I can’t leave the house without them, so probably just my obsession with it,” she said of founding Kylie Cosmetics.
“It’s all me and I literally went to the factories and sat with the chemists,” she continued. “There wasn’t really a struggle, it was just the waiting process [that was hard] and figuring out what exactly people would like and what would be on trend a few months later, but I just followed my heart I was sitting there. I would give them an idea of what I wanted, they would make it, then I would try it on and be like ‘Oh it needs more gray, or more pink.' Then they go back, make it right in front of my face. It was dope.”

Delta Air Lines removed passengers from a flight at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport Wednesday after two of the plane's tires deflated on the runway, according to ABC-affiliated station WSB-TV. 
Delta flight 5508 was preparing to depart the runway for Tulsa, Oklahoma when employees discovered the error. Airline employees evacuated passengers from the plane and had them hop on a bus to return to the terminal. All customers were placed onto a new flight.

Video obtained from the incident by WSB-TV showed that the local fire department had arrived at the scene to aid the situation. According to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, 46 passengers and four crew members were on flight 5508. However, no injuries or fatalities were sustained.
Lisa Hellerstedt — a representative from ExpressJet, which is a partner with Delta Air Lines — told International Business Times Wednesday that "maintenance is currently evaluating" what happened on Delta flight 5508. 
According to Fox affiliate WAGA-TV, Delta Air Lines released a statement Wednesday about the aborted flight at Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport, which illustrated how passengers "safely" departed the aircraft to board a new flight.
"ExpressJet flight 5508, operating as Delta Connection from Atlanta to Tulsa, aborted takeoff at approximately 9:22 a.m. ET at Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport after two tires deflated," the statement read.

The statement continued, "Passengers were safely deplaned through the main cabin door and transported back to the terminal on buses as maintenance crews work to tow the plane off the runway. Passengers have been accommodated on another aircraft that will continue on to the original destination."
A spokesperson from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued a statement Wednesday to IBT about Delta flight 5508. The FAA plans to launch an investigation into the incident.  
"ExpressJet 5508, a CRJ 900 aircraft, cancelled takeoff from Runway 8 Right at Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport after the crew reported a blown tire," FAA told IBT. "Passengers deplaned via stairs and were bussed to the terminal...The FAA is investigating."
According to 2016 report Wired, airplane tires rarely have issues because of its durability. Wired reported that "The typical airliner tire can handle a 38-ton load. It can meet the ground 500 times before needing a re-tread, a refresh it can take on seven times in its life." However, Delta Air Lines has been plagued with problematic tires before, which includes video footage that surfaced in June 2011 and May 2013 of a Delta flights that experienced a tire blow out during takeoff.

Blackwater founder Erik Prince, the brother of Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, has been promoting a plan in major media outlets to turn the war in Afghanistan over to private military contractors. But largely missing from the debate about Prince’s plan is that the former Blackwater CEO currently leads a military contractor that would profit from the proposal and enrich its shareholders — which include the Chinese government.
Prince made his pitch to the American people Monday with an  op-ed in USA Today and an extended one-on-one interview with host Erin Burnett on CNN.
Read: Betsy DeVos Invested In Military Tech Contractor Run By Son-In-Law, While Brother Shaped Afghan War Policy
Both USA Today and CNN named Prince’s current company, Frontier Services Group (FSG) — unlike the Wall Street Journal,  which ran a Prince op-ed pushing his plan in May with a one-sentence bio that failed to mention his current position — but neither outlet mentioned that FSG is a security contractor partially owned by the Chinese government.

Prince’s proposal is to win the war in Afghanistan through privatization of the military effort there, but it’s also a sales pitch for the services of his industry and his company. FSG has openly allied itself with the foreign policy goals of the Chinese government and has pursued the creation of a private air force — the same type of air force Prince advocates in his plan.
That plan calls for 5,500 private contractors to advise Afghan combat forces. Prince wants to make those private security forces “military employees of the Afghan government,” he explained to CNN host Burnett on Monday. Current  Defense Department policy states that private security contractors cannot engage in combat, but can use deadly force in self-defense.
“Imagine them as a skeletal structure that provides leadership, intelligence, medical, communications and logistic support to all those Afghan battalions so it works reliably,” Prince said. He said the security forces that would be used in his plan could be foreign — like his company, which has its headquarters in Hong Kong and is traded on the Hong Kong stock exchange.
The private contractors he wants to deploy to Afghanistan “could be Americans,” he said.
“They could be foreign nationals. They could be NATO allies. They can be from the global SAF community of professionals,” Prince told CNN, using the acronym for Security Assistance Forces (SAF).
The private contractors could potentially be from the company Prince leads. Prince became the  chairman of FSG in 2014, and he’s currently its largest shareholder,  according to the company’s 2016 annual report. Another substantial shareholder is CITIC Group, a state-owned Chinese conglomerate.
FSG markets itself as a logistics provider in Africa and South Asia, but it also builds  military bases, provides  “security solutions” in war zones and, according  to a report by the Intercept, was, through Prince’s clandestine efforts, trying to build a private air force.   
While Prince is a former American servicemember (he was a Navy SEAL), his company is working to help  China achieve one of its most important foreign policy goals: the “One Belt One Road” initiative, which is an ambitious plan to link China to Europe through  $5 trillion  in infrastructure investment in more than 60 countries.

“2016 saw FSG take substantive steps to grow in existing markets as well as aligning our strategy to better serve China’s One Belt One Road development policy,” Prince wrote in his  most recent annual letter to shareholders, dated March 22, 2017. Looking forward to 2017, Prince wrote, “we are looking forward to extending our work along the One Belt One Road region. Our aircraft reach can extend air operations, medevac and air cargo on demand through the entire region.”
Afghanistan is a critical part of the One Belt One Road plan, which is why Bloomberg reported last year that China was  the number one investor in Afghanistan.
“Without Afghan connectivity, there is no way to connect China with rest of world,” Chinese ambassador to Afghanistan Yao Jing said in a speech given at the completion of a Chinese-built rail route in Afghanistan last year.
Reports have indicated China’s military, which  has expansive mineral and oil rights in Afghanistan, is conducting  joint operations with Afghan troops inside the country.
Prince “rejects criticism that he and others would profit” from the plan, USA Today reported, instead saying his plan would “represent a cost savings for American taxpayers.” Earlier this year, he told the Financial Times his company was “not serving Chinese foreign policy goals, we’re helping to increase trade.” 
The White House is reportedly “considering” Prince’s plan. The proposal does not  appear likely to become U.S. strategy anytime soon, although the non-military members of the Donald Trump administration seem especially keen on it. Trump Senior Adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner, along with chief strategist Steve Bannon, who hosted  Prince regularly on his Breitbart radio show, reached out to Prince about the proposal. In July, Bannon presented Prince’s ideas to Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, who decided to leave the plan out of a review of the U.S. military’s policy in Afghanistan, the  New York Times reported.
Prince said on CNN that his discussions with White House staff occurred because President Trump read his Wall Street Journal op-ed and wanted to know more. The two have a history (apart from their mutual connection to Betsy DeVos): Prince donated  $100,000 to a pro-Trump super PAC last year and met with the president during the transition,  according to Bloomberg. The Washington Post reported that Prince tried to  establish a Trump-Putin back channel in January, just days before Trump took office.

Prince rose to fame after starting and leading Blackwater, the private security force that changed its name —  twice — apparently to avoid the negative publicity associated with allegations of misconduct. Those allegations included the conviction of former guards on murder and manslaughter charges in U.S. courts for  killing 14 unarmed civilians in Baghdad in 2007, convictions which just last week were tossed by  a federal appeals court. Blackwater agreed to pay  $42 million in fines to the State Department for export violations, which included illegal weapons exports to Afghanistan. Prince left Blackwater in 2009.
In addition to calling for more private security contractors in Afghanistan, Prince is advocating a 90-plane private air force that would “provide air support... against Taliban insurgents,”  USA Today reported. Prince explained his emphasis on air support on CNN Monday.
“[Afghan military forces] need air power. Less than 40 percent of the U.S.-provided air power to the Afghan forces still even functions, because the maintenance and training has been such a failure,” Prince said.
His own company could provide that air power: He recently submitted a business proposal to the Afghan military to set up a private air force, the  Military Times reported last week. Prince has been pursuing the idea for some time, according to  the Intercept.
The Intercept last year documented the billionaire’s efforts to circumvent laws around exporting weapons by fitting agricultural aircraft with surveillance and weapons technology and sending them to clients in Africa. Austrian company Airborne Technologies, which Prince had a 25 percent stake in at the time, made the modifications, the Intercept reported.


A Kazakhstan-based travel company stirred controversy last week after releasing an ad spot featuring naked women posing as flight attendants. The ad for Chocotravel quickly went viral, with critics on social media calling it out for apparent sexism. The company responded to the ad's mixed reviews in a statement to International Business Times.

The ad — which was uploaded to several social media outlets that included Facebook and YouTube — prominently featured the exposed bodies of several models, who wore only caps and scarves standard to the uniforms often worn by stewardesses. Their breasts were obscured by a search bar that stretched the length of the frame while they covered their lower abdomens with their hats. A similar video was also released with nude men posing as pilots, though the latter received far less outrage. A caption on both videos promised “the service of buying air tickets without extra charges!”

A spokesperson for Chocotravel issued a statement to IBT in response to the controversy.
“Our business is online and we believe that our customers are advanced users,” Nikolay Mazentsev, Chocotravel's ticketing service director, told IBT. “The main goal of our ad campaign was to raise awareness over significant fees on airline tickets. We did not want to offend anyone. We tried to play on the association of ticket price without markups with naked men and women, where naked = no markup. At all times pilots and stewardesses were considered to be symbols of beauty, grace and attractiveness, that is why we decided to make to commercials with males and females.”
Mazentsev said the company intended to use paid advertising to reach broader audiences with both videos but decided against it after the video managed to go viral organically after Nurken Rzaliyev, an employee of Chocotravel’s parent company Chocofamily, shared it August 3 on Facebook. Mazentsev seemed to be unphased by backlash to the video, instead noting “top international mass media wrote about the controversy it created.”

Rzaliyev issued his own response to critics in an  interview with AdWeek Friday.
“There’s definitely no sexism,” Rzaliyev said. “Opinions were divided, but attention was made to the problem of high ticket prices.”
The video posted to Rzaliyev’s Facebook page had amassed more than 21,000 views as of Wednesday afternoon. On the company’s YouTube account, the video had well over a million views and hundreds of comments.

If you follow the news in the crypto space – Bitcoin divided, Parity wallets hacked – it's not surprising the recent Tezos fundraiser attracted so much attention. Tezos is a smart contract blockchain platform created by Arthur and Kathleen Breitman, which recently raised $232m (£177.9m, €196.9m).
It's worth remembering two key problems Tezos sets out to solve. It presents a way to carry out decentralised upgrades to its protocol via an on-chain voting system, addressing the governance problem inherent to decentralised systems and the likelihood of contentious forking scenarios. It also proposes a more restrictive programming model for writing smart contracts, so their behaviour will be more predictable and more easily formally analysed.

The recent Parity bug was a reminder that even the most talented coders can make mistakes and smart contracts require formal methods of verification. "We had an eye from the beginning on formal verification and formal methods," said Arthur Breitman.
"Even if you're a great programmer bugs are going to happen, and the only way we can guard against this is by using formal methods: rigorous mathematical proofs that a program does what we want it to do."
"The most advanced proof assistant, Coq, is written in OCaml, the same language used to develop Tezos, so there are affinities between the two communities".
Tezos is also presenting a decentralised system that can deploy upgrades automatically, like in Chrome or Windows, "but instead of having the upgrades signed by your vendor – because there is no central vendor – the upgrade is, in some sense, signed by everyone who is using the protocol".
He made a clear distinction between the Tezos governance system and its proof of stake consensus. "To have a system like this you need to start with proof of stake [PoS] because proof of work creates a political class or miners whose interest may differ from token holders.
"But PoS, by itself, isn't sufficient for governance. There is a misconception that PoS consensus can be used as-is for governance.
"If you try to use consensus over chain branches as governance you end up with a kind of Keynesian beauty contest. You win if you follow the herd, and that doesn't have anything to do with merit. It doesn't have anything to do with what branch you prefer, it has to do with what branch you think is the Schelling point, the most natural one."
Arthur explained the Tezos governance system starts off with proposals, which anyone can make. They are then rated using approval voting. "Several proposals are made and people who own tokens indicate the ones they like and dislike.
"You then take the one with the highest approval rating and you submit it to another vote to pass it. Tezos requires something like a 70% majority in order to adopt a proposal, which then undergoes testing for a month. If the testing phase goes well, then a second confirmationvote is held before adoption."
"Crucially, there is no penalty if you support a version that doesn't end up winning."
He said this is only the very first layer, and the process will look to improve the governance model itself, as well as the ledger. For instance, some proposals and decisions that are not critical will not require a full referendum vote.
"You can have something like elected representatives making decisions over some narrow technical aspects of the ledger, for instance. So we can progressively build on that very simple governance layer, a more complex and better adapted governance structure."
Asked about the ICO, the team made the point that a high volume of tokens must be distributed in order to set up a wide proof of stake network. Co-founder Kathleen Breitman said: "Proof-of-stake lacks the elegant distribution that Bitcoin has. So the easiest way to bootstrap the network was this type of fundraiser, with the side benefit of endowing a non profit with funds that can help promote these technologies – in this case for quite some time."
She said it's important to distinguish this process from people who might be thinking about doing a Series B for their company and decide it's easier to just crowdfund it.
Arthur Breitman added that some people said it was irresponsible not to "cap" the funds raised. But to have done so would have meant the majority of tokens would have been snapped up by professional ICO scalpers looking only to make a quick arbitrage, rather than reaching a network of participants.
Arthur Breitman, co-founder and CTO of DLS, said: "When we started, a whole coterie of people in the space insisted there ought to be a cap on the fundraiser. Otherwise it's irresponsible they said, never exactly articulating a good reason why. They've made up this idea that some sort of self-imposed cap is a kind of duty, and attempt to back their argument with poorly understood business principles sprinkled with moralistic undertones. Not having a cap felt like crossing a picket line."
Breitman believes imposing a cap of, say, $5m when people want to contribute $50m turns the process into race whereby a professional industry of ICO scalpers grab all the tokens to book some 1,000% returns.
"The absurd practice of letting professional scalpers capture most of the value of these projects is basically killing analysis technical due diligence in the space. At best, it's often reduced to superficial indicators, like the number of stars on GitHub, instead of actually doing an in-depth analysis of the value proposition of a technology, or how well it's implemented."
Regarding the distribution of tokens across participants in the fundraiser, he said there were some 30,000 wallets created.
"The Gini coefficient, a statistical measure of disparity within a statistical sample, is about 0.87, similar to the Ethereum fundraiser, a bit higher than the distribution of wealth in the US – so it's not a surprising number."
In terms of next steps, Arthur said from technical standpoint there needs to be a few security audits, and the network needs to be polished ready for launch. "I think the path to doing that is very clear, whereas the path to growing Tezos into a much larger project is still a little new," he revealed.
Kathleen added: "We've been helping out the Foundation by reaching out to people who might be a good fit for the team and the ecosystem. The next three or four months you are probably going to hear a bit from the dev team, but the next month or so it will heads down and getting the right people at the table."


A gym in Atlanta has barred police officers and members of the military from entering the facility — and employed some vulgar language to do so. The EAV Barbell Club in East Atlanta hung a sign from its door that read “No f----- cops.”
The gym’s owner, Jim Chambers, stuck by the ban.
“We’ve had an explicitly stated ‘No cop’ policy since we opened,” Chambers told WXIA-TV. “We also don’t open membership to active members of the military.”
TRENDING: Video Shows Malia Obama Being Carted Out Of Lollapalooza In Chicago
Chambers identified himself as a “lifelong political activist” and said the sign represented a political statement. Chambers told WXIA that the people who typically work out at the gym were minorities who were “uncomfortable with the presence of law enforcement.”

Chambers took down the sign for now, but only because of the expletives. He said he’d be putting it back up with cleaner language and planned to still enforce the ban.
“It was really just that the vulgarity in that sign and that seems to bring it out for people,” he told WXIA. “I don’t want the other folks there to take the heat that I’m willing to take.”
The Atlanta Police Department said the policy would not deter its officers from doing their job.
“Were we to respond to an emergency there, this sign would not stop us from lawfully doing our job,” the department told WXIA.
Chambers, however, denied he or his patrons would ever need the police department’s services.
“If they have a warrant, they can go anywhere they want,” he said. “But we’re not breaking the law.”
EAV Barbell’s police ban echoed a similar incident that occurred in Brooklyn, New York last week when a Dunkin’ Donuts employee refused to service two police officers.
“I don’t serve cops,” the unidentified employee said, according to the New York Post.
The store was harshly criticized for the alleged behavior. Mayor Bill de Blasio and NYPD commissioner James O’Neill condemned the incident, while de Blasio called it “illegal” and “unacceptable.”

“I don’t know the details and I wasn’t there, but if it’s what you describe, it’s someone being stupid and unfair to our police officers,” de Blasio said.
The store’s manager later told Gothamist the situation was a “misunderstanding.”
“Our franchises are committed to serving each and every guest with respect and courtesy,” Dunkin’ Donuts said in a statement.


The controversy around the Google diversity memo is deepening, following the leak of a 10-page manifesto criticizing diversity initiatives in the company. More than 60 former and current female employees are expected to file a class-action lawsuit against the company over sexism and unequal pay, the Guardian reported Wednesday.
 Google has “a culture that is hostile to women,” James Feinberg, a civil rights attorney told The Guardian. Feinberg is working on a class-action suit on the behalf of the company’s female employees.
The scandal started with the leaked manifesto that argued men occupy more leading roles in the tech industry due to “biological differences” which prompted the company to fire the author. However, the document has once again ignited the controversy around discrimination towards women in the industry.
Read:    Video Shows Malia Obama Being Carted Out Of Lollapalooza In Chicago
Feinberg claimed several women he interviewed for the suit were paid around $40,000 less on an average for doing the same work as men. He also stated that more than 12 women claimed that the pay disparity played a role in their decision to leave the company.
He claimed that men get higher initial salaries and stock offerings and this disparity increases over time.
Google, however, claims otherwise,” “Sixty people is a really small sample size. There are always going to be differences in salary based on location, role, and performance, but the process is blind to gender,” a company spokesperson told the Guardian.
But, despite what the spokesperson said, there is a one in 100 million chance that the discrimination is occurring randomly or by chance, Janice Madden, a University of Pennsylvania professor of sociology said.
The proposed class-action suit comes in addition to a case brought by the U.S. Department of Labor (DoL) which argued in April that the company was systemically discriminating against women. That investment isn’t yet complete, but the results aren’t promising for Google. The company has been forced to hand over its salary records in that case to a judge.
Janet Herold, the regional solicitor for the DoL, said at the time: “The government’s analysis at this point indicates that discrimination against women in Google is quite extreme, even in this industry. “
Read:    WATCH: Suspected Cartel Gunmen Open Fire At Tourists In Mexico Beach
When it comes to sexism, Google isn’t the only culprit. The tech industry does not have its hands clean when it comes to sexism. A survey done in May by the job website Hired found that on average, women were offered 4 percent less pay than men, with some companies even offering 50 percent less as compared to their male colleagues. The largest pay gap was between white men and black women in tech — for every $1 a white man made, a black woman made $0.79.
“The problem with women and tech right now is not that women aren’t going into computing. It's that they don't stay. And the reason they don’t stay is that it's largely an unpleasant environment to work in [for women]. That’s why it's so important [to note] that this is a field that started out with women and becomes male, not the other way around,” Nathan Ensmenger, an expert on the history of computing at Indiana University told the Time Magazine on Tuesday.


A toddler in Orlando, Florida died Tuesday after being left behind in a hot day care van for almost 12 hours, according to The Washington Post. The 3-year-old was discovered dead late Monday evening after the driver reportedly failed to do a headcount and determine the boy was left behind. 
The child, Myles K. Hill, didn't get out of the vehicle when it arrived at his day care facility at Little Miracles Academy on Monday. He was found unresponsive in the day care's van Monday night, which prompted the day care to alert the police.

The Orlando Police Department (OPD) held a press conference to discuss the incident that Police Chief John Mina deemed to be a "tragedy."
"We were called to Little Miracles Academy — 900 Plymouth — in reference to an unresponsive child. Tragically, one of our officers arrived. They found that 3-year-old Myles Hill had died," Mina said.
"Our initial investigation revealed that the day care worker picked up Myles and other kids in intent to drive them to the other Little Miracles Academy on 2514 West Colonial Drive," he continued. "She returned to the day care center on Plymouth and did not realize Myles was still in the van." 
Hall was supposed to be dropped off at his grandmother's house Monday night, but he never arrived. Hall's grandmother later called local law enforcement, and the OPD launched a missing child investigation. She also alerted Little Miracles Academy of her grandson's absence, which led the day care staff to check the van and discover Hall's unresponsive body.   
"This is an absolute tragedy that could have been prevented. If confirmed by the autopsy, Myles would be the thirty-second child that has died while being left in a hot vehicle this year and the fifth in the state of Florida," Mina concluded. "I just wanted to take a moment to plead with every single parent, caregiver, babysitter, brother, sister [or] whoever please make sure that we are checking our vehicles for our kids. It just takes a minute." 
TRENDING: Video Shows Malia Obama Being Carted Out Of Lollapalooza In Chicago
The OPD is waiting for the results from Hall's autopsy to determine his cause of death, but it's believed that Hall was left in the hot vehicle since 9:00 a.m. EDT.  Hill would have been 4 years old later in August. A vigil was held in his honor Tuesday at the day care center.
Criminal charges for the day worker at fault are still pending, but the OPD claims that she has been "very cooperative" throughout this process. The Florida Department of Children and Families are also conducting their own separate investigation into the incident. The day care driver's identity has not been revealed to the public at this time.
This isn't the first time Little Miracles has come under fire for allegations of trouble keeping track of children through its transportation system. According to documents obtained by WKMG, the day care facility was cited in a July inspection report for not thoroughly keeping track of children transported in company vehicles.  
The report read, "The facility's log for children transported did not include the following required elements: [destination time, arrival time, destination location and departure location.]."
A representative for Little Miracles Academy did not immediately return International Business Times' request for comment.

Walt Disney Company's (WDC) CEO Bob Iger wants to take part in the online streaming service competition as the company announced its plan to pull all Disney films from Netflix to launch its own streaming service Tuesday, according to a press release published on WDC's website. 
Disney's direct-to-consumer streaming service is slated to launch in 2019, with an ESPN streaming service to arrive before it in 2018. It will include films from Disney and Pixar past and present, with 2019 titles like "Toy Story 4" and "Frozen 2" slated to hit the service. To make the magic possible, Disney will acquire an additional 42 percent stake in BAMTech — the video streaming company founded by Major League Baseball — by way of $1.58 billion.
SEE ALSO: What’s New On Netflix In August 2017? Top 9 Movies, TV Shows
Myles Worthington, a press representative for Netflix, issued a statement Tuesday to International Business Times about how WDC's streaming services plans will affect Netflix. 
"US Netflix members will have access to Disney films on the service through the end of 2019, including all new films that are shown theatrically through the end of 2018," Worthington told IBT. "We [will] continue to do business with the Walt Disney Company globally on many fronts, including our ongoing relationship with Marvel TV."
So how much will Disney gain from this transition? And how much will Netflix lose from Disney's absence?
Forbes reports that Netflix CEO Reed Hastings' net worth is to $2.1 billion, with CNN reporting in May that the company is worth $70 million. However, according to CNBC, Netflix's stock reportedly dropped by 5 percent after the WDC confirmed the news. Yahoo! Finance shows that the streaming service's stock price is at $178.36, which dropped to $174.20 at close 5:12 p.m. EDT. Disney's stock increased to $106.98, but Yahoo! Finance shows that company's stock dropped by 4 percent at 5:16 PM EDT. 
By doing a thorough count of Disney films on Netflix, the streaming service will have to give up over 100 titles. Netflix acquired Disney's content in 2012, however, it didn't arrive online until 2016. Forbes reported in 2012 that the deal cost $300 million, but it ensured that Netflix was the sole streaming service to distribute Disney's new film content online. 
Disney's departure would likely be a setback for Netflix at first with a decrease in subscribers. The Fiscal Times reported in March that this has occurred in the past when the streaming service has cut content. However, Netflix will likely make up for this setback as it continues to be a leader in producing successful original content like "Stranger Things" and "Orange Is The New Black." According to Business Insider, Netflix told shareholders in April, "We have a large market opportunity ahead of us and we’re optimizing long-term FCF by growing our original content aggressively."

After a widely reported accusation by a Brooklyn bar and venue that Kendall Jenner failed to tip on a recent $24 tab, the 21-year-old model and reality star responded Monday evening. Jenner asserted — contrary the claim posted on Instagram by Baby’s All Right last week — that she did indeed leave a tip in the form of cash.

The star was publicly shamed last week after Baby’s All Right posted a photo of Jenner’s bar tap to Instagram. The tab showed no tip added to the signed copy and was captioned, “Don't forget to tip your bartender :)” As of Tuesday afternoon, the post appeared to have been deleted from the bar’s Instagram account.

Kendall slammed the allegation on Twitter Monday evening by claiming that she’d left a cash tip rather than no tip at all, as was insinuated by the bar.
“damn, i guess next time we won't tip in cash,” she wrote in a response that was “liked” 40,000 times and retweeted thousands more by Tuesday afternoon. The tweet quoted a fan who had tagged her in a response to the aforementioned allegation.

“I love @KendallJenner I’m sure there’s more to this story,” the fan’s tweet read. “Everyone’s so quick to judge cause she’s part of the Kardashian’s [  sic ].”
The controversy with Baby’s All Right isn’t the first time the eldest Jenner sister has come under fire by restaurant staff. The reality star-turned-fashion mogul muse faced similar backlash in 2014 after she and fellow model Hailey Baldwin allegedly threw money at former “Skins” star and waitress Blaine Morris while she served Jenner and Baldwin at a restaurant in New York.

“That horrible moment you chase a Kardashian down the street because she forgot to pay her bill to be thrown money in your face,” Morris tweeted in August of 2014. Jenner later sent a cease and desist demanding an “appropriate retraction and sincere apology,” and Morris ultimately deleted the tweet,  E! News reported at the time.

As of Monday afternoon, Jenner appeared ready to move on from the controversy, tweeting a link to a hair tutorial on her website. Just a couple of hours later, she posted a captionless selfie to Twitter.
Baby’s All Right did not immediately return International Business Times’ request for comment.

Cardinal Health shareholders wanted to be sure that the company’s medicines were not used for lethal injections. But the Securities and Exchange Commission Friday approved the health services company’s request to block the shareholder proposal from coming to a vote.
Cardinal Health, which distributes pharmaceuticals, medical supplies and equipment across the country, earned a profit of $1.29 billion last year. The company objected to the shareholder proposal, which identified eight drugs sold by Cardinal that are used for executions. An investigation by the Associated Press found that at least three doses of one of those drugs, rocuronium bromide, were purchased by the Virginia Department of Corrections. In Virginia’s lethal injections, rocuronium bromide is used to stop breathing after a sedative is administered.
Cardinal Health declined to comment for this article.
The shareholder resolution was brought by the New York State Common Retirement Fund, the state’s public pension plan. The pension fund is the third largest in the country, valued at roughly $192 billion. Its proposal was for Cardinal to produce a report detailing the controls it has in place to ensure that its drugs are not sold to prisons, as they were in Virginia.
Filings show Cardinal argued to the SEC that the proposal deals with the company’s “ordinary business operations,” such as relationships with suppliers and sales to customers, and can therefore be excluded from a shareholder vote. The SEC has been increasingly permissive of corporation’s requests to not let shareholder resolutions move forward — with 78 percent approved this year, compared to 68 percent in 2016. Meanwhile, Texas Rep. Jeb Hensariling, Chair of the House Financial Services committee, has introduced legislation that would drastically reduce the number of shareholders able to file proposals.

The impetus for New York’s proposal was not a moral concern about the death penalty but an extension of the pension fund’s fiscal responsibility. The fund, a long-term investor focused on stable profits, is concerned about the potential damage to a company’s reputation — and therefore value — if it becomes known as a supplier of drugs for lethal injection.
“Many pharmaceutical manufacturers oppose the use of their medicines in executions and impose contractual restrictions on their distributors to prevent their use in lethal injections,” Matthew Sweeney, spokesperson for the New York State comptroller’s office, told International Business Times. “If Cardinal were to provide a restricted drug for use in an execution, and breach a contract with the manufacturer, it would put itself, and its investors at risk of financial and reputational damage.”
All FDA-approved manufacturers of these pharmaceuticals in the U.S. publicly oppose the use of their drugs in lethal injections. Pfizer is the primary producer of rocuronium bromide in the country and its contracts with distributors, such as Cardinal, require those companies to be sure that their drugs do not wind up being used in executions. Pfizer’s public policy paper on the issue reads, in part:
“Pfizer makes its products to enhance and save the lives of the patients we serve. Consistent with these values, Pfizer strongly objects to the use of its products as lethal injections for capital punishment.”
However, Pfizer did not have that policy until May of last year. The drug manufacturer’s decision was, in part, attributed to pressure from the New York pension fund, which filed a similar shareholder proposal in late 2015. Even though the SEC allowed the proposal to be exempted and it was never brought to a vote, the public pressure and threat of shareholder action was enough to persuade Pfizer that the potential damage to its reputation was not worth the risk. Cardinal may yet come to the same conclusion.


United Airlines found itself in hot water once again after a Houston family blamed the airline for the death of their 5-year-old dog, who was put in the cargo hold of a plane that was delayed at the airport in Houston, according to ABC13.
The Rasmussen family claimed the dog, a King Charles Spaniel, was in the cargo hold while the plane stayed on the tarmac for two hours before it took off to San Francisco, the ABC affiliate report also said. 
The family said the dog died while it was held in the hold.

"We are so sorry to learn of Lulu's passing and have reached out to our customer to offer our condolences and assistance. We are deeply upset any time an animal suffers an injury while traveling with us and especially grieved in the rare instance that one passes away. We are conducting a thorough review of this incident," the airline said in a statement to International Business Times. The statement didn't reveal the cause of the dog's death.
United Airlines had the worst record in pet deaths among airlines in the U.S. in 2016.  According to the Department of Transportation’s Air Travel Consumer Report, nine pets — eight dogs and a Sphynx kitten — died under the airline's care in 2016.
"More than 300 animals have died in cargo holds since 2005, including 74 on United flights. According to a report from the U.S. Department of Transportation, the airline had the worst record of animal deaths and injuries among all U.S. airlines in 2016," a PETA blog post also noted.
Over the last few months, United Airlines has found itself in a slew of controversies, with some linked to animals.
In April, a 10-month-old Continental Giant rabbit named Simon died on a United flight from the United Kingdom to the U.S. The animal was the offspring of the Guinness World Record-holding rabbit, Darius. Simon was found dead after arriving at the O’Hare airport, and the airline was blamed for its death as the rabbit was said to be in a healthy condition prior to boarding the plane. 
PETA’s president, Ingrid Newkirk, issued a statement following Simon’s death.
“This rabbit was failed first by the breeder – who churns out and sells baby bunnies when animal shelters and rescue groups are full of homeless rabbits – and then by United Airlines, which shipped him off in a cargo hold like an old suitcase,” Newkirk said.

“This rabbit’s death is not unique – more than 300 animals have died in cargo holds since 2005, and many more have been injured or lost,” Newkirk continued in her statement. “PETA urges United to join JetBlue and Southwest in prohibiting companion animals from being flown as checked baggage in the confusion, noise, extreme temperatures, and improper pressurization of a cargo hold.”
Last month, rapper ScHoolboy Q accused United of putting his dog in a wrong flight. The rapper, whose real name is Quincy Matthew Hanley, asked the airline for an explanation on Twitter, adding he was "pissed" due to the incident and planned to sue the airline.


While both political parties have denounced the  rising cost of prescription drugs, neither  Democrats nor Republicans have done much to address the problem. But this summer, a new tool to restrict the rising prices of drugs developed with taxpayer dollars has been introduced by the two U.S. senators who don’t belong to either party.
The mechanism works like this: Drug manufacturers who take federal money to develop drugs must keep their U.S. prices in line with the prices they charge in other economically advanced nations — typically much lower than drug prices in the U.S.

The system would prevent pharmaceutical companies from effectively double-charging U.S. consumers by using their tax money for research and then charging them some of the steepest prices in the world at the pharmacy. Pharmaceutical companies, who pour millions of dollars into both the  Democratic and Republican parties, are against the idea, which is perhaps why the fix is being pushed by Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Angus King of Maine, the only independents in congress.
The U.S. has the highest level of  per capita pharmaceutical spending of any nation on Earth, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). And while Americans spend more than any other country to buy their drugs, they also spend more than any other country to  develop those same drugs.
Senator Angus King (I-ME) asks questions at a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing on the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) in Washington, D.C., June 7, 2017. King introduced an amendment into a military spending bill that would require drug makers keep drug prices in line with pharmaceutical costs in other countries.  Photo: Reuters
In June, King successfully added language to the  2018 military spending bill (still working its way through congress) that would allow the Department of Defense to take away exclusive patents from drug companies that benefitted from DoD funding if their drug price in the U.S. rises above the median price in seven foreign countries with similar economies.
Then last week, Sanders introduced  legislation that would tie the prices of drugs made with government funding to costs in other countries. Unlike King’s language, Sanders’ bill would expand the concept beyond the DoD. The bill requires companies taking federal funds to develop drugs to enter into “reasonable pricing” agreements with the Secretary of Health and Human Services.
“Under this insane system, Americans pay twice. First we pay to create these lifesaving drugs, then we pay high prices to buy those drugs,” wrote Sanders in  a New York Times op-ed. “Our government must stop being pushovers for the pharmaceutical industry and  its 1,400 lobbyists.”
The bill defines a “reasonable price” as no more than the lowest prices charged in countries with GDP and per capita income similar to the U.S. (The bill specifically pegs pricing to countries in the Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development.)
The proposal is the  latest salvo in Sanders’ effort to stop the military from granting French pharmaceutical company Sanofi Pasteur the exclusive right to sell a Zika vaccine.
“The days of allowing Sanofi and other drug makers to gouge American consumers after taking billions in taxpayer money must end,” Sanders told  HuffPost this week. “That is why I am introducing legislation to demand fairer, lower prices for the Zika vaccine and for every drug developed with government resources.”
But just how much government support the industry receives is up for debate. While industry estimates put total annual private R&D spending by biopharmaceutical companies at about  $60 billion per year, the government’s contribution is much harder to nail down. The National Institutes of Health, the government’s main funder of health research, told International Business Times in a statement that “there is no exact number which would accurately capture NIH investment” in drug development. In total, NIH spends about  $32 billion on medical research annually.
Last year, the National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics estimated that in 2014, total federal government R&D spending on pharmaceuticals and medicines  was just $267 million. But that number takes into account only money given directly to drug makers.
“Federal support of biopharma R&D isn’t going to take the form of big checks cut to companies,”  Scott Hinds, a pharmaceutical industry analyst for investment research firm Sector and Sovereign Research told IBT in an email. “Rather, it’s going to come through funding grants and research for academics, government employees and other non-industry scientists.”
“Typically, then, if anything of commercial value is discovered in this sponsored research, those compounds will be sold or licensed to drug companies who have the capital and resources to spend on later phase (more expensive) clinical development necessary to bring them to market,” Hinds said.
Other experts told IBT federal support of drug development goes well beyond just funding research.
“It’s not so much the money we are actually spending through NIH. We are providing huge value to companies in tax credits, other incentives, expedited FDA approval, exclusivity agreements… all of these are benefits,” Rachel Sachs, an associate professor at the Washington University in St. Louis School of Law told IBT.
Sachs cited a 50 percent tax credit for the development of  “orphan” drugs as an example of the government’s support of the pharmaceutical industry. The value of that orphan drug tax credit is estimated to be worth $50 billion between 2016 and 2025, according to the  Treasury Department.

But the benefits flow both ways between the pharmaceutical industry and Washington, which is why the Sanders bill faces an uphill battle to reach the floor for a vote. The bill was sent to the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions committee, which is chaired by Lamar Alexander. Pharmaceutical and health products companies gave more to Alexander’s campaigns between 2011 and 2016 than did any other industry, according to the  Center for Responsive Politics. And even if the bill gets to the floor, it would face opposition from the industry’s  1,350 lobbyists, who don’t come cheap. The pharmaceutical and health products industry has spent a remarkable  $144 million on lobbying so far in 2017, more than double what the  defense industry has spent over the same time period.
“Proposals to insert a reasonable pricing clause ignore the substantial R&D investments and risks undertaken by the private sector in developing and bringing a new medicine to patients,” the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), which has spent $14 million on lobbying so far this year, told IBT in a statement. “Such proposals undermine critical intellectual property rights and incentives, create substantial uncertainty for companies and establish completely arbitrary criteria for taking intellectual property. This could chill critically needed collaborations and investment by the private sector to address some of our most serious unmet medical needs.”
The pharmaceutical industry, which  says it costs $2.6 billion to bring a drug to market (while  spending more on marketing than research) made a similar argument against “reasonable pricing” more than two decades ago, when it successfully persuaded the Clinton administration to repeal a “reasonable pricing” rule implemented by President George H.W. Bush.

After the  1980 Bayh-Dole Act, private researchers could patent intellectual property they developed using federal funding. But by the late 1980s, outrage over the $8,000 annual cost of  AIDS drug AZT, which was the only drug approved for treatment of the disease at the time, prompted the Bush administration to implement price control measures. In 1989, NIH was granted the right to review the introductory prices of drugs that were produced with government research, over the objections of the pharmaceutical industry.
“The Bush administration felt it was appropriate to expect some concessions on pricing if the government was involved in the drug and funding research,” James Love, director of Knowledge Ecology International, told IBT. Love researched the original rule while working for Ralph Nader’s Center for the Study of Responsive Law in the early 1990s.
But unlike the specific criteria for reasonable pricing put forth in the Sanders bill, the Bush rule was a bit ambiguous. “The agreements said something to the effect that it had to show some relationship between price and government’s role in developing the drug... Nobody really knew what it meant,” Love said.
Just six years later, the  Clinton administration rescinded the order on the grounds that it was harmful to innovation.
“The pricing clause has driven industry away from potentially beneficial scientific collaborations... without providing an offsetting benefit to the public,” NIH Director Dr. Harold Varmus said at the time. “Eliminating the clause will promote research that can enhance the health of the American people.”


A Chinese restaurant sparked controversy for reportedly offering discounts to women based on their bra size. A woman with an A-cup received 5 percent off, while a customer whose chest was closer G-cup could see a 65 percent discount on her meal.
Locals complained to city officials regarding posters suggesting discounts based on bra sizes in the Trendy Shrimp restaurant in a Hangzhou city mall, located in Zhejiang. One customer said the posters were "vulgar advertising" and "discriminatory towards women."

The posters featured outside the restaurant showed cartoon figures of women in their underwear with the caption, "The whole city is looking for BREASTS." It listed discounts based on women’s cup size and claimed the bigger the size, the larger the discount, according to Qianjiang Evening Post Monday.
A poster is pictured above Aug, 7.2017 of women's cup sizes. A woman with an A-cup bra could get 5 percent off her meal, someone with a G-cup could received a 5 percent discount. Photo: QIANJIANG EVENING POST  According to patrons, the restaurant installed the poster August 1 but removed it shortly thereafter as a result of complaints. Trendy Shrimp general manager Lan Shenggang justified the offers by claiming that the promotion increased clientele.
"Once the promotion started, customer numbers rose by about 20 percent," he told Qianjiang Evening Post. He added that the signs flattered some of the customers and said that "some of the girls we met were very proud, they had nothing to hide."
Shenggang said customers could "avoid embarrassment" by inquiring about the discount from a waitress, rather than asking the male staff.

This wasn’t the first time Chinese customers received rewards at an establishment based on their physical appearance. A Korean food market in China reportedly offered free meals to customers deemed attractive in 2015, according to China Daily.
Customers thought to be the "best-looking" received free meals from the market based on opinions from nearby cosmetic surgery clinic staff. Market workers took pictures of customers for the cosmetic workers, who rated them based on aesthetic.
A month later, another Chinese restaurant reportedly offered discounts based on customers' weight. The Na Huo restaurant in Chongqing offered overweight men deals and discounts on food, while women received discounts for being thin, according to the China Radio International. The restaurant offered free meals to men who weighed an upwards of 308 pounds. Women who weighed around 76 pounds received a free meal.
Promotional photos posted to the restaurant’s social media page showed staff weighing customers. 
"Na Huo restaurant cares about fat people and thin people. Bring your fat or thin friends, eat for free," the restaurant’s website stated.
Restaurant discrimination is considered illegal in the United States. Federal law protects any patron from being discriminated against based on appearance, according to the civils rights section of Find Law. Anyone who faces discrimination is urged to file a lawsuit with the U.S. district court.
"Federal law prohibits privately owned facilities that offer food, lodging, gasoline or entertainment to the public from discriminating on the basis of race, color, religion, or national origin," the website read.


Three passengers and seven crew members of American Airlines flight 759 from Greece to Philadephia were injured when the plane was hit by "severe turbulence" just before landing Saturday.
The flight, with 299 people on board, landed at Philadelphia International Airport at 3:10 p.m. EDT., Fox 29 reported. 
The 10 injured had to be hospitalized on landing, the airline said in a statement, which did not provide any details regarding the extent or nature of the injuries.
Passengers said the turbulence lasted for about 15 seconds.
"I was looking forward and I just saw everything just move upwards about four feet," passenger Alex Ehmke said in a phone interview with NBC News. He added: "So, I saw drinks, you know, flying up against walls and up on the ceiling.”
"The gentleman directly behind us and diagonally behind us hit the ceiling himself," Ehmke said.

One of the passengers, Ervin Fang, also tweeted a video of the aftermath of the turbulence.

Another passenger, Jessica Huseman, tweeted photographs of the inside of the flight after the turbulence, showing spilled coffee all over the place.


Huseman also tweeted how the passengers used their fleece blankets to mop the ceiling of the plane after drinks went flying during the disturbance. She also wrote that during the violent shaking, a flight attendant dislocated his shoulder.
Another passenger, Ian Smith of South Philadelphia, shared his experience of the flight with WPVI, an ABC-affiliate.
He said: "Thirty minutes out. They were giving us our drinks. The flight attendants were in the last couple rows when they said 'fasten your seat belts.' And then they said for the flight attendants to get to their seats, and they didn't even have time. It started shaking, then it took a big drop. Babies screaming, people in front of us hitting the ceiling."
In its statement to PennLive, the airline said: "American Airlines flight 759 from Athens, Greece to Philadelphia International Airport briefly encountered severe turbulence shortly before landing safely in Philadelphia. The seatbelt sign was on at the time. Three passengers and seven crew members were transported to a local hospital for evaluation. We are taking care of our passengers and our crew members at this time and want to thank our team members for keeping our passengers safe."

Ten days after announcing that the Falcon Heavy rocket will make its maiden flight in November, SpaceX CEO Elon Musk again took to his Twitter and Instagram accounts Sunday to share the “first draft animation” of what the debut of the rocket — currently the world’s most powerful — could look like.


Keeping in line with what SpaceX has been doing with the Falcon 9 rockets, the animation shows both the side boosters (each of them a Falcon 9) of the rocket landing back on Earth after sending the core on its way. After the first and second stages separate, the first stage rocket (also a Falcon 9) aligns itself for reentry and while the animation shows it landing on ground, Musk had earlier said the center booster will actually land on a drone-ship.

Read: Elon Musk Announces November Test For Falcon Heavy
Musk warned once again that the November debut of the Falcon Heavy (an exact date hasn’t yet been fixed) could be a failure when he said in the Instagram post there was a “lot that can go wrong in the November launch…”
Earlier, when he announced the first flight of the rocket and was replying to some of his many Twitter followers, Musk had mentioned luck as a factor.

While speaking at the International Space Station Research and Development Conference in Washington, D.C., on July 19, Musk said even just getting away with no damage to the launch pad would be considered something of a success.
“There’s a lot of risk associated with Falcon Heavy, a real good chance that that vehicle does not make it to orbit. I want to make sure to set expectations accordingly. I hope it makes it far enough beyond the pad so that it does not cause pad damage. I would consider even that a win, to be honest,” Musk reportedly said of the November test.
Despite the repeated success of Falcon 9 (barring the one on-ground explosion in September 2016), Musk has repeatedly stressed that putting the Falcon Heavy in orbit will not be easy. That three of the familiar rocket’s cores were being put together to power the Falcon Heavy didn’t make things simpler, Musk explained told the International Space Station Research and Development Conference.
“At first it sounds real easy, you just stick two first stages on as strap-on boosters, but then everything changes. All the loads change, aerodynamics totally change. You’ve tripled the vibration and acoustics. You sort of break the qualification levels on so much of the hardware. … The amount of load you’re putting through that center core is crazy because you’ve got two super-powerful boosters also shoving that center core, so we had to redesign the whole center core airframe. It’s not like the Falcon 9 because it’s got to take so much load. Then you’ve got separation systems,” Musk said.

There are two Falcon Heavy tests scheduled for the first half of 2018, and their fate will depend on how the November test goes. All tests will take place from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida. SpaceX can’t use its own Texas testing facility because it can’t support the thrust (5.1 million pounds at take-off) generated by the Falcon Heavy.
If there are no unexpected explosions and damaged launch pads, commercial flights of Falcon Heavy will start in the latter half of 2018. The pricing details on the SpaceX website say customers would have to pay $90 million to send up to 8 metric tons of payload to geosynchronous transfer orbit. The largest rocket in operation currently — the United Launch Alliance’s (a Boeing-Lockheed Martin joint venture) Delta Heavy IV — has almost half the payload capacity of the Falcon Heavy. So putting the rocket into commercial operation could mean a big business boost for SpaceX, which — with an estimated valuation of $21 billion — is already among the world’s most valuable privately held companies.


A t-shirt company is looking to reclaim the swastika symbol for "love and peace" and to shake the stigma of the Nazi Party's 20th Century appropriation.
For centuries, the swastika was a positive Hindu, Buddhist cultural symbol and ancient religious icon used in the Indian subcontinent . It would later be twisted and appropriated by the Nazi party to symbolize Nazi Germany in the 1920s-1945. While the ancient symbol once meant good luck, it is now inextricably linked to the oppressive regime of the Nazis who attempted to create an Aryan race and perpetrated the Holocaust on European Jews. One t-shirt company, however, appears to think they can get the symbol back.
The company, KA design, is selling t-shirts and sweatshirts online through Teespring, an online custom clothing retailer, depicting a white swastika on a rainbow background with the word peace below. Another design spells out the word love in white on a rainbow background with the ‘o’ replaced by a swastika.
READ: Andrew Anglin Neo-Nazi Website Founder Missing After Jewish Woman Filed Lawsuit Over Internet Trolls
The company’s tag line is “questing boundaries” and on their Facebook posted a video explaining their idea.
“They took the swastika, rotated it 45 degrees and turned it into hatred, fear, racism and power.
They stigmatized the swastika. They won. They limited our freedom. Or Maybe Not?” the video reads. “The swastika is coming back together with love, peace, respect and freedom.”
The symbol is still banned in Germany after it was used during World War II by Adolf Hitler and the Nazis. In the United States, the swastika is considered a hate symbol.
“We really like the symbol in its shape and aesthetics, and we would love to share the beauty of this symbol detached from the hatred associated with it,” said a representative from the company to Dazed Magazine Saturday. “We hope to be able to extend our Swastika line to new design concept and colors, while keeping our current peace message. Our dream is to feel free to use this symbol without any kind of limitation, however we prefer.”
The Facebook page of the company is filled with people who are not fans of what the company is trying to do.
“I don't know why it seemed necessary to try and "reinvent" a symbol that caused so much pain and is still so painful for so many,” said one commenter on Facebook. “Please do not buy this disturbing product. You can not erase the evil this symbol embodies and is a reminder of, no matter what colour you decide to make it.”
Another commenter felt that the symbol is gone forever.

“This is inconsiderate. It doesn't matter what this symbol used to be, it has changed for ever, it can never be seen the same way. More than 60 million people died because of Nazism and you think that can be forgotten? Shame on your company!” she wrote.
The company has a 1.5 star rating on Facebook.

An increasing amount of cable companies seemed to give into the streaming boom as some companies reportedly decided to partner with streaming behemoth Netflix. More U.S. cable companies are expected to make Netflix accessible through its set-top boxes.
No. 3 cable provider Charter Communications Inc is supposed to partner up with Netflix, according to Reuters Sunday. More than a dozen top U.S. cable companies joined up with Netflix and some could start selling the streaming service in tandem with video and internet offers.
TRENDING: Karate Kid TV Show: Who Will Star In The YouTube Show?
Cable provider Altice NV ATCA.AS attempted a similar deal in France and is looking to duplicate it in the U.S., sources told Reuters this month.
"Our whole model is about cooperation with many of the (streaming) providers," Altice USA ATUS.N Chief Executive Dexter Goei told reporters in May.
Netflix said it considered making similar types of deals with other pay TV providers.
"We're now looking at proposals for including Netflix in some services and beginning to learn the bundling part of the business," Netflix CEO Reed Hastings said during a webcast in July. "We're interested in expanding that."
These partnerships could help expand Netflix’s customers in the United States, market analysts considered saturated, while expansion overseas has exploded. 
As of June 30, Netflix reported 51.92 million U.S.-based streaming customers and 52.03 million foreign-based streaming customers, which surpassed analyst’s predictions.
According to a report released July, Parks Associates found that 59 percent of U.S. broadband households subscribe to Netflix, Amazon, or Hulu.
Netflix’s deals with pay TV companies helped it surpass expectations in the U.S. market, Cowen & Co analyst John Blackledge told Reuters.
"U.S. consumers are not taking solely a Netflix, Amazon, or Hulu subscription. Many are shopping around and trialing new services to get access to interesting content unavailable through the big services," said Brett Sappington, Senior Director of Research, Parks Associates in a July statement.
He added, "Interest and viewership in OTT video services have led to an increase in total subscriptions since 2015, including an increase in households subscribing to two, three, or even four or more services. All this translates into more money being spent by consumers and more opportunity for niche content services to capture revenues."
The deals cable companies made are a turnaround compared to years of resistance to streaming.  Pay Tv providers viewed Netflix as a huge competitor since its inception in 2007. Some cable executes deemed the partnerships to combat cord-cutting, a voiding of cable subscriptions, while endorsing high-speed internet offers.
Pay tv, streaming service combinations started in 2013, with British company Virgin Media. U.S. partnerships launched in 2014, with small businesses like RCN Telecom Services.
For RCN patrons with TiVo TIVO.O boxes, Netflix was made available as an on-screen option in the menu. RCN customers not subscribed to Netflix could sign up for a free, one-month trial seamlessly through the on-screen menu.
U.S. cable leader Comcast Corp inserted Netflix into its Xfinity X1 box set last year. 30 percent of Xfinity customers logged into Netflix via an existing account or by signing up, the company told Reuters in May.

The beleaguered ride-hailing app Uber is searching for a new CEO after a string of controversies including a purported atmosphere of sexual harassment at the company.
Former CEO, Travis Kalanick, a controversial figure himself, stepped down, hoping a new leader would help steady the company’s leadership. While the company’s search included several high-profile female executives, it appears as if the company could not convince a woman to sign on, and their short list has been narrowed to three men according to a report by the Washington Post Friday.
Last month the company underwent a work place review by law firm Covington and Burling, who produced a 13-page report detailing how the company can improve. The company’s board unanimously accepted the recommendations of the report which included a stricter sexual harassment policy.

“Uber should consider adopting a zero-tolerance policy for substantiated complaints of discrimination and harassment, without regard to whether an employee is a 'high performer' or a long-term employee,” read the report.
The toxic environment for women was spotlighted when a former employee wrote a blog post detailing how she was treated at Uber, prompting others to come forward.
Uber’s board was hoping to bring in a CEO that would help smooth over public relations for the company. Bringing in a woman would show that the company was earnestly trying to change its culture. Several high-profile women, however, apparently weren’t interested. Names associated with the search who have declined the role included Facebook’s chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg and Susan Wojcicki who heads YouTube, according to the Post. Sandberg was pushed as a choice by Uber’s board, especially Arianna Huffington. In her less than two years on the board, Huffington, former media mogul, has become an outspoken and influential member of the company’s leadership. Huffington was also rumored to be in consideration for the role.
Hewlett Packard CEO Meg Whitman publicly bowed out the search in a post on Twitter.
The three men on the short list to become head of Uber include Jeffrey Immelt who is leaving as the CEO of General Electric, according to the Financial Times.

The role is seen as not particularly desirable given the circumstances of it being a cleanup job, and the strong-headed Kalanick, 41, still remains a member of the board of the company he co-founded. According to the Times, Kalanick is involved in the search to find his replacement.
Uber has a number of leadership roles vacant that could see female hires. Last month Bozoma Saint John, a former Apple leader, joined Uber as a chief brand officer. More hires like Saint John could address the company’s concern that 78 percent of its leadership roles are held by men. That number comes from a diversity report the company released earlier this year.

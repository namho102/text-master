On 20 March, Denver Broncos general manager John Elway wrote a letter on team stationery endorsing Neil Gorsuch, Donald Trump’s Supreme Court nominee, for a seat on the highest court in the United States.  “Neil is a big Denver Broncos fan, and I can tell you that I am a big fan of his,” the Hall of Fame quarterback wrote. That letter was released exactly two months to the the day that Elway attended Trump’s inauguration in Washington DC.  But eight months after the inauguration and five months after endorsing Gorsuch, Elway released a statement that read: “Hopefully as we go forward we can start concentrating on football a little bit more. Take the politics out of football.” An interesting plea coming from a man who only recently had weighed in on politics below his football team’s logo. But even more peculiar given that how bad the Broncos are, Elway would be wise to want people to talk about anything but the football team he has built. 
Elway’s Broncos, two years after winning the Super Bowl in dominant fashion over the Carolina Panthers, sit dead-last in a middling AFC West at 3-9, three games behind the Chiefs, Chargers and Raiders who are all bunched at 6-6. Denver have now lost eight games in a row; only the Cleveland Browns have a longer losing streak. 
After the Broncos named Elway executive vice president of football operations/GM in January 2011, the organization’s fortunes embarked on a steady incline to a Super Bowl title in February 2016. But Denver have been on an even steeper decline ever since. Don’t believe it? This year’s Broncos offense is 27th in the NFL in points. The 2011 Bronco offense from Elway’s first season on the job? The one that was run by current minor league baseball outfielder Tim Tebow? That unit was 25th in the league in points.
Elway’s earliest moves on the job, jettisoning Tebow to Jets damnation included, all worked. After inheriting a 4-12 Broncos team run by an overmatched Josh McDaniels, Elway turned over Denver’s talented roster to veteran coach John Fox. He then used the No2 overall pick on linebacker Von Miller and, after Tebow helped the Broncos to a division title at 8-8 and into the playoffs (and shockingly won a home playoff game over the Steelers), Elway bid the folk hero QB farewell and went out and signed Peyton Manning, who had missed the 2010 season with a neck injury. While Elway undoubtedly deserves credit for selling Manning on the Broncos over all the other teams that wanted the quarterback’s services, wanting one of the greatest players of all-time on your roster is not exactly the mark of genius. If it was, everyone who calls their local sports radio show to say their team should trade for Tom Brady would be deserving of a high-paying GM job.
The four years of Manning were very good to the Broncos and Elway. The team went 50-14 and extended the run of AFC West division titles to five in a row. After a humiliating 43-8 loss to the Seattle Seahawks in Super Bowl XLVIII, the Broncos won it all two years later with a diminished Manning, but a dominant defense, 24-10 over Carolina. Yet when Manning chose to retire after the season after winning it all at age 39 – the same decision Elway had made in 1998 at age 38 – Elway the GM somehow had little plan for a successor in place.
Elway had spent a second-round pick on Brock Osweiler in the 2012 draft, the last QB taken before Russell Wilson went off the board, and Osweiler started seven games during the 2015 season while Manning battled injuries and poor play. After Manning retired, Elway felt Osweiler was the future and offered him a reported $15m a year to stay on. But Osweiler instead took four years and $72m from the Texans, leaving the reigning Super Bowl champions in the hands of one Trevor Siemian.
Good teams have limited championship windows. Elway knows that himself from his playing career. After reaching the Super Bowl three times between 1986 and 1989, Denver didn’t get back again, and didn’t win, until 1997 when Elway was winding down his career. Yet by handing his championship team over to Trevor Siemian, a seventh-round draft pick who completed just 58.9% of his passes and threw 27 touchdowns to 24 interceptions at the collegiate level, Elway slammed his team’s championship window and locked it tight.
Despite having one of the league’s best receiver duos in Demaryius Thomas and Emmanuel Sanders, the Denver pass offense fell to 21st in the league with Siemian at the controls and the Broncos failed to even get back to the playoffs at 9-7. So with Miller, Thomas, Sanders and others still in their prime, Elway went out this offseason and made a point of upgrading the weakest position on his roster? Nope. He doubled down on the quarterback he had, Siemian and Paxton Lynch, his 2016 first-round pick. While 2016 first-rounders Jared Goff and Carson Wentz are already running high-powered offenses – and mid-round picks Dak Prescott and Jacoby Brissett are also starters – the Broncos have shown little confidence in even putting Lynch in the lineup. He has appeared in four games over two seasons and has yet to even hit the minimum criteria of “shows some promise.” So far he’s looked like little more than a tall version of Siemian.
Elway’s other picks since hitting on Miller in his first draft haven’t been much better than the Lynch selection, especially on the offensive side of the ball. Running back Montee Ball, receivers Cody Latimer and Carlos Henderson and tight end Jeff Heuerman have all made little to no impact. Unless Lynch suddenly develops or Elway manages to land another future Hall of Famer in free agency, the future doesn’t look bright for the Broncos. Even sunlight isn’t passing through that championship window now.
Only the angriest Broncos fans are already calling for Elway’s weathered head. This disaster of a season apart, his tenure has resulted in five division titles in season years, two Super Bowl appearances and one Super Bowl title. And as a franchise legend, he’ll get more time than your average floundering GM. But if things keep trending the way they over the next season or two, a future release on Broncos letterhead won’t be about supreme court appointees. It will be announcing that John Elway has been relieved of his duties.


In both Brisbane and Adelaide England have managed to tantalise. They have not been uniformly hopeless. They clung on at the Gabba for three days; indeed there were moments there when they could have taken control of that game. Conversely in Adelaide, having played ineptly for two and a half days, they bowled Australia out for 138 in their second innings and so conjured up the possibility of an historic victory. On the fourth day they rose again and allowed their fans to dream. On the fifth grim reality returned. All out for 233 defeated by 120 runs.
Nonetheless there have been moments when the soft underbelly of their opponents has been visible. This is not a vintage Australian side. Darren Lehmann is not a backward looking bloke, which is just as well. If he was he would surely look at some of his batsmen and then wonder how it was that he only played 27 Tests for Australia and Stuart Law played just one. How Steve Smith would love a Lehmann and a Law in his middle order; so would Joe Root for that matter.
But the capacity to tantalise butters no parsnips. Look at the score; England head to Perth 2-0 down despite their little renaissance towards the end of the match in Adelaide. Australia may have recovered from 2-0 down under Don Bradman in the summer of 1936-7, but there are no more recent precedents to cheer Joe Root and his fellow travellers. The analysts will have to be at their most inventive to bring some good cheer to their table.
At the start of the second Test there was a hint of desperation in the England camp peculiarly allied with a timidity among their bowlers. There have been worse insertions by an England captain in Ashes history: 2002 and 1982 immediately spring to mind and the history books - and John Woodcock, one of the few witnesses left - acknowledge that putting Australia in at Brisbane in 1954 did not work out so well. But the simple fact that Root opted to verge from the orthodox tells of his uncertainty that his bowlers would be able to take 20 wickets cheaply enough. After the second innings in Brisbane he lacked confidence in them. So he gambled. He was not convinced that orthodoxy would work.
Moreover his bowlers, however experienced, seemed to feel the pressure on that first morning. They did not bowl dreadfully in the opening overs of the match but they did bowl cagily; there were wary of bowling too full and there was not much zip – in stark contrast to their efforts in the second innings, albeit in the devious dark. A captain who is conscious of the limitations of his attack is more prone to try to pluck rabbits out of his hat; it is a ploy that seldom works.
England’s pace bowlers may be as skillful as their counterparts but they are slower. The misgivings about England’s attack are most easily identified when contrasting Nathan Lyon and Moeen Ali. Admittedly Moeen has been handicapped by injuries to his side and his spinning finger but there has been a gulf between this pair. Lyon is fizzing the ball down and, critically, it is dipping at the end of its flight path. He is tormenting England’s left-handers, including the veteran Alastair Cook, who had few problems with pacemen here but looked like a novice against the finger spinner.
Ten of Lyon’s 11 victims in the series bat left-handed (the next generation surely requires ambidextrous batsmen to combat quality off-spinners or left-armers). It may be that we all underestimated him before the series and therefore did not consider the best way to attack him. There was not much talk before the Ashes tour party was announced about the need for right-handed batsmen. Now we bemoan the fact that the one spare batsman, Gary Ballance, is also left-handed. Lyon has bowled extremely well and quickly; he has also made the ball turn, all of which makes it very difficult for left-handers to attack him. This explains why the push to promote Jonny Bairstow above Moeen has nothing to do with psychology and everything to do with strategy.
Of the left-handers Moeen may be more inclined to attack Lyon than the others but he has also been dismissed by him four times out of four. Yet the blunt and difficult truth is that England will have to attack him successfully to get back in the series and they need their right-handers at the crease for much longer if that’s going to happen. It should be more difficult for Lyon to prevail at the Waca where the ball seldom turns – at least it never used to. One suspects in his last Test there John Lewis, the curator, would like to finish with a fast, bouncy pitch that has been the USP of one of cricket’s iconic grounds. However there are doubts whether this is still possible. In recent times the Waca has been more of a haven for batsmen than fast bowlers.
There are, at least, a couple of plusses for England post Adelaide. They discovered that Craig Overton has potential. For the moment he may be a callow Test cricketer, but he clearly has the stomach for the fight. This was evident as much from his batting in the first innings – remember how he had endured three ducks in Australia before taking guard in his first Test match – and his fielding, in particular the way he clung on to a tricky skier down at long leg. He did not bowl too badly either, which made Root’s preference for Moeen on the fourth morning all the more puzzling. Overton has surely leapt above Jake Ball in the pecking order. It was also encouraging to see Chris Woakes bounding up to the crease in the second innings when it all started to click again. And the team is still trying its best, which was not always our impression four years ago. Unfortunately that may not be enough.
Over the next few days there will be much talk of Durham’s Mark Wood, who is earmarked to play in the two-day match in Perth that begins on Saturday against a raw Cricket Australia XI. He has not bowled at 90mph for a long time; he has barely bowled with a red ball in the last six months. Sadly this is likely to be yet another example of desperate straw-clutching, an habitual exercise for Englishmen on the majority of Ashes tours.


Russian officials and public figures have referred to the ban on the Russian team from taking part in the 2018 Winter Olympics as “war”, “racism” and “genocide”, as Tuesday evening’s announcement by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) was met by a wave of righteous anger.
The allegations of doping were hardly mentioned as officials and ordinary Russians attempted to portray the punishments merely as the west acting to keep brave Russia down.
“They are so scared of us,” wrote Irina Rodnina, the former Olympic skating champion who is now a pro-Kremlin MP, on Twitter. Vladimir Zhirinovsky, leader of a pro-Kremlin ultra-nationalist party, called the decision “political and sporting racism”.
Konstantin Kosachev, chair of the foreign affairs committee in the upper house of Russia’s parliament, said the decision was “part of the general western policy of holding Russia back” – a theme that was developed by other officials.
“They are always trying to put us down in everything – our way of life, our culture, our history and now our sport,” wrote Maria Zakharova, spokeswoman for the Russian foreign ministry, in a Facebook post.
Zakharova lumped in the Olympics ban with “world war, the collapse of the Soviet Union and sanctions” as ills the west had supposedly imposed on Russia.
Sergei Alekseyev, the head of the Association of Sports Lawyers, told Parliamentskaya Gazeta newspaper: “Basically, Russians have been discriminated against based on their nationality, which is no more and no less than genocide.”
A decision on whether Russian athletes will boycott the Games rather than compete as neutrals has yet to be made, and Vladimir Putin’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov was one of the few voices urging calm on Wednesday, stating that the IOC decision should be “seriously and deeply analysed” before any decision was taken.
Peskov also said it was too early to decide on the fate of Vitaly Mutko, Russia’s deputy prime minister, who has been banned for life from Olympic tournaments. Mutko is still the head of the Russian Football Union and last week took part in the World Cup draw in Moscow.
Although few people in Russia accept there may be truth to the allegations of a systematic, state-backed doping system made by the whistleblower Grigory Rodchenkov, there is anger at Mutko for his failure to prevent a national ban. A Communist MP, Valery Rashkin, called on Wednesday for Mutko to resign and said he planned to take the minister to court for besmirching Russia’s honour on the international stage.
Opinions are divided on whether Russian athletes should agree to take part as neutral competitors or whether the country should boycott the Games.
“My personal position is that to go as a team under the white flag is unacceptable,” Kosachev wrote. “But it’s also unfair and wrong to forbid our athletes from taking part in a competition they’ve prepared for their whole lives. Each person should decide for themselves.”
Chechnya’s Kremlin-backed leader, Ramzan Kadyrov, said he would not allow any athletes from his region to compete. The state-run television network said it would not broadcast the Games.
The 2014 Olympics in Sochi were presented by the Russian authorities as a sign that modern Russia had become a globally important country. Russia’s sweeping victory in the medals table was met by an outpouring of national pride, however the doping scandal and reassignment of medals means that in the recalculated tables Russia has lost its first place.
The foreign affairs analyst Konstantin von Eggert wrote on Facebook that the IOC’s decision was a “massive act of public humiliation for the Kremlin” and would probably be met with a firm response. “And I’m not talking about a boycott of the 2018 Olympics, which goes without saying, but about Ukraine, about hacking, maybe about Libya. Putin will not forgive this.”
Peskov said he did not know whether Putin would speak on the issue during a speech planned for Wednesday afternoon.


It felt like a classic case of missed opportunity. Olympic golf had been beset by such a wave of negative publicity before the actual event got under way in Rio that the success of the competition itself, plus the weight Justin Rose placed in victory, was much needed. So, too, was the news that golf had finally and formally been retained as an Olympic sport for 2024 in Paris.
Yet it was a case of blink and you’d miss the latter situation. Rather than celebrate a stirring recovery from the point where players questioned the validity of Olympic inclusion – and in several high-profile cases refused to travel to Brazil – the news trickled out.
Ask around in golf circles and many are unaware of golf’s continued Olympic alliance. The public relations campaign has been non-existent rather than bullish. In many ways, this sums up the culture of taking things for granted which undermines the sport.
“Golf, as one of the 28 sports, is excited about the opportunity that this creates for the continued development and growth of our sport around the world,” said the International Golf Federation. “We look forward to building upon the success of golf’s return to the Rio 2016 Olympic Games and working with the organising committee of Paris 2024 to create a memorable experience for our athletes and fans, and a lasting legacy for golf.”
The excitement hardly leaps out of this corporate comment. If part of the IGF’s role is to deliver a powerful Olympic message on behalf of golf, they have fallen short.
It has taken questions from players for golf’s Olympic plans to be expanded upon. Those scheduling the sport have also played a part, with the switching of the US PGA Championship to May from 2019 set to create space and attention around the Olympics when it falls. “It is every four years, it is a big thing to win a medal,” said Henrik Stenson, who was runner-up to Rose in Brazil. “The important thing is it was a good competition when we played it, good on television and good for the sport. That secured us for a number of Olympics.
“It was a great experience for me and I’d love to be there again. The whole presentation from golf’s side turned out really well. I think we will see some increased participation going forward, a few guys who didn’t go seemed to feel like they missed out on something. You realise you are part of something bigger there. I haven’t heard any negatives from players who went.”
The broader and intriguing picture relates to format. In Rio, for both men and women, it was four rounds of stroke play and was criticised for being identical to standard stops on the PGA or LPGA Tours. There was an understanding that tweaks would be made for 2020 in Tokyo, with match play or team elements raised as possibilities. “It would have been fun to play for another medal in a team format,” added Stenson.
“The golf is over a two-week period for women and men to play for three medals each. Even if you are not in the absolute mix for an individual medal, something big is still up for grabs. You could do that but the issue might be some countries having only one qualified player. You could have one great player from a country and nothing else then they are out of the team format.
“I know there was some format talks earlier this year, I was asked to give my thoughts but I don’t know where we stand now.”
Rose, though, sees no reason for alteration. “It has proved to be one of the most important things in my career,” said the Englishman. “I’m not saying it is a major championship but I’m saying it is one of the most important events there is for golf.
“I think this is the truest, most tried and tested format. Look at the WGC Match Play where they have tweaked the format because they know the No1 player can go out in the first round. With 18 holes of match play, you are not always going to get the truest and best player on that week.
“I think if they added a medal and did a combined team competition too, that would be a cool addition but I think 72-hole stroke play is the truest form of the game. For an event that important, that’s what it should be.”


Johanna Konta has appointed Michael Joyce as her new coach. The British No1 has been looking for a replacement for Wim Fissette since their surprise split in October and has turned to the 44-year-old, who used to coach Maria Sharapova.
Joyce will be in Konta’s camp for the first tournament of the new season in Brisbane, starting on 1 January. “Michael is a fantastic coach with a great pedigree and I’m really excited to work with him,” she said. “2017 has been amazing but I feel like there is so much more to come. Our first tournament together will be the Brisbane International and the plan is for Michael to travel with me full-time through 2018.”
Konta ended her partnership with Fissette after a disappointing end to what had been an impressive 2017. She won her biggest singles title of her career in Miami and followed that up with a run to the Wimbledon semi-final, which sent her to No4 in the world. But that proved the high point of her campaign and a poor run of form in the autumn saw her part ways with Fissette in October.
After a lengthy recruitment process she has now appointed Joyce, who worked with Sharapova for seven years between 2004 and 2011 and helped the Russian to two grand slam titles and the world No1 ranking. The American, whose highest rank as a player was 64 in 1996, has most recently worked with another former world No1 Victoria Azarenka.
Konta has retained Gill Myburgh as her fitness coach, Milly Mirkovic as her physio and Elena Sosa as her mental coach.


Former British bobsledder John Jackson has expressed his support for the International Olympic Committee’s decision to effectively ban Russia from the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics.
Jackson and the rest of his GB four-man crew are in line to receive a retrospective bronze medal from Sochi 2014 after two Russian crews that finished ahead of them were disqualified for doping by the International Olympic Committee last week.
The IOC announced on Monday that there will be no Russian flags or anthems in Pyeongchang, and only Russians who can prove they have not cheated – verified by credible anti-doping agencies – will be invited to take part.
Jackson told Press Association Sport: “I always said the IOC should ban Russia as a nation and their flag should not be seen in Pyeongchang, but any athlete who can prove they are clean should be allowed to compete.
“It is going to be quite difficult to prove or disprove their eligibility but as an athlete, all you can ask is that you are allowed to compete on a level playing field to everyone else.”
The issue of Russian eligibility is particularly pertinent within the International Bobsleigh and Skeleton Federation, who have twice issued provisional suspensions to the Russian athletes banned by the IOC, only to have to lift their sanctions based on legal advice.
A number of those banned Russians – including Alexander Kasjanov, whose ban by the IOC last week effectively facilitated Jackson’s rise to bronze – are competing in the IBSF World Cup in Winterberg this weekend.
“It’s a difficult one and I imagine the atmosphere at the track might sometimes get a little bit uncomfortable,” Jackson said. “But as an athlete you’ve just got to focus on getting on with business and leave the rest to the bodies concerned.”
The British Olympic Association also backed the move, calling it “the right decision”. The BOA chairman, Sir Hugh Robertson, said: “We take no pleasure in the outcome of the IOC Commissions. However, the IOC has taken the right decision.”
If Jackson’s bronze medal is ratified, it will make Sochi 2014 the most successful Winter Olympics in British history, eclipsing the four medals won at the inaugural event in Chamonix in 1924. A number of British athletes, most notably the reigning Olympic skeleton gold medallist Lizzy Yarnold, have led the fight for fairness in the wake of the McLaren report into state-sponsored doping.
And BOA Athletes’ Commission chairman Ben Hawes said he hoped the decision would provide some solace to athletes such as Jackson who were denied their moments of glory in Sochi. Hawes said: “Based on the findings of the independent reports commissioned by the IOC we believe this ban is the correct and appropriate outcome. We are optimistic this decision will send a clear message to both athletes and officials who have cheated.
“We now place great importance on the work of the IOC panel to determine clean athletes to compete in PyeongChang 2018, and in doing so hope they give our athletes the confidence that they line up in a clean competition against the best in the world. Our disappointment still remains for those athletes robbed of medals and precious moments in Sochi 2014 and other Olympic Games.”
The World Olympians Association also welcomed the IOC’s decision, but stressed the rights of Russian athletes untainted by doping should not be compromised.
In a statement, the WOA said: “World Olympians Association welcomes the decision made by the IOC executive board and the due process followed to ensure the individual rights of clean athletes are protected.
“World Olympians Association takes the fight against doping extremely seriously and is determined to see cheats driven out to ensure a level playing field for all Olympians.
“But we reiterate our stance that, where possible, individual justice should be applied to ensure clean athletes are not unfairly punished.”


Ryan Shazier has thanked those who sent him messages of support after he suffered a spinal injury during Monday night’s game against the Cincinnati Bengals.
The Pittsburgh Steelers linebacker was hurt while making a tackle and was treated on the field for several minutes receiving treatment from medical staff. He did not appear to have any movement in the lower half of his body as he was strapped to a board and carted off the field. Shazier was still at the University of Cincinnati Medical Center on Tuesday night as doctors continue to monitor him and carry out tests.
“He will continue to be monitored and treated by the neurosurgery experts at UC Medical Center until he has been cleared to return to Pittsburgh,” said a statement from the University of Cincinnati Medical Center and University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. “It is expected that Ryan will undergo additional tests and evaluation over the next 24 to 48 hours, and he will then return to Pittsburgh to receive further evaluation and care at UPMC.”
NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport says Shazier has regained “some movement in his lower extremities” although the extent of his injury is still unclear as doctors evaluate the 25-year-old further.
Thank you for the prayers. Your support is uplifting to me and my family. #SHALIEVE
On Tuesday night Shazier tweeted his thanks to supporters. “Thank you for the prayers. Your support is uplifting to me and my family,” he wrote on Twitter.
Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin said it has been a difficult time for the team. “It was a tough evening. Ryan is a trooper,” Tomlin said on Tuesday. “[I] had an opportunity to spend some time with him; he is in really good spirits, tough guy. He has great support from family and loved ones there. It was painful to get on that plane last night. That’s life. We realize and understand he is in really good hands and getting expert medical care. He also challenged us to move on with what it is we need to move on, and he is with us as well.”
Shazier’s injury came during a brutal game between the Bengals and Steelers, whose rivalry goes back years. Monday night’s game was particularly ugly – in addition to Shazier’s injury, two players were given one-game suspensions for illegal hits.


There’s a hugely culturally important scene in the movie So I Married An Axe Murderer, where Mike Myers (playing his own dad) explains How Stuff Works to his son’s friend. “Well,” he barks, “it’s a well-known fact, sonny Jim, that there’s a secret society of the five wealthiest people in the world known as The Pentaverate, who run everything in the world, including the newspapers, and who meet triannually at a secret country mansion in Colorado known as … The Meadows.” The friend humours him by asking who’s in this Pentaverate. “The Queen, the Vatican, the Gettys, the Rothschilds,” comes the reply, “AND Colonel Sanders before he went tits up …”
I was reminded of this when I read of the latest theory about football bias: in this case, the notion that Match of the Day pundits, including Ian Wright, are biased against Arsenal. This claim is hotly disputed – mostly by the pundits in question, but also, tacitly, by all the fans of other clubs who know that, actually, it’s their club against which Match of the Day is biased. And the newspapers and the referees. Well – I have news. But before we go any further I want you to be absolutely sure that you want to take football’s reddest pill, because there’s really no going back once you have. OK?
OK. If you’re still with me, prepare to have your mind blown – because it’s all TRUE. It’s a massive conspiracy, and it’s bigger than you can possibly imagine. It’s not just the referees that hate your club – it is, as you suspected, the newspapers, the websites, the television programmes, and the Match of the Day pundits too. And Colonel Sanders before he went tits up.
No doubt you’ll immediately want to know how this thing you knew you were right about works. So please join me over at my wall of pictures of players, ex-players and officials – and Colonel Sanders – all linked by lengths of yarn in the manner of one of those LSD spider’s webs. Put simply, the fact that Wright is biased against Arsenal shows you the power and reach of his puppetmaster organisation: it is able to embed individuals in football clubs for many years, in several cases allowing them to rise to the status of legends. Only when they are on the Match of the Day sofa and faced with a 3-1 loss to Manchurian United – sorry, Manchester United – are they activated. In a very real sense, their entire career has been leading up to this moment of commentary and the training just kicks in. No emotions, no deviations from the script. Ice-cold. It’s just too damn important.
And it’s equally important the conspiracy holds, meanwhile, which is why They spend almost as much time gaslighting you. Those blank looks your mates who support other clubs give you? They are behind those. They basically control your friends. Now, I know that you’re going to have one final question, which is in many ways the big one. Namely: why is it just my club (whichever that club may be)? Why are all these entities so biased against just your club, because you’d definitely notice and say something if you thought they were biased against another club, as opposed to biased towards them (which is another thing you suspect)? That, I concede, is the one bit I haven’t pieced together. Yet. But the truth is out there – somewhere – and the minute I know more, so will you.
Speaking of puppetmasters, it is always a pleasure to hear from that wonderful old ham Mark Clattenburg, who has been talking to NBC’s Men in Blazers podcast. The last we heard of Mark, he was calling a press conference in Jeddah to announce his sensational signing as head of refereeing in Saudi Arabia, where he was going to “support and educate” local referees. Fortunately, he seems to have escaped the crown prince’s recent “anti-corruption” purge – indeed, knowing Clattenburg, he may even have taken partial credit for it.
This week he was taking credit for something else, though. His interview with Men In Blazers and its fallout contained the usual third person references to himself, but its most ear-catching moment was the bit where Mark explained he’d “allowed Tottenham to self-destruct” during the 2016 2-2 draw with Chelsea during which Spurs conceded the title to Leicester. Let’s see that claim in action: “I allowed them [Spurs] to self-destruct so all the media, all the people in the world went: ‘Tottenham lost the title.’”
“Some referees would have played by the book,” Mark went on. “Tottenham would have been down to seven or eight players and probably lost and they would’ve been looking for an excuse. But I didn’t give them an excuse, because my gameplan was: let them lose the title.”
For those who’ve occasionally wondered what goes through a referee’s head at certain moments, it’s instructive to learn that Mark was storyboarding his notional next day’s press cuttings as he declined to deal too harshly with any Tottenham miscreants. As he put it: “If I sent three players off from Tottenham, what are the headlines? ‘Clattenburg cost Tottenham the title.’” And that’s just the News at Ten.
Anyway, Mark’s next statement served to remind us that he is an impresario first, and a referee second, as he declared: “It was pure theatre that Tottenham self-destructed against Chelsea and Leicester won the title.” Put like that, the fact he was overlooked for a Tony award feels even more criminal than ever. What a Prospero figure he is, and we can only hope he stages more revels at his very earliest opportunity.


Bleak as life can seem when you’re lying awake in the middle of the night, it’s an immutable truth that everything will be better in the morning. Everything, that is, but English cricket. Hope didn’t even make it to sun-up, it slipped out the door while you were sleeping. And all of us poor fools who set our alarms for 3.30am found that all the bright optimism that got us out of bed was spluttering as soon as we’d flicked the kettle on, guttering while the tea brewed, and out altogether by the bottom of the cup. The idea that England might break their own record and make 354 to win lasted just under three overs. Long enough for Josh Hazlewood to pinch a couple of wickets, and, with them, England out of their dreaming.
Following England can be a masochistic business. Why do it? Jim Laker had a good answer. It took him 11 years and 46 Tests to solve a question that has vexed critics, philosophers and American tourists for over a hundred years. “The aim of English Test cricket”, Laker wrote, “is, in fact, mainly to beat Australia.” Half a century later, India are the best team in the world and the ECB is contorting the summer schedules to try to help the one-day side finally win the World Cup. But, in the thick of another Ashes series, it feels like there’s a measure more truth in Laker’s take than some of the more discerning fans might like to let on. English cricket’s prayer is still: “Please let us beat them”.
For now it’s back to living on scraps, talking up the little glimmers of good things done in this match: James Anderson’s first five-for in Australia, Craig Overton’s all-round performance on debut, those gritty little teens, 20s and 30s by Mark Stoneman and Dawid Malan. After that, on with concocting far-fetched schemes for the Waca: fanciful thoughts about whether Mark Wood, who has only bowled 14 overs in the last two months, might yet tear through Australia, whether Ben Foakes, who’s never played so much as a T20 game for England, or Gary Ballance, who averages 13 in his last five Tests, could fix the English middle-order.
Which feels like chickenfeed to live on, given the larger problems. Unless they’re playing under floodlights, England’s attack are out-matched in these conditions, especially so when their two senior pros, Anderson and Stuart Broad, make the mistake of bowling as short as they did in the first innings here. On top of that, their batsmen have lost the knack of scoring centuries. In the last two years, England have made many more fifties per match than any other team in the world, but fewer hundreds per match than most of them too. The only team with a worse conversion rate in that time is Bangladesh.
The hope now isn’t so much that they might yet win the series. Even all us early-bird followers surely aren’t so foolhardy to really think they can do that now. But instead, that they will hold themselves together, fight as hard for five days as they did in the first three days in Brisbane and on the fourth in Adelaide, and win a match somewhere along the way. Talking on the BBC on Monday, Matt Prior explained that he didn’t think it much mattered whether the team was whitewashed or not. In his mind there was little difference between losing 3-2 or 5-0, since the only important point was that they’d lost at all. But England should beware thinking that way.
All those dashed English expectations tend to lead to severe recriminations. The last two English coaches whose teams lost series in Australia lost their jobs too. Duncan Fletcher quit after the World Cup the spring following his side’s whitewash. Six years later, Andy Flower went as well, after another 5-0 thrashing. Those defeats seemed to be so damaging that it took months of intensive repair work for the team to recover. In 2007 the ECB commissioned a six-man panel to conduct an investigation into what went wrong, and 2013 was the start of that rolling omnishambles which saw them sack their star batsman, hire and fire both a new coach and director of cricket.
Ashes whitewashes can end careers, for captains, coaches, and players. Eight of the 20 men England picked in 2013-14 never played a Test for them again. “There are some capital winners out here,” sniffed Lord Harris when he toured Australia in the 19th century, “but I’m afraid I cannot apply the same adjective to them as losers.” Bad as Australia may have been then, England have been dismal at it in the last decade, in a different way. Each Ashes series defeat seems to become a kind of generational trauma that leaves the team in therapy. And even before England lost this second Test, you could feel the wellspring of angst, blame, and complaint bubbling up.
Last week it was the concerns about the team culture, whether or not it had grown too lax or the players were too fond of their booze, this week it was the worry about their lack of fast bowlers. And this last issue, you guess, could get particularly messy given that the next Test is at the Waca. And if that all seems a little bleak, the sun’s up now, and that scorecard isn’t looking any prettier.

Florence, the city of lilies, is the perfect getaway for anyone yearning for a peaceful weekend in the tranquil surroundings of Tuscany. It has the Uffizi Gallery, the Arno river and those famous red top buildings. It is also the home of 18-year-old English forward Ellie Brazil, who left Birmingham City in the FA Women’s Super League this summer to sign for Serie A champions Fiorentina.
Like fellow England youngster Katie Zelem, who moved to Juventus during the summer, Brazil was swayed by the idea of sampling a new culture. “The first two months I was here it was still summer, so it was gorgeous,” says the 18-year-old. “It’s just a different lifestyle. A few years ago I moved to Birmingham, away from my friends and parents, so it wasn’t something that scared me. It drove me to do it, to gain more independence and gain more life experience.”
Fiorentina won the league by eight points last season, so Brazil has a lot of competition in the squad, but having to force her way into the team hasn’t dampened her enthusiasm. “It’s going well in the sense of getting experiences that I would never have got in England,” she says. “I obviously wish I was playing more than I am, but I think that will come. The Italian is coming on slowly. Coming here meant promising my parents I would learn Italian and I do enjoy it.
“The coach speaks English but the manager doesn’t, so it’s still a bit of a translation phase. A lot of the girls speak English, but they’re very strict on the fact they want me to learn Italian. I’ve moved to their country so I have to mould myself into their lifestyle and their culture. I’m learning the key words you need to know on the pitch: shoot, turn, pass, left, right, up, down. I’ve finally nailed those.”
Despite testing out tennis, badminton, table tennis and athletics as a child, Ellie was only ever going to be a footballer. She is the daughter of Gary Brazil, the former Preston North End, Fulham and Newcastle United player who was also caretaker boss of Nottingham Forest earlier this year, and her older brother Jack is currently coaching in the Cayman Islands.
“Football started when I was born,” she says. “I was born into a family obsessed with football. From the age of three, I was in goal in the back garden with my brother pelting balls at me. I always loved football. My brother has been my biggest fan since day one and he’ll always be my biggest fan. He’s doing incredibly well out in Grand Cayman and he’s always been amazing with me, he supports me better than anyone.”
At 15, while part of the Derby County academy, Brazil won the 800 metres at the 2015 English School’s Athletics Championship and had an option to go down the athletics route but one ambition swung her towards football. “The idea of playing at a World Cup was what I thought about. I never expected to be living in Florence, but at that time it was the World Cup that made me choose football.”
Brazil realised that ambition last year, when she represented England at the U17 Women’s World Cup in Jordan. “Playing there and seeing my parents in the stands and scoring a goal with my nan in the crowd was an experience I’ll never forget. I’m glad I made the right choice.”
England were dealt a tough hand in Jordan. Drawn in a group with the mighty Brazil, a talented Nigeria side and eventual winners North Korea, England battled through with a draw and two wins before being knocked out by finalists Japan in the quarter-finals. “We went into the tournament like any other team: we wanted to win. We had no expectation because we weren’t named as the favourites. We were the underdogs and got given the hardest group, but that drove us even more. In that tournament, you saw players play better than they’ve ever done before and it was incredible to be a part of it. We were part of a team nobody will forget.”
“Going out against the Japanese was hard. We did so well against Korea [drawing 3-3] and we thought they’d be similar to that. After the game we all agreed that we got outplayed. It was heartbreaking, but we also couldn’t put into words what it felt like to get to a quarter-final. We wanted to get to the semi-finals because we felt if we did we could get to the final, so to be that close and not get there was devastating.”
Their next chance is just around the corner, as the team have qualified for the Under-20 World Cup, which will be held in France next August. Before that, Brazil and her team-mates go to Florida next month to face USA, Brazil and Finland in a trio of friendlies to prepare for the tournament. “We’re all very excited,” she says. “The girls are like a second family. We have WhatsApp groups, Snapchat groups, we’re always in contact to see how everyone’s doing. It will be lovely to see everyone. When I’m with them is when I’m happiest. Everyone’s very excitable in our group chats at the moment with regards to going to Florida. We didn’t expect to go there just before Christmas and the teams we’ll be playing are World Cup standard.”
Twelve months ago, Brazil was just about finding her feet with Birmingham City. She was given her big break when David Parker stepped down as manager stepped down and was replaced by academy coach Marc Skinner, who immediately gave Brazil more opportunities. Her form helped her earn a place for the biggest club occasion of all, the Women’s FA Cup final at Wembley, just months after her 18th birthday.
City won the game 4-1 but Brazil remembers the day fondly. “In regards to Marc, I cannot thank that man enough for the opportunities he gave me, but Wembley specifically. It was just incredible, when we were walking around the pitch the day before, it was just like ‘wow’. Me and Charlie [Wellings] were sat there and it felt like we were playing Fifa. It just didn’t seem like it was actually happening.”
With Birmingham trailing 3-0, Skinner brought on Brazil’s close friend Wellings for the final 25 minutes so she could soak up the atmosphere. Brazil set up Wellings for Birmingham’s goal. “The result might not have gone our way, but it was an experience I’m never going to forget,” recalls Brazil. “Charlie coming on was amazing: best friends, two youngsters. We always said if we got on together we’d just enjoy it, so when the ball went in the net, that’s a feeling I’ll never forget. Whether it was 3-0 or 15-0, we’d still to this day get excited about that goal. Hopefully one day we can go back there and recreate it, whether it’s for the same team or a different team.”
After coming so close to winning the FA Cup, it was difficult for Brazil to leave Birmingham and Skinner. “It was horrible,” she says. “It was possibly one of the hardest things I’ve had to do, and that’s not me being clichéd. Marc is a very supportive guy. He still messages me now to make sure I’m alright. We’re in contact and I watch every Blues game I can. It was hard to leave the team and leave Marc because he was very good with me. If I hadn’t played in those games, I might not have ended up where I am now.”
Her new challenge is to keep Fiorentina at the top of the Italian game and enjoy her first Champions League campaign. “I do feel like I’m settling into it more now. It’s made me a stronger, more independent person. I don’t have to rely on my parents; I can rely on myself. I don’t know how long I’ll be here. As much as I love Italy, I’ve come here to learn the technical side of the game. Once I’ve done that and developed that, I do see myself moving on elsewhere. I’m not 100% sure where and that’s what’s exciting about the future.”
Despite her lack of minutes on the pitch, Brazil is now finding her feet with her new team. She scored her first league goal against Sassuolo in October before scoring her first goal in the Champions League in November against Bundesliga champions Wolfsburg. Coming off the pitch, she was greeted by a tonne of messages from friends, team-mates and journalists back home, as well as the official Uefa Women’s Champions League account. “It is very surreal at times,” she laughs. “But I appreciate it all when I go on Twitter and see all the support, even from the Birmingham fans. I’ll appreciate that forever. It’s lovely seeing that people are following you. The Wolfsburg match was definitely one I’ll never forget. I can’t just class that as another game.”
She has no doubt that she made the right choice to move abroad. “I’m not just learning how to play football, but a new language and growing as a person every day. I’m even learning how to cook – my parents will never believe that I’m learning to cook.”

“After the north London derby, a friend and I were imagining what some of the world’s most unlikely split scarves might be,” writes Chris Corrigan. “It’s fun to imagine, but in real life, what are examples of unbelievably unlikely split scarves?”
Pitch up outside any major match and you are likely to find someone hawking a half-and-half scarf. We’ve riffed on the subject before and, nightmarish scourge or natty souvenir, they don’t seem to be going anywhere. Inevitably they continue to split opinion, though not exactly down the middle (your more extreme response), but judging from some of your suggestions, they remain increasingly unlikely.
Reader Tim Grey offered up this 2013 vintage:
@TheKnowledge_GU Regarding unlikely half-and-half scarves, I really can't fathom who these blokes thought would buy these monstrosities. They're not likely to win you any friends in either city... pic.twitter.com/FsVkIquBuB

A niche one nobody saw coming?
James Walker offers a cracker. “I am a proud owner of a scarf from a Europa League qualifying-round match between Prestatyn Town and the now-defunct Latvian side Liepaijas Metalurgs,” he mails. And there’s photo evidence, too:
But, as Paul Fulcher points out, there is probably an unexpected winner. “Given one club was formed as a protest against the existence of the other,” he begins, “an AFC Wimbledon and MK Dons half and half scarf has to be a contender for the ultimate abomination, but someone thought it was a good idea.”
Of course, there is a natural progression …

“If the FA Cup replays involving non-league sides go to form, there will be no non-league sides in the third round: when was the last time that happened?” asks Richard Powell.
It has never happened since the third round was introduced in 1925-26, Richard. Back in 2015-16, Eastleigh flew the flag as sole non-leaguers, but this season could see the first blank yet. With Hereford FC facing Fleetwood Town in the final replay, it could rest on their shoulders.
“Has a caretaker manager ever been sacked other than being replaced by a permanent manager? Just thinking about David Unsworth,” asks David Collins.
“In November 2011, Gary Johnson was sacked by Northampton,” notes Daniel Brownsill. “David Lee was appointed as caretaker manager and was sacked after one game (a 7-2 loss at home to Shrewsbury). He was replaced by Tim Flowers as caretaker for one game (a 4-1 loss at Plymouth) before Aidy Boothroyd was appointed as manager. So, four games in a row with four different managers. Has there been an instance of five games in a row with five different managers?”
“Schalke’s second-half comeback from 4-0 down to drawing 4-4 with Dortmund got me thinking: what is the biggest goals deficit a team has come back from to earn a point or win a game in a second half?” asks George Jones.
“On 29 August 1960 my brother and I witnessed Bristol Rovers drawing 4-4 with Leeds United in a second division league game,” recalls Ted Keene. “Leeds, with Albert Johannesson in the side, led 4-0 at half-time. Rovers hit back to make it 4-4 with Graeme Ricketts missing a sitter which would have won it. A delight for my brother and me since all the goals were in the same net in front of us. (Eastville rose beds separating the goal from the terraces).”
To the 2010 Africa Cup of Nations. “In the opening game, Mali came from 4-0 down to draw 4-4 with Angola – but the first goal in the comeback didn’t come until the 79th minute,” notes Mark Cookney. “This game was made all the more legendary by rumours circulating on forums of a student blowing his entire student loan backing Angola to win while they were four up.”
Dirk Maas has another offering: “One of the most remarkable comebacks must have been the VfL Bochum v Bayern Munich on 18 September 1976. Bochum led 3-0 at half-time and added another in the 53th minute. Bayern somehow managed to get back in the game: between the 54th and 76th minute they scored five. Bochum refused to give up and equalised in the 80th minute. Bayern, however, got the winner in the 89th minute.” Then, of course, there was this.
Last week, we looked at the shortest time between a player featuring for an age group national team and the full team. But one instance slipped through the net …
“I have a feeling Massimo Maccarone did something similar to Pierre Littbarski just before the 2002 World Cup,” begins Alasdair Brookman, correctly. “He played (and scored) against England under-21s, and then made his senior debut for Italy against England at Elland Road the very next day. He was even brought down for the last-minute penalty from which Italy won.”
Gavin Buckland has another quick tale. “It’s worth noting that in February 1978 during a B international against England in Augsburg, West Germany’s Ronald Worm came off the bench to equalise, before 24 hours later repeating the feat for the full national team against the same opponents in Munich. The only difference was the result: England won the B game 2-1, but lost 2-1 in the full international.”
“Has any other football team played 11 triallists like Hereford United did this summer?” posed Steve Hodges in 2014.
With the threat of liquidation lingering, it was no surprise to see Hereford fielding triallist XIs against Droylsden and, rather oddly, Besiktas in pre-season. There was understandably little mirth to be found in the reaction to those friendly teams.
But not so at Hyde FC. “Last month Hyde FC played a team of completely traillists for the third-or-so time in a row,” wrote John Jacques. “It was getting confusing keeping track of the names … so they started naming the players after actors and such.” Having named a team of revolutionaries for the fixture against Altrincham – Fidel Castro, Vladimir Lenin, Karl Marx, Leon Trotsky, Maximilien de Robespierre and so forth – mixed in with a couple of contracted players, a triallist XI took the field against Burnley in their following fixture …

“With Nigeria drawn in the same World Cup group as Argentina for the fifth time out of six, I was wondering whether there were other examples of teams consistently drawing each other?” enquires Will Hughes.
“Spain. Portugal. Morocco and Iran: the geographically closest World Cup group ever?” asks Doug Coyle.
“I seem to remember, in the early 2000s, that Arsenal had three different strips with three different sponsors; their home kit displayed Dreamcast, their away kit, then gold, was emblazoned with JVC and their third kit, a navy blue number, showed Sega on the front,” writes Elliot Leaver. “Can someone confirm if this is true and, if so, whether any other clubs have had similar scenarios?”
“In the National League clash between FC Halifax Town and Eastleigh both goalkeepers were given red cards for two bookable offences,” writes Rob Green. “Has this occurred before?”
“Who was the last footballer to play a competitive game wearing glasses?” muses Justus Mwaniki.


Steve Smith decided to pop a sleeping tablet on Tuesday night following a rather stressful day at work. No judgment: we’ve all been there. But in the end, all it took to improve the Australian captain’s mood were a couple of Josh Hazlewood’s finest pills.
“I was a little bit nervous last night,” Smith said after his side’s victory, his tone a mix of relief and candour. “It’s been a pretty tough 24 hours. It’s all part of being captain of your country. Sometimes you’re going to make the wrong decision. It’s part of a learning experience. I’ll reflect on some things I can improve in my leadership and captaincy.”
Playing on his mind, he explained, was the follow-on he elected not to enforce, the stumble of his batsmen in the second dig, and that he had skittishly binned two DRS referrals in the space of three balls. Ample to keep any skipper awake. But bigger than all those problems combined was Joe Root, unbeaten on 67 at the close. “I had to have a sleeping pill,” he joked.
Enter Josh Hazlewood; far from the man most likely in the early exchanges of this series, but the quick that Smith entrusted with the first over of the final day. The default option would have been throwing the ball to Nathan Lyon, with whom he can set and forget for the accuracy and confidence he is bowling with currently. Or Pat Cummins for raw power.
Instead, 20 minutes before play Smith told Hazlewood he would be the one. It was a call vindicated before the Barmy Army had even finished singing Jerusalem to mark the start of play. With a piece of textbook seam, he squared up Chris Woakes, the ball gently kissing his outside edge. It was beautiful cricket.
Hazlewood’s series may have started slowly, and summer too, after a side strain he picked up in Bangladesh hung around a touch longer than anticipated, but at last he was front and centre. As for England, their swollen hopes of a miracle were lumped further onto Root.
How did Hazlewood feel about carrying that early responsibility? “You wait for these moments in games to go out there and stamp your authority,” he recalled. “There were a few nerves as well as excitement for the opportunity to win a Test.”
When, with his 11th delivery he drew an indecisive response from England’s skipper to find his edge too, it was an opportunity he had grasped.
“I could breathe a little more easily then,” Smith said of the telling moment. “Josh probably hasn’t been bowling as well as I’ve seen him bowl and I think he knows that. But this morning I thought the lengths that he came out and bowled were exceptional.”
Those lengths were some 0.8 metres fuller on average than in the first innings, according to CricViz. “That’s Josh Hazlewood, that’s what he does,” continued Smith. “He bowls that length day in, day out. He doesn’t try to swing the ball too much, just hits the seam, gets a bit of movement both ways.” Easy, when you put it like that.
He also bowled gas. On average, Hazlewood sent them down at 88.1mph in Adelaide compared to 85.5mph at Brisbane. So, a yard quicker in addition to landing a yard fuller. It was also the fastest he’s bowled through a match in three years, again with numbers crunched by CricViz.
After picking up Woakes, he unfurled at 92.2mph to Johnny Bairstow first up, a reading that surprised even himself. “Obviously there was adrenalin running through the body with a couple of wickets there as well,” he said. “My rhythm was really good. So I’m pretty happy with that.”
Speaking of pills, it took Mitchell Starc a single attempt to cash in with the second pink one through more pace and hoop. From there, the attack-leader did what he does best: steamrolling the tail and finishing with a bag of five. Early baths for all.
Sure enough, before it was done Lyon was into the action too, just as he has been at every available opportunity in 2017. Moeen Ali was the England left-hander he would have his way with this time, the all-rounder sweeping indiscriminately and missing unflatteringly.
The Lyon stat of the day: he now has 38 wickets in most recent five Tests – one more than Mitchell Johnson took in 2013-14 Ashes, by way of comparison. “Nathan is bowling as well as I’ve seen,” Smith gushed of his tweaker.
With a two-nil lead in his pocket he won’t need any assistance nodding off tonight, an Ashes-winning victory at Perth deservedly in his dreams.


Joe Root described his England team as being “massively” still in their series with Australia and in better shape than the team that was whitewashed four years ago despite going 2-0 down in their Ashes defence, and with history now heavily against them.
Hopes of a record run chase in the second Test were dashed early on the final day when, resuming 178 runs shy, they lost their final six wickets for 57. Josh Hazlewood claimed the wickets of Chris Woakes and Root in his first 11 balls and Mitchell Starc finished with five.
A rampant Australia now head to their Ashes stronghold of Perth – England have won there just once, against a Packer-depleted side in 1978 – but Root, though frustrated by his side’s sluggish start to the Test with ball and then bat, tried to remain upbeat.
“I thought we showed a lot of character which is what you want to see in big series,” said the England captain. “It is now about finding a way to do it over five days. The way that we went about the second innings proved to everyone really we are still massively in this series.”
On comparisons with the 2013-14 side, humbled 5-0 under Alastair Cook, Root replied: “I think we are playing better cricket. I don’t think we are as unevenly matched as we were. We have been in control for periods. I don’t think necessarily that was the case last time around.”
Root, caught behind off Hazlewood without adding to his overnight 67, admitted to be concerned about a lack of converted half-centuries personally – just 13 of his 47 have been turned into hundreds – but England’s issues clearly run deeper than his own Achilles heel.
Though Root was unrepentant over his decision to bowl first on day one, his attack’s inability to get their lengths right first time around saw Steve Smith’s side post 442 for eight declared. It left the Test an uphill struggle that even a third innings fightback led by Jimmy Anderson’s maiden five-wicket haul in Australia could not overcome.
The batting is most worrying, with no centuries so far, Jonny Bairstow looking too low at No7 and Nathan Lyon feasting on England’s left-handers. They have made up 10 of the off-spinner’s 11 wickets, including Moeen Ali in all four innings to date.
Root said: “We have to make sure we have decent game-plans and counter [Lyon] in practice to make sure we are ready for it when it comes round to the Test matches. It is about making sure you are clear about how you go about playing him individually. Do that then we will be in a very good place.”
Trevor Bayliss, the head coach, insisted Australia still have frailties, pointing to centuries by Smith in Brisbane and Shaun Marsh here being the chief difference. And yet the home side have past performers yet to fire, while Mark Stoneman, James Vince and Dawid Malan are still to taste three-figures at Test level at all.
On what that trio in particular must now do, Bayliss replied: “They have scored 30s, 40s, 50s. If you have made a fifty, which they have, you’ve just got to do it again. It’s about going through that ceiling and doing it twice.”
In contrast to Lyon, Moeen’s form with the ball – two wickets at 98 apiece – is vexing for Root and Bayliss. Though the bulk of England’s XI can rest during the two-day match in Perth from Saturday, the all-rounder, left done by side and finger issues, is down to play while Cook, after a slow start, may well opt to join him.
Mark Wood, the Durham quick, is expected to play also along with England’s Test reserves and some of the Lions squad. But an encouraging debut of four wickets and an unbeaten 41 from Craig Overton has left Bayliss minded to keep an unchanged side for the third Test that starts on 14 December as the WACA hosts its final Ashes match.
Bayliss added: “Somewhere along the line we will win a game and it will mean so much to them. It will make them believe they are good enough. When that happens we will be able to go on and get many more wins in those situations.”


David Moyes is giving strong consideration to dropping Joe Hart against Chelsea on Saturday, casting doubt over the West Ham United goalkeeper’s status as England’s No1.
Hart’s form has been erratic since his loan move from Manchester City in the summer and his absence from last Sunday’s defeat by his parent club offered a rare chance to Adrián, who produced an assured performance on his first Premier League start of the season. Moyes was impressed with the Spaniard, who frustrated City with several fine saves, and it is thought that the 30-year-old has done enough to keep his place for the visit of Chelsea this weekend.
That would be a major setback for Hart, whose England place is under pressure before next summer’s World Cup. Gareth Southgate, England’s manager, has made it clear to his squad that they need to be playing regularly for their clubs and he has strong competition in goal, with Everton’s Jordan Pickford and Stoke City’s Jack Butland improving all the time.
Hart, who earns £120,000 a week, had hoped to revive his career at West Ham after being cast aside by Pep Guardiola. However the 30-year-old, who was inconsistent during a loan spell at Torino last season, has struggled despite arriving in east London to much fanfare. West Ham remain hopeful that they will still see the best of him, but their concerns have grown. Hart has conceded 30 goals in 14 matches and was heavily criticised after last week’s 4-0 defeat by Everton at Goodison Park.
West Ham are in 19th place before hosting Chelsea, have conceded the most goals in the Premier League and have not won since Moyes replaced Slaven Bilic last month, but they produced a better defensive performance against City. Adrián was a big part of that and there were already calls for him to start more regularly after he starred in the Carabao Cup win over Tottenham Hotspur in October. He is a popular figure with West Ham’s supporters and Moyes, who is determined to stamp out complacency within his squad, does not want to send out the wrong message by bringing Hart straight back into the side.
Moyes, who has picked up one point in his first four matches, will leave it late before reaching a final decision, but all signs are pointing towards Hart facing a fight to win back his place from Adrián.


At the end of this occasionally heated, largely room temperature night of make-or-break Champions League football Atlético Madrid’s travelling fans could be seen still singing in the away end 20 minutes after the final whistle, scarves twirling, flags draped, a wall of consolatory red and white.
Atlético may have just failed to reach the knockout stages for the first time in seven seasons after this 1-1 draw. They may have looked blunt, a powerhouse whose resources have been stretched, with a team who have aged together. But this is a club built on that same collective will and heart that made the creaky, grubby Vicente Calderón such an uplifting place to visit. You can’t kill the spirit and there was a warmth to the end notes here on a night that left Diego Simeone taciturn and glowering – or rather, even more taciturn and glowering – as he picked over his team’s exit.
And really, there were no winners. Antonio Conte was bullish afterwards but Chelsea will be hugely disappointed at their inability to finish top of Group C having started so brightly with a win in Madrid. They are now likely to play one of Barcelona, PSG, Besiktas or RB Leipzig in the last 16, not a difficult choice given half a chance to warm the Uefa balls.
There are reasons to be hopeful whoever Chelsea end up playing. Eden Hazard was the best player on the pitch. Even at this level of competition he will trouble any opponent, such is the extreme quality of his dribbling, his acceleration on the half-turn, and that astonishing lateral spring, the ability to move with more shark-like purpose than any other player on the park.
He produced the best moment of the match, haring forward from just past the centre circle, leaving four defenders in his wake, two literally on their backsides. He created the equaliser shortly afterwards, sprinting from the same inside-left position, legs pounding the turf with a controlled fury, and seeing his low cross put through his own goal by Stefan Savic.
If Chelsea can proceed as a dark horse, a team no one will really fancy playing, it is Atlético who were the real story, finalists in two of the last four seasons, and a club flush with ambition and new money, but eliminated from the top table without much of a whimper.
It isn’t hard to diagnose the problems on the pitch. At half time it was hard to fight the suggestion both teams were missing Diego Costa, that both could have done with a little of the old wild man on the pitch, jabbing Gary Cahill in the kidneys at one end, foraging more forcefully than the stealthy Alvaro Morata at the other, perhaps even managing to go head to head with himself at some stage in a furious finger-jabbing Diego‑on-Diego bust-up. Instead Fernando Torres played up front again for Atlético, a slimmed down Torres, game and slick in his movements even aged 33. Torres had a hand in Atlético’s goal as they began to chug up through the gears early in the second half. The big screen at Stamford Bridge had just broadcast the news of Roma taking the lead at home to Qarabag. Moments later Atlético scored, Saúl heading in from Torres’ flick after a corner, helped by some anaemic Chelsea defending.
Atlético were always riding two horses with the same backside, charged not just with beating Chelsea but with hoping Qarabag , thrashed 6-0 on this ground, could go to Rome and win. Saúl celebrated wildly with the crowd, showing a great deal more faith in the Azerbaijan champions’ ability to pull one back in Rome than most neutral observers.
The key was probably in the detail This was Atlético’s sixth goal in six games in this group. With Antoine Griezmann quiet, they looked like a team set up to strangle their opponents then kill them with a little razor edge on the break, but lacking the sharpness to make those attacking details count. Here Simeone lamented the missed chances against Qarabag, 10 of them in a 1-1 draw.
It is no secret Atlético have suffered though the cost of building the Wanda Metropolitano stadium and a transfer ban imposed at the moment this group of players started to fray at the edges. Atlético are still surging on in La Liga, only six points behind Barcelona, and the wheel will turn again. The new stadium, the powerful backers, Simeone’s talent: there is an inevitability about this combination of elements. But lost years can take their toll, the need to grow constantly, to reboot and refresh a squad should not be underestimated.
For all their fine passing and movement there was an element of the trapped wasp under a glass about them here. Simeone was up patrolling his stretch of white line from the start, whirling and fretting and barking helplessly in his shiny black coat and skinny suit, like an ageing mafia sicario desperately hailing a cab in the rain. A drop down into the Europa League will provide a formidable heavyweight presence for Uefa’s second-string Thursday night crowd, not to mention time for Simeone to make sure his team are back in this competition next year, refreshed and ready to start a new cycle in the club’s history.
For Chelsea the Champions League’s return in February will be a fascinating prospect. Much of the club’s success, its sense of itself, is built around progress in this competition, but it has been a decelerating ride. Even with Atlético safely put away, the last top European team Chelsea beat at the Bridge was Paris Saint-Germain three and a half years ago, a match José Mourinho memorably turned on its head by loading the front of his team with big men and hoofing it long to Demba Ba. The real tests await this team, although as Conte pointed out, it is hard to imagine too many of Europe’s heavyweights will fancy crossing their path.


Serena Williams is “very likely” to return to Melbourne for the 2018 Australian Open, according to tournament director Craig Tiley.
Williams gave birth to her first child, Alexis Olympia Ohanian Jr, during the 2017 US Open, and has not competed professionally since she won her 23rd Grand Slam singles title at the Australian Open earlier this year.
She has been in training since the birth with new hitting partner Jarmere Jenkins, but coach Patrick Mouratoglou said last week that she had not yet made a decision on whether she would compete for her eighth Australian Open singles title.
Tiley, however, was much more enthusiastic when asked about the prospect at a Tennis Australia event to announce that NBL clubs Melbourne United and Cairns Taipans would play a game on Hisense Arena during the Australian Open.
“She has got her visa, she has entered, she’s practicing, and she probably just needs a bit more space for a bigger entourage,” Tiley said.
“There is no question she will be ready in our view.
“She wants to break the record owned by Margaret Court and it would be a significant accomplishment.”
Court won a record 24 Grand Slam singles titles. Nonetheless, she continues to attract controversy for her views on a range of topics, including marriage equality, and comments earlier this year that “tennis is full of lesbians”.
Most recently, Tina Arena drew attention to the spectre of the name of Court’s arena being changed as Ashleigh Barty was awarded the Newcombe Medal for 2017.


Lionel Messi can’t make his mind up. Last week he wanted Barcelona to sign Philippe Coutinho, but now he’s urging them to drop their interest in the Brazilian forward and turn their attention elsewhere. Messi, who apparently turned down a mega offer from Manchester City before extending his contract at the Nou Camp, appears to be in charge of everything at Barca these days – he gets to design next season’s kit – and thinks they need a new centre-back after Samuel Umtiti’s injury. Ajax’s eerily composed 18-year-old, Matthijs de Ligt, is his top pick. For De Ligt, it’s not the worst recommendation.
With Marcos Alonso looking like he needs a good long nap, Chelsea are planning to use some of the money they didn’t spend last summer and buy Alex Sandro for £80m. Alessandro Del Piero thinks that Juventus should spend the cash on Liverpool’s Emre Can.
It isn’t that long since Sporting Lisbon were calling David Sullivan and David Gold “The Dildo Brothers” and “offended virgins” and West Ham were threatening the Portuguese side with legal action. Relations had plummeted to a childish low after the breakdown in talks over the transfer of Sporting’s William Carvalho, much to Slaven Bilic’s chagrin. Good news, though, Slav – the warring parties have kissed and made up, meaning that West Ham could revive their interest in Carvalho next month. Oh. Meanwhile West Ham are also in the hunt for Theo Walcott, as are Everton and Southampton. He’ll probably come out of hiding if they just say a few nice things to him, though.
David de Gea, who scored three goals for Manchester United against Arsenal, wants Real Madrid to make him one of their highest earners. He’s after £10.5m a year. Along with the goalkeeper, Real are also in for a defender. Athletic Bilbao’s Kepa Arrizabalaga fits the bill, while the European championscould sell Dani Ceballos to Arsenal or Tottenham.
United are eyeing Brazilian star Arthur, who’s presumably named after that funny little anthropomorphic aardvark, Lazio’s Sergej-Milinkovic Savic and Tottenham’s Danny Rose, who is theirs for £50m. Watford are poised to beatArsenal to Pontus Dahlberg and buy Gothenburg’s 18-year-old goalkeeper for £3.3m. Sevilla’s Steven N’Zonzi has travelled to London amid whispers of talks with Arsenal and Everton. But he might just be visiting Winter Wonderland.


We may be in the middle of the jumps campaign, with the Express and Star predictably predicting a long, hard freeze and the bookmakers shortening the odds on a white Christmas on a daily basis, but the focus of attention on Wednesday is Flat racing.
It is the action at Lingfield that catches the eye with Toast Of New York, the horse that finished second in a Breeders’ Cup Classic on his latest racecourse appearance, reappearing in the Betway Conditions Stakes. Frankie Dettori will be rocking up to the Surrey venue and clearly if his mount can reproduce anywhere near the level of form he showed when runner-up at Santa Anita three years ago, he should win with ease here.
However, the Jamie Osborne-trained runner is unlikely to be wound up first time out after such a long absence and Intern (1.10) is the one to take him on with.
The selection was highly tried but well beaten in the King Edward VII Stakes at Royal Ascot when last seen, racing far too freely that day. He had previously been beaten just a head in the Sandown Classic Trial and could find the switch to all-weather action to his liking.
Dettori will be arriving early at Lingfield to take the mount on the very well-bred Mordin (11.40) in the opening mile maiden race. The jockey booking is one to note here as is trainer Simon Crisford’s recent record with three-year-old newcomers. Mordin is certainly one to keep a close eye on in the betting.
Summer Icon (12.10) on the same card looks to have been readied with this seven-furlong contest in mind. Mick Channon’s runner was third in the equivalent race last year and can run off a lower rating than when successful over track and trip earlier this year.
The best bet on the two National Hunt cards is at Haydock where Rolling Dylan (1.20) who raced as if the step up to three miles he faces this time when winning at Worcester last month.
Haydock 12.50 Pop Rockstar 1.20 Rolling Dylan (nap) 1.55 Joke Dancer 2.25 Morney Wing 3.00 Ravensdale 3.30 Quids In

Any English dreams were shattered in the blink of an eye. Steve Smith was smiling again. There were no cricketing miracles here despite much feverish, English speculation in the bars of Adelaide late on Tuesday night. Australia won the second Test, which was a grand advert for Test cricket, by 120 runs. On the final day it was a gentle walk in the park for the Australians, the agonies of the fourth day suddenly a distant memory as they bowled England out for 233.
Two Tests up with three to play seldom loses in Ashes cricket. It happened as recently as 1937 but then the Australians, after a poor start, did have Don Bradman, Stan McCabe and Bill O’Reilly. And the tourists promised to pitch the ball up. So did Josh Hazlewood on Wednesday – to good effect.
Hazlewood bustled in from the Cathedral End and within 10 minutes of the start on an old-fashioned Adelaide day – a cloudless sky and the temperature rising – and both overnight batsmen were sent packing without adding to their score. Chris Woakes fell to the second ball he received; he was given out caught behind but reviewed with plenty of encouragement from his captain. Third umpire Marais Erasmus, who has been a busy man throughout this Test, took his time; he engaged with his old pals, HotSpot and Snicko, took note of Snicko, and Woakes – looking slightly bemused – was ultimately on his way.
In Hazlewood’s next over there was no need to summon Erasmus. This time Joe Root was on strike; the ball kept low and took the bottom of his bat yet it still carried to Tim Paine. Once Root saw that it had reached the keeper’s gloves, he set off for the dressing room and must have known then that England’s fate was sealed.
With a left-hander, Moeen Ali, now at the crease, Smith was quick to call upon Nathan Lyon and that straightforward move was soon rewarded. Lyon offered no easy runs so that Moeen eventually opted for the sweep shot, and the ball only made contact with his front pad. Up went Aleem Dar’s finger and yet again Erasmus had to desert his afternoon tea. Two reds and an orange meant that Moeen was out but England had the consolation, an infinitesimal one in the circumstances, of keeping their review under the new regulations.
There has been some debate about whether Moeen or Jonny Bairstow should bat at six in this England set-up. The case for Bairstow moving higher continues to gain weight for obvious tactical reasons triggered by Nathan Lyon. In this series Lyon has taken 10 wickets, nine of them have been left-handers and he has dismissed Moeen in every one of his four innings. So, the logic is that it is better for Bairstow, a right-hander and a good player of off-spin, to try to do a bit of damage to Lyon’s figures before Moeen comes in. Such a change would not be earth-shattering but it might help a little bit – and England need all the help they can get at the moment.
Craig Overton hung around with Bairstow until the advent of the second new ball. Mitchell Starc’s first delivery with the magenta meanderer was perfect, full in length and swinging back into the right-hander. Overton has been around long enough to recognise that he was plumb lbw. So Bairstow, who had looked in good touch, was stranded again, another reason to have him higher up the order.
Starc polished off Stuart Broad with another out-swinger – there is no point in bowling short at anybody with a new ball in your hand – and then Bairstow, seeking to improvise, was the last man to go and Starc’s fifth wicket of the innings.
So England head off to Perth, where they have not won since 1978, 2-0 down. Australia will follow them a few days later in buoyant mood. They have no worries about their bowling attack. All four have been near the top of their games and the excellence of that quartet may disguise the odd concern about one or two of their batsmen. Peter Handscomb might be the most relieved man if Australia opt for an unchanged team in Perth.
England have more concerns. Leaving aside the heavy historical precedents, they lack runs and an effective spinner and they could do with more pace in their attack on surfaces that offer little lateral movement. There are no obvious solutions to these problems. The solitary consolation, which was not always evident four years ago, is that they still seem to be busting a gut out there.


The NRL has outlined its plans to take on the AFLW with a televised national women’s premiership to be launched in 2018.
In a red-letter day for the code and women’s sport in Australia, the NRL announced a raft of initiatives headlined by a new elite women’s competition. “Up to six” NRL teams will be granted franchises with the tender process expected to be finalised by March.
St George Illawarra, Cronulla, South Sydney, Brisbane and the Warriors shape as natural fits for possible licences because of their already strong presence in the women’s game and geography, though NRL CEO Todd Greenberg predicted competition for franchises would be stiff.
With a boom in popularity in women’s sport – such as the AFLW, W-League, Super Netball and WNBL – rugby league is one of the last major sports to announce an elite women’s competition, however, they’re bullish about slicing off a major market share.
NRL CEO Todd Greenberg called it the first step towards a 24-round, fully professional, elite competition to be played alongside the men’s. “It’s the first step. And it is a journey,” Greenberg said.
“We’ve got to be very careful and prudent about how we put these systems in place because rugby league is a tough sport and we want to make sure we have all the care around our players and the physical training that’s needed, the technique that’s needed.
“We’re starting with one step at a time but this is a momentous day for the game.”
The inaugural competition is expected to run from August to September. Matches will be played alongside NRL finals games with the final to be played as a curtain raiser to the men’s grand final at ANZ Stadium on September 30.
The annual Queensland v NSW match – formerly known as the Women’s Interstate Challenge – will be rebranded as State of Origin and will be played on the standalone representative weekend ahead of Origin II in July.
There will be a centralised contracting system with 40 Jillaroos players to receive pay deals on top of their national women’s championship match fees.
There will also be a national combine designed to attract and poach the best talent from other sports including Australian Rules, soccer, cricket, netball and rugby union.
“I dreamt about this,” Jillaroos co-captain Ruan Sims said. “It’s something that we’ve been discussing as more of a tangible opportunity in the last 12 months.
“I honestly thought it would be 2020 by the time we got there. These kinds of opportunities, it excites me so much. I just want to start training, I want to start playing.”


For too long the International Olympic Committee has shown a strange reluctance to prosecute Russian doping. No matter how staggering the evidence, or loud the cries for justice, its president, Thomas Bach, has resisted sanctions. On Tuesday in Lausanne, however, the IOC finally had no choice but to act. The truth had at last overwhelmed its diffidence – and defences.
It came from the former president of Switzerland Samuel Schmid, who confirmed there had been “systemic manipulation” of anti-doping results at the Sochi Winter Olympics in 2014, and elsewhere, by the Russian state – and the evidence was not only extensive but “watertight”. Even Bach, a good friend of the Russia president, Vladimir Putin, felt compelled to call it an “unprecedented attack on the integrity of the Olympic Games and sport”.
By the time Bach, spoke the world knew of Russia’s punishment. Its Olympic Committee had been suspended from the Winter Games in Pyeongchang in February, and its deputy prime minister for sport, Vitaly Mutko, banned from the Olympics for life for his part in the deception. Meanwhile the Russian Olympic Committee was fined $15m (£11.2m) to reimburse the IOC’s costs and to improve the capacity and integrity of the global anti-doping system.
Given the breathtaking extent of their crimes, some will believe the punishments should have been deeper and the fines far steeper. Russia was, in effect, convicted of state-sponsored doping over a thousand athletes in 30 sports after all. Meanwhile Mutko somehow remains in charge of next year’s World Cup, which will be held in Russia.
You might think this would raise an eyebrow at Fifa, especially given dozens of the country’s footballers are under suspicion for being part of the doping programme – especially given that Grigory Rodchenkov, the former head of the Moscow anti-doping laboratory turned whistleblower, gave a 52-page affidavit to Schmid detailing dozens of meetings with Mutko.
Yet less than an hour after the IOC’s decision in Lausanne, Fifa insisted it had “no impact on the preparations for the 2018 World Cup as we continue to work to deliver the best possible event”. Perhaps we should not be surprised. Football’s governing body has never cared much about the grubbier side of the game.
Significantly the verdict was welcomed by anti-doping and athletes groups. Many of them recognised there was no perfect solution but were pleased the IOC had finally took firmer action. As Travis Tygart, the chief executive of the United States Anti-Doping Agency, put it: “Over the past three years, a high-stakes game of chicken has been played between those willing to sacrifice the Olympic ideals by employing a state-directed doping program to cheat to win and, on the other side, athletes unwilling to stand silent while their hopes and dreams were stolen and the Olympic Games hijacked. The IOC listened to those who matter most – and clean athletes won a significant victory.”
Russia was thrown a lifeline, though, with the IOC agreeing its athletes will get to compete in Pyeongchang – albeit under a neutral flag and with the words “Olympic athlete from Russia” on their jerseys, providing they can show they are not tainted by Mutko’s regime. That seems fair enough – this was always about justice not vengeance, and that applies to clean Russian athletes, too.
However it was ironic the solution the IOC came up was nearly identical to that implemented by the International Association of Athletics Federations before the Rio Olympics. Seventeen months ago Bach had sniffed at its proposal. Now he embraced it. Bach explained this reversal by insisting a great deal had changed since the IOC waved through most of Russia’s athletes into the Rio Games. “At the time of Rio we had not the opportunity to follow due process,” he said. “And it was mainly about the failure of the Moscow laboratory – now it is about the manipulation of the Sochi laboratory.”
Such an explanation is clearly disingenuous. By May 2016 the world knew through Rodchenkov’s evidence that agents from Russia’s secret service, the FSB, had found out how to open the supposedly tamper-proof bottles used to collect urine from athletes and had switched samples that would have otherwise tested positive for steroids with clean ones in Sochi. Rodchenkov also claimed that at least 15 medal winners were involved.
The first of two reports by Richard McLaren, published in July 2016, also linked this conspiracy to the heart of the Russian government, saying Mutko as Russia’s sports minister from 2008 to 2016 had issued direct orders to “manipulate particular samples”.
Yes, most countries have a problem with doping but it was obvious long before Tuesday that Russia’s problem was unique in its scale and scope. The IOC was aware of it, too, but chose not to act. Incredibly, Bach said he believed the decision would “draw a line” despite years of state‑sponsored doping in Russia, noting Alexander Zhukov, the president of Russia’s Olympic Committee, had issued an apology, something global regulators have long requested.
But while Bach wants to swiftly move on, for others it will not be so easy. As Rodchenkov’s lawyer, Jim Walden, explained, the whistleblower is still in hiding and facing death threats for speaking out.
“My hope is that the situation improves but the Kremlin has proved to be a very determined and difficult adversary for Grigory,” he said. “He knows that he’s going to be looking over this shoulder for the rest of his life.”


Antonio Conte believes Chelsea remain a side their more fancied Champions League rivals will be anxious to avoid in Monday’s draw for the knockout phase despite surrendering the leadership of Group C to Roma at the last.
Late opportunities flew wide from the substitutes Willian and Michy Batshuayi as the Premier League champions were held 1-1 by Atlético Madrid, with the visitors and their former Chelsea forward, Diego Costa, duly condemned to life in the Europa League in the new year. Chelsea could now be drawn against Paris Saint‑Germain, who beat them in 2015 and 2016, or Barcelona, currently top of La Liga. Sevilla, if they qualify as winners, or Besiktas are more appealing alternatives.
“But when you go through to the next round in this competition, you must be prepared to face the best teams,” Conte said. “So we must be ready. This is the best tournament. That’s why you want to go through and try to be a protagonist in this tournament. At the same time, our opponents won’t be happy to play against us, so we’ll see what happens.
“I remember during the European Championship in 2016 with the national team we finished first in our group and played against Spain, then Germany and, if we’d beaten Germany, we’d have had to play France. Sometimes it’s not so important [to finish first]. We reached the next round and we must be happy with this. After a performance like this, the coach must be [happy].”
While four of the five English teams having qualified – Liverpool can also do so by avoiding defeat to Spartak Moscow at Anfield on Wednesday – there was a word of warning from Conte over the sides’ prospects of thriving in the latter stages of the Champions League.
“It’s true the level of the Premier League is very high,” he said. “To go with five teams into the next round, that means the level of the league is very high and there is a lot of quality in the players. I think there are also really good coaches. It was not ‘simple’ but ‘easy’ for a lot of these teams to go into the next round.
“But, in the future, we have to see. Don’t forget: here the season is very tough. You have to play a lot of games. When you accumulate games, games, games and then you arrive at the final stage, playing in the quarters or the semis, the English teams have a lot of games in their legs. For this reason, it could be problematic to win [the Champions League].
“But, at the same time, the English teams are very good and have the possibility to win and reach the final of the Champions League. I just ask in what physical condition they would arrive in that last stage?”


Jürgen Klopp has said Liverpool must take an “all or nothing” approach to their Champions League showdown with Spartak Moscow and that qualification for the last 16 would signify progress at Anfield.
Liverpool need to avoid defeat at home against the Russian champions on Wednesday to guarantee a place in the knockout stage. Victory would seal first place – even a defeat will suffice for qualification if Sevilla lose at Maribor – and Klopp insists it is unrealistic to expect his prolific side to play for a draw against a Spartak team who must win to advance.
“It is a proper final, all or nothing,” the Liverpool manager said. “We know about the situation. They know the situation. It is Champions League. It is always important but the last game of the group stage is most important if you have to play for something, which we obviously have. It is exciting. All or nothing means you can either win or you lose. We know we can draw but this information is only useful after the game. We cannot play for that and we do not want to.”
Liverpool last reached the knockout phase of the Champions League in 2008-09, when they thrashed Real Madrid 5-0 on aggregate, beating them 1-0 away and 4-0 at home, before losing to Chelsea in the quarter-finals. The club failed to qualify from their groups in 2009-10 and 2014-15 and Klopp says it will be another step in his team’s development to end that sequence against Spartak.
“It would be major progress,” he said. “I am not sure exactly when Liverpool last reached the knockout. Eight years? A long time. You only play the group stage as Liverpool to come through to the last 16. We all know if we do then we have a chance to reach the next round but first we have to make it. It is a tight group. We had some influence on that. We played good games and had good results but not enough points to go through already and now we have to finish the job.”
Klopp confirmed Liverpool’s defensive shortage had eased with Ragnar Klavan and Joe Gomez back in training after missing the 5-1 win over Brighton and Hove Albion on Saturday. Joël Matip remains sidelined with a thigh problem and Adam Lallana is unavailable as he continues to recover from long-term injury.
Klopp has apologised for annoying Chris Hughton but said a breach of managerial protocol, and not his touchline antics, prompted their fallout. Klopp admitted he upset Hughton by hugging Mohamed Salah before shaking the Brighton manager’s hand at the end of the match. “It was a misunderstanding, nothing else,” he said.


Under other circumstances, the main cause for celebration would have been that Manchester United qualified for the Champions League’s knockout stages for the first time since David Moyes was a few months into his six-year contract and Marouane Fellaini was Old Trafford’s newest signing. As it was, in the lowest-profile match of a high-stakes week, sandwiched between games against Arsenal and Manchester City and when progress was all but guaranteed, the most important element could be the goal that might spur Romelu Lukaku into another scoring spree.
“His work for the team every match is crazy,” said José Mourinho, a supportive voice during his £75m signing’s drought. “If I could choose goalscorers, I would always choose the strikers. If he can feel that happiness that strikers only get when they score goals then great.”
Lukaku began his United career with 11 in 10 games. This was just his second in 13 subsequent matches and a first meaningful strike since September. It was beautifully taken and, besides a statistical significance, his equaliser should increase morale and momentum, not least his own. United were trailing, their 39-game unbeaten run at Old Trafford and 100% home record this season under threat, when Lukaku volleyed in Paul Pogba’s delightful ball.
If it was a reminder of how much United will miss their record signing on Sunday, when Pogba begins a three-match suspension for his red card at Arsenal, two goals in as many minutes were both fashioned by superb passes. A swift turnaround was concluded when the influential Juan Mata lofted a ball over the visitors’ defence. Marcus Rashford completed an unusual one-two by angling in the winner to earn the goal he had threatened from the off. He had struck the post in the fourth minute, springing the offside trap to meet Lukaku’s pass, and had used his pace to torment a CSKA Moscow back three with a combined age of 102 and his persistence to keep the goalkeeper Igor Akinfeev busy.
Rashford started, as Mourinho made six changes with City in mind. Even with seven players injured or rested it was notable that Henrikh Mkhitaryan was omitted altogether for the fifth time in six games. Luke Shaw, another who has felt Mourinho’s displeasure when marginalised, began for the first time in 219 days, almost scored his first career goal with a volley Akinfeev parried and drew rare praise from his manager.
“It was a very positive performance, especially going forwards,” he added. “He was deserving of that opportunity for quite a long time and he is going to get more.” In the short term, however, demotion beckons as others return. Mourinho ruled Eric Bailly and Michael Carrick out of the derby, while adding: “Phil Jones has a chance, Fellaini a chance, Zlatan [Ibrahimovic] a big chance and [Nemanja] Matic is injured but will play for sure.”
Their absences meant progress was a squad achievement. “Fifteen points in a season returning to the Champions League is good,” said Mourinho. It would have taken a seven-goal defeat, which United have not suffered since 1931, plus a victory for Basel over Benfica to eliminate them. That always appeared improbable but a first home defeat since City’s last visit to Old Trafford was on the cards when CSKA led in bizarre fashion.
Vitinho’s shot went in via Alan Dzagoev’s back as United appealed for offside. Referee Gianluca Rocchi rightly ruled that Daley Blind, who had slid off the pitch in an attempt to cut out Mário Fernandes’ cross, had played Dzagoev onside. Uefa muddied the waters by crediting Vitinho with the goal but Mourinho conceded it was correctly given.
Thereafter, Sergio Romero was required to make a late save to deny Dzagoev an altogether more conventional equaliser, while Mourinho was left pondering if United’s reward for topping Group A will be a meeting with Real Madrid or Bayern Munich. “I am not the luckiest guy with draws,” he said sardonically. “It is better I shut up and forget it.”


Bayern Munich ended Paris Saint-Germain’s 100% record in Group B but their 3-1 victory at the Allianz Arena was not enough to prevent the French club from finishing top.
With both teams already qualified for the knockout stages, two goals from Corentin Tolisso and another from Robert Lewandowski gave Bayern hope of pulling off the improbable win by a four-goal margin that would have resulted in them ousting PSG.
Yet the visitors, who had beaten Bayern 3-0 in Paris, always looked likely to avoid that once Kylian Mbappé scored just after half-time.
The German champions had started brightly, Lewandowski having time to turn and score in the eighth minute after being played onside by Dani Alves, before Tolisso headed home James Rodríguez’s cross in the 37th minute. With the home crowd sensing an extraordinary story, Mbappé ruined the script when heading in from Edinson Cavani’s neat chipped cross five minutes after the break.
Still, the French midfielder Tolisso kept the pressure on, finishing clinically in the 69th minute after David Alaba’s storming run and cross down the left flank.
While PSG and Bayern ended on 15 points each, Celtic took third place, guaranteeing Europa League football, despite losing 1-0 at home to Anderlecht.
Barcelona rounded off their qualifying campaign in group D by beating Sporting Lisbon 2-0 at the Camp Nou, with both goals coming in the second half.
With Lionel Messi left on the bench, Paco Alcacer gave Barcelona the lead in the 59th minute with a glancing header from a corner and the second goal came when their former defender Jeremy Mathieu slid Aleix Vidal’s low cross into his own net in stoppage time.
Barcelona had already secured their place in the last 16 as Group D winners before the game, while Sporting needed to win and for Juventus not to beat Olympiakos in order to reach the knockout stages for the first time in nine seasons.
Their hopes were quickly dashed when Juan Cuadrado put Juventus ahead in the 15th minute in Athens and Federico Bernardeschi made it 2-0 in the 90th, which meant Sporting dropped into the Europa League whatever happened at the Nou Camp.
While Chelea were being held at home by Atlético Madrid, Roma took top spot in Group C after defeating Qarabag 1-0 at the Stadio Olimpico.
Diego Perotti’s header in the 53rd minute settled a tight encounter. The move was started and finished by Perotti, who drove forward and exchanged a couple of neat passes before the ball found its way to Edin Dzeko, whose shot was parried by the keeper into the path of the Argentinian, who headed in from close range.
Basel clinched second place in Group A with a 2-0 victory over Benfica in Lisbon, while Manchester United finished top after their 2-1 home win over CSKA Moscow. The Swiss club made an excellent start against the Portuguese champions when Mohamed Elyounoussi headed them into a fifth-minute lead from Michael Lang’s cross. They doubled their advantage 20 minutes into the second half when Dimitri Oberlin headed home from close range, condemning Benfica to a sixth successive defeat.


Tim Cahill’s participation in next year’s World Cup finals is uncertain after the Socceroos striker and his A-League club, Melbourne City, announced they have mutually agreed to part ways.
Cahill, Australia’s all-time leading goalscorer, leaves the club on his 38th birthday, in the middle of the domestic season and with just six months to go before the tournament in Russia kicks off.
Cahill has scored 50 goals in 104 national appearances, and said his focus will now be on retaining his place in the Socceroos squad and playing at a fourth World Cup. Presumably, that means finding a club as soon as possible.
Yet his next move remains unknown, with Adelaide United’s general manager of football Ante Kovacevic saying he would discuss with coach Marco Kurz the possibility of luring Cahill to South Australia. However, it is more likely he will head overseas, most probably to the Middle East, to find the match minutes he craves.
Cahill, who has been used sparingly by City coach Warren Joyce this season and started just one match, indicated after he helped Australia to World Cup qualification in their intercontinental playoff win over Honduras last month that he needed regular playing time if he was to make the plane to Russia.
“Qualifying for the World Cup has been a great adventure, and it would be a massive honour to represent my country in Russia,” he said. “That will be my focus in the coming months.”
What happens to Cahill during that period is sure to be of interest to whoever takes on the Socceroos’ coaching position. Football Federation Australia said on Tuesday it had appointed a panel to decide who will succeed Ange Postecoglou by February.
There remains a certain reliance on Cahill for goals at international level, and it was the veteran’s brace against Syria in the Asian qualifying playoff that kept alive the Socceroos’ hopes of reaching Russia.
The former Everton player, who started his senior career at Millwall and later had spells in the US with New York Red Bulls and in China with Shanghai Shenhua and Hangzhou Greentown, joined City on a three-year contract at the start of the 2016-17 season.
Having scored in his first game back in Australia – an FFA Cup tie – his A-League career then started with a bang as he scored one of the goals of the season – a spectacular long-range effort in the Melbourne derby on his league debut. He went on to add a further 12 goals to his tally, none this season, before his shock departure.
He helped City win the club’s first piece on silverware – the FFA Cup in 2016 – but his time back in his country of birth was also marked by injury and, at times, controversy. He was sent off before entering the field of play in another Melbourne derby in February this year and one of his goal celebrations against Syria in October raised eyebrows.
Speculation over Cahill’s club career has been rife recently with Joyce forced last month to dismiss suggestions of a rift between the pair as “just tittle-tattle”.
Cahill said having the opportunity to play in Australia had always been an important career goal and that the experience “has been fulfilling from start to finish”.
“The welcome from fans, the quality of the facilities and the ever-increasing quality of football continues to be a source of immense pride,” Cahill said.
He leaves with City sitting in third place on the A-League ladder, six points off pacesetting Sydney FC.
Joyce said he was grateful to have had the opportunity to work with Cahill over the past 15 months. “Having players of Tim’s stature in the dressing room can only help develop a squad’s ambitions, and his impact on the team and for the club is well known, particularly with the younger players in the squad,” he said.
“In the period that I’ve worked with Tim, I have appreciated the contribution he has made both on and off the field and the dedication he has shown in training. We all wish him the very best on the next stage of his career.”


Sam Allardyce may miss Everton’s Europa League match at Apollon Limassol to prepare for Sunday’s Merseyside derby at Anfield.
Allardyce has confirmed he will field a makeshift team on Thursday in order to make the Premier League trip to Liverpool the priority. Apollon and Everton, who have recorded the worst performance in the competition by an English team in history, cannot qualify from the group and the visitors are set to field several youngsters in Cyprus.
It has emerged Everton may also have a below strength technical area, with Allardyce set to work with the first-team squad at the Finch Farm training ground. The newly appointed coach Craig Shakespeare will take charge of the Europa League fixture.
Allardyce had only two full days to prepare for his first win as Everton manager – the 2-0 league defeat of Huddersfield Town on Saturday – and wants to spend more time with the senior squad before the visit to Anfield.


Jürgen Klopp summed up Liverpool’s sense of missed opportunity at the Otkritie Arena in September. “Moscow had injury problems for sure and Quincy Promes will be back for them at Anfield,” he said ruefully after a 1-1 draw. The Russian champions may pose a greater threat in Wednesday’s return but will know the same is undoubtedly true of Liverpool.
A point at Spartak Moscow’s raucous home – where Sevilla fell to a 5-1 defeat the following month – was not a bad return for Liverpool. It was, however, a poor reflection of their dominance over Massimo Carrera’s side and in keeping with the early-season pattern of wasted chances and punished mistakes.
Liverpool had 17 shots on goal to the home side’s three that night and converted only one, through Philippe Coutinho, with Spartak’s substitute goalkeeper, Aleksandr Selikhov, inspired in the closing stages.
The pattern has now been broken, as Brighton & Hove Albion were the latest opponents to discover on Saturday, and only Paris Saint-Germain had scored more than Liverpool’s 16 goals in the Champions League group stage going into the final set of matches. Unless Spartak become the first away team to win at Anfield this season, it will be Spartak who have cause to rue a lost opportunity.
“They have three very important offensive players back in Promes, Zé Luís and Denis Glushakov,” said Klopp, returning to the theme of his post-match analysis in Moscow. “Glushakov is an experienced runner from midfield, always running in behind. Promes is like Sadio Mané. He can shoot very quick and is a proper striker. That makes it different of course. But we are different. We are in another moment. We need to have confidence and use our stadium.
“I don’t know if I can order it but if I could order it then this would be a good moment for Anfield to be at its best. That is what I am looking for. It is special. We played there and drew and we were the better side, we had more chances, and now they bring back three important players. That is a fantastic side in a good moment. If someone has decided we are already through then Moscow may think of their impressive win versus Sevilla. I see this as an opportunity.”
Mané, an unused substitute at Brighton, claims Liverpool are capable of “beating any team in the world” and will be a side to avoid should they reach the last 16 for the first time since 2008-09. After the experience of conceding three second-half goals in Sevilla, however, and squandering the chance to win the group with a game to spare, he admits there can be no loss of focus against Spartak.
“This is one of the biggest games in the season for us,” the Liverpool forward said. “It is the dream of every player in the world to play in the Champions League and very important for us. The fans deserve it, the club also. Liverpool is a big and great club and we want to play a big part in the Champions League. We want to go as far as we can. We going to try to do our best and cause as many problems as we can for the defenders.”
For Klopp, there is no point disguising the magnitude of a match he describes as a “final” and an “all or nothing” occasion. His team have got this far by delivering in similar circumstances against Hoffenheim in the play-off and Middlesbrough on the final day of last season, after all.
“There is pressure and we cannot ignore it, we are going for something big,” the Liverpool manager said. “We had it against Middlesbrough and Hoffenheim and we did it quite well so far and have to do it again. But Spartak are a good side. I cannot ignore that. They have their own targets. They rested three or four players in the last game and still won. They have one more game and then a three-month break. They have their targets and we have ours.”
Liverpool know victory would secure a place in the knockout stage as group winners and a draw will also suffice for qualification, although Klopp is adamant his team cannot and will not play for a point. The equation is more straightforward for Spartak: win at Anfield or enter the Europa League. Carrera’s team may be more committed to attack as a consequence and leave more space at the back for Liverpool to exploit but Klopp suspects they will not adopt that approach from the first whistle.
He said: “If I knew 100% how they will start the game I will say yes, it does suit us. They must attack and it can cause us problems if we do not defend well. We can have counterattacks and everyone is saying we are brilliant at counterattacks. We scored some nice goals, that is true, but we have to do our job.
“We are a possession team. We will have the ball and must have an idea for that and perfect protection as the game develops. Do we go 1-0 up and they go like crazy, or 1-0 down and then what does that mean? We need to be ready for a 95-minute game and fight.”


Pep Guardiola has denied Manchester City offered Lionel Messi a €100m signing-on fee to leave Barcelona last summer. Messi agreed fresh terms last week to extend his stay until 2021. A report in Spain on Tuesday claimed City tried to lure the 30-year-old with the €100m fee plus a €50m a-year salary.
Guardiola, asked about the reputed offer, said: “Lionel Messi has signed a contract one week ago. This was never going to happen; Messi started his career there and he’s going to finish it there. If he wanted to leave he wouldn’t have signed the contract.”
Pressed that the report claimed the offer came before Messi agreed new terms, City’s manager said: “It’s not true.”
City play Shakhtar Donetsk in Kharkiv on Wednesday night in the final Group F game already through as winners. If they win Guardiola will be the club’s first manager to win all six group games.
Yaya Touré, who won the Champions League with Barcelona under Guardiola in 2009, believes City are playing the best football in the competition. “We think we practise the best football in Europe when we go forward, though we find it difficult against some opponents,” Touré said. “We need to play against a big opponent to see where we are. To repeat what I did in 2009 with a different club, in a different club, would be something special.
“Teams respect us more now. They feel the way we play and attack. We are in a good moment, full of confidence. If you ask all my team-mates they are all enjoying it.”
Guardiola, though, was less emphatic. “We are doing well but that doesn’t mean you will achieve the title,” he said. “In this competition one bad 45 minutes and you are out. That means you can win the title but go out if you are doing well. I’m not concerned if we are playing the best football.”
Guardiola said David Silva may miss Sunday’s derby at Manchester United. “David had a little bit of a problem in the last minutes [against West Ham United on Sunday],” he said. “We made a test after the game and I don’t know if he is able to play on Sunday so that’s why he stayed there, to recover in Manchester.”
Asked what the problem was, Guardiola laughed off the question. He confirmed Bernardo Silva would start and said City, winners of their past 20 games, would go for victory against Ukraine’s champions, who are second in the group.
“We play for our prestige and to keep our winning mentality,” he said. “We are so happy to be in the last 16 but it will be tough. I saw them play Napoli, their midfield is good, their buildup is perfect. It is a tough game, a tough team.”


The Rugby Football Union is open to the possibility of getting rid of promotion and relegation to and from the Premiership, according to its chief executive, Steve Brown.
The RFU has traditionally been against ring-fencing the top flight but Brown conceded that as discussions continue over how the domestic structure fits in with the global calendar from 2020 onwards, its stance has changed somewhat.
As revealed by the Guardian last week, reducing the Premiership to 10 teams is also among a host of suggestions previously made and Brown admitted it may take until the end of the season to reach a resolution, more than a year after Premiership Rugby Limited announced its intention to extend its season to 10 months, adding, “There’s no specific plan of action at this point”. Brown also hinted that doing away with one or both of the A League and the Anglo-Welsh Cup may also be part of the solution.
“We’re looking at all options, but there’s no specific consideration of numbers [of teams in each league] at the moment, whether it’s the first or second level, at this stage,” he said. “It’s not just about number of teams in the league, it’s also about the number of competitions played within the season.
“Our historic view would be the same, that promotion and relegation is the right thing. But going forward, the world is changing rapidly, the dynamics are changing [and] we’re trying to fit the season together. If it has to change, for the benefit of the game overall, why would we close our mind to it?”


In the end, this was a result to be savoured only in Rome. Chelsea, held at home, had allowed leadership of the group to slip through their fingers at the last and, if the implications of finishing runners-up will only become clear after Monday’s draw, the potential of a collision with Paris Saint-Germain or Barcelona in the knockout stage looms large. Yet for Atlético Madrid, the significance of another fruitless slog is far more serious.
The Europa League awaits Diego Simeone and his side, those heady memories of being finalists on the grander stage in 2014 and 2016 fading for all that their vociferous travelling support was still bellowing their defiance into the night sky long after the final whistle. This team may not have lost in any competition since Chelsea triumphed in stoppage time at the Estadio Metropolitano in September, but their campaign has been littered with wasteful draws. In truth, this was not one of them. Their lead on the night had always felt flimsy and they might well have been beaten, such were the opportunities passed up by Chelsea in the latter stages in particular.
Simeone turned swiftly on his heels at the end, disappearing down the tunnel in his frustration, while Chelsea players, just as exasperated, pondered quite how they had failed to secure the victory which would have secured Group C and rendered Roma’s victory over Qarabag irrelevant. “We more than deserved the win, and had some fantastic chances, particularly in that second half,” said Gary Cahill. “How have we not won it? We should have won...” The defender had been flanked by Eden Hazard, the game’s outstanding performer, in the tunnel as he voiced that disbelief to the television cameras. The Belgian at his side merely shrugged and, with a hint of a wink, reminded his captain: “We are a top side, we are Chelsea, we can still do everything.”
That belief will remain regardless of who awaits in the new year. It had been Hazard who had choked Atlético’s brief surge of belief here, collecting Cesc Fàbregas’ deep cross on the left corner of the penalty area 15 minutes from time before fizzing a low shot across goal which Stefan Savic inadvertently deflected beyond the excellent Jan Oblak. The visitors would have been aware by then that Roma, second at the start of play, were leading at the Stadio Olimpico courtesy of Diego Perotti’s goal, nullifying their advantage and effectively eliminating them from the competition. They remain a team undone by those inexplicable failures to beat Qarabag home or away.
With the puff having been knocked out of the visitors, the procession of chances in the frantic finale all fell to the Premier League team. Oblak, a goalkeeper “on fire” according to Hazard, had thwarted Álvaro Morata in front of goal as the striker prepared to convert Fàbregas’ square pass, then watched the substitute, Willian, undone by an untimely bobble to slice horribly high and wide as the goal gaped. When Chelsea had been trailing, it had taken Oblak and José Maria Giménez to thwart Morata’s attempt to stab a loose ball into the net from virtually on the goal-line. The approach play from Victor Moses and clever flick from Pedro in the build-up deserved better.
Davide Zappacosta, an uncomfortable makeshift left wing-back, and Morata had drawn splendid saves form the Slovenian international during a one-sided first half, while Hazard, tormenting Savic and Lucas Hernández, was a constant menace, maintaining the form which has illuminated the Premier League of late. All-comers will fear his impact in the knockout stages when the prospect of playing Chelsea, as Antonio Conte made clear, will hardly fill any of their prospective opponents with optimism, even if PSG have eliminated the London club in their last two ventures in the competition and Barcelona top La Liga. Either Sevilla, if they win their group, or Besiktas might be more appealing but, in reality, any tie should be cherished. The alternative, as Simeone, Atlético and Diego Costa would testify, can feel rather deflating.
The visitors had only really prospered in one brief period amid incessant Chelsea pressure just before the hour-mark. Filipe Luís suddenly planted a left-footed shot on to the post from distance, with Thibaut Courtois doing well to spring up, dive and claim Koke’s diving header from the rebound. Then a corner by Koke was flicked on by Fernando Torres, on his first return to the club with whom he had claimed a European Cup, with the ball looping to Saúl Ñíguez, escaping Tiemoué Bakayoko’s attentions at the far post, to nod unchallenged into the net. Conte was pained by the ease his team had been infiltrated.
Yet, once the hosts had rallied, the real pain was Atlético’s. “It hurts, and we’ve actually managed to get more points from the team who finished top of the group than the one who finished bottom,” added Simeone. “But no excuses. This is not a failure. It’s just a new challenge.” That was hugely positive spin. The test lying ahead for Chelsea is more mouth-watering.


Brendan Rodgers was keen to accentuate positives after Celtic’s latest European disappointment. Perhaps he was quite right to; from a Champions League section that also included Bayern Munich and Paris St-Germain, Europa League football after Christmas was always the fairest target.
Celtic confirmed third place in unimpressive fashion, though, and with only three points. Victory in the head-to-head scenario with Anderlecht was necessary to extend Celtic’s European stay, after the Belgians secured success in Glasgow which should really have been by more than one goal. Celtic were second best in every department with their manager, curiously, citing the “context of the game” as problematic. It was Celtic who entered this tie with the glaring advantage, after all, having swaggered to a 3-0 success in Belgium.
Rodgers is rightly lauded in these parts for a domestic record of being unbeaten in 67 games. Yet it would be remiss of onlookers not to pinpoint failings visible throughout this European campaign. Celtic must improve if they seek to enjoy a Europa League run worthy of the name.
“They were better than us tonight,” Rodgers admitted. “But over the bigger picture, our aim at the beginning of the competition was to get through to the Europa League. We have done that. There is immense pride but it’s hard to feel that when you’ve lost. There is a story for some of our players in that they have a long way to go before they can call themselves be players at this level. But we’ve shown over the course of this campaign that we can be better.”
Any sense of Celtic complacency was undermined by their starting lineup. Rodgers named his strongest available team, with Moussa Dembélé returning from injury to spearhead the home attack. In one way, Celtic had a point to prove; 10 matches had passed in group stages of either the Champions or Europa League without them winning at home. Such a statistic contradicts the widely held notion of this being a venue to intimidate continental opposition. The winless figure increased before 10pm.
Anderlecht had shown marked improvement since the reverse to Celtic in Brussels and yet, like the Scottish champions, they had found Group B a struggle; Anderlecht arrived in Glasgow having scored just a single group goal.
That should have been doubled during the opening exchanges in which Anderlecht were by far the more composed team. Henry Onyekuru cut the ball back for Sven Kums, with Craig Gordon forced into a smart save with his legs. With Celtic struggling to impose themselves, Adrien Trebel was the next to test Gordon courtesy of an acrobatic effort.
If there was concern for Anderlecht during the first half, it resonated in the failure to turn dominance into meaningful reward. The probings of the visiting captain, Sofiane Hanni, caused all manner of problems for the Celtic defence with Rodgers’s team woefully unable to retain possession when in the Anderlecht half.
Rodgers replaced two ineffectual players, Stuart Armstrong and Scott Sinclair, at the break. The Belgians again opened on the front foot, though, with the outstanding Hanni narrowly failing to connect with a Pieter Gerkens cross just six yards from goal.
With Celtic showing improvement, James Forrest sought to rub salt into Belgian wounds with a curling effort which Frank Boeckx scrambled wide of a post. Fortune was soon to favour Anderlecht at the other end. Sloppy Celtic defending allowed Dennis Appiah possession on the right, with the defender’s cross seemingly straightforward for Jozo Simunovic to clear. Instead, the centre-back miscued a header beyond Gordon.
Simunovic could have atoned for his blunder with a 67th-minute half-volley which instead flew over Boeckx’s crossbar. Dembélé squandered another chance, 18 minutes from time, after Kieran Tierney had fed him at the end of a typically marauding left wing run. This was to be Dembélé’s last act as he limped off to be replaced by the PSG loanee Odsonne Édouard.
Hanni almost intensified a slightly edgy Celtic Park scenario with a 20-yard drive which had Gordon worried. Thankfully for Celtic, this proved the extent of their fright.


The Arsenal Invincibles’ unbeaten season will probably never be replicated. Arsène Wenger’s 2003-04 side sealed their place in history when Patrick Vieira scored against Leicester City to ensure the achievement was completed with a win. So it is perhaps apt that Arsenal have looked to another manager who has presided over an invincible season to turn around the fortunes of their women’s side.
Pedro Martínez Losa’s abrupt departure one month into a stuttering new campaign despite strong recruitment came after a disappointing tenure. In Losa’s three years he won the 2015 Continental Cup (League Cup) and the FA Cup final against Chelsea in 2016 but failed to keep the club in contention in the league.
Now Joe Montemurro is charged with bridging the growing gap between historically dominant Arsenal, who have 43 major trophies in their 30-year history, and the new money of Manchester City and Chelsea.
After a week in London grappling with the logistics of his round-the-world move and getting as acquainted as possible with a squad split up for an international break, the Australian sits in London Colney still very much surprised to be there. “Ah look, it’s still a little bit surreal,” he says with a wide grin. “Was there any hesitation? Well, no. When a global brand like Arsenal calls you and shows interest obviously it’s an amazing honour. You think about what a fantastic project it could be. To be involved with such an amazing brand and identity in world football is fantastic.”
Montemurro may seem surprised by his recruitment for one of the most attractive managerial positions in women’s football but he comes with an impressive record.
Having been picked by City Football Group to lead the new Melbourne City team (added to the CFG portfolio after Manchester City and New York City) in the W-League (Australia’s women’s top division), Montemurro won the title without dropping a point.
“It was an amazing project because I had the opportunity to build a team from scratch, so you’re able to stamp your beliefs and your ideas on it, and create a template for high standards,” Montemurro says. “And we recruited on the basis of that.
“One aspect of it was to create the first real professional organisation, professional women’s team in Australia, and the City Group were fantastic because they backed wanting that and creating that identity from day one. Hopefully I’ve left a footprint and a template for it to continue.”
The following season things were a little tougher as he attempted to balance his managerial duties with an assistant coach position with the men’s team. “The reality was that I got pretty much told that the men’s team wanted me as an assistant coach and we tried the process of juggling both, being an assistant coach and also a head coach of two high-performance teams. It was difficult, because obviously Australia is a big country and there’d be times when I would be sitting on the bench in Sydney on a Friday night and then I’d have to catch a flight over to Perth for a Sunday morning game.”
Midway through the W-League season he handed over the managerial reins to his assistant, the Wales international Jess Fishlock, who took the role of player-coach and guided the side to a second league title.
Montemurro became the chief assistant coach of the men’s side at the start of 2017 but after a string of poor performances and a coaching staff reshuffle he switched back to women’s football when Arsenal came calling. “To be honest, for me it’s just football. I don’t differentiate whether it’s male or female, I just love coaching football. An opportunity at a level where I feel we can all grow and be better is what’s important.”
Montemurro’s style and managerial philosophy fit Arsenal’s brand of football: “When I originally presented my CV and presented my vision, my model and my way of training, it did fall in line with the club’s. I believe in an attractive brand of football, possession-based football, winning games in the right way. The other thing is there seems to be a synergy between my character and where the club is at the moment. All the stars aligned.”
Life at Arsenal may seem a world away from the W-League but not everyone at the club is a stranger to the new manager. Kim Little scored nine goals in the unbeaten Melbourne City 2015-16 season, on loan from Seattle Reign, and the Scotland striker has been vocal about her approval of Montemurro’s appointment since the announcement on 7 November. Montemurro is equally excited to be reunited with such a talented player. “I’ve got to pay her for all that publicity,” he says, laughing. “We kept in contact via email, I knew she was injured for the Euros, so I just sent her an email saying: ‘How’s the rehab?’ So there was no real communication before the job, but obviously as the job moved closer we started to talk.
“You have moments in your career where you get to work with players of that stature and I can’t think of a more consummate professional than Kim Little both as a player and as a person. It was an absolute honour to have worked with her in that situation and hopefully we can look forward to some bigger and better things together.”
The other players he has had the chance to meet so far have also been welcoming, and the facilities have impressed. “The players don’t want for anything, they’ve got everything here, it’s absolutely world-class. From an individual player perspective, so far everyone has been amazing and welcoming. It’s always nice at the start, everyone wants to know you and get to know you.”
If he feels under pressure to deliver in the manner he did for Melbourne City, he does not show it. “I probably put myself under more pressure than the club’s putting me under,” he says. But he recognises how important it is to return the club to the top: “Winning trophies is part of Arsenal’s DNA, and doing it the right way is. “There’s no doubt about the fact that we’ve got to win trophies. We’ve got to stabilise the team’s direction. Making it believe in its identity and believe in what Arsenal means. In end if we have thoArsenal worldwide has an identity. If you took the red strip off and put a purple strip on you’d know it’s Arsenal by the way they play because they retain the ball, they’re proactive, they are an innovative brand.
se base values then they’ll enjoy their football and win games.”
Stability is Montemurro’s focus. When Arsenal’s leaky defence is mentioned (they have conceded more goals than the two teams in front of them, Chelsea and City, and the two behind, Liverpool and Reading) the man who saw his Melbourne City side score 42 and concede five in a season, is matter of fact about the task ahead. “There’s been a lot of chopping and changing thanks to injuries and so on,” he says. “The first thing to do is stabilise that area and let it find a little bit of belief in that stability and then we’ll go from there. The talent is there, the quality is there so we will work towards that.”
Montemurro’s arrival at Arsenal is just the latest development in an exciting year for Australian women’s football. The national team have lost only once in 2017, won the inaugural friendly Tournament of Nations and have broken attendance records at home games. Sam Kerr was named NWSL MVP for her prolific goalscoring for Sky Blue FC, breaking the American league’s single-season scoring record in the process.
“There’s a definite belief in women’s sport in general in Australia,” says Montemurro. “I think everyone – governments, national federations, national associations in all sports – really backs the ability for women’s sport to go forward, that’s a general undertow to the sporting landscape in Australia.” And they are benefiting from putting their faith in their younger players: “There’s no doubt that the national team is going through a golden generation of players and the reality is that it started very, very young. Players like Alanna Kennedy, Steph Catley have already played 50 to 60 games for the national team, they’re only 23/24 years old. They’re young. There’s a generation that have come through, they are young and the most important thing is that they are amazing role models for women’s sport. That’s definitely starting to filter down into the under-age groups, into the W-League and also seeing more players going overseas. The landscape at the moment is just very, very healthy.”
Montemurro takes to the touchline for his first Arsenal league match on Sunday, against Liverpool. “As I said it’s surreal, it’s Arsenal v Liverpool, and I’m on the bench for it. It’s a little bit crazy. But ultimately I’m just really looking forward to it and really looking forward to growing and developing and putting Arsenal back where it should be.”
Chelsea booked their place in the Continental Cup quarter-finals with a thumping 8-0 win over Yeovil at Kingsmeadow. Crystal Dunn opened the scoring before an own goal, Erin Cuthbert and Drew Spence gave the Blues a 4-0 half-time cushion. There was no let-up for Yeovil, Cuthbert adding her second before Fran Kirby, Gemma Davison and Spence compounded the Somerset side’s misery. Eni Aluko was taken off on a stretcher in the second half after colliding with the advertising hoardings but was given the all-clear after a hospital check-up. Manchester City’s 2-0 win over Birmingham secured their, and Everton’s, passage into the quarter-finals in Group Two North.
Bristol City’s 3-0 win against Brighton means they leapfrog the south-coast side into second in Group Two South, behind Chelsea. Reading’s five-goal win at Millwall secured top spot of Group One South ahead of Arsenal, and elsewhere it ended Oxford United 1-5 Doncaster Belles, London Bees 1-1 Watford (London Bees won 5-4 on penalties), Aston Villa 3-2 Durham.
Manchester City’s manager, Nick Cushing, has withdrawn from the running for the Lionesses manager’s job and signed a new contract until the end of the 2020-21 season. One of the favourites for the national team vacancy, Cushing guided City to the title and Continental Cup in 2016 before picking up the FA Cup in 2017. City are unbeaten at the top of WSL 1.
Following the folding of FC Kansas City, the NWSL announced Real Salt Lake had acquired an NWSL franchise which would receive the player contracts and draft picks of the defunct club. The new side are to be managed by the former Arsenal and Seattle Reign coach Laura Harvey and have been named Utah Royals FC.
The England defender Lucy Bronze was on the scoresheet as Lyon put five past Marseille, who sit at the bottom of Ligue 1 Feminine. Lyon’s win keeps them two points clear of Paris St-Germain, who beat Bordeaux 3-0 on Saturday. Third-placed Montpellier stayed in touching distance of the top two and eight points clear of Paris FC with a 5-1 win at Soyaux.
Euro 2017 golden boot winner Jodie Taylor topped off the year by winning the BT Sport Action Woman of the Year award in a public vote. The England women’s cricket team won the first award of the night, Team of the Year, at the fifth annual awards. Judy Murray was given a lifetime achievement award.


The Lambourn-based trainer Jamie Osborne believes Toast Of New York is more than ready for his first competitive appearance in more than three years when he runs at Lingfield on Wednesday.
The six-year-old, who won the 2014 UAE Derby at Meydan and finished a close second to Bayern in the Breeders’ Cup Classic at Santa Anita that November, was snapped up by Al Shaqab Racing before a tendon injury forced his premature retirement.
However, following a largely unsuccessful spell at stud, a racecourse return was rumoured and it comes to fruition in Lingfield’s Betway Conditions Stakes with Toast Of New York, who will be ridden by Frankie Dettori, one of five runners.
“We kept it quiet for a long time as when we started the process we really didn’t know how far we’d get,” Osborne said. “We’ve taken things very slowly but he’s had no soundness issues whatsoever and now it’s time to find out where we stand. We won’t know all the answers until he runs but the signs he’s been showing us in the last month have been very good.”
Osborne’s optimism about Toast Of New York’s return was boosted by a couple of recent racecourse gallops. “We took him to Kempton to work with Battalion about a month ago and that went well. We then took him to Lingfield to work with a 98-rated miler called Qassem who we got from Hugo Palmer and that went very well,” he said.
“Jimmy McCarthy, who rode the horse every day has a two-year-old and three-year-old, has ridden him virtually every day this year and he strongly feels he retains his ability.”
Toast Of New York will be fitted with a hood because, Osborne said, “We felt towards the end of his three-year-old season he was starting to behave badly pre-race. He did it Santa Anita before he ran in the Breeders’ Cup Classic and he was kind of the same when we took him to Kempton. He just gets himself in a bit of a tizz. We tried him in the hood at Lingfield and he did seem to behave much better. There’s not a lot of downside to it so we thought it was worth a go.”
Outlining his plans for the horse should all go well, Osborne added: “We’ll cross each hurdle as we come to it, but the dream scenario would be to go for the Pegasus World Cup [Gulfstream Park, 27 January]. Obviously that would be a huge ask, but as far as we’re concerned the dream is still alive at the moment. If that doesn’t work out we might give him a mini campaign over here and then aim for the Dubai World Cup, or we might have to lower his sights.
“I did shed a little tear when he left us. I thought I might never see him again. To have him back means a lot to the family and the yard and we’re really looking forward to seeing him run.”

Dele Alli has described himself as his own worst critic and suggested he is conscious of his lack of consistency this season. The Tottenham Hotspur midfielder has hit the heights, notably with his two-goal performance in the 3-1 Champions League win over Real Madrid at Wembley last month, but there have been other occasions when he has laboured.
The 21-year-old intends to use Wednesday night’s final Champions League Group H game against Apoel Nicosia to generate a bit of momentum. It is the theme for Tottenham, as well. Since the victory over Madrid, they have won only one of their five Premier League matches – and that was the streaky 1-0 victory against Crystal Palace. The period has included the 2-1 Champions League success at Borussia Dortmund, though.
Tottenham are certain to finish top of the group and, in that context, it felt slightly surprising to hear Mauricio Pochettino say Alli would start against Apoel. The manager will rest other leading players, including Hugo Lloris, Eric Dier, Christian Eriksen and Harry Kane but Alli will play because, according to Pochettino, he is fresh, having sat out the first three Champions League games through suspension.
“I’m happy to be getting another Champions League tie because growing up as a kid you want to be playing in the Champions League, so to have to miss the first three games was horrible for me,” said Alli, who served the ban as a result of being sent off when Spurs were eliminated from the Europa League in February. “I can’t thank the manager enough for putting me back into the team for the first game that I was back [against Madrid at Wembley]. I was happy to repay him with the two goals. Every game is an opportunity to learn and we’re looking forward to Apoel.”
Alli mentioned his learning curve on several occasions but, as significant in the discussion about his form, he brought up how important it was that he continued to have fun on the pitch. Alli thrives when the shackles are off, when he can give free reign to his expression.
“I have learned a lot so far this season and in the two years previously,” Alli said. “I would like to be at my highest level in every single game and every training session but I don’t think that’s possible. I think it’s been a good opportunity for me to learn more about myself as a player and as a person, so I’m looking forward and I’ve got to keep enjoying it.
“Am I self-critical? Very. I am my own biggest critic. I know every time when I’m not playing well and if it’s not going well for me. It’s important that we never set our standards and say we’ve reached our standards. We’ve got to keep improving and getting better every season and in every training session.”
Pochettino has named two academy youngsters in his squad – the midfielder Luke Amos and the striker Kazaiah Sterling – and he is ready to give a first Champions League start to George-Kévin Nkoudou, the winger who has struggled since his transfer from Marseille in the summer of last year.
“I think Nkoudou has started to realise he needs to improve in many things,” Pochettino said. “I wanted to give him the opportunity before but it was impossible. Maybe against Apoel he will have the possibility to play and prove he can help the team and start to grow up.
“There is nothing to complain about his behaviour – he is a lovely kid – but, in professional football, in the last few weeks, he has started to show that he can have the possibility to play and show his quality.”


The body count included a pair of young men carted off on stretchers and still more knocked out with serious injuries. Some were a result of routine plays that embody football’s existential risks, others were the offspring of more sinister intentions. Who can say, as the medics rush the field before a hushed stadium or from the antiseptic fluorescent buzz of a hospital room, which brand of violence is more concerning? Does it even matter?
One thing’s for certain: the grim tableau of carnage that was Monday night’s divisional grudge match between the Pittsburgh Steelers and Cincinnati Bengals, beamed in 4K ultra-high-definition to a national audience, comes at the worst possible time for a league beset with problems from all sides.
The first sobering moment came early on when Ryan Shazier, the Steelers’ Pro Bowl linebacker, immediately reached for the middle of his back after a delivering a head-first hit across the middle. The game was halted for several minutes as the 25-year-old was strapped to a backboard, carted off the field and taken to the hospital for tests amid fears of a spinal injury. (Thankfully, he will not require surgery “at this time”.)
What came next was hardly unavoidable: a parade of illegal hits and deliberate head shots between regional rivals bound by a well-documented antipathy. Steelers rookie JuJu Smith-Schuster detonated a vicious blindside block on Bengals linebacker Vontaze Burfict then preened over his motionless victim, prompting unfettered disgust from ESPN commentators Sean McDonough (“shame on him”) and Jon Gruden (who called it “sickening”). Not long after, Cincinnati safety George Iloka punctuated a game-tying touchdown catch by Pittsburgh star Antonio Brown with a late, high hit. (Iloka and Smith-Schuster have been suspended one game for their actions).
Pittsburgh quarterback Ben Roethlisberger, when asked to assess the brutality of the night in the immediate aftermath, offered a chilling assessment: “AFC North football.”
The Steelers’ comeback from 17-0 down in a prime-time game bursting with playoff implications should have been the topline, but the reaction from NFL insiders spoke volumes.
“This game is hard to watch for a number of reasons,” tweeted Hall of Fame quarterback Troy Aikman. “Terrible for the NFL and the game of football overall.”
“It’s beyond football,” Minnesota Vikings wideout Cris Carter said on Tuesday morning. “This isn’t what competition is about.”
Added one longtime Pittsburgh Tribune-Review correspondent: “Tonight in Cincinnati a lot of truly terrible things happened. One NFL team scored more than the other, but nobody ‘won.’”
For a league that’s made a strategic effort to persuade the public that it’s a worthy American pastime and not merely a vehicle for gratuitous violence, this was hardly a banner night. Television ratings continue to languish along with the quality of play. Look no further than the actual roll of starting quarterbacks for Week 13’s games, a who’s who that included: Jacoby Brissett, Ryan Fitzpatrick, Blaine Gabbert, Brett Hundley, DeShone Kizer, Josh McCown, Matt Moore, Tom Savage, Trevor Siemian, Geno Smith, Mitch Trubisky. Say nothing of the ongoing showdown with the president of the United States that’s represented a nightmare scenario for Roger Goodell’s pathologically apolitical operation as it’s ballooned into the biggest story in American sports.
What was once a unifying force in American life, shrewdly wrought as it was, has become just another casualty of the culture wars. But even that pales to the more existential question that’s become unavoidable to fans of football over the past decade: the moral dilemma of supporting a league whose practices far too often favor profit over basic human decency. Time and again the NFL, which has been accused of concealing the harmful effects of concussions, has prioritized the short-term effectiveness of players over their long-term well-being. Some owners like billionaire oil tycoon Jerry Jones, whose Dallas Cowboys recently unseated Real Madrid as the world’s most valuable sports team, even still continue to deny the connection between football and brain injuries, a stance evocative of the seven largest US tobacco company CEOs who collectively denied the addictive nature of nicotine before a congressional subcommittee in 1994.
Last month Bob Costas, who hosted NBC’s flagship Football Night in America program for more than a decade, articulated football’s bleak forecast at a roundtable discussion at the University of Maryland, saying “the reality is that this game destroys people’s brains” and that “the whole thing could collapse like a house of cards if people actually begin connecting the dots.”
“The cracks in the foundation are there,” Costas said. “The day-to-day issues, as serious as they may be, they may come and go. But you cannot change the nature of the game. I certainly would not let, if I had an athletically gifted 12- or 13-year-old son, I would not let him play football.”
He added: “There is no such thing as a safe blow to the head. And then when you have repeated blows to your head, it increases the risk of permanent brain damage. Once you start having hundreds or thousands of blows, there is a 100% risk of exposure to permanent brain damage. The brain does not have a reasonable capacity to regenerate. This is something we have always known.”
The ethical gymnastics demanded of NFL fans have grown more challenging over the past decade as the scientific evidence linking football with brain injuries mounts, forcing spectators to reconcile their thirst for the bone-crunching hits at the core of the league’s appeal with an inconvenient reality: that life-altering violence is not a bug or aberration but an essential feature.
“I hope my son plays golf,” Roethlisberger said later Monday night. “If he wants to play football, that’s fine, too. It’s a tough sport. It’s not for everyone.”
Grim spectacles like Monday’s have become far too common to represent any sort of watershed moment in football’s marginalization, but make no mistake: they are signposts on a one-way street.


Russia’s Olympic Committee has been banned from the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang and ordered to pay $15m in costs after making what the International Olympic Committee called an “unprecedented attack on the integrity of the Olympic Games and sport”.
Tellingly the IOC also accepted, for the first time, that the Russian state had been involved in widespread institutional doping by banning the then minister of sport, Vitaly Mutko, and his then deputy minister, Yuri Nagornykh, from any participation in all future Olympic Games.
It is the first time the IOC has imposed a ban on a country competing under its own flag for doping. Russia’s athletes were, however, thrown a lifeline by the IOC president, Thomas Bach, who confirmed they would be able to compete in South Korea in February provided they were not involved in a massive state-sponsored doping programme that corrupted the Sochi Winter Olympics in 2014. Such athletes will have to compete under the Olympic flag and in a uniform bearing the name “Olympic athlete from Russia”. If any Russian athlete wins a gold, the Olympic anthem will be played at the medal ceremony.
Mutko, who is now deputy prime minister for sport, tourism and youth policy and the head of the organising committee for the 2018 World Cup in Russia, rejected suggestions there had been systematic doping only last week. Fifa also released a statement on Tuesday insisting Mutko’s ban does not affect planning for next summer’s finals.
The IOC’s decision was announced after its 14-person executive committee spent Tuesday afternoon poring over the final report of the Schmid commission, which has been examining whether there was an “institutional conspiracy” by Russian officials within the ministry of sport to corrupt the London 2012 Olympics and the 2014 Sochi Winter Games.
Schmid’s dramatic conclusion was there had been a “systemic manipulation of the anti-doping system in Russia” and it had come under the authority of the Russian sports ministry.
As Bach put it in a press conference: “The report clearly lays out an unprecedented attack on the integrity of the Olympic Games and sport. As an athlete myself, I am feeling very sorry for all the clean athletes who have suffered from this manipulation.”
There have been suggestions a ban might lead to a Russian boycott of the Winter Olympics. However no such announcement has been made by Vladimir Putin or the Russian Olympic Committee. Nonetheless, many will feel the IOC has not punished Russia enough – and that the IOC has again ducked its responsibilities, just as it did 17 months ago when it decided to allow most of the country’s athletes into the Rio Olympics.
That decision came despite a report in July 2016 from the Canadian law professor Richard McLaren which found Russia’s government, security services and sporting authorities colluded to hide widespread doping across “a vast majority” of winter and summer sports. Some had feared a repeat performance from the IOC, despite a second report by McLaren in December 2016 which confirmed that more than 1,000 Russian athletes had been involved in, or benefited from, state-sponsored doping.
However in the past month there has been a change in tone and language by the IOC and the World Anti-Doping Agency. It started when Wada revealed it had received fresh evidence from a whistleblower that had “reinforced” McLaren’s findings. Separately, the Oswald commission, set up by the IOC to examine Russian doping in Sochi in 2014, began to ban Russian competitors from those Games retrospectively. So far the figure stands at 25 athletes, while 11 have had medals taken away.
The credibility of the Russian whistleblower Grigory Rodchenkov, who ran the Moscow anti-doping laboratory before fleeing last year and revealing what he knew to McLaren, was recently enhanced by the Oswald commission, who confirmed he was a “truthful witness”.
Rodchenkov responded to the news by saying he agreed with the IOC’s decision to allow some Russians into the Pyeongchang Games which begin on 9 February as neutral athletes. However, he said the problem was even bigger than indicated.
Rodchenkov’s lawyer, Jim Walden, said a new database, obtained by Wada last month, showed that “thousands and thousands and thousands” of Russian athletes were implicated in a “secret folder” which outlined all the times samples with performance-enhancing drugs in them had been switched for clean ones.
Added Walden: “It is a roadmap not just to 30 athletes or the 1,000 athletes that McLaren believes, but thousands and thousands were protected by the Russian system.”
In Fifa’s statement, which comes four days after the World Cup draw took place in Moscow, the governing body said it had taken note of the IOC’s decision and “it has no impact on the preparations for the 2018 World Cup”. It added: “Fifa takes its responsibility very seriously and is investigating the allegations made in the McLaren report. In this process, Fifa is working in close collaboration with Wada and has been in contact with Prof McLaren.
“Should there be enough evidence to demonstrate the violation of any anti-doping rules by any athlete, Fifa would impose the appropriate sanction.”


Manchester United and Chelsea play on Tuesday at the start of a few days of action that could end with no fewer than five English(ish) clubs reaching the last 16 of Big Cup as group winners. That would be an unprecedented achievement for any country, albeit one that would bear haunting similarities with the record of England’s national team, who generally also emerge from qualifying stages proudly flexing their muscles and pointing to their yellow belts in karate. And we all know who gets knocked out next.
Still, you have to hand it to the Premier League. It couldn’t have done much more so far than it has done, except perhaps lobby a little harder so that an even bigger number of VIP clubs gained admission to Big Cup at the expense of unphotogenic outfits from the nether regions. There remains the possibility that Manchester United and Chelsea will fritter away their privileges on Tuesday evening but it seems unlikely, especially in case of United, for whom that would entail finding a way to lose 5-1 at home to CSKA Moscow, which would be the most shocking European outcome ever experienced by an English outfit other than time Weird Uncle Fiver hadn’t noticed that unfortunately-placed hole in his dungarees.
Meanwhile in Scotland, there’s genuine glory afoot. Fresh from leading against Paris Saint-Germain for seven historic minutes in their last outing, the Queen’s Celtic will book a place in Big Vase simply by not soiling their breeches at home to Anderlecht. The Belgians, on the other hand, sound like they have already booked an appointment in their laundrette, with their manager’s lips all aquiver as he wibbled that their hosts “will fly like hell on the pitch so we have to be ready, their start will be possibly devastating”. That evoked a similarly pathetic speech given back in 1971 by Frank De Munck, manager of Lierse, who are the only Belgian club to have overturned a European tie after being pummelled in the home leg. “I do not think we can expect to beat them,” sobbed Munck before his team’s trip to Dirty Leeds, 2-0 winners in the first leg. “We will do our very best, but I think we will have to be satisfied if we can avoid a very heavy defeat.” Lierse won 4-0. But Brendan Rodgers would never leave a side open to such a European whupping, right?

“Winning the cup is a big thing and obviously it should be celebrated. But it is very possible to do so in a manner that shows the cup a bit more respect.

Kevin De Bruyne managed to keep a straight face when he said it was a shame that Paul Pogba will be out of Sunday’s Manchester derby. “It’s a competition, you want to play against the best teams and the best players,” he intoned, the corners of his mouth twitching all the time.

Lillestrom have been criticised for their celebrations after winning the Norwegian Cup with one of the players, Aleksander Melgalvis Andreassen, stripping naked on stage and placing the trophy in front of his genitals.
Lillestrom beat Sarpsborg 08 3-2 on Sunday to claim the cup but the governing body has said that it would have preferred the player to show the trophy “a little more respect”.
The Norwegian FA communications director, Yngve Haavik, told TV2: “Winning the Cup is a big thing and obviously it should be celebrated. But it is very possible to do so in a manner that shows the cup a bit more respect. I am sure it wasn’t intentional from Melgalvis but it came out the wrong way regardless. I think Melgalvis and Lillestrom agree with that.”
Melgalvis said that it was nothing he had planned and that he had done it spontaneously. “[Winning the cup] was something I never thought I would experience,” the 28-year-old told the newspaper Dagbladet. “I’ve come a long way to play in a cup final. Of course I can understand that [people thought] it was a bit over the top. I’ll admit that and apologise, but it is not something I regret.”
The midfielder was criticised in some quarters the day after the party but he did not regret the way he treated the King’s Trophy. “I can understand [that some people didn’t like it]. Should I apologise to the king? Well, I was very privileged to say hello to the king yesterday so maybe I should apologise today.”
Asked by the newspaper Verdens Gang whether his grandmother would be proud of him, Melgalvis said: “I don’t think she’s seen it. Fortunately she doesn’t have the internet or social media.”


Jimmy Anderson does his best work after midnight. Australian time. For cricket fans in this country, the presence of the world’s most productive seam bowler of this decade is more theoretical than palpable. He lives on cable TV in the middle of football season.
But his record in Australia? That is a story we’re familiar with. Sure he did well in 2010-11, but got properly carted in the whitewashes either side. He’s the guy George Bailey hit for a record 28 runs from an over. Bailey played five Tests.
Anderson isn’t that quick either, which is readily equated to not that good. Sure, he can nip it on a green-top in mild England, but how does he go on a flat track in an unforgiving Australian summer? Not well enough to be concerned about. Right?
Perhaps that’s what Steve Smith thought when allowing Anderson use of a new pink ball under lights. By the assessment of Australia’s assistant coach, David Saker, it backfired, giving England a puncher’s chance of a ridiculous victory. One made possible by Anderson, who picked a handy time to record his first five-wicket bag in Australia. Overall, he now has 25 of them, second only to Ian Botham’s 28 for England. Yep – just another trundler.
Being able to bowl rather than follow on was a gift that kept on giving for the 35-year-old, as he attacked the hosts’ edges and stumps until they were routed. No Australian got beyond 20, with none more exposed than Peter Handscomb. The Australia No5 was utterly worked over, before giving Anderson his wicket with a stroke he will never want to see on replay. It was a fitting end given just how out of touch he finds himself at this crucial part of the summer.
“Our plan is working,” Anderson said of success against the Victorian, attacking his stumps early when the right-hander sets up deep in the crease. Between Brisbane and Adelaide, Handscomb was dismissive of scrutiny about his stance from former players. He had succeeded against some of the best bowlers in the world, went his argument, so why should it be different against Anderson? That might need a rethink.
That’s easier than it sounds, as Simon Katich can attest. In the 2005 Ashes, he was suffering a similar problem in balance to the one he identifies in Handscomb at the moment. The intensity of that series made it impossible to make a meaningful technical adjustment mid-stream.
It leaves Handscomb vulnerable for the first time since winning his baggy green. On paper that looks incongruous to his batting average, north of 47 in 12 Tests so far; a man who played a vital hand to save a match in India earlier this year, and a very brave one to survive in the brutal heat of Bangladesh. Captaincy was supposed to be in Handscomb’s future, not exile.
Yet here he is, the man most likely to make way if Australia do elect to change the composition of their XI in favour of a batting all-rounder for Perth – the nation’s least forgiving surface this season. In the most recent two Sheffield Shield games at the ground, more than 2,800 runs have been tallied with 325 chased in one. It is not the place to go without a back-up for an injury-prone bowling attack.
Mark Waugh, a national selector, gave an insight into that preference last week. “Ideally, you want a man at six who bowls seam-up as your batting all-rounder.” With Mitchell Marsh bowling again, and having clobbered 95 and 141 in the aforementioned Waca run-fests, these dots don’t take much joining. And his older brother Shaun is going nowhere.
That this is a point of interest speaks to another sketchy day at the office for Australia. Teams that romp to a 2-0 lead and rub their opponents’ nose in it don’t get changed. “The last two days haven’t gone to plan,” Saker observed of the ongoing sore of having that second bat. “In hindsight, we didn’t get an opportunity to bowl with the new ball under lights. That was our chance. Maybe we got it wrong.” What he said.
Meanwhile, England go to bed halfway there, and still very much living on a prayer, but with confidence renewed from nowhere. “We are delighted to be in this position, to be in any chance to win this game,” said Anderson. He has earned his side a grandstand finish.


Martin Foyston walked away from a secure job in the analysis department at Fulham to embark on his dream of becoming a football coach. Four years on and the 35-year-old from Hull is assistant coach at Stromsgodset in Norway via stints with Swedish club Djurgarden and Norway’s national team.
“When you’re doing analysis, you’re so close with the first-team coaches and management,” explains Foyston. “You’re trying to paint their picture and if you do it for long enough you learn something. It’s a tough job and you work long hours but when Roy Hodgson became manager at Fulham in late 2007 I started to get interested in the coaching side of things. He just made everything a lot clearer. For two and a half years, the best coach in England, as far as I’m concerned, was able to make football simple in the most effective way. Everything he said over that period just made sense.
“That’s when I knew I wanted to become a coach. I worked closely with Roy and his coaches, Billy McKinlay, Ray Lewington and Mike Kelly, and it was like a football degree every day. Ray was the nicest guy in the world. He’s able to tell a footballer he’s done something wrong but the player is uplifted by it rather than feeling he’s having a finger pointed at him. When I’m at work now I still think to myself: ‘What would Roy and Ray do?’”
Foyston had joined Fulham straight from university in 2005 after studying for a career in the big screen. “When I was younger all I’d ever wanted to do was be a footballer,” he says. “I played football all the way up to youth level with Hull City but didn’t get a professional contract. I ended up going to college and university and doing a film studies and media production course. I liked the technology part more than the creative part.
“When I saw the Fulham analysis job advertised, I saw I could do everything they were asking. Analysis in football was still in its early stages. When I went for my interview, there were still VHS tapes and recorders dotted around the room. It was a very laboured system back then. I was more enthusiastic than fully qualified but I got the job.
“I was initially in charge of pre-match and putting clips from the scout reports on the opposition into a video for the manager. Then I also took on post-match duties. The gaffer would come in and say: ‘I want this, I want that, because of this and because of that.’ As you develop, you become more of the instigator and you have the clips ready before they ask for them.”
By this stage Fulham were an established Premier League side. But, in early 2013, Foyston made the decision to leave Craven Cottage and head overseas in search of his first coaching role. “I’d been at Fulham for a good few years. On top of my day job, I’d done my B Licence and was about to start my A Licence, but I just felt that nothing was going to fall into my lap to get a job as a coach. I had too much ambition to continue doing the same role. It was a fantastic job but I wanted to do something else.
“One day I said: ‘Right, that’s it, I’m going to go to Sweden.’ I’m quite an impulsive person. My girlfriend at the time, who’s now my wife, was fine with it as she’s Swedish so she was going home. And she knew I wasn’t going to change my mind. I also knew Sweden would be a good level for me to go into. I felt the experience I had with Fulham would give me a chance to find a job in that country.
“When I told Fulham I’d decided to move on, they felt I wasn’t telling the whole story and had another job in the Premier League. But the truth was I didn’t have anything to go to. I just felt I needed to put myself in an uncomfortable position and force myself to go in search of my goal. I didn’t want to have a security blanket and a safety net to fall back into. It was do or die. I knew it was a big risk. Not many people walk away from a Premier League job and I was very close with then-Fulham boss Martin Jol. He was a real father figure to me. But I had to go for it.”
Having been at Fulham for a number of years, Foyston was a popular member of the setup and was presented with a parting gift from Damien Duff. “When I was leaving, he gave me a book, The Alchemist. It’s a fable about following your dream. He wrote a little passage on the first page saying he felt the book would be important for me as I went on my journey. I’m not much of a reader but I read it on the flight to Stockholm and I thought: ‘This can be me.’”
Foyston made a new home in Stockholm but went without work for three months, even turning down an analysis role at Elfsborg. “They had just won the league and the manager at the time, Jorgen Lennartsson, called me and asked if I wanted to be their analyst as they were going into Europe the next season. It was good money and the chance to start afresh but I thought, if I did it I’d be taking the easy option, so I didn’t accept it.”
An old Fulham contact gave Foyston a helping hand in securing an interview for his first coaching role. “Magnus Pehrsson left Djurgardens in late July and was replaced by Per-Mathias Hogmo,” he explains. “I knew Brede Hangeland had played with him for Norway’s Under-21s. So I called Brede and asked for his help and he rang Pet-Mathias on my behalf. The next thing I was going for an interview. We talked about my experiences and what I’d come to Sweden to do. By the end of the interview he’d offered me a job as assistant coach.
“The way Djurgardens played was the same way Roy had at Fulham and a system I felt strongly about. I felt comfortable going into the job. We had a fantastic end to the season. I spoke Swedish but most of the players were fluent in English so there was no language barrier. And because we’d done so well, Per-Mathias was offered the Norway job. He said he wanted me to go with him, but I’d only been with Djurgardens for six months.
“I said I’d do the national job on a part-time basis and juggle both roles. It had all come a little bit too quick for me and I wanted to stay at Djurgardens to continue learning. But ambition takes over. A new coach came to Djurgardens [Per Olsson] and we started to play a bit differently. It didn’t feel like the same Djurgardens to me and my role became a little bit less. I decided to take the Norway job on a full-time basis in August 2014.”
Despite being set a remit of reducing the average age of the Norway team, the country’s failure to qualify for Euro 2016 put the pressure on. After a series of defeats in qualifying for the 2018 World Cup, Hogmo stepped down in November 2016.
“It was a tough one,” reflects Foyston. “We took the direction that we were going to start afresh and bring in a lot of young players. In our last game of Euro qualification, we were playing Italy away in Rome. We were 17 minutes away from winning and finishing top of our group, but football is a game of fine margins. A cross came in around the 73rd minute and, instead of clearing the ball, one of our defenders decides to try to chest it back to the keeper. It falls short, Italy score and we eventually lose 2-1. We ended up finishing third in the group and went into a play-off with Hungary.
“From being underdogs throughout the whole qualification period, suddenly we were expected to kill Hungary. We sold out the national stadium and the expectation changed. That played a big part in regards to the stress and pressure that went into those play-off games. We lost.
“After we were beaten by the Czech Republic in a World Cup qualifier, Per-Mathias decided he was going to quit. I was gutted to see him go; I owe Per-Mathias everything. I still had a job with Norway but I was approached by the manager of Stromsgodset, Tor Ole Skullerud, who I had briefly worked with for Norway when he was assistant coach.
“I was still under contract with Norway until 2017. I could have stayed and been paid for another year but an agreement was reached for me to go to Stromsgodset. We had a difficult start, but since June we really picked up and the last couple of months have been great. One day I’d like to have that ambition of being a manager, but right now I’m concentrating on being the best I can be in the role that I have. If anything comes as a result of that in the next few years, we’ll take it from there.”

Jimmy Anderson, after claiming his maiden five-wicket haul in Australia, revealed the desire to keep proving age is merely a number remains one of the major driving forces behind these golden late years of his record-breaking career.
Though the leading wicket-taker on either side during the victorious 2010-11 Ashes tour, Anderson had never raised the ball to an Australian crowd. But when Mitchell Starc mistimed a shot to mid-off at the tail end of the home side’s 138 all out, the 35-year-old got his moment.
“People keep telling me that I’m about to finish and retire but I want to show them I can keep going,” said Anderson, who now has 47 wickets at 15 apiece in 2017. “I’ve still got wickets left in me, wicket-taking balls, and hopefully that can continue on this trip.
“Everything’s clicked. I’ve felt in good rhythm throughout the year, I feel like I’m bowling as well as I ever have and my body is in as good a shape as it ever has been. I’m loving playing cricket and so as long as I’m bowling well and doing myself justice I’ll keep playing.”
That the second Test remained intriguingly poised at stumps on the fourth day, with England 178 runs from their target of 354 with six wickets in hand, owed much to their all-time leading wicket-taker’s efforts after Steve Smith opted to bat again under lights on the third evening.
Whatever the end result, Anderson said England have shown fight and character. But having started brightly at the Gabba and faded – and then begun slowly in Adelaide before a surge – his words mean little unless such performances can be strung together.
Anderson added: “At some point we’ve got to start learning from the positions we get ourselves in. We were in strong positions in Brisbane and didn’t capitalise. We’ve come here and we were way behind the game. We’ve shown that’s not a fair reflection on how good we are as a team.
“We’ve come back and shown people that we can compete with Australia and we can cause them problems with bat and ball. It is a case of doing it for longer periods of time and not just a day here and a day there.”
A huge plus for Joe Root’s attack is the stifling of Smith in Adelaide, having watched him strike an unbeaten 141 in the first Test before a change of tack – chiefly getting the Australia captain into a verbal battle – has returned scores of 40 and six.
On this, Anderson explained: “I think it did work because we got him out quite cheaply. I think picking the right time to do something like that to get someone out of their little bubble and unsettle them is a good thing. Steve seemed more interested in chatting to me and Stuart [Broad] than focusing on his job. So that was a job well done from our point of view.”


In the shadow of the towering stands of Borussia Dortmund’s Westfalenstadion just up the road, 16 refugees from around the world are engaged in a frenetic game of football. After a particularly heavy challenge, Shamil Ilqasim, a 19-year-old Yazidi from northern Iraq, limps to the sideline with a beaming smile across his face. “I’ve just hurt my leg but I’ll be back on soon, don’t worry,” Shamil, who is wearing a Dortmund shirt and shorts combined with Hertha Berlin socks, assures me.
He is part of the Welcome to Football initiative that was instigated by the German Football League (DFL) in September 2015 and has led to 24 of the country’s professional clubs running similar schemes to this one. In conjunction with the local amateur side TSC Eintracht Dortmund and with funding from the DFL and the German Children and Youth Foundation, the Bundesliga club’s BVB Foundation has helped to create a project that is now in its third year and allows a group of refugees aged between 18 and 20 to attend a weekly training session at TSC’s stadium, where they also receive a free meal beforehand and a German lesson afterwards.
“It’s really enjoyable,” says Shamil. “We play every week, we eat here and we have everything provided. I’m here with my family but it is more important for those who don’t have any family. It makes us forget some of our problems.
“I used to play football in Iraq but in 2014 Isis came to my country and it was very hard because my best friend … Kalashnikov,” he adds, his voice trailing away. “It was very difficult for me. I still remember my friend but I feel like Germany is my home now. When I arrived here, because I didn’t speak any of the language it was hard. But now things are getting better.”
Students from refugee communities attending local schools are rewarded for good behaviour with a year-long place on the course, with organisers also helping to find them jobs and university places afterwards. As well as providing coaching and equipment, Dortmund continue to give away free tickets for their matches after famously inviting 220 refugees to a match in 2015, a number that was reported to have outstripped the total number of Syrians given asylum by the UK in the 18 previous months.
“Three years ago, many refugees arrived in the city and we wanted to support them and the volunteers,” explains Thomas Klein, from Borussia Dortmund’s corporate social responsibility department. “But as well as giving away tickets, we wanted to support something sustainable and were very glad when we heard about the idea from the DFL. It allowed us to create possibilities for the refugees to integrate into German culture and the community. We are very glad when a refugee comes to us and says, ‘Sorry I can’t come to training any more because I have a job’. That’s a great situation. We want to help the people who want to stay in Germany and integrate.”
After the launch of the campaign in 2015, several other Bundesliga sides have implemented similar initiatives, including Werder Bremen’s “Stay on the Ball” project and Bayer Leverkusen’s “Bayer 04 does school” – where the focus is on helping refugee children take steps to join a local club. Around 65 training sessions involving around 800 refugees aged between four and 30 take place in Germany every week, with as many as 600 having gone on to play in local amateur leagues.
Wolfgang Euteneuer, a former professional for VfL Bochum who now runs the Welcome to Dortmund charity that provides support to refugees in the city, believes the support of professional clubs has been hugely beneficial.
“In one case, BVB helped a young boy who was being sent back to Kosovo,” he recalls. “In his appeal, they wrote that he is always here playing football and learning German. When we went to his hearing in Düsseldorf, this paper helped persuade them to allow him to stay.”
Ali El-Kadri arrived in Germany in 2015 after fleeing his town just outside Damascus in Syria. It took him several months of travelling on his own via Turkey, Greece and Serbia using whatever means necessary to reach Dortmund. Now 19, he plans to go to university next year and has been using the opportunity to brush up on his football and language skills.
“I used to play in Syrian Under-17s team back home,” he says. “I love football and am always trying to get better so hopefully one day I can play for a big club like BVB. It was very hard to come here without my parents and learn a new language and a new culture. But this project has helped me improve my knowledge of German and make some new friends. That is important because you need to have a high level of German to be able to go to university. Playing football gives me the inspiration to do well in the rest of my life.”
As the training session draws to a close, the group head indoors to a classroom for their hour-long German lesson. With most having already spent the morning working or at college, it is a long day but there is no lack of enthusiasm when the conversation turns to the previous evening’s 2-2 draw between Germany and France in nearby Cologne. Most admit they will be supporting reigning champions Die Mannschaft at the World Cup in Russia next year, although there are a few who clearly have a soft spot for England.
At present, only a handful of clubs in the Premier League such as Arsenal, Everton and Leicester are running regular projects for refugees, while the Football Association donated several free tickets to some for England’s draws with Germany and Brazil at Wembley last month. But after the success of Football Welcomes, a weekend of activities held in April, Naomi Westland from Amnesty International is hoping many more will now follow Germany’s example.
“I’d like to see football clubs working with other organisations in their communities to support and welcome refugees,” she says. “They play a really important role in integration and social cohesion in their communities and people listen to what they say. This is a really good model to show how that partnership can work. At a time when police reports show a rise in xenophobia and hate crimes it seems to be more important than it has ever been. We want people to feel welcome when they arrive in a new country.”
Every player is presented with a bright yellow Dortmund training top at the end of the class before they begin to make their way home, but not before the final word from their coach and mentor Hassan Al Moula, whose family moved to Germany from Lebanon to escape the civil war in the 1980s.
“It’s very important to learn respect and fair play because that’s vital if you want to stay in Germany,” he says passionately. “You can make a mistake in society but you have to set a good example and try to integrate. Rules on the pitch are important rules in life.”


The twilight zone. Though 24 hours later than many expected, England got their moment under lights on the fourth evening in Adelaide and through Joe Root, Dawid Malan and some pyromaniacal reviews by Steve Smith, somehow the tourists remained in the hunt.
Whatever the result on the final day, this was the kind of session for which day-night Test cricket was designed. A hooping pink ball, a straining attack and batsmen battling hard to get just shy of halfway in their pursuit of 354 – Ashes cricket might not need the format to sell out grounds but the glow of the outfield, the flash of the pink ball and the changing night sky worked a treat.
This was two and a half hours of creeping optimism for those England fans on the hill – deflated slightly late on by Pat Cummins – as Root and Malan nudged, nurdled and generally repelled Australia. Smith, having gone too big, too early in trying to overturn marginal calls, became a target for the Barmy Army, who offered sozzled review signs for every appeal thereafter.
Though his bails were lit up late on by Cummins, Malan showed grit for his 29 having been struck in the face by the brawny quick before surviving a drop at slip by Smith off Nathan Lyon. Root, who reached the close unbeaten on 67 and was joined by the ever-dependable Chris Woakes as the nightwatchman, was deeply impressive.
Yes there were brushes with disaster, such as Root surviving a review on 32 when given out lbw to Lyon or the cover drive that burst through the hands of Cameron Bancroft when the England captain was on 60. But somehow, through a typically frisky innings and the efforts of his bowlers, the pressure of his decision to bowl at the toss has flipped back on to Smith, whose third-day call not to enforce the follow-on has dominated the local narrative.
After stumps it continued, with David Saker – the Australia assistant coach who was once of the England camp – ruing the fact his side been denied the luxury of using a new ball under lights, such as the tourists had the night before. It was pointed out Smith had in fact eschewed it.
“In hindsight it probably is [a regret],” Saker said. “We probably didn’t think it would move like it did [on the third evening] and it was tough. Jimmy Anderson was magnificent and Chris Woakes was very good. Given those conditions, we could have done a similar job.”
On the delight the England fans took at Smith burning reviews and then seeing decisions go against him, Saker said: “I was on the other side for five years and I did enjoy the Barmy Army – it was wearing a bit thin today but they are part of the beauty of Ashes cricket.”
The surge of hope had begun from a low point as, only six overs after the dinner break and under the developing violet sky, James Vince trudged off with 15 to his name and the score 91 for three. A wafty drive to a wide one from Mitchell Starc, a snick and a cerise gift for the otherwise embattled Peter Handscomb at second slip – this was a case of Vince and repeat.
From his 12 dismissals to seamers at Test level, there have been nine held between keeper and gully. “Nick city” was how the likeable Kerry O’Keefe, on the matey-blokey TripleM radio commentary, described the right-hander’s open bat face in his first innings just seconds before Josh Hazlewood exploited this exact glitch via a tame punch to a ball.
But what to do? England have selected Vince in the hope the right-hander’s game can transfer to Australia’s surface in the way his supposed clone, Michael Vaughan, managed 15 years ago. In his first innings 83 at Brisbane, you could see why the punt was taken.
In reserve sits Gary Ballance, currently mixing the drinks – isotonic, not gin and tonic – on his second successive tour, between which was a brief third spell in the Test side last summer in which he got set in three of his four innings without ever kicking on. Remember, it was only his broken finger that opened the door for the since‑discarded Tom Westley.
Ballance will likely get his chance in the two-day tour match at Perth this weekend but counting against him – beyond the doubts about the Yorkshireman at No3 and the fact Root is wedded to No4 – would be the throwing of yet another top six left-hander to Lyon. The former Adelaide groundsman has gone from sowing seeds to sowing serious doubts.
The Lyon factor, plus credit from Brisbane, will likely prompt another chance for Vince albeit on the bounciest of the Australian pitches. But when Root and Malan were battling it out in the twilight zone, his latest offering was made to look all the more flaky.


Maro Itoje is a doubt for the start of England’s Six Nations campaign after Saracens confirmed he suffered a broken jaw during the club’s 20-19 defeat by Harlequins last Sunday.
Itoje left the field early in the second half with blood pouring from his mouth and was taken to hospital where scans have revealed a fracture. England begin the defence of their Six Nations title away to Italy on 4 February and the top-end of the recovery timeframe for a broken jaw can be up to 10 weeks. Itoje’s England team-mate Anthony Watson spent two months on the sidelines with a similar injury last autumn.
It means Eddie Jones faces a nervous wait with the 23-year-old lock due to see a specialist later this week, when the length of his absence will become clearer. He is however certain to miss Saracens’ back-to-back Champions Cup matches against last year’s finalists Clermont Auvergne, the first of which is on Sunday at Allianz Park.
It is a major blow for Saracens, the two-times defending European champions who have lost their last five matches in all competitions, including three in a row in the Premiership. Itoje made his return for the club in the loss at Harlequins, having been absent for Saracens throughout the autumn internationals despite starting only one of England’s three matches.
Before the autumn break however, Itoje had started eight of Saracens’ first nine matches of the season, on the back of playing 34 games last term, including all three British & Irish Lions Tests.
Saracens currently top their Champions Cup pool following bonus points wins against Northampton and the Ospreys but Clermont are a point behind having also won their first two matches.
Manu Tuilagi has been backed to re-emerge as one of the world’s best outside centres when he finally makes his comeback from injury this month. The powerful England midfielder is on the verge of a club return for Leicester, probably in next week’s home European pool game against Munster, and the Tigers’ management believe the 26-year-old’s best days are still ahead of him.
Tuilagi has been plagued by groin, hamstring and knee injuries which prompted him to visit a witch-doctor in Samoa earlier this year in an effort to accelerate his recovery.
Leicester are wary of rushing him back for Saturday’s fixture against Munster in Limerick but Matt O’Connor, the club’s director of rugby, predicts the player will return with a bang within the next fortnight.
“A fully fit Manu is the best 13 in the world,” said O’Connor, as eager as anyone to see Tuilagi back in action. “He’s a special player … he brings a different level. He’s got to come back, he’s got to play footy but he’s that good. I think there would be a lot of people who’d agree with me.”
There are those who also wonder if Tuilagi’s power-laden frame is simply too heavy for his ligaments to cope with but O’Connor insists he is in prime shape. “He’s too powerful for everyone else’s body, I don’t know about his own,” said the Australian. “In isolation the injuries are not a big deal but when you put them back to back he’s missed a lot of footy over the last couple of seasons. It’s a frustration for him and everybody else. He’s got so much potential. He’s box office and everyone wants to see him play.
“There’s been an element of bad luck to it. Hopefully with the witch doctor’s help we’re past that. He’s fit, he’s training, he’s doing really well. It’s just about how we reintroduce him. There’s no such thing as slow and steady with Manu. He doesn’t do that very well. When he’s good to go we’ll put him out there.”
Tuilagi, who has spent more time sidelined than playing since 2014, would certainly be an eye-catching addition to England’s Six Nations squad if he impresses Jones, who is in Japan checking on 2019 Rugby World Cup venues. “Whenever he comes back and plays he’s aerobically very good and he copes with the collisions brilliantly,” said O’Connor. “We’ll just make sure we don’t put him under too much pressure. He will be involved in the next couple of weeks, for sure but we’ve got a duty of care to make sure he is at the top of his game when he does come back.”


After England’s traumas of the first two and a half days it was remarkable that as the players left the field on the fourth night the outcome of the match had yet to be decided. Indeed it was not even certain which side was going to win. At the close England were 176 for four. So they needed 178 more runs for victory, Australia needed six wickets.
This unexpected equation had three components. First there was Steve Smith’s remarkable decision not to enforce the follow-on on Monday night, although it came as a surprise only to those who played in the 20th century; the modern cricketer does not appear to have the flexibility of mind to appreciate that enforcing the follow-on can be advantageous. Then there was England’s pace-bowling in Australia’s second innings; it was brimful of zest and discipline, spearheaded by Jimmy Anderson, who produced his first five-wicket haul in Australia, and Chris Woakes, who took four wickets. Stuart Broad also bowled excellently and one day he might be persuaded to explain that he deserved at least one victim as a reward in that first session.
But the toughest part still remained –scoring 354 runs, and England fans could still dream about that on Tuesday night because Joe Root, drawing on all his talent and resolve, was still there on 67 after batting on a plane beyond his team-mates.
One of England’s problems in the series so far has been producing a major innings. Here their first three threatened again but could not consolidate significantly. Once again Alastair Cook batted calmly against the pacemen only to succumb to Nathan Lyon’s off-spin for the second time in the match.
He is more vulnerable against this type of bowling than he was as a novice; the advent of DRS cannot help but there is more to it than that. Here he was lbw on review as he attempted to nurdle a leg side single after he and Mark Stoneman had added a sparky 53 runs.
The sparkiness had come from Stoneman, who took 15 runs from a Mitchell Starc over with authoritative clips through midwicket. But when Cook departed the pressure was back on with a vengeance; Stoneman became tentative and jabbed a catch into the gully. Once again he had been very impressive in the early overs. James Vince also settled well, looking the part until his familiar exit, edging behind when cover-driving.
At 91 for three it looked bleak for the tourists and there were now some close shaves; Root was given lbw to Lyon but reprieved on review. Then Australia betrayed their anxiety. They sought a review for a caught behind against Root off Pat Cummins – to no avail. In the next over they asked for another review, for an lbw appeal from Josh Hazlewood against Dawid Malan, quite a compliment for the left-hander. Again the ball was going over the stumps and suddenly both Australian reviews had gone in the space of five minutes.
Beyond those anxieties Root timed the ball neatly on both sides of the wicket, scoring at a pace that few have matched in this game. However he lost Malan for a gutsy 29 10 minutes before the close, whereupon Woakes appeared as a nightwatchman with more talent than most.
If only England had displayed the same skill and resolution earlier in the match. Their pacemen were on song on Tuesday afternoon in a manner that would have been useful on Saturday. They capitalised on the excellent work of the previous evening. There was only one puzzling period when Root opted for five overs of Moeen Ali’s gentle off-spin – he is not at his best at the moment – rather than entrusting more overs to Craig Overton.
However his fast bowlers were as accurate and frugal in the daylight as they had been in the dark. Yet again Anderson suffered the exasperation of seeing the umpire’s finger raised only to be denied by a review. This time it related to an appeal for a slip catch from the third ball of the day when Peter Handscomb was on strike. After much agonising the third umpire, Marais Erasmus, saw no contact.
The nightwatchman, Nathan Lyon, was hit on the helmet by a Broad bouncer and soon after holed out to mid-off against Anderson. Then came the more important wicket of Handscomb, who was neatly caught in the gully by Malan.
Handscomb’s innings was not a thing of beauty and it remains something of a mystery how his Test batting average hovers around 50. He gets into some extraordinary positions.
The Australian Test selectors may well be scratching their heads about him and this knock also prompted a tweet about Handscomb from the sage PA man from Yorkshire, David Clough, which was brought to my attention: “Aussie-raised of English descent but reckon he must have learnt how to bat in Provence.”
Now Woakes struck at the other end. Tim Paine top-edged a bouncer and the ball swirled towards Overton at long leg. The debutant may not have been in the perfect position for a very tricky catch but he made damn sure that he hung on to the chance. He willed the ball into his hands and kept it there as he hit the ground from a great height.
Shaun Marsh had been watchful again but after adding 32 runs with Starc he was bowled through the gate by Woakes. Starc soon became Anderson’s fifth victim and when Overton was summoned to replace Woakes he dismissed Hazlewood with his sixth ball of the day. A substantial target had been set but not quite in the manner planned by the Australia captain. Nor was that target quite as large as Smith had expected.


Tuesdays in December will never be a natural home for top-class racing, but Tuesday afternoon’s jumps card at Southwell is more than adequate for betting purposes, with nearly £60,000 in prize money including £17,000 for the novice handicap chase.
This race has, frustratingly, attracted just seven runners, but all seven have some form to their name that gives them at least a sniff of a chance. The two to concentrate on, though, could be Eyeswideopenawake and Get Rhythm (12.50), with marginal preference for the latter on the back of his close second at Lingfield last time out. The two market leaders look likely to duel for the lead up front and both jumped impeccably in their most recent starts, but Get Rhythm may be the more natural two-miler of the pair.
The £10,000 handicap hurdle later on the card has drawn a field of 13, but the lightly raced favourite, Red Rising (1.50), should be spot on for this after finishing a good third on his first start for eight months at Chepstow last time.
Tzar De L’Elfe (2.00) has yet to get his head in front but showed promise on his British chase debut and should be suited by this step up in trip, while Frederic (2.40) catches the eye at a decent price on the all-weather card at Wolverhampton. Captain Navarre is an obvious favourite here after an impressive success at Kempton last time out, but Keith Dalgleish’s runner recorded two wins for the yard earlier in the season and remains unexposed on artificial surfaces. Anything close to his best form would take him very close.

A Sri Lankan player vomited on the field and was escorted off the ground as heavily polluted air continued to plague an international cricket test match in Delhi.
The fast bowler Suranga Lakmal was seen doubled over and retching on Tuesday afternoon as levels of the most harmful pollutants hovered at about 300 micrograms per cubic metre in parts of the Indian capital – 12 times the World Health Organisation safe limit.
Lakmal was one of the players to be badly affected on Sunday when air pollution forced a break in play in the test between India and Sri Lanka, the first such interruption in international cricket history. He and another bowler, Lahiru Gamage, were forced to abandon bowling duties mid-over for a spell in the changing rooms where the coach, Nic Pothas, said Lakmal was “continuously vomiting”.
Lakmal was helped off the ground on Tuesday by a Sri Lankan team physiotherapist after his team-mates – mostly playing in pollution masks – rushed to his aid. Later the Indian pacer Mohammed Shami also vomited. Groundsmen scattered sawdust.
The scenes at Feroz Shah Kotla stadium have fuelled a debate in India over whether Delhi should be permitted to hold sporting events during winter when year-round pollution in the city reaches severe levels.
The Indian cricket board said on Monday that in future it would consider amending its schedules based on pollution forecasts.
“Scheduling of matches in Delhi during this time of the year will be considered,” said Amitabh Chaudhary, the acting secretary of the Board of Control for Cricket in India.
The acting president of the board, CK Khanna, had earlier dismissed concerns, saying: “If 20,000 people in the stands did not have problems and the Indian team did not face any issue ... the Sri Lankan team made a big fuss?”
Javier Ceppi, the director of the Fifa under-17 World Cup held in India in October, wrote on Twitter after Sunday’s incidents that Delhi could not host sporting events from Diwali until the end of February “at least”.
You can't host sport events in Delhi from Diwali till end of Feb, at least. It is a fact. We had to accommodate our whole schedule to avoid it and others should also think about athletes health first #DelhiSmog
The Indian Medical Association also condemned the decision to let the Delhi test go ahead. “You have fast bowlers, batsmen and fielders out there exposed to these very harmful pollutants over five days at a stretch. It takes a serious toll on your health in the long run,” said the association’s president, KK Aggarwal.
Indian players and the match umpires have almost all eschewed masks throughout the test and some fans accused the Sri Lankans of grandstanding, pointing out that India’s captain, Virat Kohli, posted a record double-century despite the conditions.
The atmosphere in Delhi is dense with carcinogenic chemicals fine enough to lodge deep in the lungs and breach the blood-brain barrier. Multiple studies have linked the pollution to higher rates of lung cancer, heart disease and chronic respiratory conditions in the long-term, while immediate exposure can trigger asthma attacks and cause discomfort to the eyes and throat.
Indian environmental authorities said pollution levels last year exceeded those recorded during the 1952 great smog of London, considered one of Britain’s worst environmental disasters.
Contributors to the poor air in the city include road dust, open fires, vehicle exhaust fumes, industrial emissions and the burning of crop waste in neighbouring states, all of which worsen in winter when winds slow and air is trapped closer to the ground.
Delhi and surrounding states have implemented separate action plans that are unevenly enforced. A lasting solution would require national coordination while simultaneously tackling the myriad sources of poor air, a challenging task in a country with generally limited law enforcement.


The International Cricket Council’s anti-corruption unit is understood to be conducting up to seven live investigations into fixing, with three international captains having reported illicit approaches in the past two months.
Of the captains, two names have already leaked. Pakistan’s Sarfraz Ahmed and Graeme Cremer of Zimbabwe have been reported to have rebuffed offers from intermediaries and flagged them up to the relevant authorities within an hour. The identity of the third is yet to be established and the ICC does not comment in such instances.
Sarfraz, whose Pakistan side won the ICC Champions Trophy in June, was contacted before a one-day match against Sri Lanka in Abu Dhabi in October, while Cremer was reported to have rejected an offer by a former Zimbabwe Cricket board member to fix elements of their Test series against West Indies the same month.
That such high-profile names are being approached is alarming – although their response is viewed as evidence the education programmes are working – while the number of live cases shows the size of the task facing the ICC’s new ACU general manager, Alex Marshall, who began in September after a long career in the British police.
Of huge concern to the ACU is the proliferation of privately-owned micro-tournaments in the subcontinent and the Middle East, which feature local players and the odd recently retired “star”, and are seen as a possible entry-point for would-be corrupters into higher level scams.
The money on offer is understood to range from US$5,000 to $150,000, with the ICC having become increasingly aware that both women’s cricket, as revealed by the Guardian, and the under-17 and under-19 levels of are becoming areas of interest to match-fixers. The age group levels in particular are seen as a way of compromising young cricketers in order to exploit this further when their careers progress.
Since September, a revision to the ICC’s anti-corruption code has given investigators powers to request that players, coaches or administrators – at any level – hand over their mobile phones in order to access information. Reasonable grounds for doing so are required but refusal can now result in a two-year ban.
Marshall, who began his role as the new code came into effect, has been in Adelaide this week for meetings with Australian federal police and other agencies to improve the lines of communication and the pooling of information. It is the latest in a series of such visits around the world.


Sunday was another tough night for LA basketball. The Los Angeles Lakers’ losing streak increased to five games after the Houston Rockets blew them out 118-95. Meanwhile the injury-plagued Clippers lost their third straight, falling to the Minnesota Timberwolves 112-106. Despite coming into this season with radically different expectations, both teams have won just eight games and have a long way to go if they want to make it above the .500 mark. While it’s still early in the season, there’s a strong possibility that we could be heading towards the first NBA postseason without an LA-based team since 2005.
It’s been a particularly unusual time to be a Lakers fan as their team has already missed four straight postseasons, by far their longest playoff drought. In fact, prior to this stretch, they had missed the playoffs in back-to-back seasons only once before, in 1974-76. Since 1960, when they moved from Minnesota (hence their geographically suspect nickname) to become the first NBA team on the West Coast the Lakers have won 25 conference titles and 11 championships, including two three-peats. This is a team that has showcased a laundry list of superstar players including Jerry West, Wilt Chamberlain, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Magic Johnson, James Worthy, Shaquille O’Neal and Kobe Bryant.
Even if the Lakers hadn’t established themselves as one of the most successful and popular franchises in US sports, the Clippers were always going to be the lesser loved of the two teams. They began life as the Buffalo Braves in 1970 before moving to San Diego in 1978 and rebranding themselves as the Clippers. They then moved to LA in 1984, just in time to be completely overshadowed by Johnson’s “Showtime Lakers” teams, whose epic battles with Larry Bird’s Boston Celtics helped revive the league and laid the groundwork for the modern day NBA.
Of course, it’s doubtful that the Clippers would have gained a large fanbase even if they had an entire major market to themselves. For most of their existence the Clippers have played awful, uninspired basketball. They wouldn’t make their first playoffs as the Clippers until the 1991-92 season. They lost in the first round, something that would become a fairly common result on those rare occasions that they actually managed to qualify for the postseason.
Much of the blame for the Clippers’ legacy of losing has to be placed on Donald Sterling, the bigoted slumlord and notorious cheapskate who owned the Clippers from 1981 to 2014, when the NBA finally banned him for life after he was caught on tape making racist remarks. During his reign, the Clippers weren’t just bad on the court, they were an absolutely toxic organization with a reputation for making players miserable, a situation that ensured that free agents tended to give the team a wide berth.
However, even before former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer bought the team in August 2014, it the Clippers’ luck was changing. IN 2009, they drafted No1 pick Blake Griffin who, after losing his entire rookie year to a knee injury, developed into one of the best players in the league. Then, in 2011, the Clippers pulled off a trade for all-star point guard Chris Paul after the league controversially voided a trade that would have sent him to, who else, but the Lakers. This, obviously, was considered a double win for long-suffering Clippers fans.
With the Lakers mired in the longest slump of their existence, due in part to Kobe Bryant’s drawn-out decline, the Clippers finally established themselves as the most successful NBA team in the city. They had a new owner, the most talented team in franchise history and a proven head coach in Doc Rivers, who led the Boston Celtics to a title in the 2008 NBA finals.
Now, it’s hard to argue that the Clippers haven’t been successful during that stretch. They have made the playoffs in each of the last six seasons, a genuine accomplishment since they before that they had made a grand total of four postseason appearances since moving to LA. Still it’s equally hard to argue that the Clippers have been able to take advantage of the Lakers’ recent struggles.
It’s understandable that the Clippers didn’t win a title, especially considering that their best seasons occurred right when the Western Conference became historically competitive, but the Clippers failed to even make their first conference championship appearance. As good as they have been over the last few years, they haven’t been able to overcome injuries to their most important players, notoriously thin benches and good old fashioned “Clippers luck.”
Now their window might be closed. The Clippers traded Paul to the Houston Rockets in the offseason. While there was some hope that the team could build around Griffin in the way that the Rockets have built around James Harden and the Oklahoma City Thunder are attempting to do with Russell Westbrook, Griffin’s latest knee injury has probably put an end to that particular fantasy.
At this point of the season, the Clippers and Lakers have won the same number of games, but that doesn’t mean that they’re both on equal ground. The Clippers came into this season thinking that they were going to be a competitive playoff team and hoping to avoid having to go through a messy rebuild that would essentially end their latest attempt at stealing the spotlight away from their intra city rivals. Meanwhile, the Lakers had absolutely no intent on building a winning team last off-season. Instead they concentrated on clearing away the cap space so they can sign two superstar players next summer, possibly even LeBron James.
If this were any other team, this would be an utterly presumptuous move to make, but it’s something that the Lakers can do given their winning tradition, gigantic fanbase and their history of attracting talent. In other words, star players come to the Lakers with an expectation of winning championships because the Lakers are the team where star players have won championships. In the NBA, success begets success and no team exploits that concept more than the Lakers. For that reason, it’s hard to imagine that the Clippers, with their ugly history of bad luck and worse basketball, will ever be able to truly make LA their town.


Life comes at you fast, as the Mill can attest. It seems like only yesterday that the summer transfer window was slammed shut, Adrien Silva left pawing at the glass like a flustered commuter. Back then, Raheem Sterling spent deadline day as a reluctant makeweight in the Alexis Sánchez saga. Now, he’s stalling on a new Manchester City contract until the summer, with Real Madrid lurking ominously.
With an eight-point gap to Barcelona and a pitiful seven trophies in the last two seasons, Real Madrid will spend big in January, or else. Eden Hazard remains perpetually on their radar, but he has company among the Chelsea ranks in goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois. More realistic, if less catchy, names on Zinedine Zidane’s wishlist include Real Sociedad’s Alvaro Odriozola and Athletic Bilbao goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga.
One man who won’t be off to the Bernabéu any time soon is Neymar – according to his former Barça team-mate, Luis Suárez. “I know what Neymar is like and the admiration he had for Barcelona. I don’t see him now going to play for Real Madrid,” Suárez told Marca in an interview that will surely age like a fine wine. Barcelona are still searching for that missing Brazilian magic, and want to hurry along moves for Gremio midfielder Arthur Melo and Palmeiras defender Yerry Mina.
Spurs have gone a bit Spursy of late, and Mauricio Pochettino wants to shore up his side’s midfield with the addition of Valencia’s Geoffrey Kondogbia. The bad news: he’ll have to wait until next summer, with the Spanish side thought to have first refusal on the Internazionale loanee. Pochettino will at least have some cash to spare after selling Danny Rose to Manchester United, who are also keen on snaffling Leon Goretzka from Schalke on a pre-contract agreement.
The next couple of months could be tough for Rafa Benítez, with Newcastle skidding down the table and the status of any takeover deal as clear as a glass of egg nog. The Spaniard’s shopping list has an optimistic look, with Porto goalkeeper Iker Casillas pencilled in at the top. Turkish hot-shot Cenk Tosun has been hurriedly crossed off, after Besiktas vice-president Deniz Atalay valued the striker, who is also wanted by Crystal Palace, at a cool £88m.
“The press expect me to sign a [Ousmane] Dembélé in each transfer window. I’m being put on an incredibly high pedestal.” Transfer supremo Sven Mislintat isn’t loving life at Arsenal, but has at least figured out that Theo Walcott isn’t much cop. The winger is to be sent back to Southampton, or over to West Ham, post haste. David Moyes is also keen on Russia striker Fyodor Smolov, who is primed to score the World Cup’s opening goal before quietly slipping into obscurity.
Finally, not one but two done deals – Giuseppe Rossi has signed for Genoa, while former Liverpool and Juventus player Momo Sissoko has joined Atlético San Luis in the Mexican second division. The Mill spoils you, it really does.


The men in Alan Duarte’s family do not die from natural causes. Gun violence in the favela complex of Alemão, Rio de Janeiro, has claimed the lives of 10 close male relatives. After the death of his brother, Jackson, Duarte decided to fight back.
With a few borrowed gloves and castoff punchbags, in 2014 Duarte set up the boxing academy Abraço Campeão (Embracing Champions) to help children and young people develop their potential as well as the skills to forge a better future, despite growing up in a community blighted by armed conflict and decades of state neglect.
“Boxing teaches them how to create a new identity and see the possibilities of their lives differently,” says Duarte, 29, whose project is aimed at 10- to 29-year-olds, the group most at risk of being drawn into the drugs trade or getting caught in regular shootouts between gangs and military police. “They learn values like loyalty, friendship and resilience, and they discover their own potential.”
Situated in northern Rio, Alemão’s official population is around 70,000, though the true number is believed to be much higher. The high levels of violence there are well-documented, but less reported is the social exclusion and stigma young people face because they live in an area long regarded as a stronghold of the drugs trade.
“Children in our community are so used to hearing ‘No’. No, you can’t have that. No, you can’t go there. With the project, we say, ‘Yes, you can box with us’,” says Duarte, whose work as a coach for another boxing non-profit organisation, Luta Pela Paz  (Fight for Peace), in the favela complex of Maré, led him to set up the project in Alemão. “Our young people have so much energy and talent. All they lack is the chance to show it.”
Now the story of Duarte’s fight to forge a better future for his community is the subject of a 16-minute documentary entitled The Good Fight that has been grabbing attention at film festivals worldwide, winning a string of awards including the 2017 best documentary short prize at the prestigious Tribeca festival in New York.
For British filmmakers Ben Holman and Neirin Jones, what began as a favour to promote a friend’s non-profit organisation has evolved into an international success that has attracted a small army of supporters dedicated to helping Duarte expand his project. Filming over six months, the two-man crew encountered frequent interruptions because of downpours and sporadic shootouts. “Though what we faced to make the film is nothing compared to what the residents face on a daily basis,” says Jones.
The film, which is currently on the festival circuit, opens by highlighting the lack of proper sanitation or housing in Alemão. It captures an air of menace on the streets but also joy, camaraderie and solidarity as boys and girls learn to fight and receive guidance from volunteer staff. In one scene Duarte’s mother explains that at first she did not want him to box because she feared he would get hurt. In another, young children abandon a training session to seek cover as gunshots ring out.
Boxing is an ideal sport for a community that has high levels of violence, says Duarte, who was in London for screenings of The Good Fight. “We are all born with a certain energy which we need to find a way to release. If you can put that energy and drive into boxing, you will be much less likely to take up a weapon.”
In the boxing ring, he says, the project has created a space where children and adults can support each other to take positive steps towards education and employment. Some of the boxers have had success in amateur championships. Others in the community contribute in whatever way they can, whether by making repairs or bringing food. Sometimes it falls to staff, who act as social workers as well as coaches, to comfort children who lose a family member.
Since the film was made, Duarte himself has lost another relative – his 12-year-old cousin, who was an erratic attender at the academy. The tragedy convinced him of the need to reach more young people, and he plans to open two more branches elsewhere in Alemão. Currently, around 100 children take part in training and informal education sessions, with eight regular volunteers.
Brazil’s first boxing gold for Robson Conceição at last year’s Rio Olympics has inspired parents to encourage their children to take up the sport, including local gang members, he said. “Some of them say to their kids, ‘Get off the street and go and box’, because they don’t want them to have the same fate as theirs.”
Since the Games, the economic climate in Rio has grown tougher and the security situation has deteriorated sharply, but Duarte is still optimistic. “After we made the film, I started thinking about my life and all the friends and family in our community who lost their lives in the violence … I counted up to 90 who are dead or in prison. I realised that I was saved by boxing and now I want to do the same for others.”


Australia will decide on a successor for Socceroos coach Ange Postecoglou by mid-February, with former England boss Sven-Göran Eriksson emerging as a surprise candidate.
Football Federation Australia said on Tuesday it had formed a nine-person panel and engaged a consulting firm to assess candidates to take Australia to the World Cup in Russia and beyond.
Postecoglou announced his resignation last week after four years in the role, having recently secured Australia’s qualification to a fourth successive World Cup. 
FFA chief executive David Gallop said last week that the governing body’s preference was for another Australian coach but on Tuesday said they were keeping their options open. 
“As things stand, no-one is ruled in or out,” he said. “We are open minded about whether the coach is Australian or someone from overseas but they must live in Australia, embrace the progress on and off the field that has been achieved with national teams over the past four years... and be prepared to be an ambassador for our sport here and abroad. 
“FFA’s starting point is to appoint a coach for the long term but we will be advised on this and other matters by our expert panel.” 
A number of high-profile international coaches have been linked with the role but Eriksson became the first to declare his interest publicly, according to a News Corp report on Tuesday. 
“Yes of course I’m interested. It’s a big job, a big football country, you’re playing in the World Cup – again. You more or less always play in the World Cup,” the Swede was quoted as saying. 
Slavoljub Muslin, who was axed after successfully guiding Serbia through Russia qualifying, was also reported to be a candidate last week, with Graham Arnold and Tony Popovic seen as the strongest local contenders. 


The Pittsburgh Steelers edged their AFC North rivals the Cincinnati Bengals 23-20 on Monday night but the game was overshadowed by ugly moments of violence that did little to lessen the NFL’s reputation for brutality.
The most worrying moment came when Steelers linebacker Ryan Shazier was taken to a hospital for an MRI and a CT scan after he injured his back and was carted off the field early in the game. Shazier tackled receiver Josh Malone, fell to the ground and grabbed his back. The 25-year-old was strapped to a backboard and taken off. He was moving his arms on the field but his legs appeared immobile.
Steelers general manager Kevin Colbert said Shazier would not require surgery at this time in a statement released by the team, adding that he would stay in the hospital overnight and continue evaluations with “hopes of returning to Pittsburgh on Tuesday”.
Both teams were subdued for the rest of the half after Shazier’s injury but passions were reignited when Steelers receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster leveled Vontaze Burfict with an illegal hit. Smith-Schuster then stood over the prone Burfict taunting him. It was an unseemly episode on a night when Smith-Schuster’s team-mate Shazier appeared to have suffered a serious injury. Burfict was carted off the field with a head injury after being treated on the field for a few minutes but reports later indicated he had not been seriously hurt, Smith-Schuster was suspended for one game on Tuesday for his actions.
Bengals running back Joe Mixon also received treatment on the field while the Steelers receiver Antonio Brown received a heavy blow to the head while catching the touchdown that tied the game at 20-20.
The former Dallas Cowboys quarterback Troy Aikman tweeted: “This game is hard to watch for a number of reasons. Terrible for the NFL and the game of football overall.”
The Steelers-Bengals rivalry is one of the most hotly contested in the NFL, and has contained a particular edge in recent years. In an infamous playoff game in the 2015 season, Burfict concussed Brown after a brutal hit. Burfict was suspended three games for his actions.
The Bengals had led Monday’s game 17-0 at one point but allowed the Steelers back into the game, partly due to gifting Pittsburgh a team record 173 penalty yards.
Earlier on Monday, one of the NFL’s biggest stars, Rob Gronkowski, was suspended one game for a late and illegal hit on an opponent who was lying on the ground.


The US Soccer president, Sunil Gulati, will not seek a fourth term, announcing his decision two months after USA failed to qualify for next year’s World Cup.
“I spent a lot of time thinking about it and talking about it with people in many different positions – many of whom told me I should run,” Gulati told ESPN on Monday. “But in the end, I think the best thing for me personally, and for the federation, is to see someone new in the job.”
Former national team players Paul Caligiuri, Eric Wynalda and Kyle Martino are among the candidates to replace Gulati in February. USSF vice president Carlos Cordeiro also is running, as are Boston lawyer Steve Gans, New York lawyer Michael Winograd and Paul LaPointe, Northeast Conference manager of the United Premier Soccer League. Kathy Carter, president of MLS’s marketing subsidiary Soccer United Marketing, is considering a bid.
“This is the right move,” said Martino on Monday. “It’s an indication that Sunil has recognized a need for change, and he can now focus on the 2026 World Cup bid, which is critical for the growth of the game in the US.”
The 58-year-old Gulati has been a driving force in the USSF for more than 30 years. He helped put together the successful bid that brought the 1994 World Cup to the US and worked on the logistics of the tournament itself. He also was deputy commissioner of Major League Soccer from its launch until 1999.
However, he attracted criticism as the US’s bid to qualify for next year’s World Cup ended with a tame defeat to Trinidad & Tobago. The tournament in Russia will be the first time the US has missed a World Cup since 1986.
“The loss to Trinidad was painful, regrettable and led to a lot of strong emotions,” he said on Monday. “And to be honest, I think at this point, that’s overshadowed a lot of other things that are important. So fair or not, I accept that and think it’s time for a new person.”
Gulati was a unanimous pick in March 2006 to succeed Bob Contiguglia, who served two terms. Gulati replaced Chuck Blazer on Fifa’s executive committee in 2013 and continues to serve on the renamed Fifa council. He also is chairman of the joint US-Mexico-Canada bid committee hoping Fifa will pick North America to host the 2026 World Cup.


The Guardian enjoyed a successful evening at the Football Supporters’ Federation (FSF) awards in London, winning Newspaper of the Year for the fifth time in succession.
Football Weekly picked up the prize for Podcast of the Year, while regular Guardian contributor Jonathan Wilson was named Writer of the Year at the ceremony held at the Tower of London.
“15-20 years ago we decided to expand our sports coverage to areas that others weren’t,” said the Guardian’s head of sport, Owen Gibson. “We can write about any of the important issues we want, without pressure just to cover the top six.”
Other FSF awards went to Manchester City’s Jill Scott and Tottenham’s Harry Kane, who were named women’s and men’s player of the year.
“I want to say a big thank you to the Football Supporters’ Federation – it’s something I’m extremely proud to receive,” Kane said. “To have the support of fans from all across the country is mind-blowing really.”
John Motson received a lifetime achievement award, while Martin Tyler and Gary Neville won prizes for commentator and pundit of the year respectively.
Matchday awards went to Swansea City, for Away Day of the Year, Wigan supporter liaison officers Jason Taylor and Ian Wadsworth, and Blues 4 All, who won the Fans for Diversity Award.


Kevin De Bruyne has said he wishes Paul Pogba were available for Sunday’s Manchester derby because he relishes coming up against the best players.
Pogba will be starting a three-match ban after his red card in Manchester United’s 3-1 win at Arsenal for a challenge on Héctor Bellerín. Pogba said last week that he hoped Manchester City players would suffer injuries to help United’s title push but De Bruyne rejected the idea that karma was at work.
“I don’t believe in that,” the City player said. “I’m a very straightforward guy. If someone believes it is karma then OK. Everyone has their right to their opinion. I don’t want anyone to get injured. It’s a competition, you want to play against the best teams and the best players.
“I don’t care [what he says]. He can say whatever he wants. We just have to be focused on whatever we’re doing. He’s a massive player. I know him a little bit. He’s unbelievable. He took a red card and that’s the way it goes – you have injuries and suspensions.”
If City win at Old Trafford they will move 11 points clear at the top. De Bruyne said: “It means we [would] almost have a four-game advantage. It’s a good gap but doesn’t mean anything. Football goes very quick. It’s a busy two months when things can change but the way we’re going is good and we need to continue that.
“United are one of the biggest clubs in the country. They’re a massive team, they want to win the title. They spent a lot of money, like a lot of the big teams. They will be up for it and we will be up for it. Hopefully it’ll be a good game. We’ll play the same there. We never change. We try to do the things that we are good at. That gives us the best chance to win.”
De Bruyne is not travelling to Kharkiv for Wednesday night’s final Champions League group game against Shakhtar Donestk because he is suspended.
There is nothing riding on the game for City, who are through as group winners. “Maybe [it is] good for me to get a little bit of rest and prepare myself for Sunday,” De Bruyne said.
Pep Guardiola has been reminded of his responsibilities by the Football Association but will face no action for his animated exchange with Nathan Redmond at the end of Manchester City’s 2-1 victory over Southampton on Wednesday.
The FA asked the City manager for his observations regarding the incident which occurred after the final whistle at the Etihad Stadium. Guardiola, who had just seen Raheem Sterling score a 96th-minute winner, approached Redmond to remonstrate with him in what appeared a vehement manner.
Although Redmond issued a statement to make it clear he had no issue with Guardiola, the FA wrote to Guardiola to request clarification. On Friday Guardiola admitted: “I can’t control myself” but said he hoped to improve, and the FA has accepted his explanation while making him aware as to his future conduct.


Seven weeks ago James DeGale finally got the all-clear to do what he does best: curl his right hand into a fist and, for the first time since January, unleash it in anger. But watching the IBF world super-middleweight champion swarm round his trainer Jim McDonnell, snapping tigerishly at his pads, you would never know anything was awry.
His jab is sharp and peppery. Combinations flow with a pleasant viciousness. And the only sign of career-saving surgery is a thick scar along his right shoulder.
DeGale knew something drastic needed to be done after being forced to fight one-handed in a brutal draw against the American Badou Jack at the start of the year, during which a bridge on his upper teeth was smashed and he was put down in the 12th round.
The road back has been tinged with too much pain and boredom but, as he prepares to face the unheralded Caleb Truax on Saturday, he insists he is a new man.
“Against Jack my shoulder was totally gone,” says DeGale. “When I went to see the surgeon afterwards I had a 180 degree tear around the shoulder, my AC joint needed stabilising and my rotator cuff was torn. They went in keyhole, slit me open and found my shoulder was mashed.”
After surgery there was months of rehabilitation, during which time DeGale feared that he would never box again. “Yeah, I was doubting myself,” he says. “Only after about three months did it start getting better. I couldn’t lift my arm at first, or button a shirt up.
“I have actually only been punching for the past seven weeks, which is crazy. But now you will see what I can do, I promise. I’ll be jabbing, double jabbing and hooking off the jab.”
However, the injury did have its compensations. “Actually, the girl I was seeing was washing me, it was brilliant,” he says, beaming broadly. “I’ve got a stand-up shower and she’d get in and wash me. I think I milked it for a little bit.”
Even if there is some rust in the shoulder DeGale should have few problems beating Truax, who has a superficially impressive 30-3 record but has lost on every venture into world level.
DeGale then intends to unify the belts by beating the WBA champion David Benavidez in March or April before targeting a rematch with his bitter rival George Groves, who remains the only man to defeat him as a professional in a controversial points decision in 2011.
“I heard an interview with him the other day and he said he’s the No1 in the world,” says DeGale, sounding flabbergasted. “How does he justify that? Who has he boxed? I beat Andre Dirrell for my world title, he was 24-1 with his only loss against Carl Froch. Then I went to Canada and beat Lucian Bute who was a five-year world champion, then I mash up Rogelio Medina who was my mandatory, then I unified with Jack.”
Any meeting will first need Groves, the WBC champion, to beat Chris Eubank Jr when the pair meet in their Super Series semi-final fight in February and probably Callum Smith in the final. But DeGale thinks it is possible. “I’d like Groves to come through it because I want to fight him again and we could do it with our belts on the line,” he says. “Our history goes back a long way and it would be a fantastic fight.”
Yet DeGale admits that he does not like the fame that comes with success. “Believe it or not, I don’t,” he says. “I like nice things, I love money really, don’t I? But I don’t love the fame side. All I care about is my world title, being in big fights and being known for that.”
“I get asked to go on all sorts of TV shows and I have turned down so much shit. There were talks about going into the jungle, Strictly and Big Brother – and I’m a good dancer so I’d smash Strictly.”
For now, at least, smashing opponents remains his first priority. A point he intends to emphasise on Saturday night.


The Crystal Palace chairman, Steve Parish, has said funds for next month’s transfer window are ring-fenced and will not be affected by the club’s determination to pursue an ambitious £100m redevelopment of Selhurst Park’s main stand.
Palace, 18th in the Premier League after the worst-ever start to a top-flight campaign and no away goal in the division since April, have unveiled eye-catching plans for the redevelopment of their home of more than 93 years which would increase the capacity from 26,300 to 34,000. The original main stand would be rebuilt as a glass-fronted, 13,500-seat stand with the design, drawn up by KSS, who oversaw Liverpool’s revamp of Anfield, to be submitted for planning permission to Croydon council next month.
The club intend to lean on their major shareholders – Parish and the American businessmen Josh Harris and David Blitzer – and will explore debentures and advance season-ticket sales to fund the two-year build, which they would hope to complete by the start of the 2020-21 season. Yet Palace still intend to flex their muscles in next month’s transfer window, when Roy Hodgson hopes to recruit a goalkeeper, striker and, potentially, another attacking midfielder.
“That transfer budget is ring-fenced,” said Parish. “If you look at the 14 clubs below the top six, pretty much everyone is spending – apart from the promoted clubs, where you almost can’t spend it all. You’ve pretty much got to spend everything on the playing side or you run an even bigger risk of relegation. It’s impossible not to spend almost all your turnover on the playing side if you want to compete. Sometimes you’re smarter and get a good player for less, but other times you have to pay. It’s the nature of the beast, really.”
Dialogue began with the council’s planning department last month and is ongoing with Sainsbury’s, whose store adjoins the ground, with Palace seeking “a tiny sliver of land” from the supermarket. “I can’t imagine for a minute that Sainsbury’s want to be the people who hold up the development of a new iconic venue for south London,” said Parish, who admitted residents would need to be appeased. “We’ve deliberately chosen something with the minimal potential roadblocks, and Croydon council have been outstanding so far. We’ve put them under pressure, time-wise, and they’ve responded brilliantly. I’m sure they’re not going to want to drop this. I’m sure they’re going to want to be sensible.
“For the long-term future of this football club, it’s essential we improve this facility here. There might be some things that are easier to do in the Championship, with the number of spectators coming in not being as high, albeit the financing would be more difficult. But, as a club, we’ve got to get past relegation being the be-all and end-all. People think we’ve stalled, asking: ‘What are we here to do? Avoid relegation every year?’ That’s our reality at the moment, and we can’t run away from the mistakes that have got us into this position, but that’s on-the-pitch stuff. This is the long-term future of the club. It’s got to happen.” The plans would also have to be approved by the regional planning authority at the mayor of London’s office.
Palace will benefit from around £2m in compensation due after their former manager, Sam Allardyce, joined Everton last week, with the Merseyside club also hoping to prise the goalkeeping coach, Martyn Margetson, away from Selhurst Park. “Sam did a great job for us, he was 100% honest for me the entire time he worked for the club,” added Parish. “I was asked by Everton what I thought and I said he was a brilliant manager to work with.
“He feels a bit better about life and this is a different kind of challenge with the ownership they’ve got. We all know the kind of money they are going to be prepared to spend. I don’t begrudge him it. I like the people at Everton and wish him every success. I wish they weren’t trying to nick our goalkeeping coach but other than that, I like them.”


Antonio Conte was in bullish mood before Chelsea’s final Champions League group fixture, telling opponents Atlético Madrid: “You may be in good form, but so are we.”
Atlético have reached the Champions League final twice in the past three seasons and are unbeaten domestically, but even victory might not be enough to see them qualify for this year’s knockout stages. Chelsea beat Atlético 2-1 at the Wanda Metropolitano in September and Conte warned his rival that “playing the Europa League can happen”.
“I think Madrid is always a strong team and now I think they are in a good moment of form but is the same for us for sure,” Conte said. “The game will be open because Atlético Madrid will try to win, but it will be the same for us. The only difference is that the final result for them is too important. We are already qualified.”
Antoine Griezmann has returned to form, scoring four goals in the past three matches. Next month he will be joined in attack by Diego Costa, who left Chelsea in acrimonious circumstances last summer and did not travel with the Atlético squad for this match. But Conte rejected the suggestion any player was more important than another.
“I think we must have great respect for Atlético Madrid, the whole team, they are one of the best teams in Spain”, he said. “Three games ago there was a problem with Griezmann, because he didn’t score. Now he is scoring but Griezmann is a top player. He plays in a great team. If, after tomorrow’s game, they have to play in the Europa League, it can happen. But we must have great respect for the whole team, first of all for his coach.”
Another player who has felt the wrath of Conte was David Luiz and he will not feature in the match after sitting out training. Conte insisted this was down solely to a knee injury suffered by the Brazilian. When asked if there was any enduring problem between the pair, Conte was brusque. “That was two weeks ago, that was the past.” There may soon be a resolution to one off-the-pitch issue for Chelsea, the identity of the club’s next technical director.
Michael Emenalo, who had occupied the position for a decade, left Stamford Bridge last month and reports suggest the role may now be offered to Leonid Slutsky, who was relieved of his duties as Hull City manager on Sunday.
Slutsky has a long-standing relationship with his fellow Russian Roman Abramovich and the pair are expected to meet this week to discuss opportunities, though the 46-year-old replacing Emenalo is not guaranteed. Slutsky himself is believed to be considering taking a break from football, while Chelsea may yet split the role between more than one candidate.
Emenalo, meanwhile, has spoken about his time at Chelsea and asserted his admiration for Conte. A dispute between the pair over last summer’s transfer activity was believed to have contributed to the 52-year-old’s departure in November but both men have spoken warmly of each other since.
Claiming Conte was one of “the best three coaches in the world”, Emenalo, who is now technical director of Monaco, insisted Conte enjoyed the full support of Abramovich. “He enjoys a lot of respect at the senior level, the board level and the ownership level of the club,” he told TalkSport, “so there should be no worries at all.”


Wolverhampton Wanderers stretched their lead at the top of the Championship to four points but, more significantly, to 10 points from third place as they proved they know how to win ugly. Léo Bonatini’s early goal proved sufficient for a sixth successive victory to cement their mantle as title favourites.
After the aesthetically pleasing thrashings of Leeds United and Bolton Wanderers at Molineux recently, Wolves had to dig a little deeper to see off Steve Cotterill’s side, who stay in the relegation zone after Bonatini’s goal was awarded on goalline technology. The dismissal of Harlee Dean, for a second yellow card, seven minutes from time helped give Wolves the advantage to see them over the line.
Bonatini’s eighth-minute volley was so narrowly over the line before Michael Morrison cleared that there was a delay before the gadget on Simon Hooper’s wrist bleeped to indicate Wolves had taken the lead.
But Birmingham should take great heart from their second-half showing, in which they edged possession even if their absence of a goal threat remains a concern. They have now scored only three goals from the nine games since Cotterill succeeded Harry Redknapp.
“We’re not full of goals whereas they’ve got a front three who are full of goals,” the Birmingham manager said. “But I’ve seen them tear teams apart this season and they didn’t do that to us. I think they were average tonight, Wolves. If we’d got the first goal, it might have been different.”
Wolves have been scoring goals for fun and are on course to break the points record for the Championship. But they will be relieved to have survived this attritional West Midlands derby, in which their desire to head crosses clear and get a foot in was as important as the flowing football they displayed in the first half.
The orange flares were soon ignited from visiting supporters – old gold were not available – in the Railway End as Wolves extinguished Birmingham’s early bluster with the goal to confirm their superiority. David Stockdale, the Birmingham keeper, had already saved superbly from Ivan Cavaleiro in the same move and, on the rebound, even more impressively, from Diogo Jota before Bonatini’s volley was confirmed a goal.
It has been suggested that Wolves may succumb to a good physical prodding and Marc Roberts was fortunate that he had not already been cautioned for felling Jota when he took the same man out again to receive his yellow card.
The game became more even for the rest of the half even if Wolves, lacking the composure of the suspended Rúben Neves in midfield, were allowed to break down the wings with remarkable ease at times.
Birmingham did not raise the temperature until the second half, when they got forward more promptly having stiffened up the midfield. Wolves might have scored again, Jota and Hélder Costa sprinting through without managing to get a shot away, before the game started to boil over in a series of unseemly clashes.
Alfred N’Diaye, deputising for Neves, moved his head towards Maikel Kieftenbeld’s and then slapped Stephen Gleeson. To Wolves’ relief, the sanction was merely a caution apiece. But Birmingham were pressing at this stage, and belief started to echo around St Andrew’s until Jota and Morrison tangled and Dean was dismissed for his shove on the Portuguese forward.
“It was very weak, for Harlee Dean getting sent off,” Cotterill said. “He’s just moving Jota out the way so I’m not sure he should fall to the floor like that.
“If he’s gone to the floor for that, then what about Kieftenbeld? That was a straight red for me – not another yellow. If Stephen Gleeson had gone to the floor, then you probably get a red card. But he’s stayed on his feet, he’s been honest.”
The Wolves head coach, Nuno Espírito Santo, said: “We deserved the win and we deserved the clean sheet because we defended very well. I’m not against being aggressive as long as it is fair. But the referee refereed the game very well.”


In rugby the scoreboard does not always tell the whole story. When Richmond beat Doncaster Knights 26-22 in the Championship last month, that was particularly true. The Yorkshire side are fully professional, the part-time Londoners train together only on Tuesday and Thursday nights. To date, the Knights have collected four league wins this season to Richmond’s six.
One intrigued observer at last month’s game was Sam Edgerley, a Doncaster professional himself as recently as last season. Previously a member of the England Sevens squad who also once shared London Irish academy lodgings with Jonathan Joseph and Marland Yarde, Edgerley is now studying modern languages at Oxford University and starts at full-back for the Dark Blues in Thursday’s Varsity Match at Twickenham. Next year he is poised to start work in the City and join the part-time brigade permanently.
Which brings us to the fascinating bit: Edgerley firmly believes playing part-time can produce better, more fulfilled rugby players than if they were full-time pros. Yes, the 26-year-old’s spare time now consists of micro-seconds but he feels totally liberated. “When you’re playing professional rugby and that’s all you’re doing you can become very narrow-minded,” he says. “You focus on the smallest details and, for me, it became all-consuming. I’d be very self-critical of my performances.” And now, amid all the competing demands of his “other” life? Totally different. “It allows you to express yourself on the field and not be too afraid. There’s a big difference when you’re playing just for a badge, rather than when there’s a contract on the line.
“It’s been really refreshing just to play for my mates and play for a cause … to have a balance in your life rather than just a sole focus on rugby. The intensity of the academic side at Oxford is a big difference and a shock to the system but at the same time it is unbelievably rewarding. You’re having to work every waking minute and rugby becomes your release.”
Richmond’s director of rugby, Steve Hill, reckons Edgerley, once dubbed “the next Jason Robinson” by an excited schoolboy coach, is by no means alone. Hill has to deal with problems encountered by none of his Premiership counterparts. For example, he says: “Last week someone walked on to the railway line at Barnes; I have between 75 and 80 players training on Tuesday and Thursday nights and 25 were late, including a third of the first team,” but believes less can often be more. “My experience of the ex-pro guys who have come to Richmond is that it really did refresh their love of the game. If you’re a full-time sportsman, your life ultimately revolves around how well you’re going and whether the team is winning. So much of that is out of your control.”
He cites another case study: his lock forward Chris Davies has just chalked up his 200th game for the club while holding down a senior executive role at Merrill Lynch. While Hill has to cut him some occasional slack – “he phones me on Monday and says: ‘Steve, we’ve all been called to a meeting in Milan, I’m not going to make training’” – his team-mates are fully supportive. “My guys have got a different balance to their lives,” continues Hill. “If they have a crap day at the office they can come down on Tuesday and Thursday nights and smack tackle shields all over the place.”
Ex-pros have come to Richmond and it has refreshed their love of the game
Which begs the current burning question: would all Championship sides be better off going semi-pro? Not just financially – no one makes any money in the Championship – but on all fronts? Several sides have been asking that question this season, with Bristol virtually guaranteed promotion before a ball was kicked and the old ring-fencing debate back up and running.
“Bedford have got more non-full-time players this year than they’ve ever had and are having their best season for four or five years,” says Hill. “None of our players are full-time and one-third of London Scottish’s squad this season are not full-time either. I’m sure other clubs may begin to look at that.”
Clearly there are greater job opportunities in London than some other areas of the country but Edgerley fully concurs with Hill: “When teams like Scottish and Richmond are doing it, it’ll be potentially hard for others not to follow suit. When I went down to watch Doncaster at Richmond, it was really difficult for them. As a full-time side there is a pressure to take sides like that to the cleaners. It can be difficult to come up short against a team you know are training two nights a week when, for you, it’s been your sole focus all week.
“To see guys who have been working in the City all week come together and take down a full-time professional outfit – guys who have been training full-time, turning up in their compression leggings with their protein shakes – was incredible. I think it’s an advert for the fact it is possible to do other things that give you a perspective and a critical distance from rugby.” Indeed. No one is proposing a part-time Premiership but money, it seems, does not automatically buy oval-ball fulfilment.
Perhaps the most successful footballing son of a rugby-playing father was Ryan Giggs, whose dad Danny Wilson played rugby union for Cardiff and rugby league for Swinton and Wales. The other way around is rarer, although Liam Botham, son of Ian (Scunthorpe United), did enjoy a successful spell in union for Cardiff. The latest wannabe is Jack Ramsay, son of the leading chef Gordon Ramsay who had trials for Glasgow Rangers in a previous life. Ramsay jnr, a flanker, is due to feature in the Champions’ Trophy U18 schools final at Saracens’ Allianz Park on Wednesday afternoon for Dulwich College against Blundell’s. Good luck to all involved.
The return of Champions Cup rugby this weekend will come as a slight relief to defending European champions Saracens, who have contrived to lose their last five games in all competitions. They entertain Clermont Auvergne, currently in eighth place in the Top 14 having failed to beat the league’s bottom side Oyonnax in their last away fixture. Both sides will be keen to put their respective seasons back on track.


Malcolm Jenkins, the Philadelphia Eagles safety and face of the Players Coalition, said this week that he would end his practice of raising his right fist during the playing of the star-spangled banner, after the NFL agreed to provide $89m to programs promoting the goals the coalition wants to achieve.
While there is so much to write about the details surrounding the deal struck between the Players Coalition and the NFL, I want to focus on Malcolm Jenkins and why I agree with his abandonment of raising his fist during the playing of the national anthem. To do so I’m going to, as he posted on Twitter, go back to “where we began” for him (and the Players Coalition) – his ride along with the Philadelphia police department.
While combing over the comments made by Jenkins in the article attached to his 30 November tweet, where he reminded followers about his entry point into fighting for social justice, Jenkins admits that “luckily” he had “very, very few interactions with officers” in his life.
This is an anomaly in the lives of many black people in America, and specifically in Philadelphia.
A recent study shows us that predominately black neighborhoods in Philadelphia drew 70% more frisks than non-black areas, yet yielded less contraband, and that the elevated rate of frisking was consistent regardless of whether the majority black neighborhood was a high-crime area or a very low-crime area.
Jenkins said: “There’s tons of people outside, but nobody wants to get involved. They don’t feel like the police are there to protect them, so they don’t give information. The officers are mad because they’re trying to clean up the streets … but there’s no cooperation. It was an eye-opening experience”.
Maybe, “the people” disproportionately policed in Philadelphia don’t feel like the officers are there to better their communities, not only because of rampant racially biased stop-and-frisk tactics.
Maybe many of those residents remember 13 May 1985, when the police dropped a bomb in a west Philadelphia neighborhood, leaving residents like Steve Harmon retelling the terror saying: “Drop a bomb on a residential area? I never in my life heard of that. It’s like Vietnam”.
No. It was not Vietnam. It was a black neighborhood in America. The bombs were dropped on the black liberation group Move, and any other non-Move affiliated children, women and men in the vicinity.
Move members were often photographed raising their black fist.
Conceivably, Jenkins was unaware of the historical significance of raising the black fist as a symbol of resistance, strength and solidarity in the face of oppression.
Jenkins rode with the police, partnered with wealthy billionaires, and is working with Congress – those are not black-fist raising actions
While raising a black fist will always be connected to the iconic image of athlete-activists Tommie Smith and John Carlos at the 1968 Olympics, it will also always be associated with the Black Panther party for self-defense (BPP) – a group that was seen by J Edgar Hoover as “without question … the greatest threat to internal security of the country” for providing impoverished youths with hot meals via their Free Children’s Breakfast Program.
We are also talking about the same Black Panther party that was known for exercising their second amendment rights, and taking up arms in defense against police brutality, as they would regularly show up during police encounters with members of the black community, stand at a legal distance, and surveil their interactions to ensure that nothing illegal would take place.
The Black Panthers (and others raising their black fist as a political symbol) did not do ride-alongs with the police – they policed the police, or rode in police cars involuntarily, because they were arrested.
I did not write this piece to frame Jenkins as “sell-out”. No, on the contrary, I thank him for no longer raising his fist as a sign of protest. The historical associations of that gesture with regards to black protest are not reflective of the politics he has displayed.
Because as Malcolm Jenkins has made apparent, his most “eye opening experiences” during the past two years have been participating in a ride along with the police, meeting with members of Congress in Washington DC and most recently striking an $89m partnering with the NFL owners.
I am not passing judgment, but clearly these moves are in no way aligned with individuals and groups like the Black Panther party, which argued that the economic and political roots of racism were tethered to (what they believed was) the exploitative nature of capitalist systems, and that the black struggle for liberation must be a revolutionary movement to overthrow the entire power structure in order to secure true freedom.
Jenkins rode with the police, partnered with wealthy billionaire, capitalist NFL owners, and is working with Congress – those are not black-fist raising actions. That’s why I am pleased to see Jenkins no longer raising his fist.


The NFL has suspended New England Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski one game for a late, gratuitous hit to the head of Buffalo defensive back Tre’Davious White.
White was lying face down on the sideline after intercepting a pass Sunday when the 265lbs Gronkowski body-slammed him, driving his forearm into White’s back and head. Gronkowski was called for unnecessary roughness, but because of retaliation from the Bills there was no penalty assessed. White was later evaluated for concussion, a particular concern given the issues around brain trauma suffered by NFL players.

“Your actions were not incidental, could have been avoided and placed the opposing player at risk of serious injury. The Competition Committee has clearly expressed its goal of ‘eliminating flagrant hits that have no place in our game.’ Those hits include the play you were involved in yesterday,” the NFL vice president of football operations, Jon Runyan, wrote a letter to Gronkowski confirming his suspension.
After the game, which New England won 23-3, Patriots coach Bill Belichick appeared to apologize to Bills counterpart Sean McDermott, calling the hit “bullshit”.

Gronkowski also apologized, saying he let his frustration get the better of him after being called for a number of penalties. “I’m not in the business of that,” he told reporters. “There was a lot of frustration. I just want to apologize to Tre’Davious White. I don’t believe in taking shots like that.”
Gronkowski will miss New England’s game against Miami next Monday night. It is understood he plans to appeal the suspension.
Gronkowski has been one of the most productive tight ends in NFL history despite injury problems that have allowed him to play all 16 games just twice in his first seven seasons. This year, he has caught 55 passes for 849 yards and seven touchdowns.
At 6ft 6in, he is bigger than the players trying to cover him, and he has increasingly complained that officials ignore interference by defenders because his size can make it seem inconsequential. Gronkowski caught nine passes for 147 yards against Buffalo on Sunday. On the play that resulted in a penalty, he said he felt he was pushed and held.
“I just don’t understand why there wasn’t a flag,” he said. “There was a couple of times in the game they’re calling me for the craziest stuff ever. It’s like crazy. Like what am I supposed to do? And then they don’t call that? It was just frustration.”


Liverpool and Everton will face each other in the FA Cup next month after the third-round draw was given a derby flavour.
The all-Merseyside fixture means the new Everton manager, Sam Allardyce, will visit Anfield for the second time in the space of a month, with the teams set to collide in the Premier League on Sunday afternoon. The sides last met in the competition in the 2012 semi-final, when Liverpool beat their neighbours 2-1 thanks to Andy Carroll’s late Wembley header.
Brighton & Hove Albion will also play host to their rivals, having been paired with Crystal Palace at the Amex Stadium. Last Tuesday’s Premier League fixture between the two was marred by crowd trouble. There will also be a north-east derby with Middlesbrough taking on their Championship rivals Sunderland, while Manchester City will welcome Burnley to the Etihad Stadium.
Non-league Hereford will welcome the 2016 Premier League champions Leicester City to Edgar Street provided they win their replay against Fleetwood Town.
The draw threw up the potential for upsets as West Ham United were handed a trip to the impressive League One side Shrewsbury Town while the Championship leaders Wolverhampton Wanderers will be licking their lips at the prospect of inflicting more pain on the ailing Swansea City at Molineux.
Manchester United were given what seems to be a comfortable home draw against the Championship side Derby County while Tottenham Hotspur face League One AFC Wimbledon at Wembley. The holders, Arsenal, will face what could be a testing encounter with Nottingham Forest at the City Ground.
The Hereford manager, Peter Beadle, said the prospect of facing Leicester at Edgar Street would give his Southern Premier League side all the motivation they need to see off Fleetwood. Beadle told BBC Sport: “Former Premier League champions coming to Edgar Street – we’ve got 90 minutes to get through but if we do, there’s the incentive. We’ve got three league games before that and they are our priority, but then we can relax and enjoy the replay.”
The National League side AFC Fylde will head to Bournemouth if they beat Wigan Athletic in a replay. All the ties will take place between 5 and 8 January.
Ipswich v Sheffield Utd; Watford v Bristol City; Birmingham v Burton; Liverpool v Everton; Brighton v Crystal Palace; Aston Villa v Woking or Peterborough; Bournemouth v Fylde or Wigan; Coventry v Stoke; Newport v Leeds; Bolton v Huddersfield; Port Vale or Yeovil v Bradford; Nottingham Forest v Arsenal; Brentford v Notts County; QPR v MK Dons; Manchester United v Derby; Forest Green or Exeter v West Brom; Doncaster v Slough Town or Rochdale; Tottenham v AFC Wimbledon; Middlesbrough v Sunderland; Fleetwood or Hereford v Leicester; Blackburn or Crewe v Hull; Cardiff v Mansfield; Manchester City v Burnley; Shrewsbury v West Ham; Wolves v Swansea; Stevenage v Reading; Newcastle v Luton; Millwall v Barnsley; Fulham v Southampton; Wycombe v Preston; Norwich v Chelsea; Gillingham or Carlisle v Sheffield Wednesday (Ties to be played 5-8 January)


Bristol City full-back Joe Bryan has earned praise from a local non-league side after agreeing to pay for physiotherapy sessions to help one of their players recover from a serious injury.
Nailsea & Tickenham FC thanked Bryan for his “amazing gesture” after he reached out to Chris Corner, who suffered a broken tibia and fibula in a match against Uphill Castle in November. The injury also left Corner, a self-employed builder, unable to work for several months.
Speaking to BBC Radio Bristol, Bryan said: “Scott Murray [Bristol City’s kit manager] tweeted about it I thought, he’s a fellow footballer and self-employed, with Christmas coming up.”
“One of our physios plays in the [Nailsea] team so I just said to him, ‘can you get him back fit and invoice everything to me?’ I’m in a position where I can do things like that, and help out where I can. I’ve been brought up like that.”
“We all dread any sort of serious injury like this,” Bryan added. “I’ve had a far less serious one and I know the psychological pain that you go through.”
Midfielder Corner confirmed that he had fractured his tibia and fibula while playing for the Somerset County Premier League side. He has had surgery to insert a metal rod in his leg and is wearing a protective boot. He told BBC Radio Bristol’s John Darvall he will be unable to work until March at the earliest.
“It was a fair tackle, nothing nasty about it,” Corner said. “I went in really hard and his foot has caught me under my shinpad and broken my tibia.”
Nailsea & Tickenham, who play in the 11th tier of English football, have also arranged a fundraising raffle for Corner with prizes donated by players from Bristol City and Bristol Rovers.
Bryan has been a first-team regular for the Robins as they have defied pre-season expectations in the Championship. The left-back, who was born in Bristol and came through the club’s youth academy, scored the opening goal as Bristol City beat Middlesbrough on Saturday to climb to third in the table.


Douvan, who has not seen a racecourse since losing his unbeaten record for Willie Mullins in the Queen Mother Champion Chase in March, heads the entries for what promises to be an outstanding renewal of the Tingle Creek Chase at Sandown Park on Saturday – if the course can fend off the freezing temperatures which are forecast for south-west London on Friday night.
Douvan set off as the 1-4 favourite for the Champion Chase on the back of a 13-race winning streak which included wins at the Festival meeting in both 2015 and 2016. He could finish only seventh of the 10 runners in March, however, after an uncharacteristically sloppy round of jumps, and was subsequently diagnosed with a stress fracture of the pelvis.
The race was ultimately won by Special Tiara, who held on by a neck to beat Colin Tizzard’s Fox Norton, the subsequent winner of two Grade One events. Both horses are still engaged in Saturday’s race, with Fox Norton, who reversed the Festival form when he finished eight lengths in front of Special Tiara in the Shloer Chase at Cheltenham in November, second-favourite in the ante-post betting at 5-2, behind Douvan at a top price of 5-6.
“The Tingle Creek has been the plan for Fox Norton since the end of last season,” Joe Tizzard, the son of the chaser’s trainer Colin, said on Monday. “We had a lovely run on his reappearance at Cheltenham, when he was mightily impressive. It will be interesting to see if Douvan comes over or not, but we are looking forward to the challenge. Bryan Cooper will be riding him again.”
Un De Sceaux, last year’s Tingle Creek winner and a stable companion of Douvan, is also a possible runner, but in recent days the betting has suggested that Douvan is more likely to line up with Un De Sceaux potentially heading to Sunday’s Hilly Way Chase in Ireland instead.
Paul Nicholls, who has won the Sandown race a record nine times with horses including Kauto Star and Master Minded, is also represented in the entries with Politologue, who took the Haldon Gold Cup at Exeter on his seasonal debut in November and is a 13-2 chance to follow up this weekend. “San Benedeto is more likely to go for the Peterborough Chase at Huntingdon on Sunday,” Nicholls said.
Sandown officials could lay frost covers as early as Wednesday in an attempt to defeat the cold snap that has been widely forecast for the end of the week, before removing and then relaying the covers on the first day of the Tingle Creek meeting on Friday.
“Every forecast you look at suggests the first three days this week are pretty innocuous,” Andrew Cooper, the clerk of the course at Sandown, said on Monday. “It will be wet and windy on Thursday, with perhaps as much as 10mm of rain, then that will clear east allowing cold air in from the north.
“The worst forecast for Friday night is for -3C, and then up to 5C during the day on Saturday. We’ll aim to get the covers down on Wednesday ahead of the rain and manage things from there.”
Willy Twiston-Davies, who has not ridden in public since injuring two vertebrae and two ribs in a fall on the opening day of the Cheltenham Festival in March, has retired from race-riding.
Twiston-Davies, whose brother Sam is stable jockey to Paul Nicholls, rode more than 200 winners on the Flat, including Primitivo in the King George V Handicap at Royal Ascot in 2016. He also took the Fox Hunters’ Chase over the Grand National fences at Aintree in 2011 as a 16-year-old amateur rider.
“In some ways it was a tough decision to make,” Twiston-Davies said, “and obviously I will miss it a lot, but at the same time I can see myself training one day, perhaps when dad [Nigel] calls it a day, and I’m also keen to concentrate on the bloodstock side of things.”

Paul Pogba will start against CSKA Moscow on Tuesday after Manchester United decided not to appeal against his red card at Arsenal. The France midfielder was dismissed at the Emirates Stadium on Saturday and is set to serve a three-game domestic ban.
It is understood United have not contested the dismissal and that the FA will not impose an additional punishment after Pogba appeared to respond to the red card with a sarcastic clap.
That means the midfielder will take the field in United’s final Champions League group game – where the possibility of equalling a club record of 40 successive home games without defeat is arguably the most important prize at stake.
United officially need a point to assure top spot and qualification but only an extreme contrivance of results and goal difference would see them miss out on the last 16. “He’s happy to play tomorrow. It’s the next match, the match that matters. He plays tomorrow,” said José Mourinho. “He’s very happy to play and try to keep his momentum because since he was back from his injury he’s been phenomenal.”
Zlatan Ibrahimovic, on the other hand, is being treated with kid gloves before Sunday’s top-of-the-table clash against Manchester City.
The Swede has made four substitute appearances since his earlier-than-expected return from knee ligament damage, but was absent from the squad when United defeated Arsenal on Saturday evening.
Mourinho confirmed it was a conditioning issue rather than a fresh injury which kept the striker out at the Emirates and he will give Ibrahimovic every chance of being ready to face Pep Guardiola’s Premier League leaders.
“Zlatan is not injured. He will be out again for tomorrow but I believe he will be back to normal work after CSKA,” said Mourinho.
“Zlatan needs some time of very hard work on the muscular area that supports the knee that had the problem. When the time for that hard work comes, the fatigue comes. To work really hard for a certain period of time, he cannot play these days. He is on his cycle of work divided between the gym and the pitch.”
Luke Shaw will return to the squad for the CSKA match. The England international has been restricted to just 48 minutes this season amid rumours he is on his way out of Old Trafford but could make a rare European outing on Tuesday.
“I have to think. I am going to make a few, but not too many, changes,” Mourinho added. “We didn’t qualify yet, we didn’t finish first in the group yet, there are other clubs also involved in qualification and I need to keep a certain balance in the team.
“But when we speak about Luke Shaw, he’s working to have an opportunity and sooner or later that opportunity will arrive because he deserves that opportunity. He is selected for tomorrow for sure – to start or be on the bench, I cannot answer.”
Nemanja Matic, Eric Bailly, Marouane Fellaini, Phil Jones and Michael Carrick will all miss the game against CSKA Moscow. “We have problems, we have injuries. [Nemanja] Matic is injured and when I say he is injured, he is injured,” said Mourinho.
There will definitely be a change in goal, with David de Gea rested in favour of Sergio Romero and Joel Pereira on the bench. De Gea is turning in another superb season for United but Mourinho offered a playful response when asked if he had seen a better goalkeeper this year.
“Yes. Romero,” he said. “Because he plays tomorrow. My goalkeeper is always the best goalkeeper in the world. Now David is third best. Romero is number one and Joel number two. David is third best.”


The supreme court on Monday suggested it may side with New Jersey in its effort to make sports gambling legal, a case that could make betting on football, basketball and other sports widely available.
The justices heard New Jersey’s challenge to a federal law that bars states from authorizing gambling in most professional and college sports. If the supreme court strikes down the law, giving sports betting the go-ahead, 32 states would likely make gambling on leagues such as the NFL and NBA legal within five years, according to a report by a California research firm.
The case pits New Jersey and other states against all four major US professional sports leagues, the NCAA and the federal government. The stakes are high. The American Gaming Association estimates that Americans illegally wager about $150bn on sports each year.
The NBA, NFL, NHL and MLB are arguing that striking down the law would hurt the integrity of their games, though leaders of all but the NFL have shown varying degrees of openness to legalized sports gambling.
More than a dozen states are supporting New Jersey, which argues that congress exceeded its authority when it passed a 1992 law that keeps states from authorizing sports betting. The state says the constitution allows congress to make wagering on sports illegal but that it can’t require states to keep sports gambling prohibitions in place. 
Justices Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor seemed to suggest that congress’ action was permissible. But other justices suggested that they would side with New Jersey. Justice Anthony Kennedy told Paul Clement, who was arguing for the sports leagues, that the law seemed like impermissible “commandeering,” or compelling the state to take an action. 
Other justices suggested an interest in avoiding striking down the federal law as unconstitutional even if they side with New Jersey. Justice Neil Gorsuch told Ted Olson, who was arguing for New Jersey, that the court normally interprets statutes in a way to avoid the constitutional question if it can. 
New Jersey’s governor, Chris Christie ,sat in the front row of the courtroom as the justices debated the case. His state has spent millions of dollars in legal fees trying to legalize sports betting. In 2012, with voters’ support, state lawmakers authorized betting on sports at the state’s casinos and racetracks. The action was a direct challenge to federal law. 
The law barring sports gambling makes exceptions for Nevada, Montana, Oregon and Delaware, states that had approved some form of sports wagering before the law took effect. Nevada is the only state where a person can wager on the results of a single game, though the law doesn’t cover wagering between friends. In passing the law, congress gave New Jersey a year-long window to authorize sports betting at its casinos, but the state didn’t act. 
Two decades later, when New Jersey decided to legalize sports betting, the four major professional sports leagues and the NCAA sued, but the state lost in court. In 2014, New Jersey tried a different tactic by repealing laws prohibiting sports gambling at casinos and racetracks. It lost again in court. 
A decision is expected by the end of June.


Ben McAdoo has been fired as head coach of the New York Giants, a season after leading them to the playoffs.
The 40-year-old seemed to have a bright future with the team after leading the Giants to an 11-5 record last season but they have struggled badly this time around, and are currently 2-10, tied for the second worst record in the entire NFL along with the San Francisco 49ers.
McAdoo’s firing comes as little surprise. Although there have been some mitigating circumstances – the team’s best player, Odell Beckham Jr, has been sidelined by injury – the Giants’ owner, John Mara, said last week that he was “embarrassed” by the team’s record this season. McAdoo had also attracted criticism after the Giants’ quarterback Eli Manning was benched after 210 straight starts. ESPN reports that Manning will return as starter for New York’s next game under interim coach Steve Spagnuolo.
There have also been discipline issues and reports of internal strife within the Giants: McAdoo suspended two players for violating team rules earlier in the season.
McAdoo himself appeared to be ready for Monday’s news. “I understand where the fans are coming from,” McAdoo said after Sunday’s loss to the Oakland Raiders. “If I was on the outside looking in, I’d feel the same way they feel.”
The Giants also fired general manager Jerry Reese on Monday. Reese had been the team’s GM since 2007 and they had won two Super Bowls during his time in New York.
McAdoo, who was the team’s offensive coordinator until he stepped up as head coach, had struggled to win over fans in the high-pressure sports environment of New York. His dress sense was widely mocked, while a 12-year-old McAdoo impersonator seemed more popular than the coach himself.


A surfer bobbing in the ocean can often cut a solitary figure but the sport at the professional level is far from the solo show it may sometimes seem. As Australian Tyler Wright returned to dry land at Honolua Bay with a second world title under her belt on Friday, she rightly took the individual plaudits – but it was the people working tirelessly to get to her this point who were on her mind.
Her individual brilliance over the course of the World Surf League season had just helped her defend her 2016 title, a reward for consistency in a tightly-contested campaign, but as she said in the initial moments after the quarter-final win over Brisa Hennessy that put paid to her challengers’ hopes, “it takes a team to do this”.
It’s a sentiment the 23-year-old would repeat to the Guardian a few hours later, once the initial euphoria of becoming the ninth woman to claim a second championship had died down. “I’ve been in the fortunate position to be able to work with incredible people that were able to see the potential in me and also know how much more there is,” she said. “They hold me to a higher standard than most others do.”
Glenn [Hall] is just a good human and a good family man. I value that in life a lot.
None more so than her coach, Glenn “Micro” Hall, who has been instrumental in her success since teaming up two years ago. The former professional surfer, who also mentors Matt Wilkinson on the men’s tour, understands what makes Wright tick, how to maximise her potential. With Wright’s raw talent and Hall’s holistic approach to coaching, it’s a match made in surfing heaven.
“First up, Glenn is just a good human and a good family man. I value that in life a lot,” Wright says of Hall. “He’s also a very good coach and has a great understanding of what it takes to bring out the best in an athlete and push them, but also have that athlete being happy and healthy and absolutely loving what they’re doing so they don’t burn out.
“I’m in a fortunate position to have someone like him. He’s not going to tell me that I have to want to win because if it’s not within me, I’m not going to want to win.
“He’s always been one who’s said, ‘I’m not going to ask for anything that you’re not going to be able to give’ ... He has an incredible understanding of everything. I respect him in a lot of ways.”
Wright, who hails from a strong surfing family on the south coast of New South Wales, won her first world tour event title at 14, but such early success did not convince her professional surfing was the path she should take. It was not until the arrival of Hall that she became convinced of her calling. The pair soon hatched a plan with the grand aim of winning a championship every year. “It came from six years of not knowing what I wanted to do and whether I wanted this career or not,” she says. It’s a plan they have so far managed to stick to.
I always saw myself having a short career until Glenn came along and showed me a different way to compete
Hall gets Wright. She doesn’t always want to be pushed, to be told what to do. For her, mental and physical wellbeing is of the utmost importance, and Hall’s approach to her management allows for this. The benefits are being reaped.
“Some days it is just easier to go take a nap,” she says. “But at the end of the day I like working hard, I like doing what I do and getting to work with people I work with. They want me in a happy and healthy mind state which is what they’ve been able to do.
“Finding that balance for a coach and for a team has been incredible. I always saw myself having a short career until Glenn came along and showed me a different way to compete.”
If Hall is more of a recent influence on Wright’s career, the support network provided by her close-knit family has been there since the beginning of her journey from Culburra Beach to global stardom. The relationship with her brothers has been well documented – particularly Owen, following the high-profile accident that derailed his own world title hopes two years ago – but it was her mother who was on hand in Hawaii last week to lend her support.
Fiona Wright wasn’t able to get to France last year to witness her daughter secure her first title – much to Tyler’s disappointment – and she had to make do with an emotional reunion at Sydney airport upon Tyler’s return home. This year, tickets were booked in January for Fiona, along with two of Tyler’s aunties and her uncle, to travel to Maui. There was no way she was going to miss the chance of seeing a second one.
The fruits of that family bond – with her immediate and extended family – has shaped the person Tyler is today. “It takes a group of people to raise someone, I’ve always thought that,” Wright says. “I come from a town where everyone has family and everyone plays a part in helping out. There are a few families who helped raise me and helped me become the person I am today. That grounding and foundation point in life is a beautiful thing and something that I appreciate as I get older.”
Last week’s victory meant Wright became the first woman since Stephanie Gilmore to win back-to-back world titles (Gilmore won four in a row between 2007 and 2010).
Wright shrugged off a knee injury sustained earlier in the season but was ousted at the weekend by Gilmore the eventual winner of the Maui Pro. It means she ended the season with just one event win – the Rio Pro in Brazil. After last season’s five victories, it’s a curious statistic, one which probably reflects the evenness of this year’s competition. It ultimately won’t be dwelled on for too long – the record will still read: Tyler Wright, 2017 world champion.
She moves closer to Carissa Moore – one of five women who arrived in Maui still harbouring world title hopes – who is on three title wins. Gilmore (another contender in Maui) is sitting on six and Layne Beachley heads the list with seven.
Wright says she doesn’t know if she will go on to match any of those women, but with last year’s experience helping her deal with the pressure of the final event this time around, it’s a fair assumption that she will be even better placed with another successful season under her belt to challenge for honours once again next year.
In the meantime, with the backing of her team and family, she plans to continue riding the wave of success. “I’m just going to keep doing what I’m doing,” she says. “I really like what I’m doing.”


At 36, Jacinta is playing competitive sport for the first time in her life. Well, almost the first. As a teenager she idolised the Brisbane Bullets, and asked to take up basketball. Driven along to tryouts, she was told that the uniform for girls was not shorts, but bloomers. Bloomers, like the underwear she wore under her skirt to school netball. She asked if she could wear shorts like the boys, but was told no. A chubby kid, she was embarrassed, and decided basketball wasn’t for her after all.
She’d never much followed sport after that, especially AFL football. She felt, as Anne Myers powerfully portrays in her prologue to the Women’s Footy Almanac, that footy constituted a “microcosm of patriarchy at its worst... a hyper-masculinised environment that fosters a distorted sense of entitlement and privilege among young men”. She knew the faces and the names, men who “behave badly”, and disrespect women, but are “rewarded with media contracts and pats on the back”. As a feminist, the stakes of following Australian rules football were too intense to bear.
But, as with Myers, and so many other women, things changed with the introduction of AFLW. For the first time, following AFL footy didn’t mean compromising her values. At last – visibly at least – there were women to idolise, people like Susan Alberti, or Moana Hope (featured on Australian Story on the eve of the inaugural women’s national league). Alberti, who wouldn’t take no from the AFL executive for an answer and propped up the women’s league of her own financial accord, or Hope, “heart and tatts on her sleeve, and a kick to match”. Women who inspired, with “determination, toughness, and a humility and gentleness of soul”.
The rest, as with season one of AFLW, is history. Today, Jacinta is one of 463,364 women playing some form of Australian rules football, after an explosion in the number of dedicated women’s teams “way beyond” the AFL’s own expectations. The number of women’s teams is now 1,690 nationally, a huge 76% increase on last year. Let that sink in: a 76% increase. On the back of these unprecedented numbers, women now account for 30% of the total participation numbers in the game, helping drive a 10% increase overall on participation figures in the sport for 2017.
These numbers are not just restricted to the traditional AFL footy heartland of Victoria, either. Almost a quarter of women playing are from Victoria (108,021) but there is significant uptake elsewhere – even in the traditionally rugby league-dominated expanses of Western Sydney. In NSW and the ACT, there was a 78% increase in women playing in registered club football competitions. When the GWS Giants’ success is inevitably questioned again, perhaps one should start by pointing there.
Part of the story of course is the growth in youth competitions, which will finally ensure pathways from grassroots to elite football for women. For example, in NSW and the ACT, the first competition for girls under the age of 12 had 30 teams in its inaugural year. Nonetheless, it would be a mistake to see the boost in overall participation as wholly dictated by “girls” taking up the sport. Anecdotally, AFLW has been a game-changer for women who had written themselves off from participating in sport. And the numbers back this up. The Victorian Amateur Football Association, which started with a base of four ex-VWFL clubs, ended up with five senior divisions and an unofficial “scratch match” division of six teams for clubs with an overflow of numbers.
These numbers tell an important and revealing story. They tell of women too long ostracised from a game they didn’t have a chance to know they loved. Women like Jacinta, or Anne, who turned to music and politics, to anything but sport, and AFL football in particular. For them, sport went hand in hand with misogyny, with disrespect for women: whether this be at the level of sexist uniforms for girls, or protection and reward for men who behave badly at the elite level.
It doesn’t matter how accurate this story is. Those of us who love sport know too well the nuances of the games we love: we know the stories about the St Kilda schoolgirl, but we also know about the involvement of stars like Marcus Bontempelli, Patrick Dangerfield and Shaun Burgoyne in The Line’s violence against women ambassador campaign. We know that sport is not the unambiguous monster that it can seem until you love it enough for those complexities to emerge, to give it the benefit of the doubt it only sometimes deserves.
The joy of so many more girls and women now involved in the game is both their chance to feel what sport brings so many of us and also what their participation does to the sport and its culture from within. After AFLW, Australian rules football will never be the same, and that is an unambiguously good thing.


Kieran Tierney has made a habit of bucking trends. Where emerging youngsters in Scotland would be readily coaxed by the bright lights and brighter pay cheques of the Premier League, Tierney has no such short-term aspiration at all.
Attitude and application have denied Scotland a host of footballers who shone in their youth but Tierney displays a level of determination that sets him apart from his peers. When Anderlecht visit Celtic needing to win by three goals or more to knock the home side out of the Europa League qualifying spot on Tuesday, the left-back will be afforded his latest chance to continue a process of learning that has seen scouts line up to file recommendations.
Brendan Rodgers provokes smiles with occasional over-praise of individuals but his assessment of Tierney comes without contradiction. The Celtic manager knows a thing or two about the fulfilling of talent having overseen as much during previous coaching spells.
“I’ve worked with who I consider to be the two best full-backs in Britain: Danny Rose at Watford and Ryan Bertrand at Chelsea,” said Rodgers. “Kieran is right up there with those boys. He’s still very young, still has bits of improvement to make but his quality, his will and determination and his focus for a young player is outstanding. This is a young player who can play in the top four of the Premier League if that’s where he wanted to go.
“He’s got an incredible determination, an old-school determination. He lives his life right, he doesn’t drink or do stupid things. He’s in every day training like a dog.”
Tierney’s marquee moment, an indication of his approach, did not even arrive during a phase of play. In last May’s Scottish Cup final he was cracked in the face by the elbow of Aberdeen’s Jayden Stockley, leading to a hospital trip and emergency dental surgery for the Celtic player. “I’d have spat my teeth out to play on,” Tierney said. He reappeared at Hampden Park, where he had to negotiate security before bounding up the stairs to join the Scottish Cup victory parade.
That Tierney adores Celtic as much as football is clearly useful to the club, who recently gave him a contract to 2023. This love affair is mutual; Celtic’s fans can identify with Tierney, who would not swap his employer for any in world football.
Naturally that will change; Tierney’s recent joining of a high-profile management company infers there is knowledge of a pathway to England at some stage. For now, he has captained Celtic without starting 100 league matches. Celtic’s commanding of high fees for Aiden McGeady, Victor Wanyama and Fraser Forster means Tierney will not be coaxed away cheaply. That he represents a nation worryingly unaccustomed to producing blue-chip talent should make no difference on that front.
Not only does Tierney barely miss a training session, coaches revel in the fact he approaches each one in the same manner as games. The same applies to opposition; Tierney will treat Kylian Mbappé like a forward at Hamilton Academical which, rather than displaying naivety, illustrates a wonderful unwillingness to cower in the face of reputation.
Tierney, like many of his team-mates, endured harrowing evenings in Paris and Munich during this Champions League campaign but he also delivered an outstanding home performance against Bayern that, in spells, visibly impressed Celtic’s German opposition.
That Celtic have a highly valuable commodity in Tierney is undeniable. At 20, and without being disparaging towards Andy Robertson, Tierney is superior to his compatriot and fellow left-back who commanded a recent transfer to Liverpool. Therein lies an interesting parallel; whereas Robertson found himself rejected by Celtic and motivated by a hunger to rebuild his career, Tierney benefited from a positional change while in the Scottish champions’ development system.
As a left midfield player, Tierney was unlikely to be a Celtic star. He was not, after all, cut from the same winger’s mould as defines so many of the club’s icons. It is testament to Ronny Deila, a Celtic manager under regular pressure, that he not only afforded Tierney a first-team debut at left-back but oversaw the player making that position his own. “Kieran can go all the way,” predicted Deila.
It has been Rodgers’s task to increase Tierney’s game intelligence and compensate for the player’s one main shortcoming, a lack of height. Tierney is brilliantly powerful to the point where shortcomings are masked, he retains superb tackling skills when one-on-one and has shown a ferocious shot on occasion. Tierney’s versatility has led to him being deployed at centre-half and even right-back, for Scotland, but his future will inevitably be on the left side of defence. It will also, barring something unforeseen and extraordinary, be bright.


Many are the reasons that have been offered for Leicester’s fairytale run to the Premier League title in 2016: heartwarming team spirit, a charismatic and quirky manager, the goals of Jamie Vardy, the genius of Riyad Mahrez, a lethal counterattacking style opponents recognised but couldn’t cope with, the reward of carb-heavy pizza in exchange for clean sheets, and the strange inability of each and every one of their major rivals to put them under any kind of pressure. But in the time that has elapsed since Wes Morgan hoisted the Premier League trophy skywards to mark the most fitting of ends to the most implausible of feelgood stories, the significant contribution of one man to Leicester’s triumph has been overlooked. A referee as quick to blow his own horn as he is his own whistle, Mark Clattenburg clearly feels he hasn’t got the credit he deserves for almost singlehandedly winning Leicester City the title and has finally stepped forward to explain how it was him wot won it.
Now working in a well paid gig as the head of Saudi Arabia’s referees, Clattenburg was in charge of the bad-tempered draw between Chelsea and Tottenham that eliminated Mauricio Pochettino’s team from the title race and confirmed Leicester’s ridiculously unlikely status as champions. What’s more, speaking in an interview in the USA! USA!! USA!!!, the famously pleased-with-himself official from Durham has announced he more or less made up the rules as he went along on the evening in question, so nobody could blame him for costing Spurs the title on a night when their players completely lost the plot.
“If I sent three players off from Tottenham, what are the headlines? ‘Clattenburg cost Tottenham the title,’” he said in an interview with the Men In Blazers podcast. “It was pure theatre that Tottenham self-destructed against Chelsea and Leicester won the title. Some referees would have played by the book; Tottenham would have been down to seven or eight players and probably lost and they would’ve been looking for an excuse.”
So there we have it: he had one job. And the job in question? Maintaining control of a game of football by adhering to assorted laws with which, we must assume considering his lofty status, he is very familiar. And yet rather than enforce them and almost certainly ensure Leicester won the title, he preferred to hope that an out-of-control Tottenham with a full set of players would fare no better than an out-of-control Tottenham that had been correctly reduced to seven or eight players. As luck would have it, Clattenburg’s gamble paid off, neutrals got a rollocking white-knuckle ride and Leicester were crowned champions, but that’s rather beside the point. Your po-faced Fiver can’t can’t help but feel that if this was his attitude going into big games, then the fussiness of so many of his former colleagues that so infuriates on a weekly basis may be no bad thing.

The FA’s Martin Glenn has demonstrated his nous yet again, stating that Gareth Southgate’s job will not be under threat even if England return from the World Cup after shoeings from Belgium, Tunisia and Panama. “Gareth has a long-term contract.

Jimmy Anderson admitted to there being “some pretty frustrated players” in the England dressing room after a collapse with the bat on the third day in Adelaide, followed by a late surge of wickets with the ball, left a lingering sense of what could have been for the tourists.
Bowled out for a meek 227 in response to Australia’s first innings 442 for eight declared, Joe Root’s side were not asked to follow on by Steve Smith. They responded by reducing the hosts to 53 for four under lights, with two wickets apiece for Anderson and Chris Woakes.
But with Australia leading by 268 runs going into day four, England were still staring at the prospect of going 2-0 down in their Ashes defence before the third Test in Perth, where they have not won since 1978. For their record-wicket-taker, the last man out as Craig Overton top-scored from No9 with an unbeaten 41, it was galling.
“We should have got more runs,” said Anderson, who went on to pick up two for 16 with the ball. “We’ve got some very frustrated players in the dressing room. All we can do as bowlers is try our best, and that’s what we did. We gave it absolutely everything.”
Smith’s decision not to enforce the follow-on, and offer England’s attack a chance to redeem their performance from the first innings after dark, was controversial despite their holding the whip hand. Mitchell Starc, who earlier claimed three for 49, distanced himself from the call.
“We didn’t tonight, he’s the captain and he makes the decisions” replied Starc, when asked if Smith had consulted his seemingly still fresh attack. “We had a tough session with the bat but there’s a lot of cricket to go. But in terms of the follow-on, it’s all up to Smithy.”
Starc revealed Australia’s bowlers had learned how best to use the pitch when watching England’s attack bowl too short in their first innings. Though remedied in their late burst, which saw Woakes claim the key wicket of Smith lbw for six, Root’s side must be kicking themselves.
On Overton, with whom he shared a stand of 66 that likely altered Smith’s plans to bowl again, Woakes said: “I thought he batted beautifully on debut. He was getting plenty of verbals, as you would expect, and plenty of short stuff. I was pretty annoyed with the way I got out [caught and bowled by Starc on 33], I feel I probably left a few runs out there.
“We’re behind in the game, but we’ve fought back and shown some good character and put some pressure back on Australia. I think that’s really important.”


The man who led Great Britain’s male gymnasts to a record medal haul at the Rio Olympics has been suspended and an investigation has been launched into alleged misconduct.
Eddie van Hoof, who was named UK coach of the year in 2016, has been suspended by British Gymnastics. It is the latest in a series of controversies to hit the governing body which was last month forced to admit that it had not, as yet, come to an agreement with its biggest stars over World Class Performance Programme contracts.
Van Hoof has led the men’s artistic gymnastics programme since 2005 and was honoured by the Queen with an MBE after the 2016 Games. The men’s gymnastics team produced some of the standout British performances of the Rio Olympics with Max Whitlock winning double gold on the floor and pommel and Louis Smith and Nile Wilson also winning medals. There is no suggestion these athletes were affected by any of the alleged incidents.
But the Guardian understands a number of elite gymnasts, past and present raised concerns about Van Hoof’s conduct.
The governing body refused to comment on the nature of the allegations which led to Van Hoof’s suspension, releasing a statement which read: “British Gymnastics confirms that an independent investigation is being conducted into allegations of misconduct relating to Eddie van Hoof, pending the outcome of which he has been suspended.
“The suspension is not a disciplinary penalty, and indeed does not imply any assumption of guilt. We will not be making any further comment at this time.”
Van Hoof is a former competitive gymnast who took up the sport aged 12 and competed at the 1984 Olympics while also qualifying as a teacher.
After being awarded with the coach of the year title he said: “In gymnastics, my first coaching job came straight off the team in 1995 and we were always around 19th in the world, which was good, but to be up there with the leaders of the sport shows just how much progress has been made in the last 10 years.”
But the medal winning performances of British gymnasts have been accompanied by rumblings of discontent behind the scenes. The Guardian revealed many of the biggest stars, including Whitlock, are still yet to reach an agreement with British Gymnastics over the content of performance contracts which determine whether they receive the funding from UK Sport. This paper also revealed that a British Gymnastics licensed coach was being investigated by police after parents made allegations about emotional and physical abuse of young athletes.
It was just the latest in a series of duty of care scandals to blight British Olympic and Paralympic sport. Rob Greenwood, who shared the coach of the year award with Van Hoof in 2016, was let go from his role as Paralympic swimming performance director after an investigation found he presided over a “culture of fear”.
Van Hoof is yet to comment on the investigation.


“He calls in the defenders first: breaks a TV. He calls in the midfielders and he breaks a light. Calls in the strikers, breaks a sofa.” One of José Bordalás’s former players tells the tale and, although he’s laughing, he’s only half joking. The Getafe manager began his coaching career in the third division nearly 24 years ago and there are other moments like it, not far beneath the carefully-cultivated impeccable appearance, breaking beyond the tidy beard and smart glasses: benches have borne witness, press rooms too, and that’s just the public displays. There have been fridges kicked and doors punched, tactics boards butted. “He has his foot up against your throat and doesn’t let go,” says Juan Cala. The Getafe defender means it figuratively of course, but another says: “You sometimes wonder if he’s going to hit you.”
That player recalls Bordalás’s assistant chasing a team-mate around the training pitch, saying things, trying to wind him up. Before a game, a long time ago now, Bordalás made another hold a pencil between his nose and top lip, and cross his eyes. Now stay like that, he told him. He wanted them to go on the pitch wearing a “crazy face” to “terrify opponents”. Defenders were told to grab strikers, fight them. Every ball is a battle. “You spend the week building to the game, all week. And every game it’s like you’re playing for your life; if you don’t win it’s an absolute disaster,” Cala says. Another footballer calls him “a bit peculiar”, but he’s certainly not stupid. Asked to define him in a phrase, here’s an answer: “Very, very, very intelligent.”
As for Cala, he defines Bordalás in a single word: rendimiento. Performance. There is something about him that gets the best out of them. Look at the table and there are Madrid’s “other” teams. Leganés, coached by Bordalás’s one-time assistant Asier Garitano, sit seventh. And, less than three miles from there across the motorway, Getafe are eighth. They sit one and two points off a European place, respectively. So what? So these are clubs whose derby was traditionally played in the third tier, whose only objective is survival, and who arguably shouldn’t even be here at all. A little over a year ago, Leganés were a single place off the relegation zone. Getafe, meanwhile, were second bottom.
Of the second division.
That was when they turned to Bordalás. Getafe had recovered a little but seven weeks in they still sat 21st. They were about to become Bordalás’s 11th club as a coach and none had been in the first division, which wasn’t his place – or so it seemed. A technical striker nicknamed ‘the Roman’ who retired early because of a knee injury, having been at 11 clubs and never above the third division, he spent most of his coaching career there, working around his native Alicante (where he managed three times), until he moved to Alcorcón. With them, he reached the play-offs to primera in 2012-13 and in 2015-16 he brought Alavés up as champions. The problem was that he didn’t get to go up with them, the job instead given to Mauricio Pellegrino – a decision which seemed to say something about him but might have said just as much about prejudice. In truth, it was as much about tension between him and the board but it also tapped into the idea that, somehow, he was fine for the second division but couldn’t do what he did in the first.
The decision, as it turned out, was good for Alavés – they finished ninth and reached the Copa del Rey final – and even better for Getafe. In the autumn, posters started appearing in Getafe showing Bordalás’s face with the slogan “take me to primera”, and he did. A second promotion in a row, with a second club. Yet, ridiculous though it sounds, some wondered if he might face a second sacking. There were still doubts about his continuity, Getafe’s president Ángel Torres cornered on camera and pretty much forced into announcing he would carry on during a TV interview that was conducted mid-celebration and felt like a set-up. But Getafe were back in the top flight and Bordalás was there at last. “Bordalás, a first division manager,” one headline ran, a little pointedly.
At the end of the season, Getafe released central defender Cata Díaz, leaving his wife Celeste Marzella attacking Bordalás as “false, a traitor and a coward”, accusing him of having spies in the dressing room. But those who are close to the manager are very close and extremely loyal. It is no coincidence that many of the same players end up working with him again. He is, players insist, an expert in group management. He brings players together – often against some perceived common enemy, from the outside or, sometimes, from within – and is skilled at getting them to understand what he wants. Motivation is key and even those that see oddness see value; they recognise he gets a lot from his squad and there’s fondness too. Bordalás can be angry, wound up, hot-headed, demanding, but the intensity is relieved by the fact that he can be genuinely funny too. “He might transmit nastiness sometimes but even years later people remember the things he said, the amusing phrases,” says one close observer.
Bordalás has a strong team around him – fitness coach Javier Vidal is very highly rated – and he is, in the words of one player, “very, very intense”. Cala says: “He controls every aspect: diet, rest, training, tactics. And his training sessions are incredibly pesado, heavy-going. The intensity is unbelievable.” Another says: “He would go absolutely crazy if you didn’t do what he wanted.” He seeks to take advantage of every detail he can, seeing significance in the “other football” – knowing when to break a move down, how to effectively end a game. What he wants always includes not letting the other team play. The message is relentless and it is clear, simple: compete.
Getafe have competed so far, that’s for sure. They have lost three times at home this season: 2-1 against Barcelona, 2-1 against Madrid, 1-0 against Sevilla. In all three, they probably deserved more, although they could stand accused – and striker Jorge Molina admitted as much – of perhaps dropping too deep. Their style is simple: tight, aggressive, direct. Not always pretty, but often pretty effective.
It can be tempting to see Uruguayan full-back Damián Suárez as the embodiment of that style, at times almost cartoonish in his aggressiveness and risky too; Vicente Guaita has had a superb season in goal; Djené Dakonam has impressed; and the speed and skill of Ángel has been striking. But this is a collective and then there are a couple of other players who particularly stand out. Markel Bergara has given them consistency and a character that is contagious. In 14 games he has also scored more than he did in 146 for Real Sociedad. Then up front they have Molina, one half of Bordalás’s favoured little-and-large approach, top scorer last season with 20 goals and central to everything they do this – the 35-year-old who helps define their style.
“He’s the only one in the team who is irreplaceable,” Cala insists. “Ángel can be missing, Markel can be missing, Djene, me … but Jorge can’t. We don’t have anyone else who can do what he does. 60%, 70%, of our game is long ball and the only one who brings it down is Jorge. He battles with the centre-backs, controls it, moves. People say ‘yeah, but so-and-so …’ No, no, no: Jorge. If you’re defending and you can go long to him, that means the world. He gives us life.”
There is life in Getafe, where as far as the manager is concerned every defeat is a “death”, week after week after week. Last Monday, Getafe were defeated 1-0 at Espanyol. “After that, the week he gave us … pffff,” Cala says. “Horrific.” Six days later, they became the first team this season to beat Valencia, denying them the chance to close to within two points of Barcelona at the top. It was the kind of game that defines them, for better and worse. Despite being a man down from the 25th minute after Mauro Arambarri got his second yellow, despite suffering at times, Bergara’s deflected shot gave them a lead after 67 minutes. Dani Parejo hit the post with a free-kick, Guaita was sharp and the goal came as Valencia were starting to get behind them and create chances; after that, the game changed. It would be tempting to say it died, which was what Getafe wanted.
As the clock ticked away, there were bodies everywhere. Players in blue dropped like flies, if not flies who actually had much wrong with them. Simone Zaza grinned at a ballboy, gesturing to him; the cheeky scamp grinned back. They both knew what he was up to and he wasn’t about to go any faster. There was still time for more opportunities, though: the board went up with five minutes on it – it could have said twice that – and in the very last minute Zaza headed over. At the whistle, the Coliseum erupted, Getafe’s players embracing and punching the air. They really are back.
Before the game, Bordalás had gone round telling his players of the importance to make it “uncomfortable” for Valencia and they did that. Afterwards, just as Ivan Rakitic had done a few weeks before, Parejo complained about the state of the pitch, which was dry and cut up. “It looked like they haven’t tended to it all week,” he said. Parejo insisted it was “no excuse”, but it was part of the explanation – even though, while it probably helped Getafe, it has been a problem that some of their players feel they have endured too – just as the way the home side tried to prevent much happening was part of the explanation. Up until the sending off, they had three cards and lots of fouls: “That’s football but it made it difficult for us,” Valencia’s assistant manager Rubén Uría admitted.
“Today this looked like the team I want,” Bordalás said, throat hoarse and voice barely audible. “If we don’t compete, we fall a long way. Today they gave everything. What honour! What humility! That’s what I take with me – that and the kilometres they ran.”
They had done what no one else could – not Barcelona, not Atlético, not Sevilla either – and beaten Valencia, taking Getafe nine points and 10 places clear of the relegation zone. “Fans are ‘brave’; maybe they’ll start talking about Europe but our only objective at the start, now, and at the end is survival,” Cala said. “And tomorrow Valencia will have gone. Tomorrow he’ll be talking about Saturday again, living the game, like: ‘Bloody hell, we’re playing for our lives here’.”
• “Another train departs,” ran the front cover of AS. On Saturday afternoon, Barcelona departed the Camp Nou, heads down, Sergio Busquets lamenting the two points lost against Celta while Iago Aspas, who was superb, insisted: “It’s never a good day to come here but this time we deserved a draw … in fact, a point might even be too little given that we had another chance to make it 3-2.” By Saturday night, though, the point looked pretty good. “A point the size of a Cathedral,” Sport called it. By Sunday night, it looked even better.
The reason was simple: Barcelona drew with Celta, but Madrid couldn’t take advantage. Twice they hit the post and there were opportunities to have won it but they drew 0-0 at San Mamés. After 35 consecutive away games scoring, that’s two in a row that have finished without a goal. Zidane said he was happy, which is what he always says, and Madrid might have won it but yet again this wasn’t just about missed opportunities. As the game went on, so they ran out of ideas, delivering cross after cross that mostly went nowhere in particular. In the pouring rain, the imprecision was alarming – and not just from Athletic.
So, Barcelona’s lead over Madrid was retained – and, ultimately, their lead over Valencia was expanded. That said, they lost Samuel Umtiti to a torn hamstring. La Liga’s best defender so far this season, he’ll be out for two months. “Another league starts here,” said AS, and they might be right. Madrid are fourth now, and have next week’s opponents Sevilla just behind them after they won on Saturday. Of the top four, only Atlético got all three points, their first big night at A Stadium Called Wanda ending with an 88th-minute winner to see off Real Sociedad 2-1. For all the doubts, they’re unbeaten this season – a run that goes back 18 games, a club record.
• Applause for Asier Garitano. Not only did his Leganés side beat Villarreal, to end a four-match, fearful-fixture packed losing run, he also got into a touchline discussion with Villarreal captain Mario in which he told his opponent not to give the ball back from a throw-in and then told off his fans for whistling him. “We don’t kick the ball out and we don’t ask anyone else to do so either,” he said.
• “At last,” said Xavi Aguado. “It was a matter of time,” replied Pablo Alfaro. They both received 18 red cards in La Liga. That was a record once, but not any more. On Sunday night Sergio Ramos got his 24th red card, his 19th in the league.
• And Las Palmas won! (Pako Ayesteran was sacked in midweek, in case you’re wondering.) They sliced through Betis, whose manager Quique Setién is on the ropes. “The players are scared,” he said. “The ball is burning their feet.”
Results: Málaga 0–0 Levante, Barcelona 2–2 Celta, Atlético 2–1 Real Sociedad, Sevilla 2–0 Deportivo, Athletic Bilbao 0–0 Real Madrid, Leganés 3–1 Villarreal, Getafe 1–0 Valencia, Eibar 3–1 Espanyol, Las Palmas 1–0 Betis. Monday: Girona v Alavés.


If you find a bruise, punch it. In the political arena, teachings do not come much clearer. On the evening of day three, Steve Smith had a chance to land a Jean-Claude Van Damme spin-kick into Joe Root’s ribs. By not enforcing the follow-on, the Australians allowed the visitors to sleep a lot less battered than they should have.
It may not be that much of a sample size, but the indisputable learning from day-night Tests is that it is much harder to bat under lights when the ball is hard and new. When Australia toppled England barely a quarter of an hour into the final session on Monday, their bowlers had earned the opportunity to humiliate England and go again. There was a chance to dismiss Root’s top order – the captain included – twice in a day.
Instead, Jimmy Anderson found the burst of energy he was looking for, then Chris Woakes too. The fruit of their labour is that Smith, David Warner, Usman Khawaja and Cameron Bancroft have all had their final bat in the match. “It was purely up to Smithy,” Mitchell Starc said of the decision after play, carefully answering a barrage of questions to avoid throwing his captain under the bus.
Did the fast bowlers get consulted? “We didn’t tonight.” But asked on ABC radio if he would have liked the chance, he wasn’t shy: “Night-time is the best to bowl.” In modern times, fast-bowling workloads are the usual reason not to go again. In this case, the attack-leading left-armer had sent down only 20 overs, while Josh Hazlewood and Pat Cummins had 16 apiece.
When the call was made, the temperature outside was 15C and 26 overs were scheduled before the close. If ever the factors had lined up for a follow-on tilt, this was it. “We know the night session is the toughest time to bat,” Starc said, to reinforce the self-evident point. “As we saw tonight, for example.” We sure did.
Of course, the conservative decision did not undo Australia’s fine work with the ball. With another Nathan Lyon bag of four, The Smiths might ask to stop me if you think you’ve heard this one before. His first wicket – Australia’s third of the morning – made it 50 in Tests against the old enemy. Another trundle, another record.
In 2017, he is now equal top of the world charts with 55 victims at 22 apiece. Lyon’s fourth wicket, to finish off England after the dinner break, had him passing the great inter-war leg-spinner Clarrie Grimmett for wickets taken at the Adelaide Oval, with only four Australian greats left ahead of him.
It is no surprise that his success on Monday came against left-handers: he has seen off 28 of those this year at an absurd average of 12.5. Alastair Cook was the first, coaxed into probing when he did not need to. He has now fallen to Lyon six times in 15 duels.
Moeen Ali’s edge was beaten on three occasions upon arrival but he fell due to individual brilliance of another kind, when Lyon threw himself with his non-preferred left hand to pull off a brilliant diving return catch. That trick was replicated by Starc 20 minutes later in a reflex take off Jonny Bairstow.
There might be a bit of luck and instinct involved in dismissals like these, but the athleticism in the field shown by Australia’s bowlers highlights that they bring more to the side than flinging or ripping at the bowling crease. Hazlewood’s efforts to haul down a boundary, diving and flicking with his left hand to keep the ball in play, was further evidence.
As for Cummins, CricViz calculated during England’s horrid top-order display that he has middled more balls this series than any of the touring batsmen. Little wonder that Starc has been tweeting that the No9 can graduate into his position at eight any time he feels like it. There is no letting off with this quartet when hunting wickets or otherwise.
It makes Smith’s decision all the more puzzling. Having removed England for 227 during the day, imagine the carnage Australia’s attack might have caused at night. The chance of it making a material difference in this game is slim but England’s quicks are at least in the scrap. They might now land a few punches themselves.


Great Expectations, so the rather lame joke goes, is not nearly as good a read as you would hope. And it is fair to say they were in short supply when Craig Overton tramped out to the middle at 4.58pm on the third day in Adelaide with England staring into the void and Australia rampant.
Here was England’s debutant No9 joining Chris Woakes at the crease with the score 142 for seven and the deficit a neat 300. A swift and total subsidence by Joe Root’s side and there was every chance Steve Smith may have invited them for another evening interrogation under the lights. Overton, fresh from three ducks in the warm-ups, was on for the dreaded “Audi”.
While it was known that Overton is no mug with the bat for Somerset, in these parts it is as much about courage for the lower order. A working over in the nets on the night before his debut – a first clue that we would replace the heavily-bombed Jake Ball from the XI at Brisbane – was still but a mere taster of what was to come from Australia’s quicks.
But what followed showed that while the 23-year-old is clearly still raw, and his promotion has come about through a combination of injuries and suspension, the greatest unknown when making the step up to Test level – temperament – can be ticked off.
In gutsing out an unbeaten 41 – one of bobs, weaves, guides and the odd club, while never taking backward step against Mitchell Starc and co – Overton not only added to his three wickets in the first innings but became the first England debutant to top score from No9 for 118 years.
The stand of 66 from 99 balls between Woakes (33) and the 6ft 5in Overton, while resembling Han Solo and Chewbacca firing off their blasters on the retreat and forcing Smith to bat again, also brought with it of sense of what might have been from the batsmen earlier in the day however; the players for whom expectations are greater.
After all, morning rain on the banks of the Torrens had made way for what was a fine afternoon on what has been the flattest of the three Adelaide day-night pitches to date. England, for all the gloom of their first two days, were expected to lay down a statement of intent that, if the Ashes are indeed changing hands, theirs would at least be cold and dead upon release.
But just four balls into his morning’s work and James Vince was toddling off, having for the second innings in a row nicked off to offer a creeping suspicion that his 83 first up at Brisbane was the exception. Josh Hazlewood has now located the ideal length for a No3 so flirty he will be next up on “Ashes Pashes” challenge that urges couples in the crowd to kiss on the big screen.
“This is the partnership, this is the Test, this is the Ashes,” drawled Shane Warne on the Channel 9 commentary after Root punched gloves with Alastair Cook in the middle. Twenty minutes later, however he was gone, having skewed a drive to slip off Pat Cummins on nine when failing to get fully over the ball. Australia, it must be said, are enjoying their hold over England’s captain.
Thereafter it was a case of the specialist batsmen not meeting the brief of their head coach, Trevor Bayliss, and being ruthless enough to go big when set. Each had faced 50 balls, two – Jonny Bairstow and Moeen Ali – chipped return catches and Cook, though moving better than in Brisbane, was particularly deflating when he nibbled at Nathan Lyon’s first ball after a drinks break.
Only Dawid Malan, undone by a fine piece of bowling from Cummins that nicked the inside edge, can be said to be exempt, although Nathan Lyon, enjoying himself against the left-handers, is clearly in his head after some skittish dancing down the track to Australia’s emboldened off-spinner.
In the summer England’s batsmen were accused of not respecting Test cricket after a loose and crushing defeat to South Africa at Trent Bridge and a response resulted thereafter. Here, though they are facing a well-oiled attack bowling fuller and quicker than their own, some personal hunger may need to be challenged again or the expectation is for a heavy series defeat.


Perhaps the smartest conclusion would be to avoid drawing any from the Hero World Challenge. A year ago, after equalling tournament winner Hideki Matsuyama for number of birdies over four rounds, Tiger Woods departed the tournament supposedly on the verge of a great renaissance.
Woods spoke positively about the future, just as the wave of expectation surrounding him rose once more. By the start of February, Woods cut a stricken figure as he limped from the Dubai Desert Classic whilst unable to counteract back spasms beyond 18 holes. It would be easy to infer that Woods’s lowest ebb, a driving under the influence charge that occurred in May, somehow triggered the upturn in personal and professional fortunes that has subsequently transpired. Even that requires context; Woods today leaps inside the top 670 in the world. He has been No1 for a record 683 cumulative weeks.
Woods’s Hero showing last year featured rounds of 73, 65, 70 and 76 for a total of four over par. He exited Albany on Sunday evening having carded 69, 68, 75 and 68 to aggregate eight under. Woods’s long game, especially when produced with an effortless swing for a high and booming draw, this time appeared the equal to anyone in a stellar field with drives regularly pitching 295 yards from the tee.
For all he has adopted a more open approach in recent times, there remains a Woods arrogance to the point of dismissal. He made cutting reference towards “intelligent people” who had suspected embarrassment may be forthcoming from Thursday onwards. “I knew how I was playing at home, I knew how I was hitting shots, I knew what was going on,” Woods insisted.
Yet even Woods’s caddie, Joe LaCava, admitted an element of surprise. “I had a little advantage of seeing him twice in the last month, so I knew it was getting better and getting closer,” said LaCava. “But I didn’t think it was going to be quite as good as it is at the moment. We’re much more optimistic going forward than we were last year.”
The 41-year-old’s key statistics were decent if not spectacular; the finding of 46 of 72 greens in regulation, 34 from 52 fairways and a total of 100 putts. Woods was never the most accurate of drivers but, crucially, he could hit the ball further than anyone else and putt better than anyone else. It seems a huge leap of faith to suggest either will be the case before the unlikely event that Woods takes to seniors golf.
The class of today may be in two minds as to whether they actually want an imperious Woods as part of the scene. Justin Thomas was reasonable enough to admit as much. “I’ve never played against that Tiger,” said the USPGA champion. “I don’t want that Tiger just because judging by the statistics, not many of us would have that great of a chance.
“But at the same time, obviously we want to be able to play against him and battle down the stretch with him. I mean, that’s the person that I was making putts on the putting green when I was six, seven, eight years old pretending to beat. So it would be pretty fun to do it in person.”
The only time to paint an adequate picture of where Woods in his current condition sits in a competitive sense is after the playing of a full tournament schedule. Wide fairways and essentially a low-key Bahamas event – typically epic attention on Woods aside – doesn’t compare to Augusta National. It doesn’t compare to Carnoustie, the most ferocious of venues which will host the Open in July. How will a player who hasn’t won a major since 2008 and any tournament at all since 2013 react when back in the position to close out?
Nobody, including Woods, yet knows if apparently strong physical condition can withstand regular visits to PGA Tour events. When Woods admits the average age for a spinal fusion, as he underwent in his last surgery, is 58 there seems an obvious implication for his sporting longevity even before the stress as placed on backs by golf swings is factored in.
Rickie Fowler, who prevailed on Sunday, revealed Woods carded 65 during a recent practice round in Florida. It was typical, and telling, that Fowler’s champion’s press conference was dominated by questions regarding another player.
“One of the times we played 18 holes, I was going back to work out and he went and played another nine,” Fowler said. “I think he sharpened me up a little bit. I’d gotten a little scared of how good he was playing at home, thought I needed to start playing a little bit better.
“Tiger’s still going to have that similar effect when you see his name on the board coming down the last nine holes and being in the mix. You know he’s not scared. He’s done it, he’s been there before. I wouldn’t say guys are scared. I think they’re more excited about it and having him back and having the chance to play against Tiger, and we want to see him play well. It’s only better for our game.
“I want all the guys I play against to be the best that they can be. I want to be able to beat guys that are playing at their best at that time. Whether Tiger can get back to where he was in early 2000s, we don’t know. Could he get close? Possibly.”
This represented a seriously bold statement. What can be said is that Woods stepped back into the spotlight in stronger fashion than many anticipated. The certainties end there. Woods’s own painful, recurring tales of woe urge caution.


Monaco and Lyon picked up somewhat lucky wins to keep the battle for the Champions League places alive this weekend, but the top story in Ligue 1 was easily Strasbourg’s shock 2-1 win over Paris Saint-Germain. The leaders are still nine points clear of their nearest challengers, Lyon, and do not look like being reeled in, but this win is further proof of the remarkable return of one of eastern France’s most storied clubs. Strasbourg is a city with a a complicated cultural past that is caught between two countries, so it is fitting that its football team is similarly star-crossed.
Le Racing were founded in 1906 and are one of France’s oldest clubs. They have a decorated history that includes titles in all of France’s major competitions – the Championship in 1979, the Coupe de France in 1951, 1966, 2001 and the Coupe de la Ligue in 1997 and 2005 – but it would be an understatement to say they have fallen on hard times in the last few years.
A fairly successful club historically, Strasbourg won Ligue 1 in 1979 before spending much of the next 30 years bouncing between Ligue 1 and Ligue 2. The last decade has been tumultuous and painful for the club. They were relegated from Ligue 1 after the 2007-08 season and things deteriorated quickly from there. Their massively unpopular owner, Philippe Ginestet, managed to get into an altercation with then-manager Gilbert Gress, which resulted in the fans’ favourite being sacked after just two matches in August 2009.
At the end of that season they were relegated to France’s third tier, where the team battled for promotion but were undermined by the scandalous behaviour of new owner Jafar Hilali, who not only tried to prevent the club from being promoted but also took them into the regional leagues on financial terms as insolvency loomed. Even admission into France’s fifth tier was a compromise brokered by Frédéric Sitterlé, a local businessman who subsequently sold out to club legend and Alsace native (and former West Ham, Portsmouth and Blackburn player) Marc Keller for €1.
Keller received aid from local authorities to help manage the club’s debt and oversaw successive promotions back to the third tier. Attempts to get back into the professional ranks were not exactly smooth and some frustrating seasons followed, including missing promotion to Ligue 2 by a single point in 2014-15. Strasbourg won the third-tier Championnat National in 2015-16 and finally brought professional football back to the Stade de la Meinau.
The team’s improvement continued last season under Thierry Laurey as they picked up seven wins and three draws in their last 10 matches to win Ligue 2 and return to the top flight. After two promotions in as many seasons, they were back where they feel they belong. This season has had its rough moments but the team has coalesced remarkably in the last few weeks, something they capped with their victory over Paris Saint-Germain on Saturday.
Questions were asked in the summer about the team’s experience and defensive ability, but Laurey’s attention to detail and ingenuity have fashioned them into a solid side. Relegation is still a threat – they are 16th, just two points above the play-off place – but they are more than the sum of their parts and endeavour to play a relatively attractive counterattacking style of football. With only one defeat in their last 10 matches across all competitions, they now feel no opponent is too formidable, something that will have been reinforced after Saturday’s result.
The win against Paris Saint-Germain showcased Laurey’s ability as a coach but it also showed how his players have improved and grown over the last few years. While the squad has been steadily improved through transfers under Keller’s stewardship, two of the starting XI on Saturday had played for the club in the third tier: Stéphane Bahoken and Dimitri Liénard.
Bahoken’s sublimely taken winner, which embodied the team’s frightening ability on the counter, was the more eye-catching of Strasbourg’s two goals. His brilliant shot across the face of goal with the match tied at 1-1 midway through the second half not only brought euphoric scenes at the Stade de la Meinau but it also gave the the little-used striker some personal vindication. Bahoken joined the club from Nice’s reserves in 2014 and was an eager contributor last season, with seven goals, but he has often been left on the bench this season. Having risen from the third division with the club, he will have taken great satisfaction from scoring such an historic first goal in Ligue 1.
Liénard may even had felt a bigger sense of fulfilment after his lovely, curling free-kick on to the head of Da Costa helped Strasbourg open the scoring. Like Bahoken, Liénard, has risen with the club through the ranks of French football since joining them in 2013. However, unlike Bahoken, who was often used from the bench last season, Liénard’s uphill struggle for his place in the team only started this season. Liénard laid on 11 assists last season – the second highest in Ligue 2 – but after a poor showing in Strasbourg’s opening game this season – a 4-0 defeat to Lyon – he seemed more of a luxury than a necessity and was dropped as the team fought to keep their heads above water. An injury to Corgnet gave him another chance and he grasped it. He returned for a defeat to Nantes, but since then Strasbourg have lost just once in 10 competitive fixtures, and that was a game Liénard missed through suspension.
Liénard is now giving the team more than just his trademark dead-ball ability to succeed in Ligue 1. He has racked up four assists (only Neymar and Florian Thauvin have more in the league) and a couple of goals, and is evolving into a complete midfielder. If Liénard and Strasbourg continue to perform like they did on Saturday, those virtues will be rewarded come the end of the season, a just conclusion after their indignities in the last decade.
• Christophe Galtier transformed St Étienne from relegation candidates into established European regulars during his nine-year stay, but the club grew stale and the team became unimaginative towards the end of his reign. Although a new beginning was in sight when Óscar García was appointed in the summer, this season has quickly become one of their most disastrous for some time. The humiliating 5-0 home defeat to rivals Lyon last month prompted García to resign. The club bravely appointed Julien Sablé, their 37-year-old youth team coach who played for the club between 1997 and 2007, but he has done little to move the club on from the insipid, one-dimensional displays that forced Galtier to depart. The club have now had to install journeyman French coach Jean-Louis Gasset as joint-manager as Sablé lacks the required coaching qualifications to remain in sole charge. Their 1-1 draw with Nantes this weekend was comfortably the best result Sablé has achieved so far but the rebuilding process after Galtier may take longer than anyone at this proud, historic, well supported club would have hoped.
• Few sides in Ligue 1 are renowned for their attacking flair but, as their pulsating 3-2 win over Bordeaux on Friday night proved, Dijon seem intent on carrying the flag all on their own. Olivier Dall’Oglio’s team are now the top scorers outside of the top four and this victory has taken them into the top half of the table. Wesley Said’s 86th-minute winner came after Brazilian starlet Malcom had opened the scoring with a 40-yard thunderbolt – his second goal of the season contender in four days. It looked like Dijon would struggle this year without their top scorer from last season, Loïs Diony, who has not scored a single goal for St Etienne since his move, but Dall’Oglio has moulded a waspish, skilful side who play with an intensity that is difficult to contain. Although his team may not harbour genuine European hopes and they are not particularly solid defensively (only the hapless Metz have conceded more), Dall’Oglio’s refreshing outlook looks to have ensured safety for Dijon once more and made certain that Stade Gaston-Gerard is the place to go if you want goals in Ligue 1 this year.
• They still have 22 games to play in Ligue 1 this season but it’s time for Metz to start planning for a return to Ligue 2. Their 3-1 defeat at Nice on Saturday evening was their 14th loss in 16 games and they have scored just six goals all season and are yet to win a point at home. Metz conceded the most goals in Ligue 1 last season and were lucky to stay up. They relied on Ismaila Sarr and the loan singing of experienced Ligue 1 striker Cheick Diabaté, both of whom left in the summer. Diabaté returned to Osmanlispor and Sarr was sold to Rennes for €10m. Their replacements, the notoriously wayward Nolan Roux and Emmanuel Rivière, left Philippe Hinschberger without much hope and, inevitably, he was sacked in October. The arrival of the well-respected Frédéric Hantz has not helped and they currently sit 14 points from safety. Lens’ tally of 17 points in the 1988-89 season is the fewest ever achieved in Ligue 1 history; Metz could lower that record this season.
Dijon 3-2 Bordeaux, Strasbourg 2-1 Paris Saint-Germain, Lille 1-0 Toulouse, Monaco 1-0 Lille, Nice 3-1 Metz, Rennes 2-0 Amiens, Troyes 0-1 Guingamp, St Étienne 1-1 Nantes, Caen 1-2 Lyon, Montpellier 1-1 Marseille.


In a way it ended just as it was supposed to, with honour. As Peter Stöger took his final bow in front of the Köln fans who had travelled to Schalke on Saturday, doffing his cap, he was given the warm send-off his work over the last four-and-a-half years has deserved. Teenage defender Tim Handwerker wasn’t the only player wiping tears from his eyes as they said goodbye to the coach.
When the team coach arrived back at Rhein-Energie Stadion on Saturday evening, a throng of fans applauded Stöger off as he emerged. Quite rightly. Only the legendary Hennes Weisweiler – who gave his name to the club’s famous billy goat mascot – had been at the helm longer. When Stöger’s immediate replacement Stefan Ruthenbeck, who steps up from the under-19s until the winter break at least, said: “I’m not trying to fill his shoes” after Sunday’s training session, he was not overstating. “They are too big to fill, anyway,” Ruthenbeck concluded.
As Ruthenbeck starts the new week, there will be two training sessions on Monday as he attempts to galvanise the squad with a bit of tough love. For while Stöger’s last hurrah on the Effzeh bench was a worthy one – as they gutsily twice came back from a deficit to prise a point from Gelsenkirchen – and his name deserves to be cherished in the context of the club’s history, the new coach has a steep climb to negotiate.
Even after Saturday’s game against an in-form side, Köln sit bottom with no wins and only three points. No team in Bundesliga history has stayed up with such a low tally at the same stage. Seyrou Guirassy’s brace at Schalke is responsible for a third of their league goals, and statistically they have the worst defence (conceding 27) as well as the weakest attack. Given that Stöger’s team had the sixth-best defence last season, with 42 scored against them, their form at the back is perhaps even more concerning than their lack of punch up top. At least there’s an easy explanation for the latter with Anthony Modeste, scorer of almost exactly half their Bundesliga goals last season and of 40 league goals in two campaigns, having left for Tianjin Quanjian.
If this season had been about regression to the mean, that would be fair enough. The delirium of the club’s return after 25 years, wildly celebrated in this most optimistic of footballing cities, long kept scrutiny of the team’s domestic form on the back burner. Too much so, perhaps, as things have spiralled out of control. It’s great to see a team embrace the Europa League rather than moan about it, but when even at crisis point on Saturday, local attentions quickly switched to Thursday’s ‘decisive’ tie in Belgrade against Crvena Zvezda (Red Star Belgrade), you couldn’t help but ask if more attention to the home front might not be in order.
That is surely inevitable now, but it could be too late. This is a passionately followed club but a volatile one, where wobbles can quickly be followed by a descent into chaos. Sunday’s press conference to announce Stöger going was a nod to this, with president Werner Spinner and managing director Alexander Wehrle on one hand laudably frank and on the other perhaps too open about the doubt that has existed.
Sporting director Jörg Schmadtke went on 24 October, and Köln have appeared to drift ever since. Wehrle admitted they told Stöger they were looking at alternative candidates in early November, after the loss to Hoffenheim. In the days following another home defeat to Hertha, they let him know they were moving on – three weeks after initially marking his card.
The city’s newspaper Express, which broke the news of Stöger’s exit on Saturday night, also reported ex-Hamburg man Dietmar Beiersdorfer as the new frontrunner to replace Schmadtke after he was spotted in town. “Maybe he was here for the Christmas market?” Spinner suggested glibly.
This appointment is more than window dressing. In fact, the appointment of the right sporting director is arguably even more important than the next coach. Horst Heldt, Hannover’s Köln-born sporting director, had been expected to take over but his release couldn’t be negotiated. The new man, whether Beiersdorfer or someone else, is going to have play a blinder in this transfer window to give Stöger’s successor at least a fighting chance of staying up, because the current squad simply don’t look capable.
To (at least nominally) replace Modeste, Jhon Córdoba was brought in from Mainz. The Colombian has plenty of merit, but never stood a chance of matching the Frenchman’s goal output. The widespread perception was that the club had wasted €15m on a forward who had never scored more than five in a league season. Money was spent for the future, bringing in Jorge Meré and Jannes Horn, but the present looks bleak with so much confidence drained. In that sense, maybe European qualification could be a fillip rather than mere placebo.
The coaching search will not be straightforward either, with the club’s preferred candidate Markus Anfang (another Köln native) of Bundesliga 2 leaders Holsten Kiel apparently held to an enormous €10m release clause by the club’s president Steffen Schneekloth. Perhaps by default, Ruthenbeck has an opportunity to carve himself a future.
It’s extraordinary to think that, had the timing been slightly different, 51-year-old Austrian Stöger could have been in charge at Dortmund. He belatedly made BVB’s three-man shortlist to replace Thomas Tuchel – a list that has proved a kiss of death, with all three enduring difficult starts to the campaign. The talk in France was that Lucien Favre, Dortmund’s first choice in the summer, was set for the boot had Nice lost at Toulouse on Wednesday (they eventually scored twice in the last 10 minutes to turn a 1-0 deficit into a 2-1 win). Peter Bosz’s own struggles are well documented, of course.
Stöger could well bounce back in time, and few would argue against that being a good thing. He pulled Köln up from the second tier, stabilised them and took them to the giddy heights of fifth last season, earning himself an impromptu champagne bath from his giddy players in his final post-match press conference of the season. It’s sad that it all fell apart, but those travelling fans at the weekend know exactly what he did, and will continue to remember the good times.
• Bosz is still in work, with Dortmund sporting director Michael Zorc saying after the 1-1 draw at Leverkusen that “we want to achieve a turnaround with Bosz,” but they really played with fire. The coach might owe Wendell a bottle of something bubbly after the defender’s red card for a dreadful tackle on Gonzalo Castro just before half-time helped stem the Leverkusen flow. Until then, it had been fortune and a magnificent display from the maligned Roman Bürki that kept Heiko Herrlich’s side to a one-goal lead. Andriy Yarmolenko’s equaliser gives Bosz something to work with, though the additions of Maximilian Philipp and Castro to a big injury list are added headaches before the trip to Real Madrid.
• Again, Bayern Munich extended their lead at the top – now six points – without excelling themselves. They had to battle to beat Hannover, but there were two big picture pluses for Jupp Heynckes. Thomas Müller was sublime on his return from six weeks out with a muscle injury, while Franck Ribéry was also back to play his 235th Bundesliga game for the club, becoming the club’s leading foreign appearance maker in the league. André Breitenreiter’s side could consider themselves a touch unlucky, denied an equaliser at 1-0 when Nicklas Fullkrug was harshly made to take a penalty again after scoring, before missing the retake.
• Bayern have Hoffenheim to thank for their cushion, with Julian Nagelsmann’s side excellent in dismantling Leipzig 4-0. They also did FC Hollywood a turn in beginning to get the best out of loanee Serge Gnabry after an injury-affected start to the season – the former Werder man scored twice, including a sublime chip from some 45 yards with Peter Gulacsi not even that far off his line.
• It was after the Lord Mayor’s Show for Mönchengladbach at Wolfsburg, where Dieter Hecking’s current side fell to his old one and became the latest victims of the Bayern curse – the last nine sides to have beaten the behemoth in the Bundesliga have gone on to lose their following match. All credit to Martin Schmidt’s team, however, who were excellent and have now lost just one of 10 games under a coach not greeted by universal approval.
• Kevin-Prince Boateng’s beautifully struck late winner at former club Hertha helped his present one, Eintracht Frankfurt, establish the best away record. Three cheers too for Augsburg, whose win at Mainz – incorporating two fine finishes from Alfred Finnbogason – put them level on points with sixth-placed Dortmund. There was also more fuel to the campaign for Philipp Max to get a Germany call-up, after his seventh assist of the season from left-back.
• It’s now two home wins in two for Werder Bremen’s interim coach Florian Kohfeldt, with Max Kruse hitting a stylish winner to beat Stuttgart after quick thinking by Fin Bartels, who played him in from a free-kick. The points were even more vital after fellow strugglers Freiburg and Hamburg cancelled each other out in a tense goalless draw.
Results: Hertha Berlin 1-2 Eintracht Frankfurt, Wolfsburg 3-0 Mönchengladbach, Mainz 1-3 Augsburg, Leverkusen 1-1 Dortmund, Bayern 3-1 Hanover, Schalke 2-2 Cologne, Hoffenheim 4-0 Leipzig, Werder Bremen 1-0 Stuttgart, Freiburg 0-0 Hamburg.


Mark Clattenburg has said he “allowed Tottenham to self-destruct” with the way he refereed the club’s draw at Chelsea which handed Leicester City the title in May 2016.
Clattenburg booked nine Spurs players in the 2-2 draw at Stamford Bridge but says he could have sent off up to three. The former Premier League official has explained that he went in with a “gameplan” which would avoid him being blamed for deciding the title.
“I allowed them [Tottenham] to self-destruct so all the media, all the people in the world went: ‘Tottenham lost the title,’” Clattenburg told NBC’s Men in Blazers podcast.
“If I sent three players off from Tottenham, what are the headlines? ‘Clattenburg cost Tottenham the title.’ It was pure theatre that Tottenham self-destructed against Chelsea and Leicester won the title.”
Tottenham led 2-0 at Stamford Bridge and needed to win to retain a chance of overhauling Leicester. Their midfielder Mousa Dembélé received a six-match ban from the Football Association for gouging one of the eyes of the then Chelsea striker Diego Costa. Spurs were two goals ahead when that incident, which went unpunished on the night, occurred. Both clubs were fined for failing to control their players.
“I helped the game,” Clattenburg added. “I certainly benefited the game by my style of refereeing. Some referees would have played by the book; Tottenham would have been down to seven or eight players and probably lost and they would’ve been looking for an excuse. But I didn’t give them an excuse, because my gameplan was: let them lose the title.”


With Napoli hosting Juventus on Friday night, we split the regular Serie A blog in two this week. The main piece, covering that game, is here. But the rest of the weekend turned out to be rather lively as well …
• Unless you’ve been under a rock, you’ve probably heard by now about Benevento’s draw with Milan, and more specifically about the manner in which the game ended. After losing the opening 14 games of their first-ever top-flight campaign, the Witches snatched a draw in the 95th minute with a header from their keeper, Alberto Brignoli.
There are so many sub-plots with this one, but it is only right to start with the goalscorer himself. Brignoli is a man who professes to be a bit of a wimp about heading the ball in general, yet when Benevento won a free-kick just outside the area with time ticking down, he charged forwards despite being commanded by his manager, Roberto De Zerbi, not to.
“The boss didn’t want me to go up,” acknowledged Brignoli afterwards. “He can be stubborn but I’m even more so. I said: ‘I’m going. I’m going, and that’s that.’ I leapt like a goalkeeper, not an attacker. They tell me that I looked like Aldo in the scene from [the movie] ‘Tre uomini e una gamba’ (Three men and one leg), and they are right. I was a bit crooked. I closed my eyes.”
Brignoli is only the fifth keeper to score in Serie A – joining Michelangelo Rampulla, Antonio Rigamonti, Lucidio Sentimenti and, most recently, Massimo Taibi. He wasn’t even Benevento’s starting keeper at the beginning of this season, taking over from Vid Belec in October. It was hard not to warm to him, though, as he paused during post-game interviews to express solidarity with the keeper he scored against: Gianluigi Donnarumma.
😱 ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE, WHEN YOU THINK YOU'VE SEEN IT ALL... 😱😮 INJURY TIME, GOALKEEPER DIVING HEADER EQUALISER 😮Sensational drama at Benevento 👏 pic.twitter.com/3q7qVYbvYU
A point might have been the least Benevento deserved for a game in which they had more shots than Milan and held the ball, on average, much higher up the pitch. As desperate as their league standing is, performances had been improving even before this.
Four of their previous five games had been lost by a single goal – including the one away to Juventus – and there have been some especially cruel twists along the way. At Cagliari they grabbed a 93rd-minute equaliser only to concede again in the 94th. Benevento thought they had earned a draw with Sassuolo as Domenico Berardi’s penalty hit the bar in injury-time. Instead, Federico Peluso headed home a winner for the Neroverdi moments later.
So perhaps we should have seen this result coming. It was naive to imagine that there would be some immediate transformation for Milan under Rino Gattuso. The new manager has a modest coaching CV, and it will take more than his competitive fury to fix a team boasting plenty of talent but no clear tactical vision. As Gattuso himself observed afterwards: “It won’t help, right now, for me to raise my voice and smash my fists on the table.”
This result, though, will leave a mark. “It would have been better to be stabbed than concede this goal,” added Gattuso. “The lads in the changing room were desperate.”
• As Milan licked their wounds, the neighbours went top of the table. Juve’s win at Napoli had created an opportunity for Inter, who seized it eagerly with a 5-0 demolition of Chievo. Their 39 points from 15 matches equals a club record set under Roberto Mancini back in 2006-07, when they cruised to the Scudetto. Back then, though, the field had been decimated by Calciopoli.
It is hard to overstate what a fantastic job Luciano Spalletti is doing as manager, in a far more competitive field. And if any one player best represents the transformation of this team, it might be Ivan Perisic – who grabbed a hat-trick on Sunday. Next up comes the small matter of a trip to Turin to take on Juventus. The last time they met, back in February, Perisic was sent off in a 1-0 defeat.
• Roma rolled over Spal on Saturday, but Lazio kept hold of their coattails in the race for Champions League places, with a come-from-behind win away to Sampdoria. Not for the first time this season, it was Sergej Milinkovic-Savic who made the difference, scoring his team’s 80th-minute equaliser before setting up Felipe Caicedo’s winner with a clever reverse pass into the box (even if it did take a bit of a scramble from there before the Ecuadorian could bundle it home).
• Not a happy return to Serie A for Beppe Iachini, whose first league game since replacing Cristian Bucchi as manager of Sassuolo ended in a 3-0 defeat at Fiorentina. But more encouraging signs for this young Viola team, for whom Giovanni Simeone (22 years old), Jordan Veretout (24) and Federico Chiesa (20) grabbed the goals.
Results: Roma 3-1 Spal, Napoli 0-1 Juventus, Torino 1-1 Atalanta, Benevento 2-2 Milan, Bologna 1-1 Cagliari, Fiorentina 3-0 Sassuolo, Inter 5-0 Chievo, Sampdoria 1-2 Lazio. Monday: Crotone v Udinese, Verona v Genoa.


By dinner time on Monday the match was won for Australia; by supper time, a mythical feast in these parts since the cricket just keeps on giving, there was just a glimmer of hope on what had, until then, been another grim day for England. Australia possessed a mammoth first innings lead of 215. As darkness began to fall they had the perfect opportunity to bowl again just when the demons come out here.
Instead they followed the modern wisdom of never enforcing the follow-on despite the chameleon nature of the new Adelaide Oval. The ball darted around in the darkness as promised when England could have been batting a second time. Presumably an ologist of some sort had counselled against that follow-on. Now batting against Jimmy Anderson and Chris Woakes with a new pink ball was a trial. Australia finished the day on 53 for four with a very substantial lead of 268. Had England been batting surely we would already be contemplating Perth.
Anderson, who was to bowl 11 overs on the trot, soon found the edge of Cameron Bancroft’s bat. Then Usman Khawaja was lbw but what gave the assembled Barmies in front of the old scoreboard something to sing about were the dismissals of David Warner and Steve Smith in swift succession. Warner was snapped up at second slip, Smith was lbw despite reviewing – 15 minutes earlier he overturned by a millimetre or two another lbw decision off Anderson. Suddenly the game was no longer a foregone conclusion.
For the first two sessions we were visited by the ghost of Ashes past: a rampant Australian side were never stretched despite unusually benign conditions for batsmen – in daylight. No English batsman could prevail, which meant Craig Overton, batting at nine on his Test debut, was the top scorer with 41 not out. It should not have been beyond England to bat for much longer and to score many more than 227. The pitch was blameless during those two sessions especially as the ball softened.
James Vince fell in the second over of the day in the most naive of ways. This is Australia; the ball bounces higher than at the Ageas Bowl. A nondescript short of a length delivery wide of off stump enticed him to play a back foot force away from his body and the edge carried nicely to Tim Paine.
So Joe Root, restless and bristling, was early to the crease. As ever he was off and running briskly. Who knows whether he feels a peculiar pressure – but those looking on sense that everything hinges upon him, which is a mighty burden in Australia. As captain of a beleaguered side he may be over-eager to impose himself.
Pat Cummins had the wit to bowl full and fast, inviting the drive. The delivery looked to be in the slot but Root leant back as he drove, perhaps trying to hit the ball too hard. The ball was sliced to third slip, where Bancroft took the catch.
The departure of Root galvanises any side. Now despite the benign surface it was an agonising struggle for England. Dawid Malan did his best to dig in; he successfully reviewed when given out lbw to Mitchell Starc; he might have been run-out if Bancroft’s throw had hit the stumps.
Meanwhile Alastair Cook had batted with composure against the pacemen, the timing of his footwork more assured than in Brisbane. But he is more fallible against off-spinners now. He received a good ball from Nathan Lyon, which spun just enough, but his bat was still on the move as he tried to defend, which guaranteed that there was enough momentum on the ball to carry gently to slip.
Next to go was Malan to the first ball of a new spell from Pat Cummins, which took his inside edge. By now Lyon was well into his spell and he had not bowled a ball to a right-hander until his 11th over when Jonny Bairstow took strike against him.
In the afternoon session there were three consecutive caught and bowled dismissals; the last known instance of that is believed to have been at Headingley in 1962 when England were playing Pakistan. However the dismissals of Peter Parfitt, Fred Titmus and John Murray did not have such a damaging impact on England’s victory chances on that occasion as they did in this match.
Moeen Ali was the victim of a slower, flighted delivery from Lyon, which provoked a leading edge and a spectacular diving catch. Soon after Bairstow drove at Starc and the lanky left-armer stuck out his right-hand, juggling the ball briefly before calmly clutching it to claim the dismissal. The Australians were buzzing in their brand new backyard.
The plucky 66 run partnership between Chris Woakes and Overton was the solitary consolation – and an unexpected bonus. Overton had posted three consecutive ducks on this tour and Woakes has not been in spectacular form.
This pair remained calm when confronted by the promised bumper barrage, ducking dutifully, deflecting deftly until Smith and his bowlers decided to revert to a more traditional length. Then the short ball had a surprise element again, which may have accounted for a miscued pull by Woakes that gave Starc the simplest caught and bowled of the trio.
Lyon happily finished off the innings after dinner to become the leading wicket-taker in Test cricket in 2017 with 55. Overton was left unbeaten and the highest scorer – there would have been good odds on that even in Instow, where they must be thrilled how he has shown such a relish for the fight.


Last year, the former Bordeaux and Norwich City footballer Cédric Anselin excused himself from his job coaching schoolchildren and returned to his home in suburban Norfolk. He was ready to do something that had been lingering in his mind for months, even years. Anselin had come close to killing himself four years earlier but had been saved by his wife. This time he was alone and determined to complete the act. Anselin was a Ligue 1 title winner who had represented France at Under-21 level and played in a Uefa Cup final alongside Zinedine Zidane, but was absolutely ready to end his life. In the end he was saved by a single phone call.
He found himself gazing at his phone, and thinking about a fellow former footballer among his contacts. “In the darkness, this light was shining from my phone and drew my attention,” he remembers. “In a split second, I realised I needed to speak to someone, anyone. Thank God I thought of Clarke Carlisle, a former player who I knew had gone through mental health difficulties. Immediately he told me: ‘You’re not staying alone tonight and you need to stay with someone close and go to the doctor tomorrow first thing.’”
The precociously talented Anselin had risen quickly through Bordeaux’s academy, appearing in both legs of the 1996 Uefa Cup final against Bayern Munich while just 18 years old. That Bordeaux team included Bixente Lizarazu, Christophe Dugarry and Zinedine Zidane, who would all win the World Cup on home soil two years later, but playing in such company was the new normal for the young midfielder. Before the first leg of the final in Munich, the players were patrolling the pitch in Munich and Zidane asked his young team-mate why he looked so nervous. “I was still on an apprentice contract. Just before the game my immediate first thought was: ‘I wonder if am I going to miss college after this game.’ It seems crazy now but I just took it as another game, not realising that I was experiencing so much, so young.”
Bordeaux did not win the final – Bayern Munich beat them 5-1 by over two legs – but things had changed for Anselin. “I remember not long after the final, going back to college. I can’t honestly remember the class – I think it was history or something like that – and people were just looking at me as I got the bus into town. I knew things had changed for me as a footballer.”
Unfortunately, a change in managers made it hard for Anselin to break into the first team so, after an unsuccessful loan spell with Lille, the 22-year-old decided to leave France to improve his prospects. After an initial loan at Norwich City, he was awarded a permanent contract. “I arrived in England completely unable to speak English, but I was very lucky to be welcomed by everyone. I met a girl who would eventually become my wife and settled into life in Norwich.”
Anselin’s time at Norwich was plagued by injuries and, after three years, the club agreed to release him. He had been on the conveyor belt of professional football for most of his life but suddenly he was in his mid-20s and that perpetual motion had ground completely to a halt. “Football was all I knew. Through the Bordeaux academy and the clubs I had played for, you were taught to be a winner and to not contemplate failure. Yet, here I was totally unable to find a club and feeling completely hopeless. I was completely unprepared mentally.”
He found some temporary solace while playing for Ross County in Scotland but he was was feeling isolated. An agent promised him the chance to move to Mexico but that fell through and he found himself playing for Oriente Petrolero in Bolivia. After living in a hotel room by himself, contracting malaria and being paid late, he decided to return home.
Anselin returned to Norfolk and his weight and life completely spiralled out of control. “Looking back I was starting to become dead inside. I was drinking heavily and my weight was growing. Then one day I got a phone call from my French bank manager. I was surprised but picked up. He told me we needed a serious chat. It turned out €500,000 of my savings had been stolen from me by someone who I had considered extremely close. I never got it back. I had nothing left.”
Anselin found work in a local caravan park doing maintenance work to pay the bills. One day he was painting a door when a Norwich fan approached him. “He asked me are you Cédric Anselin who played for Norwich? I said, ‘Yes, that’s me.’ He just shook his hand in disbelief and asked: ‘Why are you doing this?’ ‘Because I need to live.’”
After spells with Cambridge United and in non-league football, Anselin was completely disillusioned with the game and decided to hang up his boots. “I experienced so much so young. I was naive and thought it would go on forever. I should have been better prepared for real life. I wasn’t the husband or father I should have been and that only made me feel worse about myself.”
After Anselin had been stopped from killing himself by his wife in 2012, he refused to talk about it and life moved on, somehow. However, last year, Anselin again found himself in a dark place. His marriage had not worked out, he missed his children badly and he could not reconcile his life. The young academy boy who had treated the Uefa Cup final with the nonchalance of a kickabout in the playground had become the man sat slumped alone in a lonely house.
He is unflinchingly honest about his state of mind back then. “I was going to hang myself. In a way, it felt like I was going into a football game, in terms of the focus I had to get the job done. Somehow, the light that came from my phone in the loft just forced me to focus on contacting someone for help.”
The phone call to Carlisle saved his life. The next morning he went to the GP and he eventually found himself spending a month in a psychiatric hospital. It was the beginning of a new life. “For 14 long years I had been having issues but I never ever wanted to label it. Once I was diagnosed with severe depression, everything was so crystal clear. After I came out of hospital, my son said to me: ‘You’re not going to die on me, are you Papa?’ I said: ‘I will be with you for the rest of your life.’”
Anselin is now player-manager for Sheringham FC, who play in the Anglian Combination Division One, the 12th tier of English football. How does it compare to sharing a midfield with Zidane? “It’s different, certainly, but I’ve never been happier. I am just enjoying the love of playing the game again.” He still coaches local schoolchildren and tells them about his experiences with mental health, urging them to speak to someone, anyone. He also spends his Wednesday nights bringing hot food to the local homeless people in Norwich. Anselin’s early career in Bordeaux promised footballing riches, but he has found something more valuable in Norfolk: a life spent helping other people.

This time there is no justifiable room for doubt, nor reason to go wobbly. When the International Olympic Committee meets in Lausanne on Tuesday it must ban Russia from the Winter Games in Pyeongchang. The scale of its sporting crimes is outrageous. The evidence is conclusive. Only the appropriate punishment has so far been lacking.
We live in a world where every story seems to be branded as fake news by fools, trolls, and those irreversibly blinded by their prejudices. Yet remarkably, Professor Richard McLaren’s reports into Russian doping, the second of which was published a year ago this week, have not only withstood every smear but have found their truths hardened.
McLaren, remember, told us more than 1,000 Russian athletes across more than 30 sports had been involved or benefited from state-sponsored doping between 2011 and 2015. He told us the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi was corrupted by an extraordinary ruse, in which steroid-ridden urine samples from Russian competitors were swapped for clean urine by using small metal rods to prise open supposedly tamper-proof bottles, which were then passed through a tiny hole in the dead of night. And he told us the Russian state, its security services, its sports authorities and anti-doping agency were all in on the grand deception.
Even now it sounds almost too outlandish – an institutionalised conspiracy that John le Carré might have paused before telling – yet it was all too real. The Russian government has tried to discredit McLaren and his main whistleblower, Grigory Rodchenkov, who ran the Russian Anti-Doping Agency laboratory in Moscow until fleeing last year – and to cast shades of grey on a black-and-white case, but none of the muck has stuck.
Before the Rio Olympics, however, all the evidence was somehow not enough for a conviction. When McLaren published his first report in July 2016, the IOC promised it would not hesitate to take the “toughest sanctions available” against those implicated, with its president, Thomas Bach, saying there had been “a shocking and unprecedented attack on the integrity of sports and on the Olympic Games”. And what happened?
The IOC flinched, coming up with an unholy fudge that passed the buck to the individual sports and led to 278 Russian athletes being waved through to compete in Rio under their nation’s flag. Many insiders had feared a repeat of that shabby trick before Pyeongchang, especially given that Bach – a good friend of Vladimir Putin – has been so reluctant to criticise Russia.
In the past month, however, there has been a dramatic sea change. It started when the World Anti-Doping Agency revealed that it had received fresh evidence from a whistleblower that Wada said had “reinforced” McLaren’s findings. Rodchenkov’s credibility as a witness was further confirmed when the IOC’s Oswald commission said he was telling the truth about the nature of the cover-up when it stripped the Russian cross-country skier Alexander Legkov of his Sochi medals.
Legkov is now one of 25 Russians who has been retrospectively banned since the start of November – a number that is still climbing. Separately, the IOC has also said it believes 2014-dated entries in Rodchenkov’s diary which directly implicate Russia’s deputy prime minister for sport, Vitali Mutko, in a state-run conspiracy, is “significant” evidence. Mutko, incidentally, remains in charge of the Russia 2018 World Cup despite McLaren finding an email trail showing he gave the order to “save” a banned player who had failed a drugs test.
There are also suggestions from McLaren that the whole Russia team for the 2014 World Cup was under “protection” from the authorities. It was hardly reassuring either that when Fifa’s own ethics committee appointee, Michael Garcia, investigated rumours that bribes were paid to secure the 2018 tournament, the Russian bid committee “made only a limited number of documents available for review” – because “the computers used at the time had been leased and returned to their owner after the bidding process [and then] destroyed”.
Fifa has shown little willingness to tackle any of this but there is no reason for the IOC to be so lily-livered. On Tuesday it must make a decision that is both obvious and fair. Ban the Russian team from Pyeongchang but allow those athletes not implicated by the McLaren report, and who have passed sufficient doping tests, to compete under a neutral flag.
This solution – which was adopted by athletics for Rio – would serve justice and natural justice. Russia would be deprived of sporting glory but its innocent stars would still get to live out their dreams. It would show that a ban is not about vengeance but fair play. There is growing noise within Olympic circles that the IOC is heading in this direction, and that Russia might respond by boycotting the Games. It would be better served by admitting its mistakes – something it still refuses to do.
As Rodchenkov told ESPN: “I wish Tuesday began with a confession and apology from Russia, which would give the world confidence they might embrace truth and reform – [but] this is not the Russian way. If they are not disciplined seriously, they will be laughing at the IOC behind closed doors and plotting their next caper.”
It is hard to disagree. This time there must be no weasel words, no back-room deals, no ugly accommodations. Merely justice that is desperately overdue.


Mick Easterby has certainly proved his versatility over the last fortnight, the Sheriff Hutton trainer having saddled winners of a handicap chase, a maiden hurdle, a bumper and an all-weather handicap at Newcastle, from a total of 13 runners.
Easterby’s only runner on Monday is Ladies First (12.20) at Southwell. This three-year-old has very much a sprinting pedigree and she tackles six furlongs following her racecourse debut at Wolverhampton two weeks ago over an extended mile.
Ladies First finished third there at 28-1, behind two short-priced rivals, and market support for her chance this time would definitely make her of interest. She’s 5-2 at present.
Later on the same card, Queen Moon (1.20) has a fine chance. This filly had her first run on the all-weather in October, over the same course and distance, finishing third. The winner and fourth from that race have certainly franked the form since. David Probert again takes the ride on Andrew Balding’s runner, an 11-4 shot.

Chris Cook: Each Monday through the core jumps season, we’ll monitor the relative success of 35 major jumps stables. The percentage figure is their win strike-rate for the last fortnight, while their total number of runners in that time is shown in brackets.
Ben Pauling and Harry Fry still top the table, with slightly reduced strike-rates since last Monday. Emma Lavelle has shot to prominence, thanks to three winners in the past week. Nick Williams has done well with a handful of runners. Donald McCain has had five winners since our last table was published, moving him up. That’s two more than Paul Nicholls, who has slipped a bit, as has Nigel Twiston-Davies, with just one winner since Bristol De Mai’s Haydock romp nine days ago.
Nicky Richards and Jonjo O’Neill have had a couple of winners each. Brian Ellison and Rebecca Curtis got themselves away from the bottom of the table with a single winner each, but both were on the Flat (I’m afraid I don’t have time to weed the Flat runners out of these numbers but they don’t affect many of these trainers). Curtis has gone 82 days without a jumps winner and is 0/38 in that time.

The fallout from the Ben Stokes affair could bleed into England’s plans for the one-day series in Australia after Christmas, with both the all-rounder and Alex Hales looking set for inclusion in the squad this week.
Stokes remains suspended from international duty but Hales is free for selection after confirmation he is deemed a witness not a suspect regarding the incident in Bristol on 25 September.
Eoin Morgan’s touring party was due to be announced at the end of the English summer until Stokes’s arrest over the incident. Though the selectors had no choice but to press ahead with the Ashes squad that week, the 50-over side was pushed back. But they will now publish their plans after the conclusion of the second Test in Adelaide and both players are expected to be provisionally included. As in the case of Stokes’s absence from the Ashes series, this does not guarantee both will tour.
Stokes is waiting to discover whether he will be charged after Avon & Somerset police handed his case over to the Crown Prosecution Service last week, with the timing of his cricket disciplinary hearing – and any lifting of his suspension - dependent on the outcome. The England and Wales Cricket Board will not begin an internal disciplinary process for Hales or Stokes until the conclusion of any potential criminal proceedings related to the incident. In short, it all remains a bit of mess.
As well as alerting the England selectors and management to Hales’s availability, the ECB also approved a “No Objection Certificate” to allow Hales to play in Dubai in the inaugural T10 Cricket League just before Christmas.
Neither has played for their country since the third one-day international against West Indies on 24 September, the match they were celebrating when Stokes was arrested on suspicion of actual bodily harm at 2.35am, before being released under investigation.
Stokes made a domestic comeback for Canterbury in his native New Zealand on Sunday and would naturally slot back into England’s one-day side when available. Hales, however, may face a battle to win back his spot as opener after Jason Roy saw out the remainder of the West Indies series in his place and made scores of 84 and 96 alongside Jonny Bairstow.
England take on Australia in a five-match one-day series that begins at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on 14 January, before wrapping up at Perth’s new stadium a fortnight later. The two countries then play a Twenty20 tri-series with New Zealand before England’s epic winter continues on the other side of the Tasman with five one-dayers and two Tests.


The rivalry between England’s two leading scrum-halfs, Ben Youngs and Danny Care, is becoming every bit as intense as that between Matt Dawson and Kyran Bracken in the side of the late 90s/early 00s. If that was England’s last great team, the vim of warring No9s is as strategically a valuable a dynamic as any. To date Care has been seen as the sparky game-breaker, with Youngs the game-shaper, but Care’s all-round game continues to develop. “Everyone’s going to remember him as a fantastic rugby player,” said John Kingston, Quins’ director of rugby, “but I’ve talked to him about a more enduring legacy. I see a different side of him now, certainly more mature. When he manages to amalgamate that with the smatterings of sparkle dust he’s always had, he looks some player.” Quins aren’t the only team set to benefit. Michael Aylwin

Of Newcastle’s five Premiership wins this was their third secured by a late score for a narrow margin of victory. When the game is tight the Falcons seem to have the golden ability to fashion a score, a good attribute to have, particularly given it secured a first league win since September. “Our defence was outstanding,” said their director of rugby, Dean Richards. “Against better sides we might have been found out a little bit but we dug in and came back. I loved that aspect of it. Both sides made mistakes on the night but we found a way to win it.” For Saints this was a fifth straight defeat, with only one win in nine now. They were often second best at the breakdown on Friday night and having a couple of early efforts ruled out seemed to sap their confidence, which needs restoring by the coaching team. Quickly. Claire Tolley
Frustration for Gary Gold as his Worcester side failed to defend a 14-11 lead against 14 men in the late stages of the game when they were the ones pushing for a score. The Sale winger Byron McGuigan was sent off for a second yellow-card offence after 66 minutes but it was the visitors who took the victory after Mark Jennings went over for a converted try on the left wing. Sale spent much of the second half defending and had their forwards to thank for what was their first away league win in 13 months. “We played 34 minutes when we only had 14 men and we showed great character to dig in for the whole of the second half,” said their coach, Paul Deacon. CT
Have Exeter ever played better in the Premiership than in the opening 50 minutes of Saturday’s 42-29 defeat of Bath? Probably not. Fast, physical, smart, direct, relentless … the league leaders have never been in better nick before their pivotal back-to-back European pool games with Leinster. Todd Blackadder, Bath’s director of rugby, correctly identified the Chiefs’ back-row trio of Matt Kvesic, Don Armand and Thomas Waldrom as “unbelievable” and the fly-half Gareth Steenson marshalled the onrushing traffic superbly. “It really exposed our weaknesses under pressure,” admitted Blackadder, whose side were 42-10 down with eight minutes left. “It showed us what the gap is.” His squad now head to Toulon for Saturday’s Champions Cup game with fitness doubts still hanging over the back‑rows François Louw (shoulder) and Sam Underhill (head). Robert Kitson
Gloucester find themselves second in the table. The comprehensive nature of the win may have come courtesy of David Paice’s first-half red card but Johan Ackermann’s side are the form team in the Premiership, having taken 22 points from five matches. For Irish, Nick Kennedy, the director of rugby, could hardly be blamed for his anger towards Paice. The exiles were 21-10 down at the end of the first half, when their captain was sent off for a dangerous tackle. Irish are not adrift at the bottom of the table but they desperately needed a win to build on two narrow defeats. Games against Worcester and Newcastle around Christmas will have huge significance for their season. CT
Exeter 42-29 Bath
Nothing can be taken for granted when Eddie Jones picks an England team but it looks pretty certain that Danny Cipriani will never feature in his plans. He recently turned 30 and his season has been disrupted by a knee injury, but his return to form in Saturday’s wonderful win over Leicester was a reminder, not that England’s head coach will need one, of the quality of the Wasps No10. Wasps are always more of an attacking threat when Cipriani and Jimmy Gopperth are in tandem and, with Dan Robson back to his sniping best at scrum-half, Leicester were run off their feet. “Danny is one of the best attacking No10s,” said Wasps’ director of rugby, Dai Young. “He’s worked his socks off to return early and has a massive appetite to play.” England’s current fly-half George Ford, back in the No10 shirt for Leicester this weekend, would have been a grudging admirer.

Wasps 32-25 Leicester


Everton’s failure to adequately replace Romelu Lukaku in the summer transfer window has been cited as one of several reasons for their sluggish start to the season. The Toffees have drawn seven blanks in all competitions already this season and their new manager, Sam Allardyce, has his beady eye on Watford’s club captain and striker, Troy Deeney, as a potential January recruit. Deeney has started just four Premier League matches for Watford this season and irritated his manager, Marco Silva, with very public and disparaging remarks he made regarding Arsenal’s lack of “cojones”, an appraisal one suspects might have had Allardyce nodding in agreement. A robust, physical and no-nonsense striker built in the Kevin Davies mould, one suspects Deeney and Allardyce might get along like a house on fire.
Everton are also preparing to hitch their skirts in the direction of Sevilla midfielder Steven N’Zonzi, who has fallen out with his manager, Eduardo Berizzo, since being substituted in his side’s draw with Liverpool last month. The £25m-rated France international midfielder has not played since Sevilla’s epic second-half comeback two weeks ago and has since been exiled from the first-team squad. Arsenal are also understood to be interested in giving him a new home. And on an unsurprisingly busy morning of transfer speculation regarding Everton, considering the identity of their new manager, the club – along with West Ham and Swansea City – are also being linked with a move for Augsburg’s 27-year-old Ghanaian right-back, Daniel Opare.
The fear of losing their best players to top Spanish sides gnaws constantly at Liverpool fans, who will be unimpressed to hear that Mohamed Salah’s international manager, Héctor Cúper, has confirmed that Real Madrid are keeping tabs on the Egypt winger. “I’ve received confirmed news revealing Real Madrid’s interest in Salah, but let’s not rush things,” he said in an interview on Egyptian TV. “To me, he is in an amazing position right now.” With most Liverpool fans resigned to losing Philippe Coutinho come season’s end, it looks like another close season of fretting over another potential exit looms for denizens of Anfield.
Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur both think the cut of the jib of unsettled young Real Madrid midfielder Dani Ceballos is particularly well tailored, while both north London clubs are also monitoring the progress of Trabzonspor’s 20-year-old Turkey international Yusuf Yazici. Arsenal’s popular but underused French striker Olivier Giroud has been urged to find a new club in January in a bid to help him nail down a place in France’s World Cup squad. “It’s clear that he is not getting enough playing time and Didier has already spoken to him about it,” said France’s assistant manager Guy Stephan, of a striker who has played just 234 minutes in the Premier League this season. “He has to find a solution in the coming weeks. A departure? It is up to him. He’s been very good in the past [for France] and he’s played a lot of games and scored very important goals, so now he has to play.” Could that summer move to Everton that failed to materialise be resurrected in January?
Spanish media outlet Don Balon have said that, having grown tired of dealing with Liverpool’s bean-counters in their efforts to secure the services of Coutinho, Barcelona will turn their attention to Tottenham’s Christian Eriksen. Perhaps naively, they see the Denmark international as a cheaper and more low maintenance option, but if they think dealing with the Liverpool hierarchy is hard work wait until they get a load of Daniel Levy. And finally, reports in Italy say Real Madrid have set their hearts on Juventus striker Paulo Dybala and will attempt to turn the Old Lady’s head with an offer of Toni Kroos plus cash.


Last week, with the Seattle Seahawks weakened by injuries and the NFL’s best team coming to town, Seahawks linebacker KJ Wright uttered the phrase that might ring through the final stages of this NFL season.
“Don’t sleep on us, man,” he told The Seattle Times.
“This team is still good,” he continued. “We are still talented. We can be the best of the best. We are the best of the best. And so just because we have injuries don’t mean that things will change.”
On Sunday night, the Philadelphia Eagles came into Seattle on a run few teams ever experience. Their offense had been so explosive, their defense so intimidating they were looking to be the first team in 18 years to win five straight games by 20 points. They hoped to leave with the NFC East title wrapped up a month early. Given the way they had been playing and the way the Seahawks were limping, it seemed a logical conclusion both would happen.
By now the NFL should know the Seahawks might be the league’s grittiest team, surviving more on belief than talent these days. Instead of winning by 20, the Eagles only scored twice, losing 24-10. Carson Wentz, assumed by many to be the 2017 MVP, was harried all night. His 348 yards passing were mostly garbage yards. When Seattle’s defense needed to make a stop, Wentz was pressured by swarms of players in blue, sacked three times and knocked to the ground several others. Even his two best throws – in the Eagles’ only touchdown drive – came under great duress. It was as if the Seahawks were the Seahawks again … if only for a night.
Injuries have been especially cruel to Seattle. Their famed Legion of Boom has been torn apart. Richard Sherman, their great defensive star, watched from under a blue jacket, his season done with a torn achilles. Kam Chancellor, their biggest intimidator, wore a stocking hat instead of a helmet. They have pieced together an offensive line and are on their sixth running back. Even with Russell Wilson having an MVP-level season of his own, there has been little about these Seahawks to say they can make another Super Bowl run.
Except that they won’t go away.
“They didn’t waver,” Wilson said about his team’s defense after the game. “We can’t waver. This is playoff football, you can’t waver.”
This is probably the biggest question as the season heads into the final month – and many of the NFC’s top teams lack the Seahawks’ playoff experience. The Vikings (the new top seed), Eagles and Rams are unaccustomed to being good this time of year. They have all been on magnificent runs but much as the Eagles discovered in Seattle, they may not be prepared for nights like Sunday when an experienced team comes at you with a frenzy you’ve never encountered.
Seattle have now played themselves into a wildcard spot with four games to play. They are 8-4 and just a game behind the Rams who come to Seattle in two weeks. Given the way the defense rattled Wentz and the Eagles and the way Wilson keeps making plays when no plays seem possible, there is every reason to believe Wright.
Don’t sleep on the Seahawks.
They may just be waking up for their time of year.
Blake Bortles. Imagine the Jacksonville Jaguars at 8-4 and in seeming control of a playoff spot – perhaps even a division title? Imagine too the Jags’ embattled quarterback Blake Bortles throwing for 309 yards and two touchdowns without any interceptions as he did Sunday in Jacksonville’s 30-10 victory over Indianapolis.
Yes, he did this against the Colts who are 3-9 in this year without Andrew Luck, but Bortles has been more efficient as the team has developed an aggressive defense and solid running game around him. There is a belief the Jaguars will look for another quarterback next season but if Bortles keeps playing as he did Sunday, the search might not be necessary.
Eight. The number of consecutive games Denver have lost since starting the season 3-1. Given the way the Broncos have tumbled, with a sluggish offense and dreary quarterback play, it’s hard to imagine they once looked like serious contenders to win the AFC West. That was back in early October, right after Denver had beaten Oakland 16-10 and the offense seemed strong enough to win games. Then everything fell apart.
The Broncos, who scored 42 and 28 points in their first two games, have scored more than 20 only once since and as they have bounced between Trevor Siemian, Brock Osweiler and Paxton Lynch at quarterback. None have looked impressive as evidenced by Siemian’s three interceptions in a 35-9 loss to Miami on Sunday. It’s safe to say none of the three will be Denver’s starting quarterback next season. The question is who will? The Broncos defense is too good for this team to be 3-9 less than two years after winning a Super Bowl.
Y’all still craving Pat Mahomes? pic.twitter.com/MpR2j3NAks
Last week, this space wondered if the Kansas City Chiefs would be best served by benching Alex Smith and replacing him with Patrick Mahomes, the quarterback they took with the 10th pick in last spring’s draft. Given the way Smith had failed miserably in third-down situations and given the way the Chiefs had stumbled in the season’s second-half a quarterback change seemed likely.
Instead, Kanas City coach Andy Reid gave up play-calling duties, handing them to offensive coordinator Matt Nagy. Then on Sunday Smith looked more like the Smith of the early season completing 19 of 36 passes for 366 yards and four touchdowns. But most impressive was this 70-yard run that showed off Smith’s speed.
Still, Smith’s performance on Sunday was not enough to keep the Chiefs slide from ending. That’s because …
Marcus Peters loses it. #chiefs pic.twitter.com/QOR7fCe11d
… Kansas City’s defense could not slow the might Jets and so the Chiefs found themselves in an 11-play goalline stand that twice would have held the Jets to a field goal in a one-point game, only to have New York be awarded a fresh shot at the end zone with Chiefs penalties. When the Jets did finally score – barely – to go up by six, a two-point conversion failed. Except Kansas City was called for (what else?) another penalty.
Fed up, Kansas City cornerback Marcus Peters picked up the flag and heaved it into the stands.
The NFL tends to frown upon their players throwing penalty flags, especially because those little yellow handkerchiefs actually have small weights sewn into them. You can laugh and say such a thing could take an eye out, but that almost happened in a game back in 1996 when an official’s flag caught Cleveland’s Orlando Brown in the eye causing Brown to miss the rest of the season.
Fortunately, the flag Peters threw did not hurt anyone. In fact the fans in the stands took selfies of themselves with penalty flag, but the Chiefs were unable to come back, losing their sixth game in seven weeks, 38-31.
“Throw him out!” – Chant from Bills fans aimed at Rob Gronkowski.
The sight of the 265lbs Gronkowski plunging onto the back of a helpless Tre’Davious White as White lay on the ground was shocking. The Bills cornerback clearly not expecting contact, he held the ball he had just intercepted against his stomach and when Gronkowski jumped on him it appeared to knock his breath out.
Gronkowski, who grew up in Buffalo, had reason to be angry, however. White had been holding his jersey on the previous play, keeping him from getting open and allowing the ball to be intercepted. Gronkowski appeared frustrated by the fact no penalty had been called but leaping on a defenseless player was simply dirty – a fact he acknowledged after the game when he apologized for what he did to White.
None of this made a difference in the final score, a 23-3 New England victory, the Pats’ eighth straight win.
--Aaron Jones ran 20 yards for a touchdown in overtime to give Green Bay a 26-20 victory over Tampa Bay and keep the Packers’ flickering playoff hopes alive at 6-6.
--The Baltimore Ravens are back in postseason contention with a 44- 20 victory over Detroit behind Joe Flacco’s 269 passing yards and two touchdowns. Lions quarterback Matthew Stafford left the game with an injured hand in the fourth quarter.
--Atlanta were far from the offensive power of last week as they lost 14-9 at home to Minnesota. Falcons quarterback Matt Ryan had just 173 yards passing as a Super Bowl team from last year fell to 7-5. They are in danger of not making the playoffs.
--Jimmy Garoppolo won his first start as a San Francisco 49er, throwing for 293 yards but no touchdowns as the Niners rode five Robbie Gould field goals in an ugly 15-14 victory over Chicago.
--Marshawn Lynch had his first 100-yard rushing game in two years as Oakland added to the New York Giants misery with a 24-17 victory.


After another victory that seemed inevitable, despite West Ham basically building a wall, then behind it a slightly taller wall on the edge of the penalty area, it’s worth having a look at some records that Manchester City could have their eye on. Beat Manchester United next weekend and they will equal the mark for most consecutive wins (14, by Arsenal in 2002) in the Premier League era. They are nearly halfway to the most wins in a season (30, by Chelsea last term) and well on the way to the points record (95, by Chelsea in 2004-05) and goals record (103, Chelsea again, in 2009-10). A victory over United will put them on 46 points from 16 games, which would have been enough to come eighth last season, and their 46 goals are already more than were managed by the team that did finish in that spot, Southampton. They’re pretty good, really. Nick Miller
Eden Hazard has played the best football of his career under Antonio Conte and it is clear that the Belgian can get even better if he trusts his manager. Conte is a relentless coach and, though he regularly champions Hazard’s talent, the Italian was quick to point out that the world’s finest players make their names on the biggest stages. Hazard excelled in Chelsea’s 3-1 win over Newcastle United, scoring twice, but the forward has been challenged to aim even higher than destroying Premier League defences. “I don’t think that Eden is at the peak of his career,” Conte said. “It’s important for him to work, work, work in every training session to improve himself. You are at the top when you win the Ballon d’Or the first time, when you win the Champions League, when you win the Word Cup. At that moment you are at the top of the world.” Jacob Steinberg
Arsène Wenger seemed a bit vexed trying to explain the slightly paradoxical nature of Arsenal’s loss to Manchester United because he had seen something very positive from his team’s attacking waves, yet it was all overshadowed by the result. One theme that has emerged in the last week, over the home games against Huddersfield and United, is how Alexandre Lacazette has taken a big step in his integration. Wenger took a cautious approach with his record signing in the first part of the season, rather puzzlingly holding off on starts and regularly substituting the French striker. The match against United was his first complete 90 minutes in the Premier League since the opening day. His adjustment to Arsenal’s game – and his team-mates better reading of his excellent movement – has taken time but he now looks totally involved and pivotal to the way Wenger wants his team to attack. Amy Lawrence
With Davinson Sánchez likely to miss three matches as a result of the straight red card he received for throwing his arm into Richarlison’s face, Spurs are facing a defensive shortage. Toby Aldeweireld has suggested he could be out for as long as four months with injury, while Cameron Carter-Vickers is on loan at Sheffield United with no recall option. Mauricio Pochettino, therefore, has only Jan Vertonghen and Eric Dier with significant experience at centre-half. On the other hand, Ben Davies has deputised in a back three and there is the Argentinian teenager Juan Foyth, signed from Estudiantes in the summer. Pochettino remained unruffled, though, after watching his team battle for a point at Watford (only their second in four matches). “I am not going to complain if Sánchez will be out for a few games”, he said. “That is football. It is about the squad. If he cannot play we will play with another.” Paul MacInnes
Wayne Rooney gave a display of passing and pointing. His defence-splitting ball led to Dominic Calvert-Lewin’s goal and he also enforced Sam Allardyce’s orders, talking team-mates into position. This authoritative display, coupled with his hat-trick against West Ham three days earlier, came after he had been an unused substitute in the previous two league games. That may not happen again soon. “He produced a good performance today and a brilliant one on Wednesday,” said Allardyce. “So we have to really make sure we get him ready for every game. If we get the physical side of Wayne right then that ability never ever leaves you.” He remains such an admirer of Rooney that it feels possible the stand-in skipper will replace the injured Phil Jagielka as captain. “He has had more criticism in the last couple of years than he has had praise and I think that he has handled that brilliantly,” added Allardyce. Richard Jolly
It was a slightly curious experience watching Liverpool thrash Brighton 5-1. On the one hand their counterattacks were so good they were life-affirming. But on the other you were left with the nagging question: if Liverpool are this good, then why aren’t they better? The win, their fifth in six Premier League games, took them up to fourth, but their vim and quality going forward is that of a side who should be challenging Manchester City. The obvious answer is their defence but the glint of mental fragility that led to them conceding a three-goal lead against Sevilla is a big part of it, too. After the win at the Amex Jürgen Klopp admitted that when Glenn Murray made it 3-1, that game flashed before his eyes. “When you have it once, unfortunately it needs a bit of time to get rid of it completely,” he said. When that speck of doubt is erased, Liverpool will be much stronger. NM
In a poor game at the Bet365 Stadium that served up precious few moments of class, Joe Allen was a shining light with his display in the centre of the Stoke City midfield. The Welshman set up Xherdan Shaqiri’s equaliser with a lovely through ball and was at the heart of Stoke’s more promising moments, with the sort of composure and intelligent passing that deserved a better stage than a scrappy fixture between two uninspiring teams. It was, in summary, an excellent piece of business on Stoke’s part when they signed Allen from Liverpool in the summer before last, and a glaring and unforgivable error from Swansea’s point of view to miss out on him. Allen, after all, had wanted to return to the club that he continues to support. “They’ve got to stick at it and, as a fan now, I’m hoping they do just that,” Allen said about Swansea after Stoke’s 2-1 victory. Stuart James
When Leicester sacked Craig Shakespeare eight games into the season, a few months after he saved them from relegation, it was fair to wonder if the board had acted hastily. Less reasonable was the antipathy that greeted the appointment of Claude Puel. The rules that govern such matters are not scientific, but he had previously led Monaco to a Ligue 1 title and Lyon to the Champions League semi-finals. Then in his first season in England he took Southampton to a final – where they played superbly – and to an eighth-place finish, only to be sacked for football unbefitting the club’s sophisticated tastes. At Leicester, he is extracting the most from Riyad Mahrez, Jamie Vardy, and Demarai Gray – whose talent Shakespeare was not prepared to trust. City, third-bottom when he was appointed, now sit ninth, two places and three points above ... Southampton. Daniel Harris
Ryan Fraser’s biggest challenge has been finding some consistency. If he can perform well regularly, Bournemouth will reap rewards. The Scotland winger’s indifferent form has frustrated himself as much as it has Eddie Howe, so much so that he asked to play for the under-21s against Plymouth Argyle last month to build some confidence. Fraser, a £400,000 signing from Aberdeen four years ago, scored his first league goal of the season against Southampton on Sunday and Howe is hoping that strike will prove significant in the long run. “I’m one of Ryan’s biggest fans,” the Bournemouth manager said. “For whatever reason he’s had a slightly stuttering start to the season. We haven’t seen him at his fluent best. I can’t speak highly enough of his ability as a player. I just hope he can do it on a consistent basis.” Ben Fisher
It was edifying to see some of the best moments of quality from Saturday’s goalless draw between two relegation-threatened teams at The Hawthorns come from a couple of England youngsters promising to make a consistent impact in the Premier League. Ruben Loftus-Cheek, now 21, has long been heralded as the best of Chelsea’s loan stars and is playing without fear despite Crystal Palace only just rising off the foot of the table; Sam Field, 19, has returned to West Brom’s team since Tony Pulis’s dismissal and played three games in an unbeaten week. Recently promoted to the England under-21s after starring for Keith Downing’s Under-20s, the local lad has grace and poise. Outstanding on his recent full senior international debut, Loftus-Cheek is also being edged into a wide role in a compact midfield four for Palace. But while he has licence to roam, he is also willing to track and do some of the dirty work required of that position in a lower-half team. Pete Lansley


An unkind reading would be that the fact West Ham United can take such heart from what was eventually an Alamo‑esque occasion speaks volumes for the position the club find themselves in. That would not be unfair, even if caveats do exist. If David Moyes could not conjure a result up here then the semblance of a platform, a hint of the resilience that has deserted his new charges for so long, would reflect well on everyone involved: he got that at the Etihad and, with a little more quality at either end, might even have left with rather more.
“We’re going to have to try and find a way to see if we can stop them and make it hard for them,” a characteristically phlegmatic Moyes had asserted before the teams emerged. At that point City’s Tunnel Club concept appeared particularly ghoulish: a safari package for those with deep pockets prepared to watch doe-eyed prey lining up before the grisliest of slaughters. Moyes knew what the rest of us did: he had probably not read the apocalyptic projections that City might trouble the Premier League’s record winning margin, and was presumably ignorant of odds favouring an 8-0 home win above a single-goal win for his side but he was certainly aware of West Ham’s absentee list and had, more to the point, seen both sides play this season.
What followed, then, must have seemed a trick of the light. Moyes dropped Marko Arnautovic – who had seemed a viable candidate for a post‑match Pep Guardiola rollocking – from the starting XI, preferring a team chiefly composed of yeomen and make‑dos. They included the 18-year‑old centre-back Declan Rice, who stood in for the stricken Winston Reid and was described by his manager as “a really enthusiastic, good type”. The surprise was that everyone in a West Ham side whose application has routinely fallen well short this season could, on this evidence alone, fit that definition. Rice’s zeal brought an early booking but it was an isolated piece of panic in a composed opening period that, aside from the obvious inconvenience of seeing far less of the ball against opponents who can work miracles with it, saw them pose more difficulties than they faced.
The lone front man, Michail Antonio, could have exposed City’s set-piece weakness at the far post and then was not a million miles from converting a cross by Arthur Masuaku, whose willingness to plough the tramlines has made him an early Moyes favourite. As half-time approached a 20-yard drive from David Silva had been the only real cause of alarm; the minutes were drifting by and any onlookers watching play bereft of context could have been forgiven for finding it all a touch stodgy.
In fact the lack of activity, of lightning-quick interchanges from City or gross pieces of defensive neglect from West Ham, made things all the more fascinating. A 90-minute slog of nothing could, for Moyes, end up meaning absolutely everything. Angelo Ogbonna’s opener, when it came, did not actually seem a huge surprise. It played to the adage that a team operating at less than full pelt is liable to the sucker punch against anyone; Aaron Cresswell’s cross was pinpoint and the thumping header that met it ensured that those leering through the glass bore witness to an entirely different colour of wounded beast on the walk back in.
West Ham’s performance was, at this point, straight out of the textbook. The danger was that City, ears warmed by a manager who had flung a water bottle away in disgust when the goal went in, would almost certainly not be this casual again. Another risk, equally telling, had suggested itself shortly before Ogbonna scored: it was a blow to see Cheikhou Kouyaté, who appeared to tweak his hamstring, depart with the latest in a seemingly endless line of muscle injuries to affect West Ham players and the obvious question was whether their fitness, shown to be inadequate during the latter days of Slaven Bilic, could really face an examination turned up a few notches.
In the end it could not and a visibly tiring West Ham, forced deeper and deeper as the second half progressed and unable to make use of the tiring Antonio’s bustle, brought on to themselves a degree of pressure that never looked likely to end well. Moyes felt Rice should have dealt with the ball from Kevin De Bruyne, beautifully weighted though it was, that created the winning goal just as it appeared Nicolás Otamendi’s equaliser might be the only damage. It seemed particularly harsh that David Silva should score so soon after West Ham, on a rare sortie, had almost forced a second goal of their own through an angled Antonio shot that Ederson repelled sharply. Eventually, though, minds and bodies were not quite fresh enough to hold out.
“When you play the top teams you’re going to have to do it for 90 minutes – not 60, not 70, but 90,” Moyes pointed out afterwards. Diafra Sakho would have altered that sentiment had he not blazed wide at the end when teed up by Arnautovic. The manager had set his team up pragmatically, not negatively, and West Ham had shown an appetite to attack when they could.
The nagging concern is that, on a one-off occasion with scant expectation, credit is easier to come by than it might seem: the real test is how West Ham now perform on an everyday basis – whether the steel that they showed here can be matched by the style that wins points rather than compliments for pluck. Then the positives would look far more substantial.


Sam Allardyce believes Gylfi Sigurdsson has struggled to cope with the pressure of playing for Everton and the manager plans to bring in a sports psychologist to address the mental frailties of his new charges.
The Icelander became Everton’s £45m club record buy, making him £17m more expensive than any previous signing at Goodison Park, when he arrived from Swansea in August and Allardyce feels he has found it difficult to adjust to the demands of life at a higher-profile club.
Sigurdsson, who scored just his third goal for his new club in Saturday’s 2-0 win against Huddersfield Town, had a two-season spell at Tottenham Hotspur before rejoining Swansea City but he was not burdened with the expectation that comes with such a huge price tag during his days at White Hart Lane. Allardyce thinks the transfer has brought a culture shock to the player who recorded the third most assists in the Premier League last season but who, because of his cost, has become the face of Everton’s £140m summer recruitment drive.
“It is a big club,” he explained. “No disrespect to Swansea, you are playing on a bigger stage so you have to have a greater mentality to come out and produce because the demand is higher to play for Everton.
“All fans want entertaining but they want to see a level of ability, too. It is big pressure and a lot of the other players who have come from abroad because of the start of the season, [and] the Europa League, it has not given them a real opportunity to settle in and be able to produce at Everton so that is a disappointment.”
Sigurdsson’s protracted move was finally completed on 16 August, depriving him of a pre-season with his new team-mates, and he had also missed Swansea’s summer tour amid uncertainty about his future. Allardyce is convinced that rendered his start more difficult.
“Gylfi came so late because of the ongoing saga of ‘How much will he be and will Swansea let him go? Will they or won’t they?’” he said. “In that time he wasn’t really training with the first team and it wasn’t happening for him in terms of a full pre-season. So he is on catch-up.”
Everton have seen only glimpses of Sigurdsson’s ability amid a continuing debate about how to accommodate him and Wayne Rooney. The Icelander opened his account for his new club from 50 yards against Hajduk Split and scored again in spectacular style against Southampton last Sunday. A closer-range strike against Huddersfield had a rarity value.
If he ranks as Everton’s most expensive underachiever this season, he is far from the only one. While Huddersfield were defeated in part because of Allardyce’s half-time rejig, his initial work has been concentrated more on the psychological than the tactical.
Everton have endured the worst European group campaign of any English club and briefly dropped into the relegation zone in a traumatic start to the season under Ronald Koeman. While the caretaker David Unsworth had selected the side for Wednesday’s 4-0 win over West Ham, Allardyce has sought to engineer improvement. “I just had five minutes and talked about a few pointers about how you get better,” he added.
He has forged a reputation as both a man-manager and a motivator but has always been willing to call upon experts in specific fields. “Eventually there will not only be us who deliver psychologically, in terms of wanting to make the players stronger mentally,” he said.
“I would actually try and find them a sports psychologist because I think that will be very important. If the brain is clear and positive before the lads go out, then they produce a positive performance. If the brain is clouded and doubtful, you don’t see the player produce the abilities he has got. That has obviously been seen on a couple of occasions here with the lack of confidence from the lack of results. But there is nothing better than two wins on the trot.”


For years the Pontiac Silverdome has been one of America’s most famous ruins, a shadow of the arena that once hosted the pope, a Super Bowl and the World Cup.
On Sunday, the demolition of Detroits’s 80,000-capacity arena began with a partial implosion that was supposed to bring down the structure’s upper section, the first part of a process expected to take up to a year.
However, when the explosives were detonated very little happened, apart from a few puffs of smoke. Demolition company Adamo said 10% of the charges failed to go off. The building should still fall, it said – it was just unclear when.
“At some point, gravity is gonna take over, one of these sections is gonna go and it’s gonna rip everything with it. Everything is gonna come down,” Kevin Lindke, the project superintendent, told Michigan Live.
“If it doesn’t go, we’ll come back and we’ll either reload it or we’ll hook some cables and we’ll pull it down.”
The Pontiac Silverdome did not implode this morning. I guess the building is not used to implosion on a Sunday until 1 pm.
The Silverdome, 30 miles north-west of downtown Detroit, was first hailed as one of the world’s best sporting venues. But for many its eventual abandonment became a symbol of the decline of south-east Michigan, an area hurt by the decline of the auto industry.
Photographs of the decaying building became famous around the world; this year’s Transformers film used the stadium to portray a post-apocalyptic wasteland.
Until 2001, the Silverdome was home to the NFL’s Detroit Lions, a team known for underperformance – they have not won a championship since 1957. On Sunday, the Silverdome’s fate was inevitably linked to the Lions’ failings.
“The Pontiac Silverdome did not implode this morning. I guess the building is not used to implosion on a Sunday until 1 pm,” wrote the retired Detroit sports journalist Terry Foster on Twitter.


Gareth Southgate has been told he will keep his job even if England lose all their group stage matches at Russia 2018, according to the FA chief executive, Martin Glenn, who gave him an overwhelming public vote of confidence.
The backlash would be considerable if England do not find their way out of Group G containing Belgium, Tunisia and the World Cup debutants Panama. But Glenn insisted even failure to reach the knockout stages of the tournament would not automatically spell the end for Southgate.
“Gareth has a long-term contract,” said Glenn. “He’s not looking at Russia as a free pass. The World Cup’s a really important staging post for our development, I think. We go out there wanting to win it but also being realistic. No one wants to have a bad World Cup but we’re confident he’s the right guy to take us through for the next few tournaments.”
Glenn pointed to England’s recent age-group success, including victories at the Under-17 and Under-20 World Cups, as a reason why there would be no kneejerk reaction even if the senior team fail to get out of the group for a second consecutive World Cup. “We’re going to do it in a way that’s sustainable. So we’re going to make sure that we’re picking the kind of players that can do their best in Russia and continue to kick on in 2020 and 2022.
“What we’re doing is making sure that players that have made it through to the first team by 21, 22, have had lots and lots of tournament experience. So those under-17 winners and under-20 winners will be coming through and they are serious competitions to win. We know that worked for the Germans and we know that worked for the Spanish, so we’re just repeating things they’ve done with our own emphasis on it.”
Southgate was appointed on a four-year contract in November 2016 after Sam Allardyce’s one-game, 67-day reign ended following a newspaper sting. Before him Roy Hodgson resigned after four years when England suffered a humiliating defeat to Iceland, which sent them out of Euro 2016. Glenn said recent underwhelming performances at major championships had tempered expectations on the current team.
“After three disappointing tournaments, come back to a proud nation,” he said. “Wherever we go, a performance at the World Cup that’s created a buzz, got people excited. For me, it’s recreate the excitement that a lot of us remember from the past but, probably, a generation of people haven’t really experienced. I think that’ll be brilliant.”
England avoided teams such as Germany and Brazil in Friday’s draw at Moscow’s State Kremlin Palace but Glenn refused to subscribe to the idea that it was the best draw England could have hoped for. “I don’t think any draw’s a dream draw,” he said. “We are up against one of the top teams in the world in Belgium. They’re ranked four or five. We know a bit about Tunisia. I think we played them in the first game in the ’98 World Cup. We’ve never played Panama so we need to get prepared for those games.
“There was definitely a [possible] group of death but no one got it. And no one got an absolute patsy draw either. History says the small teams in the World Cup refuse to play like small teams.”


Swansea City’s calamitous season is going from bad to worse after it emerged their players turned on one another in a heated row in the wake of their chastening defeat at Stoke City. The disappointment and frustration that has been building for weeks spilled over in an angry confrontation that could be heard outside the changing room following yet another damaging result.
Stoke’s 2-1 victory on Saturday condemned Swansea to their ninth Premier League defeat in 12 matches, increasing the pressure on Paul Clement, who delivered a scathing assessment of his team’s performances so far this season after they slipped to the bottom of the table.
Although Clement retains the support of the club’s board ahead of next Saturday’s home game against West Bromwich Albion, with the owners hopeful that results can improve in time to allow the coach a chance to strengthen the squad in the January transfer window, the problems are piling up on and off the pitch after the scenes in the dressing room at Stoke.
It is understood that some players have privately questioned the level of commitment of a few of their team-mates for a while, and the manner of the defeat at Stoke appears to have been a tipping point when it comes to airing grievances. Although Swansea got off to the perfect start when Wilfried Bony scored early on, the hosts exposed their fragile confidence with two goals in the space of four minutes just before the interval.
Martin Olsson, the Swansea left-back, described the exchanges in the dressing room as “heated” and admitted it had reached a stage where players needed to speak their minds. “Now it’s time to get tough and if you need to dig some players out, you need to dig some players out,” Olsson said. “It’s time for us to be men and go and fight on the pitch. When we conceded the first goal, most of the heads go down and we’re not playing as aggressive. It cannot happen. We need to be stronger mentally, much stronger, because it’s going to be a long season.
“[Saturday] was one of those days where some frustration came out in the dressing room but it happens in a good way – and it had to happen. We’re still behind each other, there’s some stuff we need to work on.”
Asked to elaborate on the verbal exchanges, Olsson said: “Of course it gets a bit heated but in a good way. We all need to wake up as a team and we need to run for each other, create chances, offensively, defensively, like the end of last season.”
Olsson went on to say that the blame for Swansea’s results rests with the players and not Clement. “The manager told us what to do. We need to listen to him. We knew there was going to be a long ball in and we had to deal with it [for Stoke’s second goal], and of course the first goal the ball was given away [by Leroy Fer]. Simple, silly mistakes – it’s frustrating.”


A French midfielder with massive presence sent off in an intense match between Manchester United and Arsenal reflected on his emotions in the dressing room, mind whirring while the latter stages of the game was played without him. “It’s tough, especially in a big moment like that,” he said. “You feel like you let the team down. There are so many emotions going through your mind, and everything is negative – I was so mad about the red card.” As it happens, those words belong to Patrick Vieira, who experienced the frustration of being dismissed – unfairly in his view – in a simmering encounter at Old Trafford in 2003.
Like Vieira on that heated day, the result ended up favourable enough for Paul Pogba this weekend to ensure the immediate vexation was not punished, as his team-mates maintained a meaningful result without him. But the aftermath brings added complications. For club and player, suspension for this weekend’s showdown against Manchester City, plus a couple more games on top, is a bitter pill.
Pogba’s influence during United’s win at Arsenal was immense. His charisma, when he got on the ball with some space to influence opening up in front of his eyes, was a major factor. David de Gea’s goalkeeping masterclass and Jesse Lingard’s cleverly timed runs to finish ruthlessly merited glowing praise. But of the game’s many pivotal moments, the killer blow came when United were being swamped by opponents cranking up their attack in search of an equaliser.
Counter time. Pogba marauded down the right channel and when he picked up the ball he beat Laurent Koscielny with a blend of muscle and delicate footwork before clipping over a perfect invitation of a cross that Lingard accepted with delight. There is no obvious replacement for Pogba, especially for a team under pressure in a high-profile game, a situation designed for players with big-match personality to make a difference. It is hard to imagine he will not be missed whatever plan José Mourinho comes up with to try to halt the runaway neighbours.
Many details created this humdinger of a match. There was enough going on that it felt like several games within one 90 minutes. Weighty analysis is justified about everything from Arsenal’s sloppy defending, De Gea’s extraordinary double save, the weird statistical contrast between the expected goals and the real scoreline, the way Arsène Wenger’s team created so many chances in a big game (and indeed the efficacy of United’s defence in allowing themselves to be so open even if they got away with it), Alexandre Lacazette’s improvement now that a rapport with his team-mates has bedded in, a couple of penalty decisions, and Pogba’s dismissal.
One of the compliments Mourinho paid his team afterwards was about their adaptability. They began with the snappy energy to surprise anyone who suspected a bus parking operation had been ordered, spearing Arsenal slips with an impressively sharp edge. Then they had to hang on. Finally, the way they reorganised when Pogba was sent off after the full weight of his stride landed on Héctor Bellerín’s legs was an example of how to force an opponent to drop their tempo and lose their rhythm.
Mourinho was not minded to get into whether a thrilling away performance has any impact on the title scenario. Wenger confronted the same question, phrased in reference to Mauricio Pochettino’s admission that Tottenham are no longer considering themselves involved in any kind of race for top spot.
“I am not Pochettino, I am Arsène Wenger. I am here to fight as long as I can, as long as mathematically it’s possible you have to fight, you cannot give any other message out,” he said. “I believe the game [against Manchester United] has to make us angry and even more determined. If I am a player, and I think with what we produced, we have a huge potential. And we lose the game? We cannot accept that. That’s what you want.”
Wenger was hurting and angry, reeling about the lack of efficiency that affected them at both ends of the pitch, and said that his players felt the same way. “I feel sorry for the players, that’s why I’m angry … When the performance is of that quality we have to be efficient. We are in this job to be efficient, you know. So I blame myself first. We have lost games here against Man United where we didn’t deserve anything. But what makes you angry is that you produce that performance and in the end you have nothing to show for it. De Gea is an outstanding goalkeeper, I don’t want to take anything away. But we had situations, despite De Gea, we should have scored.”
On that note, even in their victory United will have to ponder their own plan considering free-scoring Manchester City have the form to be more ruthless in front of goal. They might need something extra than leaning on a miracle from De Gea to underpin them again.


For a manager who has bounced out of a European Championship at the hands of Iceland and gone back into the Premier League, Roy Hodgson knows all about survival. But if he keeps Crystal Palace up this season, he admits this will be his greatest escape.
Fulham looked dead and buried in 2007-08 when Hodgson followed a mediocre first four months by winning the final three games to stay up. West Bromwich Albion were nose-diving when he arrived at the Hawthorns in February 2011 but finished 11th.
Both of those achievements led to glory – Fulham reaching the Europa League final two years later; Hodgson leaving West Brom for England – but if Palace can maintain their promising recovery to survive after losing their first seven games of the season, he may yet have topped the lot.
“It probably would be, funnily enough,” he said after gaining a welcome 0-0 draw on a heart-warming first return to the Hawthorns on Saturday. “That was a great escape [at Fulham] but the seven games, zero points, is probably as big a shot in the foot as you are ever going to get in the Premier League, so if we can avoid relegation having done that – nothing will detract from my memories with Fulham Football Club and the wonderful memories here, but I hope I will leave Crystal Palace one day with the same type of feeling for the club and the job I was able to do as I was for Fulham and West Brom.”
The neutral arrived at the Hawthorns to assess Alan Pardew’s immediate impact at Albion but left admiring Hodgson’s. So did both sets of fans, as well, as they chanted his name in unison at the end. “It was unusual to get both sets of fans applauding you,” Hodgson agreed.
Palace have now mustered 10 points from eight games to climb off the foot of the table, reflecting a momentum and typical Hodgson organisation that could yet lead to the kind of recovery that earned Tony Pulis the award for manager of the year with the London club four years ago.
Hodgson even has Christian Benteke and Wilfried Zaha working hard out of possession, something both managers praised, and Palace are difficult to break down while threatening to recover the attacking penetration missing on their travels stretching back 10 away games, a Premier League record.
As Hodgson was welcomed back to his old club and appreciated by his new, Pardew made a promising bow in his new home while getting brickbats from his ex. “Alan Pardew, it’s all about you,” sang the travelling Palace fans, choosing to remember the terrible league form of 2016 over the run to the FA Cup final.
Pulis’s successor not only achieved Albion’s first clean sheet in 10 games, he even had them passing the ball through the thirds as they finished the stronger, Salomon Rondon heading narrowly wide seven minutes from time.
Pardew went with three forwards, intent on sending a message to players and supporters that Albion can play on the front foot, even if they were better in a 4-4-2 shape after the interval. He successfully implemented a better transition when out of possession – “We stopped Palace second half from creating anything,” he said. “It’s from that platform that your flair players can go and win the game [in future]” – and knows that confidence to play a faster possession game will come with results.
“You’ve got to remember that we were playing against a Roy Hodgson team and they were very well drilled,” Pardew said. “They’re a better team than the league table suggests. So they made it difficult. There were moments when we’d like to have had a bit more composure in your pass and your movement but it was a decent performance.”
Pardew has several key players due to return from injury as he targets the nine or 10 wins required to stay up while Hodgson, who could name only five substitutes after the late withdrawals of Wayne Hennessey and Scott Dann following a nightmare train journey from London, is confident he has the requisite strength in depth to make a good fist of a survival bid. He may need to; reports of an imminent announcement of ground redevelopment may keep the purse strings tight.
“We are still down there,” he said. “I shan’t be happy until the spectre of relegation is a distant memory and that is going to be a long time ahead.”
He hopes both clubs avoid relegation and sees hope from above. “I think there are teams further up the table who come May might find themselves in a more difficult position than West Bromwich Albion,” Hodgson said.


When you’re on a team once hailed as Super Bowl contenders now mired in an extended slump it’s understandable if tempers are frayed. On Sunday, Kansas City’s cornerback Marcus Peters snapped.
MARCUS PETERS THREW A PENALTY FLAG INTO THE STANDS pic.twitter.com/VQbbqnPSiO
The Chiefs had leapt to an early 14-0 against the New York Jets on Sunday but the Jets battled back to take the lead late in the fourth quarter, thanks in part to a series of penalties called against the Chiefs. The Jets’ two-point conversion attempt – which would have taken them to a 38-31 lead – appeared to have failed until an official threw a flag for defensive holding. That prompted Peters to pick up the flag and hurl it into the crowd – to the delight on one fan who caught it. Peters then walked off the field and into the tunnel before officials could eject him.

Except it turned out that Peters had not been ejected and he soon returned to the field with no socks. It appeared he had thrown his gloves away too.
The Chiefs could not rally and have now lost six of their last seven games after starting the season 5-0 and beating the reigning champion New England Patriots in their opening game. There was some shreds of comfort in the game for Kansas City: quarterback Alex Smith threw for four touchdowns and ran for 70 yards after a receiving criticism for his uninspiring play as the Chiefs’ slump set in.


Even Rickie Fowler’s stunning closing round of 61, which claimed the Hero World Challenge by four shots, was not enough to switch the narrative. Even Tiger Woods’s Sunday 68, meaning three sub-70 rounds out of four, failed to be as significant as what came later.
Woods, in the immediate aftermath of his first completed tournament in 12 months, declared his intention to play regularly in 2018. He even, tantalisingly, touched upon his desire to add to a majors haul which currently sits – and seemed destined to close – at 14. Tiger’s back?
“I don’t know what my schedule’s going to be but my expectations are we’ll be playing next year,” Woods said. “How many, where, I don’t know yet, but we’ll figure it out.
“We’re going to figure out what’s the best way for me to build my schedule for the major championships. Play, how much, what my training cycles are going to be, and play enough but don’t play too much. I don’t know what golf courses I’ll be playing and what’s the best way to go about it. We’ll sit down with the whole team and we’ll figure it out – where I’m going to start, how much I’m going to play, rest periods, training cycles, the whole nine yards.”
Woods reacted impressively from a third round of 75. He reached the Sunday turn in 31 for the second time in this event, as assisted by an eagle at the 7th. He double-bogeyed the 10th – his only such score all week – before going on to produce birdies at 11, 14 and 15. Even back-to-back bogeys to finish could not douse Woods’s upbeat mood.
Somehow, this comeback feels different. Woods’s aggregate of eight under par saw him defeat Justin Thomas, the US PGA champion, the world No1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, who holds the US Open. Crucially, Woods did not display physical impairment during any point in the tournament.
“It was a very good week,” he added. “I’m excited. This is the way I’ve been playing at home and when I came out here and played, I was playing very similar. I wasn’t quite hitting it as far at home but I had the adrenaline going here. Overall I’m very pleased.”
Fowler had started day four at seven under, the same number adrift of Charley Hoffman. A stunning run of seven birdies in as many holes from the 1st catapulted the Californian up the leaderboard. Conditions were at their most favourable of the four days, with 15 of the 18-man field under par, but Fowler’s charge still provided an extraordinary end to this golfing year. This marked his lowest round as a professional, with the winning total identical to 2016 at 18 under par. Woods, who knows a bit about this kind of thing, hailed Fowler’s showing as “phenomenal”.
Fowler said: “I took five weeks off after the Presidents Cup so I was coming here really trying to rely on my year. It was nice for my game to hang around.
“Hopefully this leads to something special in 2018. I can’t put myself this far back going into last rounds, 61s don’t pop up all the time. There are areas that can still get better to help me on the weekends to step up and make things happen.”
Hoffman, who started the final round holding a five-shot lead, finished two clear in second courtesy of a 72. Tommy Fleetwood will be married in the Bahamas ; he heads to the altar in fine fettle after a 67 for a share of third alongside Jordan Spieth. Justin Rose’s 70 meant a share of fifth.
Sky Sports is on the verge of agreeing a new deal to cover the Masters, thereby allaying fears the subscription channel could lose a second major championship. In what marked an embarrassment for Sky after the launch of a dedicated golf station last year, it was subsequently unable to agree a package for the US PGA Championship which, in turn, was covered live in the UK by the BBC.
It emerged last summer that Sky’s Masters contract had ended in 2017 without immediate renewal. Augusta National’s senior figures subsequently tested the market by way of talks with BT Sport during the Open Championship.
But it has emerged Sky has all-but confirmed an extension with Augusta which will, as per typical Masters partnerships, not be on a multiyear basis. “We work on short-term contracts with all of our broadcast partners,” said an Augusta source.
An interesting caveat to that is Sky’s continuing pursuit of exclusive Masters rights in the UK, with the BBC currently covering the last two days of the event on a live basis. Whether the corporation can retain that Augusta alliance with Sky hovering remains to be seen. Augusta, as was the case with the R&A with regards the Open Championship, would face a public backlash if its event was removed from free-to-air television.
What happens next with the US PGA will also come under further attention. As things stand, Sky has made no serious bid to reclaim the fourth major of the year. It may well be that commercial attention was focused on the Masters, while industry sources have suggested Sky may place more value in the US PGA from 2019, when it moves to a slot in May. The BBC’s coverage of last year’s event was widely criticised, albeit it was secured at short notice and in direct scheduling competition to the World Athletics Championships.
Jordan Spieth, meanwhile, has reflected on a year in which he added the Open to his collection of majors. The Texan, now a three-times major champion, rounded off 2017 at the Hero World Challenge in the Bahamas on Sunday.
“The Open has a pretty significant worldwide reach,” Spieth said. “It’s my second favourite tournament in the world behind the Masters. So to win those and a Ryder Cup – which I put kind of in a different place – and the US Open, they are kind of top four events in my mind that I can win in my lifetime and that I’ve done that, it’s extremely satisfying. So I look at the year as a whole as a huge, tremendous success. This was one of the better years that I’ll ever have.”
In a further nod to television, and the pull of Tiger Woods, Golf Channel viewing figures for day one of the Hero World Challenge increased by 27% from 2017. On Thursday afternoon, as Woods made a first start in 10 months, the channel was the most watched cable sports network in the US.


Aaron Jones’ 20-yard touchdown run on his only carry, with 5:59 left in overtime, gave the Green Bay Packers a 26-20 win Sunday over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.
With the passing game struggling, Green Bay (6-6) wore down the Buccaneers on the ground. Brett Hundley had runs of 18 and seven yards on the drive to start overtime.
The Packers grinded out a win to stay in the playoff race, though they trail NFC North leader Minnesota by four games. They hope to get starting quarterback Aaron Rodgers back from a collarbone injury in a couple of weeks.
Jameis Winston threw two touchdown passes to Cameron Brate in the quarterback’s shaky return from a shoulder injury. But the defense couldn’t hold up in overtime for the last-place Buccaneers (4-8)
Rex Burkhead scored twice and the New England Patriots won their eighth straight by beating the Buffalo Bills 23-3, continuing their dominance over their AFC East rival.
Tom Brady went 21 of 30 for 258 yards and an interception, while improving to 27-3 over Buffalo and breaking Brett Favre’s NFL record for most wins by a quarterback against any one opponent. Favre had 26 wins over Detroit.
Brady needed to simply stand aside and let the Patriots’ rejuvenated rushing attack wear down the Bills in a game New England never trailed. Dion Lewis had 92 yards rushing and Burkhead had 78.
The Patriots built a 9-3 lead on Stephen Gostkowski’s three field goals in the first half, including a 50-yarder. Burkhead then took over in the second half by capping New England’s first two drives with one- and 14-yard touchdown runs. New England (10-2) won their 14th consecutive road game the second-longest streak in NFL history and reached double-digits in victories for the 15th consecutive season. New England also improved to 30-5 against Buffalo since Patriots coach Bill Belichick was hired in 2000.
Robbie Gould kicked a 24-yard field goal in the closing seconds, Jimmy Garoppolo threw for 293 yards in his first San Francisco start, and the 49ers beat the Chicago Bears 15-14.
Gould made five field goals in his first appearance at Soldier Field since Chicago cut him prior to the 2016 opener. The Bears’ all-time leader in points and field goals made, he shouted at their sideline after he nailed the winner.
Garoppolo was solid in his first start since the 49ers (2-10) acquired him from New England before the trade deadline in October. The suburban Chicago product completed 26 of 37 passes with an interception. And the 49ers picked up the win after losing their first five road games.
Chicago (3-9) dropped their fifth straight, and coach John Fox fell to 12-32 in three seasons with the Bears. Mitchell Trubisky was 12 of 15 for 102 yards and a touchdown.
Tarik Cohen returned a punt 61 yards for a touchdown. That made him the first NFL rookie with rushing, receiving, passing and punt return TDs in a season since Gale Sayers in 1965
Case Keenum threw a pair of touchdown passes, and the Minnesota Vikings extended their winning streak to eight straight games, keeping the Atlanta Falcons out of the end zone in a 14-9 victory.
Keenum, who was 25 of 30 for 227 yards, hooked up with Jerick McKinnon on a two-yard scoring play in the second quarter and went to Kyle Rudolph for a six-yard TD on the first snap of the fourth quarter , capping an 89-yard drive that consumed more than eight minutes. Minnesota (10-2) turned in a stellar defensive effort against a Falcons team that led the league in scoring a year ago and seemed to be finding its stride during a three-game winning streak, averaging nearly 32 points.
The Falcons were held without a touchdown for the first time since December 2015, when they were blanked 38-0 by Carolina. Matt Ryan’s streak of 30 straight games with a TD pass also ended, going down as the eighth-longest in NFL history.
Josh McCown scored on a one-yard quarterback sneak with 2:15 left, and the New York Jets bounced back from a brutal start to hold on for a wild and wacky 38-31 win over the Kansas City Chiefs.
Chandler Catanzaro kicked a 21-yard field goal to put the Jets (5-7) ahead with 3:55 left. But Kansas City’s Bennie Logan was called for a personal foul for hitting long snapper Thomas Hennessy on the play. That gave the Jets the ball at the one with a new set of downs.
After two running plays, McCown threw incomplete but Steven Nelson was penalized for defensive holding, making it first-and-goal from the two. Three plays later, McCown kept the ball and shoved his way into the end zone.
McCown’s pass on the two-point conversion was incomplete, but Nelson was called for holding. An enraged Marcus Peters picked up the penalty flag and tossed it away, drawing an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty. Elijah McGuire ran it in moments later to convert the two-point play and make it 38-31.
McCown finished with 331 yards passing and a touchdown to Matt Forte, and ran for two scores including the winner. Jermaine Kearse had nine catches for 157 yards and Robby Anderson caught eight passes for 107 yards as the Jets dominated in time of possession, but still had to hold their breath in the end.
Blake Bortles threw two touchdown passes, Leonard Fournette scored for the first time in six weeks and the Jacksonville Jaguars beat the Indianapolis Colts 30-10, sweeping the series for the second time since they joined the AFC South in 2002.
The Jaguars (8-4) bounced back from a last-second loss at Arizona, reached eight wins for the first time since 2010 and remained in the thick of the playoff picture. Bortles, Fournette and some more trickery had a lot to do with the latest victory. Bortles completed 26 of 35 passes for 309 yards, with TD passes to Marqise Lee and Keelan Cole.
Joe Flacco threw for 269 yards and two touchdowns, and the Baltimore Ravens survived a strong comeback bid by Matthew Stafford and the Detroit Lions in a 44-20 victory.
After relying heavily on their opportunistic defense for much of the season, the Ravens (7-5) finally received an ample contribution from the league’s 31st-ranked offense.
Flacco helped Baltimore take a 20-0 halftime lead and directed three scoring drives in the fourth quarter to keep the Ravens in front. Flacco completed 23 of 36 passes while guiding an offense that did not commit a turnover.
Stafford completed a team-record 20 straight passes in the second half, twice getting the Lions within a touchdown. But Detroit (6-6) lost a second straight following a three-game winning streak.
LeShaun Sims intercepted a pass intended for DeAndre Hopkins in the end zone with 1:02 left, and the Tennessee Titans beat the Houston Texans 24-13 to stay atop the AFC South.
Marcus Mariota also ran for a touchdown and threw for another, but the Titans needed the interception to preserve the win with Tom Savage throwing for a career-high 365 yards despite the Texans losing four offensive players to injuries during the game.
The Titans (8-4) won their second straight and sixth of their past seven. They improved to 4-1 in the AFC South to stay ahead of Jacksonville, a winner over Indianapolis.
Xavien Howard’s 30-yard interception return for a touchdown highlighted a dominating defensive effort by the Miami Dolphins, and they snapped a five-game losing streak Sunday with a 35-9 victory over the Denver Broncos, who lost their eighth in a row.
Miami scored two safeties in a game for the first time in franchise history and held Denver to 1 for 13 on third-down conversions. Trevor Siemian, the Broncos’ third starting quarterback in as many weeks, went 20 for 42 for 219 yards with three interceptions.
Kenyan Drake rushed for 120 yards for Miami on 23 carries, both career highs. He scored on a 42-yard touchdown run only the Dolphins’ second rush for a TD this year.
Miami (5-7) won for the first time since Week 7, while the Broncos (3-9) went from bad to worse, extending their longest skid in 50 years. Howard scored on the first interception by a Miami boundary cornerback all season, and added another pick in the fourth quarter to set up the Dolphins’ final touchdown.


Pep Guardiola praised Manchester City’s increasing ability to win in “Fergie time” after West Ham United were beaten by David Silva’s 83rd-minute strike, to make it three successive matches his side have served up a late, late show in the manner of Manchester United under Sir Alex Ferguson.
The victory was a 13th straight league win, to equal the all-time single‑season top-flight record most recently achieved by Arsenal in 2001-02- and Chelsea last term as Guardiola’s side maintained an eight-point lead over United.
After Huddersfield Town and Southampton were beaten in City’s previous two games thanks to Raheem Sterling’s strikes, the City manager was asked if his side now have their own version of “Fergie time”.
Guardiola said: “If we can take something about the Fergie time, it is welcome, a pleasure. I heard about the Fergie time. I was not here in that period but of course you have to have that. What we show in the last games is we never give up. The opponent doesn’t want to play. They just want to defend. I understand. I am not judging but it is difficult. Always they have 10 players behind the ball. Hopefully in the future opponents can want to play. Today I learned a bit like a manager to tackle it different. We don’t normally play with two strikers and two wingers but we did so it is a lesson.”
City had fallen behind to Angelo Ogbonna’s header 60 seconds before the break but Nicolás Otamendi equalised on 57 minutes before Silva struck.
While City next play United at Old Trafford in Sunday’s 175th Manchester derby, West Ham’s defeat means David Moyes has claimed only one point from his four matches in charge. Yet despite his team being second bottom on 10 points, three adrift of the last safe spot, he is not contemplating relegation. “I always think we will get away. I don’t think we will be in trouble,” Moyes said. “I think we have a good team, good players. I thought the effort and energy of the players will give us a real chance.
“I really want the football to be attacking but we are playing against a team that we can hardly get the ball so what are you going to do? There will be a lot of teams will find it a struggle to get the ball off them,” he said.


Cricket isn’t cricket without the occasional “rain stopped play” that has marked – not often enough for English taste – the Ashes test in Adelaide. But rain is not the only reason why cricket matches sometimes have to be halted. Snow, dazzling sunshine and a solar eclipse have all brought games to an early end. So have hedgehogs, pigs, snakes and cars on the pitch. But cricket’s love of the eccentric gave way to a truly disturbing interruption on Sunday when Delhi’s bad air pollution – which was 15 times the WHO’s recommended toxicity maximum – caused stops and starts to a test between India and Sri Lanka. With players forced to leave the game to vomit and Sri Lankans wearing anti-pollution masks on the field, this was a Delhi clean-up call. If India’s favourite sport can’t be played in the nation’s smog-laden capital, cricket in Delhi should be no-balled.


Hull City have parted company with manager Leonid Slutsky by mutual consent, the Championship club have announced.
Slutsky, 46, who replaced Marco Silva at the KCom Stadium in June, has won only four of his 19 league games in charge.
Saturday’s draw at Sheffield Wednesday left the Tigers, relegated from the Premier League last season, 20th in the table, three points above the bottom three. The club’s head of strategy, Oleg Yarovinsky, who only arrived on Humberside in October, has departed too.
Slutsky said: “I would like to really thank everyone associated with Hull City from the players and staff to the owner and especially the fans.
“I am very proud to have been through this experience, it was challenging but a very exciting time for me.
“Hull City will always be a part of my heart and I wish the team all the very best for the future.”
“Leonid has worked tirelessly in his role and has acted with complete honour and been a pleasure to work with,” said Hull vice-chairman Ehab Allam.
"Unfortunately results have not improved as both parties would have hoped and therefore it was agreed for the relationship to come to an end. I would like to thank Leonid and Oleg for their efforts here and sincerely wish them well for the future.”
Slutsky won three Russian Premier League titles as CSKA Moscow manager, resigning from that role in 2016. He took charge of the Russian national team for just under a year, after Fabio Capello left in 2015, overseeing their qualification for Euro 2016, where they were knocked out at the group stage.
Slutsky’s playing career was cut short aged just 19 because of a knee injury, suffered when he fell out of a tree while trying to rescue a neighbour’s cat.


There are few sports so compelling when played like this. Quins waited to the last‑but‑one minute to overturn the deficit they had wrestled with practically all match – Tim Visser’s try denying Saracens, their most bitter rivals, at the death. Already staggering under a terrible injury list, Quins lost further key players in a match of relentless intensity, but managed to pull themselves out of a familiar rut of possession without points to score two tries in the final 10 minutes.
For Saracens the match was costly, too. Maro Itoje was taken to hospital with a facial injury that his club and country will hope does not prove structural. He collided with his international colleague Mike Brown early in the second half and left the field with blood pouring from his mouth.
This, though, was a triumph for Harlequins’ resilience, in particular for their half-backs, at either end of the experience spectrum. All three of their tries were set up by the offensive kicks that Danny Care has made his trademark, while the young man outside him, James Lang – called up at short notice – survived a torrid opening 10 minutes, including a shoulder injury, to grow into the game impressively.
“I thought he might be off,” said John Kingston, Quins’ director of rugby, of Lang’s early knock. “But for him to come through and do what he did so well was wonderful to see. It was a grandstand finish, but the team had earned the right to stay in the game.”
It looked as if this match – however brutal, however enthralling – was running down to the most predictable of outcomes. If ever there were a team for squandering oodles of possession, it’s Quins; if ever one for making the most of very little, Saracens.
And so it seemed to have played out. The visitors’ defensive system, so ferocious that they have given it a name – the wolf pack – had stood firm in the face of wave after wave of Quins attacks. Saracens, with most of their big guns in place, had sent on a further phalanx of players huge of body and experience, and they led by more than a score as the game entered the final 10 minutes. It may feel as if Saracens never lose from such a position, but the Stoop is the ground they like least, and a mischievous sort might wonder whether they have lost something of their edge. This is their third consecutive Premiership defeat, and every one has been lost from a winning position.
No less glory, though, to a ravaged Quins squad for finding the way to victory. Lang, whistled up when Marcus Smith failed to recover from a knock to the head the week before, was thrown in among those wolves, who quickly showed him they knew a thing or two about attack as well as defence. Owen Farrell sent Vincent Koch on the rampage through Lang’s inside shoulder, which took quite a blow. Thence Koch and Jamie George handled like centres to send Brad Barritt over in only the second minute. Lang was rattled. Not only did he require treatment to that shoulder, he had a drop-goal attempt charged down and sent a punt straight to touch within the next five minutes, at the end of which Farrell landed a penalty to stretch the visitors’ lead to 10 points.
Harlequins took over the ball then, their efforts building to a relentless siege around the 20-minute mark. Lang, his composure recovering, sparked it with a wicked penalty to the corner. Quins tried every which way to breach Saracens’ line – lineouts, scrums, darts, hit-ups – until Care deployed the latest of his deadly chip kicks, this one to send Charlie Walker over in the corner. But for all the possession and pressure of Quins, a half-time scoreline of 10-5 to Sarries felt ominously familiar.
Lang landed a penalty early in the second half, but two more from Farrell gave Saracens, who were starting to find a bit more possession at last, an eight-point lead, as the game entered its denouement.
Up stepped Care. A tapped penalty is one long-established trademark of his, and when he followed up the latest with another, the chip ahead, Walker won the race for Quins’ second try.
Farrell’s fourth penalty forced Quins into the hunt for another, and to the delirium of a full house it followed on cue. Lang’s penalty to the corner set up an attacking lineout, from which Care sent over another cross-kick. Alex Goode, another player of untold experience in the Saracens ranks, could not gather and Visser had a clear run all the way to the line.
“We chucked it away,” Mark McCall said. “We put a huge amount of energy and effort into the game, got ourselves into a winning position, but it was wasted effort.” Saracens, in third, now face a rut of their own, rather less familiar. Nine teams are separated by 10 points. It makes for compelling drama, indeed.

Relief was quickly followed by reality for Wales. Victory against a side that could only be identified as South Africa by the colour of the jerseys completed a mediocre year on a high and their first match in 2018 here against Scotland promises to be a lot more taxing.
It took Wales 93 years to work out a way of beating the Springboks and in that long barren run, together with the 15 years that followed, it would only have been rarely said that Scotland posed more of a threat. South Africa were so shambolic in defence that the hosts were able to park the running rugby they have been attempting to refine this year and give their kicking game a service.
Wales were 14 points up in seven minutes and 21-3 ahead just before the interval but they ended up hanging on to record their third victory against South Africa in Cardiff in as many years. Their three tries came from kicks, two from Dan Biggar and one by his chargedown of Andries Coetzee’s laboured clearance, although they made little impression with ball in hand.
They were without 10 first-team regulars and lost Biggar early in the second half with concussion, but while they look to broaden their outlook they are having to run from behind the gainline in phase play, lacking ball-carriers with impact at forward as well as inside-centre. They are a threat from set-pieces but, with their scrum in disarray against South Africa and attacking lineouts rare because they were awarded only three penalties, they lacked the means to build on their lead.
They have players to return for the Six Nations such as Liam Williams, George North and Justin Tipuric, yet it is the lack of carrying options that will tax the head coach, Warren Gatland. He used 38 players in the four autumn Tests, needing to build depth with a number of players who have served him manfully this decade showing signs of wear and tear.
It was only a few autumns ago that Gatland talked about Wales becoming a fixture in the top four of the world rankings. They started the weekend in eighth, some way behind New Zealand, England and Ireland, and they will go into the Six Nations unburdened by expectation.
Gatland said that he was happy other teams were being talked up, but so did Rob Howley in his capacity as interim head coach at the start of the year and the team finished one off the bottom. Wales may have opted for a playmaker at 12, but the combination of Biggar and Owen Williams is not as complementary as that of George Ford and Owen Farrell for England or Johnny Sexton and Farrell for the British & Irish Lions in the summer.
The lack of carriers means the speed of delivery at the breakdown is an issue, an area the South Africa hooker Malcolm Marx sabotaged on Saturday. If the question was ‘why Wales did not build on their healthy lead?’, the answer lay in how their three tries were scored: they came from a cross-kick, a grubber and a chargedown and even Italy in the Six Nations should be more defensively aware than South Africa were in the opening 30 minutes.
Wales certainly have spirit and, in the forwards Alun Wyn Jones and Taulupe Faletau, possess two players who have not been worn down by the physical demands imposed on them over the years. They were the difference between winning and losing, driving the team in the crucial final 10 minutes, but at full-back Leigh Halfpenny is struggling to find the thrust his side need in the position.
Gatland talked later about the need to mix and match and not rely on one style of play, but Wales remain most comfortable when reading from a script. They need a few ad‑libbers in an international game that is becoming increasingly hectic and the coach, in his final two years in charge, now faces his most challenging period.
South Africa’s next match is against England in the summer by which time they could be under new management. A meeting of SA Rugby on 13 December will consider Allister Coetzee’s future as head coach after a difficult two years at the helm. He has conducted himself with dignity and put a plan in place where there was chaos, but he has had to contend with problems that are the province of others.
Wales and South Africa are two powers of the game with proud histories who are down the rankings largely because of domestic problems induced by professionalism. Wales have punched above their weight under Gatland, but a top-down approach will not do for either nation, as the weekend showed.


The Crimson Tide got the nod over Ohio State and will play Clemson in the College Football Playoff on 1 January in the Sugar Bowl. Oklahoma and Georgia will meet in the Rose Bowl semi-final a few hours earlier.
Tide or Buckeyes was the question facing the selection committee, the toughest call in the four-year history of the playoff. The Tide had been more consistent and lost just once. The Buckeyes lost twice, including an embarrassing 31-point beating at unranked Iowa, but have the more impressive set of victories. Ohio State won the Big Ten while Alabama did not even win their Southeastern Conference division.
The committee rolled with the Tide, and for the first time the playoff will include two teams from the same conference. Alabama join SEC champion Georgia and an all-SEC title game is possible.
Committee chairman Kirby Hocutt said the Iowa loss weighed Ohio State down and the Buckeyes were not close enough to the Tide for the Big Ten championship result a 27-21 win over previously unbeaten Wisconsin to matter.
“As we saw Alabama play week in and week in out, the selection committee believed Alabama was the better football team,” Hocutt told ESPN. “When we looked at Ohio State, when you looked at their resume it was impressive but it wasn’t enough for the selection committee to place them in above Alabama.”
Alabama (11-1) made it 4-for-4 in the playoff, the only team that has made them all. And for the third straight season, college football gets an Alabama-Clemson matchup in the playoff, though this time in the semi-finals. The Tide beat the Tigers in a classic national championship game in Glendale, Arizona, two seasons ago. The teams played another thriller last season and Clemson took the title in Tampa, Florida.
Clemson (12-1) are making their third straight playoff appearance, but first without star quarterback Deshaun Watson. The Tigers won another Atlantic Coast Conference championship with Kelly Bryant as the quarterback.
Georgia (12-1) and Oklahoma (12-1) have never played. The Bulldogs have surged in their second season under coach Kirby Smart. After winning eight games last season, Georgia won the SEC for the first time since 2005. Oklahoma are in the playoff for the second time and will likely bring the Heisman Trophy winner.
Quarterback Baker Mayfield is the favorite to win the award next weekend. If so, Mayfield will be the third player to go from winning the Heisman on to the playoff, joining Oregon’s Marcus Mariota in 2014 and Alabama’s Derrick Henry in 2015.
The Alabama-or-Ohio State debate was the trickiest of the playoff era. Most talented or most accomplished? Neither team neatly matched precedent. Ohio State made it to the playoff without even playing in their conference title game last season, but those Buckeyes had a more convincing resume, with three victories against top-10 teams. Alabama could not match that.
Not only had no team ever made the playoff with two losses, but none had as ugly a stain on their resume as Ohio State’s 31-point loss at Iowa. Tide coach Nick Saban mentioned it Saturday night on ESPN as the selection committee went to work for the last time this season.
That the most controversial playoff pick yet came down to these two teams made it an even juicer plotline. Alabama has dominated college football for a decade since Saban took over. Ohio State is one of the few teams to interrupt the Tide’s championship machine during the Saban era, beating the Tide in the semi-finals in 2014 on the way to a national title.
They are two of college football’s flagship programs, rich in both tradition. Also, they are the teams the rest of college football loves to hate, the teams that always seem to get the benefit of the doubt in the rankings. Neither had a slam dunk case. In the Top 25 released earlier Sunday, Alabama was fourth by a mere seven points over No5 Ohio State. Not that that matters. The committee’s process is not the same of the traditional polls.
The panel of 13 includes former and current athletic administrators, including the athletic director from Ohio State, and former coaches. They break teams into tiers, rank them, debate them and often rank them again and again until a consensus is formed.
In 2014, fans of TCU and Baylor were upset when Ohio State jumped the Texas schools on championship weekend. Last year, Ohio State was involved in a bit of a controversy again when it didn’t win its conference but got in. The final spot came down to Penn State and Washington and the Huskies won out.


Gordon Elliott was refusing to get carried away by talk of a first trainers’ title despite making history after claiming all three Grade One winners at Fairyhouse yesterday. Elliott led this year’s Irish championship by almost €300,000 (£265,000) heading into day two of the track’s winter festival and stretched further clear by becoming the first man to land Royal Bond novice hurdle, the Hatton’s Grace and the Drinmore novice chase on the same day.
“To train three Grade One winners in one day is unbelievable, it’s something you dream about,” Elliott said.
Despite the achievement, Elliott had memories still fresh in his mind of last year’s title race – when he looked home and dry heading into the Punchestown festival only to be denied by a late charge by Willie Mullins. “Last year was heartbreaking. I was gutted to get beat, but just to get that close was something special and just to be in the same sentence as Willie Mullins, I’m happy with that.”
Mengli Khan, an evens favourite, scored an impressive victory in the Royal Bond under Jack Kennedy and is the general 7-1 favourite for the Supreme novice hurdle at Cheltenham in March.
Elliott said: “He could be a better horse on better ground and is a two-miler which we don’t have too many of. Gigginstown buy big three-mile chasers, but it’s nice to have a few of them as well. We will probably have a look at something over Christmas, but we’ll get him home after today and make sure he’s in one piece.”
Kennedy swiftly doubled up as Apple’s Jade produced a brilliant front-running display to defend her crown in the Hatton’s Grace. Also even-money, she was nine lengths too good for the eight-times Grade One winner Nichols Canyon and is the 7-4 favourite to win the mares’ hurdle at Cheltenham for the second time.
Elliott said: “She’s only five years of age and she’s six Grade Ones won. She’s a different mare at home now than she was last year. “We will give her a bit of a break now and she might go back to Punchestown for the race she got beaten in last year [in February]. The mares’ hurdle at Cheltenham is the plan and then the Punchestown festival. If we mind her we might get a few years out of her.”
Death Duty, an 8-11 favourite, completed the Elliott and Gigginstown Stud hat-trick, extending his unbeaten record over fences to three with an all-the-way success under Davy Russell.
“He’s a horse I’ve always liked, but maybe I was getting it wrong last year saying he wanted three miles. He could be more a JLT [novice chase] horse,” Elliott said.
Michael O’Leary urged punters to beware the hype over his unbeaten novice hurdler Samcro. The Gigginstown owner is less impressed than others of the achievements so far of the Elliott-trained gelding – who is as short as 15-8 favourite for the Ballymore novice hurdle in March.
“The hype with Samcro is rubbish,” O’Leary told At The Races. “He’s won his maiden hurdle, he won a graded hurdle reasonably well – Death Duty did the same last year, went to Cheltenham and blew up.
“He’d have to go to Cheltenham and actually win a race there. The rest of it is just to delude ante-post punters betting at this time of the year. He’s not as good as the hype would make out, he will never be as good as the hype will make out. If he turns out to be a reasonably good chaser in time, great, but he’s not the next coming of Jesus Christ.”

Manchester City again frustrated Manchester United by grabbing a late victory and all three points. The score showed 1-1 and the clock 83 minutes when Pep Guardiola’s men produced yet another dramatic winner.
Kevin De Bruyne nonchalantly flicked over a ball from the right and there was an acrobatic David Silva to hit home. This sent the Etihad Stadium into raptures, made it nine points claimed in the closing eight minutes of matches this season, and ensured City remain eight points ahead of United. The 175th Manchester derby is up next, at Old Trafford on Sunday, and José Mourinho’s men must surely win that to keep their title hopes realistic.
As Vincent Kompany and Fernandinho are a booking away from a ban, Guardiola rested them with an eye on the derby. Leroy Sané was included, despite also being one yellow card from a suspension, as Eliaquim Mangala, Silva and Danilo also came in and Ilkay Gündogan and Gabriel Jesus also started on the bench.
For West Ham David Moyes was forced to leave out Joe Hart, who is a City loanee, and the injured Winston Reid. Dropped were André Ayew and Marko Arnautovic, with Adrián, Declan Rice, Edimilson Fernandes and Michail Antonio all named.
Moyes fielded a five-man defence and the early sense was that attacks would consist of a lump-it approach that hoped to capitalise on Antonio’s directness. It was via this route that West Ham claimed their first corner, along the right, after Antonio drove forward into the channel. Aaron Cresswell took it, found Cheikhou Kouyaté’s head, and City panicked for a moment as Antonio was free to connect but could not direct the finish.
Fabian Delph said of West Ham’s approach: “Our intensity was there but when there were 11 men behind the ball who aren’t interested in attacking and just parking the bus – it was difficult.”
Yet when West Ham played the quick stuff City love, they, too, posed a problem. Manuel Lanzini and Arthur Masuaku combined down the left, the latter sent over a low cross, and a brief mix-up between Ederson and Mangala almost allowed Antonio to capitalise before the goalkeeper grabbed possession.
Moyes’s hopes of trying to stymie City worked as the first half progressed and the home side struggled for tempo and rhythm. Having decided to surrender the initiative, both territorially and via the manager’s selection, West Ham gradually edged into the contest. Lanzini warmed Ederson’s fingers and won a corner. While nothing came of this, any fear the strugglers might concede early were unfounded, the match remaining at deadlock as the 40-minute mark came and went.
Sixty seconds before the break, proceedings became far better for West Ham as they took the lead. When Cresswell took a short corner from the right City slumbered and Lanzini had an age to return the ball. The left-back’s delivery found the head of Angelo Ogbonna and though Nicolás Otamendi might have got closer, the finish allowed Ederson no chance as the Italian claimed a first Premier League goal.
West Ham’s lead was deserved but to turn things around Guardiola brought on Jesus for Danilo and now Sergio Agüero had a central attacking partner.
Yet the Argentinian, who has 11 goals in 15 appearances but has been less prolific since being in a taxi crash in the Netherlands in late September, would prove muted throughout. Guardiola said: “It is not easy for him with 10 players there, almost no space. Sooner or later, he is going to come back. His part in the season was top before the accident in Amsterdam.”
While the aim of introducing Jesus was to pin the visitors back, instead City were forced to defend an early second-half corner. They did so and now the home crowd found their voice and the sky-blue shirts came close to an equaliser. Delph, Sané, Jesus and Silva swapped passes along the left before Raheem Sterling’s shot was repelled.
Now, though, City made the breakthrough, created by the effervescent Jesus. The Brazilian did admirably to squeeze in a low pass from the right and Otamendi, positioned where you would expect to find a centre-forward, beat Adrián with a poacher’s finish. This was the Argentinian’s fourth goal in his last 14 games, a fine return for a centre-back.
Adrián was performing impressively in Hart’s absence. Next, he ensured his team stayed level by flinging himself to the left to keep out a Sané rocket. West Ham’s previous solidity had evaporated and they were engaged in an increasingly desperate rearguard action.
The contest had quickened, to City’s benefit only, but just as David de Gea sparkled in United’s win at Arsenal on Saturday, so too did Adrián. After stopping a De Bruyne effort he then denied Jesus, as West Ham continued to cling on.
Ultimately, though, they failed to do so courtesy of the Silva finish, though Diafro Sakho missed a golden chance right at the end to snatch a draw, Antonio had also missed one moments before the Spaniard’s game-winning intervention.
Guardiola can now prepare for the trip to Kharkiv for Wednesday night’s final Champions League group game against Shakhtar Donetsk. “After the international break, we had four games and we were able to win all four games against physical teams,” he said. “Tomorrow is recovery and regeneration and then we go to Ukraine.”


The best of Sunday’s FA Cup ties came at Ewood Park, where League One’s Blackburn Rovers made a storming start and were three goals up on League Two’s Crewe Alexandra inside 20 minutes. But then Rekeem Harper, the Blackburn midfielder, was sent off at the same time as conceding a penalty – Chris Porter converted – and then, just before the hour, Elliott Bennett was also dismissed. Eddie Nolan soon cut the deficit to one before Porter drew Crewe level, but despite a two-man advantage, they could not force a win; the sides will contest a replay on 12 December.
There remains the possibility of a shock following events at the Laithwaite Community Stadium, home to Woking, who fell behind to League One Peterborough and then saw Jonathan Bond save Chez Isaac’s penalty. But with just six minutes remaining Joe Ward earned them a replay at London Road.
At Adams Park, Wycombe Wanderers needed late goals from Craig Mackail-Smith and Adebayo Akinfenwa to dispose of the Isthmian League’s Leatherhead, whose run in 1974-75 is also enshrined in FA Cup folklore. Leatherhead had taken the lead after eight minutes, Jack Midson dispatching a penalty, but Sam Saunders equalised with a fine free-kick. In between the two clinching goals, Sammy Moore, Leatherhead’s player-manager, inspired his players by getting himself dismissed.
Coventry City, FA Cup winners in 1987, moved serenely into the next round, three goals between the 27th and 48th minutes proving more than enough to account for Boreham Wood. The blow of defeat had, though, already been softened for the visiting supporters by the chairman’s provision of a free continental breakfast for them all.
Another former finalist, Luton Town, also enjoyed a relatively stress-free afternoon. Though it took them 40 minutes to breach Gateshead’s defence, they did so twice more inside the 90 minutes and then twice again in stoppage-time to complete a 5-0 thrashing; the goals came from Olly Lee, his brother Elliot Lee, Luke Berry, Daniel Potts and Danny Hylton. But the scoreline was overshadowed by a serious injury to the hosts’ Scott Barrow, who lost consciousness after colliding with his own goalkeeper in the buildup to the first goal – play was delayed for 15 minutes while he was treated. “He is up and talking in hospital awaiting scan results,” confirmed the club later.
Elsewhere, Lyle Taylor scored in the 70th and 81st minutes to give AFC Wimbledon a 3-1 win at home to Charlton Athletic, while at the Keepmoat Stadium, Darren Ferguson’s Doncaster Rovers saw off their fellow League One team Scunthorpe; also through are Mansfield Town – for whom Jimmy Spencer scored a hat-trick – and Newport County, who beat Guiseley and Cambridge United respectively. The draw for the third round is on Monday at 7pm.
In the second round of the women’s FA Cup, Middlesbrough were only 1-0 up at half-time against Farsley Celtic at Teesdale Park thanks to a goal from Millie Bell but ran riot in the second half, scoring seven more goals, to finish 8-1 winners. Emily Scarr recorded a 15-minute hat-trick while Holly Manders and Bianca Owens both scored twice.
Sarah Danby also registered a hat-trick for Huddersfield Town in their 7-0 home thrashing of West Bromwich Albion and Lewes beat Enfield Town by the same scoreline.
Coventry United secured their place in the third round by beating West Ham 6-1, with all the goals coming from different players. Coventry were 1-0 up at half-time but the visitors equalised from the penalty spot early in the second half only to see their opponents score five times without reply.
Bradford City and Charlton Athletic both enjoyed 5-0 wins against Long Eaton United and Queens Park Rangers respectively while Crystal Palace won 3-0 at New London Lionesses thanks to goals from Megan Chandler, Stafanie Simmons and Gemma Bryan.
Lauren Bracewell was the star for Burnley, keeping Stoke City at bay for 120 minutes in a match that was goalless after extra time, and then saving two penalties in the subsequent shootout which her side won 4-1.
Derby County needed penalties to see off Hull City after the match finished 1-1 after 120 minutes, as did Stevenage in their win against Ipswich Town.
The match between Brighouse Town and Wolverhampton Wanderers was postponed because of a waterlogged pitch.


And then there were two. Perhaps the biggest news coming out of the epic 2017 tournament – which saw Australia edge out an incredibly committed and brave England by a mere six points – was not only the revival of international rugby league as a viable concept, but the representative retirement of Cooper Cronk. It was not entirely unexpected, but still the end of something special. With full-time sounding at Suncorp Stadium on Saturday, the ‘big three’ are no more.
Since they were spotty teenagers coming through the ranks at the Norths Devils in the Queensland Cup competition at the turn of the century, Cameron Smith, Billy Slater and Cronk have been joined at the hip. This much-vaunted troika have played close to 400 NRL, Origin and Test games together as perhaps the most valuable one-to-three-punch in rugby league history. Spines have never been as slick or successful as this. Glory for the Melbourne Storm, Queensland and Australia has consistently followed the trio around.
But finally it is has come to a close. After the Kangaroos pipped the Poms in the final, Cronk announced that his days in the green and gold, as well as the maroon, are no more. “There’s probably two reasons for it, the playmaker said. “One, I’ve had one hell of a run. I never thought any of this was even possible in my wildest dreams.
“A kid growing up 20 minutes from here on south side of Brisbane. I never knew, thought or hoped that I’d play this amount of rep football. I think it’s time for someone else to grab a couple of those memories and those moments because I’ve had my fair share.
“That game tonight was Test match football at its best. It’s fitting to finish the 2017 World Cup here at Suncorp with that game as my last.”
Successfully defending the World Cup they won in the UK in 2013 – and becoming the first Australian side to win the Paul Barriere trophy on home soil in nearly four decades – was certainly some way to go out. While Smith and Slater are expected to go on next year and play representative football (though Slater has hinted at possibly hanging up his boots) it won’t be the same; not without the diminutive third wheel who had to wait longer for his chance at the top.
Kangaroo skipper Cameron Smith didn’t need to be reminded of the special bond he holds with Cronk and Slater. “I’ve been playing with those guys since 2001 when we were kids,” he said after the final. “It’s always special to be able to run out with those two guys, we’ve been together since we were 17. It’s been a very long, very enjoyable and successful career that we’ve shared together.
“There’s been some lows in the careers of ours, but very much outweighed by the highs and this is most definitely one of them. To be able to wear our country’s colours on home soil and lift up the World Cup trophy – it doesn’t get much better than that.”
With the mercurial Jonathan Thurston also calling time on his representative career earlier this year, these are interesting times for both Australia and Queensland. Considering both Smith and Slater turn 35 in 2018, the clock is ticking. At most, the pair have two seasons left in them.
The rest of the world, and indeed NSW, has been waiting for more than a decade for the ‘big three’ to retire. The hope is that without that influential threesome, the playing field will be much more level. But that is an incredibly simplistic view.
England has been praying that Australia’s next generation of talent will be worse than the current one since the ‘invincibles’ toured the UK and France in 1982. On that tour, led by Wally Lewis, Mal Meninga, Peter Sterling and Brett Kenny, the Kangaroos were undefeated in 22 matches on the trot. Records fell game after game. The belief was that when Lewis, Meninga, Sterling and Kenny retired, Australia would finally be beatable.
It didn’t happen. After them came Brad Fittler, Allan Langer and Laurie Daley. Andrew Johns, Darren Lockyer and Wendell Sailor were next in the production line, soon to be followed by Smith, Slater, Thurston, Cronk, Greg Inglis and the rest. The list goes on.
Already in this tournament we have seen the likes of Valentine Holmes and Michael Morgan stand up. Holmes has scored a staggering 12 tries and Morgan has seamlessly fitted into Thurston’s number six jumper, after leading North Queensland to an NRL grand final. Even without the injured Inglis, Darius Boyd and Matt Scott, not to mention defectors Jarryd Hayne and Andrew Fifita, the Kangaroos were undefeated and hardly troubled.
For the 2017 World Cup brothers Tom and Jake Trbojevic, Cameron Munster, David Klemmer, Reagan Campbell-Gillard and Holmes will be in their prime. Behind them is the emerging talent of Jack Bird, Ash Taylor, Nathan Cleary and Latrell Mitchell, among others. The talent pipeline is fully functional.
The ‘big three’ may be finished as a three-man band, but an end to Australia’s rugby league dominance may have to wait a little longer.


Later on Monday, in a conference room in Zurich, the 19 representatives of Fifa’s Member Associations Committee will gather to sift through the wreckage of Australian football’s governance crisis. It seems impossible this body could do anything other than recommend Fifa intervenes decisively to resolve an increasingly bitter dispute, one that plumbed new depths either side of last week’s AGM.
Fifa instructed FFA to comply with statute 15 (j) and democratise its governing congress by 30 November. That deadline was itself an extension from 30 March, a date in turn six months after a Fifa delegation visited Australia to spell out their concerns.
We’re into injury time at the end of extra-time, and the referee needs to call a halt to the futility. An in-house resolution is surely now a pipe dream and the longer this situation is allowed to drag on, the more damage it will cause.
The Member Associations Committee will be presented with a catalogue of dysfunction. They will have to acknowledge that Australia has the smallest governing congress in Fifa and that chairmanship of FFA’s board passed unopposed from father to son. They will be pressed to consider why FFA has been unable to reach consensus among stakeholders in an imbroglio that has dragged on nearly two years. 
The embarrassing Fifa/AFC delegation visit in August cannot be ignored, nor can the reams of acrimonious correspondence, topped off by the ill will that bookended the AGM. That last point in particular has to resonate strongly in today’s deliberations.
Last Thursday, A-League clubs questioned one of the cornerstones of the current leadership – its independence, and they did so in a devastatingly pointed and calculated manoeuvre. This follows earlier allegations FFA gerrymandered congress to guarantee board appointments.
Later that day FFA chairman Steven Lowy described anybody who voted against his agenda as heralding a return to “the bad old days”, taking specific aim at clubs for grasping for power and money.
Faced with a total breakdown in working relationship at the apex of Australian football, it is incomprehensible a circuit breaker would not be recommended. Irrespective of blame, something has to give. Yet the fight continues.
In an FFA media release in advance of the AGM, Lowy outlined the possibility for a negotiated outcome as opposed to the imposition of a normalisation committee. “FIFA has advised throughout the process that there is a range of possible actions and we would discuss what suits the circumstances in Australia,” he said. By Thursday evening this had become: “We believe we will be able to work with Fifa on sorting this out going forward.” 
Under the circumstances this seems fanciful. FFA’s leaders have had two years to resolve this issue and the longer they’ve failed to do so, the more rancorous the atmosphere has become. How can further mediation be expected to change anything?
Lowy’s defence – that he is looking out for the best interests of the game as a whole – may be just, and it would be naive not to believe that A-League clubs are operating to advance their own causes. But this situation is broken, the enmity between warring parties too acute, and the game needs to move on.
The Member Associations Committee communicates its advice to the decision-making Bureau of the Council. This seven-person panel handles Fifa’s urgent business when it is imprudent to wait for the next full Council meeting. If called upon, this group will likely convene later this week, or early next week, probably in the UAE where key representatives will be attending the start of the Club World Cup.
The Bureau of the Council is chaired by Fifa’s president Gianni Infantino, a man who has crossed paths often with Lowy. As recently as last week the pair were in each other’s company at the AFC annual awards ceremony in Bangkok.
This may be an incidental skerrick of information but it’s about as convincing a reason as any available to explain Lowy’s bullish demeanour in the aftermath of a humiliating AGM. Not only did the chairman not relinquish his post or indicate the slightest contrition as might have been expected, he doubled down, burning bridges with the largest revenue generators in the game and the member federations representing the two biggest grassroots communities. 
“If anything, we’ll fight for it stronger than we did before,” he said. “We don’t feel weaker because of it, we actually feel emboldened in our passion to maintain an independent game.”
Australian football is in limbo. There are big ticket items that require urgent attention that cannot be addressed until all stakeholders are working with a unity of purpose. There is no evidence to suggest prolonging this standoff in the hope of a breakthrough is realistic.
It may be embarrassing, it may be unsettling, but it may now be in the game’s best interests to end the week under the control of a Fifa normalisation committee.


Rangers clung on for a 2-1 victory over Aberdeen with 10 men after Ryan Jack’s Pittodrie return ended in a red card controversy.
Graeme Murty, the Rangers caretaker manager, had backed the former Dons captain to keep his cool as he ran out at his old stomping ground for the first time with his new club. But Jack lasted just 56 minutes before collecting his fourth red card in 19 appearances since his Ibrox switch – although two were later rescinded – after crunching into Stevie May.
Goals from Danny Wilson and Josh Windass were enough to seal Gers’ second win over Derek McInnes’s team in five days as they overtook the Dons to move into second spot, despite a stunning free-kick scored by the 19-year-old Frank Ross.
Rangers drew first blood with Wilson’s opener 14 minutes in. Graeme Shinnie’s barge on Jason Holt gave Declan John the chance to swing in free-kick from wide. The Welshman’s delivery was packed with menace but the Dons were culpable as they allowed Wilson to wander free before looping a fantastic header into the top corner.
The big talking point came after 56 minutes as Jack’s follow-through after playing a pass saw him plant his studs into May’s ankle. A look of disbelief quickly spread across the midfielder’s face as the referee Willie Collum immediately reached for his red. But the dismissal did not hold the visitors back and they doubled their lead after 63 minutes. James Tavernier’s burst forward left Aberdeen scrambling but there was no stopping Daniel Candeias as he slotted a perfect ball across for Windass to finish from close range.
The deficit was trimmed back two minutes later as the substitute Ross whipped a perfect free-kick past Wes Foderingham. Aberdeen threw everything at their opponents in the closing stages but Fabio Cardoso again came to Rangers’ rescue in stoppage time as he headed Greg Stewart’s shot off the line.
The defeat could yet end up being a sorry swansong for McInnes, with the Rangers chairman, Dave King, understood to be readying himself to offer the current Ibrox vacancy to the former Light Blues midfielder. It is now approaching six weeks since Pedro Caixinha was axed and the protracted recruitment process and subsequent rumours have frustrated McInnes.
“I made my position clear a few weeks ago and this has been ongoing,” said the 46-year-old. “It just feels as if it has dragged on and on. I’m not happy with how things have played out. I know [the press] have a job to do and must be getting fed some sort of stuff, so there has been plenty of encouragement to run stories. Everybody seems to be in the know and every other day there is someone giving an opinion on my future and what Rangers are doing. It’s not been as straightforward as it should have been.”
Murty, who is expected to revert to his under-20s duties this week, hailed his players for responding to Jack’s dismissal. “I’m not going to shout about the referee,” he said. “He made a decision, we had to deal with the consequences. I feel for Ryan. I know he’s gutted. We’ll have a look at it again and we’ll decide what to do as a club but I thought he handled the occasion up to that point remarkably well. He showed a degree of composure I’m not sure I’d have been capable of in his shoes.”


Historically in English rugby league there are no shortage of instances of chest‑beating and confidence that brighter times lie ahead following defeat by Australia – but this time, despite losing a World Cup final, it was hard not to feel genuinely encouraged.
There is nothing too satisfying in being plucky losers again. But as the players head home from a gruelling six weeks and the end of a season which, for some, began last December, there is a golden opportunity for the game in England to build on a performance which shows the gap behind the Kangaroos has been bridged somewhat.
Perhaps the biggest positive from this tournament is that, for once, England appear to have piqued the wider public’s interest. Playing the final at a civilised hour – their quarter-final and semi-final kicked off at 5am UK time – on BBC One will have inevitably lured some floating viewers on Saturday morning.
Growth is not just about a strong international squad; for rugby league, genuine progress is investment in the game’s grassroots, increasing the talent pool at all levels and pushing more people – and money – into the sport.
The Rugby Football League will, therefore, have taken a keen interest in the viewing figures for the final which peaked at two million. There has been much discussion of missed opportunities following England’s defeat on Saturday but this, realistically, is the one which matters.
It is of paramount importance for the sport’s development in England that there is a clear international plan for the four years leading up to the next World Cup, which will be held in this country in 2021. For that the Rugby League International Federation, which lays the framework for international scheduling, must take some responsibility, but the RFL is at least tasked with making sure there are as many opportunities for England to play as possible.
As good as Super League is, if these past six weeks have taught the powers that be anything, it is that international rugby league is where the sport can truly force its way into the mainstream. In the past, rugby league has been guilty of making fans wait a full year for the next England game – that will not be the case in 2018, with discussions already under way about a mid-season Test.
This would not be rugby league without some left-field thinking, however. There have been discussions about taking the game on the road, with Denver mooted as a potential location. The Guardian understands those talks have stalled, however, with logistics and the potential opposition stumbling blocks for any game to be taken across the Atlantic in 2018.
However, the more England play – the England Knights concept will be revived to play in a new Six Nations tournament next autumn, alongside the Test series with New Zealand – the better. For that to improve, the clubs also need to be on the same page. Super League’s schedule is top-heavy, with an overriding feeling in some quarters that the season is too congested.
More international breaks, and more chances to play together, will unlock England’s undoubted potential for whomever is the next coach. And on that point there is also the question of who will be in charge for the mid-season Test next year.
Wayne Bennett, whose appointment two years ago was met with some disdain, has unquestionably improved the national side during his time in charge. But he is now out of contract, and at the age of 67 may feel like his time belongs solely in Australia with his club commitments at Brisbane. The RFL, though, would be wise to persuade him this project is worth continuing, because, whether it is Bennett or someone else, the coach inherits not only a talented squad but one which has plenty of years left in it.
Of this year’s World Cup squad, only Sean O’Loughlin and Chris Heighington will definitely not be around for the next tournament in 2021. As Cameron Smith, Billy Slater and Cooper Cronk lifted the World Cup for Australia yet again on Saturday, it is perhaps important to remember that they have spent the best part of a decade playing together for both state and country.
This group, by comparison, are much earlier on in their international careers – and the fact that Smith, Slater and Cronk will have all retired by 2021 also offers a crumb of comfort. The sport, though, has to seize the initiative and ensure this chance is not wasted, for the good of rugby league.


A cricket Test match between India and Sri Lanka was repeatedly interrupted on Sunday with claims players were “continuously vomiting” due to hazardous pollution levels in the Indian capital.
Commentators said it was the first recorded instance of an international match being halted due to the toxic smog that afflicts much of north India year-round but worsens to hazardous levels during winter months.
Airborne pollution levels 15 times the World Health Organisation limits confronted players on the second day of the third Test at the Feroz Shah Kotla stadium in Delhi on Sunday.
As the haze worsened, many Sri Lankan players returned from lunch wearing face masks before complaining to umpires, who halted play for 20 minutes to consult with team doctors and match officials.
The match resumed but was interrupted twice more as bowlers Lahiru Gamage and Suranga Lakmal left the field mid-over with breathing difficulties.
“We had players coming off the field and vomiting,” the Sri Lanka coach Nic Pothas told reporters after the match.
“There were oxygen cylinders in the change room. It’s not normal for players to suffer in that way while playing the game.”
Pothas said Lakmal was “continuously vomiting” in the changing room. “I think it’s the first time that everybody has come across that situation,” he said.
“There aren’t too many rules regarding pollution. What we are going to do tomorrow is in the hands of the match referee. They will have meetings tonight to put in some sort of a precedent if it happens like this tomorrow.”
The Indian bowler Kuldeep Yadav was also seen sporting a face mask as he brought drinks to teammates on the field.
Umpires were awaiting Lakmal’s return to the field when the Indian skipper, Virat Kohli, elected to declare with his side cruising on 536 runs with three wickets in hand.
The interruptions drew boos from the crowd for Sri Lanka’s opening batsmen as they made their way to the crease, where they played without masks.
The acting president of India’s cricket board was also unimpressed and said he would write to his Sri Lankan counterpart about the incident.
“If 20,000 people in the stands did not have problems and the Indian team did not face any issue, I wonder why the Sri Lankan team made a big fuss?” CK Khanna said.
It is the latest professional-grade match in Delhi to be affected by air pollution after two matches in the domestic Ranji Trophy tournament were abandoned in the city when it was engulfed in smog in November 2016.
Some Indian fans accused the Sri Lankan side of being melodramatic but the cricket writer Ayaz Memon said the episode sent an “unedifying message” about pollution in the city.
Schools were shut and doctors declared a public health emergency in Delhi last month as pollution levels spiked to levels 40 times the WHO safe limits, likened to smoking at least 50 cigarettes in a day.
United Airlines briefly halted flights into the capital and foreign diplomats voiced fears the city could become a “non-family” posting due to the polluted environment.
Doctors warn against physical activity in the smog but around 30,000 runners still participated in an annual half-marathon in the city in November.
Delhi officials have been accused of not preparing for what has become an annual crisis each winter, while the Indian government has played down the urgency and health risks associated with the problem.
The extremely poor air in the city is the result of a combination of road dust, open fires, vehicle exhaust fumes, industrial emissions and the burning of crop residues in neighbouring states. Indian weather agencies also blame dust storms that originate in the Gulf.

Hearing Charlie Austin’s name sung with gusto at full-time by the pocket of away supporters was always Eddie Howe’s worst fear. The Bournemouth manager repeatedly tried and failed to buy the striker owing to a transfer embargo while he was on trial at the club from Poole Town in 2009, but made Austin his first signing at Burnley two years later. And here it was the Southampton man who cancelled out Ryan Fraser’s opener to earn a share of the spoils in this entertaining clash between two south coast neighbours.
This was a splendid advert for the Premier League but, in truth, it is a point that does little for either team, both of whom could have taken victory on another day. Mauricio Pellegrino had cited the “bigger picture” pre-match, owing to the gruelling December schedule – this was the first of seven matches for his side this month, and the first of eight for Bournemouth – so it was no surprise he made six changes from the team that came unstuck in the sixth minute of injury time against Manchester City in midweek. Two of which were enforced with Cédric Soares and Shane Long missing with hamstring and calf injuries respectively, so Jérémy Pied made his first league start since May at right-back while Austin ably filled the void up front.
Asked if there was an air of inevitably that Austin would score, Howe said: “I hoped not, he was bright. It was a nice cutback and a good finish by Charlie. If you put balls in the box and he comes alive ... we are disappointed we didn’t stop him.”
If there was a good chance of Austin scoring, then Nathan Redmond’s starring role – albeit off the bench – was perhaps just as predictable following his bizarre exchange with Pep Guardiola on Wednesday. Pellegrino, however, refuted the idea that the Southampton winger was affected by the pep talk. “I don’t think so,” he said. “One comment will not change the performance of one player or a team.
“I think he played well and our reaction in the second half was good, especially in wide areas. We could have scored a second, but we were really close.”
Howe, too, rang the changes here with all three second-half substitutes from the disappointing home defeat by Burnley – Adam Smith, Lewis Cook and Jermain Defoe – all handed starts here. Callum Wilson dropped to the bench and Harry Arter was left out of the matchday squad altogether, but not through injury. “He’s fit and available, but not selected,” Howe said.
Few, though, could have envisaged that it would be Smith, the marauding Bournemouth right-back, who would dominate the post-match agenda after he picked up his fifth booking of the season, for an alleged first-half dive according to the referee Jon Moss. Smith maximised contact but was tripped by Sofiane Boufal. “I spoke to the ref after and he apologised and said it was a penalty, but it’s frustrating,” said Smith, who will miss Bournemouth’s trip to Crystal Palace on Saturday.
At that point, Bournemouth badly needed a break after another sluggish start. Virgil van Dijk sent a free header from James Ward-Prowse’s outswinging corner sailing past of Asmir Begovic’s goal before Pied thrashed an effort wide from 30 yards. It took Bournemouth 20 minutes to stir. But when they did, Fraser Forster certainly knew it, with the Southampton goalkeeper called into action twice in quick succession. First, unknowingly, his left shoulder denied Defoe after the striker diverted Smith’s lashed effort goalwards before he then pushed clear Nathan Aké’s diving header. Then came Moss’s contentious decision.
Bournemouth were irked but continued to apply the pressure, with Charlie Daniels fizzing a rasping effort wide from 35 yards, one reminiscent to his rocket against Manchester City in August. The next Bournemouth attack, three minutes before the interval, finally found the Southampton net. When Wesley Hoedt dallied on the ball, Joshua King, pressing high up the field, stole possession and spread the ball across to Andrew Surman, who then shifted the ball over again for Fraser to emphatically sweep home. It had been coming, with Southampton too often complacent in defence. Saints, though, should have had an instant leveller, but Boufal blazed high and wide from Ryan Bertrand’s low cross.
Pellegrino summoned Redmond, who leapt to the defence of Guardiola after his peculiar pep talk, in place of Ward-Prowse at half-time. Fresh from Guardiola’s gushing praise, Redmond made an impressive instant impact. He then fed Austin for the equalising goal on the hour, with the striker smashing home his drilled cross at the front post for his third in as many matches. “The confidence of a striker is very difficult to train, or buy,” Pellegrino said. “You need experience of scoring goals, and when you have a player in this form it is good news.”
Both teams could have snatched a winner – the Bournemouth substitute Wilson could not react quickly enough to seize upon the rebound from King’s late strike, while Austin, lurking at the back post, failed to reach an overcooked Bertrand cross with the goal at his mercy.


Trevor Bayliss, the England head coach, insisted Joe Root harbours no regrets over the decision to put Australia in at Adelaide despite the hosts building a dominant first-innings total.
Root’s call at the toss on day one, perhaps guided by the two previous day-nighters here being won by the side batting second, had drawn comparisons with Nasser Hussain’s decision in Brisbane on the 2002-03 tour long before Steve Smith’s side declared on 442 for eight on the second evening.
Speaking after his side had sent down 149 overs across five sessions and then lost the wicket of Mark Stoneman before rain, Bayliss admitted Root has been forced to cope with the hand he has been dealt: an attack of right-arm fast-mediums that is lacking in variety and pace.
But asked if Root now wished he had opted to bat, given the uphill struggle the tourists now face in trying to avoid going 2-0 before Perth, Bayliss replied: “No, he wouldn’t do anything differently. It’s well documented that one of our challenges is taking wickets on flatter pitches. So Joe wanted to give our guys the best opportunity to take 20 wickets. It didn’t work out, although I thought we bowled pretty well. Look, it wasn’t an easy decision. It wasn’t taken lightly.
“ Another day, another two or three nicks might have had us in a different position. It might have evened it up from Trent Bridge two years ago when they nicked everything [Australia were bowled out for 60 after being inserted].”
Though the fast but fragile Mark Wood is set to play in the two-day tour match that starts in Perth on Saturday and precedes the third Test – he has recently returned with the Lions – doubts remain among the England management regarding the Durham quick’s durability over five days.
A more pressing worry is the bowling of Moeen Ali who, after a side-strain in the lead-up to the series and a cut to his spinning finger at the Gabba, has looked devoid of confidence with the ball and picked up only two wickets at 88 runs apiece from the three innings to date.
Asked where the all-rounder is fitness-wise, Bayliss replied: “His finger is OK, he bowled a number of overs [24] but there are no concerns over it, that’s for sure.”
England’s second day in the field at the Adelaide Oval was less spiky than the first, when Stuart Broad and Jimmy Anderson had sought out a running verbal battle with Smith to continue what has been a fractious start to the series.
Bayliss, though not a fan of sledging, admitted his personal preference is for on-field talk not to be broadcast to the wider world. He added: “It’s just the way the game is these days. I’d like to see the microphones turned down, I don’t think that’s necessarily a good thing for young kids watching.
“I don’t think anyone has to listen to what is being said. But it’s grown men playing a very competitive sport and sometimes those emotions boil over.”


“You beauty!” It did not require sophisticated lip-reading skills to understand Shaun Marsh when charging down the pitch in response to reaching three figures. Simple words from a straightforward character, coated with very real emotion from the most maligned player of his generation.
Marsh’s inclusion in this side could never be divorced from the fact that it is his eighth chance to prevail in the baggy green across seven years. But that charmed run looked to be over after Australia’s tour of India in March. Then, he lost both his place and national contract before the return trip to the subcontinent in August for a tour of Bangladesh.
The rationale used for his dumping was that Usman Khawaja needed to get some runs in the legs before the Ashes. Marsh, by contrast, was plainly not part of those plans. “I wasn’t too sure,” he said, reflecting on whether he thought his career was done. “But I am really happy I have got this last chance.” So were the Australian cricket faithful on this, his finest day as an international batsman.
That it was Adelaide’s horseshoe-shaped theatre where Marsh played the lead role was all the sweeter, because of his history here. In 2012, it was where his first stint as the national No3 ended when three Tests against India brought just 17 runs. The series served as a symbol for his career, that when he did not go big he could not be relied upon to contribute in the slightest.
But because of the way he accounted for himself this time around, the 34-year‑old showed depth and won respect. Just as it was for his captain, Steve Smith, last week, Marsh batted with impeccable patience and control to grind the visitors down. Like Smith, he shelved his natural fluent game in order to survive as long as he could. Like Smith, he was undefeated at the end.
Sure, he drove well, including through cover off Jimmy Anderson with the shot of the match so far. And yes, when the second new ball got softer he danced to dispatch the spin of Moeen Ali. Later, he pulled into a gap that barely existed to reach his fifth Test hundred. The highlights were there, but it was the partnerships he stitched together that mattered a lot more.
Failing to claim two wickets within nine overs of each other at any stage, England found it impossible to ever truly get on top. Where in the past Marsh has frequently been a feature of Australia collapses, on Sunday he added the glue to new stands rather than solvent.
Take the union he shared with Pat Cummins for the eighth wicket. With well over a session to bat before the floodlit hour when Australia wanted to unleash their quicks, there was work still to do. While the junior partner took 37 deliveries to get off the mark (the slowest for an Australian since 1991), Marsh dropped back a gear as they laid a foundation together.
The favour was returned, Cummins the perfect partner to support Marsh through the 80s and 90s in just the same way he had done for Smith in Brisbane. Along the way, the innings went beyond the length of Steve Waugh’s side in 2002, when Nasser Hussain won the toss and sent them in. By the dinner interval, England’s bowlers were tatty and fielders floundering. Now their job was done.
Earlier with Tim Paine, a similar application was demanded after they came together four deliveries into the day. They survived the best of Jimmy Anderson, who won leg before dismissals against both before technology decided otherwise. In Paine’s case, the way he hit the ball belied two painful blows to the finger he had broken many times. It was gutsy and effective.
“You like seeing those stories,” Chris Rogers said of the two veterans batting together. “People who just hang in, bide their time, get an opportunity and make the most of it.” Much like his own journey. By moving Australia forward by 85 runs at a point where Joe Root’s side had a chance to punch back hard on a fresh day, they had vindicated selectors’ controversial leap of faith at a vital time.
When Marsh was given the nod to let his hair down for a brief frolic before the inevitable declaration after dinner, he took it up with gusto. Smashing Stuart Broad back over his head for a 94-metre six punctuated the tourists’ pain in the most joyful way.
Smith and his deputy, David Warner, watched on from the viewing room side by side in their crisp jumpers and baggy greens, enjoying life as they were in the royal box at Wimbledon. It was fitting. For the trajectory this series is now on, an Ashes coronation for this Australia side could be coming sooner rather than later. With Marsh front and centre.
England fans have not had much to laugh about so far but there has been much amusement for the travelling support provided by Australia’s huge electronic scoreboards, which do a lot more than what they say on the tin. At regular intervals, blunt missives about crowd behaviour scream off the screen. “Patrons are advised disorderly or offensive conduct may result in eviction and on the spot fine of $560.” The cost of being a scallywag at Adelaide. Last week at the Gabba the more serious offence of running on the field was flashed up as being worth $8,000 (£4,500, give or take). The paternalistic Adelaide Oval went a step further to school fans on cricket etiquette – namely, not to walk in front of sightscreens during play. On the available evidence, fans of both sides are too busy drinking. Adam Collins
Declaration of intent
One of the highlights of any Test is the quality of television viewer polls, posing stumpers such as: “Which team will win?” Yesterday, the question on-screen before the dinner break asked whether Australia would declare. Meantime the camera showed the Australia dressing room, where Nathan Lyon sat padded up. An irony-laden slow wave of his batting gloves gave the answer loud and clear. Australia were batting on. Geoff Lemon
Adelaide is tickled pink
No Australian city does the Test festival vibe quite like Adelaide. Forget about the cricket, the enormous patch of grass behind the members’ enclosure – boasting boutique bars as far as the eye can see – is a social calendar institution for the city. The pink-ball experience has only added to the magic with 55,317 punters making it along on Saturday – the best attended day of cricket at the ground, eclipsing the record from the Bodyline summer. Another 52,201 came on Sunday. What’s next? For locals, their dream would be to see the Test return to its traditional spot on the calendar, coinciding with Australia Day on 26 January. Cricket Australia’s chief executive, James Sutherland, addressed that wish on radio, but noted it would mean Sri Lanka would visit next year instead of India, complicating matters somewhat. One thing seems certain: the after-dark fixture is set to remain a fixture here for years to come. “We’ve always felt it’s the natural venue for day-night Test cricket,” Sutherland said. “Going forward, we would see at least Brisbane and Adelaide as being day-night Test cricket venues.” Adam Collins


Anyone hoping to listen to live radio commentary of Liverpool’s decisive Champions League tie with Spartak Moscow on Wednesday will not be able to do so after the club made the decision to restrict audio access to the match to their official website.
Liverpool had been in negotiations with BBC Radio 5 Live, who along with Talksport broadcast Champions League matches in this country, about full commentary of the fixture since the 3-3 draw with Sevilla on 21 November, when a late collapse by Jürgen Klopp’s side denied them guaranteed qualification to the knockout stages of the competition and meant they require at least a draw against Spartak at Anfield to progress.
BBC 5 Live fully expected to secure the necessary rights, only to discover on Saturday that the club is limiting them to a reporter who can send brief updates and post-match interviews with the managers and players from both sides.
There is shock at the BBC over the decision, with one insider describing it as “monumentally restrictive” as it will deny a likely listener base of more than one million people the chance to listen to the Group E fixture as it unfolds via a traditional radio service. There is also the suspicion at the station that this is a taste of things to come as major clubs, and Liverpool in particular, look to take live broadcasting of their games, on TV as well as radio, in house.
Liverpool have defended the decision by pointing out that live commentary of each of their five Champions League group matches so far this season have been broadcast via their website and that access to the service for the Spartak match will, like with the others, be free. All would-be listeners have to do is register to the site.
Such a move does somewhat exclude non-Liverpool supporters who may want to listen to commentary of the game as they are unlikely to register to the club’s website to do so, and also excludes anyone who does not own a laptop/home computer/smartphone or access to the internet. Anyone who wants to watch live television coverage of the fixture will require BT Sport to do so, with the channel having retained exclusive rights to show Champions League fixtures in March.
Rights to live radio commentaries of Champions League matches in England are negotiated directly between broadcasters and clubs and done so on a game by game basis. BBC 5 Live has yet to do full commentary of one of Liverpool’s European games at Anfield this season, primarily because they have consistently played on the same evening as Tottenham Hotspur, whose fixtures, namely those against Real Madrid and Borussia Dortmund, have been more high profile. They did broadcast Liverpool draw with Sevilla last month, for which they did not have to pay a rights’ fee as it took place in Spain, and were confident of also having a commentary team on Merseyside in midweek, so much so that full live commentary of Liverpool v Spartak Moscow has already been listed on the schedule page of 5 Live’s website.
Liverpool insist that their decision is not the start of a process that will see an increasing restriction of live broadcast of their European matches to their official channels and that they will continue to make decisions on a game-by-game basis. Klopp’s team are guaranteed European football in the new year as even if they lose against Spartak, with whom they drew 1-1 in Moscow three months ago, the lowest they will finish in Group E is third, which would see them qualify instead for the Europa League.


Benevento gained their first ever point in Serie A thanks to an injury-time header from goalkeeper Alberto Brignoli, to earn a 2-2 draw in Gennaro Gattuso’s first game as Milan manager.
The club are playing in their first ever season in the Italian top flight but had lost each of their previous 14 games, and looked to be on their way to a 15th defeat with Milan leading in the 95th minute.
But Brignoli, the goalkeeper on loan at Benevento from Juventus, came up into the box for a Danilo Cataldi free-kick, and rose above the Milan defence to glance a header into the bottom corner.
“It’s difficult to describe,” said Brignoli. “I was thinking: ‘It’s 2-1, the 95th minute, we have nothing to lose.’ I went up there, closed my eyes and jumped. It would have been terrible to lose this, as we’ve lost so many at the last second that we really didn’t deserve to. Today we got some of that [luck] back. We’ve shown that we can play against anyone and just need the incidents to go our way.” Brignoli became the first goalkeeper to score in Serie A since Massimo Taibi for Reggina in 2001.
Milan, playing their first match since Gattuso replaced Vincenzo Montella as coach last Monday, twice led but were pegged back after Alessio Romagnoli was sent off for a second booking in the 75th minute.
Giacomo Bonaventura and Nikola Kalinic scored for Milan while George Puscas scored Benevento’s other goal.
“We conceded a strange goal and at the moment that’s just what our luck is,” said Gattuso. “We have a long way to go and a lot to improve. “It hurts. A stabbing would have been better than this goal. We’re Milan and we need to be better, because this isn’t enough.”
😱 ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE, WHEN YOU THINK YOU'VE SEEN IT ALL... 😱😮 INJURY TIME, GOALKEEPER DIVING HEADER EQUALISER 😮Sensational drama at Benevento 👏 pic.twitter.com/3q7qVYbvYU
Meanwhile, city rivals Inter took full advantage of their rivals’ continued slip-ups by taking over at the top of the table, with a 5-0 win over Chievo.
Ivan Perisic scored a hat-trick for Inter, opening the scoring in the 23rd minute before Mauro Icardi doubled his side’s advantage before half-time. Perisic added his second on 57 minutes and, after a Milan Skriniar header, the Croatian completed his hat-trick when he poked home a loose ball in injury time.
Fiorentina bounced back from four Serie A games without a win as they cruised to a 3-0 home win over struggling Sassuolo. Giovanni Simeone opened the scoring for the Viola just past the half-hour mark and further goals from Jordan Veretout and Federico Chiesa sealed victory.
A late goal from Mattia Destro salvaged a late point for Bologna in a 1-1 draw at home to Cagliari, who had led through João Pedro’s 42nd-minute effort.


The history of English cricket is littered with moments in the field when, almost to the imagined sound of Herb Alpert tootling out Spanish Flea on his trumpet, the car has shipped many of its constituent parts and is careering downhill at a pace.
On the second day at the Adelaide Oval, one that was dominated by Shaun Marsh’s maiden Ashes hundred and capped off by Mitchell Starc’s pinpoint location of Mark Stoneman’s front pad before the rain, the latest such entry came moments from dinner amid a chorus of local derision.
By this stage England were already well aware that their evening was heading for a late blitz under lights from Starc and co. Marsh, aided by the almost fraudulently placed No9, Pat Cummins, had combined for a punishing second session that had seen 103 runs shipped for the loss of one wicket and spirits were understandably low.
But with two balls to go, suddenly a lifter from Chris Woakes took the shoulder of the left-hander’s bat and the pink Kookaburra ballooned up behind. Weary eyes lit up. Alastair Cook at a solitary second slip and the gully, James Vince, were both on to it. The bowler, whose average away from home was continuing to swell, might somehow nab himself a consolation prize.
And yet what followed from England’s first-change was not a sheepish celebration but two arms held out aghast. Cook and Vince had collided in the dive, the right hand of the latter punching the ball from the former’s left to the delight of the Adelaide crowed. This, it is fair to say, was not the scenario envisaged when Joe Root decided to have a bowl five sessions earlier.
Root will doubtless wear that call for some time if this Test match and tour continue on their current trajectories. But, like captains who opt to bat first yet somehow dodge any stigma when their side collapses in a heap, he is still beholden to his players. And three innings into this Ashes series with the ball, the weapons at Root’s disposal look a concern.
England, truth be told (and perhaps most worryingly for Root), bowled better on the second day than the first. And yet despite an early flicker from Stuart Broad with the dismissal of Peter Handscomb third ball, and Jimmy Anderson seeing two lbws overturned on review, the cluster of wickets required never felt like coming once the, ahem, second new ball lost its lacquer.
In fact, where such surges will come from this series is becoming hard to divine, with batsman error appearing the plan with the old ball. Get past the main two and Australia know it gets easier, with Woakes and Craig Overton ever willing but, like most English seamers, the type of bowlers who still need some assistance. Moeen Ali, meanwhile, is simply not right.
The result in Australia’s first innings of 442 for eight declared here was all of the home side’s batsmen got set – at least by number of balls faced – with partnerships forming one after another. England’s attack has been picking up wickets at 52 runs apiece so far and, with Mark Wood perennially injured and Ben Stokes suspended, it remains fast‑medium at best.
Trevor Bayliss naturally insisted after stumps on the second day that his side can indeed create chances out here. But it was the head coach’s follow-up to this statement that was arguably the more revealing, when he added: “There’s no use wishing that someone else is going to come with a click of the fingers. That’s all we’ve got.”
Bayliss, not known to have spent many days watching county cricket, went on to add that pitches in England and the volume of cricket are perhaps not conducive to speed. England have won in Australia before without express bowlers, of course, but on the surfaces witnessed so far, it is starting to look as if the missing element required.
It was at the start of the reply that the difference between the two attacks really struck home as on the hi-def big screen at the Cathedral End, Starc’s initial loosener was clocked at 145.3kph. One ball in, after England’s attack had sent down 894, his was already the fastest delivery of the match.


For 79 minutes on Saturday, Arsenal were superb. In that spell, they had 32 shots to Manchester United’s five. They pummelled a team noted for their organisation, creating chance after chance. As Arsène Wenger underlined afterwards, they hammered them on the xG. They forced David de Gea into a Premier League record 14 saves. The problem was that by the time they began that spell, they were 2-0 down.
There is an entire chapter in Alex Ferguson’s last but one book devoted to Wenger and how predictable he found Arsenal, how easy they were to counter-attack. Wenger claimed last week that his switch to a back three had helped alleviate that, offeringgreater defensive stability.
That seemed, even at the time, like a hostage to fortune and so it proved: all three United goals were the result of Arsenal losing possession. The third was understandable, the ball lost high up the pitch as Arsenal chased the game – although they had been given a warning a few minutes earlier with a Jesse Lingard effort that ended up being deflected on to the crossbar by Petr Cech – but the first two were not. Whatever the tactical approach, whatever grand designs the managers may have, a team who give the ball away as cheaply as that twice in their final third is going to have problems.
United were admirably efficient, it’s true, seizing on the gifts Arsenal gave them. The link-up of the front three of Romelu Lukaku, Anthony Martial and Lingard was exceptional. As at Watford on Tuesday, the sense was of a much slicker trio than when Henrikh Mkhitaryan or Marcus Rashford play off the front man. Pogba’s role in that, linking the back and front of the team, is hugely significant while Lingard is coming more and more to seem like one of those players whose attributes are hard to define but who regularly has a decisive impact on games.
Yet whatever satisfaction their interaction brings United there was also the oddity of a Mourinho side, for the second time in a week, taking a seemingly comfortable early lead and then only just holding on to it. Whether Mourinho had intended to pursue his notorious template for big away matches – the “he who has the ball has fear” doctrine outlined by Diego Torres in his biography of the coach – is impossible to say: the game was out of control from the off and remained so until Pogba was sent off. Anything, it seemed, could have happened.
In that sense it could not be portrayed as some sort of tactical masterclass – from an attacking point of view this was probably as well as Arsenal have played against a Mourinho team. And yet as soon as Pogba had been sent off, Mourinho closed the game down. United stopped offering a threat on the counter, held their shape and, other than the Danny Welbeck penalty appeal, largely stymied Arsenal. It was as though Mourinho could have killed the game at any moment, it’s just that, with the chances United were creating on the break, he did not feel it necessary.
It was notable as well, after all that had been said about the back three last week, that when Shkodran Mustafi went off, having been injured in the challenge that led to United’s second goal, Wenger did not use Per Mertesacker as a straight replacement but brought on Alex Iwobi and switched to a 4-2-3-1. Perhaps he simply reasoned that at 2-0 down he needed the extra forward and he had to sacrifice some defensive cover in the knowledge that a Mourinho side was unlikely to be overly aggressive in the circumstance.
The result was Arsenal having a lot of the ball in dangerous areas 30-40 yards from the United goal as United’s two central midfielders, Pogba and Nemanja Matic, were outnumbered. That did not necessarily lead to clear‑cut chances – 15 of Arsenal’s 33 shots in the game were from outside the box – but it did feel significant that when Mourinho went to shut the game down, he brought on Ander Herrera for Martial to add an extra body in that area. Given how strong Manchester City are in midfield, that is perhaps a concern for United before the derby, but without Pogba they would have been forced to use a more obviously defensive presence in that zone anyway.
But this was a game that seemed more about psychology than tactics. Mourinho, since his earliest days as a coach, has always spoken of the need to generate the right mindset in his players so they take the right decisions without them having to be pre‑programmed or endlessly practised. The three goals suggested that is close to being achieved at Old Trafford. Arsenal, meanwhile, continue in their age-old habit of making the wrong decisions at precisely the wrong times, undermining themselves before the contest has really begun.


The weightlifter Naim Süleymanoğlu escaped the communist oppression of his native Bulgaria by evading the agents detailed to keep an eye on him while he was competing at the world championships in Australia in 1986; he did this by hiding in the toilets at a Melbourne restaurant. He was flown into exile in Turkey and went on to play a significant role in the cross-border movement of hundreds of thousands of Bulgarian ethnic Turks, as well as becoming his new nation’s most celebrated sportsman.
Süleymanoğlu, who has died aged 50 from a haemorrhage after liver failure, was named best weightlifter of the 20th century by the sport’s governing body, and was in Reuters’ top 12 Olympians across all sports, named in 2012. Because of his change of nationality, and the global publicity that went with it, he had more influence beyond sport than any of the other 11.
His family were among the 900,000 ethnic Turks in Bulgaria forced to change their names in the mid-1980s when Turkish schools and mosques were closed. Speaking their own language was forbidden as Bulgaria’s communist regime strove to eliminate Turkish culture within the country.
A false newspaper report claiming that he had denied his Turkish heritage infuriated Süleymanoğlu, whose name had been changed against his will to Naum Shalamanov. He planned his escape a year in advance, though he did not tell his family, as his phone was tapped and agents followed him everywhere.
He was celebrating his victory at the world championships in Melbourne when he escaped for a secretly planned meeting with a local man of Turkish descent. When Turgut Özal, the Turkish prime minister, who would later become president, heard that Süleymanoğlu was free, he organised transport first to London, and then by private jet to Istanbul and Ankara. Ozal’s son Ahmet said agents of MIT, Turkey’s national intelligence service, had outwitted the Bulgarian agents detailed to watch Süleymanoğlu. “This story could be an espionage movie,” he said.
Özal ensured Süleymanoğlu was handsomely rewarded for his many victories, with flats, cars and cash. He also provided him with bodyguards for competitions abroad. The most significant of these victories was the Olympic title at Seoul in 1988, the first of three. It would probably have been four had Bulgaria not joined the Soviet bloc boycott of the 1984 Games in Los Angeles, for although he was only 17 at the time Süleymanoğlu had already broken world records, at 4ft 11in earning the nickname the “Pocket Hercules”.
Nationality regulations forbade Süleymanoğlu from competing for Turkey in Seoul without Bulgaria’s permission. Özal negotiated a deal with the Bulgarians that cost Turkey more than $1m. Süleymanoğlu broke six world records in Seoul, and his total of 342.5kg was 30kg clear of his nearest rival. A national holiday was declared when he returned to Turkey, and a sports centre, park and street were named after him.
His exploits, and the story of how he came to represent Turkey, made headlines around the world. Süleymanoğlu was featured on the front cover of Time magazine; he was invited to the White House by the US president, Ronald Reagan; and he spoke of the Bulgarian Turks’ plight. Within eight months of his visit to Washington, more than 300,000 of them were allowed to leave on special passports valid only for exit to Turkey. Among them were Süleymanoğlu’s parents, whom he had not seen for two years.
His unusual body proportions – his forearms were the same length as his upper arms and his torso the same length as his legs – gave Süleymanoğlu the perfect physique for weightlifting. He put it to such good effect that he set dozens of world records, mostly in the 60kg and 64kg featherweight classes, and is one of the select few to have raised more than three times his own body weight above his head.
Born in Momchilgrad, southern Bulgaria, he was one of three brothers. His father, Süleyman, a bus and train driver, and mother, Hatice, both stood under 5ft. Naim was taken from home aged 10 to train relentlessly, starting at two hours a day and building up, by the time he was 15, to eight hours a day, under the coaching of Ivan Abadjiev, known as “the Butcher”. Abadjiev was tough, unforgiving, innovative and remarkably successful.
Süleymanoğlu did all that was asked of him, and when the two met after his defection they did so in friendship and mutual respect. Süleymanoğlu remained popular in Bulgaria, whose government sent representatives to his funeral.
After winning the 1989 world championships in Athens, one of his seven world titles, Süleymanoğlu said he had had enough. “I have never been a child,” he would say. “I envy children; everything I remember is only training and championships. I gained gold medals, and I lost my childhood.”
Süleymanoğlu was constantly in the newspapers, photographed in nightclubs with various girlfriends. He smoked and drank; his mother said he needed a wife. He retired from competition, but when Özal told him, “This country needs you,” he returned in 1991 to train for the Barcelona Olympics the next year, and won again.
He made it three Olympic titles in Atlanta in 1996, holding off the challenge of his great friend and rival Valerios Leonidis, of Greece, with more world records. An attempt to win again in Sydney in 2000 failed when Süleymanoğlu, who had not prepared well, failed with his first three attempts and did not register a total. It was an inglorious farewell, after which he dabbled unsuccessfully in politics, held various roles for the Turkish weightlifting federation, and continued to have fun. Stories about his drinking appeared more frequently.
He did not marry, but in a 2014 interview he said he had four daughters born between 1991 and 2001. Three attended his funeral; the fourth lives in Japan. He is survived by his children and his mother.

After almost two days of sedate torment for England in the field, the match came alive for 45 minutes of Technicolor cricket as darkness descended. England were batting now. And this was suddenly a compelling spectacle, if an uncomfortable one, for the thousands of English supporters in Adelaide.
When Australia were at the crease it was more of a grind to watch. England were skilfully and methodically worn down by superbly disciplined Australian batsmanship, headed by Shaun Marsh, who hit an unbeaten 126. Only at the end did the home side attack with abandon just before declaring on the formidable score of 442 for eight.
Then a different game ensued: red-blooded, pink-balled cricket in which Mitchell Starc, Josh Hazlewood and, for one ball, Pat Cummins raced up to the wicket, testing the nerve and skill of England’s openers in this wonderful arena, which was suddenly transformed into a South Australian Colosseum. This was not the time to loiter out the back for a bite of cheese and a glass of local red.
Starc, in particular, bowled quickly; the English batsmen tried to counter purposefully. The odd ball whistled past the outside edge; occasionally the pace of the deliveries surprised Tim Paine behind the stumps. This is, apparently, why the stout-hearted opener plays the game. Briefly Mark Stoneman raced along at almost a run a ball. Then a full-length delivery thudded into his pads. Up went the umpire’s finger, the batsman’s review was to no avail and the Australians could celebrate scalp No1.
There followed a concerted appeal from Cummins’s first delivery for a catch behind the stumps when Alastair Cook was on strike. The slip cordon sprinted towards the umpire Aleem Dar in celebration but he remained unmoved. We waited for the review to be summoned. Curiously it never was. Then there was a remarkable anti-climax for the home side and their supporters and relief for England. Out of the night sky came a short, sharp shower that was sufficiently strong for play to be abandoned for the day. Cook and the newly arrived James Vince were spared having to bat at night any longer. Even so, after two days of this Test, England’s quest to retain the Ashes is in some disarray.
Sage cricketing observers have this sixth sense: they know that when a captain who has inserted the opposition is contemplating the pluses and minuses of taking the third new ball the plan has gone a little awry. In fact, Joe Root did not have to make that decision since Australia declared 11 overs before it was available. However, there were other indicators that his gamble at the toss had not paid off. In my notebook there is written the question: “Where’s Malan with his leg-breaks?”
It all started so promisingly for England on Sunday morning. Peter Handscomb was lbw in the first over of the day and Stuart Broad was so pumped up that he let out a roar from a distance of five feet from the dismissed batsman. I am not sure this is good form and there was the chance that the match referee, who appears on the big screen as Richard Richardson – Richie (from Antigua) to anyone who knows the game – might take a dim view of Broad’s celebration.
Jimmy Anderson threatened briefly. Twice he experienced the joy of seeing the umpire (Chris Gaffaney) raising his finger after an lbw shout, the first time against Marsh, the second against Paine. Twice the review showed that his deliveries were going over the top of the stumps. Even Anderson conjured a rare wry smile – for a second or two. No doubt the Australian captain was guffawing in the dressing room.
Soon Paine had overtaken Marsh, aided by a pulled drive over mid-wicket for six off Moeen Ali. Both Marsh and Paine kept their selectors smiling. Before the Brisbane Test their recalls to the team were heavily criticised, primarily by those in the south-eastern states where most people live – especially the sophisticates. Marsh is from Western Australia; Paine is from Tasmania. Both have performed superbly so far.
Just before the break Paine pulled a short ball from Craig Overton into the hands of Moeen at deep square leg after hitting a skittish 57. Then after the interval Starc miscued a pull shot against Broad and Australia had sunk to 311 for seven. That was the last wicket to fall in the middle session.
Initially Cummins blocked furiously alongside Marsh; it took him 37 balls to get off the mark. But eventually Root ran out of ammunition. Moeen could make no impact and Cummins, an invaluable No9, gradually became more offensive. Meanwhile, Marsh calmly kept going. Just before dinner he completed his fifth Test century and his first against England with a perfectly placed pull off Chris Woakes.
After dinner Australia had a quick heave. Cummins was caught at third man to give Overton his third Test wicket and there followed an ugly piece of cricket when Nathan Lyon received a succession of bouncers from Broad. In this series when the tailenders are batting we are witnessing bodyline with fielding restrictions, whichever side is bowling – though it is obviously the case that the Australian bowlers can propel much faster bouncers. The umpires are not inclined to intervene and, as with sledging, it appears that the era when the captains were the ones who decide where the line should be drawn has long since passed. That is a pity but that is the way they want to play it.


December was the month that found Manchester City out last year and, though history does not look like repeating itself with Pep Guardiola’s side on the verge of equalling a Premier League record for consecutive wins within a season, the runaway league leaders need to be wary of a seven-game month that includes a derby.
Twelve months ago it was Chelsea, on their own record-equalling 13 match winning run, who came to the Etihad and inflicted the first home defeat of the season with a 3-1 win. City were still shell-shocked a week later when they turned up at Leicester in some disarray and were taught lessons in a 4-2 defeat that Guardiola remembers vividly to this day.
To get the statistical details out of the way first, City have won every game in the Premier League since Ronald Koeman’s Everton held them to a draw at the Etihad in August. Their sequence stands at 12, and should they beat West Ham at home on Sunday afternoon they will advance to 13 and share the record jointly held by Arsenal (from 2001-02) and Chelsea (last season).
The actual record for consecutive Premier League wins stands at 14 but it was set over two seasons, by Arsenal between February and August 2002. Should City beat West Ham they can look at setting a fresh record all of their own, though the league game that follows is against Manchester United at Old Trafford.
We can expect to hear a lot from Guardiola about the unimportance of such trivialities as records between now and then, as well as a certain amount of exasperation on the subject of going through the season unbeaten, for what every manager knows is that the next game is always the one that might trip you up. Even if the next game is West Ham. If anyone from Guardiola’s scouting team was watching the Irons in action at Goodison in midweek there was precious little on show to cause any undue concern, though the one thing that might knock City off track is looking too far ahead and taking results against struggling sides for granted.
With due respect to Joe Hart and Pablo Zabaleta, who will be returning to Manchester in more straitened circumstances than was perhaps envisaged, West Ham are struggling at the moment and David Moyes does not yet seem to have a handle on how to turn things around. They were missing Andy Carroll at Everton, yet to start using that as an excuse is possibly to admit that Moyes does not have a great deal of attacking options open to him. Hart, who cannot feature under the terms of his loan deal, and Zabaleta left to join Slaven Bilic and most people – Marko Arnautovic, say – probably imagined a fairly comfortable mid-table existence based on the ability to occasionally summon the West Ham spirit and carry out bandit raids on supposedly superior sides.
In fact this happened only once, with the memorable comeback against Tottenham at Wembley in the Carabao Cup, and because league points are a much harder currency than cup kudos Bilic was soon gone, and with him much of what was left of the optimism surrounding the club.
Hiring Moyes on a six-month contract hardly screams optimism, does it? It simply means the manager will be easy to remove if there is no sign of climbing out of trouble, and suggests West Ham will soon be in the market for a new manager again whether or not Moyes can make a difference to results. The more pessimistic West Ham fans are already comparing the situation to Sunderland and complaining that Moyes might have to be removed before the end of the season, which is perhaps a little harsh after three matches though fair in the sense that any detectable improvement is hard to identify.
Neither does there seem much possibility of immediate respite. After Manchester City, Moyes must prepare his players for league encounters with Chelsea and Arsenal. A trip to Stoke a week on Saturday is the first game West Ham might mark down as winnable; in fact, given that Mark Hughes’s side are lining up among the relegation candidates this season, there might be trouble for Moyes if some sort of corner has not been turned by that stage.
Unless he simply wants to collect his contract money and fade away from frontline management, now is the time for Moyes to prove people wrong by showing his credentials as a firefighter. To do that you need to win games that you are not supposed to win, to pick up points against the big clubs. Moyes was never particularly good at that during his time at Everton, even though he more than stabilised the club over the course of 11 years, and his last experience of attempting to keep a side up ended in relegation.
If taking points from West Ham’s next three matches seems a tall order, Moyes could take some encouragement from what happened at Crystal Palace under Sam Allardyce last season. Allardyce has just earned a chance at a record seventh Premier League club on the strength of his apparent immunity to relegation, even if Everton possibly acted hastily in assuming the drop was looming.
Everyone knows Allardyce kept the Eagles up by virtue of going to Chelsea and Liverpool and winning, not to mention beating Arsenal 3-0 at home, but those results were all in April. In January, the month after he joined, Palace lost at home to Swansea and Everton and were drubbed at West Ham. As late as February Palace were hammered 4-0 at home by Sunderland.
Moyes must remember that; it is probably the last time he smiled. Two successive relegations would be nothing to smile about – not many managerial careers would survive it – yet there is still time and plenty of matches. Moyes won’t have to play Manchester City every week, but he will have to start somewhere.


How did Arsenal not win this match? Actually scratch that. How did Arsenal not win this match 6-3, or at the very least end up drawing it? This is not a rhetorical question. There is an answer. The main reason this didn’t happen and why instead Manchester United were able to extract a stirring, ruthlessly executed 3-1 away win is because David de Gea produced a performance of relentless brilliance in goal.
For an hour at the Emirates, as Arsenal surged back from the indignity of conceding a 2-0 deficit, De Gea was a one-man spider’s web, leaping and tumbling and spreading his limbs with startling grace and agility to keep Arsenal at bay.
Most notably there was a mind-boggling double-save 11 minutes into the second half, De Gea plunging with whip-crack speed to get a hand to Alexandre Lacazette’s low shot, then leaping up to deflect Alexis Sánchez’s follow-up over the bar.
This was goalkeeping that seemed to bend the normal physical rules, that defied any sense of reasonable cause and effect. As De Gea ambled off to retrieve the ball Arsenal’s players looked genuinely pained not to have scored, ready to appeal, fruitlessly, to the referee, or the fourth official, or God.
Except at the Emirates God was wearing a turquoise shirt and playing in goal for the visitors. With United 2-0 up early on, there was a brilliant first-half save from Lacazette that almost got lost in the scramble, De Gea showing bravery and outstanding reflexes to deflect the ball up on to the bar from point-blank range.
Shortly afterwards he produced something just as hair-raising. Romelu Lukaku, defending in extremis at the back post, propelled the ball towards his own goal off a shin. De Gea leapt, adjusted in mid air and clawed it away with the spatial awareness of an Olympic diver.
Afterwards Arsène Wenger mused on fairness in football, but was honest enough to put the blame for defeat on his own players’ lack of ruthlessness. Plus, of course, goalkeepers have always been the most deceptive of random elements in football. A good or bad goalkeeper skews and remakes the narrative, just as here De Gea’s brilliance helped turn a dominant performance from Arsenal into a home team picked off with surgical brilliance on the break.
Make no mistake, this was a tide that for long periods seemed to surge only one way. Arsenal made 562 passes to United’s 147. Arsenal had 12 corners to United’s one, 75% of possession, and 33 shots to United’s eight. Running under all this like a constant riff, De Gea made 14 saves across 90 minutes.
It is hard to remember a routine one. Some were almost throwaway moments of brilliance, an everyday plunge down to palm away, a bog-standard last-ditch block with the legs. De Gea has an endearing habit after each save of simply standing up and mooching off back into position, while lesser goalkeepers might be up on their feet punching the air, roaring with triumph, high-fiving the nearest team‑mate.
But then he plays so well so often that the idea of goalkeepers altering the way a game should or would have gone starts to fall apart. Goalkeepers are, after all, part of the team too, in many ways the most important bit. Every great team tends to have a great goalie.
As do some almost-there teams, like this evolving Mourinho United, who were also thrillingly decisive in attack when the moments came. It was that kind of game. For the opening 10 minutes United were brutally efficient in taking a 2-0 lead. For an hour they were reliant on the maniac in the gloves to keep Arsenal to just the one in reply from Lacazette. Finally United were dogged and depleted, Paul Pogba having capped an otherwise fine performance by getting himself sent off for a stamp on Héctor Bellerín.
For all that, the opening goal arrived with disarming ease as Arsenal’s defence collapsed at the first hint of pressure like a fine-milled wafer biscuit dunked in a mug of boiling tea. Pogba gave the scoring pass, but the author of the goal was Laurent Koscielny, whose horrible cross-field waft was intercepted by Antonio Valencia.
Pogba paused, drew three defenders and played a perfect little back-spun nudge to Valencia. His low shot went through first Nacho Monreal’s legs and then those of Petr Cech for a double Ecuadorian nutmeg – always a popular thing at this time of year in the coffee chains of north London.
Seven minutes later Jesse Lingard added a second, helped by Anthony Martial’s wonderful reverse pass. In the second half there was another for Lingard after a fine break. In between it was over to De Gea who just kept plunging and grasping and clawing away, always with a bit of a shrug, producing in the process surely one of the great Premier League goalkeeping performances.


Gianni Infantino in Moscow: advising “western media” to show some respect. “Do not try to paint with a dark paint everything that comes from the east – from Russia or the Arab world.” His view on endemic state-imposed doping: “It’s speculation.”
• Informing Infantino’s stance on Russia: Vitaly Mutko, deputy prime minister – unhappy with western media “distorting reality” by planting fake news. “We’re a good partner of the world sports movement. Why must you trample Russia under foot?”
• Infantino’s other best advice last week: western media shouldn’t overplay concern about racism next summer, because Fifa’s anti-racism policy means “no incidents will happen“. Helping shape the policy: Russia 2018 racism tsar Alexei Smertin, who explained in 2015 how, “when fans give bananas to black guys, it’s just for fun. I think the media gives the wrong image of Russia.”
From week three of the New York Fifa trial: claims that former Fifa vice-president Julio Grondona, who died in 2014, liked to take bribes under his code name “The Pope”, and have co-conspirators “kiss his gold ring” inscribed “Anything Goes”. Grondona denied fraud in 2011, condemning “the English press pirates … We always have these attacks from England. Their journalism is more busy lying than telling the truth.”
• Defending Grondona’s reputation last month: son Humberto – offering advice to a key prosecution witness, Argentinian businessman Alejandro Burzaco. “When the trial ends he should stay in New York. He shouldn’t try to come back here. People wouldn’t like that. He’s going to hell, for sure.”
a) Paraguay’s former Conmebol head Nicolás Leoz, appealing against his extradition to the US, four years after he lamented media intrusion: “What is it that drives these people?” b) Former Greek FA president Vassilis Gagatsis, denying wrongdoing after being arrested over the alleged misuse of £760,000 in disaster relief aid; and c) Philip Chiyangwa, millionaire Zimbabwe FA head, attacking “flagrant press lies” about his long-term ethics record: “I’m bona fide... I’ve never been involved in chicanery.”
10 Nov: The Gambia’s government suspends the nation’s FA board over alleged “serious fraud and criminal dealings”. 23 Nov: Fifa accuses the government of “undue interference” in FA affairs and threatens to ban their teams from world football unless the suspension is lifted. 30 Nov: The government lifts the suspension and FA executives return to work. All deny wrongdoing.
Boris Johnson’s spokesman, defending the ex-mayor’s work in renting out the London Stadium to West Ham for a £2.25m-a-season loss plus free public money for corner flags: “No other city has an Olympic legacy like London’s – and that is down to Boris and his team.”
• Johnson’s vision for the legacy talks, as set out in 2012: “It’s all a question of making sure that [the value of] a public asset, something taxpayers put half a billion pounds into, is properly reflected. People will understand: it’s my job is to get the best possible deal for the taxpayer.”
La Liga head Javier Tebas: finalising his legal action over PSG’s Qatari state funding. Tebas says people must “think of the victims: the clubs that must compete with PSG” – including Barcelona, who made €171m from Qatari state sponsorship from 2010 to 2016. “It’s really very harmful.”
Brazil, 8 Nov: Vasco president Eurico Miranda wins re-election on a “traditional values”, anti-gay, anti-women, pro‑transparency ticket. 29 Nov: Fails to appear in front of investigators over alleged “electoral fraud and irregularities”. Miranda’s lawyer: “The president did not attend for personal reasons.” He denies wrongdoing.
Sam Allardyce, 15 Nov: “[Everton] just didn’t feel right. You want people to be decisive – you want to feel like they want you.” 26 Nov: “At the moment going back into football isn’t on the agenda. I’m enjoying my life more than you’d believe.” 30 Nov: Signs £9m 18-month deal.
Spain, 31 Oct: Las Palmas president Miguel Ángel Ramírez dismisses talk of sacking coach Paco Ayestarán. “It just isn’t serious, this idea that you wouldn’t give the coach time to instil his ideas. The coach stays.” 30 Nov: The coach goes.
Brazil: Ponte Preta coach Eduardo Baptista, left “without words” after defender Rodrigo was sent off for “twice introducing his middle finger between the buttocks of the No22”. The red card led to a 3-2 defeat, relegation and a riot. Baptista: “Betrayal? It’s a strong word. But some players are beyond my reach.”
Romania: Politehnica Iasi coach Eugen Trica, banned for reacting to having two players sent off by walking across the pitch during play and “leaving the arena”. Trica told authorities he left “due to belly ache”; officials fined him £750 for “disrespect”.
Belgium: Standard Liège coach Ricardo Sa Pinto, facing FA charges for an alleged “vaudeville display” after a plastic beer cup landed near his foot. Sa Pinto denied he “overplayed” the incident by collapsing, calling for medical help, then abusing the referee. “It’s easy to criticise, but my shoes and trousers were wet. But hey, I get up and carry on. I’m a fighter.”


Sam Underhill is the epitome of the modern professional rugby player: self-motivated, clean-cut, talented and driven. The 21-year-old Bath flanker, who was one of the standout players in England’s autumn international series, lives for the moment rather than tomorrow even though he suffered a second concussion of the season 16 minutes into the victory over Australia.
“I guess it is an occupational hazard, but it is not something you can afford to worry about per se,” he says. “You tackle people with your shoulders and your head is next to your shoulders. It is impossible to be an aggressive tackler and not risk getting your head caught.
“It is a case of picking and choosing moments and finding other ways to tackle: it is easier for bigger guys because they do not have to rely on technique much. For shorter players like me, our tackle height is lower and you are then at more risk of getting your head somewhere it shouldn’t be.”
A year ago, Underhill was playing for Ospreys in the then Pro 12, unavailable for England because of the rule governing players who are not contracted to a Premiership club. After announcing he was joining Bath this season, a flanker seen as the solution to the long-time search for a specialist openside played for England against the Barbarians at Twickenham in late May and won his first cap in the second Test in Argentina on 17 June.
It was against the Pumas last month that Underhill announced himself, thudding into one ball-carrier after another after sizing up his prey. Everything he did smacked of deliberation, taking what he did in training on to the field, and he is not a player who runs on emotion. He completed 20 tackles and was one of the few candidates for the man of the match, but his fearlessness in contact led to him being concussed on his Bath debut against Northampton and again against the Wallabies.
“The majority of laws are there to protect the ball-carrier, rightly so, but the flipside is the tackler is not as protected. They have rightly lowered tackle height and refereed high tackles very well and the law changes have had a real effect on the game. The downside is if you drop your body, your head is in a place where there is more force coming through from the ball-carrier, but I do not see how you can change the game to make it not so; it would not be rugby.”
Underhill does not want to be seen merely as a defender. It was 65 minutes before he had the ball in his hands against Argentina at Twickenham, part of the move that led to England’s second try.
“Attack is something I need to work on and I have some awesome guys to learn from in Bath, like Taulupe Faletau and Francois Louw,” he says. “There is always space on the field and when you have 15 players comfortable handling the ball, you will get into it a lot easier: it is better to play out of structure and look what is in front of you. You will always lean towards things you are better at, but I am keen to work on my handling game. Defence is important, but making 20 tackles means the other team had the ball.
“Big tackles are great, but in terms of the game they are not the be-all and end-all. You do not just want to be known as a guy who is a big hitter because that does not make you a good defender, it makes you a good tackler when things are in your favour.
“Being good at something means being able to make a decision and if there is only one thing you can do well, you cannot make a decision. Defence is like attack: doing the same thing all the time does not make you effective. It is a bit of a youth thing: when you are you are young you are fresh and feel good physically, not having experienced what it is like to be on the end of a few games. That is why being able to learn from Chris Robshaw and Dylan Hartley, who are where they are for a reason, is massively important.”
Underhill hopes to be fit for Bath’s European Champions Cup match at Toulon on Saturday but, even though the Six Nations is only two months away, he is not thinking about taking part in the tournament for the first time. He knows he can look forward to Bath’s Premiership match against Leicester, The Clash, at Twickenham on 7 April, with the club looking to build on last season’s attendance of just under 62,000, but he has disciplined himself not to contemplate the home matches against Ireland and Wales as the World Cup draws closer.
“If you had asked me a year ago where I thought I would be now, I would not have said this,” he says. “A lot of people on the outside see the jump but not the stuff that goes in between, all the training sessions and communication with the coaches. I have really enjoyed it: you try not to think about stuff that is out of your control, like selection, and when you have your opportunity you have to take it, always being at your best. I have relished being involved with England, but every time you go there might be your last and I will never take my involvement for granted. A big part of the setup is building relationships with people you would not otherwise: the best teams are the ones who get on together off the field the best.
“I speak to Eddie [Jones, the England coach] a bit, although if he does not text you that is probably a good thing. You can be hard when you are at the level Eddie is at. Maybe in a club environment it would not work, but an international side is not a club. When you go into camp you have the best players who are the most motivated to train and play. Everyone is there for a reason and you can expect that standard from people. You are only there for a short period. It is short and intense. Eddie is about getting better every time you go there. We have done so far and it is a really good environment.
“He talks a lot about being comfortable with being uncomfortable. That is the best way to learn: when you do not have time to relax, you have to be on the ball. When you have a walk-through lineout session, you are expected to know all the detail. There is no room for complacency, which is how you produce such a high quality of training. To be the best team in the world, you have to expect to win games.”


Europe’s defeat in the Solheim Cup was comprehensive, leading to concern as to how the gap to the United States could be adequately bridged. In the midst of a grim picture, though, Georgia Hall emerged as a debutant star; the 21-year-old from Bournemouth belied her inexperience and was trusted to appear in all five Solheim sessions. “Georgia performed beautifully,” said Europe’s captain, the much-decorated Annika Sorenstam.
“When I think back, I remember it all,” says Hall when considering August’s events in Iowa. “I knew it would be amazing but I didn’t actually know it would be as good as it was. It was an incredible experience throughout every minute. I already cannot wait for two years’ time; once you play in one, you just want to stay in the team for the rest of your career.
“All your golf career you are on your own, it is just you. To actually be with someone else, to be paired with someone by a captain, before you even tee off you feel like there is a partnership and trust. That is quite special.”
Hall’s pause for reflection is timely. She tees off in Dubai on Wednesday for the final event of the Ladies European Tour season with the order of merit title already secure. In the aftermath, she will allow herself the holiday she hasn’t been on since the age of six. “I think it will be nice to chill out and celebrate the season I’ve had,” she says of a six-week break from golf.
How Hall has earned it. She did not emerge from anything remotely resembling an affluent background, meaning serious and regular sacrifices to reach the top. But did such a dedicated approach – it seems no coincidence Tiger Woods was her childhood hero – deny Hall the natural enjoyment or recklessness of youth?
“That was especially the case when I was younger, say from 12 to 18,” she says. “I didn’t really spend time with friends, I was just practising. That has all definitely paid off. I don’t really miss stuff like that because I never had it, I don’t really know what it is like.
“I love golf so much, I love travelling, I love playing in tournaments. I enjoyed the journey to get into a Solheim Cup team, for example, and that became something I was totally focused on. Doing anything else didn’t really interest me. I don’t feel I have lost out anymore; maybe when I was younger, only going to school for half a day before practising, that could be true but I would do it all over again. It is paying off; I love what I do, if I didn’t I wouldn’t do this.”
Hall’s third place in the Women’s British Open provided another breakthrough of sorts. It was especially laudable given the venue, Kingsbarns, was completely new to her. “That tournament is No1 on my list every year,” says Hall. “I’d played really well in the Scottish Open the week before so was confident, got myself in a good position within two days and just told myself: ‘Keep in this.’ I managed to do that, which proved to me that I can win a major and especially a British Open.”
Hall’s understated style, along with her talent, should be cherished. The trappings associated with fame are not a consideration. “Getting attention doesn’t really concern me. I quite like doing my own thing and playing golf. I don’t do this for the recognition of it.”
It seems ludicrous, though, that Hall will head to Dubai with season earnings of just under £350,000. Tommy Fleetwood, after all, collected more than £4.4m when sealing the male equivalent. Yet Hall refuses to cite unfair disparity.
“I can’t do anything about that,” she says. “All I could have done is try to be top of the order of merit, which I have. I can’t be annoyed about what I can’t control or do anything about. It is nice to earn good money but that’s not why I’m out here. I don’t see it as a massive problem; it’s not like another woman is playing against me for different prize money.”
The riches available on the LPGA Tour in the United States are, however, within touching distance. “When I was growing up I said I’d like to turn pro at 18, which I did,” Hall says. “Then I said I wanted to spend two or three years on the European Tour. There wasn’t a rush, I wanted to make that progression. I have now learnt a lot, I didn’t want to go to the LPGA Tour if I didn’t think I could do well there. I think I’m ready now.
“Experience has been so important for me and mentally I have improved more than anything, which has led to the results of this year. I know myself more now, I know my golf game a lot more now.”
The proof of this has arrived from results. Whether she chooses to address it or not, Hall is worthy of more attention than has thus far been the case.


Miguel Cotto’s planned valedictory lap to close a decorated 17-year professional career ended in surprise on Saturday when he suffered a unanimous-decision loss to Brooklyn’s Sadam Ali at Madison Square Garden.
So distant an afterthought was Ali entering Saturday’s fight that he scarcely warranted a mention on the poster advertising the bout. But the 29-year-old son of Yemeni immigrants from Brooklyn hurt the crowd favorite in the second and fourth rounds, weathered Cotto’s best onslaughts in the middle act and held on to capture the Puerto Rican icon’s WBO junior middleweight title before a stunned audience of 12,391.
What had been sold as a celebration of one of boxing’s classiest and most understated champions instead became an unexpected coronation as Ali, a 2008 US Olympian who moved up from welterweight to challenge for Cotto’s title, scored a career-best win over the first and only Puerto Rican man to win belts in four weight divisions – and offered up yet another reminder that for all Cotto’s accolades boxing doesn’t hand out gold watches.
“I worked hard for it,” said Ali, who won by scores of 116-112, 115-113 and 115-113. “I took advantage of this fight, and I made sure to make it count.”
Ali (26-1, 14 KOs) had been largely outclassed in his lone previous title shot, a ninth-round TKO loss to Jessie Vargas for a vacant welterweight strap last year, leaving many pessimistic about his chances on Saturday against one of the finest champions of his era and the third-biggest star after Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao. Not least the oddsmakers, who installed him as a 6-1 underdog.
But Cotto (41-6, 33 KOs) struggled with Ali’s hand speed, looking every bit of his 37 years as he absorbed a series of big shots in the early rounds, including a right hand to the temple in the second that staggered him and a left hook in the fourth that sent him reeling.
Cotto, fighting in his 10th main event at the hallowed Manhattan ground that’s become his adopted home, rallied back valiantly in the middle rounds, mostly behind an educated jab that kept his opponent tentative. A straight right hand in the sixth rocked Ali and sent the whipped the partisan Puerto Rican crowd into a frenzy. But Cotto’s refusal or inability to stick with the jab proved crucial as Ali’s confidence redoubled as the fight moved into the later stages.
Still, Ali trailed on two judges’ scorecards entering the ninth and was even on the third’s, but he was the busier fighter down the stretch and closed with brio, scoring an upset that will no doubt change the trajectory of his career.
“I had him hurt here or there in the first couple of rounds,” said Ali, who connected with 139 of 647 punches (21%) compared to 163 of 536 (30%) for Cotto. “I knew I had to do something, or he would have dug in. By the 11th, I thought the fight was close.”
Afterward, Cotto acknowledged that he’d injured his left bicep in the seventh round, but refused to attribute his sixth career loss to the injury and reiterated his intent to walk away.
“Feeling good,” Cotto said. “Feeling good with the performance. Something happened to my left bicep, seventh round. I don’t want to make excuses, Sadam won the fight. It is my last fight. I am good and I want to be happy in my home with my family.”
For Ali, who earned $600,000 for Saturday’s work compared to $750,000 for Cotto, it was a career-altering night. What comes next is unclear due to the network alliances that continue to hamstring this once-mainstream sport, but it was the last of the Brooklynite’s concerns in the afterglow of unexpected triumph.
“Whatever [Golden Boy Promotions] has next, I’ll take it,” Ali said. “Good things happen to good people. I have been training since I was eight years old, and I am glad I got this win at MSG in my hometown.”


Cameron Smith has won the Australian PGA Championship in a tense play-off over two extra holes against Jordan Zunic.
The pair were locked at under 18 through 72 holes at Royal Pines, with Smith missing a two-metre putt on the last that would have given him a five-under round and clinched the title.
Both men parred the first extra hole, before a superb up and down from Smith gave him the advantage the second time they played the 18th on Sunday. Zunic’s three-metre par putt lipped out, leaving Smith a putt from inside two metres for the Joe Kirkwood Cup.
It was a frustrating end to a superb four days for Zunic, who missed the two-year European Tour exemption that comes with the winner’s cheque of nearly $240,000.
Queenslander Smith, who won on the US PGA Tour this year, overcame drama when a heckler was removed from the course. The man had been continually disrupting Smith on the closing holes, forcing the world No86 to walk away from his approach to the 18th in regulation play.
He bogeyed that hole, which forced the third play-off in the last four years on the Gold Coast, but remained composed to win his first Australian championship.
The win comes after a fourth place at last week’s Australian Open in Sydney and victory at the Zurich Classic teams event on the rich US PGA tour in May alongside Swede Jonas Blixt.
South Australian Adam Bland made a late charge to finish one shot off the pace, while Marc Leishman birdied four of five holes at one stage to finish tied fourth at 14 under.
It was a back and forth between Zunic and Smith for the title on the final day, though, the pair trading shots on the front nine and drawing level on the 10th after Zunic had started with a three-shot lead.
Things looked dire for 24-year-old Smith on the eighth when he found water with his tee shot. A pinpoint approach hit the flag stick and left Smith with a sloping 10-metre putt for par. But Smith drained it to stay in touch and walk off the green with a wry smile and shrug of the shoulders, before collecting birdies on the next two holes to grab a share of the lead.


Ben Stokes endured a torrid time with bat and ball as he suffered defeat on his Canterbury debut against Otago in New Zealand’s 50-over Ford Trophy.
The 26-year-old flew to New Zealand, the place of his birth, earlier in the week and signed as an overseas player for Canterbury on Thursday, but was dismissed for two and then failed to take a wicket in his nine overs as Otago claimed a three-wicket win.
Otago won the toss and elected to bowl in Rangiora and Stokes was brought to the crease earlier than anticipated as Canterbury fell to five for two inside three overs. However, his innings only lasted seven balls as he played on to 33-year-old left-arm spinner Anaru Kitchen to leave his new side struggling on 10 for three.
It was Stokes’s first innings since 24 September. That was the day he made 73 in an ODI against West Indies, before becoming involved in an altercation outside a nightclub in Bristol early the next morning. Stokes and Alex Hales were both suspended by the ECB pending a police investigation, effectively making them unavailable for the Ashes.
Stokes was granted permission by the ECB to play in New Zealand even though he remains under suspension. Avon and Somerset police passed his file to the Crown Prosecution Service last week, reducing the player’s chances of being cleared to play any part in England’s ongoing Ashes series in Australia.
Canterbury eventually reached 221 for nine in their 50 overs, with Stokes then opening the bowling, a four-over spell producing 26 runs. He was brought back for a second four-over stint in the 19th and while he conceded just 15 runs, Rob Nicol managed to hit for six.
A clatter of wickets saw Otago collapse from 175 without loss to 198 for seven, but Stokes ended with figures of nought for 49 off nine overs.


It was the 10-hole setback lurking in the dark recesses of Tiger Woods’s mind. It was an intervention from reality as fairytale threatened to take over. A grim Saturday spell at the Hero World Challenge illustrated that fevered anticipation – as linked to next year’s Masters betting, for example – surrounding Woods remains heavily offset by facts.
It would be unfair to focus on such troubles without highlighting the admirable response that followed it. Woods toiled badly in reaching the 11th tee at five-over par for his third round. In the most testing winds of the event, the 14-times major champion had dropped a shot at the 1st and hopelessly grasped for confidence boosts thereafter.
Woods’s approach play was loose, his chipping a liability and the driving, which had been such a strength over the first two days, suddenly suspect. Having saved par impressively at the 11th, he had hit only two greens in regulation. Gone were the smiles; Woods was desperately trying to summon the spirit which once underpinned his greatness.
Salvation followed. Woods removed his cap and took a bow in an impressive act of self-deprecation having holed out for a birdie at the 14th. He collected another shot on the penultimate hole, meaning a 75 which in context of broader scoring was not disastrous. Only five of the 18-man field broke par for their third rounds. Woods outscored the world No1 Dustin Johnson by one and Henrik Stenson, the 2016 Open champion, by a stroke more.
“Overall I’m very happy with what’s going on this week,” Woods insisted. “There were a lot of questions that I had, I’m sure you guys have had, and I feel like I’ve come out on a good side this week.”
That he retrieved it from an ominous – and familiar – position means an element of praise is indeed due. There is, however, no question that this Woods comeback will not be without bumps in the road. He suggested he may even relish the battle.
“It was a rough start,” Woods added. “Whatever I did right ended up in a bad spot and whatever I did wrong was really wrong.
“I just couldn’t get it turned around, it kept going the wrong way. I hit that shot at the 3rd, which was 278 to the hole, I flew it about 290 into the wind with a cut. I didn’t know I had that shot and ended up against the collar, which is a bad spot and made bogey there. Same thing at the 7th, I carried it too far. I was trying to hit it 300 or so and I carried it about 320 and ended up in a bad spot that I had no shot.
“That’s just golf, we’re always going to face adversity. I was trying to get back to even par for the day, that was my goal. I finished three short of my goal but I was headed in the right direction.”
Now 10 shots away from the lead held by Charley Hoffman, Woods will not win on his return. He can, though, make strides in the fourth round which would point towards a positive outlook for the new year. “I feel good,” Woods added. “I feel like I’ve got some experience in. It’s nice to be part of the fight again. Fighting against the golf course, fighting against the guys, that’s fun. I just haven’t done it a whole lot in the last few years.
“I’m very happy to have hit the ball as well as I have. I’m very happy with the feel of my putter, overall shaping of shots and putting together rounds. I haven’t had a scorecard in my hand for a while; out here is very different to playing at home.”
Hoffman’s 70 means he has a five-shot lead over Justin Rose and Jordan Spieth. Francesco Molinari shot 71 for fourth while Tommy Fleetwood’s 74 slid him back to minus seven and a share of fifth, with the European No1 left to rue finding water on the 18th.


José Mourinho claimed that Paul Pogba had not set out to hurt Héctor Bellerín in the flashpoint that led to a straight red card for the Manchester United midfielder in his team’s 3-1 win at Arsenal.
The manager could sing the praises of David de Gea, who made 14 saves to equal a Premier League record – some of them of the jaw-dropping variety – but the Pogba sending-off on 74 minutes left a bitter taste.
The Frenchman had been excellent but the referee, Andre Marriner, had no option but to dismiss him for a lunge that finished with his studs in the back of Bellerín’s leg.
Mourinho said that Pogba was unhappy at the reaction of the Arsenal captain and his France team-mate, Laurent Koscielny, in the aftermath of the tackle. Pogba’s suspension will see him miss next Sunday’s Manchester derby against City at Old Trafford.
“I didn’t see the red card [incident],” Mourinho said. “I was not even looking in that direction. No television yet for me. I just know that Paul is frustrated and a bit disappointed with this colleague, Koscielny, with this kind of reaction. He is very frustrated because everybody knows that Paul is a clean player and it was not his intention, not at all, to be close to a red card.”
It was a pulsating contest, with United racing into an early two-goal lead, thanks, in part, to Arsenal defensive lapses. The home team came back and, time and again, they were denied by De Gea. After Alexandre Lacazette had made it 2-1 early in the second half, De Gea produced an incredible double save to keep out Lacazette and Alexis Sánchez. Jesse Lingard promptly made it 3-1 on the counter-attack.
“I told [De Gea] after the match that what I saw today was the best goalkeeper in the world,” Mourinho said. “You need the keeper to be there for you. De Gea has made amazing saves but I think [the Arsenal goalkeeper] Petr Cech had an amazing save from Lingard, too. It was two of the best goalkeepers in the world on the pitch. Petr has a great history in the Premier League and David will make a similar impact.”
The Pogba red card was not the only controversy. Arsenal were denied two late penalties by Marriner for challenges by the United substitute Matteo Darmian and Chris Smalling on another substitute, Danny Welbeck, and Lacazette, respectively.
Mourinho suggested that the Arsenal players had been guilty of diving while he also raged at Marriner’s decision to show only a yellow card to Koscielny rather than a red for a last-man foul on Romelu Lukaku at the very end.
“I know the pitch is amazing and maybe that breeds a desire to go to the floor – if it was hard, no; if it was mud, no – but the pitch is absolutely beautiful,” Mourinho said. “I think they were a bit too much.
“I also don’t want to forget my congratulations to both medical departments. My medical department managed to recover [Nemanja] Matic from a ‘maybe’ to a ‘yes’ [after an injury] but the Arsenal medical department managed to recover a player [Lacazette] from a ‘no’ to a complete 90 minutes. Amazing. I congratulate them.”
De Gea told BT Sport : “It’s a win. The team defended well for 90 minutes. It was a good game against Arsenal, we scored three goals but then lost control. It was difficult.”
Arsène Wenger said that he was upset about the referee not awarding any penalties to his Arsenal side. “I have to watch them again but I thought they were [penalties]. I hope at Old Trafford it will be the same. Last night, I watched Napoli vs Juventus on TV and we watched a top-class referee [Daniele Orsato]. If you want to analyse well, watch the difference between them and us and then you will see.”
Wenger added: “When you have 33 shots in a game of this stature as we did, it means our dominance was top-class but I’m angry and disappointed as we have nothing to show for it.
“We have produced an excellent performance but we have conceded three goals. We didn’t start well at the back at all and, even at 2-1, we made another mistake at the back. We had at least 10 chances and we were not efficient enough in the box. That is the reality.”
The win puts United five points behind Premier League leaders Manchester City ahead of their game with West Ham on Sunday.


If anything about last month’s friendlies against Germany and Brazil set a resounding tone for Gareth Southgate it was the way in which, deprived of meaningful possession in the latter, his makeshift side weathered a storm. Few World Cup contenders travel far into the tournament without getting through choppy waters at some point: the task now, particularly with Belgium such an imposing rival for Group G supremacy next summer, is to ensure England are conditioned to master such punishing circumstances when it counts.
Shared hardship is one of Southgate’s pet themes although, giving his 19th and final interview of Friday night in a remote corner of Moscow’s vast Crowne Plaza hotel, he could have been excused for projecting. The issue is serious though and so was Southgate when, albeit with a laugh, he compared that examination by Neymar and company to the rigours of a visit to the Royal Marines’ commando training centre that his squad undertook in June.
“We had that in the last half-hour against Brazil as well, which is the most invaluable hardship you can go through,” Southgate said. “You’re on the pitch and you’re digging in for each other, getting that relief of keeping a clean sheet against arguably the best team in the world at the moment.”
Southgate’s reign has been notable for his concern that the squad shares its burden of expectation. He wants to create a team of leaders and the most visible evidence has been in his choice of six captains – Eric Dier, Harry Kane, Jordan Henderson, Joe Hart, Gary Cahill and Wayne Rooney – across 14 games. The odds on a sole totemic, chest-thumping leader beating the path to Russia appear slim when you take into account his current thinking: the strong implication is that the system is here to stay and has had deeper benefits than a simple directive as to who points and shouts.
“I feel the process has been really revealing for us as a group of staff to watch, but also a good experience for the players to feel that responsibility and to share the ownership,” he said. “Too much has fallen on, in particular, Wayne’s shoulders in the last few years. Now there’s the opportunity, even in meetings and on the training pitch, for others to step forward, make contributions and give an opinion.”
In those circumstances the captaincy becomes more or less a ceremonial honour and Southgate said he would not be averse to following the Spanish model – also used by, among others, Italy – of awarding it to the most-capped player in a given team selection. “There have been times where having one leader is important,” he said. “But I feel as if the modern world is a little bit different and the shared responsibility becomes a more important thing.”
It is hardly an overnight process but those with added reason to mark England’s development feel there has already been a sea change from the night, 17 months ago, when little more than an early Icelandic squall brought them to their knees. The Tunisia coach, Nabil Maâloul, is tasked with plotting a similar upset and was not simply paying lip service when requested to rate their chances shortly after Friday’s draw. Maâloul works as a Premier League pundit and suggested England are not the same team that floundered last year.
“You feel there is one team,” he said. “There is a coach who has got them very tactically disciplined; the England mentality has completely changed.”
It would be wise not to get carried away until Southgate, for whom failure in a walk-through of a qualifying group was not an option, has cajoled England through a somewhat riskier environment. The squad’s relative lack of international knowhow is highlighted by the fact that, if Southgate abided strictly to Spain’s approach, the 22-year-old Raheem Sterling would be skipper-in-waiting in the not implausible event that none of Hart, Cahill or Henderson were on the pitch. Realistically, there is scant prospect of Sterling leading England out next summer but, in hitting scintillating form for Manchester City after a patchy previous year, he has made the kind of strides that serve as a perfect example for his manager to invoke.
“Certainly Raheem has real resilience,” Southgate said. “He is still a young player so there are moments where you have these leaps in improvement and that is huge credit to him and his mentality.”
Sterling is yet to hit similar heights for England and was substituted at half-time in the victory over Malta in September. Southgate has six months to extract a similar level of performance and is working to create an atmosphere where the mental lethargy that has pock-marked so much of England’s recent work is cast aside. He intends to plan another of those exacting awayday activities similar, although not identical, to that experience with the Marines and thinks his players require experiences that will “stimulate them, keep the energy up and the enthusiasm”.
The kind of hardiness that would give Southgate and England a fighting chance in June cannot be microwaved and, with the Football Association only recently having appointed a new head of people and team development in Pippa Grange it is unlikely that major changes to the backroom structure will be foisted upon the players travelling to Russia. Most of the psychological support will come from those already in situ; the hope is that England will translate the good feeling Southgate has nurtured into something even more satisfying. In the meantime, a little more adversity might just come in handy before the biggest challenges come around.


The news came via a press release from Burnley’s media department. “Burnley FC Tops FA Respect Table,” was the headline, announcing the award of a £20,000 prize for having the best record in the top division last season when it came to fair play and understanding, under the guidance of Sean Dyche, that influencing or deceiving the referee should not be thought of as just another skill or tactic.
Nobody should be surprised when Dyche’s ethos is that his players give everything, tackle hard and never shirk a challenge, but also that they do things the right way. Dyche does not tolerate diving. He does not like his players back-chatting with referees – a legacy, undoubtedly, of Brian Clough being his mentor as a young professional at Nottingham Forest – and his own conduct is a significant reason why Burnley have come out on top in a points system that takes into account more than just red and yellow cards.
If it had been purely about disciplinary statistics, Liverpool would have finished top and another four clubs – Swansea City, Bournemouth, Tottenham Hotspur and Southampton – would have been above the team from Turf Moor. Yet Burnley beat them all on the basis that points are lost for disputing decisions, badgering officials and other examples of broken-down professionalism. The managers and their coaching staff are also assessed in every game. The FA has awarded the prize money to the Burnley FC in the Community programme and the people running the club are entitled to feel pleased with themselves.
“I am delighted that we have been named as the Premier League ‘Respect’ award winners for last season,” the chairman, Mike Garlick, said. “This backs up our community ethos off the pitch while, on it, the award is gauged on a points basis, with criteria such as respect to match officials, opposing players and our disciplinary record. This is the third time in four seasons we have won such an award.”
The strange part, however, is that we may never see a full version of the fair‑play table. Plenty of us would like to know who else adhered to the Respect campaign and, likewise, who didn’t. Yet the FA is refusing to share it. In fact, the relevant people at FA headquarters give the impression they are guarding it with their lives – and, if that seems strange, it becomes even more unsatisfactory to learn this is to protect the clubs with the worst records.
I know all this because on Friday I asked the FA where I might locate this league table for an article I was writing about Burnley. The initial response was that it would be forwarded to me, no problem, but then it went silent. Instead, several hours later a statement from the FA’s media department was emailed to declare, four days after the announcement from Turf Moor, that Burnley had won the 2016-17 award – but with no table. To a follow-up call, I was told there was never an actual fair‑play table in place and it was no longer decided through a ranking system, which was perplexing, to say the least, when Burnley had just won £20,000 for finishing top of this nonexistent league.
Some more calls ensued and, finally, after a rather painful day of going back and forth, the FA came back to say further inquiries had revealed the fair-play league (the one it had claimed never existed) could not be shared because of a policy to protect the worst offenders from negative publicity or difficult questions – and stop the focus being on the clubs who had been outed for poor behaviour.
Protect them? Nobody is asking for the relevant managers to be put in stocks and publicly humiliated but it seems extraordinarily weak that the organisation in charge of the Respect campaign is so cowed by the clubs it feels unable to reveal how the clubs ranked.
Would it not be more effective in the long run if the FA actually published the table to identify the clubs who devoted the most time to arguing about refereeing decisions and trying to influence the match officials? Might it not persuade those clubs that something ought to change? Why protect the people who have, in short, not done enough to support the campaign? And here’s an idea: why not bring in a fines system for the clubs who finish in the bottom three? Publicise it – let the clubs explain for themselves, the grown-up way.
The answer to all these questions, I strongly suspect, is that the FA is frightened of taking on the relevant clubs and some of the people it would involve. Liverpool, for example, had 54 yellow cards last season, compared with Burnley’s 64, to record the best disciplinary statistics in the Premier League. Jürgen Klopp’s team also went through the entire league season without a single sending-off, whereas Ashley Barnes and Jeff Hendrick were both dismissed for Burnley. So how did Liverpool not take the prize when they were so far ahead in disciplinary points? Might it be something to do with the way Klopp behaves in the dugout and the tirades he occasionally unleashes on the fourth official? Did the Anfield club lose points because of Klopp himself?
Ironically, I do have a copy of the Premier League’s fair-play table from the 2014‑15 season when there was a category, “positive play”, to encompass diving and time-wasting and various other parts of the game the authorities want to eradicate. That table is particularly revealing because of what it says about the champions, Chelsea, in José Mourinho’s second stint of management at Stamford Bridge. Chelsea were bottom of the players’ respect-to-referees column and only marginally better, one place up, in the category that assessed the behaviour of the managers and backroom staff, judging everything from how they behaved in the technical areas to what they said in press conferences.
The only manager to be deducted more points than Mourinho was Gus Poyet, then at Sunderland, and the previous season Chelsea had the joint worst record with Southampton and Mauricio Pocchetino, followed by Stoke City and Mark Hughes. Three years on, do the latest figures show more of the same with Mourinho, a repeat offender, with Manchester United? And, if so, why can the FA not be bold enough to say so?
Not just Mourinho, either. United were 15th out of 20 clubs in disciplinary terms last season with 77 yellows and two reds, far removed from the days when Sir Alex Ferguson liked to boast the club always came out well in the fair-play charts. Yet Manchester City (71 yellows, four reds) were another two places down, above only West Ham, Hull City and Watford, and Pochettino, again, might not have done brilliantly, either. Spurs, like Liverpool, also had better disciplinary statistics than Burnley in terms of bookings and red cards – yet ended up behind them once the other marks were deducted.
Unfortunately we will probably never know the exact positions, and why, and that is the way the FA wants to keep it. Indeed, when I asked whether it would be possible to see the areas in which Dyche had excelled it was explained that would not be possible, either. The FA, no kidding, did not want to run the possibility of getting complaints from the clubs who had not scored so impressively. Kudos to Burnley for their latest achievement but if the FA really wants teams to improve their behaviour, on and off the pitch, perhaps it should use its own buzzword, stop covering up for the guilty clubs and respect everyone enough to share the truth.
It was sad to see Mark E Smith had to pull out of two concerts last week because of his deteriorating health, leading to an announcement from his bandmates, just before they were due to go on stage in Bristol, that he was too unwell even to leave the hotel.
Every record collection should contain at least one album from the Fall and, as well as all that wonderful Salfordian belligerence he has shown over the years, I always had extra respect for Smith because of the way he used to go to football at a time when the music industry used to look down its nose at the sport – back in the days, to quote the man himself, when Manchester City felt like a commune for “30,000 miserable gets”.
Someone at the BBC obviously has good taste judging by the fact an instrumental version of Theme from Sparta FC became the backdrop for Final Score. Smith was even invited to read out the classified results one Saturday in 2005, his Broughton accent certainly striking a different tone to that of James Alexander Gordon as he let the nation know Manchester United had won at Charlton and City had managed a goalless draw at home to Blackburn Rovers. “Hopeless, as usual.”
His band has been going for more than 40 years now and you have to admire a lyricist who can shoehorn in references to George Best, “Marble Millichip” (Bert, presumably) and a fictional sports reporter by the name of Pat McGatt, as Smith did in Kicker Conspiracy in the early 1980s.
“You couldn’t mention football in the rock world then,” Smith recalled in an interview with When Saturday Comes some years later. “We were on Rough Trade and I told them: ‘This is about football violence.’ It was all: ‘You don’t go to football, do you?’ I remember Melody Maker saying: ‘Mark Smith’s obviously got writer’s block having to write about football.’ About five years later, the same guy reviewed something else saying it was a load of rubbish and ‘nowhere near the heights of Kicker Conspiracy’. And now, of course, all the old music hacks are sat in the directors’ box with Oasis.”
There is one way, in theory, to test the idea that José Mourinho would have been treated differently to Pep Guardiola if it had been the Manchester United manager marching on to the pitch after the final whistle to applaud, berate, manhandle and – if you have read some of the hysteria over the last few days – very nearly kidnap an opposition player.
It would certainly be fun to see the response if Manchester City are beaten at Old Trafford next Sunday and Mourinho felt it necessary to pick out a player in blue – Raheem Sterling, say – to tell him how gifted he was, then start prodding and haranguing him for not doing better on the day.
Alternatively, what if an opposition player were to appear in Guardiola’s face after a last-minute defeat for City, pronounce his admiration for the manager and then start all that other funny business, waving his arms about like a man fighting off a swarm of invisible bees? Something tells me Pep’s sympathisers might not be so understanding as they have been over the last few days.
Let’s not go overboard, though. At least Guardiola has accepted he broke a form of managerial etiquette and that he regrets all that silliness with Nathan Redmond after the game against Southampton. It was odd, to say the least, but so is the FA’s request for an explanation when both Guardiola and Redmond have already offered one. What is the governing body actually considering here? A charge of misconduct for flattery?


Sergio Ramos may have won the Champions League twice, three La Liga titles, the World Cup and two European Championships but once again the defender is in the headlines for the wrong reasons. On Sunday night, the 31-year-old was sent off for the 22nd time in his Real Madrid career for a lunge on Lionel Messi. It ended a run of a full calendar year without a red card for the combustible character. Delve into Ramos’s back catalogue here:
Two yellow cards in the 61st and 87th minutes was an appropriate beginning to Ramos’s red card journey when he was sent off at the Olympic Stadium in Barcelona. It began a habit of obtaining double yellows rather than straight reds and his consequent suspension paved the way for a notable debut: step forward Jonathan Woodgate.
Just 10 days later, Ramos received the second red of his Madrid career when he was dismissed for a clash with the Olympiakos substitute Giannakis Okkas, reacting angrily to a late challenge by the Cypriot in the 91st minute. The sending-off came only minutes after a young Roberto Soldado had spared Madrid’s blushes with a late winner.
Madrid needed two goals within the last five minutes to salvage a draw at the Anoeta after Ramos had earlier been sent off in a game where both sides were reduced to 10 men.
Zinedine Zidane’s final game was marred by a straight red card for Ramos after a handball in his own box. Diego Forlán duly converted the penally before Julio Baptista scored a late equaliser for Madrid.
Ramos was sent off for the first time in a Madrid derby as two customary fouls earned him his two customary bookings. It seemed the experience of his fellow defenders Roberto Carlos and Fabio Cannavaro was having little impact on the young Spaniard.
Two silly tackles resulted in two yellow cards for Ramos five minutes either side of half-time. The loss relegated Madrid to third in the table, with Sevilla overtaking them.
In a hugely ill-tempered match that saw three red cards, Ramos was sent off in the 55th-minute after an elbow on the former Liverpool striker Florent Sinama-Pongolle. He had been booked following a rash double-footed challenge just five minutes earlier.
The Spaniard earned his second red card in little over two months as he was booked twice once again before receiving his marching orders. A 46th-minute handball was followed 20 minutes later by a deliberate trip. Despite dropping two points, Madrid remained top and would go on to win La Liga that season.
Ramos received a straight red for a blatant step on the chest of Eliseu while the Portuguese defender was on the ground.
The Spaniard was sent off for the second time in the Madrid derby, this time earning an instant dismissal following a last-man challenge on Sergio Agüero.
After receiving a booking for throwing the ball away in the first half, he was shown a second yellow for the same time-wasting tactics in second-half injury-time. With the group won, sceptics believed Ramos’ dismissal to have been deliberately earned, in order that he could serve a suspension in the dead-rubber final group game.
A scything tackle on David Villa was met with a yellow card 20 minutes from time before Ramos then hacked down Lionel Messi in injury time. Additional handbags with Carles Puyol and Xavi ensured his first red card in el clásico.
An initial yellow card for protesting a free-kick was followed by another for an elbow on his international team-mate Sergio Busquets. Ramos had earlier had a headed goal disallowed for a foul in the build-up on the night Madrid crashed out of the Copa at the semi-final stage.
On Ramos’s 300th appearance for Madrid, he set a new record for the club as his two yellow cards meant he had been sent off in La Liga more times than any other Madrid player in history. He received his marching orders following an elbow on Nilmar, on a night the manager José Mourinho and Mesut Özil also saw red for Madrid.
After gaining an unneeded booking during a mild altercation with the Celta players, Ramos secured a very deserved second yellow for a challenge which possibly warranted a straight red. As they grappled for the ball, Ramos kicked out as Augusto Fernández, catching him in the chest.
Ramos received two yellow cards, was sent off and scored inside the opening 20 minutes. After doubling Madrid’s lead in the 12th minute, he was booked twice in a 42-second period five minutes later. First he tugged the shirt of Robert Trashorras before committing a deliberate handball.
The Spaniard earned a 26th-minute straight red as the last line of defence following a foul on Umut Bulut. His dismissal meant Ramos has now averaged a red card every 20 games for Madrid.
The first of Ramos’ two yellows, shown for a dissent after he was harshly adjudged to have fouled Álvaro Cejudo, could be considered unlucky. He could arguably have been shown a straight red card though for his second offence: a forearm swing at the face of his marker. Madrid were 2-0 down at the time of his dismissal but managed to equalise thanks to a late goal from Pepe.
There was not a great deal of contact between Ramos and Neymar after the Barcelona forward cut across the Madrid defender in the 64th minute but the slight clip of the heels had catastrophic results. Neymar tumbled to the floor in the penalty box, Ramos was sent off despite his typically furious remonstrations and Lionel Messi stepped up to draw Barcelona level. Twenty minutes later the Argentinian repeated the trick from the spot to complete his hat-trick and blow the La Liga title race wide open.
After surviving the 2014-15 season without a red card, an apparently reformed Ramos was on his way to making it two seasons in a row before a stoppage-time yellow in Gran Canaria ended that run. Having picked up a yellow card in the first half the Real Madrid captain then crunched through the back of his Las Palmas counterpart, Momo, in the dying moments to seal his 20th career red card.
His first return to action after suspension following the red card at Las Palmas came in El Clásico. After picking up an early booking, Ramos spent the rest of the match apparently chasing another, though it took until the 84th minute for Alejandro Hernández to finally reach to his pocket and and show the second yellow, when Ramos needlessly slid through the back of Luis Suárez. Cristiano Ronaldo’s late winner won Real the points nonetheless and reignited the title race, ending Barcelona’s 39-game unbeaten streak in the process.
Having managed to go a full calendar year without seeing red and with his side trailing 2-1 in a clásico that could help decide the league title, Ramos’s nostrils flared as Lionel Messi picked up the ball towards the touchline. A wild lunge fortunately didn’t fully connect with the Barcelona forward – had it done so he could have been seriously injured – but it still sent him tumbling into the air before thudding into the Bernabéu turf. The referee Alejandro Hernández had no hesitation in directing Ramos towards an early bath. Ten-man Real equalised through James Rodriguez but could not hold on. Messi’s sumptuous injury-time goal sealed a 3-2 win for Barça.
Ramos earned a booking after an angry confrontation with Dépor’s Fabian Schär, who was also cautioned. The centre-back raised his hands to the Swiss defender’s face after 53 minutes, and was fortunate not to receive a straight red. With the game won, Ramos picked up a second yellow card in stoppage time after using his elbow in an aerial challenge with Deportivo’s Borja Valle.
After missing three matches with a broken nose, Ramos returned to the Real Madrid line-up against Athletic Bilbao wearing a face mask – and was promptly sent off for two separate incidents where he raised an arm to an opponent. Booked in the 11th minute for landing a forearm on Raul García, he followed it up by catching Artiz Aduriz with his arm three minutes from time. Ramos is now La Liga’s all-time record holder for red cards after picking up his 19th league dismissal.


It was an occasion when Manchester United demonstrated a remorseless edge in front of goal and yet could count the goalkeeper, David de Gea, as their most influential player. And it was one in which the joy of a first Premier League away win over a big six rival under José Mourinho was undercut by a senseless red card for Paul Pogba.
What a mixed bag it was for the France midfielder. He had set up Antonio Valencia’s opening goal and strutted about the Emirates as though he owned the place. But on 74 minutes he lunged at Héctor Bellerín and planted his studs into the Arsenal defender’s leg. It drew the inevitable censure and the kicker is that Pogba will be suspended for next Sunday’s Manchester derby.
Arsenal played a full part in a richly entertaining spectacle and they will wonder how they emerged with nothing. There were two principle reasons: the re-emergence of their defensive frailties, and De Gea. Arsenal rained 33 shots at the Spaniard’s goal, with 15 of them on target, but their only reward was Alexandre Lacazette’s close-range finish early in the second half to make it 2-1.
At that point, Arsenal looked set fair for the equaliser. But De Gea, who had made a string of excellent first-half saves, kept his best until last. His double stop to keep out Lacazette and Alexis Sánchez drew a sharp intake of breath. He finished with 14 saves, equalling a Premier League record. Is there even a question about his current pre-eminence in English football?
Jesse Lingard promptly added his second and United’s third on the counterattack and it was impossible to ignore the contrast in the attacking statistics. The visitors’ three goals came from four shots on target.
Arsenal had entered on a roll, their confidence pepped by the derby victory over Tottenham Hotspur and a feeling that they had located their groove – particularly on home turf. Theirs was a performance of vim and vigour but no team can offer such presents and expect to emerge unscathed.
The first was gift-wrapped by Laurent Koscielny. His floated cross-field pass for Sead Kolasinac was intercepted by Valencia and he moved it on to Pogba. Everyone in red was drawn to the midfielder – an illustration of the fear factor that has built around him – and, when he popped it back to Valencia, the defender had the time and space to shoot low through Petr Cech’s legs.
United had scored only once in seven previous away games under Mourinho against big six clubs but here they were two up after 11 minutes. This time, Shkodran Mustafi was the Arsenal villain. Receiving possession as the last defender, he dawdled and was robbed by Lingard. The ball broke to Romelu Lukaku, who found Anthony Martial and his wonderful flick ushered in Lingard, who guided a first-time finish inside the far corner.
To add to their problem, Mustafi felt Lingard’s challenge and was forced off. “I don’t know what he has,” Arsène Wenger said waspishly when asked about Mustafi. “I don’t know what is wrong with him at all.”
Wenger sent on Alex Iwobi, switched to 4-2-3-1 and almost immediately the flow of the game changed. It was a minor miracle how Arsenal did not score before the interval but De Gea refused to be beaten. Two of his first-half saves stood out. He managed to smuggle Lacazette’s close-range shot up and on to the crossbar – Granit Xhaka curled the rebound inches wide – while he pawed the ball away from the line after Sánchez’s free-kick had ricocheted off Lukaku.
Arsenal did not get the breaks but the crowd stayed with them and their belief did not drop. Eventually they got their reward when Aaron Ramsey touched back Mesut Özil’s cross and as United stopped and prayed for a flag, Lacazette shot past De Gea. Game on.
The outstanding Lingard hit a post on the break in the 52nd minute but it was Arsenal who looked the likelier scorer of the next goal. De Gea had other ideas. He had saved smartly from Iwobi before he threw out a hand to deny Lacazette and followed up by saving with his feet from Sánchez.
United’s third was another horror show for Arsenal and, once again, Koscielny was implicated. He seemed to have Pogba under control only to be tricked and out-muscled by him on the touchline. Pogba crossed, Lingard tapped in.
Pogba would feel the red mist descend and there was still time for the referee, Andre Marriner, to wave away strong penalty appeals from the Arsenal substitute, Danny Welbeck, and Lacazette. Mourinho raged when Marriner chose only to caution Koscielny rather than dismiss him for a last-man foul on Lukaku. It was the game of the season, so far. When the dust settled, it was United who could smile.


A murky, wintry evening in Coventry but this was a performance to give Wasps supporters a warm feeling as they left the stadium on Saturday night after an epic contest.
Kearnan Myall, the Wasps lock in his distinctive orange scrum cap, battered his way over for the winning try in the last move of the match.
Wasps had recovered from going 10 points down in the early stages and it was rough justice on the Tigers, beaten last week by Worcester in the shock of the Premiership season so far.
Wasps leapfrog over opposition they have now beaten five times in succession and the victory was in no small measure to the efforts of their No8 and the man of the match Nizaam Carr, who recently became the first Muslim to play for the Springboks. Carr is here for three months and Wasps will hope he can stay longer.
Wasps were without their captain, Joe Launchbury, and Tigers were missing Jonny May, both nursing injuries from England’s meeting with Samoa last Saturday. Leicester still had four other England men in their starting lineup, though, and one of them made an early impression. After George Ford had landed an early penalty, the fly-half gained the Tigers an edge with a clever kick to the corner and from a lineout soon afterwards Mike Fitzgerald drove forwards and Tom Youngs crashed over for the first try.
Leicester were in the driving seat but in this fixture the marketing men nowadays call the M69 derby, it was not all one-way traffic. James Gaskell, the Wasps lock, made a decisive break, Dan Robson made another and the scrum-half gave the pass to Carr who motored over near the posts.
Carr looks a useful addition to a pack hit by injuries and he joined another flowing move that ended with the home pack muscling their way forwards and Robson snatching a smart try.
Life got not better for Leicester when Ellis Genge, another of last week’s England contingent, had to leave the field just before the break with an arm injury. After the interval Juan de Jongh escaped 10 minutes in the sin-bin when the centre nudged the ball forwards to halt a Leicester move and Wasps escaped three points when Ford’s penalty attempt struck the woodwork.
Their relief did not last for long and after a period of sustained pressure the Leicester wing Jonah Holmes, once a Wasp, squeezed home for a well-taken try in the corner. Ford could not add the conversion but the Tigers were back to within two points of the home side.
Holmes, making a first start for the Tigers, soon struck again when he intercepted a Willie le Roux pass inside the Leicester half and raced 60m to score his second try. The lead then changed hands again as Wasps moved the ball wide and Daly scored a wonderful try before Ford levelled the scores with a penalty. It was a match neither team deserved to lose.

Sam Allardyce savoured an ideal start to his new job as he made an instant impact as Everton manager with a 2-0 home win against Huddersfield while Alan Pardew, sacked by Crystal Palace last December, said he was encouraged on his return to the hot seat despite West Brom failing to find a way past his former club.
Allardyce became the first man to manage seven clubs in the Premier League and revealed he had turned down a number of other positions before accepting an 18-month contract at Goodison Park. He has set his sights on securing a second successive seventh-place finish for Everton. “If I take a job, it is because I am totally and 100% committed,” he said. “I don’t take the job in any other circumstances. I turned many a job down before this one. I felt this to be right for me. It is a dream job for me.
“It wasn’t a difficult decision. I knew how good it was, with the history of the club and the people I know in and around the club and who have played for this club. So I have got to live up to that standard and make them better if I can and try and get them back to where they were last season as quick as I can.
“I don’t know how long it will take but I will try my very best to have the sort of season they had last year, if not better. Back-to-back wins for the first time this season: let’s hope it is onwards and upwards.”
Allardyce had a slower start in his previous survival mission, when he succeeded Pardew at Palace on a short-term contract last season, and enjoyed an earlier victory this time. “It took me six games at Palace and everyone was telling me I was coming back too soon and I was not the man I used to be,” he said.
Gylfi Sigurdsson and Dominic Calvert-Lewin scored against Huddersfield after Allardyce ordered his wingers to focus on attacking. “We changed our tactics at half-time because we needed to get Gylfi and Aaron [Lennon] further up the pitch,” Allardyce said. “We told them not to chase their full-backs back. That got Gylfi in the box with a lovely flick and finish. I am so pleased for Dominic that he got a goal after his work on the front line.”
Allardyce has already turned his thoughts to the January transfer window, adding: “I know the positions we need.” He also hopes to keep Ross Barkley, who almost joined Chelsea in the summer and is out of contract next summer, but fears the midfielder may have already agreed to join another club. “If we can get Ross Barkley to stay, no one will be happier than me but I don’t know if a deal has already been done,” he said.
Palace’s Julián Speroni made several key saves to deny his former manager victory after being drafted in 25 minutes before kick-off at the Hawthorns when Wayne Hennessey suffered a back spasm in the warm-up.
“I had some really good performances and I can’t fault their application,” Pardew said. “It’s just a shame that we can’t send our fans home happy.
“It was good to feel the camaraderie of the dressing room and they were very focused before the game. We have a lot of experience in there and I’m looking forward to working with them.”
While Palace moved off the bottom, above Swansea and West Ham, West Brom are still without a victory since the second match of the season – a run that now stretches back 13 games. But Pardew saw plenty of reasons to be positive after his first match in charge for almost a year. “I’m buoyed by the commitment that they gave me,” he said. “We sometimes lacked confidence at the right moment but that is something we can improve on.”


What conclusions should be drawn from this bracing encounter between two teams determined to give no quarter? Was it two points dropped for Spurs as their run without a Premier League win extended to four matches? Or was it a point earned, after being forced to play most of the second half with 10 men? For Watford, should they have taken greater advantage of the dismissal of Davinson Sánchez in the 52nd minute? Or had they proven they can go toe to toe with the big teams and compete?
In the end the managers were inclined to take a positive approach. Watford’s Marco Silva was proud of the performance and was aggrieved not have been awarded penalties in two contentious incidents. Meanwhile, his Tottenham counterpart, Mauricio Pochettino, was almost serene, singing the praises of his team for the way they kept attacking and insisting their current run is character forming.
The sending off of Sánchez was biggest moment, the defender dismissed for stopping a Richarlison counter-attack with an arm to the Brazilian’s face. Pochettino was disinclined to express much of an opinion, but suggested the contact was accidental. “I’m not going to complain, I’m not going to say anything,” he said. “Of course we are going to watch it back on video and I’ve had lots of messages on my phone, some are saying he should have been sent off, some say not. I think it was not his intention but maybe the arm touches the face of the player and that is the interpretation of the referee.”
Sánchez’s arm certainly did touch Richarlison face and Silva was in no doubt about the dismissal. His concern was more whether Watford should have had a spot-kick in the dying seconds after Richarlison’s cross rebounded off the arm of Eric Dier.
“The defender stops Richarlison with an arm in his face, that is obvious,” the Watford manager said. “Maybe he wants to put it on another part of the body, but the arm goes into the face. Maybe also Dier didn’t want to put his hand on the ball, but we should have had one penalty.”
When the teams were even in number, Spurs were dominant in possession while Watford menaced on the counter. It was Richarlison who was central to their approach, his pace and control an instant release whenever they were under pressure.
His breakaway run, hugging the chalk of the touchline, earned a corner from which the home side opened the scoring in the 13th minute. Tom Cleverley played Richarlison in and then delivered the corner that was headed home by Christian Kabasele, the Belgian defender eluding his marker, a sleeping Harry Kane.
Spurs equalised 12 minutes later, seconds after Watford had had another loud penalty appeal. Ben Davies appeared to have barged Richarlison off the ball in a goalmouth scramble but as the Watford players threw their hands in the air, Kieran Trippier burst into the space left by the Brazilian. The full-back slipped a pass through to Christian Eriksen, the Dane darted to the touchline and then provided the perfect pull-back for Son Heung-min, who turned the ball home at the back post from six yards.
Spurs might have scored just before the break with a Davies volley and came out in the second half with an assertiveness that looked set to pay dividends. The dismissal of Sánchez might have changed all that but Pochettino was pleased with the way his team dug in and continued to create opportunities. Trippier was at the heart of things and Moussa Sissoko blazing into the side-netting when put through.
At the other end, Silva had to hold his breath along with the rest of the ground as Abdoulaye Doucouré’s imperious drive from a corner cannoned off the inside of the post and away from goal.
“In the last few games all is against us, but this is a very good experience,” Pochettino said. “It’s important in football to sometimes feel frustration and in the future the team will be stronger.
“We need to know that it’s not always easy. Sometimes a tough period is important because that’s when you build your character.”


Winless in their last six games and with fixtures against Aston Villa, Middlesbrough, Derby and Wolves to come this month, Millwall were in danger of drifting down the table – but ended their barren run against promotion-chasing Sheffield United. Lee Gregory gave Millwall the lead against the run of play, before David Brooks’ spectacular finish made it 1-1 at half-time. Defender Mahlon Romeo and Jake Cooper scored in the second half to seal a surprise win, and leave Chris Wilder’s side six points behind second-placed Cardiff, who beat Norwich on Friday.
Bristol City climbed to third in the table on goal difference after a 2-1 win over Middlesbrough in the late kick-off. Joe Bryan opened the scoring for Lee Johnson’s side, who had a suitably festive gif ready for the occasion. Jamie Paterson volleyed the second moments later, and the hosts held on despite Hordur Magnusson’s own goal. City go to Bramall Lane next Friday as both sides seek to catch the top two.
Ipswich Town prevailed in a six-goal thriller between two play-off chasing sides at Portman Road. The hosts twice took the lead in the first half but Nottingham Forest bounced back with well-taken goals from Kieran Dowell and Tyler Walker. Mick McCarthy’s side proved too strong after the break, Martyn Waghorn’s 10th goal of the season and a Bersant Celina strike sealing a 4-2 win. Derby County also boosted their promotion hopes with a hard-fought win over local rivals Burton. The visitors held on but Johnny Russell’s 81st-minute winner leaves the Brewers bottom.
Burton replace Bolton Wanderers, who climbed out of the bottom three with a 3-1 home win over Barnsley. Gary Madine converted Mark Little’s cross to put the hosts ahead, before the sides exchanged penalties, Madine restoring Bolton’s lead after Tom Bradshaw’s spot kick. Little added a third from the edge of the area with 20 minutes to go. Hull City earned a valuable point – and eased the pressure on manager Leonid Slutsky – after Michael Dawson poked home a stoppage-time equaliser at Sheffield Wednesday.
Hull were one of only two sides to get a result on the road in Saturday’s 3pm games – no prizes for guessing the other, as Reading extended Sunderland’s winless run at home in Chris Coleman’s first game in charge. QPR are edging towards the drop zone after a 1-0 defeat at Preston. The visitors held on for more than an hour after Jamie Mackie’s red card, but Jordan Hughill struck with two minutes to go. Alex Baptiste was sent off for QPR in stoppage time as Ian Holloway’s side finished with nine men.
Finally, one statistical study this week showed Brentford may be better than their mid-table position. Dean Smith’s team made a start on putting that right against West London rivals Fulham. Sergi Canos and Romaine Sawyers put the hosts in front after Neeskens Kebano’s opener, before Denis Odoi was dismissed for Fulham. Ollie Watkins struck with five minutes to go to make sure of the win.
Results: Bolton Wanderers 3-1 Barnsley, Brentford 3-1 Fulham, Derby County 1-0 Burton Albion, Ipswich Town 4-2 Nottingham Forest, Millwall 3-1 Sheffield United, Preston North End 1-0 QPR, Sheffield Wednesday 2-2 Hull City, Sunderland 1-3 Reading.
Just three years after rising from the ashes of Hereford United, seventh-tier Hereford FC are in the hat for Monday’s third round draw after a 1-1 draw with Fleetwood. The Bulls’ previous incarnation had plenty of FA Cup history, and Calvin Disley continued that tradition by putting the visitors ahead in Lancashire. Devante Cole levelled soon after but the non-league team held on to earn a replay.
Two other prospective giant-killers gave league teams a fright before falling short. In the lunchtime game, Oxford City twice equalised against League Two high-flyers Notts County, but were denied by Jorge Grant’s last-gasp winner. National League side Maidstone United took a half-time lead at MK Dons through Magnus Okuonghae, but faded in the second half to lose 4-1.
Elsewhere, Forest Green turned a 2-1 deficit in the 88th minute into a 3-2 lead, but were pegged back by Jayden Stockley’s 94th-minute goal as Exeter forced a replay. Shrewsbury put their stuttering promotion bid on hold to progress, beating Morecambe 2-0, and Danny Newton’s double helped Stevenage thrash Swindon 5-2.
Results: Notts County 3-2 Oxford City, Bradford City 3-1 Plymouth Argyle, Fleetwood Town 1-1 Hereford FC, Forest Green Rovers 3-3 Exeter City, Gillingham 1-1 Carlisle United, Milton Keynes Dons 4-1 Maidstone United, Port Vale 1-1 Yeovil Town, Shrewsbury Town 2-0 Morecambe, Stevenage 5-2 Swindon Town.
A quiet day in the lower two tiers on account of FA Cup action, with only two League One matches played, between sides wedged between 12th and 18th in the table at the start of play. Bristol Rovers bounced back from going a goal down to beat Rotherham at the Memorial Stadium, with Ellis Harrison and Liam Sercombe on target for the hosts after Ryan Williams’ opener. Josh Wright was the star of the show for Southend, winning a penalty which Jason Demetriou converted and then volleyed in a second as the Shrimpers climbed to ninth with a win over Oldham.
Results: Bristol Rovers 2-1 Rotherham United, Southend United 2-0 Oldham Athletic.


It is only the beginning of December but already Woking are chasing their second FA Cup shock of the season. Last month the National League side knocked out Bury with a thumping 3-0 win at Gigg Lane. On Sunday they host Peterborough, another League One team. Their goalkeeper Nathan Baxter is not unexcited by the prospect. “It’s an unbelievable opportunity,” the 19-year-old says. “For the players it is an opportunity to test ourselves against league players, good league players, to perhaps get through and draw one of the big boys. For the fans it’s important and financially for the board too. It’s a great competition, it was a great night at Bury, so we’ll be looking for more of the same.”
Baxter is answering questions from a battered leather sofa in the clubhouse at Woking’s training ground. The premises are shared with local Surrey side Bisley and the site is an odd mixture of old- and new-school football. On the outside it is a muddy pitch and two black wooden shacks. On the inside there are ranks of top-of-the-range exercise bikes and a chef serving a nutritionally balanced meal of burritos. Ninth in the National League at the start of the weekend, Woking are a club on the up. The manager, Anthony Limbrick, has assembled a squad of young, hungry players desperate to make the grade in the Football League and Baxter very much fits in this bracket.
“Pretty much all of us are 21, 22. You’ve got the odd younger one like me and then the odd older one but it’s a really good group of lads and we’re all really hungry to get on,” he says. “Everyone gets on here and I think that’s definitely helped us in the way we’ve been able to hold on to results and come together in the final minutes to get wins.”
When Baxter puts his gloves on against Peterborough he will be making his 57th start as a professional, an impressive total for a teenage keeper. For the past two years he has played at three clubs, first for the Metropolitan Police in the Isthmian League, then Solihull Moors in the National League and now for their rivals Woking. Yet he is also a Chelsea player: a graduate of their academy, he received his football education with the Blues from the age of seven and has been playing on loan. Baxter won the FA Youth Cup in 2015 alongside Tammy Abraham and he has trained and gone on summer tours with the seniors. He is part of the generation nurtured under the Premier League’s elite player performance plan. But to take the next step in his career he has had to drop four tiers down the pyramid.
“For a young goalkeeper the most important thing is game time, playing football and learning,” he says. “Perhaps there’s plenty of examples of outfield players who’ve gone straight into Premier League football but I think it’s less so for a goalkeeper. To learn my trade in the lower leagues is definitely a positive and each game I feel like I improve and become more comfortable. It’s definitely stood me in good stead.
“I feel like when you play National League football the games come so thick and fast; Saturday, Tuesday every week. And the amount the points mean, it’s massive, because people’s livelihoods are on the line. As a goalkeeper I know I need to be on it and last season I went on loan to two teams who were down at the bottom of the table.
“Growing up at Chelsea I’d never known that. Walking on to the pitch, knowing I was going to have loads to do and that I had to play well for us to get three points was a different experience. I feel like I’m more well rounded now; you learn to deal with crosses and the more physical side of the game but you already have the technical upbringing.”
That technical upbringing is the result of a decade at Chelsea’s Cobham training complex. Spotted by a scout at the age of six and training four times a week from the age of eight, Baxter has had the best footballing education possible. He says he enjoyed every minute of it and has apparently sought out as much extra coaching as he could. “I was very lucky in terms of the amount of goalkeeping coaching you get” he says. “At Chelsea the setup is great. Then, as you get older and being able to play out from the back becomes more important, I would maybe do an extra session with the outfield players to try and improve that aspect as much as I could. But really, it’s just about what works best for you.”
Then came the decision to leave. Baxter still lives in his Chelsea digs and is in regular communication with his Cobham coaches, who continue to go through video analysis of his performances with him. If he has a niggle, he can use the club’s physios. But he may never actually play for the club he has been part of for as long as he can remember. Whether he has made the right choice time will tell, and it is a choice many more young players from the elite academies will be forced to make. But in this young man there is both an obvious confidence and a steely resolve to concentrate on only those things he can effect.
“Since the age of seven I’ve dreamed of playing for Chelsea so it’s just trying to get as close as I can to that,” Baxter says. “But you can’t start thinking about what you’re going to do in a couple of months, never mind what you’re going to do next season. My focus is purely on Sunday.”


This may not have been how Alan Pardew would have imagined his return to the dugout, yet on a day that saw both he and opposite number Roy Hodgson face former clubs, a first clean sheet in 10 matches at least gave West Brom’s new manager something to build on.
A frustrating afternoon that saw Albion thwarted on several occasions by the stand-in goalkeeper Julián Speroni ensured that Hodgson emerged the more satisfied, even as Crystal Palace set another unwanted record by becoming the first team to fail to score in 10 successive Premier League away games.
“I’m disappointed we haven’t won,” said Pardew. “We tried to really unhinge them at the start but then we lost our way. I was really pleased with the second half. With a bit more belief around the box we could have won it.”
Having reached the FA Cup final only seven months earlier, the timing of Pardew’s departure from Selhurst Park three days before Christmas 2016 still rankles despite a record that saw them win just one of his final 11 league games to leave them in 17th place. That was exactly the position which West Brom found themselves in at kick off, having accrued fewer points than any other team in the division since the start of the year under Tony Pulis.
Pardew made just one change to the team that surrendered a 2-0 lead against Newcastle in midweek as Jay Rodriguez came in to an attacking 4-3-3 formation. West Brom’s supporters responded with a warm welcome for the manager who had promised to “free up” his new side at his unveiling this week, although apart from the opening 20 minutes and a spell at the start of the second half, the fans would have struggled to notice much difference.
Hal Robson-Kanu should have scored when Kieran Gibbs’ cross fell to him on the edge of the six-yard box, only for the Wales forward to scoop the ball over from close range. Palace, who were reduced to only five substitutes after Wayne Hennessey was injured in the warm-up, had secured their first away point of the season against Brighton on Tuesday but they looked shaky at the back, with Ahmed Hegazi heading wide from a corner.
Given that Palace’s last Premier League away goal came back in April against Liverpool, West Brom’s defenders were rarely troubled in the opening exchanges, although in Wilfried Zaha the visitors possess a match winner of real quality. Ben Foster was lucky to escape when his attempt to dribble around the forward failed and the goalkeeper used an illegal hand to get himself out of trouble. At the other end, Rodriguez breezed past Martin Kelly but could not evade Mamadou Sakho’s block when a goal seemed likely.
Aside from one Hegazi challenge on Zaha that could have resulted in a penalty, Palace had to wait until the dying moments of the first half to create a serious threat on goal, with Christian Benteke denied by Foster’s sharp save. The striker then headed the resulting corner straight at the goalkeeper.
As Pardew acknowledged, the loss of Gareth Barry after just half an hour seemed to have an unsettling effect on West Brom’s midfield but they came out for the second half in determined mood. A block from Joel Ward was required to keep out the impressive Sam Field, before Rodriguez was denied by Speroni after some delightful skill on the edge of the box.
The Argentinian had lost his place to Hennessey having started five league matches this season but showed he is still capable enough by turning away Salomón Rondón’s effort from a tight angle before thwarting Robson-Kanu’s drive. Palace are due to announce ambitious new plans to redevelop Selhurst Park’s main stand on Monday and survival in the top flight will be crucial to ensuring they can proceed. Theylacked ambition as West Brom attempted to find a winner, with Benteke guilty of failing to react quickly enough to decent crosses into the box on more than one occasion.
Rondón almost made them pay when his header went narrowly wide in the dying minutes after good work from substitute James McClean, as Palace held on to claim a point and move off the bottom of the table for the first time under Hodgson.
“I’m not getting carried away but it was a good point,” said Hodgson, who revealed that Palace’s preparations for the game were disrupted when they had to be evacuated from their train to Birmingham on Friday after it broke down before being kept awake at their hotel by a noisy wedding. “It wasn’t the best way to prepare for a match but at least I’ll go home with a smile on my face.”


An old score was settled, after a fashion, when Willie Mullins sent out Total Recall for what will be recorded as the trainer’s first success in the Ladbrokes Trophy, the race that was known for decades as the Hennessy.
Anyone whose racing memory goes back 15 years will be aware that the Irishman has won it before but his Be My Royal, first past the post in 2002, was eventually disqualified over a finding of morphine in his system, the result of contaminated feed.
For all his affability, Mullins is not a man to bend his knee to authority. Outraged by the verdict and insistent that there should be an allowed threshold for morphine, he engaged in a protracted legal battle that ended at the High Court four years later, the judges declining to interfere with the Jockey Club’s ruling.
Time heals many things and Mullins is vastly more successful these days than he was at the time. But as he entered this winner’s enclosure, he was surely full of satisfaction at the prospect of returning home to Carlow with a six-figure sum in English prize money.
“Hopefully we won’t have any problems this time,” was his wry response when Be My Royal was mentioned. The roll of honour will show Total Recall as the first Irish winner since 1980.
Mullins has had a poor record in English handicap chases over the past decade, largely a result of his good horses moving into that grade only after showing all their ability in better contests. Total Recall, however, dropped into his lap over the summer after the retirement of the horse’s former trainer, Sandra Hughes, and it turns out that his official rating was rather lower than he deserves.
A lesser man might have stayed quiet on that point and let everyone assume he was simply a better trainer. Instead, Mullins complimented Hughes for bringing the horse along patiently and suggested that, had she kept going, she might well have won next year’s Irish National with him.
Total Recall might be a top-class performer by the time that race is run on Easter Monday. Mullins wants to give him an entry in the Cheltenham Gold Cup and will decide if the horse should be flying that high after he runs next, possibly in January’s Thyestes Chase at Gowran Park.
The result was a setback for one press room grandee, who called Total Recall the worst-looking horse in the paddock. “If I was on a day’s hunting and they produced that thing for me, I’d turn my nose up,” he said. But he readily conceded that, in long-distance steeplechasing, handsome is as handsome does.
It was only in the final strides that a late thrust up the far rail carried Total Recall past Whisper, who also lost the RSA Chase at the Festival in heartbreaking circumstances as his stablemate Might Bite rallied past him. “He didn’t stop, the other one went faster,” said Whisper’s trainer, Nicky Henderson, which is a supportive thing to say, even if it seems unlikely to be borne out by close analysis.
A winning favourite in their first year of sponsorship ought to have been a bad result for Ladbrokes but the race was not a loser for them, thanks to the money that came for American. He was never travelling after a mistake at the water and was eventually pulled up.
Coneygree, the 2015 Gold Cup winner, continues to perform a long way below his best, being pulled up at the top of the straight. He was reported to have made a noise and a breathing operation now seems likely. He had helped force a strong pace for more than a circuit and it seems significant that other front-runners – Cogry, Double Ross and Southfield Royale – were also pulled up. Even the second wave of pacesetters, Potters Legend and Missed Approach, tired well before the finish.
Henderson might have been better off at Newcastle, where his Buveur D’Air was hardly out of a canter to win the Fighting Fifth Hurdle. An hour later, the trainer’s Beware The Bear took the Rehearsal Chase, with Sean Bowen doing wonders to stay aboard as his saddle slipped towards the horse’s tail.
The up-and-coming Bryony Frost resumed her run of Saturday successes with an accomplished performance on Old Guard at Newbury. It was fascinating to see Paul Nicholls giving her four rides on such a high-profile card and she was arguably unlucky not to have a second success on Warrior’s Tale, whose chance was not improved by the attentions of a loose horse on the run-in.
“She’s ridden those two chases brilliantly today,” Nicholls said. “She rides well, she uses her head, she’s so tactically aware. As well as being in the right place, she knows what’s going to happen in a race. She’s got a lot of talent and you can see why we’re using her.”
Frost is one of a strong team of jockeys at the Ditcheat stable, taking advantage of the absence through injury of Sam Twiston-Davies. Nicholls expects him to be out for another couple of weeks and predicted that Frost would have chances at Chepstow next Saturday, while Harry Cobden would ride for him at Sandown and Bowen at Aintree.
The trainer ascribed this victory to a wind operation Old Guard had in the summer. “That’s why I do such a lot and why it’s such a success and why I’m never afraid to say that it’s been done,” Nicholls continued, addressing a subject of recent controversy. “The transformation in a horse like him has been phenomenal.
“For all those people that are negative about it, there are good positives about a breathing op and it’s not a problem to let people know it’s been done. Doesn’t make any difference to me or anybody. That all wants putting to bed. It’s a positive for a lot of horses.”

Chris Coleman stood utterly still in the technical area, with hands deep in pockets and shock etched across his face. Barely an hour had passed but, already, he was surrounded by banks of fast-emptying red seats and his first home match as Sunderland’s manager felt destined for inexorable defeat.
Perhaps buoyed by last weekend’s win at Burton Albion, the former Wales manager had breezily declared there was “nothing to be scared of” as his new charges attempted to win their first game for almost a year at the Stadium of Light, but he was soon stripped of such naivety.
Sunderland have now failed to record a home victory in 21 attempts since beating Watford here on 17 December last year and, well before the final whistle, Coleman had cottoned on to brutal Wearside realities. His body language certainly suggested he now truly appreciates the scale of the challenge he faces in preventing a team reduced to 10 men here after Callum McManaman’s sending off from tumbling into League One.
Along the way, Jaap Stam’s Reading all but banished their own relegation worries while simultaneously reinforcing their manager’s recently rather shaky job security by extending a mini revival and climbing deeper into the relative sunlit uplands of mid-table.
Sunderland are now second bottom and it was more than an hour after the final whistle when Coleman emerged from the dressing room. “We’ve had a little chat,” he said. “It’s a huge disappointment, a big blow. You can see the frustration here; every game that goes by without us getting three points is another door closed.”
Only three hours earlier, he had strode, smiling, out of the tunnel as optimists in the stands made bold predictions of a “new dawn”. Fears that it could be doomed to start on a false note began solidifying when Lee Cattermole was extremely fortunate not to be sent off for a second bookable offence. Featuring two needless fouls on Sone Aluko in as many minutes, that little cameo resulted in Cattermole receiving a yellow card for the first challenge before benefiting from subsequent refereeing leniency on Keith Stroud’s part.
McManaman was afforded no such generosity on the brink of half-time. Instead, the winger was sent off for a second bookable offence after blatantly using an arm to divert Adam Matthews’s floated cross beyond Vito Mannone, simultaneously reducing Coleman’s blueprint to tatters.
“I’m a little bit disappointed with Callum,” said Coleman. “It was a killer blow.” Matthews’s delivery had crept under the crossbar and might have gone in anyway. Not that Sunderland really deserved to be ahead at the end of a half in which they had retained possession quite well but lacked imaginative movement and attacking incision.
Although Stam’s side initially offered similarly limited threat, they would have taken the lead had David Edwards not miscued his shot and sent the ball ballooning over the bar from eight yards out when it seemed easier to score.
Edwards’s redemption arrived in the 53rd minute when, concluding a well-worked Reading counterattack, a swipe of his right foot beat Robbin Ruiter from six yards out, after Aluko’s initial shot had been blocked.
His goal was met by an amalgam of anger and defiance, with some locals subjecting Coleman’s players to a barrage of loud boos and others aiming to offer inspiration – or maybe console themselves – courtesy of rousing renditions of “Sunderland ‘til I die”.
Yet, as Stam’s players extended their lead, an eerie silence descended on the ground and a steady stream of supporters poured towards the exits. When Modou Barrow met Liam Kelly’s cross and sent a left-foot volley arrowing into the bottom corner, it was as if a switch had been flicked and any remaining vestige of home optimism extinguished.
Once an unmarked Barrow had again used that left foot to register his side’s third from close range, the latest Wearside inquest was already well under way.
Sunderland regained a sliver of pride when Leandro Bacuna felled substitute Joel Asoro – who contributed some extremely promising touches – and Lewis Grabban converted the resultant penalty, but, as Coleman acknowledged, the atmosphere had long since turned horribly flat.
“Something’s got to break for us,” he said. “And it’s got to break quickly.”


Different coloured ball, same old nonsense. The 2017-18 Ashes may have witnessed less than a week of cricket but when it comes to behaviour, the latest battle for the little urn is already shaping up as a race to the bottom.
The opening day in Adelaide, where a record-breaking 55,317 spectators flocked through the turnstiles for the first day-night men’s Test between Australia and England, should have been a celebration of the oldest rivalry in cricket getting a fresh twist under lights. Instead, it was a case of rinse and repeat from the back end of the Gabba Test and the fallout caused by the head-butt saga. The umpire, Aleem Dar, a passive soul, twice stepped in to remind the players that there are certain standards to be upheld and that the Rugby League World Cup final between the two countries was being staged 1,200 miles away.
England have clearly had enough of being on the receiving end of Australia’s on-field chuntering and what they believed was an orchestrated attempt to rev up Jonny Bairstow’s social faux-pas with Cameron Bancroft at the start of the tour. A new hard-nosed policy is in place, with the man they perceived to be laughing at them at the end of the first Test – Steve Smith – now the prime target.
After the wicket of David Warner, whose earlier homicidal call had led to Bancroft being run out and Stuart Broad pointedly stick his fingers in his ears towards the guilty party, the Australia captain strode out to the middle. Things appeared quiet at first but it did not take long before Broad was exchanging views with the right‑hander, who fired back in turn. Though hard to decipher the exact words, it was clear the pros and cons of Adelaide council’s mooted congestion charge was not the topic of debate.
Anderson, whose use of the word bullies in a pre-match column for the Telegraph had prompted Smith to remind him of his own partiality for a word or two, then got involved. Placing himself at a short mid-on while Smith was at the non-striker’s end, more eyeballing, posturing and general twaddle ensued before Dar once again had to act.
Did the tactic work? Certainly Smith seemed slightly unsettled at the crease. Having last week ground England into the Brisbane dirt with an unbeaten 141, he eventually perished on 40 when, having apparently sledged Craig Overton about his lack of pace, the debutant lit up the Zing bails with a ball that cannoned off pad and bat.
Though England were pretty boorish here, it must be said, perhaps Smith will now reconsider his assertion that the officials should decide where the line be drawn. Those words showed a leader out of touch with one of the oldest codes of the sport: namely the two captains are responsible for the tone in which a match is played.
But then maybe the spectators who had flocked down from the bustling cafes and bars (and massage establishments) of Hindley Street, and crossed the snaking footbridge over the river Torrens towards this giant multipurpose stadium, had parted with their cash for such a battle.
It is fair to say they did not quite receive the full day-night experience sold in the brochure. A near 20-degree drop from some punishing temperatures at the start of the week, and the showery clouds that kept sweeping across the ground and breaking up play, meant they were denied the balmy evening of salmon skies witnessed in the previous two years here.
The stands were thinner after the delayed dinner break than at any stage of the day, with the Village Green area to the back of the Chappell Stand swamped by the drinkers. A nd the cricket never quite crackled into life, however hard the players tried to antagonise each other, with the pink Kookaburra still not producing the most attractive cricket.
Nevertheless, this was a record gate for a cricket match here of 55,317, smashing Big Bash figures and the Test‑best 50,962 that turned up to watch day two of the Bodyline encounter in 1933. Australian rules football may have once brought more back in the day but not since the ground was converted from its quaint old the terracotta-roofed past life into a horse-shoed beast that, for all the modernisation, has still retained much of the history and charm.
It is something of an open secret that Adelaide Oval is likely to never again witness a daytime Test. The local cricket association is intent on becoming the spiritual home for the pink ball format, as the scene of its birth two years ago. On that occasion Australia and New Zealand reportedly split a million-dollar sweetener to act as the guinea pigs. This time around, from what we have seen thus far, you sense they would sooner set fire to the loot than see their opponent also benefit.


Odsonne Edouard grabbed a stunning hat-trick as Celtic cruised to a 5-1 Premiership win against Motherwell at Parkhead. The 19-year-old striker, on loan from Paris St-Germain, was one of six changes made by Brendan Rodgers with an eye on Tuesday’s Champions League game against Anderlecht. Edouard struck from close range in the 16th minute and then from the edge of the box before the break.
In the third meeting between the clubs in a week, Motherwell’s half-time substitute Elliott Frear scored against the run of play in the 65th minute but the Celtic sub James Forrest restored the home side’s two-goal advantage and then completed the rout after Edouard added a fourth with six minutes remaining. The champions extended their unbeaten domestic run to 67 games to go seven points clear of Aberdeen at the top of the table.
With his fellow Frenchman Moussa Dembélé working his way back from an ankle injury and Leigh Griffiths starting on the bench, Edouard led the line with Jonny Hayes, Kristofer Ajer, Olivier Ntcham, Tom Rogic and Scott Sinclair also back.
The home side took the lead with their first real chance. Ntcham set up Sinclair and his cut-back from the byline was tapped in from six yards by Edouard for his first goal at Celtic Park in his third start.
His second in the 33rd minute was just as straightforward, taking a Rogic pass and approaching the Motherwell penalty area before driving through the legs of the back-tracking Motherwell stand-in captain, Peter Hartley, and into the far corner. The Celtic captain, Scott Brown, had earlier been booked for a foul on Louis Moult and he then had to come off for treatment to his face after a challenge by the Motherwell striker amid signs that the game could boil over.
Four minutes from the break Rogic had the ball in the Motherwell net but a very late flag by the assistant referee ruled it out, to the anger of the home fans.
Carl McHugh and Frear came on for the start of the second half but Celtic continued to dominate. Edouard headed a Sinclair cross wide from eight yards before Hayes, an endless source of danger down the right, scuffed an effort wide and the Motherwell goalkeeper Trevor Carson kept out a Mikael Lustig drive. In the 64th minute Carson made an unorthodox save from an Ntcham free-kick before Tierney hammered the rebound wide.
It all appeared easy enough for Celtic but they were stunned a minute later when, in a rare Fir Park attack, Frear stabbed in a Richard Tait cross from inside the six-yard box. Rodgers brought on Callum McGregor and Forrest and in the 75th minute the latter cut in on to his left foot inside the box before firing into the far corner.
Carson tipped a Forrest shot over the bar before, in the 84th minute, Tait’s headed back-pass to his keeper was pounced on by Edouard who slipped it past Carson. And there was still time for Forrest to bend in a fifth.
After the match Rodgers hit out at Motherwell’s hierarchy after the Lanarkshire club issued a statement in which they revealed they had sought answers from the Scottish Football Association about contentious penalty decisions in the previous two matches against Celtic. The statement also said they would probe alleged acts of vandalism in the away stand at Fir Park.
“There was a debate around the honesty and professionalism of the Celtic players and also a question asked of the supporters,” Rodgers said. “It is not a debate. These are players who have got to 67 games unbeaten because of their professionalism, their honesty and how they devote their life to their profession. Along with their supporters, they have been absolutely brilliant.”


If this showed why Everton hired Sam Allardyce, the reasons for his recruitment were confirmed at a stroke. The 63-year-old may be a one-man guarantee against relegation but his new team now reside in the top half of the table. Perhaps panic, rather than necessity, accounted for his arrival, but this debut win had the stamp of classic Allardyce.
“The fans, players, staff and owners can breathe a little easier,” said the first man to manage seven Premier League clubs after offering a snapshot of why the previous six had deemed him eminently employable. There was Allardyce’s trademark clean sheet, already equalling the tallies his predecessors, Ronald Koeman and David Unsworth, managed in the league, even if Huddersfield’s drought on the road, which dates back to their opening-day win at Crystal Palace, helped account for it.
“Defensively did Huddersfield have a chance today?” asked Allardyce, aware of the answer to his own question. “That gave us a platform to go on and win the game.”
He has long shown a capacity to win the winnable games, and home matches against promoted clubs on losing runs belong firmly in that category. “It is not about four losses in a row,” insisted the Huddersfield manager David Wagner. “Every game has its own story.”
But this was a sequel in the Allardyce saga. Few have procured more points from forgettable fare. “It could have been better for entertainment, more passing and moving, but we can build on that as we go on,” he said. Allardyce’s reputation for ugly effectiveness precedes him. He is likely to keep Everton up and it probably will not be pretty. One high-class goal was out of keeping with a low-calibre game. The pragmatist in Allardyce was never going to reject another that contained an element of luck.
Equally, the opener illustrated the latent talent in Everton’s ranks. Cuco Martina recorded their first shot on target under the new manager. It was also the only one before the interval. Then came Allardyce’s first decisive intervention; Aaron Lennon and Gylfi Sigurdsson were ordered to stay further upfield. The Icelander, who had looked anything but a £45m player before then, duly delivered his most meaningful goal since his club-record transfer from Swansea. Wayne Rooney instigated the move, picking out Dominic Calvert-Lewin, who pierced the offside trap with a backheel flick for Sigurdsson to convert.
Everton soon acquired a taste for backheel flicks. Lennon released Calvert-Lewin with another, Jonas Lössl parrying the striker’s shot. With Huddersfield now committing more men forward, they were caught on the counterattack. Rooney sent Calvert-Lewin running clear and the 20-year-old’s shot was deflected over Lössl by the unwitting Mathias Jorgensen.
It meant the stand-in captain and youthful centre-forward were involved in both goals. While a less garlanded figure in the No10 shirt, Huddersfield’s Aaron Mooy, was the game’s outstanding individual in the first half, Rooney grew in influence. He was Allardyce’s on-field lieutenant, enforcing positional discipline as he barked orders. Everton were at pains to ensure they were not caught with too many men ahead of the ball. Indeed, Allardyce suggested they were initially too cautious, too scarred by past defeats.
The newcomer retained the personnel that Unsworth, now happily ensconced in the directors box, selected for the 4-0 win over against West Ham, but a 4-3-3 formation that became 4-5-1 out of possession was familiar to long-time Allardyce-watchers. Less typical, given his emphasis on dead-ball situations, were some wretched set-pieces from Sigurdsson.
It is easy to imagine where Allardyce’s attention may be concentrated. He and Everton have the feel of a marriage of convenience. Their circumstances produce strange bedfellows. There was the incongruous sight of Bill Kenwright, the committed Evertonian, hugging the Liverpool loyalist Sammy Lee, who has joined Allardyce’s backroom staff. Both had the sense not to embrace the nearby Duncan Ferguson.
There were no choruses of Allardyce’s name, except when the Huddersfield fans chanted first that Wagner was better and then thinner than his Everton counterpart. Allardyce nonetheless described his reception as “brilliant” and he got a louder welcome before kick-off than Speedo Mick, a fundraising Everton fan who appeared on the pitch in the swimming trunks that account for his nickname.
If Everton were sinking, Allardyce was appointed precisely because he can get imperilled teams buoyant again. His impact is apparent already.


Talk of Burnley qualifying for Europe was dealt a sobering blow with defeat at improving Leicester, thanks to an early goal from Demarai Gray.
It has mainly been those outside of Turf Moor who have contemplated the possibility of a first European campaign for the club since 1960-61 but some fans have begun to dream following Sean Dyche’s side’s surprise start to the campaign, with the owners of one pub in the Lancashire town promising to rename their establishment the Royal Dyche should the team qualify for either the Europa League or Champions League.
Burnley’s opponents were a reminder of what can be achieved against the odds and the 2015-16 Premier League champions continued their own upward trajectory with a 1-0 success on Saturday courtesy of Gray.But Leicester have impressed under Claude Puel, too, and this was a third win in his six matches in charge, while the loss saw Burnley slip to seventh in the table.
After victory against Tottenham in midweek Puel had warned his team not to underestimate Burnley and they heeded his advice by taking the lead after six minutes. Riyad Mahrez’s inswinging cross from the left looked to be creeping in at the far post, forcing Nick Pope to dive to his right and push the ball away. But he could only parry it into the path of the oncoming Gray, who hurt himself on the frame of the goal as he slid in to finish from point-blank range.
Like Gray, Burnley recovered well and Chris Wood, a former Leicester player, quickly had a good chance to equalise. Phil Bardsley’s low cross was deflected into the path of Wood but the striker’s first touch with his chest was heavy and it allowed Kasper Schmeichel to smother the danger.
James Tarkowski headed wide from a corner and Johann Berg Gudmundsson worked Schmeichel again as the midway point of the first half approached. Burnley looked menacing once more after half an hour as Robbie Brady worked a shooting opportunity but Harry Maguire nicked the ball away as he pulled the trigger, resulting in a nasty-looking collision of shins. Both players laid on the ground in pain and after receiving some treatment Brady was carried from the field on a stretcher and replaced by Scott Arfield. The injury appeared to upset Burnley’s rhythm and Leicester assumed control. Mahrez worked Pope following a mazy run and Wes Morgan had an effort cleared off the line by Phil Bardsley.
Burnley remained a threat, though, and Schmeichel had to be alert to deny Steven Defour and then Gudmundsson, who was put through on goal by Jeff Hendrick’s pass. Back at the other end, Gray came close to a second goal midway through the second half when he steered a shot goalwards which clipped the outside of a post, before Pope saved well from Marc Albrighton and Vardy.
There were chances at both ends in injury time, as Leicester survived a heart-stopping moment when Gudmundsson’s low cross deflected straight into the arms of Schmeichel, while Pope made a good save to deny Mahrez.
“Overall it was tight,” said Dyche, who also confirmed that Brady had been taken to hospital for treatment. “It was a really soft goal to concede. That was unlike us, we usually smell danger much quicker than that.”


Having to improvise a new look did not stop Liverpool from parading their customary attacking brio on the Sussex coast and where Brighton have never had it so bad – at least at the Amex Stadium. They moved in six years ago and their current manager, Chris Hughton, declared Liverpool to be the best team they have faced this season – which is high praise considering that the only other visitors to win here were Manchester City.
The endorsement seemed justified because Liverpool were scintillating going forward, with Mohamed Salah, Roberto Firmino and Philippe Coutinho exceptional as Jürgen Klopp’s team brought their goal tally to 15 from their last four away matches.
Yet Klopp was not quite as impressed as Hughton. “Results-wise it looks like we’re flying but we’re not,” said the German, who bemoaned a 10-minute spell in the second half during which his team conceded a goal and risked losing control of the match.
The frequency of such periods is, perhaps, the chief difference between them and Manchester City. This time, at least, there were mitigating factors.
Joël Matip’s injury and Ragnar Klavan’s illness forced Klopp into a newlook formation in which Emre Can and Georgino Wijnaldum flanked Dejan Lovren in a three-man defence.
With Trent Alexander-Arnold and Andy Robertson playing as wing-backs, Liverpool’s backline had an avant-garde look. But the shape was mostly anecdotal as Liverpool were fluid and devastating when in possession, which was most of the time.
Brighton found it quite the brain-teaser. They were stumped by the visitors’ speed and movement, especially in the first half.
Salah fired off the first shot after less than 30 seconds, signalling the fusillade that was to come.
Salah and Firmino both went close again before Brighton exposed any uncertainty in Liverpool’s rejigged defence. That was in the 17th minute, but Glenn Murray miscued after Can and Lovren failed to cut out a cross by Izzy Brown. It was the last glimpse that the home side would get of Liverpool’s net before the match was put beyond them by two goals in 79 seconds.
On the half-hour, Can sent a powerful header into the net from a corner by Coutinho. Then Liverpool doubled their lead with a breakneck counterattack, Salah leading the charge before flipping the ball wide to Coutinho, whose low pass from the left was turned in by Firmino.
With Sadio Mané resting on the bench in advance of Wednesday’s decisive Champions League tie at home to Spartak Moscow, Coutinho was Liverpool’s ringmaster, tormenting Brighton with the sort of flourishes that prompted Barcelona try to sign him in the summer. Yet Liverpool’s habit of frittering away leads means opponents can always hope for a comeback.
Brighton evidently still believed it was possible when they emerged after half-time, and their faith would have been rewarded within two minutes if not for a brilliant save by Simon Mignolet. Brown created the chance by sneaking into the space behind Alexander-Arnold, but Mignolet saved Murray’s close-range volley with his feet.
Before Brighton knew it, they were three goals down, Liverpool racing up the other end of the pitch for Firmino to finish emphatically after being served by Salah.
Three minutes later, however, Brighton narrowed the gap. This time it was Liverpool who did not grasp what was happening. The referee, Graham Scott, awarded the home team a penalty for an offence he saw as the ball was floated in from a corner. Liverpool’s defenders looked bemused, but Murray asked no questions and converted from the penalty spot.
Liverpool did not disintegrate. They blew Brighton to pieces. Coutinho crowned his regal performance with a goal of craft and slyness.
Anticipating that Brighton’s players would jump, the Brazilian drilled a 20-yard free-kick under the wall and into the net.
“Credit to the analysts,” said Klopp, explaining that Liverpool’s backroom staff had tipped off Coutinho about the behaviour of Brighton’s wall. “But you still have to have the skill to do it,” added the manager in praise of the Brazilian, who scored a similar goal against West Ham United last year.
Hughton described the dilemma facing opposing teams when Coutinho is standing over a free-kick. “If you don’t jump, he whips it into the top corner,” he said. “You have to give the credit to the player.”
Lewis Dunk would have liked Coutinho to be credited with Liverpool’s fifth goal, too, otherwise the record must identify the Brighton defender as the culprit, as he inadvertently diverted the Brazilian midfielder’s shot into his own goal in the 89th minute.


Paul Clement sounded like a beaten man. A ninth defeat in 12 Premier League matches, on a day when Stoke City appeared to be there for the taking, leaves Swansea City bottom of the table and prompted their manager to deliver a scathing assessment.
It is a wretched run of results at any level and raises serious questions about how much longer Swansea’s owners are willing to tolerate the sight of the club sliding inexorably towards the Championship. Clement expressed his hope that he would be given more time, yet he also gave the impression that he is as fed up as anyone.
Stoke were obliging opponents in many ways although Swansea never had enough about them to score again after conceding twice in the space of four chaotic first-half minutes. Xherdan Shaqiri and Mame Diouf scored those goals, punishing some abject defending after Wilfried Bony had netted against his former club.
“I believe we’ve gone bottom of the table and I can’t say that we’re unlucky,” Clement said. “We’ve lost 10 games now. It’s not been through misfortune. We deserve to be bottom because we’re not consistent enough through a 90-minute period.”
Leroy Fer was at fault for Stoke’s first goal, with the midfielder carelessly losing possession 30 yards out, and Clement made the point that the defending was not much better prior to the home team’s second, when Swansea dropped far too deep as Peter Crouch flicked on for Diouf to hammer home. “Then, very characteristic of us at this point, mentally we’re not in a good state, you go down having led and we didn’t play well from that point,” he said.
Swansea enjoyed plenty of possession in the second half, but as has been the case throughout the season, it was hard to see them scoring. Bony’s goal – a brilliantly taken first-time volley from Martin Olsson’s cross – was their first since October.
It says it all that the closest the visitors came to equalising in the second period was when Jack Butland tipped over a header from Ryan Shawcross, the Stoke defender. “It’s the same thing,” Clement said. “We’re a toothless team. Offensively we’re nowhere near good enough, we don’t create enough, we don’t score enough. That’s our biggest issue.”
When it was pointed out to Clement that he had been scathing of his own team, he said: “When I am scathing about my team I am scathing of myself. It is not me pointing the finger and saying: ‘It is his fault’. It is a collective effort. I cannot win without the players. So I am being more self-critical because I have to be better and get more out of this team.”
The key question is whether Clement, who had described this game as a Cup final beforehand, will get the opportunity. “Those kind of things are very much out of the hands of the manager or a coach,” he said.
“That will always be down to the chairman and the ownership to make those decisions if the situation is going in a really bad direction and you can’t see any chance of changing it.
“I believe I can [change it]. I showed last year I am capable of working at this level with 29 points over 19 games. It was a big effort. It is nowhere near as good this season.”
For Stoke, who were relieved to pick up their second victory in eight matches, the league table makes for much better reading now that they are up to 13th position. Shaqiri took his goal well following a lovely through ball from midfielder Joe Allen and the dangerous Diouf was close to adding a third when he headed the ball wide in the second half.
“It would have been very easy to feel sorry for ourselves [after Bony’s goal],” Mark Hughes, Stoke’s manager, said. “But I didn’t see any evidence of that.”


Forget the competitive-looking final scoreline. For the majority of the contest this was the most one-sided of West Country derbies with the hosts so rampant their supporters were serenading them with chants of “Olé, Olé!” Exeter are not champions of England by chance and here was further proof it will take an extremely good side to wrest their title away from them.
There is no certainly no doubt who is presently bossing the Premiership table. The Chiefs, if only for 24 hours, now stand eight points ahead of their closest rivals with the season not yet at its halfway point. “We were well and truly schooled,” said Todd Blackadder, Bath’s director of rugby. “I doubt you could put a better first half together than they showed today. If they keep playing like that I don’t think anyone will get close to them.”
This six-try masterclass, spoiled only by four leaked tries in the final quarter with victory already assured, was certainly the best display Exeter have ever produced against Bath. They had a bonus point safely stowed away inside 36 minutes, reflecting their utter dominance in every area, and led 42-10 with eight minutes remaining. Alec Hepburn, Sam Skinner, Don Armand, Matt Kvesic and James Short are not currently in England’s plans but they were all outstanding here.
Kvesic and Armand, in particular, were everywhere, driving Bath to distraction and back. The odd misplaced midfield pass aside there was a energy to their work with and without the ball which Bath, for all their international contingent, never came close to matching. For Chiefs fans it was like an all-you-can-eat buffet, as well as a very tasty appetiser for their back-to-back European ties with Leinster.
Bath will find even their next opponents Toulon a relative relief after this. Inside eight minutes Luke Cowan-Dickie had been driven over from a trademark Chiefs rolling maul before a neat pass from Ollie Woodman gave Short half a yard in which to remind Semesa Rokoduguni and Anthony Watson there are other dangerous finishers in England. Even Bath’s solitary points of the first half came at a cost with the Chiefs’ claiming the subsequent restart and storming straight back upfield to put the mountainous Mitch Lees under the posts.
There was a certain inevitability about the fourth try by Armand after Exeter, not for the first time, opted to kick a penalty for the corner rather than the posts.
Bath’s owner, Bruce Craig, could be seen in deep conversation with his assistant coach Toby Booth at the interval, not looking the world’s most contented multi-millionaire, and the visitors’ second-half mini-revival arrived not a moment too soon.
By that point, though, a revitalised Thomas Waldrom and the ever-influential Gareth Steenson had already guaranteed their side’s ninth successive win in all competitions, with Jack Nowell and Sam Simmonds playing only cameo roles and their England centre Henry Slade not required. Keep playing in this fashion and, as Blackadder says, Exeter will take a lot of stopping regardless of whom they play.

The last word in the autumn internationals went to Leigh Halfpenny, his penalty settling a reasonably entertaining game between two weakened sides just when South Africa had overturned what was at one stage an 18-point deficit. Halfpenny’s kick would only have been a leveller had Handré Pollard not hit a post after scoring his side’s second try, but Wales could take more out of the game than the Springboks, who often played as if they had been lobotomised.
One of the game’s superpowers have become mind-numbingly ordinary, having to battle back from two early sucker punches. For all the virtue of persisting with players based at home to try to contain an exodus to Europe and Japan, their game is already so denuded that what used to be one of the game’s surest foundations now resembles a sandcastle.
Their best players are elsewhere, although here the hooker Malcolm Marx was a man-of-the-match contender, forcing turnovers and carrying with purpose.
After two years drifting towards the bottom, South Africa have a decision to make before 2019 because the back division they fielded against Wales had no more wit than that paraded by Georgia two weeks before.
Wales, who were without 16 players through injury and unavailability, scored two tries in the opening seven minutes that were stunning in their simplicity, born on the training ground by coaches who had noticed how South Africa had defended on this tour with the organisation skills and basic understanding of a struggling second division side. They expected Wales to run after watching their first three matches and were nonplussed when they found their opponents had not kicked an old habit.
The first try came from a scrum on halfway. It was a reset after Wales had been pushed off the ball and when the prop Scott Andrews buckled under pressure, Taulupe Faletau got the ball away quickly. When it reached the fly-half Dan Biggar, he chipped across the field for Hallam Amos on the right wing whose opposite number Warrick Gelant had drifted infield.
Scott Williams scored the try after Amos drew what there was of the cover defence and three minutes later his midfield Hadleigh Parkes marked his debut with a try after Biggar, following a lineout, had foiled the blitz defence by prodding the ball into space behind with the full-back Andries Coetzee, whose afternoon started awfully and got worse, absent without leave.
Coetzee, who under the high ball was as reliable as an umbrella in a hurricane, wasted turnover possession by dithering over whether to run, pass or kick. By the time he made up his mind, Biggar had anticipated the latter and charged the ball down for Faletau to pick up and smartly pass to Parkes for the centre’s second try on the half-hour.
Faletau was offside when Biggar made contact with the ball, but the try was not reviewed. The television match official had been called into action 16 minutes before when Marx finished off a driving maul. The ball was on the line when he was pulled to his feet by team-mates, but none of the three TV angles provided for review allowed the official to give a positive answer to the question posed to him by the referee, Jérôme Garcès: try, yes or no?
South Africa pulled back to 21-10 at the interval. Pollard’s penalty in between Parkes’s tries was followed by Gelant scoring on his first full appearance. The wing knocked the ball on and Biggar’s kick led to another try after Dillyn Leyds ran out of defence for Jesse Kriel to kick to the line and Gelant to outpace Aled Davies.
South Africa had more purpose after the break when the coaches pointed out where they had gone wrong, needing all 15 minutes, and were ahead in 14 minutes. They attacked the gainline and when Pollard scored following a lineout, Kriel gave them the lead after Marx’s flat, at best, cut-out pass gave him space on the left wing.
With Biggar off the field with concussion, South Africa should have sealed victory comfortably. Superior up front and on the floor, they just needed an element of control but their replacement backs added nothing and they finished as they had started after Halfpenny’s penalty had restored Wales’s lead, desperately needing direction.
Their head coach, Allister Coetzee, mounted a passionate defence of his position, saying that while last year had been a “fiasco”, there had been a marked improvement in 2017 having started over again with players based in the country. Yet nothing depicts South Africa’s decline more than their captain, Eben Etzebeth, who was once counted among the world’s best second rows but has been sapped by the mediocrity of the game in his country. His match ended when, with seconds remaining in the opening half, he was injured throwing an improbable off-load in his 22 – the mighty fallen.

Bath are likely to face disciplinary action after releasing Taulupe Faletau for Wales’s final autumn international against South Africa on Saturday, a Test that lies outside the official window.
Premiership Rugby has a policy that prevents clubs from releasing non-England players for these Tests and so are not governed by the regulation obliging them to make players available to national sides. It was waived last year as a goodwill gesture, when Wales’s extra international fell on an Anglo-Welsh weekend but Premiership Rugby has said the policy was being applied this weekend, when Bath are at the champions Exeter.
Bath confirmed they had released Faletau to play against South Africa in defiance of Premiership Rugby’s rule, saying in a statement: “We continue to support the objective of resolving the club and international calendar for the benefit of players, clubs and unions, which would prevent this being an issue in the future.”
Four years ago Northampton were fined £60,000 for releasing their wing George North to play for Wales outside the official Test window. His contract included a clause that gave him the right to join up with Wales whenever called upon. Premiership Rugby referred the issue to an independent disciplinary panel that concluded the contract breached a rule that had been unanimously agreed by the clubs.
Bath will face a similar sanction although Northampton’s fine covered all three years of North’s contract. The ultimate punishment is some kind of points deduction, but that is unlikely.
Warren Gatland, who on Tuesday lost lock Jake Ball and flanker Justin Tipuric from his squad due to injury, was last week asked whether he would have any of his England-based players for the match against South Africa. “We know that Toby [Taulupe] is available to us and I hope Jamie Roberts [the Harlequins centre] is,” he replied at the time. However, Faletau, who is understood to have a clause in his contract allowing his release for national duty, is expected to be the only Premiership player involved for Wales.
Five of the Wales 23 involved in last weekend’s match against New Zealand are based in England. The Gloucester centre Owen Williams and the Exeter prop Tomas Francis reported for duty with their clubs on Monday, along with the South Africa wing forward Francois Louw , who is a back-row colleague of Faletau’s at Bath. Faletau was with Wales.
South Africa’s head coach, Allister Coetzee, asked if he would be aggrieved if Faletau played for Wales when he had been obliged to release Louw back to Bath, said: “I just follow regulation nine and, from our point of view, Francois Louw is definitely not available for us. I cannot comment on the internal arrangement in the north but, if there is any agreement, I do not know about it.”
One Wales player who will not have to worry about the regulation next season is the Gloucester and Lions flanker Ross Moriarty. He is joining the Dragons in the summer, ensuring that he will not be snared by a rule coming into force next season that stipulates any player who signs a contract with a club outside Wales will not be available for the national side unless he has reached 60 caps.


An eight-race card on the Fibresand at Southwell may not everyone’s idea of fun when the jumps season is in full stride and Newbury’s big pre-Christmas meeting is only a few days away. But I yield to no one in my affection for the track, and a conversation with the excellent apprentice jockey Shelley Birkett yesterday – she happened to be sitting next to me at the Ladbrokes Trophy lunch – only added to it.
Birkett has ridden 10 winners from only 76 rides at Southwell over the past five seasons, more than at any track bar Lingfield, and while she confirms that the kickback from the Fibresand is deeply unpleasant – “like needles being fired at your face” – she also feels that Southwell is an easy track to ride, “because your horse either likes it or it doesn’t”, both in terms of the surface itself and also the strong pace at which many of the races are run.
For me, this makes Southwell even more of a track for specialists than Brighton or Epsom, and the best time to catch them is before their liking for the place has been fully advertised.
One candidate to catch the eye today is Gatillo (3.40) – who will be ridden, oddly enough, by Shelley’s brother, Ross – in the amateurs’ race at the end of the card. The four-year-old is still a maiden after 13 starts, but has run well on two of his three starts at Southwell including his handicap debut in December last year when he finished a two-and-a-half length second off a mark of 70.
Nine subsequent races without success have seen his mark slip all the way down to 54, but a return to Southwell last time out prompted another return to form as Gatillo finished a close third in a Class 6 event. Today’s race is, if anything, even weaker than that one, and Gatillo is a very fair price at around 4-1 to finally get off the mark.
Bo Selecta (3.10) has a similar profile – a maiden who has been knocking on the door and has run well at Southwell in the past – while Becauseshesaidso (2.00) was not suited by a step up to three-and-a-quarter miles last time out and should benefit from the drop back to two-and-a-half on the jumps card at Lingfield.
Allchilledout (3.00) probably needed his comeback run at Chepstow and travelled well until making a mistake four out, and has several runs in the book which suggest he could be a big price at around 12-1 on the same card, while Derintoher Yank (2.20) is on a good run of form and it should continue at Sedgefield.

While many have concerns about the Football Association’s restructure of women’s football and this blog has highlighted many of them, others, such as Derby County Ladies, who have had long-held WSL ambitions, have thrown their support behind the plans.
The amateur club Ewe Rams, who currently play in the third tier, have made clear their intention to bid for a place in the new semi-professional second tier of the Women’s Super League when applications are opened to non-WSL clubs in March.
As an aspect of the applications for the revamped WSL2, clubs must meet a set of strict criteria detailed by the FA. One of those is that a club must provide evidence of having “a written agreement in place with its Club Community Organisation in its catchment area which records how the Club and Club Community Organisation will work in partnership to develop and promote the women’s game (at both junior and senior level) in its local community.” It must also have “an agreement in place with at least one further education and at least one higher education establishment.”
On Tuesday Derby County, in partnership with the University of Derby, announced the opening of applications for three full scholarships on the university’s football journalism course for women football players. While this latest scheme has been in the pipeline since last year, the partnership with the university will strengthen Derby’s bid and, they hope, will attract WSL level players to their team.
The University of Derby’s journalism department is no stranger to being experimental: two years ago it launched the first ever football journalism degree. It has become a hugely popular course, getting more than 200 applicants for the 25 places, but that has not meant the ambitions for the course have been satisfied.
The scholarships are the brainchild of the senior lecturer and freelance journalist Peter Lansley, who, having been challenged by his superiors to increase the numbers of women signing up, and having connections with the director and chairman of football at Derby County Ladies, saw an opportunity to bring things together for the benefit of the university, the club and most importantly for women footballers and women in journalism.
“I do actually think it’s a big deal. We’re unique in a way, because we’re the only football journalism undergraduate course and then, coupled with that, we are interested in trying to promote women in football both in terms of playing and in terms of journalism. So that’s why we’re launching this scholarship,” he says while shepherding a group of students at England Women’s sold-out World Cup qualifier against Bosnia & Herzegovina at Walsall’s Bescot Stadium.
The three who end up on the course next September will be relieved of the crippling £27,750 fees over the course of the degree. They will have to meet three criteria in order to be successful in their application; to be considered good enough by Derby County to play in WSL2, to be academically good enough to get on the course and to commit to playing for the university team.
“They will get all their strength and conditioning, all the sports science, through the university; they will basically be semi-professional but on my course,” says Lansley. “So it will boost women in sports journalism [helping change the rubbish figure of 1.8% of national newspaper sports bylines being from women], it will boost the profile of women’s football, it will boost standards at Derby and we can start helping the FA’s participation figures in our own little way.”
Having taken a group of students to the Netherlands for three weeks in the summer, to cover the Women’s Euros for a variety of national outlets, the course’s interest and commitment to boosting women’s football, and using it to boost the skills of its aspiring journalists, is more than evident.
Applications open on Tuesday and, with the deadline for Ucas applications on 15 January, the search for the three scholarship recipients begins in earnest. Lansley hopes it will have a knock-on effect of the courses intake: “What I’m hoping is it will have a cascade effect. Derby are out scouting and have their eyes open for players who would suit the programme. If, say, 12 apply for it, three get the scholarship and the others just miss out, well I might still get eight women on the course instead of four.”
And while he may have had the initial idea, he places a huge amount of credit at the feet of the head of journalism, Keith Perch, who set up the course, and who has the ambition of a 50:50 male to female intake and is a big advocate of women’s football. “I think it’s quite visionary because the numbers that are applying are going through the roof. But the traditional obstacles in front of women mean that it is going to be a slow burn,” says Lansley.
The course costs are met once Lansley hits the 25 student mark; any above that up to 28 and it does not cost much extra, bar some additional marking and tutorials, so the course essentially self-funds the scholarships.
Holly Percival, who scored the first goal in the university’s 2-1 win over Nottingham University Women’s 2nd XI last week, plays for a local side and, as a student on Lansley’s course, has produced a film for the launch of the scholarship programme and is excited about what initiatives such as this mean for the future of the industry.
“I think it’s going to be really good. You’ve already got players like Kelly Smith and Alex Scott making the breakthrough into sports journalism and this will increase that. It’s really going to help players improve their ability to analyse the game,” she says.
And the support from the university for the players balancing the course with studying will be key to its success: “The university are really accommodating, I play for the uni and a local team and the university is very understanding if I have to travel for an away game. They are happy to negotiate over coursework and assist where possible.”
Derby County Ladies, meanwhile, see this as a part of a wider plan of working towards the top sustainably. Their chief executive, Duncan Gibb, says: “When I joined the club back in 2013, we set out a five-year plan aimed at getting ourselves to the stage where we could not only progress to the next level but, equally importantly, retain that status once achieved.
“This project is one of several partnerships integral to our bid to stabilise at the top end of women’s football. It should provide us with three high-standard players on an annual basis that will allow them to not only slot seamlessly into the first team squad immediately, but enhance it,” he continues.
Being a women footballer is not easy. It is not a career showered in cash. Players below the very top – and even some in the top sides that are able to offer a more professional income – often work in other jobs and study alongside their football. They recognise that football will not set them up for life. Derby County and the university’s scholarships will give three players annually the chance to develop a career in football beyond playing and, it is hoped, keep more women in the game on and off the pitch.

When the Formula One season opened this year in Australia there was a genuine sense that it was a new start for the sport. An optimism informing fresh ideas was bouncing round the paddock with abandon. F1 had embraced new regulations, but what was driving the positivity was the sport’s new owner, Liberty Media, who had arrived with a vigorous commitment to taking it to a new and brighter future.
2017, then, was Liberty’s year zero. The company completed its acquisition of F1 in January and almost immediately removed Bernie Ecclestone, who had overseen its growth into a hugely successful and lucrative global sport. Ecclestone’s role in building the F1 behemoth is undeniable but he was also in charge while the previous owners, the private equity firm CVC, spent years doing nothing to promote the sport, instead relying on Ecclestone to ensure the constant flow of huge profits it yielded from revenues of up to $1.8bn a year.
Sidelining Ecclestone and appointing Chase Carey as CEO was a statement of intent. The sport was no longer to be seen simply as an asset to be strip-mined. Back at the outset Carey said: “I don’t think the one-man show for the past five or six years really enabled this sport to grow to its full potential.” Liberty set about remedying this with alacrity. One of its first decisions, to appoint Ross Brawn as sporting director, was an impressive opening. He was given the task of overseeing the future with more competition and closer racing the order of the day.
Sean Bratches was made head of commercial activities – overseeing the sport’s income, principally from promoters’ race fees, television rights and sponsorship. New offices were taken up in London and the number of F1 staff doubled.
Optimism at the opening race in Australia was unsurprising but it has been tempered by reality. After the season was wrapped up in Abu Dhabi on the weekend the F1 group had still not put any detail on its long-promised plans for the future.
It was Bratches who came under the microscope in Abu Dhabi. When asked how Liberty intended to address a range of issues he declined to provide any answers. “We are working on those plans but we are not going to sit here right now and enumerate our visions for the sport,” he said. “It is not something you just flick a switch and things happen. Things need to be invested in and nourished and brought to market. You will continue to see a cadence of announcements and changes. There is more to come.”
It is true that the new regime has made its presence felt at the track. Rules restricting team use of social media in the paddock were relaxed at pre-season testing, symptomatic of an attitude summed up by Carey that “the sport said ‘no’ too much and we have to start saying ‘yes’.”
Greater fan friendliness was a stated aim and here, too, there was action. A young fan in tears at Kimi Raikkonen’s retirement at Spain was whisked into the paddock to meet his hero – unthinkable under Ecclestone. The race also hosted the first “fan festival” – a more entertaining and inclusive revamp of the fans’ village – hosting driver appearances and offering greater paddock access. All of these were generally well received and drivers and team principals remain broadly positive in reaction to Liberty’s efforts.
Equally there were modifications that went unnoticed. At the Red Bull Ring the merchandising shop – previously closed because Ecclestone charged for the right to open it – was permitted to do business for nothing. And there was some very public promotion – for example, putting cars on the streets at the London live event and using announcer Michael Buffer as part of the full American razzmatazz at the US GP.
These moves were welcomed but were far from fundamental and in some areas Liberty still has much to do amid some grumbling in the paddock. One is addressing the discrepancy of payments between teams, with the intent of levelling the playing field and providing a more secure financial footing for the smaller outfits. Theoretically it cannot be dealt with until 2020 when the current concord agreement expires. But while there is some clamour for something to be done sooner, it appears the pot to divide among them is becoming smaller.
F1’s new start has not come cheap and the company revealed that in the last quarter the pool to be shared among the teams amounted to $273m, 13% down on last year’s $316m. The Mercedes non-executive director, Niki Lauda, expressed a fundamental concern. “In the face of cost growth of some $70m from one year to the next, revenues have declined,” he said. “There should be ideas for generating more money but I do not see them.”
Promoters, who do generate money for F1, have also yet to see any great shift from the previous era. Liberty have said they will not be lowering fees but instead want promoters to recoup their outlay by creating bigger, better events. What this entails remains unclear. Silverstone, a circuit that is a sell out but cannot make money, exercised its break clause on hosting the British Grand Prix this year. Carey’s aim of “bigger spectacles” is hard to execute at many circuits that are a long way from cities.
Equally potential budget caps and agreement on new engine regulations for 2021 are two difficult-to-resolve short-term issues that still have to be thrashed out. Ferrari have already threatened to leave the sport, following disquiet over engine proposals voiced by Mercedes and Red Bull at the beginning of this month.
Embracing the digital-social future, which Brawn promised at Abu Dhabi, would bring major advances in 2018 and is also a cornerstone of Liberty’s plans. Here a sense of direction can be inferred. F1 has done a deal for ESPN to broadcast the sport in the US in return for F1 being allowed to sell races in the region on a streaming platform. It is a model Liberty intend to pursue but one that will take time and investment to show a return.
The full picture has yet to emerge and Liberty has made a point of not doing business in public or via the press. Expecting a complete overhaul in so short a time would be unfair. It revealed a new logo for the sport in Abu Dhabi, not well-received by fans or drivers, but that is a storm easily weathered. With the honeymoon period now over, expectations remain high and Liberty still has much to prove.


The Manchester United manager José Mourinho, who has always come across as a bit of a Ned Flanders, is apparently planning to turn Old Trafford into a Salford-based branch of The Leftorium. Alarmed at the balance of his squad, Mourinho is targeting four lefties in the summer: Tottenham Hotspur’s Danny Rose, Real Madrid’s Gareth Bale, Atlético Madrid’s Antoine Griezmann and Arsenal’s Mesut Özil. Ian Wright reckons that United, who also like the look of Chelsea’s right-footed Brazilian Willian, will nab Özil before the German’s contract runs out next summer. “Mesut Özil on a free to Manchester United looks a shoo-in,” the former Arsenal striker said.
But not if Barcelona get there first! The Primera Liga leaders are also looking to spruce up their squad in January and reckon that Özil would fit the bill. Unfortunately Lionel Messi is now dictating transfer policy at the Camp Nou and, like the Proper Football Men of Premier League punditry, he doesn’t seem to rate Özil. Messi has also told Barcelona not to sign Griezmann because of fears that the Frenchman would restrict Luis Suárez’s playing time – or maybe let the Uruguayan have the rest he’s so obviously been crying out for over the past year – and instead wants them to reignite their interest in Liverpool’s Philippe Coutinho.
Harry Kane has told “pals” that he fancies a move to Real Madrid. That’s according to reports in the Spanish media, so there’s every reason to believe that one. Tottenham, meanwhile, plan to replace Rose with Fulham’s Ryan Sessegnon. Or they could make Bale their new left-back.
Everton have gone crawling back to Sam Allardyce – who will take the job as long as his demands are met, so they’d better start making space for Juusi Jaaskelainen, Joey O’Brien and Kevin Nolan. Someone tell Phil Brown the band’s getting back together.
Chelsea have been offered the chance to sign Borussia Dortmund’s sulky Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, because of course that mild-mannered dressing room requires the addition of a player who was recently dropped for a big game for disciplinary reasons. Dortmund will console themselves by signing Angel Gomes from United.
Manchester City want Real Sociedad’s Iñigo Martínez. A new centre-back? Won’t someone think of Eliaquim Mangala? No? Anyone? Hello?


The choice of Eddie Jones as World Rugby Coach of the Year was hardly the most startling news ever to emerge from Monte Carlo. Like a race leader at the Monaco Grand Prix, opportunities to overtake his England side have been few this calendar year, with only Ireland doing so back in March. England still lifted the Six Nations title for the second successive year and under Jones have won 22 of their 23 games.
This raises three increasingly interesting questions. The first is simple enough: who will be the next side to defeat Jones’s increasingly confident mob? England are due to play 12 Tests in 2018 and their schedule, even at this distance, looks appreciably more demanding than it was this year. Italy (a), Wales (h), Scotland (a), France (a) and Ireland (h) is no one’s idea of a cosy Six Nations fixture list, with a three‑Test tour to South Africa and home November Tests against the Springboks, New Zealand, Japan and Australia to follow. Win the lot and Eddie will merit emperor status.
Suddenly, all too soon, it will be 2019 and a World Cup in Japan which Jones, from day one, has been aiming towards. With the tireless Australian it can pay to take a step back and study his actions, rather than hang endlessly on his every word. Many of his trademark rasping quips are designed for short-term diversionary effect anyway, freeing up his players to concentrate on their rugby. Behind the scenes England have been made to sweat more than at any point since they were last world champions in 2003. Even Jones’s adversaries cannot help but admire his single-minded work ethic.
Of late he has had the hump with the media in general, irritated by the less than rapturous reaction to England’s win against Argentina and the manner in which one or two of his remarks before the Australia game were construed in print. These are minor details in the normal scheme of things but not when Jones perceives people are starting to take him a shade lightly. He wants the press eating out of his hand, not nipping his fingertips.
No one disputes, however, that coaching England is a demanding job, even with the enviable financial resources at Jones’s disposal. Which begs the second key question du jour: who out there has the gale-force of personality, the front-of-house chutzpah, the tactical aptitude and the burning desire to take over from the former Wallabies and Japan head coach when, as he has continually stressed, he steps aside in under two years’ time? The more wins England secure under Jones in 2018 and 2019, the higher the bar will be set for his successor.
So far the Rugby Football Union has merely indicated it will scour the world for the best available candidate and that Jones’s opinion will be canvassed. Privately it knows it may not be a straightforward process. Steve Hansen’s hugely productive stint with the All Blacks will soon be entering its closing laps but coaching England hardly tops his to-do list. Warren Gatland? Not impossible, with New Zealand Rugby more likely to anoint Hansen’s deputy Ian Foster, but probably a long shot.
Few are more savvy than Ireland’s Joe Schmidt but would he really want to coach another European nation? Andy Farrell’s name will certainly re-enter the frame, as will Steve Borthwick’s, if a homegrown coach is desired. But hold on. These are familiar faces and the best shortlists require at least a couple of thought-provoking candidates to keep everybody else honest.
Which is why Scotland’s fast start under Gregor Townsend will be interesting to the RFU. Townsend is a mere 44 years old and has served a long coaching apprenticeship with Glasgow. If he can build so quickly on the foundations laid by Vern Cotter, could a bright Premiership coach not do something similar? Saracens’ management have been the market leaders in tactical savvy for a while but Exeter, under Rob Baxter, Ali Hepher and Rob Hunter, have not lost to them in three attempts in 2017. Then there is Johan Ackermann, who is turning Gloucester round from a virtual standing start, and Dave Rennie, Townsend’s successor at Glasgow. Rennie’s sides play excellent rugby and, like Gatland and Schmidt before him, it appears he will have to coach at Test level overseas before the All Blacks consider him.
And the third question? Well, the British & Irish Lions will also require a head coach in South Africa in 2021. Townsend’s name is starting to be floated as a possibility but he will not want to leave Scotland in the lurch so soon. Better, surely, to go for a proven turnaround merchant, with a knowledge of the South African rugby environment and respect for the touring team’s rich heritage. Someone, in fact, last seen clutching a trophy in Monte Carlo on Sunday night. England’s looming loss could well prove the Lions’ gain.
The roll call of World Rugby’s award winners did not leave a great deal of room for argument. New Zealand supplied the men’s player of the year, Beauden Barrett, the outstanding female player, Portia Woodman, the young player of the year, Rieko Ioane, and the women’s sevens player of the year, Michaela Blyde. The Black Ferns also picked up the world team of the year award, having already won this year’s women’s World Cup. The rest of the world has little option but to up its game if it wants to prevent another blackwash in 12 months’ time.
Wales v South Africa. There is still one autumn Test remaining and neither side can afford to end the year limply. Now is the time for Wales, depleted or not, to show their more expansive style can win them Tests and for the Springboks to demonstrate their heavy defeat in Ireland was merely an aberration. A high-scoring draw might just suit all parties.


When Fuenlabrada’s bus rolls through the gates into the Santiago Bernabéu on Tuesday night, there will be an Englishman on board. In early July Conor O’Keefe, a 22-year-old goalkeeper and university student from Macclesfield, boarded a plane, hired a car and flew to Spain armed with nothing but a gigantic spreadsheet and Google Maps. There, he knocked on the door of every club within an hour radius until the third-division leaders invited him in; two months later, the Copa del Rey draw paired them with Real Madrid. And although he will not play, this is his team now – 48 clubs and hundreds of golden envelopes later.
“I rang my dad: ‘We’re going to Real Madrid,’” he says. Richard O’Keefe knew how long his son’s journey had been and how much further it still has to run: from Crewe to Macclesfield and a season spent travelling the north-west, turning out for nine different teams, a kind of supply goalkeeper always on call; from turning down a youth contract, instead playing as a two‑year “triallist” because it was the only way they would let him sit A-levels, to chasing clubs and agents; from joining Olympic high-jumpers and a former Rada-trained actor turned athletics coach named Fuzz Caan, to the home of Ronaldo, Bale and Benzema.
Everywhere he went, he was asked the same question: how tall are you? He is 6ft, which is, he kept getting told, not tall enough. But his refusal to be beaten – a photo showing him kick the crossbar proves he could compensate – led him to do something too few British players contemplate: seek opportunity abroad. One of only three English players in Spain, he sits on the bench at Fuenlabrada’s 9,000-capacity Fernando Torres stadium, just audible over the lawnmower crossing the pitch, and explains how he got here.
The third year of an international business studies degree requires a placement in industry or study abroad. O’Keefe chose both: the industry he chose was football; the location, Madrid. Or it was supposed to be: laughing, he recalls finding out the campus was actually in Getafe but at least it was good for his game. “I’d always enjoyed Spanish football and loved watching Iker Casillas: he was smaller and I could relate,” he says. “There was hope. Size is not such an issue. Claudio Bravo, Marc‑André ter Stegen and Keylor Navas are not massive but win titles. That showed me you didn’t have to be 6ft 4in.
“There’s unfounded debate that foreigners coming in make it harder for English players to build a career,” he says. “England Under-17s win the World Cup and it’s: ‘They’ll never have a chance to play first-team football.’ It’s such a closed point of view, not just for players but for managers. Whether that’s a culture thing – maybe we’re lazy, don’t push languages, or just don’t see ourselves abroad – I don’t know, but players think if they’re cut at 17, 21, it’s over. But there are 100-plus other countries in Fifa. Go and see if you can play somewhere else.
“If you don’t feel you can do it, do you really want it that much? Brazilians up sticks and go to the Ukraine, where it’s freezing cold, where they can’t speak, thousands of miles from home because they need to play. British players need to develop that attitude.”
We got on the flight on 12 July, rented a car, stayed in an Airbnb and did eight, nine, 10 clubs a day
It is one thing being prepared to go to play, another having somewhere to go to play. Agents ignored him. “I said to my parents: ‘If we can’t get an agent, we’ll just have to do what an agent does,’” he recalls. “So, I started a big Excel spreadsheet and listed all the clubs I could find from primera to the fifth tier. I went through every team in every league, found their addresses, put it into Google Maps and if it was within an hour of Madrid, it went in.”
Forty-eight clubs were included. “I put in the name of the club, the distance, the time it takes to drive, any detail I could find: office phone numbers, email addresses, staff. It took a week and looked great. I emailed them all. Nothing. But I had the addresses, so I thought: ‘I’m going to handwrite letters.’ I remembered an entrepreneur saying he wrote to investors in golden envelopes. If a letter turns up in a golden envelope you think: ‘Oh, that’s interesting.’ It’s not just a bill and you’re going to toss it.
“I went to Ryman and must have bought over a hundred golden envelopes – which, by the way, aren’t cheap. I sent two to every person on my spreadsheet, all handwritten in Spanish, translated by my girlfriend, Frankie. And the postman is my best mate, I’m down to the post office every day. ‘Yeah, more.’ They were lovely; helping lick stamps, weighing them, sending them off. “
Still nothing.
“So, I said: ‘Let’s go.’ I was like: ‘We’ve got our spreadsheet, we’ve got our addresses and we’ve got a week.’ We got on the flight on 12 July, rented a car, stayed in an Airbnb and did eight, nine, 10 clubs a day. Every club on the spreadsheet: Real Madrid, first team and B team, Atlético Madrid, the same, Getafe, Leganés, Rayo Vallecano, Fuenlabrada …
“At Atlético, I handed a security guard a letter for Cholo Simeone; at Real we never got near – the gate’s half a mile from the actual training ground. At Getafe and Leganés we got close: they let us watch training. Most were very kind and we got some face-time. I had these stock phrases I’d practise – I didn’t speak any Spanish – and then Frankie would talk. We spoke to people in club houses, left letters at reception, waited by gates, tried to catch coaches going in.”
One day the Rayo goalkeeper coach walked past as they were leaving another letter with the receptionist. They collared him and O’Keefe convinced him to let him train with the B team. But a text message one night a few weeks later broke bad news. They had signed a first-team goalkeeper, so the previous B‑team keeper, who had a contract O’Keefe didn’t, dropped into his place. “Bloody hell. I felt like a failure.”
In the meantime, though, Fuenlabrada had replied, too. “They told me they had four golden envelopes from me: two each for the manager and the goalkeeper coach,” he laughs. “They’re thinking: ‘Who’s the crazy English guy writing golden envelopes?’ They could’ve had a massive laugh and joke about it in the office, and just binned it but they appreciated the effort and got in touch.”
Last year we were playing Shepshed Dynamo in the FA Vase in front of 28 people at a ground called Butthole Lane
There, he joined first-team training with Pol Freixanet and Jordi Cordina. “Extraordinary keepers,” he says and experienced men who began at Málaga and Madrid respectively. Eventually, paperwork sorted, O’Keefe was registered for the B team, which, once the winter window opens, will make him eligible for the first team. He rates Manolo Rubio, the goalkeeper coach, as among the best, benefiting from a different perspective.
“English goalkeeping is very busy, very intense, very fast. Ten, 15 repetitions, sprinting everywhere. It’s speed, power and I always sought to excel at that but Manolo says: ‘You have all these things but your technique suffers as a result. You’re trying to do everything really fast.’ I train in gloves every day, which I never did. Another example: I always wanted to be in a Spanish rondo and you come here and realise it’s a session in itself. In the UK, you’re trying to ’meg your mate. It’s a laugh, trying to stitch people up. It’s fun here, yeah, but it’s training. You’ve started. You don’t want to be the worst in there.”
Is he? He is a goalkeeper after all. “Hmm,” he says. There’s a pause. “No,” he replies, eventually. “I was.”
And that’s the point. “I want to develop. You watch Ter Stegen distribute to both sides with both feet. I want to be a symmetrical goalkeeper: able to throw with both arms, distribute off the floor with both feet, half-volley, side-volley, open up the whole pitch. I feel myself improving. I came for that: to see, learn, experience.”
Quite an experience awaits. “Last year we were playing Shepshed Dynamo in the FA Vase in front of 28 people at a ground called Butthole Lane,” he says. “Now I’m part of a club going to the Bernabéu.” He’s been to Real Madrid before of course but this time is different; this time he will get through the door.


Joe Root has offered a pointed reminder to Australia’s emboldened players that for all their talk of reopening psychological scars before Thursday’s first Test at the Gabba, it is England who have been the dominant force during recent Ashes encounters.
The buildup to the opener in Brisbane has been awash with macho soundbites emanating chiefly from the home side, who have spoken of targeting players, unleashing bouncers and waging war – all with the whitewash of 2013-14 referenced heavily throughout.
But with the time for such chatter now coming to an end, a slightly bemused Root maintained England remain calm and focused as they look to defend the urn they won in 2015 and show that, even with Ben Stokes not on the tour, Australia can be conquered at home.
“You hear a lot about these scars but [the whitewash] was a series which happened four years ago and we’ve won four of the last five Ashes,” Root said. “We’ve got a lot of guys who have very fond memories of 2015. I don’t know whether they are just trying to brush that under the carpet but for me it’s completely irrelevant what happened four years ago.”
Asked if Steve Smith’s side were perhaps trying to convince themselves more than anything, given they were toppled by South Africa at home last year and sit No5 in the rankings to England’s No3, Root admitted it was possible, while noting that only three of the current squad were part of the 2013-14 team.
It was Nathan Lyon, Australia’s off-spinner then and now, who chimed up at the start of the week by claiming England were scared of Mitchell Johnson four years ago and though the left-arm quick has now retired, a repeat could be inflicted by the similarly pacy Mitchell Starc and Pat Cummins. Careers, Lyon said, could once again be ended.
Root, who played grade cricket with Lyon in Adelaide in 2010-11, while England were beating Australia 3-1 that southern summer, responded: “It is a bit bizarre. I think you can sort of see through it a little as well. The more guys talk, the more they put pressure on themselves.”
Nevertheless, Root conceded the Gabba will be intimidating for the six members of his expected side who have yet to play Test cricket in Australia, given the home side’s 28-match unbeaten record there. The away support will be more dispersed among the 40,000-strong crowd too. The key, he said, is to feed off the nerves and be excited by the challenge.
Though Root stopped short of naming his team, the return to fitness of Jake Ball after an ankle sprain means it seems to be settled. One small tweak being considered is for Moeen Ali to bat at No6 ahead of Jonny Bairstow, whose 99 against South Africa at Old Trafford in the summer showed his prowess at shepherding the tail.
Australia have one doubt after David Warner could barely bat in practice on Tuesday owing to a cricked neck suffered when taking a high catch on the outfield. The opener still kept to his pre-arranged media appearance and along with being optimistic about his own fitness, offered some thoughts on the well-documented absence of Stokes.
Warner said: “I think it’s probably disappointing for the England team and the country. He’s let a lot of people down. I would have loved for him to be out here because I know what a competitor he is on the field. At the end of the day, he knows he’s made a mistake and it’s about him getting that respect back from his players and fellow countrymen.”
A return for Stokes at some stage during the series has been mooted in certain sections of the Australian press, something seemingly fuelled by his recent re-emergence on social media, but it ultimately still hinges on the outcome of police investigations into September’s incident in Bristol and England’s disciplinary process thereafter.
On how England will cope in the meantime, and most likely for the entire series, Root said: “It’s very difficult to replace him, so I think it’s more important the guys bring the best version of themselves out there. It’s an opportunity for everyone to step up and do special things like Ben can. We’re all capable, so this week is a chance for someone to go out and do that.”
As Lyon noted in his curious offering, Root was dropped by the end of the last series in Australia and has a gap in an otherwise glowing CV. Asked about this, the 26-year-old replied: “I’m trying to lead a side to do something great – if I score runs it gives us a good chance. But it’s bigger than personal incentives, it’s about coming away with that little urn.”
Ben Stokes, suspended by England pending a police investigation, has re-emerged on social media with two Instagram videos showing him batting and bowling in the nets. Asked about the clips, team-mate Moeen Ali joked: “I sent him a message saying that ball would be hit for six every day. He didn’t get back to me.” As well as demonstrating his fitness after a broken finger, Stokes also took to Twitter in response to Matthew Hayden, the former Australia opener, describing England as a “rabble” with half a team of unknowns. “Hayden says he doesn’t know who half our squad is,” Stokes wrote. “Only 2 from the squad haven’t played at international level... he’s a cricket pundit yeah?”
Mark Wood, the ebullient Durham quick who missed out on an Ashes spot after another summer of injury frustration, was among what seemed a cast of thousands in the Gabba nets on Tuesday as the touring Lions joined in to aid the senior side’s preparations for the first Test. Wood looked sharp in the nets and could push his claims for a recall this series – the pacy wicket at Perth would suit him – when England’s second string take on a Queensland XI in a three-day fixture at Allan Border Field starting on 27 November.
Along with Wood, seamers Saqib Mahmood (Lancashire), Tom Helm (Middlesex), George Garton (Sussex) and Josh Tongue (Worcestershire) also bowled to England’s senior batsmen during the session, with Garton in particular being used to help tune up for the left-arm angle of Mitchell Starc. Jack Leach and Dom Bess (both Somerset) and Amar Virdi (Surrey) all provided a workout against finger spin and had valuable time with Saqlain Mushtaq, the senior side’s specialist consultant.
For Mason Crane, the wrist-spinner in the Ashes squad, this week has seen a reunion with Stuart MacGill. The former leggie, whose Test career was unfortunate to coincide with that of Shane Warne but still returned 208 wickets from 44 caps, is paid to mentor young English county bowlers – currently Delray Delray Rawlins (Sussex), Matt Parkinson (Lancashire) and Matt Critchley (Derbyshire) - during their overseas placements in Sydney grade cricket and was flown up for some work with the Lions. Crane’s rise to prominence owes much to his own time in the scheme last year, where he built up a strong rapport with MacGill and went on to play for New South Wales in the Sheffield Shield.
Usman Khawaja, the Australian No3, apologised on air after calling a local radio host a “wanker” during a live interview when asked about the pressure of maintaining the Test side’s 28-match unbeaten record in Brisbane. The slip was laughed off but as Alastair Cook noted during his press conference, “you wouldn’t want to be the Australian side that does lose at the Gabba”.


Sam Simmonds is poised for a first England start after Nathan Hughes was ruled out of England’s final autumn Test against Samoa on Saturday. Eddie Jones has also omitted the British & Irish Lions Anthony Watson and Jonathan Joseph in a number of changes made to his squad.
Hughes misses out with a bruised knee while Charlie Ewels and Nick Isiekwe will be part of the match-day squad and Alex Lozowski is expected to feature, having been retained in the 25-man squad. Simmonds, 23, has made brief cameo appearances off the bench in both autumn Tests so far but with Hughes out for up to a month and Sam Underhill due to be rested, he is set to line up against Samoa.
Neither Watson nor Joseph are injured but Jones has Mike Brown – who took a full part in training on Tuesday – available again after a head injury while Lozowski, who missed out against Australia after an eye-catching cameo against Argentina, is pushing for a start.
Lozowski may replace his Saracens team-mate Owen Farrell – a peripheral figure in training – in the No12 jersey with George Ford potentially continuing at fly-half and Henry Slade slotting in at outside-centre in place of Joseph. If that is the case, it would be the same 10-12-13 combination fielded by Jones in the first Test against Argentina over the summer.
“For a first go over in Argentina, it wasn’t too bad for a first outing together. George and Henry are both very creative and unbelievably talented players so it was a joy to play with them,” said Lozowski. “Hopefully we can do the same this weekend. We will try and gel nicely and then take confidence from the way we have trained and hopefully create some opportunities at the weekend.”
Brown’s return to fitness is a boost for Jones, who has taken the opportunity to rest Watson – a starter all three British & Irish Lions Tests in New Zealand. In the forwards, both Ewels and Isiekwe will be named in the matchday 23, along with Joe Launchbury but George Kruis is again sent back to Saracens. Maro Itoje and Chris Robshaw appear favourites to be Jones’s selected flankers. Courtney Lawes is also an option either at lock or back row.
With Jones naming three loosehead props, one of Mako Vunipola, Joe Marler and Ellis Genge will make way on Thursday, while the other to be omitted is set to be one of Farrell, Slade, Lozowski or Piers Francis – another who is retained for the first time this autumn – when Jones names his starting XV.
The indications, however, are that Lozowski will make the cut. “Every time you get a chance to play it is a massive opportunity,” he added. “You are in a fortunate position to be playing for England so you have to give it your all because you don’t know when the next game will come along.”
England have won all seven previous meetings with Samoa, who were defeated by Romania last weekend and are currently 16th in the world rankings. As a result, England are expected to win handsomely but earlier this week Jones warned that “traditionally Samoans have always wanted to hit hard”.
Lozowski however, is relishing a physical contest. “I do enjoy it. It is a hugely important part of the game,” he said. “I am preparing to hit hard and hit well because if you can get in those good dominant tackles you can slow down the speed of ball and hopefully get your defence on the front foot.”
Full squad: Mike Brown (Harlequins), Elliot Daly (Wasps), Jonny May (Leicester), Semesa Rokoduguni (Bath), Danny Care (Harlequins), Owen Farrell (Saracens), George Ford (Leicester), Piers Francis (Northampton), Alex Lozowski (Saracens), Henry Slade (Exeter), Ben Youngs (Leicester), Charlie Ewels (Bath), Nick Isiekwe (Saracens), Maro Itoje (Saracens), Joe Launchbury (Wasps), Courtney Lawes (Northampton), Chris Robshaw (Harlequins), Sam Simmonds (Exeter), Dan Cole (Leicester), Ellis Genge (Leicester), Jamie George (Saracens), Dylan Hartley (Northampton), Joe Marler (Harlequins), Mako Vunipola (Saracens), Harry Williams (Exeter).


When the time comes to pull the names out of the hat at Uefa headquarters next month, none of the second-placed teams will want to draw Tottenham Hotspur. There is no longer evidence of any inferiority complex when they rub shoulders with Europe’s elite and they will fancy themselves against anyone after winning Group H – at the expense of the mighty Real Madrid, no less – with a game to spare after this mature, resilient victory away to Borussia Dortmund.
Their reward is a relaxing evening when they host Apoel Nicosia at Wembley next month and, more importantly, playing the second leg of their last-16 tie at home. Behind to Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang’s fine goal, Tottenham rallied in the second half to end Dortmund’s slim hopes of snatching second from Madrid, with Harry Kane scoring his sixth goal in five games, Son Heung-min applying a super finishing touch and Dele Alli producing an unselfish display. For Dortmund, exiting the Champions League was tough to take. Peter Bosz’s beleaguered side visit Madrid, who destroyed Apoel, in their final match and are not even sure of finishing third, but they could not complain. Tottenham were superior.“It was difficult because Real Madrid and Borussia Dortmund and Apoel are always difficult but we try to enjoy and be competitive and try to win, that was the idea in every single game,” said Mauricio Pochettino afterwards. “I am happy for the result, to be top of the table, first, but we’re looking forward to playing the next game.”
As Tottenham set off in pursuit of the result that would increase their chances of a favourable draw in the last 16, a year since defeat in Monaco brought a premature end to their interest in this competition for another campaign, it was worth taking a moment to reflect on the brutal manner in which Dortmund devoured them in the Europa League two seasons ago. Tottenham have come a long way since those days, back when they seemed to shrink in the company of the silkiest continental sides, and securing their progress from this most daunting of groups with that enchanting victory over Madrid three weeks ago meant that they began with a sense of freedom at one of European football’s most iconic venues.
However it was also a mark of Tottenham’s tougher mentality that it was difficult to detect any weaknesses in their line-up, three days after the bruising experience of losing the north London derby. Mauricio Pochettino was unwilling to accept any loss of momentum, even though the stakes were lower than might have been anticipated when the groups were drawn, while he knew that Dortmund were not to be taken lightly despite the mess the Germans have made of their qualification attempts.
Two draws with Apoel meant that Dortmund’s hopes of progression were already hanging by a thread by the time news filtered through that Madrid were hammering the lowly Cypriots, and perhaps that explained the muted celebrations that greeted Aubameyang’s glorious opener after 30 minutes.
The goal was a reminder of Dortmund’s class, the Gabon striker drilling a low shot past Hugo Lloris after being released by a stunning flick from the impressive Andriy Yarmolenko, but it was a bittersweet moment, too. Bosz, who is under intense pressure after a dreadful run that has seen them slip from the Bundesliga summit to fifth place, stayed in his seat on the bench, his expression impossible to read.
Aubameyang, who was back in the side after being dropped for disciplinary reasons at the weekend, hardly looked delighted, even though the striker was a constant thorn in the side of Tottenham’s back three. The sense of what might have been hung over Dortmund.
Yarmolenko was elusive in the hole, impudently creating an early chance that Aubameyang scuffed wide, but Tottenham also enjoyed themselves at times. Pochettino made four changes from the defeat to Arsenal, bringing in Danny Rose, Serge Aurier, Harry Winks and Son Heung-min, whose movement threatened to expose Dortmund’s risky high line, and Roman Burki had to make excellent saves to deny Christian Eriksen and Eric Dier before half-time.
Despite trailing, Tottenham felt confident of prising open an unconvincing defence and it did not come as a surprise when they equalised three minutes after the break. Dortmund’s self-destructive tendencies were encapsulated when Jeremy Toljan’s indecision allowed Rose to divert the ball to Dele Alli, who quickly shuffled it on to Harry Kane.
The striker had been a peripheral presence, but he bullied Dortmund at Wembley in September and his shot, aimed low to Burki’s right from 20 yards, settled Pochettino’s side. Aubameyang faded, Yarmolenko’s influence diminished and the moment Tottenham were waiting for arrived when Alli, showing great determination and skill, bustled past a series of weak challenges and into the area before finding Son, who curled a peach of a shot past Burki.


Jürgen Klopp bristled at the comparison but it was unavoidable. Liverpool owed Sevilla for the 2016 Europa League final defeat, their manager had admitted beforehand, but they were transported back to Basel by another second-half collapse, another night to forget for Alberto Moreno and another three-goal fightback. The debt has increased.
There was no defeat or heartache for Liverpool on this occasion, although this was not a night for consolations. They were in rampant, clinical and formidable form in the first half as two goals from Roberto Firmino and one from Sadio Mané threatened to devastate Sevilla’s 12-month unbeaten home record.
It remains intact thanks to an astonishing recovery and Liverpool crumbling, defensively and offensively, when the pressure was on. Guido Pizarro’s equaliser in the third minute of added time cost Liverpool qualification for the knockout stage of the Champions League as group winners. A point at home to Spartak Moscow next month will suffice. It should not have been necessary.
Pizarro’s close-range finish sparked pandemonium around the raucous stadium. Sevilla’s players and staff cavorted on the pitch. Thousands of luminous wristbands, issued to produce a spectacular light display before kick-off, were thrown from the stands. Klopp simply looked on in disbelief. Seven times he has faced the Spanish side as manager of Mainz, Borussia Dortmund and Liverpool and he has yet to taste victory in any. He may never have a better opportunity.
The blow may prove greater to Liverpool’s self-esteem than their qualification prospects, but the reappearance of a soft underbelly after such an impressive start was galling for the manager. Defensively, they were found wanting again yet it would be remiss to apportion blame solely at the feet of his defenders. The visitors’ bravery on the ball and clinical edge deserted them after the restart.
The substitutes Emre Can and James Milner, introduced to quell the fightback in place of Moreno and Philippe Coutinho, had excellent chances to extend Liverpool’s advantage at 3-2. So, too, Mané. There was an inevitability to Sevilla’s stoppage-time reprieve when they went begging.
Liverpool could not have dreamed of a better start against a strong, experienced but initially nervous home side. Ninety seconds had elapsed when Firmino punctured the defence and the fantastic atmosphere, a considerable feat in itself considering the noise level, by converting Coutinho’s corner at the back post. Georginio Wijnaldum flicked on the delivery and the Brazilian was unmarked as he steered a precise finish into the small gap between the goalkeeper, Sergio Rico, and the woodwork.
Sevilla could have commenced their comeback much earlier but Nolito and Wissam Ben Yedder squandered two excellent chances inside two minutes as Éver Banega’s quality distribution stretched the Liverpool defence. The former Manchester City forward was foiled by a good save from Loris Karius, who tipped his shot on to a post and gathered the rebound, while Ben Yedder scuffed wide when clean through.
The visitors made Sevilla pay almost immediately with a replica of their opening goal. Rico conceded a corner with a save from Firmino after the Brazilian was sent clean through by an excellent ball from Jordan Henderson. His defenders had not learned their lesson. Coutinho swept over another inviting delivery, Firmino won the aerial challenge and, with Gabriel Mercado asleep at the back post, Mané reacted instinctively to steer a diving header back across goal and into the far corner.
Sevilla were staring at humiliation in front of their disbelieving supporters when Liverpool scored a third with 30 minutes played. This time Mané was the provider as he sprinted on to a sumptuous long pass from Moreno over the defender Johannes Geis and forced Rico into a low save to his left. The rebound fell perfectly for Firmino, who had time to control, look away and lash home into an empty net.
Sevilla have conceded 12 goals in 12 La Liga games this season, to put Liverpool’s attacking prowess into context, and their first-half evisceration could have been worse had Mohamed Salah taken another chance.
They exited to a cauldron of disapproval at half-time but re-emerged like men possessed. Playing for pride, and no doubt stung by their manager’s words during the interval, they subjected Liverpool to another second-half ordeal.
Ben Yedder orchestrated the fightback as Moreno, similar to the Europa League final, endured a fraught night against his boyhood club. The striker sent a glancing header beyond Karius from a Banega free-kick needlessly conceded by the Liverpool left-back.
Moreno then presented Sevilla with a penalty by miscontrolling a Coutinho pass and clipping Ben Yedder inside the area as he attempted to make amends. The contact was exaggerated but contact was made. Ben Yedder sent Karius the wrong way from the penalty spot and, having been ordered to retake due to encroaching, sent him the other to set up a nervous finale.
Pizarro, pouncing from close range after Joaquín Correa’s corner flicked off Ragnar Klavan, sealed the remarkable recovery.


Nasser al-Khelaifi, the chairman of a powerful Qatari sports investment company that owns Paris Saint-Germain, was in secretive negotiations to take over a company accused of paying football officials millions of dollars in bribes, a federal court in New York heard on Tuesday.
The claim was made by Santiago Peña, a former financial executive at the Argentinian marketing company Full Play, as part of testimony in the trial of three former South American football officials accused on multiple bribery counts. Peña is a star US government witness in the sprawling investigation into corruption at Fifa, the sport’s governing body. He has laid out detailed evidence that Full Play paid multimillion-dollar bribes to a group of football officials in exchange for the rights to regional competitions and World Cup qualifiers.
During testimony on Tuesday, Peña revealed that al-Khelaifi, referred to only by his first name and “[the] head of soccer club … Paris Saint-Germain” by defence attorneys, was in negotiations with the owners of Full Play, Hugo and Mariano Jinkis, to buy the company out. Both Hugo and Mariano Jinkis – father and son – have been indicted by US prosecutors on corruption charges, but remain in Argentina.
Peña said the deal was kept almost entirely confidential within Full Play and only he, the owners and one other finance executive, were aware of the negotiations. The former executive said that once Full Play’s owners had been indicted in the US government investigation, unveiled after a dramatic raid on a hotel in Zurich in May 2015, the deal was abandoned.
“After 27 May, logically, the potential transaction was ended,” Peña told prosecutors during testimony on Monday. He added that he deleted emails relating to the negotiations shortly after the indictments were announced.
A spokesman for Qatar Sports Investments, the Qatari firm chaired by al-Khelaifi, confirmed to the Guardian that the company had examined acquiring a controlling shareholding in Full Play but decided against it “after closer inspection”.
On Tuesday Peña said the takeover would have seen the Qataris obtain 51% of the company, with an option of a further 19%, for $212m. Executives referred to the deal as “the New York Project” – a reference to the 212 area code in Manhattan and the sum being offered. They had been working on negotiations “for more than one year,” Peña said. He added that under the proposed arrangement Hugo and Mariano Jinkis “would continue to operate the company” after the proposed takeover occurred.
Peña, who worked at Full Play between 2009 and 2015, has implicated Hugo and Mariano Jinkis in a series of multimillion-dollar bribe payments. Key to his evidence has been the disclosure of a ledger the prosecution claims shows records of bribe payments made to a group of South American football officials on the region’s governing body, Conmebol.
Peña said he used codewords, mostly car manufacturers’ names, to denote bribe payments made to each of the officials, including defendants Manuel Burga, the former head of the Peruvian football association and Juan Ángel Napout, the Paraguayan former president of Conmebol, who have pleaded not guilty to multiple counts relating to corruption.
Al-Khelaifi is seen as a leading figure in the Gulf state’s push into the international sports world including hosting the 2022 World Cup, and is also the chairman of prominent broadcaster beIN.
Last month he was accused by Swiss prosecutors of bribing the former Fifa secretary general Jérôme Valcke to purchase broadcast rights to World Cup tournaments.


Chris Smalling has questioned Gareth Southgate’s judgment, saying he was surprised the England manager dropped him from the friendlies against Germany and Brazil for not being accomplished enough at playing from the back.
Smalling also insisted that if he continued to perform successfully for Manchester United, Southgate would be forced to select him for the World Cup.
Of those defenders Southgate chose for his most recent squad, he named Eric Dier, Harry Maguire and John Stones as being “even better” than Smalling at initiating the play. A visibly unhappy Smalling said on Tuesday: “I was surprised. But you don’t play for one of the biggest clubs in the world for as long as I have and win every trophy bar the Champions League without being able to do everything a top defender needs to do, be it playing or defending.”
Since joining United in July 2010 Smalling has won the Premier League twice, the FA Cup, League Cup and Europa League. The centre-back has played every minute of United’s past 10 games, and pointed to his part in José Mourinho’s impressive rearguard.
“This year we’ve got the best defensive record and we have done for the last few years and I’m very proud to be part of that,” he said. “While I’m playing under José, he’s happy and I’m playing regularly, then I’m happy with that.”
Smalling hopes to force his way into Southgate’s squad for Russia 2018. “Ultimately it’s your club form that decides whether you play at a World Cup because there aren’t many England games throughout the season,” he said. “While I’m playing regularly and part of a very successful team, that should show come the summer. If my season carries on like this and we have a successful season and our team continues to concede very few goals, then I give him maybe no choice in the summer but to pick me.
“With United the spotlight is always on and there’s always going to be that pressure, no matter what the game is. Whether it’s the Premier League or the Champions League, I can showcase my abilities.”
Smalling is confident in his abilities. “I don’t really feel like I need to prove anything to Gareth,” he said. “Like I said, I play for one of the most successful managers in José and he’s only going to pick the best players. I’m getting a good run of games these last few months and I’m feeling good.”
Smalling is enjoying working with Mourinho. “As a team and individually we work a lot on our tactics,” he said. “A lot of it is done in the meeting rooms. He’s very in-depth how he analyses the other team and how he wants us to play. It opens up the whole understanding of how you see the game and the more that I’m working with him the more I’m feeling comfortable with him and doing his instructions.”
United play Basel on Wednesday night at St Jakob-Park knowing a point from their fifth Group A match would secure qualification to the Champions League knockout stage. Mourinho is resting Ashley Young, Juan Mata and Antonio Valencia for a game on a pitch recovering from the wear it took during the World Cup play-off between Switzerland and Northern Ireland.
Mourinho, who inspected the St Jakob-Park surface before his press conference, said: “I want to see after 20 minutes of the game – at this moment it looks OK. But at least I respect the effort of trying to make a positive pitch after [it] being so bad in the play-offs in the national team.”
Mourinho again criticised how Phil Jones’s thigh injury was aggravated on England duty. The Football Association’s medics are content they told their counterparts at United of their intention to give the defender a course of injections – he had six – and that no objections were raised.
Mourinho said: “The information from my doctor was that they consult him in relation to Phil Jones with a little problem in the knee when the national team starts working. But then no more contact. The local injections before the match, we were not informed [about].”
Asked if the hope was that Smalling would regain his England berth, Mourinho said: “I hope he doesn’t get his spot because somebody comes [back] injured – was injured.”
Zlatan Ibrahimovic will again be a substitute as he works towards match fitness after a knee injury. “Zlatan goes on the bench and he should come because he needs to play and because he’s useful for us,” Mourinho said.
Romelu Lukaku will avoid the prospect of jail time by compensating police in Los Angeles for their repeated call-outs over loud parties in the summer.
Police said they arrested the Manchester United striker after responding to five noise complaints in as many days at a Beverly Hills residence where he was staying. The parties were held while Lukaku was on the verge of a £75m transfer to the club from Everton.
Lukaku will pay $450 (£340) to reimburse the force as part of a deal that will see the charge reduced from a misdemeanour which could have carried six months in jail, a Los Angeles court was told on Tuesday.
Commissioner Jane Godfrey, overseeing the case, said: “They are reaching a disposition in this case that the first thing that must happen is the defendant must pay Beverly Hills police department $450 for multiple response calls.”
The city will then reduce the charge to a disturbance of the peace infraction, which carries a $100 dollar fine plus other costs and penalties, she said.
As a misdemeanour, the charge would have carried the maximum sentences of six months in county jail or a $1,000 fine, the commissioner added.
James Eckart, for the city, and Lukaku’s lawyer Robert Humphreys accepted the arrangement.
The case will return to court on 18 December when Lukaku’s lawyer is expected to pay the $550 dollars in fines and compensation, a $40 dollar fee as well as other undecided penalties. PA


The decision to leave Borussia Dortmund to join Arsenal was not one Sven Mislintat made in a hurry. This sounds typical of a thoughtful, down-to-earth man who has made his reputation by looking, listening and trying to get a full picture rather than acting on rash instinct.
Structural change has been needed behind the scenes at Arsenal for some time – even since Ivan Gazidis’s call for a “catalyst for change” it has been a slow burn – but the latest person chosen to refresh the setup brings qualities the club hope will make a real difference. Mislintat, described in Arsenal’s official announcement as “one of Europe’s most respected player recruitment experts” and ostensibly coming in to cast a fresh pair of eyes over the scouting philosophy, has a track record in the Bundesliga that was admired across Germany.
Christoph Biermann, a writer with 11 Freunde, who got to know Mislintat during conversations for a book he is writing about the use of data in football, values the way Mislintat brings together current and traditional modes of assessing football. “He is very interested in modern ideas generated with stats and data but he is also strong when it comes to scouting with the human eye,” Biermann says. “At Borussia Dortmund he worked with a wide range of scouts with different backgrounds. He would listen to the modern guys, and the older guys with more traditional values, to get the complete picture.”
Mislintat’s background, as an amateur player who studied sports science in Bochum, led to his interest in analysing matches and he started off at Dortmund in that department. He happened to be at the right place in the right time, when the club were facing bankruptcy in 2005 and so much was up in the air, to be asked to organise the scouting. So he began by learning. He asked the scouts what they looked for, how and why, educating himself about the role.
“It was a strange way into this but Borussia Dortmund at that time was a perfect place to learn,” Biermann says. “They had limited resources. They had to be very clever and careful in their choices.
“If you look at the incredible turnaround, from when the club was almost bankrupt to reaching the Champions League final against Bayern Munich in 2013, four pillars were vital to this. Hans-Joachim Watzke was the organisational force who led the financial reconstruction; Jürgen Klopp transformed the way they played; Michael Zorc as technical director; and the fourth factor was Sven Mislintat, who was so strong in scouting. He possessed a quality for evaluating how well a player would develop in future.”
The best examples include Shinji Kagawa (Mislintat saw his potential when others found it hard to assess in the Japanese second tier), Robert Lewandowski, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Ousmane Dembélé. As Biermann points out, it is not as if the latter group were unknown but predicting those who can evolve into elite players is something Mislintat has a nose for. “We are not talking about unveiling someone nobody has ever heard of,” Biermann says. “But to identify someone as becoming world-class, to forecast a career, is a difficult task. He is really good at that.”
In Mislintat Arsenal have found someone whose qualities echo those Arsène Wenger had when he arrived in England. Wenger’s reputation in 1996 was enhanced by what was a golden era in recruitment. He sent Patrick Vieira as a taster – the midfielder arrived a few weeks before the manager sorted his exit strategy from Grampus Eight in Japan and everybody in the ground for Vieira’s Highbury debut was stunned by the instant impact of a special and very different calibre of midfield player. During the three title-winning sides between 1998 and 2004 there was an extraordinary conveyor belt of talent: Nicolas Anelka, Emmanuel Petit, Marc Overmars, Freddie Ljungberg, Kanu, Thierry Henry, Robert Pires, Gilberto Silva, Kolo Touré, Cesc Fàbregas. Contacts in the French market gave Wenger a fantastic advantage but he added from Sweden, Brazil, Ivory Coast and more, slotting seemingly perfect players into the squad.
Wenger had what David Dein, Arsenal’s vice-chairman at the time and the manager’s close ally, described as “encyclopaedic knowledge” of the markets in the late 1990s and early 2000s. But two major things happened to make it more difficult for Wenger to continue striking gold as he did in that period. First, international scouting and injections of multimillions allowed other clubs to not just catch up but overtake. Second, Dein left Arsenal in abrupt circumstances just over a decade ago, when boardroom manoeuvrings over the potential sale of the old board’s shares to overseas investors led to a fracture. Signing players had been a relatively simple operation – Wenger told Dein he liked a player and Dein made it his business to cut the deal.
Arsenal were left with a vacuum in a critical position at the club. It was not resolved easily. Player recruitment was helped along by Ken Friar, the veteran administrator. A couple of years later Dick Law, an American known to the club from when he assisted negotiations in the transfer of Gilberto Silva, joined the club full time to oversee transfers until he stepped down in September. Meanwhile the scouting department grew in numbers, and Arsenal invested in a data analytics business to try out a sort of Moneyball approach, but making headway in a complicated marketplace brought mixed results. Signings such as André Santos, Yaya Sanogo, Gabriel Paulista and Lucas Pérez never really worked out.
There have been coups – the purchases of Mesut Özil and Alexis Sánchez, no matter what happens in the next few months as their contracts run down, will go down as influential in this era of the club. Wenger’s eye for a class act like Santi Cazorla, an unpolished gem like Laurent Koscielny, or a youngster with potential like Héctor Bellerín, has produced some fine goods.
But there have also been duds, dithering and disappointing transfer windows. Some of the finger-pointing for that goes to the manager himself, for indecision on certain targets or not prioritising some physicality in the heart of defence or midfield. Some goes to the scouting department, and the data analytics gurus, whose recommendations do not always fit the bill. Some is directed at the negotiators, with winding down contracts a related problem. Recruitment has been one of the departments that felt in need of an upgrade for a while.
Persuading Mislintat to join took time. He thought long and hard about it, given his family’s needs and his emotional ties to Borussia Dortmund, the club he supported as a boy from the region he grew up in. Despite conflict with Thomas Tuchel during the latter’s spell as Dortmund manager he remained wedded to the club until now.
Mislintat, along together with the contracts expert recruited from Team Sky, Huss Fahmy, is tasked with reviving Arsenal’s dormant gift for spotting talent.


Everton intend to contest the Football Association’s charge against Oumar Niasse after the Senegal striker became the first Premier League player to be accused of “successful deception of a match official” for an action during the 2-2 draw with Crystal Palace on Saturday.
The law was introduced at the start of the season in response to repeated calls to eliminate diving and may lead to Niasse being handed a two-match suspension after an independent panel decided he was guilty of simulation to win a penalty in the first half at Selhurst Park.
The referee, Anthony Taylor, awarded a spot-kick after deeming Niasse had been fouled by Scott Dann in the fifth minute, with Leighton Baines converting to cancel out Palace’s first-minute opener.
Dann claimed Niasse, who drew Everton level for a second time with a goal on the stroke of half-time, had “conned the referee” but it is understood Everton will appeal any suspension.
“Incidents which suggest a match official has been deceived by an act of simulation are referred to a panel consisting of one ex-match official, one ex-manager and one ex-player,” read an FA statement. “Each panel member will be asked to review all available video footage independently of one another to determine whether they consider it was an offence of ‘successful deception of a match official’. Only in circumstances where the panel are unanimous would the FA issue a charge.”
Niasse, who defended himself following the incident and told the Liverpool Echo he would be “shocked” to be charged, had until 6pm on Tuesday night to respond.
The law was approved at the FA’s annual general meeting in May in an extension of its powers to retrospectively charge players with offences deemed worthy of a ban. In the past, three former match officials have ruled on red-card offences that were missed by the referee but this could become the first in the Premier League to overturn a decision on an incident that was seen by officials.


The two-time NBA champion Ray Allen said he is a victim of catfishing, and has asked a court to throw out a case where he is accused of stalking someone he met online. 
Allen filed an emergency motion in Orange County, Florida, on Tuesday, one day after Bryant Coleman told the court he is being stalked by the 10-time All-Star and two-time NBA champion, who won titles with the Boston Celtics and Miami Heat. Allen said Coleman is the one who is stalking. 
“Coleman pretended to be a number of attractive women interested in Ray Allen,” read the motion filed on Allen’s behalf. “Ray believed he was speaking with these women and communicated with them.” 
Attorney David Oscar Markus released a statement saying Allen took legal action in an effort to put an end to threats against him and his family, and that Allen was the victim “of an online scheme to extract money and embarrass him by someone who appears to be troubled.” 
In the filing, Allen said Coleman threatened to reveal details of their conversations, and that the sides eventually struck a deal to keep everything private. Allen said that deal has been violated and that Coleman has continued to harass him and his family through several social media accounts. 
“He posted about Ray’s wife, Ray’s children, Ray’s dog, Ray’s homes, Ray’s wife’s restaurant, and numerous other personal items,” read the motion. “Coleman not only posted about these things, he would actually post while physically located inside Ray’s wife’s restaurant in Orlando. And he would make sure they knew it, tagging Ray and his wife on those posts.” 
Allen asked the court to stop Coleman from “cyber stalking”. It was not clear if Coleman has an attorney, and a working phone number for him could not be found. 
“Ray regrets ever engaging with this person online and is thankful they never met in person,” Markus said. “This experience has negatively impacted Ray, and he hopes that others might use his mistake to learn the dangers of communicating online with strangers.” 
Allen is the NBA’s all-time leader in three-pointers made. He won championships with Boston in 2008 and Miami in 2013, the second title coming after he made one of the most dramatic shots in playoff history a game-tying three-pointer with 5.2 seconds left in regulation of Game 6 of the finals against San Antonio, a game that the Heat would win in overtime to extend the series to a seventh game.  Allen also played for Milwaukee and Seattle, and last appeared in the league in 2014. He and his family have lived in the Miami area since. 


Thibaut Courtois does not expect discussions to resume over a new contract at Chelsea until the end of the season, when he will be entering the final 12 months of his deal. The previous round of talks in May failed to reach an agreement.
The goalkeeper, who spent three successful years on loan at Atlético Madrid after joining Chelsea from Genk, has been an integral part of the team who have won two Premier League titles in the past three seasons. His agent, Christophe Henrotay, held talks with the champions towards the end of last season, seeking to take the Belgian’s wages closer to the £200,000 a week level enjoyed by Eden Hazard at Stamford Bridge and another of the division’s elite goalkeepers, David de Gea, at Manchester United.
Although Courtois – who kept 16 clean sheets in the league last season – is happy at Chelsea and willing to sign improved terms, he has regularly expressed his fondness for life in La Liga, where his situation continues to be monitored by a number of clubs, notably Real Madrid. His former girlfriend has returned to Spain with the couple’s two children. Chelsea are well aware of interest in him from Spanish clubs and will be anxious to achieve a positive resolution before the player goes into the final year of his deal, potentially damaging his value and their bargaining position.
“The most important thing is to perform well for myself and the team,” said Courtois before the Champions League game against Qarabag. “Regarding my contract, that’s something where Chelsea must deal with my agent. I don’t think there have been any new developments. We have so many games at the moment, and I prefer to focus on the team’s matches, my own performances, and there will be time enough towards the end of the season to have talks.”
Courtois will seek to smooth Chelsea’s progress into the knockout phase with victory in Azerbaijan on Wednesday, with the visitors’ squad having stuck to Greenwich mean time in an attempt to overcome the four-hour time difference with one eye on Saturday’s daunting trip to Liverpool. The players took the six-hour flight on Monday, training in Baku on the eve of the tie, and will make the 2,500-mile return journey immediately after the match. They do not expect to arrive back in London until around 5am.
That has dismayed Antonio Conte, who aired his frustration earlier this season when his team were asked to play Manchester City on the Saturday after the game at Atlético on the Wednesday night. This week’s scenario is arguably more brutal – Liverpool play Sevilla on Tuesday – given the travelling involved, with Conte again asking questions of the Premier League and television companies involved in fixture scheduling.
“I’m a bit surprised because it’s the second time this situation has happened,” he said. “The first time it was the same: when we played on Wednesday away at Atlético Madrid and came back to London at 5am and then, on the Saturday, we played Manchester City, who had played on the Tuesday. Now this. It will be very difficult for us to recover. Whoever prepared the fixtures for the league must pay great attention. I don’t like to find excuses but sometimes I think it’s right to give respect for our job.
“I’d like to underline I’m talking for all the teams who are playing in the Champions League, not just for Chelsea. At this moment, England needs to try to understand this problem and change something. For a lot of time, there hasn’t been an English team playing a final in the Champions League. Why is this? The teams are very strong, and every team has the possibility to go through to the Champions League final. Whoever prepares these fixtures must pay great attention. We are doing our job but we want also a bit of respect for our job.
“We won’t be back until 5am, but then to prepare the game in only one day will be very difficult. But this isn’t the first time. Imagine playing against Manchester City in the same condition? If we’d won the game, the gap would only be three points now. If we’d drawn it, it would be six points. Now it’s nine points. Now there is another big game against Liverpool. So if you ask me if we’re ready to catch up City, whoever prepares the fixtures must change something.”
Conte may seek to rest some players before the game at Anfield and will consider whether N’Golo Kanté, Gary Cahill and Tiémoué Bakayoko are required to start in Baku’s Olympic stadium. “It’s normal to have rotation for the team but I trust all my players,” he said. “I have a squad with great maturity. My players know very well the importance of the game against Qarabag. Don’t forget that Qarabag have drawn twice against Atlético Madrid, and Roma struggled a lot before winning here against them. We have great respect for this team. If someone thinks this game will be easy, it won’t be.”


Vic Marks: Australia – because they usually do. England have won there once in their last seven tours.
Jason Gillespie: Australia will win because I’m not convinced England can take 20 wickets consistently if conditions don’t suit Stuart Broad and Jimmy Anderson.
Ali Martin: Australia to pilfer the urn, with home conditions proving the difference between what are two imperfect teams with near identical win-loss records since the last time they met.
Andy Bull: Australia. Their fast bowlers are just that much more dangerous in these conditions and England’s batsmen haven’t kicked their bad habit of collapsing in a heap.
Geoff Lemon: With both having weaknesses, home advantage will make the difference. If Australia’s bowlers stay fit, they’re too good. Lose two, and things will look different.
Adam Collins: Australia on the simple basis they will win the race to 20 wickets more often. Mitchell Starc, Josh Hazlewood and Pat Cummins make a trio of world-class brutes. The trick: keeping them fit.
VM 3-1. I fancy England’s chances in Adelaide if they bowl at the right time; they usually struggle in Perth. Then they arrive in Sydney 2-1 down with the Ashes still alive for the first time since 1982-3.
JG 3-1. England’s best chance for a Test win is Adelaide under lights, with a draw in Perth or the MCG and Australia to then win in Sydney. Their attack should be too strong.
AM 3-2. Draws seem passe for both teams and with the roulette wheel of a day-night Test too, a fluctuating series is not out of the question. It would be great fun too.
AB 3-2, because I’m an optimist. The day-night match will be a crapshoot and this Australia side aren’t so good that they’ll be able to sweep the other four Tests.
GL 4-1. Small chance of rain, and two sets of fallible batsmen who play in fast forward. So forget the draw but England should jag a win.
AC 3-2. Draws are a thing of your granddaddy’s era. Coupling that with the fragility of both batting lists, expect plenty of golf to be played on the fifth days.
VM Mitchell Starc. He may not be quite as quick as Mitchell Johnson but if everything clicks he is the most dangerous bowler on either side.
JG Josh Hazlewood will be Glenn McGrath-esque in his consistency and I’m looking at him to finish up around the 30-wicket mark.
AM Steve Smith, who has batted on another level at home in recent times. Which superstar captain at No4 is best set up by their top three – or forced to firefight more often – could be key.
AB Josh Hazlewood. Pat Cummins and Mitchell Starc may be faster, but Hazlewood will be the backbone of the attack and probably finish the series as Australia’s leading wicket-taker.
GL Josh Hazlewood. Mitchell Starc is lightning – scary, and never in the same place. The straight man of the attack knows his conditions, hits his length, and will clean up after his strike partner.
AC Since the last time these teams met, David Warner has reconstructed his game to be more suitable for all conditions. “Aggressive defence”, is his new doctrine. He’s also fitter and more focused than ever. Look out.
VM Being proven completely wrong.
JG Seeing the speed gun being pushed over that 150kmh (93mph) mark by Starc and Cummins. I love watching the former when it reverses too, going around and getting those yorkers in – it’s one of the great sights in world cricket.
AM Seeing whether Mitchell Starc ploughs on with the moustache after Movember is up, a la Mitchell Johnson four years ago.
AB The latest instalments of Jimmy Anderson’s late-career masterclass in the art of bowling medium-fast.
GL Steve Smith versus Joe Root: two grand appetites at the cricket buffet, as the young captains face off for the first time.
AC Moeen Ali and Nathan Lyon having more influence than the cynics will insist. That, and the circus when Ben Stokes is inevitably airlifted in. Grab the popcorn.
VM Writing those agonising postmortems if England lose badly. Taking the flak once again.
JG Hearing about this fabled fairytale that is “the spirit of cricket”. I don’t want to hear that term at all!
AM Talk of “psychological scars” or “brand of cricket”. Or “whitewash”.
AB My grudging admiration for David Warner when he inevitably thrashes England’s attack for 150 somewhere along the way.
GL The ECB press release when they rush Ben Stokes over. And the CA press release when they recall Geoff Marsh.
AC Australia’s cringeworthy sledging. They’re a nice bunch of blokes, honest. In turn, they really don’t do the mental disintegration thing very well.
VM “Actually I had a sneaking feeling Vince and Ballance would be our leading runscorers.”
JG This may be a pipedream, but “this series was on par with the 2005 Ashes”. I’d take a narrow win for Australia if it rivalled that.
AM “England comfortably outsung their opponents in the stands.” AM
AB “How good was Ben Stokes’ match-winning century in the fifth Test?”
GL “Why did we agree to put predictions in a newspaper? Ah well. Let’s do it all again at your place.” GL
AC “It wasn’t pretty, but because of that, it was the best damn Ashes scrap on Australian soil for a couple of generations.”


New Zealand have been hit by a second outbreak of mumps on their tour but are confident it has been contained before their final match against Wales on Saturday.
The flanker Ardie Savea is in isolation in the All Blacks’ Cardiff hotel after being diagnosed with the virus despite being vaccinated as a boy. He follows the wing Reiko Ioane, who contracted it earlier on the tour and after recovering, injured a shoulder in the win against Scotland last Saturday.
“Ardie has been in isolation for a few days and must have been in close proximity to Rieko at some point,” said the assistant coach, Ian Foster. “It has caught us on the hop a bit because it is not something that you get a lot of. We are taking it seriously and the doctor reacted really quickly.”
New Zealand will be playing their 15th Test of the year, a run which started against Samoa before the Lions series. They have lost Ioane, Luke Romano, Dane Coles and Jerome Kaino to injury this tour and their captain, Kieran Read, missed training on Tuesday.
“He is pretty battered after the last couple of matches and we took him out of training to give him an extra 24 hours,” Foster said. “He gets through a lot of work and at this stage of the season he is just a bit sore. He has had the chance to freshen up for later in the week.”
Read was criticised by the Scotland assistant coach, Dan McFarland, for a cynical act at Murrayfield that denied the home side a try. “I do not agree with that,” Foster said. “There was a spell when we were put under pressure and were penalised a lot. We infringed more than we would have liked and have to learn from that but Kieran’s record shows he is not cynical. We were not good enough and we have to fix it to take it out of the referee’s hands.
“We have learned a bit about ourselves this tour and we know we face a physical game against Wales. It is about the collision area when you play them.”
Foster knows Warren Gatland well: the pair were in the Waikato side who defeated Wales in 1988 but he was not prepared to comment on his former team-mate’s remarks that the New Zealand media employed underhand methods to try to undermine him during the Lions tour last summer.
“I have not heard or read the comments,” he said. “Gatty is well capable of promoting his own book and I will leave it to him.”
Wales lost their third Lions three-quarter of the season on Tuesday when Liam Williams joined Jonathan Davies and George North on the unavailable list having suffered an abdominal strain during the victory over Georgia.
With Hallam Amos and Steff Evans the likely wings to face the All Blacks, Wales are considering recalling Jamie Roberts in the centre.
“Jamie could come into the equation,” the Wales defence coach, Shaun Edwards, said. “Warren has three or four players to pick from in the centre. If Jamie played he would probably defend at 12, putting him head-to-head with Sonny Bill Williams in a sizeable inside-centre confrontation when New Zealand have the ball.”


Channel Nine last week announced that “Australia’s favourite voices of the summer” would commentate the 2017-18 Ashes series. According to Nine, they are: Bill Lawry, Ian Healy, Michael Slater, Mark Taylor, Ian Chappell, Michael Clarke and Shane Warne (with Michael Vaughan and Kevin Pietersen to appear later to make up the English component of the team). The Englishman Mark Nicholas will anchor.
In case the monotony isn’t evident upon reading, Wide World of Sports helpfully posted a photo on social media of the eight white men in various shades of blue and black suits. Unsurprisingly, the photo went on to draw the ire of an especially acerbic Twitter audience.
Meet our #Ashes commentary team. pic.twitter.com/5OP6KLsqjy
There are a host of highly-qualified, popular women who commentate and have successfully navigated both women’s and men’s cricket. They include, but are not limited to, Mel Jones, Lisa Sthalekar, Alison Mitchell, Charlotte Edwards, Ebony-Jewel Rainford-Brent and Isa Guha.
Jones and Sthalekar are established expert commentators and former Australian cricketers (Sthalekar a former captain), Mitchell is a one-time Sports Journalism Association Broadcaster of the Year, Edwards is a former England women’s cricket captain, commentator and coach with the Adelaide Strikers, and Guha and Rainford-Brent are former English cricketers. Additionally, Rainford-Brent was the first black woman to play for England, while Guha is of Bengali descent, Jones is of West Indian descent and Sthalekar is Indian-born.
In other words, all of these women bring extensive experience in playing and analysing the game, while they are also culturally and ethnically diverse.
Cleverly, Jones and Sthalker have been snapped up by ABC Grandstand, while Guha will represent Triple M, Mitchell BT Sport, ABC and the BBC and Rainford-Brent the BBC. These broadcasters are slowly but surely moving with the times. Even if those arrangements had been made prior to any approach from Nine, Edwards (among others) was likely also available. Some may argue that Channel Nine has only used commentators from the touring side’s home country – Waqar Zaka has, for example, commentated Pakistan Tests and Ian Smith New Zealand’s – but all these women also meet that unspoken policy. Nine is now an outlier persisting with a line-up that is out of touch with public perception .
To put aside for the moment the question of gender, however, it is worth considering how much more diverse the commentary team could be if that unspoken policy was also reviewed. Then, names like the popular Michael Holding (former West Indies player ) or Harsha Bhogle (who has recently returned to the commentary box) might also be considered. At the very least, Holding and Bhogle would provide some international perspective on one of cricket’s oldest and most enthralling rivalries.
Perhaps one of the most disappointing aspects of retaining the same old team is that, together, they churn out what fans have come to expect from white Australian blokes talking sport – a particular brand of middle-aged male banter that has been described as the stuff of “embarrassing dads”.
Yet this isn’t as harmless as an “embarrassing dad”. It’s the stuff that defines the culture of sport in Australia; a space where white men feel entitled to be as offensive and hilarious as they like, since they rarely, if ever, hold each other to account.  And so, since it should never be the job of a minority to hold others to account for their poor behaviour (as Audre Lorde would say), would a woman or non-white commentator want to participate in a white, male dominated line-up anyway?
Take Melbourne sports radio station SEN, for example. On Monday morning, Andy Maher raised the issue on breakfast radio, saying he was “stunned” by the public backlash to WWOS’s photo on Twitter. The panel (with Maher the notable exception) – and subsequent callers – then proceeded to defend Nine’s retention of the same men.
“These guys have been around for a long time and that’s a strength of any commentary team. You’ve got a familiarity and you work well together,” offered Maher, playing devil’s advocate.
But it’s precisely familiarity that is the problem – that’s usually a good sign that various forms of privilege are going unchecked. This is the same radio station that currently boasts  15 white men in its AFL commentary team.
The composition of “expert” panels like these speaks of a clear disconnect between those who are given the platform and professional opportunities to analyse, and those who consume Australian sports. Like AFL, cricket is as obsessively followed by women as it is men. More than one million women say they “almost always” watch Test and ODI cricket on TV. It stands to reason that those same women would like some representation on screen – for the sport they love to reflect the diversity of those who watch and, (thanks to significant improvement in investment in women’s cricket) in increasing numbers play it.
It is incumbent on those who say they support women’s sport to also get serious about providing professional opportunities for women involved in those same sports. This is particularly important to the increased professionalisation of the women’s game, but also to redress the gendered imbalance that pervades Australia’s favourite sports.
Channel Nine has covered the women’s Ashes series – a closely-fought, captivating campaign closed out by the Australians after the first T20 at North Sydney Oval.
So far, the Women’s Ashes has over 4.1 million minutes watched worldwide, over three million video views on social media (with Ellyse Perry’s double century accounting for over a million views alone) and 236,068 broadcast views. These are promising figures given women’s cricket is yet to capture the nation’s attention in the same way as some other women’s sport.
If Nine is serious about growing women’s cricket, then it must capitalise on this interest to also enable the professional endeavours of women who are so passionate and knowledgable about the game. The social media reaction to Nine’s “meet our team” post show that the public is more than ready to listen to diverse voices.


For those in charge of promoting rugby’s core values these are once again uncomfortable times. Take your pick from ranting Test coaches, big games awash with gamesmanship, mounting strain on referees and invasive technology with a depressing sprinkle of premature retirements and concussions on top. It is not a life-enhancing list.
No one wants passionless sport, played in silence and officiated by robots. Equally, it is increasingly clear top-level rugby is less healthy in body and soul than some like to imagine. Even the most uplifting bits – Doddie Weir and his sons taking the ball out at Murrayfield, Scotland’s thrilling effort to topple the All Blacks – are disappearing into the maelstrom, with the investigation of Michael Cheika’s conduct at Twickenham the latest example.
What, precisely, is generating all this angst? Antipathy between certain individuals can be an aggravating factor but it is not the root cause: Cheika and Eddie Jones are former team-mates who go way back, as do Warren Gatland and Steve Hansen’s assistant coach, Ian Foster. Is it entirely coincidental both Jones and Cheika, who will discover his fate on Wednesday have lost their cool this month or are there other forces at work beyond scoreboard pressure? Could it be perfectly simple: the modern game is driving them all crazy?
Take the following scenario. Up goes the kick-off in Cardiff on Saturday, the air still thick with heavenly bread, hakas and hostility. Under it is Dan Biggar, so good aerially, who gets to the ball a split second before the first onrushing All Black. Down he comes like a sack of potatoes, at which point all hell erupts. At least half a dozen Welshmen advise the referee it is a red card offence, while Kieran Read and co argue precisely the opposite. The TMO takes five minutes to make a decision, based as much on how Biggar landed as anything else. Short of a panel of Strictly judges holding up their suggested colour of card, it could scarcely be more of a pantomime. Eventually it is decided a spell in the sin-bin will suffice. Wales kick to touch, win the lineout and move the ball into the midfield.
At the first ruck, Sam Cane piles into Taulupe Faletau at collarbone height before one of the All Black props is deliberately rolled out of the melee and, in the process, twists his knee, forcing him to be carried of. Both coaches, in turn, are caught on TV rolling their eyes and cursing loudly. Two minutes later a Steff Evans “try” is ruled out for a fractional forward pass belatedly flagged up by the TMO following All Black lobbying before the conversion can be taken.
None of this is too fanciful; already the game may have spanned 10 minutes despite three minutes or so of playing time having elapsed. And on it goes: emotional, uber-physical, impossibly slim, sometimes arbitrarily drawn margins. Following the post-match review the referee is found to have had an acceptable game but both coaches are reprimanded for throwing clown noses at each other at the press conference.
It begs a couple of important questions: if there was a less pick-and-mix attitude to policing certain areas of the law book and fewer hairline interpretations, would behavioural patterns improve? And should coaches be punished if they seek to influence referees in the buildup? In football the FA announced as far back as 2009 that managers could not discuss the appointed match official in pre-game press conferences. Few, however, would claim it has stopped players pressuring the referee or their bosses from demonstrating touchline restraint.
Better, perhaps, for World Rugby not to copy football’s example but to reissue rugby’s existing code of conduct in 10-foot high letters. When was the last time you saw a team marched back 10 metres for disrespecting the referee, as was once relatively commonplace? Why not start doing so for any instance of anyone other than a captain attempting to sway the referee or calling for a TMO referral? Or, on the advice of the fourth official, if a coach is repeatedly heard swearing in the stands?
Why, furthermore, are certain laws policed and crucial ones, such as players charging or diving headlong into rucks without binding on first, routinely ignored? Technically the head and shoulders of a player joining a ruck must always be above his or her waist. What about so-called “crocodile” rolls which can cause serious injury and are so often missed at all levels, sevens included? Forward passes, however they are measured, are at epidemic levels, largely because no one can see in real time whether or not a player’s hands are pointing backwards. World Rugby has already commissioned a simplified law book; the need for more clarity has never been greater.
Everyone could start by reacquainting themselves with the code of conduct section which precedes the existing laws. In the first paragraph the game is referred to as “a mass of contradictions” in which it is “perfectly acceptable” to use force to try to win the ball but not “wilfully or maliciously” to inflict injury. “It is the capacity to make this fine distinction, combined with control and discipline, both individual and collective, on which the code of conduct depends,” concludes the key paragraph.
Control, discipline, a game played “both to the letter and the spirit of the laws” with utmost respect for the referee? The solution to rugby’s problems is already there in black and white.
Talking of sad losses to the game, Tom Croft’s abrupt retirement from all rugby at the age of 32 deprives Leicester and England of a top man. For him even to return to the sport after suffering a broken neck in 2012 was remarkable enough; as a back-row athlete with exceptional pace he was arguable ahead of his time.
Stephen Moore, Australia’s redoubtable hooker and erstwhile captain, will also hang up his boots after this week’s Test in Scotland, having played an extraordinary 129 Tests and 177 Super Rugby games. Both deserve the most relaxing Christmas break available.
We all know rugby is primarily about players, not just coaches.
That said, the rivalry between Warren Gatland and Steve Hansen is developing a rare edge. “We’re playing Wales, not Warren Gatland,” muttered Hansen this week. “I’m not really looking forward to seeing him but I am looking forward to playing Wales.” In the aftermath of a Lions tour which generated its share of off-field rancour, a Welsh win in Cardiff really would give the bubbling cauldron a stir.


As fans of lower league clubs will no doubt agree, the struggles of Premier League sides in Big Cup in recent seasons is no laughing matter. National pride has taken a fair few dents on the continent in the five years since Roberto Di Matteo’s Chelsea defied logic by beating Bayern Munich in the final, from Louis van Gaal subbing on Nick Powell for Juan Mata when Manchester United needed a goal in Wolfsburg to Arsenal’s annual last-16 farce, to King Brenny playing the reserves at the Bernabéu and Claudio Bravo pretending to be Leo Messi at the Nou Camp, which has led to a sombre mood up and down the count … hang on a minute! Wipe that smirk off your face! Stop giggling, the lot of you! It isn’t funny! It’s a national tragedy! Ask anyone from Portsmouth or Blackburn or Hartlepool, they’ll tell you how much pain it causes to see the big clubs suffer in Europe. Honestly, some people. No respect.
Not that the haters and traitors have had much to cheer this season, what with Our Brave Big Cup Boys finally realising that their European foes aren’t all they’re made out to be. There have been shellackings for powerhouses Napoli and Atlético Madrid, whoppings of whipping boys Maribor, FC Qarabag and Real Madrid, unceremonious dismissals of the likes of Benfica and Borussia Dortmund, and let’s gloss over what happened to Chelsea in Rome because that doesn’t fit with The Fiver’s narrative. This is indisputably a wonderful state of affairs, and all we’ve needed to get to this point is bundles of television cash, an influx of oil-drenched moolah, the arrival of several top managers, and the staunch patriotic backing of $exually Repressed Morris Dancing Fiver, who never gave up hope of a better future, even when David Moyes unleashed Marouane Fellaini on Pep’s Bayern.
It’s all brought us to the point where tonight is set to be a night of pride for English football. Tottenham can seal top spot in Group H by condemning struggling Bundesliga hipsters Borussia Dortmund to the League of Arsenal, Liverpool can secure their place in the last 16 by becoming the first away side to win at Sevilla since 22 November 2016 and Manchester City can continue their emphatic progress by showing Feyernoord – and, indeed, every other fallen power from a poorer league – that it isn’t 1970 any more. Make no mistake, this is a time of deep joy, and anyone who argues otherwise, suggesting that this is all coming at the expense of variety and sporting fairness, that financial inequality doesn’t seem to matter so much now it isn’t just being implemented by Barcelona, Bayern and Real, will be deemed guilty of treason and subjected to a course of re-education at $exually Repressed Morris Dancing Fiver’s local.

“I came to England and I had never spoken English very well. Some guys said to me ‘if the gaffer comes to the dressing room, say to him ‘Scottish b@stard’, you know like ‘hello Scottish b@stard’.

He smiled because he understood I didn’t speak English very well” – Andrei Kanchelskis lifts the lid on some mid-90s Manchester United dressing room b@ntz.

“So disgruntled Hammers fans have been dialing ‘999’ to complain about their team’s poor form [Monday’s Fiver]? May I suggest that the emergency number that their [flamin’] Australian-based cousins call is somewhat easier to remember: ‘000’ (nil, nil, nil)” – Allastair McGillivray.

Chris Coleman reckons that by sacrificing himself for the doomed Sunderland cause no one can accuse him of putting any more pressure on under-fire Premier League managers. “I’ve seen it before where managers are struggling, managers out of work in directors’ boxes smooching around directors because they’re looking for that job with the guy in the dug-out going through absolute hell,” he blathered. “Not one person can point a finger at me and say: ‘He’s a vulture’.”
And Fraserburgh chief suit Finlay Noble added a refreshing dose of realism to news that his Highland League side had drawn Newc Pope’s O’Rangers in the Scottish Cup. “We are under no illusions about this, we will lose the tie for sure,” he deadpanned.

Derbyshire County Cricket Club has terminated Shiv Thakor’s contract with immediate effect after the cricketer was found guilty of exposing himself to two women.
“The club expects the highest standards of behaviour from all its staff and is opposed to sexual harassment in any form,” Derbyshire stated on their website.
“Following last week’s court decision, the club has reviewed the case and Thakor’s contract has been terminated with immediate effect. The club will make no further comment.”
The 24-year-old was convicted at Southern Derbyshire magistrates’ court last week and is awaiting sentencing on 24 November.
Thakor, who made his first-class debut for Leicestershire in 2011, was granted conditional bail before his sentencing as Derbyshire moved to release him from the county.
A former England under-19 captain, Thakor exposed himself through a “gap” in his jogging bottoms. He was arrested in July after the two offences near Radbourne Lane in Mackworth, Derby, on 12 June and 19 June.
Southern Derbyshire magistrates’ court was told that, during a police interview, he said he had already been “sexually satisfied” by his “16-year-old girlfriend” so he would not have committed the offences. Giving evidence, he also said he has “a tendency” to “rearrange myself”, both at the front and the back.




Mike Ashley wants Amanda Staveley to improve her offer for Newcastle United before he considers accelerating the pace of takeover talks.
A formal, near-£300m bid from Staveley’s Dubai-based financial advisory firm, PCP Capital Partners, lies on the Newcastle owner’s table but adjustments will need to be made and compromises reached before Ashley broadly accepts an offer to buy him out at St James’ Park.
Lawyers acting for Staveley and Ashley are locked in complex negotiations. Should the parties reach an agreement in principle, they would enter into a contract of exclusivity. That would represent the starting gun for a month-long period of formal due diligence during which serious haggling over the final price and a myriad of contractual sale clauses would really get under way.
Staveley’s representatives have conducted a month of preliminary due diligence on Newcastle’s finances after signing a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) with Ashley. PCP Capital Partners was one of five parties to do so but is understood to be the sole remaining credible bidder.
Ashley, after investing £134.4m in buying Newcastle a decade ago and pouring an extra £129m into the club in interest-free loans, had hoped to make a greater profit by selling for a sum somewhat closer to £400m. Although such an ambition looks highly unrealistic in the current market, the sports retail tycoon is anxious to see Staveley improve her offer before agreeing exclusivity. Ashley has been made aware that room for manoeuvre is fairly limited as Staveley’s bid is close to the maximum she is prepared to pay.
Much is believed to hinge on clauses relating to Operation Loom, the HMRC investigation into alleged tax evasion relating to past player transfers involving Newcastle. Staveley is anxious to protect herself against the possibility of future, potentially hefty, club fines if the allegations are founded.
With payments to Ashley likely to be staged in instalments the final sum would also be reduced were the team to be relegated this season. One way of circumventing the impasse would be for Staveley to make a one-off payment in the region of £300m. This is understood to be under consideration.
Against his desire for a significantly higher price, Ashley knows Staveley’s approach represents a rare chance to sell a concern he has been keen to part with for some time. With Rafael Benítez at the helm as manager, Newcastle are an attractive proposition but Ashley is reluctant to support Benítez in the transfer market and, without investment in players, the much coveted, and increasingly frustrated, Spaniard could well resign.
Staveley is keen to work with the former Champions League-winning Liverpool manager and, ideally, wants the takeover completed in time to allow Benítez to invest in desperately needed squad strengthening during the January transfer window.
The 44-year-old Yorkshire-born businesswoman – believed to be backed by investors in not only the Gulf but the Far East and United States – hopes to have reached the point at which an exclusivity arrangement can be signed by the end of this week.
Although the timetable would be tight, that would make a takeover by the New Year just about feasible. An exclusivity deal would also trigger the Premier League subjecting Staveley and PCP Capital Partners to its “fit and proper person test” , a generally month-long examination designed to assess the viability of prospective new club owners.
PCP Capital Partners has access to around £28bn of Middle Eastern wealth and its standing is testament to Staveley’s renown as a deal-maker.
Long known as a facilitator of football takeovers she helped broker the agreement which saw Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed al-Nahyan take control of Manchester City in 2009 and was heavily involved in Dubai International Capital’s attempt to buy Liverpool a year earlier.


The New England Patriots got the result they wanted on their trip to Mexico City on Sunday, beating the Oakland Raiders 33-8. Their coach, however, is in no rush to repeat the experience.
“Players did a great job dealing with all the challenges we had to deal with. I think we’re fortunate there was no volcano eruptions or earthquakes, or anything else while we were down there,” Bill Belichick said in an appearance on WEEI on Monday. “You have two NFL franchises in an area that I don’t know how stable the geological plates that were below us [were], but nothing happened, so that was good.”
Belichick’s fears are odd considering he has never voiced concerns about traveling to play any of the NFL teams in California along the San Andreas Fault, an area prone to earthquakes. The Patriots have also played in Seattle twice in the past 10 years; the city sits close to the volcanic Mount Rainier and it is believed an eruption could affect the city.
Belichick did, however, cite other concerns about the Mexico City trip.
“It’s a long way to go for a game,” Belichick said. “There’s a lot to it in terms of all the logistics of it. They are not used to having a NFL team so you have to go in there and handle a lot of the logistics. It took a lot of manpower, a lot of hours, a lot of energy out of our organization to do that. This week, we’re tired. We are exhausted from the trip. It was a good trip, but it took a lot out of us I think.”
Belichick’s statement was seen as insensitive by some in Mexico after hundreds were killed in earthquakes earlier this year. Poncho Vera of ESPN Mexico accused the Patriots coach of “outrageous ignorance”.
The NFL doesn’t share Belichick’s concerns and has said Mexico City will host a regular season game through until 2021. That will be good news for another member of the Patriots, Tom Brady, who said he had enjoyed the trip.
“To be here and play in a different country and to have everyone cheer for our team, cheer for me and cheer for my team-mates is incredible. Hopefully there’s many more games here,” he said. “It’s a great experience. I’ve never been to Mexico City, but I’m definitely coming back. We stayed in a beautiful hotel, I had a beautiful view in my room. Just a very historic stadium. I know there’s been some really important sporting events here.”
The Patriots lead the AFC East with an 8-2 record after the win over the Raiders. Their next game is against the Miami Dolphins on Sunday.


A short schooling session at Newbury showed Coneygree has left the disasters of Wetherby behind, according to his connections, and the Gold Cup hero of 2015 is now likely to return a week on Saturday. The newly named Ladbrokes Trophy, formerly known as the Hennessy, is the target but the betting market remains to be convinced that it is a good idea and offers 20-1.
“Delighted! That’s what we wanted to see,” said Sara Bradstock, half of the husband-and-wife team who train Coneygree at nearby Letcombe Bassett. “Bassy [David Bass] said he tanked him down to the first. He’s jumped brilliantly.”
Coneygree was pulled up for the first time in his career in last month’s Charlie Hall Chase, when he cut into the heel of a foreleg at an early stage, then dropped back through the field before halfway. “It’s a worry that you’ve frightened them,” Bradstock said.
“So we needed to come to the course and check he wanted to go and do it, and he did. He jumped out of his hands at the second and he measured the third like he does, brilliantly.”
Bradstock also wanted to be reassured the wound would not reopen under pressure. “From what I’ve seen at the moment, there’s nothing, there’s no blood, which is very good,” she said.
The remaining concern is fitness because Coneygree could not be described as hard-fit when he went to Wetherby and Bradstock wanted him to go all the way around so that at least he would be straighter for his next outing. “He had a week off after Wetherby but he’s worked last week, he’s done that today and now he’ll do another couple of bits. I don’t pretend I wouldn’t have been much happier with a race under his belt. But you’re not spoilt for choice with races for him.”
Bradstock “truly believes” that the star of her tiny stable has another big day in him, having been kept out of the winners’ enclosure for a couple of years, but her options are limited after the Newbury race. “We’re thinking the King George would come too quick, unless he suddenly bounces out [after the Ladbroke] much better than he has before.
“I suppose there’s always the possibility of going to Ireland for the Lexus. Or just going to Cheltenham for the trial in January. He’s very fragile and we have to take the view that if he’s well and the ground’s right and everything’s right, we’ll run him. Every step he takes is a worry to me.”
Coneygree was one of 14 horses brought to Newbury by five trainers for a pre-Ladbroke gallops morning, a new event that was opened up to Newbury’s annual members, drawing a crowd of hundreds. “It’s fun,” said Nicky Henderson, who brought three of his best hurdlers.
“Normally, we do it behind closed doors on a Sunday morning but it’s lovely that people want to come and see good horses. It’s not always about having 18 runners in a handicap chase.”
Henderson’s focus was on Buveur D’Air, the reigning champion hurdler, who will be at Newcastle for the Fighting Fifth on the day the Ladbroke is run. Buveur D’Air looked on the burly side and clearly takes a lot of getting fit but travelled like the best horse in a bit of work with Charli Parcs and Divin Bere. “Yes, he’s big now,” the trainer conceded. “He carries plenty of weight and there’s a long way to go but he’s done a hell of a lot of work already.”
Henderson readily admitted to being impressed by Faugheen’s return to action on Sunday and is in no rush to pitch his horse in against that Irish-based rival. “I watched the race with JP [McManus, owner of Buveur D’Air] and we just looked at each other and thought: ’Oh dear, we’ll have to sharpen our pencil a bit.’ But the pencil’s getting sharper.
“I don’t know where Faugheen will go or when we’ll meet. You’d like to think that will be in March. We don’t want to be slamming hell out of each other, practising. We’ve all got to get there. We all know there are going to be elephant traps all over the place. Everything has to go 100% right, all the way.”

To universal relief the phoney war is coming to an end. As Alastair Cook put it: “All the talking is done by Thursday,” though he added that 95% of it passes him by anyway since he somehow seems to survive without being on social media. “But I did see that Luton won 7-0,” he was keen to point out. “Did you all spot that?”
In fact this has been one of the quieter buildups to an Ashes series and, therefore, a tough assignment for those who have been reporting the tour from the start. On Tuesday even David Warner, staring solemnly straight ahead (but only because he had just tweaked his neck) declined to stir the pot. We now know him as “the Reverend” and it sounded as if he was taking his text from the New Testament rather than the Old, even though he was physically incapable of turning the other cheek.
Edited highlights of his sermon include: “I would love [Ben Stokes] to be here. He is a world-class player … He knows he made a mistake … If he comes I wish him well … I wish everyone well.” Somewhere along the line the Warner tongue may have been in his non-turning cheek. There were a few verbal potshots but, these aside, little fire and not much brimstone from Australia’s vice-captain.
However, it has become a bit more heated during the last week. First the Australian selectors surprised everyone and copped some flak from old giants such as Allan Border and Shane Warne for the recalls of Tim Paine and Shaun Marsh.
So that helped a bit. Then, out of the blue, Nathan Lyon came to the rescue. In what seemed like a premeditated onslaught he focused upon how scared the English tourists were four years ago before pointing out that Mitchell Starc and Pat Cummins are faster than Mitchell Johnson ever was in 2013, while Josh Hazlewood is “the best bowler in the world”. That was more like it, though this all left Cook chuckling and seemingly bewildered. “I bumped into Nathan this morning and we had a lovely 10 minutes chatting about our kids and stuff like that.”
Lyon’s was a remarkable interview. Back in the macho days of Jeff Thomson and Dennis Lillee we never heard from Ian Chappell about how scared the Poms were. But in the delicate 21st century Lyon did not hold back in a manner that might easily have antagonised England’s tourists. It is one thing to say that X “can’t cope with the away-swinger” or Y “can’t pick the googly”; it is quite another, and far more provocative, to accuse opponents of being scared. Rightly or wrongly this implies a major character defect, which is deemed to be so much worse than technical incompetence.
Of course there is a grain of truth in what Lyon was saying. Four years ago England were not just undermined but also flustered (I like a euphemism) by the pace of Johnson. For the first time in decades one could sense fear among the batsmen either of being hit, which was the case among the lower order, or of being out of control at the crease which in some ways is even more frightening. That was the experience of Jonathan Trott. This made for a spellbinding spectacle, albeit a macabre one for English fans.
Wittingly or not Lyon has highlighted the critical element of this series: whether England can cope with the first-choice Australian attack. They will be tested by pace at the Gabba and objective observers of Australian cricket (they exist, I promise) confirm that Cummins and Starc can indeed propel the ball faster than Johnson did. Whether this pair will be so intimidating is another matter.
In 2013-14 there was no escape from Johnson. With his skiddy action plus an awkward angle of delivery, England’s finest could not find a way to deal with short balls delivered with such menacing accuracy. Increasingly fretful batsmen could not hook, defend, sway or duck convincingly. It is not necessarily the case that Starc and Cummins can direct their bouncers with the same devastating effect. But it will not take them long to try. Starc will pitch the ball up initially, for he is at his most dangerous when he swings the new ball, but the next port of call for him and Cummins will be to test the tourists with some bouncers. England have been preparing for them. But it is a different proposition at the Gabba in front of 40,000 pairs of hostile eyes than it is in a private net against Mark Ramprakash and his ball thrower.
The onus is on Cook to show the way. “They are good bowlers with good records but they don’t do anything we haven’t seen before‚” he said. “You want to challenge yourself against the best but it doesn’t get any easier. Whoever you are, you always start on nought. That’s why Thursday is so exciting.”
England’s strategy is to exploit the fact that Australia have opted for a four-man attack. They have to keep the Australians in the field a long time, which, as Cook pointed out, can bring its rewards later in the series. Initially this means blunting those pacemen. Then comes a conundrum that centres upon the unlikely provocateur, Lyon. In a four-man attack Lyon may be required to bowl around 25 overs – even on the first day. If he is successfully attacked Steve Smith has nowhere else to turn and the burden on his pacemen increases. But how brave can England be against an Australian spinner, once routinely derided but who is now the seventh highest wicket-taker (with 269) in their history? The gamble on a four-man attack is greater than the recalls of Paine, Marsh or the selection of the debutant, Cameron Bancroft. Even so, Australia begin the match as strong favourites.
At least England arrive in a better frame of mind than the splintered side of 2013. They genuinely seem to be adjusted to the absence of Stokes, unless they are bluffing brilliantly. They have long since decided their best available team and that seems to include Jake Ball rather than Craig Overton now that Ball has made a semi-miraculous recovery after twisting an ankle in Perth. And the weather is obliging. To the disappointment of the Reverend the oppressive humidity that often accompanies Brisbane Tests has been absent and there is the chance of some rain interrupting the drama. So perhaps the Gabba may not be quite the ferocious cauldron of seasons past. However, it is not going to be easy.
Cook pragmatically observed that a draw would be a good start to the tour – before adding hastily that England would be aiming to win. “One day they will lose at the Gabba,” he said though the last time this happened against any opposition Scott (Jason Donovan) and Charlene (Kylie Minogue) were getting married in Neighbours, an episode watched by 20 million in the UK in 1988. An English victory at the Gabba would not attract such a massive audience but would be even more entertaining.

The Czech tennis player Jana Novotná, who has died of cancer aged 49, had a career of consistent success that would have more than satisfied most players, but fell some way short of what she would have achieved had she possessed a much steadier nerve.
In 1998, the year before she retired, Novotná became only the fifth female player to pass the $10m mark in career prize money and in the same year was within reach of being ranked No 1 in the world. As an athlete she was among the best of her era, possessed of consummate skill in the dying and difficult art of serve-and-volley and an ability to deliver a backhand smash that was the envy of her peers. And yet in her 14 years at the top of the women’s game she won only 24 tour singles titles. Even more disappointingly, she reached the last eight in 22 of the 50 grand slam singles events in which she competed but managed to convert that consistency into just one title.
The American player and commentator Pam Shriver, who was a good friend, explained this by saying that Novotná was “as kind as she was athletic”. Others, mostly tennis writers such as myself, put it more brutally: she was a choker. Novotná herself said she hated the idea of choking, preferring instead to say that she “got a little tight”.
Her most famous episode of getting a little tight is now a case study for sports psychologists. It came in the 1993 Wimbledon final when she led Steffi Graf 6-7, 6-1, 4-1, and at 40-30 in the sixth game of the deciding set had a service point for a 5-1 lead over the German. But she double-faulted to announce one of the great Wimbledon meltdowns. Not much more than 10 minutes later Graf had won 7-6, 1-6, 6-4. The Duchess of Kent, trying to console the Czech player at the awards ceremony, said: “Don’t worry, Jana, you’ll be back next year.”
That did it for Novotná – moments later her head was in the crook of the Duchess’s right arm as she cried on the royal shoulder. “I wanted to handle myself well,” she said, “but when she smiled at me I just let go.”
In 1997 Novotná was back in the Wimbledon final against the 16-year-old Swiss player Martina Hingis. Although this time it was excusable that she lost, given that she was suffering from a strained abdominal muscle, she still threw away a one-set lead and a 2-0 advantage in the final set of a 6-2, 3-6, 3-6 defeat. The Duchess of Kent was again on hand, this time, though, in the role of soothsayer rather than trauma therapist. “I told her I’m getting a bit old,” Novotná said, “and she said to me my third time would be lucky.”
And so, by royal decree, it came to pass. A year later Novotná avenged her defeat by Hingis with a straight sets win in the semi-finals and then in the final held firm in a second-set tie break to beat Nathalie Tauziat of France 6-4, 7-6. Even that stern wordsmith Rudyard Kipling would surely have forgiven Novotná her refusal to abide by his stricture, inscribed above the players’ entrance to Centre Court, to treat the twin impostors, triumph and disaster, just the same. She did in fact cry in her moment of triumph but they were very different tears from those that followed her 1993 disaster. By the time she reached the Duchess she was almost composed and the pair clasped hands in joint celebration. “I’m proud of you,” the Duchess said.
At 29 years and nine months, Novotná had become the oldest first-time winner of a women’s singles title since grand slam events first accepted professionals in 1968. It was probably a sign of her vulnerability that it was in partnership with other players that she achieved far greater grand slam success than as a singles player. Set against her solitary singles title was a total of 12 in doubles – four of them with Helena Suková – and four in mixed doubles – with Jim Pugh.
In later years, after retiring in 1999, Novotná became a coach herself and also a member of the BBC’s commentary team at Wimbledon. As on the court, she was a natural in the commentary box without being assertive: it was said that her microphone always needed a boost because she was so softly spoken.
Having lived for some years in Florida in the US, Novotná had returned in 2010 to live near Brno, where she had been born, in communist Czechoslovakia, to František, an engineer, and Libuše, a teacher. Despite her globetrotting she always felt happiest in the Brno area and had recently built a house in the nearby village of Omice, where she lived with her partner, the Polish tennis player Iwona Kuczyńska, who survives her, along with her parents and her brother, Pavol.

It won’t be an easy task but Liverpool know victory in Seville would guarantee them a place in the knockout stages (a draw would suffice if Maribor beat Spartak Moscow in the other game). Sevilla are just one point behind Liverpool in the group and are unbeaten at home in all competitions this season. They have won their last seven matches at the Ramón Sánchez Pizjuán, including a 2-1 victory against Celta Vigo on Saturday evening.
Sevilla’s home form is strong but new manager Eduardo Berizzo has struggled to get the best from a talented bunch of players. They are outside the Champions League places in La Liga, having lost four of their first 12 matches this season. They also suffered an embarrassing 5-1 defeat to Spartak Moscow earlier in the group.
Joaquin Correa was their shining light in their 2-2 draw at Anfield earlier in the group but Liverpool were profligate that night; they mustered 24 shots to Sevilla’s seven and should have taken all three points.
Liverpool are enjoying a decent run of form at the minute – they have won their last four games – and that is largely down to the form of Mohamed Salah. He has had a direct hand in 10 goals (eight goals and two assists) in his last six Liverpool appearances and he is now out on his own as the top scorer in the Premier League. It is just as well given that Roberto Firmino has only scored three goals in the 13 games he has played since these sides met at Anfield in September.
This is a great opportunity for Spurs to move past their disappointing performance in the North London derby and secure top spot in Group G. Winning the group would be an incredible achievement given that they were drawn against reigning champions Real Madrid and recent finalists Borussia Dortmund. Although, in truth, this Dortmund side has gone off the rails this season. With just two points from four games, they are in real danger of finishing bottom of the group and dropping out of Europe altogether.
Peter Bosz was only appointed in the summer but he is already clinging on to his job for dear life. Dortmund have not won in the Bundesliga since September and have earned just one point from their last available 15 – their worst run since they lost five in a row under Jürgen Klopp back in 2014. Their defeat to Stuttgart on Friday was their third in a row and it leaves them fifth in the league, nine points behind Bayern Munich, who have already gone through a change of managers this season.
Harry Kane has been speaking this week about how he wants to spend his “entire career” at Tottenham. That will be music to Mauricio Pochettino’s ears but the manager may want to rest him for his game after he looked off the pace against Arsenal at the weekend. Pochettino may rotate a few of his squad in Germany in the knowledge that a win in their final group game at home to Apoel would be enough to guarantee top spot in the group anyway.
Their goalless draw against Real Madrid on Saturday was not an awful result on paper, but Atlético Madrid – and their city rivals – are now 10 points adrift of Barcelona in La Liga. They are also in real danger of dropping out of the Champions League.
Atlético have lost just once in all competitions this season – when Michy Batshuayi scored a 94th-minute winner for Chelsea at the Wanda Metropolitano – but they haven’t scored more than a single goal in any of their 10 games since that defeat to Chelsea back in September. Diego Simeone’s side cannot find the net. They have drawn 10 of their 17 matches this season, scoring just 19 goals in the process. If that kind of form continues they will be knocked out of the Champions League at the group stage for the first time since 2009, when Chelsea topped their group.
Roma leapfrogged Chelsea at the top of this group when they beat Antonio Conte’s team 3-0 last month. They will have picked up even more confidence from their deserved 2-1 win over Lazio in the Derby della Capitale on Saturday. Life under Eusebio Di Francesco has started very well and they have now won six on the bounce.
With Edin Dzeko having scored as many goals in the Champions League as Antoine Griezmann has managed across all competitions this season (three), Roma go into this game knowing they can dump one of the superpowers of European football out of the competition and book their place in the next round in the process.
Both sides will be confident of progressing to the last-16 stage regardless of the result, but this is still the most glamorous match of the week. Barcelona were comfortable 3-0 winners when they met in September and they go into this fixtures in greater spirits than Juventus, who were beaten 3-2 by Sampdoria at the weekend despite scoring goals in the 91st and 94th minute. Gianluigi Buffon, Alex Sandro and Paulo Dybala sat out that defeat partly because of weariness after the international break and partly because they were looking ahead to this game against Barcelona.
Barça, now playing a 4-4-2 formation with Paco Alcácer and Andrés Iniesta on the flanks, picked a full strength side on Saturday and recorded a routine 3-0 win over Leganés. With a 10-point lead in La Liga, the skepticism surrounding Ernesto Valverde’s appointment and their transfer failings in the summer have been all but forgotten.
All eyes will be on the head-to-head between the two Argentinian No10s. Dybala scored a brace in Turin when these sides met in the quarter-finals last season, but Lionel Messi did the same in their meeting earlier this season. Whichever of them performs best at the Juventus Stadium is likely to be the matchminner on Wednesday.

Matt Ryan and the Atlanta Falcons did enough through three quarters that even the best comeback attempt by Russell Wilson fell short this time.
Ryan threw a pair of touchdown passes, Adrian Clayborn returned a fumble 10 yards for a score and the Falcons watched Blair Walsh’s 52-yard field goal attempt in the final seconds fall short, holding off the Seattle Seahawks for a 34-31 win on Monday night.
Atlanta won their second straight to stay on the heels of New Orleans and Carolina in the NFC South, and handed Seattle a second consecutive home loss. “What an absolute team win from the guys tonight,” Atlanta coach Dan Quinn said. “Coming here, in this environment, with the crowd, we thought it would be two competitive, tough teams that were going to battle for it in the biggest way.”
Ryan threw TDs to Mohamed Sanu and Levine Toilolo, while Tevin Coleman added a one-yard TD run on Atlanta’s opening possession. But it was Clayborn’s fumble return that helped break the game open early in the second quarter and gave Atlanta a 21-7 lead. He scooped up a loose ball after Wilson was crunched by Takk McKinley and Courtney Upshaw. “I think we’re moving in the right direction. We keep proving we can finish games and beat guys. We have to take the momentum and keep rolling with it,” Clayborn said.
With Seattle down 11 points, Wilson hit Doug Baldwin on a 29-yard TD with three minutes left and then threw to Jimmy Graham for the two-point conversion. Seattle got the ball back and moved in range for Walsh, whose attempt was on line but landed short of the crossbar. “That was in our range, and in hindsight I would have just driven it more,” Walsh said. “I would have driven it more and not left it short. I was too accurate and didn’t have enough on it.”
Wilson again was the entirety of Seattle’s offense, throwing for 258 yards and two touchdowns, and running for another 86 yards and a TD. But it was an awful night for the Seahawks, filled with more injuries and questionable decisions by coach Pete Carroll. He called for a fake field goal late in the first half rather than attempting a 35-yard kick. He also made a questionable challenge in the fourth quarter that didn’t go his way and left Seattle with just one timeout.
That lack of timeouts came back to haunt Seattle on the final drive when seconds ticked away and rather than running one more play, Walsh was sent out to attempt the 52-yard kick. His long for the season is 49 yards. The conclusion only amplified Carroll’s baffling decision at the end of the first half, when Seattle ran a fake field goal rather than having Walsh attempt a 35-yarder that would have pulled Seattle within 24-20. Holder Jon Ryan completed his shovel pass to Luke Willson, but Grady Jarrett read the play and tackled Willson for a four-yard loss.
Willson said Atlanta’s defense on the play was different than what Seattle had seen on film. “It would have been a really good call if we had made it,” Carroll said. “Terrific opportunity right where we wanted it and the defensive tackle made a better play.”
Seattle played a game for the first time since the end of the 2010 season without Richard Sherman. His streak of 99 consecutive starts in the regular season was snapped because of a torn Achilles tendon suffered against Arizona. The Seahawks were also without safety Kam Chancellor because of a neck injury, leaving their vaunted secondary with several new faces.
“Those two are phenomenal players ... It was a lot different,” Sanu said. “They did a lot of different things but we just had to take advantage of our routes.”


Name: The Pool Deck.
Age: One year.
Appearance: Pool decky.
What is a pool deck? It’s a pool, usually above ground, with a deck around it.
I see. So, like a paddling pool for grownups? Yes. With a deck around it.
Sounds nice. Why are we talking about these as we stare down the barrel of the supposed coldest UK winter for seven years? Because this particular pool deck is not in the UK. It is in Australia. Specifically, in the Gabba cricket ground in Brisbane, where it was installed last year to encourage people to come to watch matches. This week, it is to be used during an Ashes match for the first time.
I would not be encouraged to go anywhere by the sight of people in a pool. Have you seen people? In a pool? Ah, but these people are different. Aspiring users are required to turn up in their most fetching swimwear and will be chosen at random thereafter by spotters in the crowd.
That sounds more than a little weird and disturbing. Will these spotters be drawn from the full panoply of human sexuality, ethnicity and religious affiliation? Will they seek to represent the same broad range of human forms, personalities and possibilities in their choices? Yes.
Really? No.
So it is just a way of getting bikini babes into cricket grounds? Yes.
Myriad ideological and sociocultural issues aside, will this not be distracting for players? Former England cricket captains David Gower and Mike Gatting say not.
I remember them! The dandelion-haired one and the big bloke? Yes. However, the writer and cricketer Simon Hughes reckons they could be a distraction. “But it could also prove a nice contrast to the awful abuse you get on the boundary. It would put you in a better mood,” he says.
Poor Simon. I know.
What do the Australians say? That they haven’t lost a test match at what they call the Gabbattoir since 1988 and – bikinis or no bikinis – they don’t intend to start now.
No bikinis sounds like even more of a challenge. Let’s leave it there.
Do say: “I am totally focused on the match.”
Don’t say: “I’m going to need a bigger box.”


Mauricio Pochettino didn’t miss a thing.
“He’s one of the very best out there and I have no problem saying that,” Brad Friedel said last week as he settled into his new role as head coach of MLS’s New England Revolution. “His attention to detail and what I was able to see and learn from him, was priceless. The best way to describe it is, yes, he knows the tactics that he wants to play, and yes he knows how to implement them in training, but it’s all the extracurriculars around being a head coach that he manages himself, his staff, and all around him so well.
“I’m not surprised he’s doing so well, and the players have a bigger value than when he came into the changing room. I expect him to be a very good coach for a very long time.”
Friedel is now sitting in the manager’s chair himself after agreeing to take over at the Revolution. The 46-year-old spent four years at White Hart Lane, and it was there that his coaching career began. Tottenham was the final chapter of Friedel’s playing career, one that spanned three decades and contained a number of coaching influences, including Graeme Souness and Mark Hughes.
“When you go into head coaching you have to be your own guy,” Friedel said. “You have to learn how to deal with things – like those above you, those around you – and Graeme would deal with those issues head on. He had zero fear. I’m not saying my personality is the exact same, but when I look back on his career, you got to see how he navigated it. I’m going to do things like myself, but it’s interesting to see how all the head coaches dealt with things.
“Mark Hughes was the same. They were two totally different types of coach though. Graeme used very few analytics, Mark came in and used analytics a lot. People can debate what is right and wrong, but it’s two very different styles.”
Friedel looks back fondly on those memories. Unfortunately, not all of his former employers have thrived like Tottenham. Blackburn Rovers sit in England’s third tier, while Aston Villa are navigating the Championship. Friedel admits it is tough to watch them struggle.
“While I was at the club [Blackburn], it was a wonderfully run football club with the Walker Trust running it,” he said. “I thought they did an impeccable job with running the club, and putting a really good product on the field. When I left, I can’t really comment on what’s happened, but I’m very sad to see what has happened. Aston Villa, a lot of the same. I thought Randy Lerner and Paul Faulkner were excellent people to deal with. While I was at Aston Villa it was a very well run football club, and I’m very sad to see where they are now because they’re an enormous club and they shouldn’t be in the Championship.”
Having spent time at well-run football clubs, Friedel is acutely aware of how influential those above him can be. That’s also what convinced him that the Revolution was the right role for him.
“I think there’s a large amount of trust between [the general manager] Mike Burns and myself,” Friedel said. “I don’t see there being any reason why there won’t be a great amount of trust between [the owners] Robert and Jonathan Kraft and myself. That is a huge part of the reason why I came here.
“In saying that, I’m under no illusion that if my staff and myself don’t do our job the owners will act accordingly. The fact Mike and I were friends was irrelevant in the hiring, but his honesty and integrity was a huge factor, and I’m sure he’d say the same about myself.”
Quite how Friedel’s side will look is still unclear. The American has a little over four months to shape his team, and impart his ideas. He’s unwilling to shackle himself to one identity though.
“I’m not the type of guy that’s going to talk about x’s and o’s right now,” he said. “It’ll be there for people to see. The team will be 100% committed to how we want to play, and our staff will be 100% committed to that, and I will be 100% committed to the club.”
In many ways, that is what makes Friedel such an intriguing proposition. He talks extensively about being his own man, but he’s not willing to articulate what that represents. He could bring the swagger and youth of Pochettino’s Spurs, just as much as he could bring the stoic, and at times, abrasive nature of Souness and Hughes.
When he talks, you occasionally see a glimpse of the latter. He refused to be drawn on the debate over standing for the national anthem, or the state of the US national team. “We’re here to talk about New England,” he said, when asked about his country’s absence from the World Cup in 2018.
It seems, at least for Friedel, his talking will be done on the pitch. He has until March to prepare for his first audition as a senior coach. Whether he’ll succeed or fail remains to be seen, but it looks like being a fascinating watch regardless.


There was extra-time and a late all-in brawl, but Sydney FC beat Adelaide United in the FFA Cup final 2-1 to clinch the coveted domestic treble.
Miloš Ninković opened the scoring and Nikola Mileusnic levelled with the first away goal in the Cup’s short final history, before Bobô finally separated the sides in the 111th minute.
Late drama overshadowed an enthralling affair in front of 13,452 at Allianz Stadium, when Adelaide’s Michael Marrone pushed a ball boy and feisty Sydney substitute Matt Simon reacted, sparking a mass melee involving both coaches and eventually the police.
On the pitch, Graham Arnold’s men convincingly added a third trophy to their A-League premiers’ plate and championship in arguably their best performance of the season.
For all that, Adelaide had the first chance of a scrappy opening when Ryan Kitto latched onto Nikola Mileusnic’s cross and took a point-blank stab. A desperate Alex Wilkinson evoked the last-ditch slide but it was Andrew Redmayne who got his body in front of it just in time.
Then Sydney took charge. Their period of dominance yielded a goal in the 19th minute when Bobô fed to Alex Brosque and the skipper, on an intelligent run to the left, rolled the ball to the feet of Ninković.
Surrounded by Red shirts, the Johnny Warren medallist took a touch with his left foot, shifted the ball to his right to divert a sliding Marrone, and slotted past Paul Izzo.
Not 10 minutes later Ninković was down and receiving treatment for an apparent calf injury, finally returning to play but visibly hindered until David Carney relieved him on the hour mark.
That the Serb still managed a remarkable pass to put Brosque through in Adelaide’s box was evidence of how much he would be missed for the remainder of the contest.
By that time, the Reds had steadied the ship and entered Sydney’s area with increasing regularity. Though they rarely threatened once there, Redmayne could count himself lucky Ben Garuccio’s free-kick clattered flush into the upright.
The goalkeeper was clearly beaten and frozen to the spot, but managed to regain composure in time to collect the Reds’ follow-up.
There was nothing he could do about Adelaide’s equaliser. Ersan Gulum released Mileusnic on the right, the winger drawing in Michael Zullo before cutting inside to curl the ball around Redmayne into the top left-hand corner.
Sydney should have had their winner and more but for Izzo’s late heroics, saving a Bobô header at point-blank range and then denying the Brazilian striker again two minutes later.
Despite a late Sky Blues penalty appeal when the ball struck Marrone’s arm in the box, the contest wasn’t done in 90 minutes. The Reds came agonisingly close to an extra-time winner, Matmour missing a sitter and substitute Mark Ochieng skying another with the goal and a first away Cup triumph beckoning.
But Bobô struck, and by the time Marrone was red-carded for manhandling the ball boy the match belonged to Sydney.


Through the most daring of hands, Danni Wyatt steered England to the least likely of wins, the visitors ending their Ashes campaign by knocking off the highest successful run chase in the history of women’s Twenty20 internationals. In turn, Heather Knight’s side head home having levelled the overall series at 8-8 after winning the last two rubbers.
When England lost three wickets in five overs to begin their response to 178 for two they looked to have given up any realistic chance. The game had a familiar look: the required run rate would rocket as wickets fell. It had all the symptoms of a shocker to never be spoken of again, save for Beth Mooney’s relentless century earlier on.
That almost certainly would have come to pass if not for Australia’s incompetence, dropping Wyatt and Knight four times in total. Awful, inexplicable drops. But batting with the liberty of the reprieved, the pair instead went on to mount an exhilarating and match-winning 139-run partnership in only 75 balls. In the space of an hour, a stinker became a classic.
For Wyatt’s part it was her maiden international hundred, coming only four days after her first half-century for England. It was raised in 56 balls and on 13 occasions the Staffordshire native went through the Australia field, and twice cleared the rope. Footwork and placement defined the knock, which only got better as the chase got deeper. She was fearless in the middle then in shock after play. “It’s a bit surreal,” she said. “I still can’t believe what’s happened. I was just focused on the ball really. I kept telling myself: ‘Focus.’ Then I looked at the board and I was 95. I was, like, ‘Trev [Knight], what’s going on?’”
Knight was perfect in support, getting Wyatt on strike as often as possible before working up the gears herself, the two getting the ask down to a run a ball with four overs to go. The captain’s half-century was enough to also win her the player of the series award. “It was a really special night,” she said. “I knew the girls would fight hard, we just needed someone to go big and Danni did exactly that. I was perfectly happy to play second fiddle to her, and the way she was striking it. Some of the shots, I had to pick my jaw up off the floor. I thought they had too many [runs] but there is a hell of a lot of fight in this team and to level at 8-8 makes me really proud.”
It never looked viable when Mooney played the most superlative white-ball innings of the series. The 117 unbeaten runs she tallied in 70 balls were faultless and sit second on the list of highest scores made by a woman in the shortest form. By any measure, she deserved to be on the winning team.
Her 17 boundaries and one six tell one story, but this was no slog. Rather, it was a far more precise exercise from the left-hander. After lacing the first delivery of the night past point, Mooney went on to scoop, sweep and pull every ball directed at her body with impeccable balance.
When driving, she did so both conventionally and inside-out with equal ease and ample footwork. Four boundaries from the final four balls, delivered by Anya Shrubsole, emphasised her mastery.
But somehow, on this night, it would not be enough. If looking to apportion blame, the opener need look no further than Alyssa Healy. The wicketkeeper, who has had a fine series with the bat and gloves, dropped both Wyatt and Knight to the most straightforward skied chances. Megan Schutt and Molly Strano put down catches off Knight that were just as bad.
“The word bittersweet was used and that’s a pretty good description,” the Australia coach, Matthew Mott, said of his side winning the main but giving up the T20s so spectacularly.
“It’s just a shame for Beth, who played the innings of her life and just made such a great statement for the group. We can’t hide from the fact we dropped four catches and that freed them up to go pretty hard, and Danni Wyatt’s innings was absolutely outstanding.”
As for Mooney, she said she wasn’t sure “whether to laugh or cry” after the game.
Fair enough. But what she proved, Wyatt too, is that missing the ODI series was no handbrake on dominating the T20s. With a global tournament on the cards a year from now, both now know they can win games for their country.


Back in 1949 John Arlott tried to work out exactly why the Ashes feels so much more special than England’s other Test series. He decided that it was not just that the rivalry had been running so long, or that Australia had so often been the better team, but because of their attitude towards the sport. “Australianism,” Arlott called it, “the single-minded determination to win – to win within the laws but, if necessary, to the last limit within them.”
Australianism, he explained, means that “where the impossible is within the realms of what the human body can do, there are Australians who believe they can do it”, that their “team have never lost a Test match until the last run is scored or wicket taken”.
Arlott was laying it on a little thick. But then, when it comes to the Ashes, there is hardly a cricket writer who does not. And the better part of a century later there is still a kernel of truth in what he wrote. Ashes series are different. Every cricket fan in England will feel a little flush of childish excitement when thinking that the first Test starts tomorrow night.
Much as the sport has changed since Arlott’s day, and even though the conditions in the subcontinent are so unfamiliar, and the sporting culture there so foreign, the English still see the Ashes trip as the hardest tour a player can go on. It is where their players go to measure themselves.
Australia, land of hard pitches, harrowingly quick bowlers, hostile crowds, is an English cricketer’s New York. If they can make it there, they can make it anywhere. The late actor Leo McKern, who spent the idle hours of his Sydney childhood at the SCG, reckoned that for the Australians “licking the Poms is a national ambition” and a lot of their press still relish a good roast of the England team. One of the early stories of this tour was the Herald Sun’s helpful guide to England’s official squad photo, published with the caption: “Did anyone nearby wearing a suit get invited to be part?” Because the obvious weakness in this England side is that so many of them are still wet behind the ears in Test cricket.
Four of them – Mason Crane, Craig Overton, Ben Foakes and Tom Curran – have not even made their debuts yet, and another couple, Dawid Malan and Mark Stoneman, did so only this year. Altogether 10 of the 17 men England picked have never played a Test in Australia before, including a couple of the older hands, like Moeen Ali and Chris Woakes. On the face of it, then, it seems that at least six of England’s likely XI will get their first taste of Test cricket in Australia when play starts at the Gabba on Thursday. At least, unlike some of the England teams who have travelled in the past, they will not be carrying too many scars.
When Arlott was writing, tours ran on so long that this would not have been such a problem, since players had plenty of time to get used to the place before the first Test match started. As recently as 1994-95 England played three one‑day games and four first‑class matches before the series began. By the time that side got to Brisbane, they had already faced, and been battered by, a lot of the players who would thrash them again in that week’s Test. But tours are shorter now and England’s warm-up for this Test has been three anaemic practice matches on slow pitches against second XIs.
Look a little closer at those 10 players, though, and you find they are not quite so green as they appear. If tours are shorter now, the world is smaller, too, and there are more opportunities to play abroad. Eight of that group have played some kind of cricket in Australia before. Most obviously Moeen and Woakes have both played for England there in limited overs internationals.
But beyond that Stoneman, Crane, Foakes and James Vince have all had spells playing grade cricket. And Overton, like Foakes, has been on tour there before with the England Lions squad. Vince, too, did that and also played for the Sydney Thunder in the Big Bash. So the country, its cricket and culture, are not going to be so very unfamiliar to them after all. Malan and Curran are the only two who are completely new to it.
This matters. As David Gower recently explained when he was talking about his first Test series in Australia, in 1978-79: “It wasn’t the first time I’d played cricket in Australia because I had one season of club cricket with Perth behind me. That season introduced me to the Australian psyche, which was invaluable; in four months I learnt a lot about the atmosphere, the rivalry and the amount of sledging that I could expect in an Ashes series in Australia. The first couple of State games we played on that 78-79 tour reinforced what an important experience that was.”
English players often do struggle on their first Australian tours. Joe Root was averaging 54 in the Tests he played before his first tour there but had been dropped by the end of the series. Likewise Alastair Cook was averaging 52 before his first Australian tour but could manage only 27 in that 2006-07 series. But neither Root nor Cook had ever played a shot in Australia until they first arrived there with England.
Compare that with Stoneman, who has spent seven seasons in Sydney grade cricket – so long that, if he does well, there will no doubt be one or two Aussies who put it all down to what they taught him at Bankstown. All that experience will not necessarily be too much help when Pat Cummins fires down that first bouncer at his head but at least the Australianisms will not catch him by surprise.

Last week Manchester City and Chelsea secured their places in the Champions League quarter-finals. Both sides won in style over the two legs, Chelsea beating Rosengard 4-0 overall and City gaining their last-eight place with a 7-1 aggregate score against LSK Kvinner.
These were no mean feats. Rosengard are Champions League quarter-final stalwarts, having made the last eight seven seasons running. The Swedish side were runners-up in the 2017 Damallsvenskan (Swedish league) to the quarter-finalists Linkopings for the second year in a row.
LSK Kvinner won the Toppserien (the Norwegian women’s top division) title in emphatic style, finishing 11 points clear of their nearest rivals Avaldsnes, who won the Norwegian cup final with a 1-0 win over Valerenga on Saturday.
It is no surprise that the success of Scandinavian sides in Europe has reflected the health of their domestic women’s leagues over the years, though not to the same extent as the dominant French and Germans, and the same may well be true for England in due course.
For decades women’s football was neglected here and Arsenal, pioneering the game practically alone, achieved success in Europe despite the weakness of the league at home. As they invested and developed, their performances in Europe showed remarkable progress. Six quarter-final exits and five semi-final defeats sandwiched a historic trophy in 2006-07, when they completed an unprecedented quadruple. The Scot Julie Fleeting scored nine times, including two hat-tricks, on their way to the top of European football and Alex Scott scored the winner in the 1-0 aggregate victory over the Swedish side Umea in the two-legged final.
Not until the 2013-14 season, when Birmingham reached the semi-finals, was there a true measure of the changes taking place domestically. The women’s game on a stronger footing has attracted greater numbers of men’s professional clubs to run and invest in women’s teams and the league here has remarkably quickly become as strong as those mentioned on the continent. And last season Manchester City endorsed this when they, too, reached the semi-finals before bowing out to the eventual winners, Lyon, their 1-0 win in the second leg not enough to overturn a 3-1 home defeat in the first.
It’s this context that makes the progress of City and Chelsea so impressive. The turn of their clubs to women’s football has transformed the domestic game. Arsenal have been kept out of the competition they have been more successful in than any other English side since the 2013-14 season, with Birmingham, Bristol Academy (now Bristol City) and Liverpool, and now Chelsea and City, all helping to push the Gunners out of the top two in the league and thus the Champions League spots.
Now the Blues of Manchester and London go into the hat for Friday’s draw with Lyon, Barcelona, Linkopings, Montpellier, Slavia Prague and the two-time champions Wolfsburg not just as cannon fodder but as serious contenders. The switch to a winter league will have undoubtedly aided this progress. With previous domestic seasons being played from March to September/October, English teams were launching their European campaigns as the season was drawing to a close, playing the latter stages post-season. Now they can build momentum during their league campaigns, maintain their fitness and test their squad depth.
England is not the only country benefiting from domestic investment. Wolfsburg and Lyon will still be favourites to claim the crown they have won in six of the past seven seasons between them (Wolfsburg in 2013 and 2014, Lyon in 2011, 2012, 2016, 2017). Meanwhile, Barcelona are reaping the rewards of a strong summer of signings marking the club’s intentions in the long term – Toni Duggan, recruited from Manchester City, their top scorer in the Champions League so far and Euro 2017 Golden Ball-winner Lieke Martens just two of their impressive haul.
With the quarter-finals scheduled for 21-22 and 28-29 March the two English sides will be forced to focus on their league form before they can dream of progression to the latter stages of the Champions League. But no matter how tough their next test may be, Arsenal have shown it can be done and, if experience can guide one of them to the top, it may be Chelsea. Five of their squad, including the captain, Katie Chapman, and vice-captain, Gilly Flaherty, were part of that all-conquering Gunners side.
• Chelsea have signed the Sweden international Jonna Andersson from Linkopings. The 24-year-old defender, who can play at left-back or wing-back will join up with the Blues when the transfer window opens on 29 December. In her nine years at Linkopings she has won three league titles and three league cups.
• LSK Kvinner’s Guro Reiten was named player of the year and midfielder of the year in the Toppserien end-of-season awards. LSK, who ran away with the league, also saw their coach, Hege Riise, win coach of the year.
• Denmark women have been handed a four-year suspended ban from Uefa competitions and the FA fined £1,871 following the cancellation of the team’s World Cup qualifying game against Sweden on 20 October. The national team resorted to strike action as a dispute with the Danish FA over pay and conditions escalated. Sweden were handed a 3-0 win as a result of the action.
• The BBC’s annual Price of Football study has found that, while the Women’s Super League had the highest price increases across all ticket categories, it still remains the cheapest league to watch in Britain. The average season-ticket price rose 23% in WSL 1 and WSL 2, while match-day tickets ranged from £4 to £10.
• West Ham have announced three new signings as they look to strengthen their team having applied for a WSL licence. The former London Bees, Arsenal and Chelsea midfielder Andria Georgiou has joined the club along with the University of Kentucky striker Zoe Swift (who scored on her Hammers debut against Coventry) and Ellie Zoepfl, who also joins from the US.
• The NWSL has announced the immediate dissolution of the two-time NWSL champions FC Kansas City. The long-term future of the club has been in doubt for some time following a fallout with the Likens brothers, who owned the side, and the takeover by Elam Baer in January failed to steady the ship. The NWSL has had the franchise sold back to it and has announced that the Major League Soccer club Real Salt Lake will have the remnants of Kansas City (draft picks, player contracts etc) transferred to it.


The theory of collective intelligence is well-established. The “wisdom of the crowd” principle states that the averaged answer of a group of individuals outweighs that of a single expert on matters of spatial awareness, quantity estimation and general knowledge. It was first mooted by Aristotle, and has been continued by philosophers, statisticians and economists pretty much ever since. It is one good reason why juries and panels exist.
Without offending Aristotle, the Marquis de Condorcet and Francis Galton, Michael Laudrup’s lack of international recognition erodes confidence in the principle. Between 1989 and 1996, Denmark’s greatest ever player was European football’s finest footballer. Not only did European journalists fail to award Laudrup with France Football’s Ballon D’Or; he never even made the top three. That is an absolute travesty and Pep Guardiola agrees: “I just can’t believe he hasn’t won the title as best player in the world.”
Laudrup was not just an attacking midfielder capable of playing anywhere across the pitch, he was a total footballer who peaked under the tutelage of Johan Cruyff and his Barcelona vision. He was perhaps the most elegant European player of all time. After Cruyff, of course.
First named Denmark’s Player of the Year at the age of 18, Laudrup moved to Juventus from Brondby in 1983 but was famously close to joining Liverpool instead. “I think Liverpool at that time were one of the top three teams in Europe,” Laudrup recalls. “So they thought that this young Dane would call them back and say ‘of course I will come’ but I didn’t – and two weeks later I signed for Juventus.”
Laudrup’s time in Italy wasn’t entirely successful. Serie A’s foreigner rule meant he was loaned to Lazio for two seasons (without his prior knowledge), and Laudrup suffered regular injuries in his final three seasons there. In 1989 he joined Cruyff’s Dream Team and became one of the pillars of Barcelona’s unprecedented run of success. In a five-year spell at Camp Nou, he won four league titles, a Copa del Rey, two Spanish Super Cups, the Uefa Super Cup and the European Cup.
When Laudrup announced that he was leaving Barcelona after falling out with Cruyff – who left him out of the European Cup final team in 1994 – Guardiola was reportedly so upset by the news that he cried and begged Laudrup to change his mind, telling him he had learned everything about football from his friend and team-mate.
Joining Barcelona’s rivals Real Madrid, Laudrup was immediately influential in wrestling the La Liga title back from Catalonia. Despite playing only 62 league games for Real, in 2002 Laudrup was voted the 12th best player in the club’s history. In 1999 he was awarded the title of Spanish football’s best foreign player of the last 25 years; take that Cruyff, Hugo Sánchez, Hristo Stoichkov, Ronaldo, Bernd Schuster, Rivaldo and Luís Figo. No other player is loved on both sides of the clásico divide quite like Laudrup, despite memorably causing 5-0 defeats for both clubs in consecutive seasons either side of his move.
There is a doozy of an anecdote from Laudrup’s time in Madrid, which involves him eating in a fancy restaurant in the city in 1996. Laudrup was enjoying dinner with a friend and discussing retiring from football and leaving Spain. Sat a couple of tables away was King Juan Carlos I. Having overheard the conversation, Spain’s King wandered over. “That’s good news,” he said in Laudrup’s ear. “I’ll be the only King in Madrid again.” Truly the royal seal of approval.
If that is the general framework of Laudrup’s career, it is in the minutiae that joy can most easily be found. It is a bold shout, but there may have been no better exponent of passing and dribbling in harmony. He was certainly the best of his generation.
In the modern game, dribbling is a skill usually performed – and certainly enjoyed – when at pace. Slaloming attacking players weave through a defence with dropped shoulders and quick nudges of the ball from one side to another; Lionel Messi is the most high-profile example. Yet Laudrup mastered the art in a very different style. This was the power of the dribble without sprinting, but through variation and pure technique.
In slowing down the dribble, Laudrup lost the ability to surge away from his man. Instead, he relied upon timing. Like a matador with a bull, a magician with a trick or a comedian with a perfectly written joke, Laudrup would lure the defender into a false sense of hope that they could predict the eventual outcome and thus avoid being made to feel foolish. Laudrup would open up his body to stand face on and show his opponent the ball, but the moment they committed to the tackle he would flick it from their reach. The film The Prestige focuses on the three stages of an illusionist’s trick: the pledge, the turn and the prestige. Laudrup could do all three with a football in the space of two seconds. It had a devastating effect.
Next came the passes, less an afterthought and more the crowning glory. Laudrup had an astonishing ability to play the ball with perfect accuracy with any part of his boot and at any point during his stride. First-time flicks, raking cross-field passes, backheels, left-footed crosses to the back post, right-footed crosses to the front post and the type of through balls that some players make once a year and then dine out on for the other 364 days. Importantly, that ability made it almost impossible to know when Laudrup’s passes were coming and thus made him uncontrollable from a defensive point of view. When Laudrup left Barcelona, Stoichkov said that he was envious of every pass that Iván Zamorano at Real Madrid received.
The foundation for Laudrup’s passing and dribbling was a vision that verged on the superhuman. Real coach Jorge Valdano remarked how “he has eyes everywhere”, while Zamorano joked that his team-mates used to say that Laudrup had three eyes.
There is a video on YouTube that collates all of Laudrup’s best passes that is 83 minutes long yet never gets boring. Instead, you are transfixed by the many shades of brilliance. A fun game to play with that video is to press pause two seconds into each clip and try to guess which player will receive Laudrup’s pass and the route the ball will take. Despite seeing the picture in freeze-frame and from above, you’ll struggle to get more than half right. His no-look passes alone deserve their own place in a footballing hall of fame.
So why did Laudrup not receive the recognition his talents warranted? Certainly not due to a lack of respect from his peers, judging by the list of those who consider him one of the game’s elite. “I fully understand why he is considered one of the best players in Barcelona’s history and even the world,” says Messi. “Who is the best player in history? Laudrup,” says Andrés Iniesta. “When Michael plays it is like a dream, a magic illusion and no one in the world comes anywhere near his level,” said Cruyff.
Both Romário and Raúl described Laudrup as the best player they had ever played with. A non-exhaustive list of those to enjoy such a privilege includes Bebeto, Ronaldo, Ronald Koeman, Stoichkov, Gheorghe Hagi, Ronaldinho, Rivaldo, Davor Suker, Clarence Seedorf, Figo, Zinedine Zidane, Cristiano Ronaldo, Xavi, Iniesta, Luis Enrique and Guardiola.
Perhaps Laudrup suffered for his selflessness, his reputation as a gentleman footballer and his contentment to play the perfect supporting role for some of the world’s greatest strikers. As Michel Platini once said: “Michael had everything except for one thing: he wasn’t selfish enough.”
Or maybe, as his mentor Cruyff believed, Laudrup was simply comfortable with football as artform, as an aesthetic pursuit. A player for whom the difficult comes so incredibly easy can easily draw a reputation for laziness, however unfair that may be.
“Had Michael been born in a poor ghetto in Brazil or Argentina with the ball being his only way out of poverty he would today be recognised as the biggest genius of the game ever,” Cruyff said. “He had all the abilities to reach it but lacked this ghetto instinct, which could have driven him there.”
Even if Cruyff was right, that is no reason to diminish Laudrup’s magnificence. Every great team is comprised of both streetfighters and artists, and it is Laudrup’s enigmatic grace that made him so popular. Laudrup made football look more beautiful and more graceful than anyone since the great Dutch master; he was Cruyff’s crown prince. Sorry Jordi.
Slightly surprisingly, the perfect place to end is with former Swansea defender Alan Tate. When Tate told a radio station in August 2012 that Laudrup was still the best player in Swansea training at the age of 48, the presenters laughed. Yet rather than laugh with them, Tate was unmoved; it wasn’t joke. Fourteen years after retiring, Laudrup’s majesty had finally dropped to the talent of mere mortals. For the best part of a decade he played on a higher plane, where only the angels and Johan Cruyff tread.

After the notorious ‘wardrobe malfunction’ of 2004’s Super Bowl half-time show, Janet Jackson’s career was decimated, while Justin Timberlake walked off whistling. With the latter recently confirmed for 2018’s ceremony, how might a possible reunion between the pop idols work?
In a scenario that strives for equality, Janet performs a Bucks Fizz-style trews-removal move on Timberlake, whose slacks fly across the stadium by drone while his penis and scrotum billow in the breeze.
As a social experiment, Justin and Janet recreate the 2004 performance move for move, to test how far media standards have progressed. To be repeated every 14 years.
Timberlake stands motionless in a foam nipple outfit while Houston’s NRG Stadium boos and chants “shame”.
Chris Martin, inevitably, takes the role of on-stage couples’ counsellor, encouraging both parties to work through their trust issues. Featuring an unexplained appearance by Wiz Khalifa.
Justin introduces – it couldn’t be! It might be! IT IS! – his special guest, Janet Jackson. But the platform rising from below the stage is totally empty, and we all learn a very important lesson about loyalty.


In among the heady speculation at Jessica Harrington’s yard about what Sizing John might do this season, there was a moment of realism yesterday. It came when the trainer stated her baseline ambition for the horse.
“I’d like to get him back to the Gold Cup because the last two Gold Cup winners haven’t even got back. That’s Plan A, to get him there.  Whatever happens after that will be a bonus.”
Harrington is right about this. Neither Coneygree nor Don Cossack made it back to the Gold Cup the year after winning it. This is part of being a top-class staying chaser, in my view; in most cases, you only get a year at the top. Winning a race like that comes at a cost, which can be that the winner is either unwilling or incapable of a reprise.
“My only worry,” Harrington continued, “is maybe the three hard races last year might leave a mark on him. But he’d had a good few hard races the year before and he seemed to come out of it very well.”
Sizing John is only seven, rising eight, and he looked a picture yesterday. I have high hopes for him.
To Southwell for some jump racing, where Pretty Reckless (12.30) is the nap. This is a rarity, a four-year-old filly being campaigned over fences as her trainer, Dan Skelton, makes best use of her fluent jumping. 
She hasn’t won by wide margins in her two successes since Harry Skelton returned to her saddle in September but she gives the distinct impression of more to come. She’s a half-sister to Heath Hunter (who won from 20lb higher) and is 2-1 to go in again today.
At a more generous 12-1, Whin Park (1.30) may be worth chancing in a handicap hurdle, just his second attempt in a handicap. From the excellent Ben Pauling yard that had a double on Sunday, he put up a fine performance on his seasonal return here last month but ultimately needed the run and tired into fourth. An improved showing here puts him right in the argument.
Windy Writer (3.00) is an interesting 10-1 on his second start for Sam England, who has proved effective in handicaps. Four of his five best runs have been at this track and he went well for a long way on his seasonal reappearance last month. If he’s sharper this time or benefits from the fitting of a tongue tie, he can get into this, having been dropped 5lb for his latest defeat. He was previously with Shaun Lycett, who went winless through the last season he had the horse.

Poor Tony Pulis. The former West Bromwich Albion manager had barely cleared his locker of chewing gum and club shop caps before a line of potential successors started forming at the Hawthorns. Right at the front, jostling to get a closer look at Claudio Yacob, is Derek McInnes. The Aberdeen manager has been linked with Rangers but used to captain West Brom, scoring this banger in the Battle of Bramall Lane.
Behind him, Nigel Pearson is acting as bouncer, keeping Alan Pardew, Sam Allardyce and both Martin and Michael O’Neill at arm’s length. But who’s this sneaking in at the back? Disgraced former Everton manager Ronald Koeman?! As if that wasn’t shameful enough, Pulis could be bundled straight down the M5/M4 to Swansea City, stopping for gum and hats at Magor services, if Paul Clement gets the boot.
Chris Coleman’s first transfer moves at Sunderland will come as a surprise to absolutely no one. The former Wales manager is targeting former charges Danny Ward and Ben Woodburn, both at Liverpool, presumably before lining up Gareth Bale, Vinny Jones, Neville Southall and Shadwell. Liverpool can replenish their Welsh contingent by beating Spurs to Sheffield United’s silky playmaker David Brooks.
Staying on Merseyside, Jürgen Klopp has offered a firm nein danke to moving Daniel Sturridge moving on in January. “It’s a story, but actually I am not really interested in stories,” said Jürgen Klopp, who probably shouldn’t waste his time with this next one. Across town, a new contender has emerged in the race to become Everton manager, with odds tumbling on – you’ll like this – Louis van Gaal!
German giants Schalke are back, baby – up to second in the Bundesliga, they’re fixing to bring local boy Mesut Özil back from Arsenal. Özil was born in Gelsenkirchen and began his career at the club, and the chairman, Clemens Tönnies, has said the playmaker’s return “would be a nice story”. It’d be a shame if someone – Manchester United’s José Mourinho, for example – came along and ruined it.
Claudio Ranieri is back working his magic with Nantes in Ligue 1, but has one twinkly eye on the Italy job. Ranieri, who was sacked by Greece after losing to the Faroe Islands, has said managing his country would be “special and beautiful”. Antonio Conte was the name at the top of Carlo Tavecchio’s list, but the former head of the Italian FA has resigned, his list torn angrily into little pieces.
Finally, a feel good story – Tony Yeboah is alive and well! The former Leeds crossbar-botherer went on Ghanaian radio to rubbish online rumours that he had died. “Those people behind these stories must stop this,” said Yeboah. “You don’t have to use social media for such vices.” Sound advice, Tone.


Paralympian athlete Anne Wafula Strike has won a financial settlement from CrossCountry trains after she was forced to wet herself on a rail journey because the accessible toilet was not working.
The athlete and campaigner welcomed the settlement and the rail company’s efforts to improve services for disabled travellers but said there were still a lot of changes required before transport could be considered truly accessible for all.
“I can’t describe this settlement as a victory. It will be a true victory when what happened to me no longer happens to any disabled traveller any more,” said Wafula Strike. “I was on a train on 13 August this year when I found that the accessible toilet was broken. Fortunately I did not need to use it on that occasion but what about other disabled passengers on that train who might have needed to use the toilet urgently?”
The Guardian revealed earlier this year that Wafula Strike was travelling from Nuneaton to Stansted on 8 December 2016 when she discovered that the accessible toilet was out of order. Her entire journey from Coventry to her home in Harlow was several hours and she was forced to urinate on herself, a situation which left her acutely distressed and humiliated.

The train company apologised and have now made a confidential compensation payment.
Wafula Strike’s solicitor Sue Willman, at Deighton Pierce Glynn, welcomed the settlement but said more needed to be done to truly improve travel for disabled people: “Disabled people like Anne who have suffered degrading treatment when travelling contact my firm all the time. It is important that Anne has made a stand and that train operators are starting to take their legal duties to disabled people more seriously. But I think we need the rail minister to introduce legal sanctions, not just encouragement, to really see a difference.”
Alongside the financial settlement, Wafula Strike has agreed to enter into dialogue with groups representing disabled transport users.
The Department for Transport has drawn up a draft accessibility action plan and is consulting on how access can be improved. The consultation ends on Wednesday and Wafula Strike urged as many disabled travellers as possible to respond.
The draft action plan includes calls to improve the quality and availability of information on accessible toilets at stations and on trains, highlighting the need for better training for transport staff of the requirements of people with disabilities. It also suggests taking steps to address the challenges facing people with disabilities when seeking spontaneous travel.
Paul Maynard, the parliamentary undersecretary for rail, accessibility and HS2, said people with disabilities had the same right to travel independently as anyone else and he was committed to delivering a transport system that worked for everyone.
Wafula Strike said she would be donating some of the money she received to a disability charity and using the rest to continue to campaign for truly accessible travel for people with disabilities.
A spokesperson for CrossCountry said: “We are pleased to have reached an agreement with Mrs Wafula Strike after her experience when travelling with us last December. Since then, we have undertaken a thorough review of our processes, new accessibility training, enhanced maintenance for toilets and other arrangement to help all our customers.
“While we have apologised for the events that day, a lot of good has also resulted from this, with the whole rail industry looking at ways to make Britain’s railways a more accessible environment.”


David Warner has accused Ben Stokes of letting England down through his Ashes absence. But the Australian opener has also seen his own participation in Thursday’s first Test thrown into doubt after suffering a neck injury during the host nation’s penultimate training session.
Warner, so important to Steve Smith’s team given his aggressive approach at the top of the order, suffered the knock when taking a high catch in practice at the Gabba and then aborted his subsequent net after just two balls when unable to get properly aligned at the crease.
But it did not stop the Australian vice-captain appearing for his scheduled media appearance after the home side completed their workout, where he decided to play a few shots on the subject of Stokes and the late night incident in Bristol two months ago.
The issue has dominated the lead-up the series locally, with curious rumours abounding in the Australian press that the all-rounder will indeed join the series at some stage, something seemingly fuelled by his recent re-emergence on social media but ultimately still hinging on the outcome of police investigations and England’s own disciplinary process.
Clearly hampered by his stiff neck, but determined to engage on the subject, Warner said: “I think it’s probably disappointing for the England team and the country. He’s let a lot of people down. I would have loved for him to be out here because I know what a competitor he is on the field.
“It’s obviously up to the English police first, with punishment or no punishment. At the end of the day, he knows he’s made a mistake and it’s about him getting that respect back from his players and fellow countrymen.”
Warner, who missed the first two Tests of the 2013 in England after a late night fight of his own, went on to say he wished Stokes well should he feature at some stage, couching his earlier assessment with words of respect about the all-rounder’s fiery nature and all-round prowess.
On his own fitness, the left-hander hoped 24 hours of intense physiotherapy and heat treatment would allow him to bat in the nets on Wednesday before taking his place at the top of the Australian order alongside debutant Cameron Bancroft.
England’s own injury doubt – Jake Ball – trained in full on Tuesday after suffering a sprained ankle during the second warm-up match, with team-mate Moeen Ali effectively confirming the Nottinghamshire seamer’s inclusion in the side when he spoke to the assembled media.
Asked whether the issue of Stokes has been a distraction for the England, not least since the all-rounder has begun posting videos of his training at Durham on Instagram in the past week, Moeen replied: “It’s exciting that he’s back batting and bowling. There’s every chance he won’t be here at all. If he comes it would be a massive bonus for all of us. We don’t see it as a distraction.”


The AFL commission has voted to retain the traditional centre bounce, despite increasing calls from umpires to have it scrapped. AFL chairman Richard Goyder and football operations manager Steve Hocking said the bounce was a “unique” and “iconic” part of the game, speculating that fans would be happy with the decision. Goyder also snuffed out any suggestion that the decision was a short-term one, adding emphatically: “the bounce is here to stay”.
Ray Chamberlain, who has umpired 264 games in 13 seasons, had been the umpires’ unofficial spokesperson on the issue, calling the bounce his “kryptonite” and claiming that colleagues had been treated with medication for anxiety because of the pressure of bouncing during matches. Eleni Glouftsis told Guardian Australia earlier this year that the bounce was causing umpires a number of physical problems, including shoulder reconstructions and back injuries. She said the original purpose of the bounce had been its unpredictability, whereas in recent times, umpires had been under increasing pressure to bounce straight and predictably.
The AFL’s umpires seemed privately confident of the league axing the bounce. Umpires’ Association CEO Peter Howe recently said it was only a matter of time until the AFL would eliminate it. He added that if the bounce remained, “we would need to chat with the AFL about the impact on the health and wellbeing of umpires”.
On Tuesday, however, Hocking made clear that bouncing was a requirement of an umpire’s job. “From our point of view, if you want to be an AFL umpire, this is part of being an AFL umpire... if you’re going to find your way through you need to practice that,” he said.
Umpires throw the ball up at stoppages, a rule that was introduced in 2013, but will continue to be required to perform centre bounces. Hocking said the AFL would, however, support umpires through the change.
“If people are wondering how important the umpires are from my point of view, their particular department is the 19th team of the competition. They need further support and on-going care and I’m absolutely committed, as is the organisation [to providing that].”
Earlier on Tuesday, Gillon McLachlan made headlines by suggesting that a mid-year trade period would create a more equal competition. “I would like to see it,” he said. “It’s one of the only times where you have the weaker clubs, i.e. the club lower down the ladder, having more leverage in the trade.”
McLachlan said the concept made sense for clubs who were hit hard with unlucky injuries – and could help them make ground on the rest of the competition sooner. “It’s four, five or six years for a club to get in the position to be competing deep into the finals,” he said.
“You might get the wrong couple of injuries, and you need a player. [A mid-year trade period would provide] the ability to pick up a key defender or ruckman.”
McLachlan said people were averse to the idea because “there’s an emotive side to the trade, but there’s no difference to [it happening] at the end of the year”. He said players were generally resistant to moving clubs, but the trade period showed that there was an appetite for player movement.
“Players are incredibly loyal. We get to the end of the trade period and people are bemoaning the lack of trades and player movement. If anything, I think there needs to be more player movement.”
He added that it was clubs, rather than fans, who had been the most resistant to the concept. “No-one likes change generally,” he said. “Our clubs like it as little as anyone. [But] I think we’ll get there.”
The league is also currently considering the prospect of live trading of picks during the draft, likely to be introduced next year.


The Republic of Ireland defender Cyrus Christie has revealed that he has received racist abuse on Twitter following his country’s failure to qualify for the World Cup. In a statement posted on social mediaChristie highlighted “a number of racist comments” and said those responsible “do not belong in football or any other sport”.
James McClean drew attention to the issue while speaking at the PFA Ireland awards on Saturday, and the Football Association of Ireland has now referred a number of posts aimed at the defender to police in Ireland. PFA Ireland and the charity Show Racism the Red Card (SRTRC) issued a joint statement on Monday night, condemning the abuse and referencing a tweet which they claim “urged him to go to Jamaica and boasted about wanting to lynch him”.
“I’d like to say I am extremely proud to represent my country, the Republic of Ireland, and I give everything I can each time I put on the green shirt,” Christie said in his statement. “I genuinely believe our fans are some of the best in the world.
“However, there have been a number of racist comments which have been brought to my attention during the World Cup qualifying campaign over the last couple of months and, most recently, last week,” he added.
“These comments are not representative of our fans or our sport. We were all deeply upset to not reach the World Cup finals and are hurting just as much as everyone else. It is deeply saddening that racism is still part of the game we all enjoy and love. I strongly believe we need to stand up against these individuals who do not belong in football or any other sport.”
The Middlesbrough defender scored an own goal in Ireland’s 5-1 World Cup play-off defeat at home to Denmark, the visitors’ first of the night and which put them ahead on aggregate after a 0-0 draw in the first game. “We fully support all efforts to stamp out racism from the game and that includes comments targeting players on social media,” said PFA Ireland’s general secretary, Stephen McGuinness.
“The nature of this incident is really shocking. No player should be subjected to that and we hope that the perpetrator is called to account. This incident should serve as a message that racism needs a response from authorities and team-mates. It cannot be ignored.”
Garrett Mullan, a director ofSRTRC, called for social media networks to play a proactive part in weeding out such abuse and also praised McClean for speaking out. The West Bromwich winger had said the comments received by Christie had “really got to a few players”.
“There is no place for racism in sport or on social media,” Mullan said. “We welcome the fact that the FAI and Gardai are taking action but social media outlets also have a role to play in responding to racism.
“[McClean’s] support for his team-mate will help the team and Cyrus in particular, to emerge stronger from this incident.”


It was the night when Christian Eriksen made one of the grandest statements of his career. Denmark needed him to perform in the World Cup play-off second leg against the Republic of Ireland – and how he answered the call.
The Tottenham Hotspur midfielder’s sumptuous hat-trick in Dublin fired a 5-1 win, qualification to the finals in Russia next summer and a wave of superlatives – the most headline-grabbing of which was from his manager, Age Hareide, who described him as one of the top 10 players in the world.
It is a measure of the pace of modern football, together with its wild extremes, that – seven days on and in the lead-up to Tottenham’s Champions League Group H tie at Borussia Dortmund – Eriksen should talk of rather different emotions. The 2-0 defeat against Arsenal in the north London derby at the Emirates Stadium on Saturday has seen to that. Rather abruptly, he has felt the pedestal swept from underneath him. He is fired to prove himself once again.
“It’s probably good that we have a game so quickly after the derby and you can have a bit of revenge – you can show the world that you are a bit better than what you saw on Saturday,” Eriksen said. “When you get a knock on the head, you’re going to lie down but we need to come back.
“Getting your country to the World Cup is something that you don’t do often and it was very exciting. The game on Saturday was a big difference – a big blow compared to what happened last Tuesday. There was a high and a low and a big gap in between.”
Eriksen went to the 2010 World Cup in South Africa as an 18-year-old prospect and he came on twice as a substitute; the second of his appearances was in the do-or-die final group game against Japan, when Denmark did not do and died. This time he will be the talisman of Hareide’s team, the player who will shoulder the hopes of a nation.
“What the manager said after the Ireland game was a big compliment but talking to the media after a game like that – you put your players anywhere,” Eriksen said, with a smile. “I think I’ve kicked on over the last few years as opposed to just the last 12 months. I’ve shown more consistency. The whole Spurs team have shown incredible improvements.”
The barometers of the progress are numerous. This time last year Tottenham lost 2-1 at Monaco in their penultimate Champions League group phase tie to exit the competition. Now they have qualified for the last 16 after four games and the talk is about what it would mean if they were to top the section.
Two seasons ago Tottenham came to Dortmund in the last 16 of the Europa League and, with an understrength team, they were beaten 3-0. That occasion feels as though it was taken from another era. It also felt instructive that Mauricio Pochettino’s team had been the pre-derby favourites on Saturday, even if they failed to live up to the billing.
“The expectation now is that we win the Champions League and Premier League and I am happy with the pressure and the criticism,” Pochettino said. “It means people expect more of us. We know very well we have improved in every single aspect.”
Eriksen said: “People looked at our group at the start with Real Madrid and Dortmund and said that we’re going to have a tough time and end up in the Europa League. But we’ve shown that we’re better than that and we can compete in the Champions League.”
The criticism that has tracked Pochettino and his players centres on their away record against fellow members of the Premier League’s big six. In 18 such fixtures under Pochettino, they have won only once. Although it is a different competition, they have the opportunity to show their mettle in Dortmund at one of the great venues of European football. Moreover, there is the thing about the trophies – or the lack of them. Some people insist that Pochettino needs to win one to validate his tenure.
“Even though we’ve not won a trophy, I think when you consider where we’ve come from, I definitely think we’re on a positive way going forward,” Eriksen said. “We’ve already more than proved a good signal about Spurs to everyone.”
Pochettino faces a selection dilemma against a Dortmund team that have drawn one and lost four of their last five Bundesliga matches and are all but out of the Champions League after a pair of draws against Apoel Nicosia. The manager, Peter Bosz, dropped the key striker, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, for Friday’s defeat at Stuttgart for disciplinary reasons – he will return against Tottenham – and the overall impression is of a club in disarray.
With qualification assured, Pochettino promised he would make “some changes”. Will he press Dele Alli and Harry Kane into the starting lineup, after both were brought back from injuries against Arsenal?
Alli stands to come face-to-face with Clement Turpin, the referee who took charge of England’s World Cup qualifier against Slovakia in September. That night the midfielder made the single-finger gesture that earned him an international ban and Fifa believed it was directed at Turpin. “I will tell Dele to be careful – if he plays,” Pochettino said.


With Liverpool revelling in what their manager, Jürgen Klopp, calls “the Mo Salah period”, their marked defensive improvement has been overlooked. The changes provoked by a demoralising defeat at Tottenham Hotspur have underpinned an emphatic reaction, however, and face the fiercest examination since Wembley on Tuesday against Sevilla.
Liverpool arrived in Andalusia in punishing form, flushing memories of Spurs out of the system by winning their last four games by an aggregate score of 13-1. A fifth consecutive victory would secure a place in the Champions League knock-out stage with a group game to spare. It would also be a significant statement, given that Sevilla have not lost at the Estadio Ramón Sánchez Pizjuán since 22 November 2016 when they were beaten 3-1 by Juventus. “It has been a really interesting journey in the Champions League so far,” Klopp said. “But this is the game.”
The Liverpool squad flew without the injured Joël Matip but with a sense of defensive security unimaginable one month ago. Liverpool’s two league defeats this season, the 4-1 at Spurs and 5-0 at Manchester City, have inflated their goals against tally to 16 away from home – the division’s worst – and helped maintain the narrative of a vulnerable rearguard.
Yet the defeat of Southampton on Saturday brought a fifth clean sheet in six Premier League home games this season and further evidence of a more defensive approach adopted by Klopp since Wembley. It will be required again in Spain, where a draw will be sufficient for Liverpool to qualify if Spartak Moscow lose to Maribor. Defeat, and an expected home win in Moscow, would leave everything riding on the Russian club’s visit to Anfield on 6 December.
“Tottenham wasn’t a good game,” said Ragnar Klavan, who should retain his place against Sevilla. “But after that we made our corrections and the last four games have been good. Everyone realised that we have to do everything together. We have a lot of quality in attack and we know for sure that the players in front are going to get chances in every game. It has always been defence first and then attack and the manager has always tried to tell us that. But maybe in recent games he has put a little bit more emphasis on that.”
Klopp has not abandoned any football principles to implement change, as Southampton, West Ham United, Maribor and Huddersfield Town can testify, and he is reluctant to divulge too many tactical secrets. Gameplans remain tailored to the opponent but the manager said: “There were a lot of things we changed to make us more stable.” Sitting deeper at West Ham and curbing the attacking instincts of his full-backs, the former Sevilla player Alberto Moreno and Trent Alexander-Arnold, against Southampton were, he admits, part of the pursuit of stability.
“We had two or three situations where it was an individual problem,” Klopp said. “In all the other parts it was a team problem. Huddersfield was similar to West Ham. Huddersfield had no counterattacks and while people might say they didn’t want to counterattack that is not true, they wanted to. That was the first really important step for us.
“For the West Ham game, with the knowledge of what West Ham had to do at home, we decided to sit back more. It was really difficult for the boys. That was different. With a 4-4, and we have this pretty much all the time even if we play 4-3-3, in a lot of defending situations we have this 4-4-1-1. That is how it should be. On this day it was a little bit more clear because of the lineup and because of the three outstandingly quick players. We can’t always play like this but it is an opportunity and that is cool. We never hesitate to do different things, it is only that we need time for it.
“With the full-backs, it’s a waste of potential if we keep them back all the time. When I was a full back and I passed the halfway line, I was shot, but now you do it differently, you have the half-space, you have the ‘eight’, they have to move with the formation. Against Southampton we did it a little bit differently, it was more about the midfield. We built a little bit more up with the midfield, our full-backs were real wingers and our wingers were in the half-space. But it depends on the opponent.”
What has not altered is Klopp’s belief that defending, collectively and individually, starts in the head. He said: “Defending is about being focused. It is not a quality problem. Focus on a situation. When we have the ball be an option to receive it or, if you cannot be an option, give protection. Simple as that. It is not about counter-pressing all the time. Yes, if we can counter-press, then do it. If not, go back and defend together. That is the thing we have lacked in one or two games and I think, and I hope, that we are now a step further in this. Our ‘new’ maturity we will have to show 100% in this atmosphere tomorrow.”


Brighton & Hove Albion twice came from behind to earn a draw at home to Stoke City and extend their unbeaten run to five matches with the home manager, Chris Hughton, grateful his team overcame the referee’s failure to award them a clear first-half penalty.
Pascal Gross and then José Izquierdo replied to goals by Maxim Choupo-Moting and Kurt Zouma to leave both sides with a point on the south coast, on a night when Peter Crouch made history of an altogether different kind.
Brighton remain ninth in the Premier League while Stoke prolonged their own unbeaten run to three matches to stay 15th, four points above the relegation zone. Put to Mark Hughes that four of the five Premier League clubs beneath his side have sacked their managers this season, the Stoke manager smirked. “Why are you asking me?” he said. “If you don’t get results in this game you get sacked, unfortunately.” This, at least, proved thoroughly entertaining fare on a dank evening in east Sussex.
Hughton had described Stoke as a “very manly side”, no doubt a nod to their attritional approach and one that again paid dividends for their opener. Xherdan Shaqiri’s floated ball over the Brighton defence in search of Choupo-Moting caught Lewis Dunk cold – by the time the defender realised the whereabouts of his man, the Stoke striker had coolly slotted his third goal of the season beyond Mathew Ryan, the goalkeeper.
Ruffled after going behind, Brighton were raging when Lee Mason awarded not a spot-kick but a goal-kick six minutes before the interval, when the Stoke captain Ryan Shawcross, already the crowd’s pantomime villain, cut down Glenn Murray inside the box. It really was the definition of a penalty. “I was just waiting for the referee to give it,” Hughton said. Hughes, by comparison, felt the referee, who was roundly booed off at the final whistle, got it right. “I think there was minimal contact,” the Stoke manager said.
Kevin Friend, the fourth official, calmed Hughton over the penalty appeal and played peacemaker moments later when Hughes erupted at Murray’s meaty lunge on Kevin Wimmer. Once Brighton had composed themselves they pulled level, however.
After a relentless driving run past a sea of Stoke shirts Davy Propper crossed for Gross – so often the supplier this season – to smash in an equaliser But less than two minutes later Stoke regained the lead, when Zouma’s header from Choupo-Moting’s flick had the Brighton net rippling once more. Then came the protracted celebrations, with Choupo-Moting joining the Chelsea loanee for a rehearsed jive in front of the North stand. Erik Pieters, too, joined in the fun from halfway.
Izquierdo, a £13.5m club-record signing from Club Brugge last summer, was lively but equally erratic in possession. He went close in the first half, dropping a curling effort wide of Lee Grant’s goal after being slid in superbly by Propper, another summer signing, but he eventually prospered on the hour mark. Murray played in Izquierdo, whose pass pinballed off Pieters and back into his path, allowing the Colombian to rattle it home. “I think he is improving with every week he is with us,” Hughton added. “He admits himself that he has come from a league that perhaps is not as physical and the demands are different.”
Murray thrived throughout as Brighton’s go-to man while another striker in his mid-30s prepared to make Premier League history late on. Stoke summoned Crouch from the bench in place of Shaqiri for the striker to make his 143rd appearance as a Premier League substitute, surpassing the record he previously shared with Shola Ameobi. Another striker, Saido Berahino, did not get on and it is now 633 days since the Stoke forward last found the net.
A gritty draw was not enough for Hughes to feel the benefits of what, on another night, would probably be regarded as a point gained, however. “Our reaction is tinged with disappointment,” he admitted. “Any away point is usually a good result but having got into a winning position on two occasions, that’s where the disappointment lies.”
Brighton, too, tweaked personnel late on – Solly March, Izzy Brown and Ezequiel Schelotto all entered the action – as the Seagulls pushed and pushed for a winner. It never came, though, but despite an evening full of frustration the feelgood factor lives on at the club.


England are considering entrusting their No7 jersey to either Maro Itoje or Chris Robshaw on Saturday in place of Bath’s Sam Underhill, who has been ruled out with concussion. The head coach, Eddie Jones, has previously said he does not see Robshaw as an openside flanker but is running out of specialists before the Test with Samoa on Saturday.
With Underhill stood down after he sustained his second concussion of the autumn, Tom Curry out having dislocated a wrist in training this month and James Haskell exiled from the squad, the other openside candidate currently in Bagshot is Exeter’s Sam Simmonds.
The two main names flagged up by Jones, though, were Itoje and Robshaw, who were first paired in an England back row during the third Test against Australia in Sydney in June 2016. England won that contest 44-40 but Robshaw was replaced in the third quarter by Jack Clifford in a game during which Teimana Harrison was also hauled off after half an hour.
Itoje was subsequently viewed as a strong candidate to start at No7 last autumn only to fracture a hand and miss all of England’s November Tests, offering an unexpected recall to Northampton’s Tom Wood.
With other alternatives such as Wasps’ Sam Jones ruled out by injury and Exeter’s Don Armand still studiously ignored, Jones had been hoping Underhill would nail down the position and establish himself as a regular starter. Unfortunately for all, the 21-year-old had to be replaced inside the first quarter against Australia, having hurt himself tackling the Australian No8 Sean McMahon. He was also concussed playing for Bath against Northampton in September.
“We’ve taken the view that we won’t risk him this weekend,” Jones said.
The upshot could be that both Robshaw and Itoje now start in the back row alongside Nathan Hughes against Samoa, who were beaten by Romania last weekend.
“Robshaw might get the six-and-a-half jersey out again,” joked Jones. “We can roll that out or we can play Maro at seven. We can experiment because in the World Cup we might have to do that. It’s a great opportunity for us.”
The better news for England is that the Harlequins full-back Mike Brown is fit having been concussed against Argentina. Jones is due to trim down his squad on Tuesday evening but does not sound inclined to give all his Lions the week off. “Not necessarily,” he said. “You have got to remember that if we don’t play them they go back to their clubs.”
Jones has been further encouraged by fitness data showing the sprint times of his backs and the number of accelerations per match among his forwards have improved by up to 4% apiece since the last Six Nations. He remains wary, even so, of the Samoans having toured in the islands with Japan. “We went to Fiji and played in a monsoon. I never saw heavier rain. We got absolutely dished. I can still remember our scrum going backwards at a rate of knots. It’s different playing there.”
The Australian was also a fan of the uncompromising Samoan centre Brian Lima and is keen to support Pacific islands rugby. “Certainly it’s important to keep island rugby strong because they bring a uniqueness to the game. They’ve got fantastic natural skills that, when galvanised together, produces a game no one else can play. I’m glad we’re playing Samoa. It’s going to help Samoan rugby.”
As yet the players have not yet collectively discussed Mako Vunipola’s proposal that they all donate at least £1,000 of their £22,000 match fees to their counterparts, whose union has been declared bankrupt. “We’ll have to see what happens this week but we haven’t spoken about it,” said Bath’s Anthony Watson.


British cyclists are disturbed that their former technical director Shane Sutton considered therapeutic use exemptions an acceptable way for athletes to find a marginal gain in their ability to compete.
Jody Cundy said he believed Sir Bradley Wiggins’s name had been “muddied” with the revelation that he had obtained therapeutic use exemptions (TUEs), in effect a doctor’s note to permit banned substances to be taken for the legitimate treatment of a medical condition, on three occasions. They allowed Wiggins to take the corticosteroid Kenacort, allegedly a performance enhancing substance, before the biggest road races of his career, including his 2012 Tour de France victory.
Sutton, who was technical director at British Cycling and remains a consultant for Team Sky, said it was common a few years ago for athletes to use TUEs to “find gains” if they had a minor injury which permitted them to apply for one.
“If you have an athlete who is 95% ready and that little 5% niggle or injury that is troubling him, if you can get that TUE to get him to 100%, yeah of course you would in them days,” the Australian coach said in a BBC documentary, adding: “You definitely don’t cross the line and that’s something we’ve never done.”
It is not clear if Sutton was referring specifically to Wiggins but Cundy, a seven‑times Paralympic champion in swimming and cycling, said he felt those comments would tarnish Wiggins’s reputation. “Shane just tells it as it is so that’s exactly what he said and that’s how it will have been perceived,” Cundy said.
Asked if he was referring to Wiggins, Cundy said: “I don’t care who it is, if they are fiddling the system they are cheating, I can’t stand cheats. It annoys the hell out of me because you’re doing something to beat somebody without having to put in the same effort.
“So, whether it be GB riders or other nations, to see people who are working the system is disheartening. To know there are people that do that 100% but then have extra things going on in the background, because they’ve got a signed piece of paper saying they can take X, Y and Z and whatever drug. If that’s the attitude people are taking to medical things then it’s a good job he [Sutton] has gone.”
One of Britain’s best young riders Katie Archibald, an Olympic champion in the team pursuit, said she did not want to believe Sutton’s suggestion that the TUE system had been exploited. “That sounds outrageous and it is something that I struggle to believe has been true practice,” she said. “I naively want to hope that there’s been some sort of manipulation or mistranslation. That’s completely against the ethics of the sport.”
As British Cycling strives to rescue its reputation after 18 months of allegations of mismanagement, bullying and discrimination, the 23-year-old said it was another blow. “Attaching a term like ‘marginal gains’ to that sort of practice is also quite distressing,” she said, “because it’s almost a trademark British Cycling phrase, isn’t it? Certainly nobody in my squad would attach that practice to the phrase marginal gains.”
British Cycling’s chief executive, Julie Harrington, said no elite British Cycling riders currently had TUEs. “I was really disappointed [by Sutton’s comments],” she said. “When people are using language around TUEs they need to be very mindful of the effect that could have on the public’s perception and the athletes’ reputation.
“They are issued on medical grounds. Not on performance grounds. As a national governing body our own medics have not supported any applications for our current GB athletes.”


Australia’s pacemen will target Joe Root in the opening Ashes Test in an attempt to bring back memories of the bruising series whitewash four years ago when England’s batsmen were “scared” of Mitchell Johnson, according to Nathan Lyon.
Lyon on Monday celebrated his 30th birthday with a series of remarkable and seemingly pre-planned potshots at the tourists before the first Test begins at the Gabba on Thursday, saying England were frightened from No1 to No11 of Johnson’s barrage in 2013 and claiming how “I was at leg slip and I nearly had to push a couple of the guys back towards the stumps”.
He also stated that Australia again hope to end careers, just as they did on the 2013‑14 tour, and talked about that victory as one of his “fondest series”, adding “seeing Mitchell Johnson scare all the Poms was unbelievable”.
Root, who played club cricket in Adelaide with Lyon before either had graduated to the international game, will be watched particularly closely by Australia after he endured a tough first Ashes tour four years ago.
“Root got dropped last time [in Sydney] when he was here, so it’d be good to get him dropped again, wouldn’t it?” Lyon added. “If we can start by opening up that crack, it’s pretty crucial. There’s a lot of scars for the English guys, especially coming over here, especially when we have two guys bowling 150kph, not just one now.
“I don’t want Joe to go out there and say: ‘Mate, there you go, here’s a hundred today.’ I want to take his wicket. I want to put him under pressure. Test-match cricket is about being resilient and, if you can bounce back from your lows, you will have some highs.”
Curiously the other player Lyon took particularly aggressive aim at was Matt Prior, the former England wicketkeeper who was dropped after the third Test on the last tour and played only four more to end what had hitherto been a superb career containing three Ashes series wins.
“It’s an unbelievable feeling,” said Lyon, “knowing that they are broken. Leading into Perth we knew that they were broken, we knew Matt Prior wanted to fly home before the game started and he was one of the senior players.”
Prior, who retired in the summer of 2015, was quick to retort to the barbs. “That’s absolutely laughable. If that was the case and I was scared, why didn’t I go home then? I have no idea where this has come from. Of all the things he could have come up with? That’s completely ridiculous and all I can do is laugh. It is wholeheartedly untrue.”
Lyon is one of only three players remaining in the Australia side from that whitewash of four years ago and he sees it as his role to speak to younger colleagues about the pressures and pleasures of a home Ashes series.
“It’s exciting,” he said. “I’ve been sitting around talking to a lot of the younger fellas who haven’t played an Ashes about the excitement around the series, what it’s like from the media point of view, the pressures from the fans and your family. It’s incredible. It’s the pinnacle for an Australian cricketer to play against the English at home, and hopefully recreate some history.”
Lyon appears to have picked up the mantle of rabble-rouser-in-chief. He says England will be subject to an even more hostile attack this time, with Mitchell Starc and Pat Cummins quicker than Johnson, and “the best bowler in the world”, Josh Hazlewood, hammering away at the other end.
“To have two guys bowling that fast, I know especially on my birthday I’m not getting in the nets this afternoon to face them because they are bowling way too quick for my liking,” he said. “They are class bowlers. In the nets they are definitely quicker [than Johnson]. I saw Steve Smith land on his backside the other day, Johnson didn’t do that.”
Lyon also believes that Root and his England team-mates will underestimate his spin, and look to hit him out of the attack out of necessity, because of the fast bowlers’ class. It is no coincidence that Lyon has crept his way to the top of Australia’s finger-spinning charts – with 269 wickets in 69 Tests. He is a class operator whom England would be unwise to take lightly.
“Definitely [people underestimate me]. Ask Joe Root, he definitely does,” Lyon added. “It’s part of the game being a tiny little off-spinner who bowls at 86kph, not 150. I love being the underdog, I love flying under the radar and the challenges that lie ahead.
“My partnership with Mitch Johnson at the Gabba [in 2013-14] … where we took six for nine and broke the spine of the English there and then, on the second day of the Ashes series … my role is crucial. I know my role, I’m excited by it. I know they will target me. They did in England, they’ve done it before and I’m looking forward to that challenge.”


Amanda Staveley’s Dubai-based financial advisory firm PCP Capital Partners has formally offered Mike Ashley a sum in the region of £300m for Newcastle United after conducting preliminary due diligence on the club’s finances.
Newcastle’s owner, who wanted nearer £400m, is pondering his next move and on Monday night was still to accept the bid in principle. Should the Sports Direct owner do so a period of exclusivity would be entered into during which specialist lawyers would undertake a period of formal due diligence. This process usually takes around a month, dictating that a final deal could theoretically still be negotiated and completed by Christmas, although a new‑year completion seems more likely.
Staveley, believed to have lodged her bid late last week, hopes the takeover will be completed by the turn of the year in order to provide Rafael Benítez with the funds needed to reinforce his squad in the January transfer window. Newcastle’s manager was disillusioned by Ashley’s failure to strengthen the team following last spring’s promotion and there are real fears he could be tempted to resign should no funds prove forthcoming in January. It is no exaggeration to say the Spaniard’s future on Tyneside could hinge on the success or otherwise of Staveley’s bid.
If Ashley, who would be disinclined to spend during the coming window, lost Benítez, the club would become infinitely less attractive to potential buyers and a third relegation in his decade long tenure could become a real danger.
Although the sports retail tycoon has been keen to sell Newcastle for most of this year, he did not formally place the club on the market until October when his lawyer announced he hoped to have sold up by Christmas. Shortly after a move regarded as an attempt to smoke out prospective purchasers and possibly create something of an auction, it emerged that Ashley had signed Non Disclosure Agreements (NDAs) with five parties including Staveley’s.
The 44-year-old Yorkshirewoman – understood to be backed by investors in not only the Gulf, where she boasts peerless contacts, but the Far East and United States – has been conducting due diligence for the past month and appears to be the only serious bidder left standing.
PCP Capital Partners has access to around £28bn of Middle Eastern wealth and its standing is testament to Staveley’s renown as a deal-maker.
Long known as a facilitator of football takeovers she helped broker the agreement which saw Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed al-Nahyan take control of Manchester City in 2009 and was heavily involved in Dubai International Capital’s attempt to buy Liverpool a year earlier.
She watched Newcastle’s 1-1 draw with Liverpool in October from the St James’ Park directors’ box but has since stayed away from the ground, instead sending her representatives to matches.


The suspended leader of amateur boxing’s governing body, Aiba, has announced he is stepping down amid allegations of financial mismanagement but remarkably will be named as the organisation’s honorary president.
Wu Ching-kuo’s resignation follows a divisive 11-year reign, characterised by a bitter power struggle in recent times. Last month Aiba’s disciplinary commission voted unanimously to suspend the 70-year-old. He was alleged to have accumulated debt of 15m Swiss francs for the organisation through poor financial management and auditing. He was also accused of trying to depose the members of the executive committee who challenged his leadership.
Bizarrely, the investigation into these claims appears to have been quietly dropped. A joint statement between Wu and the Swiss-based organisation said: “They have amicably agreed to resolve the management issues within Aiba and to withdraw and terminate all related pending procedures before civil courts and Aiba disciplinary commission.”
Wu claimed he is stepping down from his post to “resolve the management issues” within the governing body. He will be replaced by Franco Falcinelli, Aiba’s senior vice-president. “I remain committed to ensure a smooth handover to the new leadership,” Wut said. Aiba will convene an extraordinary congress with its national member federations on 27 January in Dubai to consider proposed changes to its governance.
Wu was provisionally suspended by a disciplinary commission last month after a complaint from 11 Aiba executive committee members who alleged he had “violated and continues to violate various provisions of Aiba’s statutes and codes”.
Aiba has been riven with infighting for months, with Taiwan’s Wu pitted against most of the executive committee who failed to remove him through a vote of no confidence in July.


The signs were ominous. The conspicuous presence of Guochuan Lai, West Bromwich Albion’s usually absent Chinese owner, for his team’s Premier League defeat at the hands of visiting Chelsea spoke volumes and the emphatic nature of the scoreline was enough to seal the fate of Tony Pulis. The Welshman, who took over in January 2015, had the air of a dead man walking in the wake of Saturday’s 4-0 gubbing. He was duly sacked on Monday and leaves the club a point and a place above the relegation zone.
Fans who have long been bored witlessby an unattractive brand of football that was no longer yielding the kind of results that led to finishes in 13th, 14th and 10th over the past three seasons have finally got what they wanted. The question now is whether they will regret the decision to sack the first man they would almost certainly approach with a view to extracting them from the current pickle if it was not he who had got them into it in the first place.
Pulis has famously never been relegated during a management career spanning nine clubs across 25 years. Arguably his greatest feat as a manager involved the unlikely rescue of Crystal Palace, who had four points in the Premier League when he took over four years ago this week but finished 11th, 12 points off the drop.
It was an escape act that earned Pulis the Premier League manager of the year accolade, even if his relationship with the chairman, Steve Parish, subsequently ended in the most bitter of acrimony at eye-wateringly huge personal expense and embarrassment to Pulis in the high court.
Pulis has been long renowned as a firefighter whose pragmatic, functional style of football was tolerated by fans as long as it yielded results, guaranteed top-flight survival and ensured the Premier League revenue kept rolling in. However, his touch appears to have deserted him in the past year.
With the air of a man who seemed well aware his latest jig would be up sooner rather than later, he was in relaxed but defensive mood before the Chelsea game. “If I left tomorrow, I’d put my record on the table and put it in front of anybody and see what they think of what I’ve done here in three years,” he said.
Examination shows that, when Pulis replaced Alan Irvine on 1 January 2015, West Bromwich were exactly where they are now: fourth from bottom of the table, one point above the relegation zone.
Irvine won four of his 19 league games in charge before he was sacked seven months after being appointed. He had secured 20 points and Pulis added 24 to secure a finish with 44 points and five places clear of trouble. The following season they finished 14th with 43 points but dramatically fell away once the safety associated with the 40-point mark had been secured. Last season they finished 10th with 45 points but failed to kick on after guaranteeing their top-flight status, drawing two and losing seven of their last nine matches.
More worryingly Albion, having won only four of their past 22 Premier League games, have not emerged victorious from a top-flight match since 19 August, have drawn only four of their past 10 and are on course for 31 or 32 points by mid-May. The end-of-season sluggishness with which many Pulis teams are associated, coupled with the fact that they have been beaten by sides such as Brighton, Southampton and Huddersfield already, suggest a sleepwalk towards relegation is – or certainly was – on the cards.
Furthermore, in 107 Premier League matches under Pulis, West Bromwich have scored three or more goals on only eight occasions and have beaten teams in the current top six in five of 33 attempts. What Pulis has done at The Hawthorns in three years appears to be little more than the bare minimum expected: survival through turgid football, not many goals and even fewer surprises. It is small wonder the fans turned on a manager who, despite his net spend of £40m during the summer, appears to have succeeded only in making a very mediocre squad considerably worse.
Despite the doom-merchants who insist West Bromwich fans should be careful what they wish for, all available evidence suggests that the time was right for the club and their manager to consciously uncouple. With players of the calibre of Jay Rodriguez, Grzegorz Krychowiak, Salomón Rondón and Nacer Chadli, among others, Albion have the makings of a team considerably better than the sum of the parts cobbled together in recent months.
Pulis, meanwhile, leaves with a golden handshake and no shortage of credit in the bank. In these days of increasingly twitchy, trigger-happy owners desperate to remain in the Premier League, a man of his specialist talents is unlikely to be out of work for long.


Pep Guardiola believes the loss of John Stones will present Manchester City with a tough examination of their title credentials. Stones, whose outstanding form led him to play back-to-back 90-minute games for England against Germany and Brazil, now faces six weeks out with the hamstring injury sustained in the win at Leicester on Saturday.
The return of the captain, Vincent Kompany, after his own lay-off is timely but, given the Belgian’s patchy fitness record, the Premier League leaders appear short of cover in central defence. Nicolás Otamendi is back after a one-game domestic ban but the only other specialist options are Eliaquim Mangala and the largely untried youngster Tosin Adarabioyo.
“We don’t have a big squad,” Guardiola said before Tuesday’s Champions League game at home against Feyenoord. “It is a big pity we lost a month and a half of Vincent Kompany and now John Stones. To win the titles we need all the squad, especially important players like John and Vinny.
“ On the other side we have an opportunity. We have to play 12 games in a short space of time with only three central defenders. One of them is a risk, in Vincent only just back. It is not easy but I want to see how we react. Always when you are champions you have to handle the big situations, the tough situations.
“When everyone is ready and comfortable, that is not when you get credit. We are going to see how we react in the most important moment of the season. Until [City play] Watford, on 2 January, it is about how we react.”
Mangala, who spent last season on loan at Valencia, looked set to leave in the summer but City’s failure to sign Jonny Evans from West Bromwich Albion earned him a reprieve. He came on for Stones at Leicester. The 26-year-old, sitting alongside Guardiola at his press conference, said: “Football is like this. You have to be ready to take the opportunity. We need more than 11 players. Every player has to be ready to play.”
Guardiola admits deciding which of his strikers, Sergio Agüero or Gabriel Jesus, should play is an even harder call. He said: “Now it is the toughest decision because both have their different qualities and they deserve to play. They have a lot of games and they have to be ready and prepare well.” Guardiola added that he had not played both together recently, as he did earlier in the season, because injury to the left-back Benjamin Mendy had increased reliance on the winger Leroy Sané.
City have secured a place in the Champions League last 16, so the pressure is off for Feyenoord’s visit but Guardiola said: “I prepare the same way as always and that’s to win the game.”


England were served the briefest injury scare on their day off as Stuart Broad was struck on the lower back by a wayward ball while on the putting green at Brisbane Golf Club. He earned a bruise, just as most players did when paintballing in Townsville last week, but nothing more. Broad is fine for the first Ashes Test on Thursday and so, happily, is his touring room-mate and county team-mate, Jake Ball, who has recovered from his ankle ligament strain and appears favourite to beat Craig Overton to the fourth seamer’s spot.
Overton has performed admirably, fulfilling many roles (although not managing to score a run), in the tour matches and appeared set to benefit from Ball’s injury, sustained in Adelaide 11 days ago. Ball’s recovery, though, has been swift and impressive, partly because England’s medical team were initially intentionally overzealous with their protection of him. “I’m 100% confident that I can get through a five-day Test,” Ball said. “From the second I did it, we’ve had a plan to be fit for the first Test and everything has gone to plan, if not better. I’m in a really good position.”
Overton will surely play at some stage but Ball is the preference of Trevor Bayliss, who believes his natural length and testing bounce suit Australian pitches perfectly – a theory proved correct in the early throes of the tour, with Ball superb on a tough day in the field for England in Perth.
He will wear an ankle support throughout the series to protect the injury, which is causing him no discomfort. He got through 17 overs of bowling – including some in the middle at the game’s conclusion – on the final day of the tour game in Townsville, and fielded for the morning session too. He is confident he is up to the rigours of his fourth Test match.
As Australia bombard England with chat about the impending physical threat posed by their fast bowlers, Ball believes that the tourists’ attack – a good deal slower, but full of wiles – can compete with Pat Cummins, who has come close to bowling 100mph, and Mitchell Starc, who blasts tails away with ease. Josh Hazlewood, they all say, is the best of the lot.
“I think the skill level we have is very high,” Ball said. “They have the pace but, as we’ve seen, if they’re not fully on then pace can disappear quite quickly. Our batters have faced 90mph bowling in the past – it’s not something new – so they’ll be comfortable. They’ve trained for it. They’ll go out there and hopefully put the pressure back on them.”
One man who says he will enjoy the Australians’ pace is Dawid Malan, who has enjoyed a far smoother build up to his first Ashes Test than Ball. He has looked impressive in all three tour matches, making two fifties and a century in four innings. He had never been to Australia before this tour but the pace and bounce of the surfaces suited him instantly. He has left well too, but is expecting plenty of short stuff come Thursday – a prospect that excites him.
“I do enjoy that, and I like getting my heart beating and it makes you feel alive,” he said. “I don’t think many people enjoy facing it, but it is a great challenge and when you walk off, whether you’ve got 100 or nought, the moment you sit down you can feel the adrenaline disappear and it is a feeling you can’t replicate anywhere else.
“Speaking to some of the older Aussie players, they talk about having heart more than about having technique and it is about how bad you want it and how willing you are to take the odd blow and guts it through. I do think it is more about your ticker here than anything else.”
Malan says England’s batsmen, prompted by the captain Joe Root, have hardened themselves so they will not be caught off guard this week, as England were four years ago by Mitchell Johnson.
“I think Mitchell Johnson took the boys by surprise a bit,” Malan said. “I spoke to Rooty about his first Test here and he said the occasion really got to him. He said the first innings he had was all a bit of a blur and his adrenaline got going with the crowd and he ended up playing a shot he wouldn’t have played in a normal situation, so it is about managing your own emotions when you’re out there which is key.
“Coming into this series we are prepared for that, whether we play it well or not, or handle it well or not is a different story and that remains to be seen, but we’ve prepared well for it and it is what happens in the middle that counts.”


As Warren Gatland prepares Wales to face his native New Zealand for perhaps the final time he says the flurry of blows landed by the local media before the Lions met the All Blacks last summer made him mentally tougher, although there were “one or two people” he would not mind getting into the corner of a room with.
Gatland, who was depicted as a clown by one New Zealand paper before the Lions rallied from 1-0 down to share the series, expects more demeaning caricatures this week but said anyone looking to turn Saturday’s encounter at the Principality Stadium into a feud between him and the All Blacks’ head coach, Steve Hansen, would be wasting time.
“People try to make a lot of stuff about Steve and me,” Gatland said. “From my point of view there are no issues between us. I have a huge amount of respect for what he has achieved in the game and the success he has had as an All Black coach. He has been absolutely outstanding. I look forward to catching up with him on Saturday and having a beer after the game. In recent years on a couple of occasions we have gone out as two management groups for meals during the week. The pressures we are under are not as a result of our relationship but about people trying to stoke the fires. He understands that; I understand that.
“If there is [media] criticism of me this week I won’t be responding because you cannot win. At some stage I will be dressed up as a clown again; I will just take it on the chin and move on. That is the way it is and the way it has gone. It was tough [on the Lions tour] and I said so but Kiwis understand when you back someone into a corner they come out fighting. There was no way I was going to allow something to get the better of me and I got mentally tougher.
“I felt like I was in a boxing match and was going to come out on top. No one was going to split the squad but there was some pretty underhand stuff going on. There are one or two people I would like to get into a corner of a room on their own with me but that might wait for another day.”
Gatland was speaking after making an unscheduled appearance at Wales’s media briefing on Monday. He usually fronts up on the day of the team announcement but he wanted to clarify what happened towards the end of the match against Georgia on Saturday after the prop Tomas Francis was sent to the sin-bin in the last minute and, with the visitors awarded a penalty close to the Wales line, the match went to uncontested scrums because the other tighthead, Leon Brown, was suffering from cramp after being replaced by Francis.
“It wasn’t us trying to pull a fast one or anything like that,” Gatland said. “We didn’t try and manipulate anything in terms of the laws. It was different to what France did against us at the end of this year’s Six Nations because they had a prop come off injured while another had been warming up. Leon’s calves were tight and there is video evidence to show he was injured. We were not trying to pull the wool over anyone’s eyes.”
Wales’s laboured victory over a team who had never defeated a tier one opponent did nothing to suggest they will arrest a 64-match losing streak against New Zealand on Saturday but back in 2014, one week after they had hung on to beat Fiji 17-13 having failed to score in the second half, Wales led the All Blacks going into the final quarter before leaking three tries.
New Zealand were holding on against Scotland last Saturday against opponents they had never lost to. “They will be disappointed with that game,” said Gatland. “Scotland took it to them but New Zealand still won and had that x-factor when they needed to turn it on. I have never seen an All Black team that is vulnerable. They will be disappointed they did not play better with the quality and depth they have but they coped with the pressure and won that game. That is what it is all about.
“The All Blacks have made comments themselves [that] they have dominated the game for too long. People want to see the All Blacks come under pressure and teams pushing them close. We’ve had that in the last few weeks with Australia beating them and South Africa and Scotland pushing them close. It’s good for rugby that sides are able to push the number one team in the world really closely. We expect the All Blacks to front up against us, hurting a little but knowing they have not played to their potential, but we have got to put them under pressure and play some rugby.”
Sam Cane has vowed there will be no repeat of the attitude that nearly resulted in New Zealand losing against Scotland for the first time last weekend when they face Wales on Saturday in their final Test of the year. The match in Cardiff will be New Zealand’s 15th of 2017, including the victory against the Barbarians at Twickenham at the start of November, and the flanker Cane said the focus was on enjoying their final week together as a squad and making sure their attitude was right.
“Last Saturday was a reminder that every team we are up against go out there to play the game of their lives,” he said. “We need to play to a really high standard. We turned up in Edinburgh and maybe our attitude was just a fraction off. It does not take much and this week we have to make sure we are exactly where we need to be.
“Sometimes you can gauge if the attitude is not quite there, but even if you say something as part of the leadership group to get it back on track, it is often too late. The prep and the build-up to go out there and win little battles takes all week. It is pretty tough to just turn up and flick a switch. It was yes and no whether we did that last week as it is different for individuals. There were a couple of guys who thought ‘not sure’.”
Cane said that the review of the 22-17 victory, which was secured when Beauden Barrett made a try-saving tackle on Stuart Hogg in the final minute, was not a video nasty. “We did not look at much footage,” he said. “There was a lot of discussion around different players’ processes in terms of turning up at kick-off to rip into it at a 10/10 level. Sometimes in the final week of the year less is more in terms of the training load. The key is to turn up on Saturday with a full tank of energy, together with the mental stuff.”
It will mark a return to Wales for the New Zealand head coach, Steve Hansen, who spent three years in Cardiff from 2001. “I have not had an inkling that he is treating it differently to any other Test,” Cane said. “Steve is one of the most competitive people I know. It does not matter who we are playing, he is keen to win.
“We want to finish the season on the right note. We have learned a lot about ourselves this year, adversity teaches you a few things. We have been in pretty tough places in some games and guys had to step into roles they are not used to in this team. Next year we will have 40 or 50 quality players with experience of Test rugby and I think we are in a good place.” Paul Rees


Chris Coleman stepped on to the stage, smiled at the television cameras and announced a manifesto for change centred on humility, honesty and hope.
Sunderland’s ninth manager in six years was unveiled at the Academy of Light, the club’s training ground, on Monday morning and looked genuinely thrilled to be confronted with the challenge of lifting his new team off the bottom of the Championship.
To Coleman’s left sat Martin Bain, the club’s chief executive. If Bain seemed a little washed out in the wake of a draining few months, the former Wales manager appeared radiant, his eyes sparkling with enthusiasm. Many people are puzzled at the 47-year-old’s decision to swap a Wales side he led to the semi-finals of Euro 2016 for a club facing a second successive relegation but it was not one over which Coleman agonised.
“You can go through your career without ever managing a big club and this is a huge club,” Coleman said. “The temptation to be a part of that and experience that and try to make a difference here was just too big for me.
“I’ve got the opportunity to manage a big football club, a seriously big football club and I wasn’t going to turn that down. I know all the challenges here, I’m under no illusions. But I am super-excited. I can’t tell you how excited I am. I always wondered whether I’d get an opportunity to manage a big club and I’ve got it now.”
Certain of his predecessors, most notably David Moyes, acted as if they were doing Sunderland a favour simply by being there but Coleman sees things very differently. “There’s not many Premier League clubs as big as Sunderland, with their fanbase and stadium and facilities,” he said. “Not many Premier League clubs have all this. I’m absolutely thrilled to be here.”
There is much to be done. He is anxious to find a home in the north-east for his wife and two small children but, more immediately, there is Tuesday night’s tough trip to Aston Villa to navigate and uncomfortable home truths to be delivered in the dressing room.
Simon Grayson’s successor made it plain he has been warned that his new squad is in desperate need of pulling its collective socks up. “The biggest word in football, and it’s a dirty word – no one likes to use it – is accountability,” Coleman said. “Every player on a contract is accountable for what happens to this club. Everyone has roles and responsibilities.
“You can sometimes look at someone and give them the benefit of the doubt but there are other things you look at and say: ‘That’s not acceptable.’ There’s still time to improve but this club is standing on the edge of a cliff and we need to move to safe ground. We need to get our preparation right and we need to be professional.”
All the indications are that he intends to change a somewhat laissez-faire environment to a “no excuses” culture. “This is not a place to be if you haven’t got heart,” he said. “If you haven’t got heart and courage then you shouldn’t be at this club. If players are pretending to give their best I can’t handle it.
“I won’t tolerate players not giving everything they’ve got. This is a great club and we have the duty of taking it forward.”
Too many past managers have merely lived in the region part-time, retaining their main home elsewhere while spending a few days a week on Wearside. Coleman refuses to rank among them. “I’m fully committed to this area. If I wasn’t, I wouldn’t have moved my family up here.”
Although Ellis Short, the Sunderland owner, is no longer trying to sell up and is apparently reinvigorated by the Welshman’s installation, the club’s debts dictate that Coleman’s scope for manoeuvre in the January transfer market will be limited.
“Maybe we’ll generate some cash ourselves,” Coleman said. “I’ve not been handed a huge transfer kitty. I’m not going into January with millions to spend so we need to improve the players we have. We have to build a new culture here.”


Arsenal have secured Borussia Dortmund’s Sven Mislintat as their new head of recruitment. The Gunners have drafted in the highly rated 45-year-old, who will start in December. Steve Rowley has stood down as chief scout after 25 years with the north London club.
Mislintat had been at Dortmund for almost a decade, during which time the Bundesliga club recruited names such as Robert Lewandowski, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, Shinji Kagawa and Ousmane Dembélé.
“We are delighted that Sven is joining us,” said the Arsenal manager, Arsène Wenger. “Identifying and developing talent is a core part of our philosophy and Sven has an outstanding track record over many years. We look forward to him taking our existing recruitment approach forwards.”
Mislintat will work alongside Wenger and the chief executive, Ivan Gazidis, to unearth new talent for the Gunners. Rowley will continue to work with Arsenal in a consultancy role despite stepping down from his permanent position as chief scout.
“We would like to thank Steve Rowley for all his hard work over many years for the club,” Wenger told Arsenal’s official club website. “He has been a key figure in our recruitment of so many top players and has travelled thousands and thousands of miles, watching hundreds of games for us during his time at the club. We wish him well for the future.”


They look like a couple of nice boys. Wheatfield hair, slightly awkward smiles. Helpful at charity days, polite at press conferences, respectful about others in their field. Not quite with the cherubic aspect they had when beginning their current vocation, but hints of those chubby dimply faces remain.
Steve Smith and Joe Root, Ashes captains, don’t fit the mould. It’s supposed to be all tough guys and hard bastards, sledging and chuntering, flint-eyed glares and “broken fucken arms”. Chappell, Border, Illingworth, Jardine, a legacy built on rough words and wads of brutalised chewing gum.
Smith and Root are staunch, don’t doubt it. They’ve faced down scary bowling in draining conditions, soaked up scrutiny and pressure, and come out as two of the world’s best practitioners of their niche and particular art. Fifty-one international centuries between them, leaders of their sides by their mid-20s.
They have never faced off in an Ashes before, but they could face off in three or four more. It could be one of the great rivalries. And it could be completely different to what we’ve come to expect. The two sides are not built in the image of those captains, but follow their style closely enough. This is a different time.
After the fourth Test against India at Dharamsala this year, concluding an often fractious series, the question was whether this Australian team would follow the hard-edged route of the 2013-14 whitewashers. “I don’t think this group is at that stage,” said coach Darren Lehmann.
“Obviously we’re less aggressive than we have been in the past. They have had to work out the way they want to play as a group and I think it has been brilliant. I have actually changed a bit in my ways as a coach and I’ve really enjoyed watching how they go about it.”
Root, meanwhile, waxed lyrical in an All Out Cricket interview about the stated values of his primary school, including kindness and creativity. “All the best leaders have those qualities… We have some great blokes in the team who know how to behave and interact with people not just in the squad but those outside cricket who hold all those values as well. When you have the same views you become closer as a team.”
There were a million ill-informed column inches in the 2000s about Michael Clarke being “metrosexual” because of an earring and a tattoo; it was a sort of mass howl of old men terrified at their own irrelevance. These days players like Usman Khawaja, Nic Maddinson, Peter Nevill and Adam Zampa can dress sharp, engage in cultural pursuits and not surrender their bona fides as cricketers.
Khawaja and Moeen Ali have prompted and led conversations about religion and race, and avoid the booze-soaked sponsorship and celebrations that remain standard. Alastair Cook is the quiet old pro, Pat Cummins an eloquent chap who has just finished his university degree.
Chris Woakes, Peter Handscomb, Matthew Renshaw, Jos Buttler, all fit the nice boy mould. Mitchell Starc, Josh Hazlewood, Stuart Broad are more senior, but come across as pleasant human beings. There is the odd snarl, the odd throw at the stumps in the follow-through, but even that seems like it’s for show.
Doing it for show was what came to mind recently with David Warner’s lines about hatred and war. Warner is the embodiment of Australian cricket’s change. The hard-drinking attack dog repudiated his ways, saying he was pushed to be aggressive by Lehmann and Clarke. In the West Indies in 2015, he adopted a monastic silence, and in the months thereafter became The Reverend.
Teetotal, fittingly, Warner got into mindfulness and meditation. “I basically preached for a good month,” he said in a June interview. “Whenever I was at training and someone said something negative I would reiterate three positive things about them.”
Another quiet operator, Nathan Lyon, came out with his own slew of aggressive comments on Monday, saying that Australia wanted to end careers, that the 2013-14 tourists were terrified from “one to 11”, and that it was an “unbelievable feeling” to watch a team disintegrate. “There’s a lot of scars for the English guys, especially coming over here, especially when we have two guys bowling 150, not just one now.”
The antagonistic comments have a feel of fake it till you make it. Of senior players thinking that it’s their responsibility to escalate the war of words, rather than something they naturally want to do. Perhaps it reflects the faintest flicker of doubt in even the hardest of Ashes captains. “We have to hate them,” Jardine exhorted his bowler Gubby Allen, who refused to batter Australia with Bodyline tactics. “It’s the only way we’re going to beat them.”
But beyond that, it raises a broader question: can you actually be yourself in the confines of an Ashes series? Do you have to conform? Starting with their leaders, the current forms of Australia and England both look like teams that have realised they’re better suited to another way.
Clarke had the line about broken arms, but Starc’s best against Pakistan last December was, “Send his bails to Wales.” Australia’s sledging is dross. They’re pretending, and it’s not convincing. The speculation about whether Ben Stokes will join the tour is relevant – he’s always praised for bringing combativeness, but that attitude hasn’t more broadly brought good things. Root and Smith are some of the world’s best without it. But there survives the idea that it’s needed, among the things that are less pleasing about sport: the pressure to conform, to close ranks and close minds. Perhaps this time around, a few nicer boys can show that’s not needed.


Michael Cheika’s conduct during Australia’s 30-6 defeat by England at Twickenham has been referred for investigation by World Rugby.
The Wallabies head coach was infuriated by a number of refereeing decisions and when a Michael Hooper try was disallowed in the first half, he appeared to mouth “fucking genius” in reference to the decision made by the referee Ben O’Keeffe.
When asked during a broadcast interview if he had actually called O’Keeffe a “fucking cheat”, Cheika ended the interview.
On two occasions he walked down the steps from the coaches’ box to the touchline to remonstrate with officials and received abuse from supporters that he described as a “gobful” that was “not pleasant”, at one point resulting in a verbal exchange with a fan.
Jon Davis, the disciplinary officer for the autumn internationals, is looking into his behaviour on Saturday afternoon.
“Following various media reports and a referral from World Rugby, the comments and conduct attributed to Michael Cheika are being investigated. An update will be issued tomorrow [Tuesday],” read a statement issued by the body that oversees disciplinary matters for the November Tests.


Terry Glenn, the wide receiver who caught Tom Brady’s first ever touchdown pass, has died at the age of 43. According to the Dallas County medical examiner’s office Glenn was killed in a “suspected motor vehicle accident” in the early hours of Monday morning.
Glenn was the seventh overall pick in the 1996 NFL draft after a brilliant final year of college football at Ohio State. He played six seasons for the Patriots before joining the Green Bay Packers in 2002, and spent the final years of his career with the Cowboys before retiring in 2007.
His 90 receptions for the Patriots in his first year in the league were a record for a rookie at the time and he was named to the Pro Bowl in 1999. However, his career in New England ended on a sour note after an arrest and a failed drug test led to him being deactivated from the roster running up to the Patriots’ Super Bowl victory. He was revived at the Cowboys though and had more than 1,000 receiving yards in both of his two final full seasons.
Loved this man. My son asked me a decade ago who my favorite receiver ever was because he wanted that jersey for Christmas. He got a Terry Glenn jersey from Santa. TG overcame horrible adversity to become a really good man. May your soul rest in peace my friend.
A post shared by Drew Bledsoe (@drewbledsoe) on Nov 20, 2017 at 8:28am PST
The former Patriots quarterback Drew Bledsoe paid tribute to his former team-mate Glenn on Monday. “Loved this man,” wrote Bledsoe on Instagram. “My son asked me a decade ago who my favorite receiver ever was because he wanted that jersey for Christmas. He got a Terry Glenn jersey from Santa. TG overcame horrible adversity to become a really good man. May your soul rest in peace my friend.”


Outlander has become the second Irish-trained horse to be committed to Saturday’s Betfair Chase but the Jockey Club’s £1m lure apparently played no part in the decision. “No, I don’t care about the million, to be honest,” said his trainer, Gordon Elliott, at his stables here in Ireland. “I won’t be getting it.”
The £1m is on offer to any horse who wins the Betfair, the King George on Boxing Day and the Cheltenham Gold Cup in March, a hat-trick that Kauto Star pulled off a decade ago. But Elliott denied having been told to go in pursuit of the pot by Outlander’s owner, who has famously made a fortune through his association with a budget airline. “I don’t think the million would interest Michael O’Leary too much,” Elliott said, wryly.
“Listen, to be honest, the chances of our lad winning the three is very slim but, if you’re not in, you can’t win. So we’ll take our chance.
“Don Cossack on his day might be the horse that could have done it. But it’s hard to do it. Just to get a horse to turn up on the three days in peak order. It’s a massive incentive to do it and I’d love to have a horse good enough but listen, I don’t know if our horse is, to be honest.”
Up the road at Moone Jessica Harrington was much more upbeat about her chances with Sizing John, the horse she turned into a top-class staying chaser last winter after inheriting him from Henry de Bromhead. The main concern has been whether the horse can be fit enough for his first run since April, in which he will face race-fit rivals like Cue Card and Bristol De Mai.
But Harrington revealed on Monday that she has taken him for “away days” not once but three times in her determination to get him ready for Saturday’s venture to Haydock. A spin on The Curragh was followed by two miles jumping fences at Naas and then a mile and a half gallop round Punchestown on Sunday.
Harrington was in jovial mood on the gallops but her eyes narrowed and her manner became grave as she said: “I’ve got him as fit as I can hopefully. And he seems to be in good form there this morning. He was throwing his head around when he came in after working yesterday. But you never know until you get them as far as the racecourse.”
Robbie Power, the jockey who partnered Sizing John to Gold Cup glory in March, seemed similarly optimistic about the horse’s readiness. “Look, I couldn’t be happier with him. He’s as ready as we can get him without having a race.”
Power described how Sizing John had blossomed last winter after being stepped up in distance, having repeatedly struggled to match the best at two miles. “You talk about confidence in a jockey or a sportsperson but I think horses need confidence as well and he’d been getting his arse spanked by Douvan all the time.
“I think the horse got his confidence back when he was getting his head in front. His work from Leopardstown to Cheltenham was something we hadn’t seen him do before. He just got better and better and the last couple of weeks I was fairly hopeful he would win the Gold Cup.”
Bristol De Mai heads the betting for the Betfair at odds of 7-4 after Monday’s entry stage, with six rivals left to take him on. Sizing John is a 9-4 shot with Outlander an outsider on 10-1.
Harrington had news of future arrangements for the horses owned by Alan Potts, who died last week, which include Sizing John. It appears that Potts, who was 80, transferred the ownership to a limited company some months ago and made arrangements for the horses to be trained until their retirement, in the event of his passing. “The horses are to run away until they’ve stopped running,” Harrington said. But she does not expect that Potts’s heirs would be seeking to buy young horses and certainly not at the rate or the expense that Potts did himself.

West Bromwich Albion are prepared to take time to consider their options after Tony Pulis was relieved of his post on Monday following a poor run of results that culminated in the 4-0 home thrashing by Chelsea on Saturday, with Nigel Pearson, Alan Pardew and Martin O’Neill among the potential candidates to succeed him.
Gary Megson, who was manager between 2000 and 2004 and returned to the club in the summer as Pulis’s assistant, has been put in caretaker charge and is expected to take control for at least this weekend’s trip to face Tottenham at Wembley. But with West Brom currently only a point clear of the relegation zone after 13 matches, the club’s hierarchy are aware of the importance of making a swift appointment, with the home fixture against Newcastle United next Tuesday quickly followed by the visit of the bottom side, Crystal Palace.
The club’s Chinese owner, Guochaun Lai, and chairman, John Williams, have made Premier League experience a priority, which would appear to rule out both of the early frontrunners with the bookmakers: the Northern Ireland manager, Michael O’Neill, and Aberdeen’s Derek McInnes, who spent three seasons at the club as a player.
Pardew, who gave West Brom’s technical director, Nicky Hammond, his first coaching role at Reading and has been out of work since being sacked by Palace last December, could come under consideration, while Pearson is currently employed by the Belgian Second Division side OH Leuven having previously served as assistant to Bryan Robson at The Hawthorns between 2004 and 2006. Martin O’Neill’s future as the Republic of Ireland manager is unclear despite the 65-year-old verbally agreeing to extend his contract before the World Cup play-off defeat by Denmark but would provide the requisite experience.
Pulis, whose side had won only twice in their last 21 Premier League matches, becomes the fifth Premier League manager to lose his job this season after Frank de Boer, Craig Shakespeare, Ronald Koeman and Slaven Bilic.
“These decisions are never taken lightly but always in the interests of the club,” said the chairman, John Williams, in a statement on Monday. “We are in a results business and over the back end of last season and this season to date, ours have been very disappointing. We would like to place on record our appreciation of Tony’s contribution and hard work during a period of transition for the club which included a change of ownership. We wish him well in his future endeavours.”
Pulis took over at The Hawthorns in January 2015 and West Brom finished 13th, 14th and 10th under him. This season’s dismal form continues a run which began in April. The Welshman replaced Alan Irvine when the Baggies were a point above the relegation zone in January 2015, eventually leading them to 13th. They finished 14th in 2015-16 and came 10th last season but failed to win any of their final nine matches.
Pulis defended his record in a statement via the League Managers Association. “Over the last three seasons we have achieved a great deal and I am proud to have managed West Bromwich Albion,” he said. “I would like to thank the two owners, Jeremy Peace and Mr Lai, the board and fans for their support during my time at West Brom. Jeremy Peace and Mr Lai have played an important role in the off-field success and given the team a platform to build from.
“My remit was to develop the squad and ensure we delivered results which would in turn improve the club’s financial position. We have achieved this year on year and I am pleased to have played a part in the club’s growth. Our final league position in the last three seasons has represented the accomplishment of our targets as a club; sustaining our status in the Premier League and delivering stability, throughout the club’s transition of ownership.”


David Haye has been forced to postpone his rematch with Tony Bellew after tearing his biceps during training. The injury‑prone heavyweight, 37, has withdrawn from the match-up scheduled for 17 December at London’s O2 Arena but is not considering retirement and hopes to fight his rival on 24 March or 5 May instead.
“I am devastated to announce my much-anticipated rematch against Tony Bellew has been postponed until March 25 or May 5, subject to scheduling,” Haye said. “Despite the recent injury rumours, I was in perfect condition with an incredibly strong training camp, weighing lighter than I have for more than five years, I couldn’t wait to get back in the ring. I was ready to rewrite the ending of the Haye-Bellew saga.”
What Haye described as a “freak accident” occurred last Thursday, and led to a procedure on Monday afternoon that he said had been successful.
“After a freak accident during a stair conditioning session, which I’ve done with no incident hundreds of times, I lost my footing and slipped,” he said.
“So I instinctively grabbed the banister to stop myself toppling down the stairwell and in doing so I somehow managed to damage my biceps in the process.
“I underwent a procedure to repair it; this was pretty straightforward and my doctor and physiotherapist have no doubt that not only will I make a full recovery but will be able to be back in the gym to start my arm rehabilitation in two weeks.
“I would like to apologise to Tony, his family and his training team, as well as all our fans who have been left disappointed.”


The Fiver almost spat its Purple Tin out when it heard Tony Pulis had been at West Brom for only three years. Three years! Time moves slower than Dimitar Berbatov tracking back when Pulis is in charge. As well as the rubbish results, his lack of style is why he found himself staring forlornly at a collection of sports caps and tracksuit tops on Monday morning instead of taking a training session in which Gareth McAuley blooters a ball towards Dudley and Salomón Rondón and Jay Rodriguez take it in turns to chase it. Even Pulis knows he’s sucked the boing out of the Baggies.
It’s the reason he turned up to his pre-match press conference last Friday armed with a list of his West Brom highlights which included: not having been relegated, not having been relegated, not having been relegated and, um, not having been relegated. He also pointed out that it’s not fair to call his team boring when nine goals have been scored in the last two homes games. Given that seven of them were scored by Manchester City and Chelsea, that particular highlight was reminiscent of Weird Uncle Fiver arguing his case for a mortgage by pointing out how exciting his financial arrangements with a vicious loan shark were. Add to that the £40m he spent this summer in addition to signing the coveted Grzegorz Krychowiak on loan from PSG, and it’s clear that Pulis’s season high should have been more than a 1-1 draw at Leicester that led to Craig Shakespeare being hoofed out of the King Power.
“These decisions are never taken lightly but always in the interests of the club,” honked Baggies chairman John Williams as he shut and triple-bolted the door behind him. “We are in a results business and over the back end of last season and this season to date, ours have been very disappointing.” That’s some understatement. West Brom haven’t won a game since beating Accrington Stanley in the Rumbelows Cup in August, and most people think they’re made up. With the trees almost bare and Christmas on the horizon, that’s quite some time ago.
Still, one man backing Pulis for a comeback in the near future is his old drinking pal Pep Guardiola. “Whenever we played West Bromwich he was an amazing man, so gentle,” cooed Pep, to the distant sound of James Beattie guffawing. “We drank red wine and hopefully we can do it again in the future.” If they do, perhaps Pulis will tell Pep how, in some ways, the Spaniard is responsible for his demise. By introducing a brand of football into the Premier League that looks like it’s been beamed in from the year 2050, even if Pulis tried to be expansive it would look like he’d just devoured John Beck’s big book o’tactics.
The good news for Pulis is that for a very short time he may well be made to look mildly creative. With the club a point and a place above the relegation zone and facing Spurs at Wembley on Saturday, Gary Megson has been upgraded from assistant to caretaker. That’s Gary Megson who used to berate his players with shouts of “blousey, mummy-daddy” football if they dared string more than a couple of passes together and who was sacked by West Brom 13 years ago for failing his own style test. If history repeats itself, Pulis can look forward to a triumphant return at the Hawthorns in 2030. Fashion comes and goes. The sports cap will have its day again. Mark the date Baggies fans.

Our French duo on the rise of Amiens.
And Paolo Bandini reports on a weekend in Italy in which they started to get over their World Cup-knack.
Oh, and if it’s your thing … you can follow Big Website on Big Social FaceSpace. And INSTACHAT, TOO!


At first glance, Amiens do not seem equipped to be a Ligue 1 club. They have never won a major trophy; this is their first season in the top flight in 116 years; and their pokey Stade de la Licorne would not look out of place in League Two. Nevertheless, their upward trajectory has been close to vertical in recent times. They finished third in the Championnat National, France’s third division, in 2015-16 and earned their second successive promotion 12 months later by finishing as runners up in Ligue 2. Their latest triumph came on Friday night, when they drew 1-1 with the champions Monaco.
France’s third division is a true footballing backwater. Not even considered fully professional, nearly half of the league’s average gates have dropped into the hundreds this season. Unsurprisingly, stories of clubs ascending through the divisions – like Hull City in England or Paderborn in Germany – are rare. Amiens are the archetypal National club, provincial and comparatively sparsely supported.
However, low expectations and minimal funds have never been problems for their manager, Christophe Pélissier. In 2007 Pélissier took the reins at Luzenac, a club from the sleepy Pyrenees town with a population of little more than 600 playing in CFA2, French football’s sprawling fifth tier. Seven years later, having been close to extinction in that time, Luzenac were bound for Ligue 2. A murky decision by France’s overly aggressive financial watchdog denied the club a momentous promotion due to concerns over their stadium. Luzenac lost their professional status and their manager. “To leave like this after a remarkable season was really hard to bear. The word ‘mourning’ may be strong, but we have been deeply affected by this,” said Pélissier.
Pelissier eclipsed his success with Luzenac when he took Amiens to Ligue 1 in the most dramatic way imaginable. There was a six-way battle for a promotion spot on the last day of the season and Amiens clinched it when Emmanuel Bourgaud scored a 96th-minute winner against Reims. The club’s president, Bernard Joannin, said before the game he had given the country’s new president, Amiens native Emmanuel Macron, a signed shirt that had brought them both luck.
Pélissier has remained loyal to the players who won consecutive promotions. When Amiens beat Nice 3-0 in August – their first ever victory in the top-flight – Bourgaud was one of six players on the pitch who had also turned out for the club in their final match in the third tier.
Defensive solidarity has been key both last season and this. After some shaky early displays, Régis Gurtner is proving to be the assured and commanding goalkeeper every promoted side needs. Khaled Adénon marshals a thrifty backline that boasts a defensive record superior to that of Lyon, Marseille and St Étienne with just 14 goals conceded in 12 games. And the captain, Thomas Monconduit, completes the defensive spine at the base of the midfield. The 26-year-old’s composure, stamina and range of passing stand out now in the way they did in the lower divisions. All three men are veterans of the National promotion campaign.
The headline arrival in the summer was Gaël Kakuta and he has rapidly become the side’s talisman
Although he relies on a handful of lieutenants, Pélissier has proven he can reinvent and remould his side despite having minimal resources and a relatively high turnover in some areas of the squad. Jonathan Tinhan was the team’s top scorer when he was sold to rivals Troyes last winter. Aboubakar Kamara, his successor, moved to Fulham (where he has attempted to reinvent himself as “AK-47”) upon promotion. The teenage midfield powerhouse and the club’s biggest asset, Tanguy Ndombélé, joined Lyon this summer and his partner in midfield, Guessouma Fofana, broke his leg in training in August and is likely to be out all season. All four losses could have proven significant potholes, but Pélissier and his staff have shown an ability to cultivate their squad.
Amiens lost their first three games of the season without scoring a goal and the weak performance against Angers in particular drew worrying parallels with the lowly Troyes of 2015-16 or Arles-Avignon in 2010-11. But summer signings have proven crucial to their continued success. The South African enforcer Bongani Zungu and stoic centre-back Prince Gouano arrived, as is fashionable in France, from Portugal. Both have proved crucial to Amiens’ aggressive, bulky, counterattacking style. The full-back Issa Cissokho, journeyman midfielder Mathieu Bodmer and Lacina Traoré, Monaco’s top scorer as recently as two seasons ago, have added crucial Ligue 1 experience. The Senegal forward Moussa Konaté, who joined from Sion, and winger Serge Gakpé, who has returned to France after excursions in Serie A with Chievo and Genoa, have added attacking quality. Pélissier brought in 15 players in the summer, with only a few leaving. Unusually for a promoted side, Amiens have genuine strength in depth, so much so that Pélissier has bemoaned a need to keep each member of his unwieldy squad happy.
The headline arrival in the summer was Gaël Kakuta. Still only 26, Kakuta’s failure to establish himself in England preceded undulating form in Spain before self-imposed exile in China. But for Pélissier, adept at maximising talent, Kakuta has rapidly become the side’s talisman. He gave a standout display in the draw with Monaco on Friday, when Amiens came close to winning through Gakpé’s goal before Steven Jovetic scored an equaliser.
Nevertheless, Amiens are still a long way from survival. Their draw with Monaco still leaves them in the bottom three, but 12 points from their first 12 matches should be considered a productive start given how much the squad has changed. The signs are good. The Monaco game was their fifth consecutive match without defeat, while their play is starting to morph from overtly defensive to being bold on the break and confident in their use of the ball. And, despite being 19th, they remain just four points from the top half.
As Monaco found out on Friday night, Amiens are a tight, bold, effective unit. As Péllissier finally takes the applause his inspirational management deserves, his eclectic group of third division veterans, foreign unknowns and forgotten gems could have the right mix to surpass expectations once again.
• It was another missed opportunity for Toulouse on Saturday at the Stade Municipal against bottom side Metz. Despite playing for almost 70 minutes against the 10 men of the league’s worst defence, the hosts failed to breach Thomas Didillon’s goal and had to settle for a scoreless draw. The youngster made a fine save at close range from Christopher Jullien and Yaya Sanogo struck the bar, but Toulouse can have only themselves to blame after such a disappointing result. More worrying is that this result seems to be part of a larger trend. After a bright start to the season, Toulouse have scored just four goals in the league since August – and they are bottom of the division in that category. A solid defence (only Montpellier have a better record in that time) has kept relegation at bay but one might begin to wonder if that same defence, many of whom were the subject of transfer rumours in the summer, may want to leave the club if the attack can’t provide a realistic shot at European football. Still just three points off Caen in sixth, there is time for the team’s attack to coalesce, and a return to form from Max Gradel, who has struggled with injury, could yet prove key in this regard. Still, if results don’t improve soon, Pascal Dupraz could find himself under pressure despite his achievements to date.
• Lyon were similarly feckless at home on Sunday, delivering a scoreless draw against Montpellier. There is little shame in the result in isolation, as Michel Der Zakarian has quietly moulded his team into France’s most defensively sound one, but coming as it did with Ellyes Skhiri and Daniel Congré absent, it was particularly frustrating, especially as Monaco had dropped points; a win for Lyon would have moved them to within a point of the champions, who play Paris Saint-Germain on Sunday. Lyon will have a chance for revenge in the Coupe de la Ligue next month but the result shows that, despite their thumping win over Troyes without Nabil Fékir, Lyon are still too reliant on their captain. As Lyon come into the cup competitions in the next six weeks and look set to continue their Europa League campaign, Bruno Génésio must work on setting out a side that can be as imperious even without their talisman. Fékir is their leader and focal point in attack, but too often Lyon’s team play suffers in his absence, and that was in evidence again on Sunday as Memphis Depay, Maxwel Cornet and even the normally unselfish Houssem Aouar were all guilty of trying to do too much. Lyon have all the weapons to push Monaco for second place but there is still much work to be done.
Results: Lille 3-1 St Étienne, Amiens 1-1 Monaco, PSG 4-1 Nantes, Dijon 3-1 Troyes, Guingamp 1-1 Angers, Strasbourg 2-1 Rennes, Toulouse 0-0 Metz, Caen 1-1 Nice, Lyon 0-0 Montpellier, Bordeaux 1-1 Marseille


It seems fair to say sports documentary films reached something of an early artistic end-point with 1971’s Football As Never Before, a feature-length George Best portrait by the West German arthouse director Hellmuth Costard – best known for his 1968 work Especially Valuable, which featured a talking penis quoting passages of government legislation.
Presented without voiceover or soundtrack, Football As Never Before is an hour and 45 minutes of a single camera following its star around the pitch during a Manchester United game against Coventry City. Whatever its ultimate merits – and FANB does provide an absolute gold standard in mesmeric closeup shots focused, for long periods, entirely on George Best’s buttocks – the film also speaks to a more basic confusion over what exactly to do with sport on camera.
In outline it looks a simple enough relationship. Film-makers are always desperate for stories. Sport presents endless stories – a continual overblown operetta of glory, hubris and pantomime colour. The question has always been how to translate this self-contained world into a coherent whole, while also justifying a subject many viewers would perhaps consider a little beneath the threshold, a little limited, a little too much like, well, sport.
This might explain why, for so long, so few people bothered. The early history of sports documentaries takes in isolated sparks of arthouse brilliance, from FANB to gems such as A Sunday in Hell, a portrait of the Paris-Roubaix cycling race directed by the Danish poet Jørgen Leth.
Beyond this lies the other extreme, the epic official films made by Fifa and the IOC of successive postwar World Cup and Olympic Games, their extraordinary acts and oppositions offered up without apology or even much explanation. They’re as far from arthouse George Best as you’re likely to get, but present this world with an equally narrow eye.
The rise of Big Sport as a glossy mainstream entertainment product was always likely to drag sport stories out into the wider culture. Hoop Dreams was a breakthrough, a 1994 US film about junior basketball players that tells a gripping story of poverty, talent and anxiety. Around the same time, the UK was presented with the startling spectacle of An Impossible Job, the access-all-areas film about the sustained mental collapse and grim, kindly dignity of England manager Graham Taylor during the failed 1994 World Cup qualification campaign.
Still, sport documentaries tended to know their place, concerned above all with broadening out, putting in context, explaining their own relevance. The ESPN 30 for 30 series provided a beautifully spun template of sporting documentary as wider social commentary. Feature films began to follow. Senna captured both its subject and its time. Zidane: A 21st-Century Portrait recycled Costard’s George Best treatment, albeit in more pompous and highfalutin fashion. One Night in Turin, a documentary on the 1990 World Cup, based around the wonderful Pete Davis book All Played Out, provided a fun, rollicking football-as-pop-culture template that has been energetically mined ever since.
Never more so than now. This month two new feature-length footballing documentaries have been released. 89 tells the story of Arsenal’s dramatic, last-ditch 1989 league title victory. Kenny is about former Liverpool player and manager Kenny Dalglish. Both are notable for two things. First, neither spends any time explaining itself or apologising for being there, and both are all the better for it. This is the third wave of sports docs, beyond arthouse, beyond social commentary; sports film qua sports film, free to come swaggering in through the front door with their own self-contained story to tell.
This leads on to the second thing about Kenny and 89: the two films are basically telling the same story, albeit from opposing points of view. Both are about that strange, febrile in-between time just before this world became modern, when professional football was still a frontier town of genuine extremes and un-homogenised glory, still not quite a product.
Both are, whether 89 needs to say it or not, about the decline of the industrial north. And both are pegged out around the same central event – the Hillsborough disaster in April 1989 that saw 96 people die during and after an FA Cup semi-final, the result of systemic institutional failings by those in charge. Both films are entwined around Hillsborough, even if 89 tells an entirely different story. Both are moving, moreish and slickly put together, all the more so when seen as a pair.
89 is the more niche, the story of a league title sealed by the narrowest possible margin with a last-minute Friday-night 2-0 victory at the home of all-conquering Liverpool. In 89 this is pitched as a kind of heist, a Dirty Dozen-type scenario, with Arsenal’s youthful, fun underdogs entering the citadel of one of the century’s great club teams to win their first title in 18 years.
There is a natural chutzpah to all this: travelling up daringly late on the day of the game; the dramatic tactical switch to a back three; and above all, the emotional heart of the film, the wonderful bond between the club’s core of young players, current and future. David Rocastle was 22 when Arsenal produced their title snatch, a gloriously composed and charming athlete from south-east London. Rocastle was a mentor to the younger Ian Wright at that time, stopping him when they met on the Brockley estates and urging him to give up smoking weed and concentrate on his football talent. In the film Wright breaks down in tears remembering this. He signed for Arsenal two years later and went on to become the club’s record goalscorer. Rocastle died in 2001 and is much missed.
Otherwise 89 is the usual retro feast of period details, all enjoyably grainy screen-dissolves and cool clunky graphics. Look! A dork with a big mobile phone! Men on the trading floor in stripy jackets! Maggie Thatcher saying something! Old beige cars! Ride on Time! Pump Up the Jam! Etc!
The film has amazing access. Everyone talks, although at times there is a slight sense that watching old blokes bantering and playing cards could make way for a glimpse of something else, perhaps a sniff of the darkness most evident in the figure of the former alcoholic Tony Adams.
Adams is a star of the film, an extravagantly tailored, sightly eccentric figure these days, rolling his eyes and twirling his Victorian bow tie and reeling off a series of asides that might have led this film into other areas. The assorted club legends Adams and co replaced in the Arsenal back four were “pretty selfish individuals” he says. Wait. What? “We wanted success, and we’d do anything to get it, because it made us feel … better,” Adams concludes with a wicked, loopy grin, the grin of a man who knows a bit about trying to feel better. But we get no further with this.
The other notable point in 89 is the absence of voices from the Liverpool side. I asked Amy Lawrence, one of the film’s producers, about this. She explained that an editorial decision was made to tell the story from one side only. The reason was Hillsborough, which happened just five weeks before that night at Anfield. The disaster is acknowledged and detailed in the film, which is dedicated to the Hillsborough dead. But in this company it would have completely taken over the narrative, turned the film into another film entirely. Instead 89 pays its respects and moves on, without ever quite losing the imprint of that potent absence.
And, for all the obvious Arsenal glory, the wider story here is the collapse of Liverpool, a period of trauma that signalled the falling away of one of the great club football dynasties. Liverpool stormed back and won the league by a mile the following year. But they haven’t won it since. The recovery period has been long and painful.
There’s a funny moment at the end as George Graham, Arsenal’s tough, likable Scottish manager, tries to calm everyone down in the moment of triumph, telling them to stop shouting and leaping about. “That was stupid, I don’t know what I was doing,” Graham laughs now. But maybe he did. For all the glory that night was also the passing of something.
At which point, enter Kenny, another beautifully framed football film that is told entirely from the other side. Kenny Dalglish was the Liverpool manager opposite Graham on the night 89 describes. He looked absolutely shot in that film: wrung out, drained, propped up by his own padded sports coat. Kenny tells us why.
Dalglish was first of all a wonderful footballer, one of the three greatest in England – along with Thierry Henry and Cristiano Ronaldo – in this observer’s lifetime. Career highlights aside, Kenny is a sombre film, if only because his has been a life with more than its share of grief and sorrow.
As a player Dalglish was at Heysel, the stadium disaster caused by rushing Liverpool fans that killed 29 Italians. He’d been present as a fan 14 years earlier at the Ibrox stadium disaster, which killed 66 people. And of course he was at Hillsborough. The final half hour of the film is where it shifts to another gear, telling the story of the remarkable part played by Dalglish and his wife, Marina, in helping to steer Liverpool through a tragedy inflicted, essentially, by the viciousness of the 1980s in many areas of public life.
Dalglish had this thrust upon him, becoming a face of the Hillsborough aftermath, called upon to provide wisdom and solace and a sense of institutional care when the state would not. His constancy in this role has been dad-like, laconic but unconditional.
Indeed, watching the Hillsborough footage we’re reminded that Dalglish’s son Paul was in the crowd; the manager’s anxiety was personal as well as public. Dalglish addresses the crowd over the tannoy at one point. Paul, lost in the mayhem, hears him and comes to the tunnel in some distress. ”And then he was there, just there,” Paul marvels, 28 years later, because dads are magical.
There is more of this kind of thing in the pipeline. Forthcoming sports docs include a film about Diego Maradona directed by Senna’s Asif Kapadia, and Netflix and Amazon series about Juventus and Manchester City, respectively. Perhaps, in time, the last few years might even come to be seen as a golden era for the straight-up sports doc, a cinematic age when so many of the best stories were harvested.
From a commercial angle it isn’t hard to see why so many are being made. For a start, sports documentaries are cheap. There is a formulaic ease to knocking together another ready-made plot, with ready-made footage and a ready-made audience. And let’s face it, many of these stories are only being told because of grey-pound nostalgia. In an age when Premier League grounds are packed out by middle-aged disposable income, sporting docs tend to tell the story of a certain time, of vanished youth.
On the other hand, maybe the nostalgia is justified. As 89 and Kenny demonstrate, football’s immediate pre-modern era was a time when grand, sweeping stories were still allowed to happen – before sport was commodified and processed, when the world still felt human-scale and recognisable, and where the eye is understandably still drawn.


One of the most compelling images in tennis during the closing decade of this century was one born of loss. In the 1993 Wimbledon women’s singles final, and leading 4-1 in the third set, Jana Novotna dramatically crumpled to defeat against Steffi Graf and then, unable to contain her emotions, wept lingeringly on the shoulder of the Duchess of Kent.
Four years later Novotna was on Wimbledon’s Centre Court again, losing in three sets to the 16-year-old Swiss Martina Hingis. No tears this time, but playful resignation masking her disappointment as she snatched the silver rosewater dish away from Hingis and made as if to run off with it.
Despite the fact that she had been told by her royal comforter: “Don’t worry. I am sure it will be third time lucky”, it was generally felt that Novotna had visited her last duchess.
The 1993 image of a heartbroken loser choking on her despair seemed one that would forever epitomise Novotna’s career, and she would be destined to be remembered as one of the finest women’s players, particularly on grass, never to win a grand slam title.
This year had opened in Australia with Hingis, the world’s No1, and like Novotna born in the old Czechoslovakia, winning the Australian Open title, thereby setting in motion what was expected to be a season dominated by the bright young things – Hingis, the two Williams sisters, Venus and Serena, and Russia’s Anna Kournikova.
Four-one up in the final set against Steffi Graf, Jana Novotna was poised to pull off one of Centre Court's great upsets when she served for the point to go a further game ahead and, in all likelihood, beyond the reach of her opponent. It was a second serve and, sensing this was her moment, Novotna strained to put Graf's return under pressure. The result was a double fault and Graf went on to break serve. Just over 20 minutes later, they were shaking hands. Novotna had failed to win another game. 
The shock of her collapse finally struck as she collected her runner's-up medal from the Duchess of Kent. 'I wanted to handle myself well,' she said later, 'but when she smiled at me I just let go.' As she wept, Novotna was consoled by the Duchess. 'Don't worry Jana,' she said. 'I know you can do it.' Indeed, she did. Five years later, she was Wimbledon champion
There is no record of the crinklies (ie any player over 20) gathering around a boiling cauldron and tossing in the odd fillet of snake or newt’s eye, but by the time the final at Roland Garros was reached the teenies had fallen under the spell of what may be politely referred to as the more mature players.
Novotna fans may have also taken heart from Petr Korda’s victory in the men’s final at Melbourne. Another renowned under-achiever, the 30-year-old Czech defeated Chile’s Marcelo Rios for his first grand slam title.
The choker turned joker was now a grand slam winner. There was no more heart-warming resolution to a tennis final
Novotna had noted the comments of the younger players on the Tour, recognised their innate confidence, and determined to push herself to the limits in order to match their hunger for success.
Three years ago, her father’s illness persuaded her that she was taking tennis too seriously. “I started to enjoy myself more. In the past people thought I was not a nice person because I didn’t talk a lot. Lately the misconceptions have changed, which is incredibly important to me.” And her father has recovered. Novotna now admits to being totally unprofessional when she was in her late teens, and recognises the current dilemma facing Hingis. “She’s not as devoted to her tennis as she used to be. She wants to do different things, which is fine, but she has to find the time to dedicate herself to tennis too.”
The contrast in their Wimbledon preparation was significant. Novotna arrived two weeks in advance, winning both the singles and doubles titles at Eastbourne. Meanwhile Hingis had a holiday in the Alps, went to a World Cup game in France, shot a shampoo commercial, and then arrived in London just four days before Wimbledon began.
In the quarter-finals Novotna, the third seed, defeated Venus Williams 7-5, 7-6 and then beat Hingis, the holder, 6-4, 6-4 in the semis. “Jana showed more experience and, above all, maturity,” said a former champion, Chris Evert.
Yet had America’s Lindsay Davenport, the No2 seed then, and now the current world No1, won against France’s Nathalie Tauziat, seeded 16, in the other semi-final, the supporters of Novotna would have surely entered the Centre Court with considerably more trepidation.
Even the bookies, men whose souls are stripped of sentiment, had the 29-year-old Novotna marked down as the overwhelming 1-6 favourite against Tauziat, while quoting a miserly 2-1 for a Czech straight-sets win. Virginia Wade, champion in 1977, but with a similar record of frailty under extreme pressure, pronounced that “Nathalie can’t win”.
This had nothing do to with the 30-year-old Frenchwoman’s own temperament or ability, rather that a Novotna victory now seemed pre-ordained.
Inevitably there were moments of anxiety for Novotna. She was broken in her opening service game, and although the break-back came quickly the tension was palpable every time the Czech served.
Having taken the first set 6-4, Novotna led 2-0 in the second set only to be hauled back to 5-5. The “Oh no, not again, Jana” pessimists squinted anxiously through their fingers.
“What’s all the fuss about. I told you last year you would come back and win,” said the Duchess afterwards, and the next day, men’s final day, Novotna and her mother, Liba, could be seen wandering around the players’s area linked by arm and beatific smiles, their feet scarcely touching the ground.
And yes, winning Wimbledon was “my dream come true” and everything from now on is “icing on the cake”. The cliches were forgivable for every tennis fan could see her emotions and relate to them – just has they had done in 1993 in quite different circumstances.
The choker turned joker was now a grand slam winner, as befitted her talent. There was no more heart-warming resolution to a tennis final all year.


It was a weekend for gallows humour in Italy. “Goals from [Ciro] Immobile and [Lorenzo] Insigne yesterday,” tweeted the wags from Chiamarsi Bomber on Sunday. “So we qualified, right?”
In truth, it will take a lot more than a week for a nation to digest its World Cup play-off defeat to Sweden. Gian Piero Ventura was fired as manager of the Azzurri last week, and the Football Federation president Carlo Tavecchio resigned on Monday amid reports that his support base had crumbled.
Change is necessary after a calamitous qualifying campaign, but that alone will not assuage the anger and disappointment of supporters as they face up to a first World Cup without Italy in six decades. Likewise, even the most entertaining round of Serie A fixtures could only serve as a temporary distraction. Still, what a distraction it turned out to be.
The schedule was always alluring. A weekend that began with the first Rome derby of this campaign – and the first of the post-Francesco Totti era – would proceed through Napoli-Milan and Sampdoria-Juventus before finishing up with Inter-Atalanta on Sunday night. Not one of Italy’s top seven sides could look forward to an easy ride.
Roma took the derby, Radja Nainggolan stealing the headlines after he capped a swaggering performance with the second goal in a 2-1 win. Eyebrows were raised back in Belgium. The midfielder had cited a groin lesion as he pulled out of friendlies against Mexico and Japan, just days after being recalled to the national team by Roberto Martínez.
Eusebio Di Francesco scoffed at suggestions of a falsified injury, instead hailing Nainggolan’s powers of recovery as he described the player as a “superhero” and a “true Ninja”. The rest of us might reserve some praise for the Roma manager himself. This is ever more a team in Di Francesco’s image: ultra-aggressive with a targeted press that forced Lazio into errors just as it had Fiorentina and Chelsea in recent weeks.
Napoli won by an identical scoreline, though for the more patriotic fan this victory might well have been laced with regret. Insigne, granted just 15 minutes of Italy’s two-legged play-off against Sweden, ran this show from the get-go. He served José Callejón with a beautiful cross just before the quarter-hour mark only for the Spaniard’s back-post header to be pawed away by the keeper. Insigne then opened the scoring himself, VAR confirming that he had timed his run just right to spring Milan’s offside trap before finishing from the edge of the box.
A further potential assist was lost when Dries Mertens failed to convert a one-on-one. Instead Piotr Zielinski eventually grabbed Napoli’s second, before Alessio Romagnoli scored one of the best consolation goals you are likely to see from a centre-half.
Insigne refused to be drawn into criticising Ventura at full-time, insisting that he was “more disappointed not to go to the World Cup than not to play against Sweden”. Maurizio Sarri, likewise, was reluctant to speak ill of a coaching colleague, though he did observe that his own experiences had steered him to a point where he would never sacrifice talent to tactical principle. When a reporter asked whether he might consider the Italy job, the Napoli manager joked that he would sooner run for parliament. Why would he leave the Partenopei now, as they sit top of Serie A? Their hold on first place would only be strengthened a day later, as Juventus fell to a 3-2 defeat at Sampdoria.
Even that scoreline was deceiving. Juventus had trailed 3-0 in the 90th minute, decimated by a second-half salvo. Samp took fewer shots and held a smaller share of possession, yet they were concrete in all the ways that their opponents weren’t. The opening goal offered a glimpse of the game in microcosm. Fabio Quagliarella crossed from the right for Sampdoria, Federico Bernardeschi attempted to clear with a needless overhead kick inside his own penalty area and the ball looped over to Duván Zapata at the back post. The Colombian took his chance with aplomb.
Lucas Torreira drilled home a satisfying second from inside the D, before Gian Marco Ferrari slipped home the third from close range. The crowd at Marassi were delirious. Sampdoria have been flawless in their own stadium this season: winning six out of six home games, as well as the derby – technically an away game – against Genoa.
By full-time on Sunday, their manager, Marco Giampaolo, was being touted as a potential winner of the 2018 Panchina d’Oro (Golden Bench). Sixth in the table – and only five points behind Juventus, with a game in hand – his team were being discussed as legitimate Champions League contenders.
Giampaolo wanted no part of either conversation. He was too busy enjoying his first ever victory against Juventus: a team he had faced 10 times in his managerial career without taking so much as a point. “I’m not thinking about any particular targets,” he insisted. “I enjoy teaching the lads a particular movement and then taking the pleasure that comes when they apply it better than I taught it.”
That mentality helps to explain why he has been such a good fit at Samp. Giampaolo is a coach who enjoys getting into the details, working with individual players on the little things that make them better. A youthful midfield has flourished under his guidance. Torreira, on this form, may yet demand the consideration of the Uruguay manager, Óscar Tabárez, for next summer’s World Cup.
Juventus, for their part, slipped to third, after Mauro Icardi’s brace propelled Inter to victory over Atalanta. It is not that reality, nor the four-point gap to Napoli that ought to concern the reigning champions so much as the 10 goals they have now conceded in six away games. Their manager, Massimiliano Allegri, had reflected on the World Cup play-off at his pre-match press conference, observing that: “The Italian is full of pride. Normally when these things happen, he knows how to pick himself up and start over.”
With a Champions League showdown against Barcelona coming up on Wednesday night, he had better hope that the same goes for his own team.
• It would have been remiss of me not to sign off with a mention for poor Benevento, who became the first team across Europe’s top five leagues ever to lose 13 games to begin a new season. It is not the statistic itself, but the way they have reached it that demands attention. They thought they had claimed their first Serie A point a month ago, when they equalised in the 93rd-minute away to Cagliari. Somehow, on that occasion, they contrived to concede another goal seconds later.

This weekend brought fresh indignity. At home to Sassuolo, they fell behind on a goalkeeping blunder – with Alberto Brignoli passing the ball directly to an opponent – before pulling level midway through the second half. Benevento then had a right-back Gaetano Letizia sent off, but clung on until the 92nd minute, when they gave away a penalty on an Andrea Costa handball.
The story does not end here. Domenico Berardi crashed the spot-kick against the bar, granting the home support a moment to believe that their luck might finally have turned. That feeling can only have been reinforced when Brignoli pushed a header from a free-kick wide a minute later. And then, the ensuing corner was sent in from the right. Federico Peluso rose in the middle to head home – and condemn Benevento to yet another defeat.
Results: Benevento 1-2 Sassuolo, Crotone 0-1 Genoa, Internazionale 2-0 Atalanta, Sampdoria 3-2 Juventus, SPAL 1-1 Fiorentina, Torino 1-1 Chievo, Udinese 0-1 Cagliari. Saturday: Roma 2-1 Lazio, Napoli 2-1 Milan.


“It doesn’t matter who scores the goals,” said Max Kruse on Thursday, and it sounded like he believed it. Yet even if it doesn’t quite mean everything, it means a lot. That much was evident after he retired to the bench a few minutes from the end from Werder Bremen’s emphatic 4-0 win over Hannover on Sunday, their first of the season, having hit a hat-trick – his first goals of the season. Kruse goofed around, whooping and pulling faces at the television cameras. The supporters’ relief was palpable. Not just at the result, but at their star forward taking centre stage again.
Kruse reiterated that idea of the collective afterwards, saying he was “even happier about the team’s performance” than he was about his contribution, and the others certainly put in a shift. Nobody in the Bundesliga, for example, ran more than midfielder Maximilian Eggestein’s 13.4km this weekend, with Kicker labelling him the “Kilometer-König”.
Yet this was all about Kruse. It was his perfectly judged pass that sliced open the Hannover defence for Fin Bartels to lift in the opener, and though Werder again played with renewed enterprise under their interim coach Florian Kohfeldt (this was his first home game after marshalling the team’s trip to Eintracht Frankfurt before the international break), they wobbled at the beginning of the second period. It took a good stop from Jiri Pavlenka to keep out Martin Harnik, a close friend of Kruse since the days the pair played together for Werder’s second team over a decade ago.
After that, it was time for Kruse to get to work, classily curling in Philipp Bargfrede’s pass after he dispossessed Sebastian Maier. Another followed a few minutes later after the almost-as-impressive Bartels returned the compliment, and Kruse completed the hat-trick with a firm cross-shot. Having scored only three in a painful first 10 games of the season under Alexander Nouri, Werder have scored five in two games with his replacement Kohfeldt. The Proclaimers, whose anthem I’m Gonna Be (500 Miles) greets home goals at the Weserstadion, hadn’t worked this hard in a while. This, to borrow an oft-used phrase from the latest Jupp Heynckes era at Bayern Munich, felt like fun.
Grit, determination, pride and all that other stuff might be important, but the game being enjoyable matters too, and Kruse at his best is a huge step towards an afternoon at the Weser being that again. He might never be the model pro – and has been at pains to warn he is edging back towards peak condition gradually since making his comeback from injury at the end of October – but he is the type of player who can lift his team a little higher. He certainly did at the end of last season, scoring nine times in his last nine Bundesliga games of the campaign as Werder flirted with an unlikely European qualification.
It seems like a perfect storm at the moment, with Kruse getting back into that sort of nick and Kohfeldt having seemingly given the team a new lease of life. His predecessor Nouri had worked hard to engineerdefensive stability but when he finally got it, it was at the expense of attacking enterprise. The switch back to a more lively style has been pretty instant under Kohfeldt, and the board felt he showed enough in that first game in charge at Frankfurt – despite it ending in a last-gasp loss – to give him the job “at least” until the winter break.
For now, it’s enough, especially after a weekend in which rock-bottom Cologne and fellow strugglers Freiburg lost. As the feeling of relief dissipates, though, questions will be asked about the club’s long-term – and even medium-term – plan. The feeling Werder are good to watch since Kohfeldt arrived can’t completely erase the creeping sense of history repeating. He is the third successive coach promoted from the under-23 side to the senior team after Nouri and Viktor Skripnik. Their talents were respected and praised by the board. They both had spells of very good results. Both, when it went awry, were dispensed with, despite considerable histories with the club, which was back where it started.
The sporting director Frank Baumann, who has been under considerable pressure himself, gave a fairly robust defence of himself in an extensive weekend interview with regional newspaper Weser Kurier. He defended the appointment of Kohfeldt, of course. “There is no proof that a coach with 20 years of Bundesliga experience can master this situation better than a young [coach],” Baumann argued. “It’s about individual skills, not age.”
Baumann was even prodded to explain the way in which he announced that Kohfeldt was continuing in the job, after admitting he’d talked to other coaches before deciding there wasn’t anyone better out there. “I gave a very honest and open review of the coach search,” he said and probably wished he hadn’t.
Understandably, this has created a degree of scepticism about Kohfeldt’s appointment. So Kruse’s intervention was exactly what Baumann ordered – a healthy dollop of fantasy to push the more uncomfortable details to the back of the mind, for now. He’ll turn 30 in March, but made clear after Sunday’s game that he’d still love to be in the mix for Russia next summer.
That may sound fanciful, but so did a 4-0 win before kick-off. The longer Kruse, Bartels, Zlatko Junuzovic and company can keep reality from the door the better. For now – as they’re getting used to saying in Bremen.
• Bayern had a pretty good weekend, cruising past Augsburg (3-0) in their derby of sorts. The latest example of the Heynckes effect was Arturo Vidal, who opened the scoring, laid on Robert Lewandowski’s first and prowled midfield with real purpose. The coach wasn’t shy in taking the credit. “Two weeks ago,” Heynckes said afterwards, “I had a conversation with Arturo Vidal. I told him that I wasn’t satisfied with his physical shape and that he needed to change something, particularly if he wanted to be a starter. He didn’t agree but since then, he has been very good in training.” Is there any player he can’t straighten out?
• And no, your eyes do not deceive you – that is Schalke in second place behind Bayern after their 2-0 win over Hamburg on Sunday afternoon. It wasn’t a great watch, and Markus Gisdol’s side might feel aggrieved at ending up empty-handed (the HSV coach described the sides as “two evenly-matched teams” afterwards) but the Schalke manager Domenico Tedesco’s success so far has been all about substance, rather than style. It could be pointed out that S04 have only won only once against a top 10 side but the young coach’s success in getting them to continue to perform even without the injured Leon Goretzka and Nabil Bentaleb is noteworthy - plus Franco Di Santo scored his first Bundesliga goal since March 2016.
• Die Königsblauen will arrive at Borussia Dortmund for next Saturday’s Revierderby in optimistic mood – which is more than can be said for their hosts, who lost a fourth Bundesliga game in five at Stuttgart on Friday night. They actually played well after conceding a horrendous early goal – when Chadrac Akolo capitalised on a mix-up between Roman Bürki and Marc Bartra – and with Mario Götze on form, looked well set when Maximilian Philipp levelled. More shoddy defending allowed the substitute Josip Brekalo to put VfB back in front shortly after half-time, though, and BVB looked a disorganised rabble afterwards. It ended a pretty dire week in which Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang was suspended by the club for disciplinary reasons, and their vaunted head scout Sven Mislintat got set to leave for Arsenal. Monday’s Bild even claimed the coach Peter Bosz has two games left to save his job.
• Things are brighter at Borussia Mönchengladbach, who finished the weekend in the top four after a 4-2 win at Hertha Berlin following a lightning start in the capital, in which they scored three times in the first 20 minutes. As well as their attack clicking with Lars Stindl, Thorgan Hazard and Raffael – whose brace included one absolute rocket from range – impressing, they had a consequence-free wake-up call, with Hertha pulling the game back to 3-2 after a period their coach Dieter Hecking called “far too passive”. Gladbach face Bayern next.
• Leipzig fell a further two points off the pace, twice letting a lead slip in an entertaining 2-2 draw at Bayer Leverkusen despite benefitting from two penalties and playing most of the second half against 10 men after Benny Henrichs was sent off for handling on the goalline. Heiko Herrlich’s side actually came on stronger after going a man down, underlining one of Leipzig’s few remaining weaknesses - taking the initiative when placed in a dominant position. “The draw was the right outcome, even if it was two points lost,” admitted Leipzig’s goalkeeper Peter Gulacsi.
• Wolfsburg finally got out of their spiral of draws under new (ish) coach Martin Schmidt, beating fellow strugglers Freiburg to give him a maiden win, with Yunus Malli scoring twice. No respite for Cologne, who drew a blank again as they went down at Mainz. Peter Stöger will still be in charge for the games against Arsenal and Hertha, assured their managing director Alexander Wehrle – but, it seems, even the popular Stöger could have a limit on his tenure.
• Kevin-Prince Boateng’s goal for Eintracht Frankfurt at Hoffeheim would have deserved to win most games. It didn’t, as the last-minute goal specialists got a taste of their own medicine, with Mark Uth’s smart finish salvaging a point for Julian Nagelsmann’s team ahead of their European crunch at Braga on Thursday.
Results: Stuttgart 2-1 Borussia Dortmund, Bayer Leverkusen 2-2 RB Leipzig, Bayern Munich 3-0 Augsburg, Hoffenheim 1-1 Eintracht Frankfurt, Mainz 1-0 Cologne, Wolfsburg 3- Freiburg, Hertha Berlin 2-4 Borussia Mönchengladbach, Schalke 2-0 Hamburg, Werder Bremen 4-0 Hannover


Nolito says he was “joking”, which he often is, as another cheeky grin sweeps across his face and he starts laughing again. “Bloody hell,” he says, which is something he says a lot – or its slightly ruder Spanish equivalent anyway. And then he continues: “But it was for real, eh! I had to give her vitamin D, the poor thing. We’d go outside but the sun just never came out. Even I ended up pale …” A quick glance up and he adds, giggling: “Just like you!” And just like his daughter Lola, aged nine, and one‑year‑old twins, Lara and Alegría.
Towards the end of his first season in England, by which time he knew it would be his last, the former Manchester City player, now back in Spain with Liverpool’s Champions League opponents Sevilla, said his daughter had changed colour. “She looks like she’s been living in a cave,” he said then. He says now: “It got misinterpreted. It was just a joke, a throwaway line. And it was true: there was no sun and the paediatrician said: ‘Try this …’
“Maybe there are some people with no sense of humour but no City fan has ever heard me talking down Manchester. It has positive things but it is like that: at 5pm it’s dark and it’s cold, the philosophy of life is different. Why do lots of English come to Marbella? To Gibraltar? Even to my home town, Sanlúcar? They come, drink wine and eat jamón in their socks. They eat de puta madre, they live de puta madre, feel de puta madre.”
Roughly, de puta madre means effing fantastic, which is another thing he says a lot.
It is November in Seville, almost 2,000km south of Manchester, less than 100km from home, and Nolito is in a T-shirt. He says his daughter has got her colour back. Slowly he is getting his football back as well, or trying to. He talks about “feeling like a footballer again” but it is not easy when, through absence and injury, you have gone virtually seven months without playing. And when you are from Sanlúcar de Barrameda, where there are 1,500 hours of sunshine a year more than in Manchester, and a third as many rainy days, where the average temperature never drops to single figures, the north‑west can be quite a leap.
“That’s the principal problem: almost all footballers are people,” Nolito says. Almost all? There are some that aren’t? “Well,” he grins, “there’s a bit of everything on God’s earth. But, yeah, we’re people: every player has his story, things going on in his life, which is why I stopped reading things, listening. Comments hurt you and hurt your family. People can say: ‘That’s part of the job.’ Yeah, right, but being insulted isn’t part of the job. One day, I’ll retire and it’s the person who’s left.” For Nolito, the problem was that mostly there were not things going on – on or off the pitch.
If it gets dark at 5pm then at six it’s like it’s 10 o’clock and you even start to get tired
“We lived close to [David] Silva and to Edu, a physio friend who worked at City. We’d have lunch together, dinner at home, go down and have a coffee, but it didn’t quite work. If it gets dark at 5pm then at six it’s like it’s 10 o’clock and you even start to get tired. You think: ‘Bloody hell, it’s only six!’” At times, his brother came to visit, but that didn’t work either. “He didn’t hang around,” Nolito says, swiftly. “Three, four days and then …” He dusts off his hands. “‘Flight to Gibraltar!’ ‘Flight to Gibraltar!’ I was like: ‘Stick around. I’ll pay you, hahaha.’ Nah, it’s a joke, but even if I had offered it he wouldn’t have lasted 10 days. He was the same [when I was] in Vigo. He was used to life in Sanlúcar. He came to England three or four days, saw a nice game, and he was off, with the shirt.”
Unused, normally. Because while the lifestyle was different, it was the football that really decided Nolito’s destiny. “My daughter spoke English, so did my wife; I was the only one that didn’t, and I took classes with Jesús [Navas],” he says. “They adapted well; it was just a shame I didn’t play in the last few months.”
By mid-October Nolito had played nine times, scoring five and all seemed well. A regular starter, from his arrival to the end of the year he played 21 games; from the turn of the year he played nine, mostly as a sub. The League Cup tie against Huddersfield Town in February was the final time he started a match.
So, what happened? “You’d really have to ask the míster,” he says. “I arrived there full of hope, the best place in the world to play football. He called me, convinced me and in the beginning things worked well.
“The football surprised me at first: seeing a striker getting pulled all over the place by a big defender and the referee not giving anything. You see some hits …” Nolito makes a gesture that says: wallop! “Sometimes you know it’s coming and you can jump out the way but, if they catch you: phwwwww! Players dive and they’re strict on that but someone goes right through you and [there’s] nothing. But in the end, it’s still football. If you’re not happy because you haven’t adapted, that can transmit to the pitch but at the start I was happy and playing well.
“And then, suddenly, he clipped my wings a bit. It’s true that City are a very good team with very good players but I think I didn’t deserve those last four months. I deserved to play more. That’s my opinion but these things happen. When you go four or five games without playing – in the stands, on the bench, 20 minutes, no minutes – it’s a radical change. You think: ‘Bloody hell, what happened?’”
Did he ask? “No.” Why not? “Because. No words are needed. There’s not much you can ask that you don’t already know. If in 10 games you play three, you get the message.”
As Nolito talks and laughs and jokes, an idea forms. Has that personality counted against him? Is he seen as not serious enough? And is Pep Guardiola too serious? “Well, yes,” he says with a grin, “but that’s like lots of coaches. And, look, it’s not that I don’t take it seriously, [even if] I do take it differently: there are people who, if they don’t win, don’t eat. You have to eat, you’ve got to get up the next day. It saddens me that they suffer more than they need to because in the end it is a game.
You do things with [Guardiola] on the training ground you’ve never done and later think: ‘Bloody hell, he was right!’
“I am what I am: I love to attack and what I like the least is defending, haha! I [also] like a joke. But that doesn’t mean anything. When you have to pull on your work overalls, you do. No coach could ever say I haven’t worked hard, and never will. You can train happy or you can train sad or you can train bitter,” Nolito says, pulling a face. “You only live once.
Football’s there to be enjoyed. It can’t be that one day you are useless if you don’t score and the next day you’re a superstar if you do. I try to enjoy myself every time I play.”
There were few opportunities for enjoyment, Nolito watching the second half of his only season from the stands, his mind made up. By the time he watched City knocked out of the Champions League by Monaco – “the manager was destroyed and so were the players; maybe we didn’t have the intensity and desire we should have had that night, but they were flying” – the decision had long been taken. “I’ll always be grateful to Pep: he gave me my debut for Barcelona and signed me for City. I don’t know if he then changed his mind, if he didn’t think the way I thought, but I never had a problem with him and don’t now. I wish him the best, and the team.”
Now, watching from afar, he sees continuity in City’s model. But he sees change, too. Nolito learned and thinks Guardiola has learned, too. “You do things with him on the training ground you’ve never done and later think: ‘Bloody hell, he was right!’ Coaches sometimes just say: ‘That’s the way it is,’ and don’t explain. He’s the coach, right? But Pep would say: ‘This is how it is, because of this, this, this and this. And if you do it, then this is what’s going to happen.’ And often that’s exactly how it works. He’s a wizard, one of the best in the world easily.
“He was at Barcelona and they played effing fantastically. He’s been at Bayern. Then he went to England and perhaps the first year didn’t turn out so well. It’s not easy arriving there where it’s more physical, more intense, where they hit you harder. You give away one corner and they score. [For the players] it’s difficult to adapt to a new philosophy. If you’re 30, you think: ‘Bloody hell, I’ve never done that.’ It takes time but, bit by bit, they changed and now they’re flying. The míster is very stubborn, very headstrong and they have to do what he wants. [But] I think he’s adapted to English football, too. I’m not in his head but maybe he’s realised you have to be stronger, quicker. You see that in signings like [Kyle] Walker and [Benjamin] Mendy.”
Yet it is Kevin De Bruyne who has most stood out for many – if not for Nolito. “He’s a magnificent player: he scores goals, works hard, has everything. He’s young but is one of the best in the league. If you make me choose, though, I’m going for Silva,” he says.
“Silva is a magician and he’s underrated,” Nolito says. “He doesn’t get the praise he deserves. People don’t talk about him, others get raved about more. If he was English maybe it would be different. But I think Silva’s the best in the Premier League. He doesn’t score the most goals but what he does every week no other player does. There are players who are powerful, quick, strong, but they don’t do what Silva does. They can’t move as if the ball’s tied to their boot. They don’t have that calmness, that pass.”
Maybe Silva’s low profile goes against him; the fact that he doesn’t appear to be a leader? “He’s an effing great guy, who looks after his friends,” Nolito says. “And a great team-mate too. He keeps himself to himself. Maybe he doesn’t want to be leader but he has all the qualities. And he’s the best in the Premier League without receiving the recognition – without doubt.” Do City lack leaders? “No,” Nolito says, laughing. “The leader is the míster. The leader is Pep Guardiola. He is in charge. And that’s enough leadership …” He laughs again, another true word said in jest?
It would be tempting to watch City succeed now, to see them top, to miss Silva and question the decision to go. After all, they are, in Nolito’s words, like “motorbikes” right now. But he insists that is not his case nor has he given up on a place in Spain’s World Cup squad or the Champions League final. He says he would pay to be there and face City, joking as he starts the bidding at “50,000 euros ... 100,000 euros”.
“It was good, the experience was good but the decision to leave was made a long time back and I don’t regret coming here. I’m grateful to have had the opportunity to play in the Premier League at a great club but I wasn’t playing and I wanted to play. Now I feel like another player at Sevilla. I’m close to home and I want to get back to the level I had in Vigo, helping the team and enjoying myself. There’s always hope [for Russia]. It’s difficult but there are seven to go; Euro 2016 was difficult too and look. I’ll keep going, like a steam hammer. I feel like a kid again. I want to enjoy this for as long as I can, then retire happy.
“I won’t go on forever. And when I’m finished,” he says, dusting off his hands, “let the young ones come and play instead. I’ll go back to my village, go fishing with my brother, maybe train the kids, play for the veterans, a bit tubby.”
Just not yet. “Life goes on: the sun comes out every day,” he says, grinning as he gets up to leave Sevilla’s training ground. “At least in Spain it does.”


Donald Trump has resumed his attack on the NFL protest movement, saying the Oakland Raiders running back Marshawn Lynch should be suspended after he sat for the national anthem.
The Raiders played the New England Patriots in Mexico City on Sunday and stood for the Mexican national anthem. He remained standing for the opening of the Star-Spangled Banner before sitting down.
“Marshawn Lynch of the NFL’s Oakland Raiders stands for the Mexican Anthem and sits down to boos for our National Anthem,” tweeted Trump on Monday morning. “Great disrespect! Next time NFL should suspend him for remainder of season. Attendance and ratings way down.”
Marshawn Lynch of the NFL’s Oakland Raiders stands for the Mexican Anthem and sits down to boos for our National Anthem. Great disrespect! Next time NFL should suspend him for remainder of season. Attendance and ratings way down.
The anthem protest movement was started last season by Colin Kaepernick to highlight racial injustice in the United States. Lynch came out of retirement this season and is yet to stand for the anthem, although he has not said why. However, last month he wore an t-shirt that read “Everybody vs Trump”. Trump prompted large numbers of players to protest earlier this season after saying any player who kneels for the anthem should be fired. Only a small number of players are still kneeling during the anthem – apart from Lynch four other players knelt during the Star-Spangled Banner on Sunday. There are 32 teams in the NFL, and 46 players on each roster are eligible to l
It is highly unlikely that the NFL would – or even could – suspend Lynch as there is no rule forcing players to stand for the anthem. TV ratings are, however, down this season although the same is true for sports across America including Nascar. Stadium attendances have held steady although the NFL takes into account season tickets in attendance figures, even if fans do not show up.
Trump’s tweet is likely to play well with his base - an ESPN survey showed the majority of white Americans oppose the protests. The same survey showed most African Americans approve.
The president was involved in another sports story on Sunday. After intervening to secure the release of three UCLA basketball players held for shoplifting in China, Trump said he wished he had left them in jail. He was apparently incensed after one of the player’s fathers questioned how big a part Trump had played in their release. All three players had thanked Trump for his help.


An hour after the match, Eddie Jones snapped. Four questions into his press conference, Jones was asked how he felt about the marginal calls made by the referee, Ben O’Keeffe, and whether he felt England had been lucky to get the better of them. It was a fair question, but it set off Jones’s hair-trigger temper. “Why do we have a referee? Why do we have TMOs? I don’t understand the question,” Jones said. “How were we lucky? Ten replays of the video and they make a decision. This is the best referee in the world for today, they have the best guys doing the TMO, and you’re saying we’re lucky because the decisions went our way. Sorry, sorry, sorry. I’m sorry we’re lucky.”
Jones’s acidic answer curdled the mood of the room. He is, they say, a hard man to work with, as prickly as a cactus, and he has a habit of picking on journalists in public. Since England are winning, he could rightly argue that it doesn’t matter a damn, and so long as they carry on that way it won’t cost him anything but amity. If he ever finds himself in need of a little goodwill, however, he may regret the way he is squandering some of it now. As the saying goes, you catch more flies with honey than vinegar. Which Jones knows – just look at the way he buttered up O’Keeffe before and after Saturday’s match.
On Friday, Jones had described O’Keeffe as “an intelligent guy”, “very competent, accurate and fit”. This after Michael Cheika made a point of talking about England’s habit of making late hits on his half-backs. Jones must have known that Cheika has a history with O’Keeffe, who refereed Australia’s 27-27 draw with South Africa last September. After that match, Cheika called O’Keeffe “a good young referee” but then ran through a list of all the mistakes O’Keeffe had made. “There were some forward passes, knock-ons and I suppose most disappointing for us, the goal that equalised the game, there’s no doubt that [Pieter-Steph] du Toit is offside into that ruck.”
With all that in the background, Jones could not help but stir it up on Friday, when he spoke so pointedly about how much “respect” he had for O’Keeffe, whereas “obviously Cheika feels the referees haven’t done a good job”. And a day later, after a game in which so many big decisions seemed to go England’s way, he was quick to talk up O’Keeffe all over again when that question about England’s luck came up. Australia had two men sent to the sin-bin and two tries disallowed, while England were awarded one when the ball had seemed so very close to being in touch.
None of those five calls were so very wrong as one might think from reading David Campese’s Twitter feed (“a disgrace”, “don’t know why I love this game”, “ref has no idea”), but they were all close enough to be contentious. O’Keeffe certainly would not have been consciously swayed by anything Jones and Cheika said. But on a subconscious level, as he stood in the middle of that downpour at Twickenham, 80,000 English fans singing and shouting around him, all Jones’s sweet-talk certainly could not hurt England’s chances of edging these enormously difficult, incredibly fine decisions.
O’Keeffe was not the only ref who had a rough weekend. Mathieu Raynal was outmanoeuvred by Warren Gatland during Wales’s victory against Georgia. When Tomas Francis was sent to the sin-bin, Leon Brown, who had already been substituted, apparently came down with cramp. So Wales did not have a tighthead prop to send on, and Raynal had to switch to uncontested scrums, which negated one of Georgia’s great strengths. “Fastest one ever,” Adam Jones, who knows more than most about Gatland’s tactics and front row play, wrote on Twitter after the match. “This ref and TMO should be sacked.”
Rugby union has always been a hard game to referee. The very first international match, between England and Scotland, was won by a try from a scrum that, the English insisted, should have been disallowed because the ball had not been fairly grounded. But the job has become so difficult that it is a wonder anyone takes it up at all.
Fewer are. New Zealand Rugby reports that the number of referees there has dropped by 9% in the past four years. Which is one reason why it is keen to promote younger refs, such as O’Keeffe. He is 28, and has only been officiating at top-tier matches for 12 months. He is, and you could not make this up, a practising ophthalmologist.
The referee back in that first international match, Hely Hutchinson Almond, explained later that he was not sure whether Scotland’s try should have stood but that the English had complained so much about it and “when an umpire is in doubt I think he is justified in deciding against the side which makes most noise”. Years later, many of the rules of the game have changed, but one that still stands is that it pays to keep the referee sweet.


As England’s plane touched down in Brisbane on Sunday the Australia coach, Darren Lehmann, said: “We love playing here.” It is easy to see why, because Australians love winning and at the Gabba they almost always win. England last left victorious in 1986, and Australia lost against West Indies in 1988 but have not been defeated at the Gabba since. Just seven of those 29 Tests have been drawn, two of them by England.
The “Gabbattoir” is a fortress and England’s recent visits – with the exception, like almost everything regarding away Ashes series this century, of 2010-11 – hold horrific memories, from Nasser Hussain’s call to Simon Jones’s injury, to Mitchell Johnson’s resurgence and Steve Harmison’s wide. The sense is that if England can fly to Adelaide level-pegging then they have a chance this series. Get blown away – as Mitchell Starc and Pat Cummins could do, and Johnson did – and the road back is long, hot and utterly inhospitable.
England’s arrival this time did not run quite as expected. It was drizzling, and cold. England emerged from an arrivals gate 100 yards from the one by which the throng – perhaps an overstatement – of fans and media were assembled. Jonny Bairstow, put up to answer questions, expressed a touch of surprise at how few press were stood before him. Nothing about it was desperately theatrical or, indeed, imposing. That will change come Thursday, and so will Bairstow’s description of the mood in the touring camp: “Content. Relaxed. Excited.”
The myriad backroom staff truly are miracle workers if England remain “relaxed” on the morning of the game. Only a quarter of the 16 tourists – the captain and the three wise old dukes – have played a Test at the Gabba, and just two more – Bairstow and Gary Ballance – have been in the squad for a match there. It was fine thinking from the management to grant England Lions, who are in town (and have been rejoined by George Garton), a day off on Thursday, so they can experience the feel of the fixture. Next time, boys. The atmosphere four years ago, Bairstow recalls, was “unforgettable”.
Jason Gillespie spins a good yarn about his contrasting experiences of the Gabba’s atmosphere. In March 1995, a month shy of his 20th birthday, he played for South Australia in the Sheffield Shield final against Queensland. The home side won their first Shield title (sparking a run of seven in 17 years), and South Australia were barracked off the pitch. “It was quite an eye-opener for a young bloke,” Gillespie recalls. “There was a big crowd for a Shield game and we were called everything under the sun. It was the worst stuff you could imagine – derogatory, abusive, and pretty aggressive.”
It was November 2001 before Gillespie played the first of his four Tests at the ground, against New Zealand. “I couldn’t have been made to feel more welcome,” he said. “They loved us, and it was totally the opposite of what I’d known before. There seemed to be no recollection of the things that had been said. You’d certainly rather be on their side. The support was amazing and they have a great sense of humour.”
Jonathan Trott might disagree. He had greater worries in 2013, but memorably recalls the chant “Trott, Trott, Trott, your mum’s got vaginal rot” ringing out. The Gabba is a big bowl, another homogenous stadium, now (that certainly was not always the case; once there was a hill and a track for racing dogs), and the sound hangs in the air like few other places. The sound is usually the best part of 42,000 Queenslanders (the first three days are sold out) not just saying, but screaming, what they are thinking.
The Queensland crowd – Australia’s most parochial, possessing a fierce sense of rough-and-ready regional identity – is just one reason Gillespie reckons Australia are so successful there. Normally, it is stinking hot (although this week threatens to be damp). So often it comes first in the summer’s calendar (this is the ninth successive Ashes series in Australia the ground has opened), meaning touring sides can be caught cold, or flustered by the bluster and the hype. The dressing rooms are underground, with a viewing area for the players to watch the game meaning that, simultaneously, fans can watch them. There’s no hiding.
Brisbane’s Courier-Mail – whose tricks on this trip, having lost a couple of their notable attack dogs, will be interesting – are as into it as the crowd. And the pitch, considered by many the best wicket in the world, is distinct, and suits Australians perfectly. It is quick, bouncy, true and, importantly, is a permanent fixture. So many other Australian grounds have had their identities eroded by samey drop-ins.
This week’s is of interest because it is the last prepared by the curator Kevin Mitchell Jr after 27 years in the job (before that he did six years as assistant curator, working under his father, another Kevin). Groundsmen are a serious business in Australia, which is why they have a highfalutin name like “curator”. They sometimes give press conferences, and their work is respected and reported closely. Mitchell will want to leave the family business with a bang. He will also want to keep up his remarkable unbeaten record, and make it three decades of Australian dominance.
Here, then, we see England entering the most hostile of cricket grounds. Even one of the ends, Vulture Street, has a name that hints at a painful death. England arrive chipper, cheerful and champing at the bit but having met nothing on tour that even remotely resembles what lies in wait. Their optimism and unity is encouraging, but it is about to undergo a very serious test.


FC Barcelona pulled out of Butarque on an angular blue and orange bus that looked like it had been borrowed from a school trip in the 90s a bit before seven on Saturday evening and headed 30 kilometres north up the M40 to the airport at Barajas, their work done. Half of it, anyway. Nearby, just about visible from the terminal, stood the Wanda Metropolitano, where the rest of it was done for them. Not long after Barça had set off, and a couple of hours after Alavés had passed on their way north back up the A1 to Euskadi, Real Madrid embarked upon the shortest journey they’ve undertaken in La Liga, making the 10-minute trip from their HQ at Valdebebas to Atlético’s new home. It was a short trip, but when they returned a little before midnight, broken and bloodied, it felt like a long way back. For Barcelona, it had been a grand day out.
From the Coliseum across to Eleven Lions Avenue – yes, really – and up to Avenida Arcentales, there were three games in Madrid on Saturday and the third of them was the game: Getafe-Alavés at 1pm, Leganés-Barcelona at 4.15pm and then Atlético-Real at 8.45pm. As flight AEA938 climbed into the sky, the first Madrid derby at the Wanda hadn’t yet started and when it landed, just after nine, it hadn’t yet finished. There hadn’t been a goal yet, either – Ángel Correa had missed the game’s best chance after three minutes, Diego Simeone looking like he was fighting back tears on the touchline, and Toni Kroos nudged one wide at the other end, but that was about it – and Barcelona’s players just about had time to get home for the second half. Those that wanted to, that is – and you might be surprised how few footballers bother.
They didn’t see much football. As the game entered the final few minutes, tension rising in the Wanda, that inevitable, familiar feeling of doom starting to take hold, atléticos fearing that the first derby here was going to end in the most atlético way imaginable, they did see the ball fall to Cristiano Ronaldo with a little over a minute to go. They saw the goal open up before him and they saw him control it, run at it, and hit it hard; they also saw Lucas Hernández come flying across and block it. There was a roar and Atlético’s players came to congratulate Lucas while on the bench – the Real Madrid bench – his brother Theo held his head in his hands. Then, with the score still 0-0, they saw the referee bring the derby to an end. And, some said, the title too.
By Sunday morning, all the papers ran with the same message on the front. They all ran with the exact same cover in fact – a full wraparound advert for the league’s official television set, on which watching at home is apparently “just like being in the stadium”. Which isn’t true: there are no endless replays eating up the actual action, rubbish camera angles offering nothing or pointless sodding graphics offering even less when you’re in the stadium; there isn’t a commentator constantly telling you what minute we’re in when there’s a clock in the corner of the screen, either. And there is a lot of noise, plenty of bouncing about, some singing, and an atmosphere too – although in truth perhaps a little less than you might have expected. But, that was the message on the front of Marca, AS, Mundo Deportivo and Sport, anyway.
Behind the ad, they were saying much the same thing too, if not always in the same words. And, this time, how could they not? “The derby was won by … Barça,” ran the cover of Marca, speaking for all of them. This time, the capital had been good to them.
A few days before, Marca had called the first meeting at the Wanda the “desperation derby” and on the morning of the match they called it “a final, in week 12.” AS warned there was “no margin for error”. Sport had called it: “A Saturday that could decide half the league title” and El Mundo Deportivo drew up a map of the capital and led on “the league in 20km”. They’d been burnt enough before, which might explain why they were a little less presumptuous than previously, and if they tempted fate a little, at least fate didn’t make a charge at them this time. For once, they were right.
For much of the match, Leganés were the better side at Butarque – by the end, they had fired off 18 shots to Barcelona’s 11 and Marc-André ter Stegen took his season stats to 39 shots on target faced, 34 shots on target saved – but Luis Suárez scored for the first time in 533 minutes, then scored again, and in the last minute Paulinho made it 3-0. “It is true: there were moments when we weren’t especially good,” Ernesto Valverde admitted. “Maybe three is a bit excessive.” Maybe, but as they took off for home, they were 11 points clear. It is early still but even a draw in the derby was not much use; Madrid and Atlético had to win. Only Barcelona did.
At the end of week 12, Barcelona stood 10 points clear of Atlético and Madrid. By Monday morning, Marca were placing their hopes elsewhere – “Valencia keep up the pace”, their headline ran – and on Sunday there was a sense of the title slipping away. “It’s not over,” Zinedine Zidane insisted. “But 10 points is a lot,” he admitted. “+10,” shouted the cover of sport. “10 away,” said El Mundo Deportivo. The derby had done it. “Atlético and Madrid give life to Barcelona,” said El País. “It was a war and Barça won it,” ran the cover of AS. “It was a Vietnamese derby,” its match report ran, “and Barcelona ended up winning this war without firing a shot.”
Not least because Karim Benzema and Antoine Griezmann didn’t fire a shot either. Not one. This was the game that helped explain why Madrid and Atlético are 10 points behind. Flat, lacking imagination, few chances, more fouls than football. Before the game, Lucas and Theo Hernández’s mum asked her sons not to kick each other. In the end, Theo didn’t play, but they probably wouldn’t have listened anyway, and nor would anyone else. Lucas kicked Sergio Ramos in the face, breaking his nose. That was accidental; other challenges weren’t, although it wasn’t as dirty as some made out. Stefan Savic on Kroos was particularly bad, while Correa booted the ball straight at Benzema. He was more accurate with that than he had been when a series of deflections and mistakes ended with Raphaël Varane’s “assist” leaving him one on one.
For Atlético, this was a 12th game unbeaten, but it was also a sixth draw. It wasn’t one that brought great joy either, even if they did avoid defeat by Madrid, damaging their title chances; at the end, the feeling was a little flat. Something certainly isn’t right. One of the clearest conclusions was that Atlético don’t have a No9 and maybe even that Madrid don’t either – not just in the sense of a player that finishes chances, but a player that seeks them, that makes the runs that helps to create them, whose sights are set on goal.
On Saturday they had two on the bench – and if they’re not necessarily at the level Atlético demand, when Fernando Torres and Kevin Gameiro came on they created Atlético’s best chance, Varane heading off the line. They also have one waiting, of course, Diego Costa unable to play until January. That is never ideal and Simeone admitted it is not easy to manage a situation in which you have a player who is there but not really there, that it is difficult for other strikers who know one of them will have to leave, that in all probability opportunities are temporary at best.
For most of the game, the ‘striker’ was Griezmann – and that’s not really his natural role. He doesn’t want to be there; some suspect he doesn’t want to be around at all, and all the ambiguity and repeated hints about a departure are taking their toll. When he was taken off, Griezmann was whistled by fans. Simeone made a point of applauding him and in the press conference afterwards shouted – really, really shouted – that he had learnt you support “your family to the death”. But while that was reported as a determined defence, one standout line, offered twice, appeared a clearer message: “For as long as he is part of the family,” sounded very much like he soon won’t be and revealed that all was not well. So too did Simeone shouting – again, really, really shouting – a mantra: “Work! Work! Work! Then talent. But first, work!” Trouble is, perspiration is one thing; inspiration quite another.
If Atlético struggling to score is not entirely unexpected, Madrid struggling to is. “Sometimes the ball doesn’t want to go in,” Zidane said, but that message doesn’t convince, even if he has a point. Sure, a little more luck and things might look a lot different. Against Levante, Valencia and Betis they probably should have won. Here, there was a big appeal for a penalty for handball from Diego Godín and Kroos might have scored. Afterwards Zidane insisted he was pleased with the way his team had played, calling it a “great performance” and insisting “all that was missing was the goal”. He said: “Maybe against Tottenham or Girona we didn’t play well but today we did.” And yet the day they were defeated in Girona he had claimed “in terms of effort, running, play, we were good”. They weren’t.
Public and private messages are not the same thing of course. But even if it was true that Madrid had played well, even though it is true that fortune plays a part and simple explanations don’t always exist, even though there are injuries, his team look sluggish, they lack creativity and a discernible pattern, Isco forced ever deeper to try to get them going, and there’s a vulnerability about them. On Saturday, Casemiro broke everything up, but when it came to making something happen, it was Marcelo or Isco or pretty much nothing. Zidane admitted to some “anxiety” in front of goal, but not to the failings elsewhere.
And the statistics are becoming overwhelming. AS called Benzema “the inexistent No9”. He has just one league goal. Ronaldo has just one league goal, from 55 shots. Gareth Bale has two. Paulinho has more goals than the BBC put together. Álvaro Morata has twice as many. They are scoring an average of a goal less a game than last season.
Then there’s the biggest stat of all, splashed across the front of all the papers : those 10 points. The league may not be over as many said, it may not be “IMPOSSIBLE”, as per Sport’s gloating cover: Barcelona don’t entirely convince, even their own Twitter feed posting a picture of Messi and Ter Stegen, calling them the main reason they’re top, and the last time they started like this, under Tata Martino, they didn’t win the title; there are still 78 points in play; there are two clásicos to come; and there’s Valencia too; but the gap is huge. No one has ever won the title from so far behind. That was already the case before Barcelona reached Madrid and as they boarded the place to go back again; by the time they landed, things looked even better.
It was late and Barcelona’s players had arrived home safely, when Zidane appeared under the stand at the Wanda, the bus waiting outside, his beaten players on board, his captain’s head spinning, nose packed with gauze. “That’s football,” he said. “It changes quickly and we’ll be there to the end.”
• Six teams played in Madrid on Saturday, and here’s the thing: Getafe and Leganés were probably best of them. Getafe were so good that some are even talking about them doing something more than surviving. “Talking about Europe gives me vertigo,” said coach José Bordalás. As for Alavés’s manager, he was suffering a very different sensation. “I feel ashamed,” Gianni De Biasi said.
• “We’re still not candidates yet,” Valencia’s assistant manager Rubén Uría insisted after a wonderful goal from Geoffrey Kondogbia helped his side beat Espanyol 2-0 in an enjoyable game the home team might well have won, leaving Quique Sánchez Flores lamenting that “sometimes it’s hard to explain”. Not yet? Maybe, but win next week and they certainly will be: it’s Valencia v Barcelona.
• “The truth is, it’s been hard,” Borja Bastón said and he can say that again. He got his reward at last as Málaga got a massive, massive win, coming from 2-1 down to beat Deportivo 3-2 at the Rosaleda.
• Pako Ayesteran’s 100% record continues: every La Liga game he has managed has ended in defeat. This time, 2-0 at home to Levante. At the end, he shook his Las Palmas players’ hands, a lost look on their faces and a sacking probably isn’t far off . “I would have to be dead to surrender,” he insisted.
• That’s six unbeaten for Javi Calleja since taking over at Villarreal, although his side were close as Athletic came forward in the last 20 minutes of an enjoyable game at San Mamés, noise rolling round. Athletic got the equaliser after Manu Trigueros had bent in a lovely first, Aritz Aduriz heading home, but they couldn’t quite get a winner – and they almost got caught on the break.
Results: Girona 1–1 Rea Sociedad, Getafe 4–1 Alavés, Leganés 0–3 Barcelona, Sevilla 2–1 Celta, Atlético 0–0 Madrid, Málaga 3–2 Deportivo, Espanyol 0–2 Valencia, Las Palmas 0–2 Levante, Athletic 1 – 1 Villarreal.


Somebody, somewhere tried to make a few quid. This is the upsetting detail at the core of Altiorgate, which was still the cause of anxious discussion at Cheltenham on Sunday, as racing and betting professionals tried to divine the lessons to be learned.
There is room for debate about when is the right moment to inform the general public about an injury to a horse. My impression is that the news about Altior could have been got out earlier but the delay was not egregious. There have been longer delays in other cases that caused less controversy.
What gets everyone’s backs up is the impression that, in the middle of Wednesday afternoon, somebody who appears to have learned Altior would miss the Tingle Creek stuck a few bets on the other horses and/or laid him on Betfair. That sudden activity caused a couple of firms to change their odds and, in at least once instance, to suspend betting.
I imagine we’ll never know who was responsible for these bets. Neither the British Horseracing Authority nor the Gambling Commission will say if they’re investigating a particular subject but there have been similar cases in the past which never led to disciplinary action. The bookmakers will know who placed the bets but if they choose not to complain about those bets, their clients will remain anonymous.
The damage done here has been limited. I was pleased to learn from Unibet that they have refunded all bets on Altior in the Tingle Creek market, even to people who backed him weeks ago, before his breathing problem became apparent. That’s a refund of something like two-thirds of the bets they’d taken on this market, they say. It’s more than most folk would expect them to do in the circumstances.
The damage that concerns me is to racing’s image. Once again, it looks like a sport that allows those in the know to make a canny profit while the rest of us are left in the dark until that profit has been secured, possibly at our expense.
The BHA says it is “embarking on a significant programme of integrity education”, for the benefit of racing’s participants. I hope that as part of that, they stress to trainers the importance of getting information out to the public before the betting market starts to move.
This, to me, is the key target. You can get away with a short delay if the betting market doesn’t move. But even a short delay is too long if the price starts to drift.
On Friday, Henderson said that he had moved as quickly as he could. “We couldn’t have done this any better, any quicker, any more professionally,” he told ITV Racing at Cheltenham.
There are different ways for trainers to deal with this burden and we don’t know how Henderson handled it. They can rush to inform the public if they have a setback to a fancied horse in a major race. They can restrict news of that setback to a small handful of trusted people until the time comes to break the news to everyone else.
What we really need is for all trainers to accept responsibility for getting the news out before the market breaks the news for them. It is not an easy thing to do and sometimes you’ll fail through no fault of your own. I accept that it’s an additional pain for people whose work is already challenging and complex. But, for the sake of racing’s image, the sport needs trainers to concede that this is now part of their job.
I’m afraid it’s clear from his pronouncements over the past week, and on previous occasions, that Nicky Henderson, in my opinion, does not see this as being part of his job and I’m sure there are many other trainers who share his feelings on the subject. For the sake of racing’s appeal to new generations of punters, that attitude needs to change. If people feel that racing is too dangerous an environment for them to approach, they will go elsewhere.
I was gnashing my teeth a bit when Sauchiehall Street (1.30) got beat at Kempton a fortnight ago, when he got going a bit too late and ran on to be fourth. He was trying to repeat a course and distance success from a fortnight earlier, from a 7lb higher mark.
He’s gone up another 1lb today but gets an extra 300 yards at Wolverhampton, which gives me encouragement that he’ll get to the front in time. He really needs to because odds of 2-1 don’t exactly count as charity.
An hour later, Exchequer (2.30) is an interesting addition to David O’Meara’s yard and I’m encouraged to see that early interest has taken his odds to 5-1 from the original 7s. He was a first-time-out winner for David Brown last year and is now 5lb below the mark he had that day. His all-weather strike-rate is three wins from eight starts.
Pick of Leicester’s card may be High Expectations (1.50) from Gordon Elliott’s yard. He was looking dangerous when unseating three-out at Cheltenham last month and gets to run from the same mark. Richard Johnson takes the ride this time and 5-2 is fair.

If the evidence presented in the opening week of the US Justice Department’s Fifa corruption trial was not grim enough, the recent sight of a footballer named Mambo not wearing No5 provided further evidence that the game is to all intents and purposes “gone”. During a televised National League match between his side and Leyton Orient, the Ebbsfleet United central defender Yado Mambo became an unlikely social media talking point when viewers noticed the 26-year-old’s club had missed a trick by failing to allocate him the obvious digit as an homage to that 1999 Lou Bega smash‑hit dancefloor filler. “Imagine signing a player called Mambo and not giving him the No5 shirt,” mused one Twitter user under a screengrab of Mambo wearing No18. “Poor form from Ebbsfleet United.”
Speaking to Radio Kent at the height of his Warholian 15 minutes, Mambo revealed that he had in fact requested the shirt number in question before the season started, but had been turned down by spoilsport Ebbsfleet manager, Daryl McMahon. “I told my gaffer the same thing, but I don’t think he believed me until over this weekend, when it has just blown up all over social media,” he said. “Maybe now he’ll take it a bit more seriously and change the numbers next season. [Mambo No5] was one of my favourite songs at that age. At school a lot of kids used to sing it to me.”
Ebbsfleet have at least moved to address this appalling oversight by having a one-off Mambo No5 shirt put up for auction on eBay, where it looks set to raise a sizeable sum for Prostate Cancer UK. We can only hope Tottenham Hotspur’s No40, Luke Amos, and his team-mate Harry Winks have since opened negotiations.
On the face of it, shirt numbers are no more than a means of identification but they are so much more than that. Some are iconic: traditionally associated with creative genius – not just any old clogger gets to wear No10. Word from the Emirates Stadium suggests prising that particular Arsenal shirt from the shoulders of Jack Wilshere is believed to be a strict condition of any new deal Mesut Özil may or may not sign with the club after his splendid performance against Tottenham on Saturday. The often-maligned midfielder already wears the No10 shirt for Germany and a cursory perusal of his Twitter feed suggests he is more than a little obsessed with occupying that particular number than any number of wannabe prime ministers.
In his autobiography, Harry Redknapp revealed that in 1996 the new West Ham signing Paulo Futre stormed out of Highbury on the opening day of the season upon being handed the No16 shirt by West Ham’s kitman. “Futre No10, not No16,” he hissed at his bemused manager. “Eusebio No10, Maradona No10, Pelé No10; Futre No10, not fucking No16.” With the help of his lawyers and a promise the shirt’s then incumbent John Moncur could use his Algarve holiday villa and its adjacent golf course whenever he liked, Futre eventually got his wish.

Not as cringeworthy as it seems. Former France full-back was born in 1969, is 169cm tall and weighs 69 kg
After taking over as player manager at Barnet, the former Holland midfielder took the traditional goalkeeping number: "I am going to start this trend"
The No10 shirt at Milan was occupied by Clarence Seedorf, so the Brazilian opted to have the year of his birth on his back. Mathieu Flamini (84) and Andriy Shevchenko (76) copied him.
The Italian goalkeeper wanted 00, then 01 (a Duke's of Hazzard reference) but plumped for 88 "because it reminds me of four balls and in Italy we all know what it means to have balls: strength and determination." He faced criticism from the Jewish community who said the number had Nazi connotations, charges he denied.
Other players have not been so petulant, choosing instead to simply accept their place in the pecking order. When Roberto Baggio signed for Inter in 1998 and insisted on taking Ronaldo’s No10 shirt, the Brazilian striker was duly handed the No9 worn by Iván Zamorano. Demonstrating heart‑warming diplomacy, the Chilean striker and club legend they called “Bam Bam” chose not to demur and instead harked back to his former status by wearing 1+8 on his back. Which is kind of No9.
While few could accuse the Brazilian Ronaldo’s preening, narcissistic modern-day Portuguese namesake Cristiano of narcissism, the four-times Fifa Ballon d’Or winner has incorporated the iconic digit he wears into his personal brand and it would take a foolhardy team-mate to try to relieve CR7 of his number. For many people of a certain age, No7 will forever be the name of the mule belonging to Mad Jack the eccentric prospector on The Life And Times of Grizzly Adams, but in a football context it calls to mind iconic greats from the pantheon: Garrincha, Luis Figo, Eric Cantona, David Beckham, George Best and Kenny Dalglish.
Even in baseball it resonates: one episode of Seinfeld centred on George Costanza’s plan to name his first born Seven, after the New York Yankees legend Mickey Mantle. Along with his fiancee Billi Mucklow, Andy Carroll recently followed suit by naming his second son Wolf Nine, presumably after a certain hirsute West Ham striker.
Gianluigi Buffon’s decision to wear No88 at Parma famously upset Italy’s Jewish population, who saw it as neo-Nazi symbolism (H is the eighth letter of the alphabet, so 88 equates to HH, or Heil Hitler). The goalkeeper, who had just lost his place in the Italian national team to Francesco Toldo, pleaded ignorance of this hidden meaning and insisted his choice of bingo’s two fat ladies was a motivational tool. “I have chosen 88 because it reminds me of four balls and in Italy we all know what it means to have balls: strength and determination,” he said. “And this season I will have to have balls to get back my place in the Italy team.” Whatever his logic, it had the desired effect.
Closer to home, it was widely reported that, as an Arsenal player, Nicklas Bendtner requested and wore the No52 shirt in tribute to the £52,000 weekly salary he received upon signing for the club. Only a cynic would suggest it is a measure of how far both this squandered talent’s stock and income have since fallen, that at his current club Rosenborg the Dane currently lines up wearing No9.

West Ham United fans have been warned to stop calling 999 to complain about their team. The side suffered a 2-0 defeat at Watford on Sunday in David Moyes’s first match in charge, with goals from Will Hughes and Richarlison settling the match at Vicarage Road.
It seems some supporters have been taking their grievances too far though, with the Essex Police Force Control Room urging them to stop using the emergency number.
A tweet from the @EPControlRoom account read: “Ringing 999 because @WestHamUtd have lost again and you aren’t sure what to do is not acceptable! It is a complete waste of our time. #999foremergenciesonly.”
Sections of the visiting support chanted “sack the board” during the match as the team remained 18th in the Premier League table.

West Ham host Leicester in their first home match since Moyes’s appointment on Friday. The manager appealed for unity among the supporters after watching his new team lose, a result which leaves them marooned in the relegation zone. Hughes’s opening goal in the 11th minute was greeted with a chorus of “sack the board”.
“We need a united club,” said Moyes. “I know that’s hard if you have grievances but I said to the players at the end that it’s hard to play when the crowd’s like that. The small things can make a big difference but I can understand their frustration because we didn’t play well enough. We need to find a way to make sure we get the club together.”
Meanwhile, captain Mark Noble has urged West Ham’s unhappy supporters to get behind their struggling team.
“It’s a very difficult situation for us,” he said. “The fans show their emotions, and rightly so because they’re not happy and they pay a lot of money to come and watch us.
“I know it’s hard, I know they’re frustrated, and we are too because we know we’re better than what we’re showing, but I urge them to stick by us and hopefully the good times will come back.
“As much as we’re not performing on the pitch at the minute, we need them to stick by us.”


With seven seconds on the clock Andy Carroll rose to challenge Marvin Zeegelaar for a high ball and left the Watford debutant on the floor, his nose bleeding. It had not taken long for the forward to make an impression on his opponents.
In the starting lineup for the first time in six weeks, handed a new chance by a new manager, there could be no better time for Carroll to prove his worth. Perhaps with this performance he could make himself the toast of his team, acclaimed by his new coach. As it happened at half-time David Moyes sought him out for a chat, but instead of receiving a congratulatory handshake he was told that having fully considered the game and all its complexities his manager had decided that he only had another 10 minutes. By then he had been booked for tripping Richarlison – whose dramatic reaction hardly helped the situation – and had left a foot unnaturally high after falling over Christian Kabasele. “Half-time was a decision because I wasn’t sure if he was going to get himself sent off,” said Moyes. “I told him I wouldn’t take him off but I’d only give him 10 or 15 minutes of the second half.”
In the end he got 20 and when the board went up to beckon him to the bench the away fans started to sing. “You’re not fit to wear the shirt,” they chorused, the striker clearly the target of a chant that could reasonably have had a wider focus. After West Ham’s demoralising 4-1 defeat to Liverpool before the international break Carroll said that supporters “really should be staying until the end” because “you never know what’s going to happen”.
They stayed to the end this time, even though it was becoming pretty clear what was going to happen: largely to maximise their opportunity to rain abuse down on the striker. “I was surprised. I didn’t know there was anything before,” said Moyes of the bad feeling between player and fans. “I felt from the off every time Andy Carroll goes for a challenge now the opposition crowd make it really difficult and affect the referee.” It is a complaint that – unlike Carroll’s swinging arm – loses a little impact when the challenge’s subject still has blood-soaked pads stuffed up his nostrils when the final whistle is blown.
Carroll was not the supporters’ only target. The away fans made very clear their hatred for the co-owners, David Gold and David Sullivan, who had “destroyed our club”. Moyes made clear after the game his disappointment in his players, but also his bewilderment at a level of fury pouring down from the away end that was clearly beyond his most pessimistic expectations. “Look, I don’t know the history and the reasons for it, I’m only just here,” he said. “I thought they were supportive of me and I’m thankful for that. Those supporters know much better than I do the history.”
Moyes had reorganised the team, bringing in Carroll, Pablo Zabaleta and Marko Arnautovic and fielding a back four. But though they had the game’s finest chances this was a chronically disjointed performance, with Carroll far from the only player to disappoint. In the first few minutes of the second half they twice had possession and twice – Pedro Obiang and Aaron Cresswell the culprits – gently passed the ball off the pitch for no obvious reason, a period that summed up their afternoon. Not everybody disappointed, with Manuel Lanzini surely above reproach, but there were few bright spots. “There’s some players with big reputations who disappointed me a little bit,” said Moyes. “They need to show me: if that’s your reputation, show me why you’ve got it.”
His opposite number was busy showing why he has a reputation that has brought Everton to his door bearing a desperate demeanour and an outsize chequebook. Forced to produce a strategy that would make light of the absence of André Carrillo, fit only for a place on the bench because of Peru’s World Cup play-off with New Zealand in the early hours of Thursday morning, he gave Will Hughes, making his first home start, licence to float around the right flank. He was rewarded with an excellent performance, the player’s intelligence of movement, technical expertise and manipulation of angles transforming a potential weakness into an area of particular strength. Meanwhile Watford’s one known weakness, their defending from corners, was never examined by limp opponents who only won one of them.
The home fans hoisted a flag bearing a picture of their owner, Gino Pozzo, before the game kicked off and begged their manager to stay as it concluded, terrified of the kind of changes that West Ham supporters have recently seen their club subjected to.


As football soundbites go, the summer declaration by the Middlesbrough owner, Steve Gibson, that his club would “smash the league” in their attempts to return to the Premier League this season is slowly but surely looking like one of the more misguided utterances.
It certainly threatens to become a millstone around the neck of his manager, Garry Monk, whose return to Leeds United – the club he left in controversial circumstances to work for Gibson following Middlesbrough’s relegation last season – ended in a defeat that ended his team’s recent mini-revival.
That three-game winning run had lifted Boro back into the fringes of the early-season chase for automatic promotion, following an October which had ended with Monk’s team in the wrong half of the table.
The £40m-plus invested by Gibson last summer now looks as questionable as his predictions, with Middlesbrough 12 points behind the leader, Wolverhampton Wanderers ... and 13 ahead of the relegation places.
“There’s a lot of football to be played,” Monk said. “Week in, week out, you see changes, fluctuations in places, how the table can change within one, two or three games. It changes all the time.
“We stay focused, try to do our best and pick up results along the way. We’re off the back of a good run ourselves, three wins in a row, and deserved to pick up at least a point today. We’ll show a good response in the next game, I’m sure.”
Monk’s decision to swap Leeds for Teesside was widely understood and appreciated within football given the unorthodox leadership techniques of the club’s former owner Massimo Cellino. Ever the diplomat, Monk would only go as far as to describe the former Leeds owner’s management style as “different” in the build-up to his return.
But if there is a wider understanding why the former Swansea manager would have sought alternative employment, it went unappreciated by his old supporters at Elland Road, despite Monk leading them to a respectable seventh‑place finish last term.
All season long, Leeds matches have been punctuated by chants hurling expletives in Monk’s direction and on Sunday they extended to obscenities.
“Look, it’s not about me,” Monk said after the defeat. “What happened happened. I have said my side, the club has said their side, it’s done and dusted. I’ve got great memories of this club here. I enjoyed last season but now I’m at Middlesbrough my only focus is on Middlesbrough.”
If the attention unduly troubled Monk, he did not let it show although the way Middlesbrough were swept aside by a Leeds side who had lost seven of their previous eight league and cup games will have been of greater concern.
Of the £40m invested in new talent pre-season, three-quarters was invested in forward players although the notion that they are still not gelling in perfect harmony seemed to be borne out at Elland Road.
It required an outrageously bad penalty decision – awarded against Leeds’ Luke Ayling, who had clearly been fouled by Boro’s Daniel Ayala before returning the compliment – to allow the visitors a second-half foothold in the game as Britt Assombalonga’s spot-kick made it 2-1.
Marcus Tavernier, a promising 18-year-old academy graduate who scored the recent winning goal against Sunderland, showed a lack of composure and poor control when he wasted a chance to draw Boro level after an opening Leeds goal from Pablo Hernández. Within moments, Ezgjan Alioski had doubled the home team’s lead and Monk’s recent revival was coming to an end.
The manner of the two Leeds goals also highlighted the work that still needs to be done in defence for Middlesbrough to launch a concerted promotion bid in the second half of the season.
George Friend and Ayala, two players presumably shellshocked after their exposure to the harsh realities of the Premier League last season, might have expected to be phased out this season. Instead, they find themselves rotated back into Monk’s back four although the manager does, at least, appear to have done away with his tendency over the opening weeks to chop and change his team, often without apparent reason.
Still, while Monk declared himself happy with his team’s defensive performance, his opposite number, Thomas Christiansen, had spoken pre‑match of having identified some ways in which Leeds might effectively attack the Boro back-line.
“I like to keep it for myself,” Christiansen said cryptically when asked to identify those weaknesses. “But if you analyse the goals you will see one of them.”
• Wolves have sparkled en route to the top in the Championship this season but they had to show more grit than swagger in Saturday’s 2-0 win at Reading. They were on the back foot for long spells at the Madejski Stadium, reliant on John Ruddy’s heroics in goal, and on a weekend when only three of Saturday morning’s top 10 won (the top three, in fact), such doggedness offers further indication that a return to the top flight is imminent for Nuno Espírito Santo’s side. One of the other leading sides to win, Cardiff City, could be thankful that their opponents, Brentford, served up perhaps the most spectacular open goal miss of this or any other season in the Bluebirds’ 2-0 victory. Neal Maupay may take some time to live this one down. First-half goals from Joe Ralls and Danny Ward secured three points for Neil Warnock’s team.
• The bottom sides in the Championship had little to cheer. Sunderland may regard the confirmation of Chris Coleman as their new manager, on a two-and-a-half-year deal, as something of a coup but the side’s current frailties were again apparent in the 2-2 draw against Millwall, who have yet to win away this term. A sprightly start was swiftly undone by goalkeeping errors from Robbin Ruiter that gifted Neil Harris’s side a 2-1 lead before Adam Matthews secured a point. But Sunderland’s long winless home run goes on. Burton Albion and Bolton Wanderers remain in the bottom three alongside them, the former beaten at home by a superior Sheffield United on Friday and the latter drawing 0-0 at Preston North End on the same evening.
• The good times continue to roll at Shrewsbury Town. The surprise League One leaders won a supreme test of character at Rotherham United, Stefan Payne scoring in injury time to snatch victory for Paul Hurst’s side, who had played the final 37 minutes with 10 men after the dismissal of Abu Ogogo for a crude foul on Shaun Cummings. Shrewsbury were leading through Jon Nolan’s early goal at that point and, though Rotherham equalised through Richie Towell on 76 minutes, Payne’s close-range finish delivered a winning return for Hurst against the club for whom he played for 15 years. Shrewsbury’s win stretched their lead to four points, as second-placed Wigan Athletic lost 2-1 at home to fellow promotion contenders Bradford City in the division’s game of the day.
• In League Two Luton Town fans are perhaps getting better value for their season tickets than any other set of fans in the country. Saturday’s 7-0 shellacking of Cambridge United was the third time this season they have hit seven or more at Kenilworth Road, coming on top of an 8-2 win over Yeovil on the opening day and a 7-1 drubbing of Stevenage last month. They kept a clean sheet this time too, as Danny Hylton’s hat-trick took his tally to 11, the division’s joint highest, while Olly Lee scored from inside his own half. All of which is not bad for a side that saw two of their three top scorers last term, Jack Marriott and Cameron McGeehan, depart in the summer. The win took Luton up to second, two points behind Notts County, who saw off struggling Cheltenham Town 3-1 at Meadow Lane. Accrington Stanley slipped to third after being held 1-1 at home to Newport County.


After challenging for the title for the past couple of seasons, it was significant to hear Hugo Lloris contemplate looking over Tottenham Hotspur’s shoulder more than in front of them at the end of a derby defeat. “Oh, before we think about [the leaders] Man City it’s important to stay in the top four. This is the main target for our team,” he said. “We heard from outside that Tottenham play for the title, blah, blah, blah. The most important thing is to stay consistent in the league.” The difficulty imposing themselves on the most challenging away fixtures remains a sticking point. Having lost at Old Trafford and Arsenal in recent weeks, next month they visit the Premier League’s pace setters at the Etihad Stadium. Spurs found it hard to penetrate Arsenal’s defence, and when Mauricio Pochettino subbed off Harry Kane and Dele Alli neither could feel they had been at their most influential. “The spirit was good, we were in the fight and able to develop our game with the ball in the floor. But in the final third we need more aggression and movement,” Lloris said. “Now we need to carry on. It’s true that we wanted to do more against Manchester United and Arsenal. Unfortunately we couldn’t do that so now it’s important to have a run of victories because we need to keep our place at the top.” Amy Lawrence

When Callum Wilson broke his Premier League duck, it was with a hat-trick in a 4-3 win against West Ham United in August 2015. The future looked bright for the Bournemouth striker, but little has gone right for him since then. Two serious knee injuries in the space of two seasons were the cruellest of blows, curtailing the development of a richly promising career, and there must have been times when Wilson wondered if he would get back to his best, while Bournemouth suffered without his pace, movement and finishing. Against Huddersfield, however, Wilson gave Bournemouth a spectacular demonstration of what they have been missing in attack. The 25-year-old ripped the visitors apart, announcing his return to form with a hat-trick in a 4-0 win that carried Bournemouth towards calmer waters. It was the most cathartic of experiences for a very talented player. Jacob Steinberg

Strange as it sounds, Burnley are on course to finish this season with 70 points. Not that they are thinking of things that way. A team one point off fourth place and 17 ahead of the bottom-placed Crystal Palace are still concentrating on staying up. “The reality is still out there; 40 points is a big marker,” said Sean Dyche. Jack Cork echoed his manager. “We’ve just got to stay grounded and aim for that 40-point mark,” the goalscorer said. “After that, we can set new targets, but that will always be the aim.” Staying grounded has been a strength but carry on at their current rate and they will reach 40 on New Year’s Day. An ostensible focus on 40 points allowed Claudio Ranieri to deflect questions about Leicester’s surge two years ago. Burnley will not become the next shock champions but, like Leicester, their talk of avoiding relegation could prove a useful diversionary tactic. Richard Jolly

The Football Association is expected to refer footage of Oumar Niasse’s tumble to the turf on Saturday via the process for reviewing potential simulation incidents on Monday, with the three-man panel – comprising a former player, a former manager and a former official – to determine whether or not, in their opinion, the striker dived to win his team their early penalty. Each would examine the clip independently but their decision over whether this was “a clear and obvious case of simulation” would have to be unanimous for Niasse to incur a two‑match ban. Given the panel will presumably note the contact between Scott Dann’s shoulder and Niasse’s chest – there was no trip – and have been split on similar incidents involving Richarlison and Bernardo Silva to date this season, a ban seems improbable. “If they want to take action, good luck to them,” said the Crystal Palace manager, Roy Hodgson. “But I won’t get any satisfaction from it. It doesn’t change the result.” Dominic Fifield

Playing against Manchester City is perhaps not the best time to judge a side. On the one hand, you are likely to be beaten. On the other, you have the chance to prove yourselves against the likely champions. Let’s acknowledge, then, that Leicester gave Pep Guardiola’s team a game here. The 30 seconds that went from Harry Maguire hitting the post to Kevin de Bruyne killing the match was decisive, but until then the Foxes had been well in the game. Jamie Vardy and Riyad Mahrez both imposed themselves and the duel between the speed merchants Demarai Gray and Kyle Walker was Gray’s on points (thanks largely to one audacious backheel flick over Walker’s head). Most hopeful was the combination between Vicente Iborra and Wilfred Ndidi, the pair playing together for the third consecutive league match and forming a partnership of strength and athleticism.

Jürgen Klopp offered a simple explanation for Mohamed Salah’s transformation from the player who toiled at Chelsea into the Premier League’s leading goalscorer with Liverpool, and it had nothing to do with José Mourinho’s mistrust of young talent at Stamford Bridge. “Physicality,” the Liverpool manager proposed after the £36.9m signing took his tally to 14 goals in 18 games for his new club with two goals against Southampton. Klopp admits Salah’s disappointing spell at Chelsea may have served as motivation but he also believes that Liverpool, more importantly, bought the finished article from Roma this summer. “Maybe what happened [at Chelsea] was one reason he came back,” the manager said. “For sure he wanted to show he’s better than that, but everyone knew it already. He was a kid [21] when he went to Chelsea and in that time they were really successful. It was quite difficult to come through. A little bit less muscle, a little bit less physical, and you will fly through the Premier League – but not like he’s flying now. I mean, one body-check and you are flying out of the game. With his body shape that’s now different. He’s a man now. He was a kid at Chelsea, now he’s a man.” Andy Hunter

After Rafael Benítez saw Newcastle United lose following a mini Paul Pogba masterclass he remained in no doubt that the Frenchman is not yet in Steven Gerrard’s class. Of comparisons with the midfielder who was his captain when he managed Liverpool, the Spaniard said: “No, they are different. Stevie was a top-class player for so many years. He was very consistent and could make the difference in every game, with or without the ball. He was a top-class player. Pogba is a great player, but he still has to be consistent for years like Stevie was for 10 or 15 years.” Benítez, whose side are five points above the drop zone, was less sure if he will be granted money in January to strengthen. “I don’t know what will happen. I will keep working until January as hard as I can to improve my players, and if we can do something, we will. If not, I will try it improve the players that are available to me.” Jamie Jackson
Pogba’s performance in Manchester United’s 4-1 defeat over Newcastle reminded the Old Trafford supporters what they had been missing during his two-month layoff, his skill crucial to the equaliser and his timing vital to finish United’s third. At least his injury came at a time when league games were more sporadic – he has returned in time for an upcoming run of 10 league encounters in 37 days, a critical period in which just maybe that slick high-energy football of Pep Guardiola’s could come unstuck. If there is to be a title race in Manchester then Pogba is surely United’s answer to Kevin De Bruyne across the city; when the two teams finally meet on 10 December the buildup will inevitably focus on the managers’ rivalry, but it is via one of these two exceptional midfield talents that a potentially defining derby is most likely to be won.

Marco Silva clearly is not one for rushing new signings into his teams. Marvin Zeegelaar arrived at Watford from Sporting Lisbon on deadline day and in eight league games since had made the bench just twice, and never played. “Of course he had to adapt to a different country, a different culture,” Silva said. “He knows better now our style of play.” He made his first appearance against West Ham, while Will Hughes – who had an almost identical introduction to life in Hertfordshire, spending two of his first nine league games on the bench and the remainder out of the squad altogether – made a first home start. Both impressed, with Hughes giving Watford intriguingly contrasting options on the flanks. Richarlison rampaged down the left, Hughes offered angles and options on the right and without ever being static allowed the overlapping Kiko Femenía to do the serious running. He received a standing ovation when he was taken off in the 84th minute. “He deserved the moment,” Silva said. “He didn’t give up, even when he didn’t get in the squad. He tried to improve every day. It’s a good moment for him and I’m happy.” Simon Burnton

There was an amusing scene at the Hawthorns on Saturday just before the referee, Jon Moss, booked Claudio Yacob for a foul. Justifying his decision, Moss pointed to all the places where Yacob had committed similar offences after being introduced at half‑time. There were so many of them that the referee almost looked like a teacher doing a head-count at weekly assembly. This was Yacob’s first appearance since the Carabao Cup defeat by Manchester City in September, when his most memorable contribution to the game was an unruly tackle from behind on Ilkay Gundogan, who was making his first start after nine months out with a broken leg. There is, then, an objectionable side to Yacob’s game. But he also had an admirable dynamism, which is more than was shown by the man he replaced on Saturday, Grzegorz Krychowiak. The Pole has been an expensive disappointment since arriving on loan from Paris Saint-Germain. Paul Doyle

What have Barcelona, Valencia, Real Sociedad and Celta Vigo got in common? Anyone? Yes, of course they all play in La Liga. Think harder. OK, they’ve all scored more league goals than Real Madrid. It’s the kind of statistic that just won’t do at the home of the Spanish and European champions. You see, with Cristiano Ronaldo creaking in his old age and Gareth Bale seeing more of the physio’s room than the Bernabéu turf, Real’s goals are drying up.
To solve this problem, Real’s supreme leader, Florentino Pérez, is going to do what he always does in a time of crisis – throw a load of cash at another club in the hope they give them one of their best players. In this instance, the figure is £63m, the club is Manchester City and the player is Sergio Agüero. Pérez believes City will be more than happy to accept their offer for the 29-year-old if Pep Guardiola successfully snaffles Alexis Sánchez from Arsenal for a cut-price fee in January. It could even make City look like they’re taking FFP seriously. Real will also throw a £90m offer in for Atlético Madrid’s Antoine Griezmann, because they can, though he’s hardly in peak form having gone seven games without a goal.
Gareth Bale could head out of the Bernabéu as one or both of those are parachuted in, with Manchester United ready to part with £136m for both Griezmann (if Real don’t get him) and Bale because they haven’t spent a load of cash for at least four months and it really won’t do. They won’t stop there, either. With José Mourinho on the verge of signing a bumper new contract extension until 2020, the club will attempt to shower their manager with gifts in the form of good squad players. Chelsea’s Willian is one and Tottenham’s Danny Rose – who may finally get his wish of playing football near his mum’s house up north again – is the other. Meanwhile, Galatasaray want to take Marouane Fellaini to the Turk Telekom Stadium, perhaps so they can fire him out of a canon at Fenerbahce’s back-line in the next Istanbul derby.
Patrick van Aanholt may have to make the difficult choice between digging in for a relegation dogfight with Roy Hodgson at Crystal Palace or joining Pep Guardiola’s conga towards the Premier League title at Manchester City. Yup, it’s a tough one all right. The Spanish manager is not yet sure if he’s collected enough full-backs and, with Benjamin Mendy’s injury, he probably won’t be able to help himself. The 27-year-old would set City back a trifling £12m. And despite Liverpool having spent the entire Age of Pisces wooing Virgil van Dijk, Guardiola plans to ruin the most protracted courtship ever by joining the bidding for the Dutch Southampton defender in January.
City also have Riyad Mahrez in their sights after Lionel Messi said he didn’t want the Algerian to join Barcelona. He doesn’t seem against the idea of Mesut Özil coming to the Camp Nou, though. The club like the look of Özil’s assists and will offer André Gomes in exchange in their attempts to sign the Germany international, who seems to be good again this week.
It says here that Everton believe Watford boss Marco Silva is so talented he could lure players such as Edinson Cavani from PSG to Goodison Park. Presumably, they also think Silva can juggle water. So when the call comes Marco, no pressure.
Liverpool’s Daniel Sturridge is currently writing “Come and get me” on a Post-it note and will stick it on his head in January. He wants to go to the World Cup and being overlooked at Anfield is not helping his cause.
Chelsea, Liverpool and Arsenal are tracking the tricky Shakhtar Donetsk winger Bernard, because he is out of contract in the summer and who doesn’t want a player called Bernard? Chelsea have also sent spies to Atalanta to report back on the performances of centre-back Milan Skriniar and midfielder Antonio Candreva. Sticking with Serie A, Newcastle have the hots for Juventus midfielder Stefano Sturaro but his agent says the feeling isn’t mutual.
Thierry Henry might want to come up with a tenuous link for why he loves Wales (he could say he’s a fan of Gorky’s Zygotic Mynci) after being included on the Welsh FA’s shortlist to replace Chris Coleman as manager. It’s a left-field one, for sure. But the likelihood is that Ryan Giggs will finally get a job if he sees off competition for the Wales managerial position from Craig Bellamy.
And Bayern Munich want to take Sandro Wagner from Hoffenheim in January so that when they come back for the Bundesliga club’s tyro manager Julian Nagelsmann in the summer he will have a friendly face in his new squad.


Terry Bradshaw won four Super Bowls as Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback and it helped get him to the Hall of Fame. But no one would have guessed at his greatness after his first start, in which he completed just four passes.
Troy Aikman, another Hall of Famer with multiple Super Bowl wins, completed only seven passes in the first game of a first season in which he lost all 11 of his starts.
And please don’t forget Peyton Manning, who led the NFL with 28 interceptions in the first year of what will undoubtedly become a Hall of Fame career as well.
“Peyton had some difficulties,” Bill Polian, the Colts general manager who drafted Manning once told me. “Every rookie quarterback does in terms of getting used to the speed of the game and sophistication of the defenses and chemistry of working with the receivers. That was to be expected.”
Perhaps someday history will look at Buffalo Bills rookie quarterback Nathan Peterman’s first NFL start with the same sense. Because never in the league’s modern history, which is almost 50 years old, has a quarterback been as bad as Peterman was on Sunday. Playing against the Los Angeles Chargers, he attempted 14 passes in the first half, completing six of them to team-mates with five others ending up in the hands of his opponents.
Not surprisingly, Peterman didn’t have a second half, replaced by the man he was supposed to have made irrelevant, Tyrod Taylor.
Peterman’s start was perplexing to many around football, who noted that Buffalo actually came into the game with a 5-4 record and legitimate playoff hopes. It seemed an odd time to suddenly start a first-year quarterback who wasn’t even chosen until the fifth round of last spring’s draft. But Peterman had played well in replacing Taylor during a blowout loss to New Orleans last week and Buffalo’s rookie head coach, Sean McDermott, believed it was Peterman’s time to step up.
“He looks sharp and crisp,” McDermott told reporters late last week before the team left for California.
Then came Sunday’s game and Peterman looked anything but sharp and crisp. His five interceptions led to 24 Chargers points. At halftime, when he was pulled, Los Angeles led 37-7. Until Sunday, nobody since the NFL and AFL merged in 1970 has been intercepted five times in a half. Usually because their coaches had long benched them before they could get to that total.
McDermott showed remarkable restraint in leaving Peterman in as long as he did. Most coaches would have throw away their headsets and padlocked their quarterback to the bench after the second or the third interceptions – let alone the fifth. But McDermott appears especially attached to Peterman. Like many coaches new to a team (he had been the defensive coordinator in Philadelphia and Carolina) he wants his own quarterback, not someone he has inherited. Taylor is a player he was stuck with. Peterman is one he helped choose.
Which is why McDermott didn’t blast his quarterback after the game nor announce Peterman will go back to the bench. In fact, he sounded like he might actually be thinking of starting the hapless Peterman again next week.
“The decision was not about winning now but about the future,” McDermott said in his postgame press conference about the choice to start Peterman.
It seems a clear indication he isn’t looking to go back to Taylor – who threw for one touchdown and ran for another in the second-half – rather hoping that Peterman is the quarterback to whom he can attach himself for many seasons to come. If so, it might be a bold move. There’s really no good way to spin five interceptions and try as McDermott might, he can’t make them sound good.
Maybe, though, he will be fortunate. Maybe like Bradshaw, Aikman and Manning, a superstar looms below the Bills jersey. Maybe, Nathan Peterman will win Super Bowls.
“I’m going to learn a lot from this and make sure it never happens again,” Peterson told reporters after the game.
At least it can’t get any worse. Probably.
Ryan Fitzpatrick. A bit of hope for Peterman: Fitzpatrick threw six interceptions in a game last season, and still has a job in the league. On Sunday, there were better offensive performances than that of Fitzpatrick, filling in for injured Tampa Bay quarterback Jameis Winston. New Orleans’ Drew Brees and Washington’s Kirk Cousins both had more than 300 yards passing in their game. Detroit’s Matt Stafford fell one yard short of 300 and Minnesota running back Latavius Murray ran for 95 yards and two touchdowns.
But how often does Fitzpatrick get to be anybody’s player of the week? And quite frankly, he is as almost as deserving as the others. He completed 22 of 37 passes for 275 yards and two touchdowns with no interceptions. Fine numbers indeed. He also led the Buccaneers to a 30-20 victory at Miami. Given Fitzpatrick is on his seventh team and hadn’t been this precise in some time (he had 290 yards but with two interceptions in October) he seems a fine choice.
55. The number of years since the Cleveland Browns last went a whole game without a penalty – until Sunday. Amazingly, the winless Browns, the dreadful Browns, were perfect. At least in the eyes of the officials. It’s a mind-boggling statistic. Rare is the team who doesn’t have a hold or a pass interference or a late-hit. Penalties are all but impossible to avoid. And you would think a team as inexperienced as Cleveland’s would make plenty.
Maybe they should have committed a few. In addition to playing penalty-free they had a warm weather team, Jacksonville, in their frosty stadium by the lake with snowflakes swirling. None of this helped them. They lost a game they should have won, 19-7, when quarterback DeShone Kizer was sacked and stripped of the ball twice in the last 1:48.
For the Browns, even perfection isn’t perfect.
Dammit, hate to see this. Chris Thompson's season is probably over. Fun, exciting, talented player pic.twitter.com/yByPu9qEqm
This was horrible to watch and not just because a player had his leg crushed, but because Washington running back Chris Thompson is a fun guy to watch and was turning into a versatile offensive threat. He came into Sunday averaging 4.6 yards a rush and had 38 receptions and was a reason Washington believed they could still make the playoffs.
For a while on Sunday, Washington rallied behind their fallen player, converting a gutsy fake punt deep in their own territory right after he went down. But they were unable to hold a two-touchdown lead late in the game and were destroyed by the Saints’ Brees who completed 11 straight passes in two touchdown drives to tie the game just before the end of regulation. Brees led one last scoring drive early in overtime, leading to the field goal that beat Washington 34-31.
The Saints continue to look like a Super Bowl team with an 8-2 record while Washington fell to 4-6 and are tumbling from playoff contention.
“Hola, me llamo Roberto!”– Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski’s first line in the press conference after New England’s 33-8 trampling of Oakland in Mexico City.
As if you’d expect the Patriots top goofball to approach an international press conference with the solemnity of Bill Belichick or Tom Brady. Gronkowski went on to praise the fans at Azteca Stadium who were louder than those you hear at most NFL games. Of course it’s easy to enjoy a crowd when you are up 33-0 in the third quarter. It was another impressive win for the Pats who are 8-2 after their sluggish start.
The game might actually have been won last week. Rather than fly to Mexico a day or two before the game as teams traditionally do on road trips, Belichick had the team practice at the US Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, Colorado, which is 6,000 feet above sea level to prepare for Mexico City which is over 7,000 feet up. Belichick even wore an Air Force hoodie to his post-game press conference, a startling move given he was practically raised in the shadow of the Navy academy, where his father was a scout.
--We can safely say the Eagles are the best team in the NFC East, if not the entire league. They beat division rivals Dallas Cowboys 37-9 on Sunday Night Football. Carson Wentz struggled to complete passes early on but eventually found his rhythm, throwing for two touchdowns. His opposite number, Dak Prescott, was out of sorts and is struggling without the suspended Ezekiel Elliott to help him on offense. Prescott threw three picks and no touchdowns. The Eagles lost their kicker Jake Elliott to concussion and linebacker Kamu Grugier-Hill, a high school soccer player, stepped in to handle kick-off duties.
--Houston’s Tom Savage threw for 235 yards and running back D’Onta Foreman ran for two scores as the Titans beat Arizona 31-21, crippling any hopes the Cardinals had of remaining in the playoff picture.
--The Giants, who have looked miserable this season, managed to make Kansas City look woeful with three interceptions in a 12-9 overtime victory at home. The Chiefs, who looked like Super Bowl contenders early in the season, have now lost four of their last five games.
--One team who have managed to maintain the pace are Minnesota. They stifled the Rams’ surge, holding Los Angeles’s powerful offense to just 254 yards in a 24-7 victory that pushed the Vikings to 8-2.


It is just over two years since Australia beat England 33-13 in London to knock the hosts out of the Rugby World Cup. Since then it has been an entirely different: played five, won five at an average of just under 35 points per game. The squad floored by the Wallabies in 2015 – and England’s starting XV on Saturday contained eight survivors – has bounced back with a vengeance.
As Eddie Jones is well aware, there remains further scope for improvement. But this was a highly significant win psychologically, despite the fact that a record English margin of victory disguised the tightness of the contest. Even New Zealand do not have a more consistent recent record against the Wallabies and, if Samoa are put away this Saturday, England will have won 22 of 23 games under Jones’s stewardship.
As well as enhancing their self-belief it also ensures they remain the world’s second-ranked team, tucked in behind the All Blacks with power to add in 2018. As the lock Joe Launchbury, having enjoyed one of his more satisfying games at this level, said afterwards, the players are convinced there is more to come. “To get to where we want to get to you can’t afford to just sit in the shirt and put out mediocre performances,” the Wasps captain said. “If we want to be the best side we can be, we have to beat these teams around us.”
On a damp, difficult afternoon England were indeed in a higher gear than they ever managed against Argentina, defensively right up for it and sharper with the ball in hand. Among the great unanswered questions, however, is what would have unfolded had the Wallabies been awarded one or both of the contentious non-tries which, along with the first‑half yellow cards for Michael Hooper and Kurtley Beale, fundamentally shaped the contest.
Imagine if a more experienced and intuitive referee such as Nigel Owens had been in charge or footage of the ball clearly brushing the touchline whitewash had been available before Elliot Daly’s match-turning 54th-minute try. There is every chance Owens would have awarded Marika Koroibete’s try on the basis that Stephen Moore’s obstruction of Chris Robshaw was minimal or, at the very least, pinged England for an earlier offside. Hooper’s disallowed score was also marginal as the flanker made at least some attempt to stop and play himself back into an onside position. Beale’s binning for a supposed deliberate knock-down might have been only a penalty on another day.
All were fractional calls and could easily have gone either way. Rather than being 13-6 ahead with 10 minutes left England could have been 20-6 behind with Michael Cheika purring up in the stands. Would they have scored three tries in the last nine minutes under more pressurised circumstances? If they had done so, it would have been the finish to end them all.
In their five successive wins against Australia under Jones England have scored five first-half tries to the Wallabies’ six. After the interval they have registered 12 tries to Australia’s five. Regardless of a touch of good fortune here or there, England are regularly finishing stronger than their opponents, one of Jones’s non-negotiables.
“We trained to finish that last 20 minutes hard, whether it was the starting guys or the finishing guys,” the head coach confirmed. “You’ve just got to go through New Zealand’s record in the last five or six years; how many Test matches they’ve won in the last 20 minutes. That’s when it counts. You get in the contest in the first 20 and then you win the contest in the last 20.”
The only caveat when a replacement performs as outstandingly as Danny Care, whose deft kicking set up late tries by Jonathan Joseph and Jonny May before he scored one himself, is that maybe England would win games earlier if one or two of them started occasionally. Jamie George, Harry Williams, Sam Simmonds – all have put in enough hard work this autumn to merit a prominent role against Samoa, particularly if Jones, as he probably will, decides to cut his Lions players some slack.
Come the Six Nations, either way, selection will be fascinating. Mike Brown does not need telling that competition in the back three is intensifying, Launchbury is now a successful Test lineout caller and an increasing driving force all round, Courtney Lawes is undroppable, as is Maro Itoje. Billy Vunipola should be back from injury, along with the Lions Ben Te’o, Jack Nowell and Kyle Sinckler. If Lawes or Itoje switches to six, that leaves Robshaw, Sam Underhill and Simmonds competing for one place, with Hughes also rumbling off the bench.
With the whole squad now reassured that their hard training-ground work is paying off – and assuming they address their questionable game management when Australia had men in the sin-bin – their opponents should be wary.
“I think they look very assured in their roles,” Australia’s fly-half, Bernard Foley, said. “They’re a really quality side and they’re second in the world for a reason.” The Wallabies, who have decamped to Scotland without the injured Ned Hanigan (knee) and Adam Coleman (thumb), know England’s golden Cook Cup sequence is not just down to lady luck.

“Don’t give the bastard a drink. Let him die of thirst.”
Douglas Jardine’s mission was almost complete. England were about to complete a crushing series victory over Australia with a win in the fifth Test at Sydney in the famous Bodyline series of 1932-33. Jardine was at the crease, savouring the moment, when play stopped for a drinks break. The chivalrous Australian captain Bill Woodfull was about to hand Jardine some water when a lone voice suggested that it might be better to let his opposite number’s dehydration become terminal. Jardine, who had spent the entire series disparaging all things Australian, quietly enjoyed that particular bit of barracking. He later called it “one of the few humorous remarks which we were privileged to hear on this tour”.
Jardine is loathed more than any German who ever fought in any war
Jardine was characterised as the archetypal English villain, cold and calculating, the kind of man who would be played by Alan Rickman. “Jardine is loathed more than any German who ever fought in any war,” wrote Gubby Allen in a letter during the Bodyline tour, before adding: “Sometimes I feel I should like to kill [him] and today is one of those days.”
During the third Test at Adelaide, Jardine went to the Australian dressing-room to demand an apology because one of the Australian players had called Harold Larwood “a bastard”. He was met by Vic Richardson. “OK,” he said, turning round to his team-mates, “which of you bastards called Larwood a bastard instead of this bastard?”
When Jardine swatted a fly away from his face during one match, he was upbraided by a spectator. “Oi, leave our flies alone, Jardine – they’re the only flamin’ friends you’ve got here.” In his book, In Quest of the Ashes, Jardine devoted an entire chapter to his love of Australian crowds. “It is high time that full publicity was given to the evils of barracking,” he said. “One would expect that any genuine enthusiast would be tempted to tell the owner of an empty head and a pair of brazen lungs that he was spoiling the enjoyment of others round about him by going off at minute intervals like a raucous maroon. . . I cannot help thinking that a psychologist would find it extraordinarily interesting to experiment with an Australian barracker.”
The treatment of Jardine was a significant landmark in the development of Aussie barracking. When England try to win the Ashes in Australia, it is not so much 11 against 11 as 11 against 23 million. They have to compete with the entire country. The process of mental disintegration begins the moment they step off the plane – or even before, in the age of social media – and continues until they step back on it.
Every England cricketer who has played in Australia has a story to tell. Kevin Pietersen says he was “called a wanker 24/7” – and not just by his team-mates – while Stuart Broad was public enemy No1 throughout the 2013–14 series because he did not walk during the preceding Ashes. When the Australian-raised bowler Martin McCague hailed a taxi during the 1994–95 series, the driver spat: “You’re that bloody English traitor. Clear off. I’m not taking you.” Four years later, John Crawley was pummelled in an assault outside a bar in Cairns.
And these incidents took place outside the ground. Inside, the attitude tends to vary from affectionate contempt to outright hatred. Fielding in front of Bay 13 at the MCG, in particular, has become a rite of passage for callow English tourists. David Bairstow was once pelted with beer cans in an ODI at Sydney – and Australia weren’t even playing.
“A cricket tour in Australia would be the most delightful period in your life. . . if you were deaf,” said Larwood. He probably thought that, when the Bodyline tour finished, he would be returning to a bit of peace and quiet in England. He could not have been more wrong.


Casey Hayward made two of the Chargers’ five interceptions during a horrific first half by Buffalo rookie quarterback Nathan Peterman, and Los Angeles cruised to a 54-24 victory over the slumping Bills on Sunday.Korey Toomer returned Peterman’s first interception 59 yards for a touchdown on Buffalo’s opening drive, the rookie threw two more interceptions in the first quarter and two additional picks in the second. Peterman was pulled from his first NFL start with a 37-7 halftime deficit after just 14 pass attempts for the Bills (5-5), who lost their third straight.
Buffalo benched Tyrod Taylor and promoted the fifth-round pick from Pitt earlier this week despite being in playoff position. Coach Sean McDermott replaced Peterman with Taylor in the second half, and the veteran went 15 of 25 for 158 yards, throwing one TD pass and rushing for another score.
Tom Brady felt right at home in his first appearance in Mexico by throwing for 339 yards and three touchdowns, to the delight of an adoring crowd, in the New England Patriots’ 33-8 victory over the Oakland Raiders.
Brady completed his first 12 passes and picked apart Oakland’s suspect defense to chants of “Brady! Brady!” from an amped-up crowd at Azteca Stadium. The large contingent of Patriots fans in the well-divided crowd for a Raiders “home” game had plenty to cheer about as New England (8-2) dominated from start to finish.
The New Orleans Saints extended their winning streak to eight games with an unlikely comeback, erasing a 15-point deficit inside the final six minutes of regulation and kicking a short field goal in overtime to defeat Washington 34-31.
Mark Ingram capped a 131-yard rushing performance with gains of 20 and 31 yards on back-to-back carries in overtime to set up Wil Lutz’s winning 28-yard kick. Drew Brees passed for 385 yards and two touchdowns, going 11 of 11 for 164 yards and his only two touchdowns on New Orleans’ final two possessions of regulation. His first TD went to tight end Josh Hill with 2:53 to go and the last to Alvin Kamara with 1:05 left.
The Saints (8-2) set up their final drive with by stopping Samaje Perine on third-and-one at the two-minute warning when a first down would have allowed Washington (4-6) to run out the clock.
After Kamara had corralled a bobble while running between two converging defenders to score from 18 yards out, he took a pitch on a misdirection play to the left side and easily reached the end zone for a two-point conversion as the Superdome crowd – at least those who hadn’t left early – went wild.
Roger Lewis Jr made a spectacular catch to set up the winning 23-yard yard goal by Aldrick Rosas in overtime and the New York Giants responded from weeks of adversity to beat the AFC West-leading Kansas City Chiefs 12-9 on a blustery, cold afternoon.
The win snapped a three-game losing streak for the Giants (2-8) and sent the Chiefs (6-4) to their fourth loss in five games.
Wowwwwwwww.Roger Lewis makes the INCREDIBLE grab to setup the @giants WIN. #GiantsPride pic.twitter.com/YE9qsqlql5
The winning kick came two plays after Lewis was yanked to the ground on a deep pass from Eli Manning, but still caught the ball while flat on his back for a 34-yard completion on a fourth-down heave. Had he not caught it, flags flew for pass interference.
It was an unexpected was for a team that came into the game in turmoil, with questions about the future of coach Ben McAdoo and many wondering whether the Giants had quit in one-sided losses to the Rams and then the winless 49ers in the past two weeks.
Latavius Murray rushed for 95 yards and two touchdowns, Adam Thielen turned a short catch into a 65-yard score and the Minnesota Vikings smothered the NFL’s highest-scoring offense in a 24-7 win over the Los Angeles Rams.
Speed! 🔥🔥🔥 pic.twitter.com/3kGEd00GIp
Case Keenum completed 27 of 38 passes for 280 yards and no turnovers against the team that benched him last season for No1 overall draft pick Jared Goff. He also guided the Vikings (8-2) to their sixth straight victory in a matchup of division leaders.
Minnesota’s defense started the second half by forcing four punts in a row by the Rams (7-3), whose four-game winning streak in which they scored 144 points was finished in convincing fashion. The Rams led the league entering the weekend with a third-down conversion rate of 46.7%, but were just 3 for 11 against the Vikings.
Matthew Stafford threw for 299 yards and two touchdowns, Matt Prater kicked a 52-yard field goal with 1:35 remaining and the Detroit Lions held on to beat the Chicago Bears 27-24.
Detroit (6-4) took the lead after Tarik Cohen had tied it for Chicago (3-7) with a 15-yard touchdown run. Prater booted the winner after Stafford led a 42-yard drive to the 34. The Lions escaped with their third straight win when the Bears’ Connor Barth was wide right on a 46-yarder in the closing seconds.
The Baltimore Ravens forced five turnovers in their third shutout of the season, blanking the Green Bay Packers 23-0. Jimmy Smith, Eric Weddle and Marlon Humphrey each picked off passes for Baltimore (5-5), who led the NFL in interceptions entering the weekend.
Lambeau Leap for @Wallace17_daKid! #RavensFlock pic.twitter.com/QwAxPj7jHV
But a problematic offense couldn’t generate a touchdown drive until Joe Flacco’s perfect deep ball to Mike Wallace over two defenders for a 13-point lead nearly two minutes into the third quarter. Flacco threw for 183 yards, going 22 of 28 with an interception. His lone touchdown pass was still enough of a cushion against a Packers team struggling without Aaron Rodgers, out with a broken collarbone.
Blake Bortles threw a touchdown pass and Jacksonville linebacker Telvin Smith recovered a fumble for a TD with 1:14 remaining as the Jaguars won their fourth straight, 19-7 over the winless Browns and moved into sole possession of first place in the AFC South.
Jacksonville’s top-ranked defense forced five turnovers – two in the final two minutes. The Jaguars (7-3) built a 10-0 lead and turned things over to their “Sacksonville” defense. The Jaguars intercepted rookie DeShone Kizer twice, recorded five sacks and blanked the Browns (0-10) in the second half.
Rookie D’Onta Foreman ran for 65 yards and two fourth-quarter touchdowns before being carted off the field with an ankle injury to help the Houston Texans snap a three-game skid with a 31-21 win over the Arizona Cardinals.
The Texans (4-6) went on top when Foreman scored his first career touchdown on a three-yard run early in the fourth quarter. The Cardinals were stopped for a loss on a fourth-and-1 later in the fourth. Foreman dashed 34 yards on the next play to push the lead to 31-21 with about six minutes left.
Ryan Fitzpatrick threw for 275 yards and two touchdowns, Patrick Murray kicked a 35-yard field goal with four seconds remaining and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers snapped a six-game road slide by topping the penalty-prone Miami Dolphins 30-20.
O.J. Howard and DeSean Jackson caught those scoring throws for the Buccaneers, who outscored Miami 17-0 in the second quarter.
They also stuffed three straight one-yard-to-go runs by the Dolphins at the Tampa Bay 34 in the fourth quarter, forcing a turnover on downs on a day where Miami had more mistakes than points. Jay Cutler threw three first-half interceptions and didn’t play in the second half because of what the Dolphins said was diagnosed as a concussion.


Britain’s elite athletes “have fewer rights than an Uber driver” and desperately need an independent watchdog to protect them, the chair of the digital, culture, media and sport select committee has warned.
Damian Collins MP told the Guardian that the worrying number of bullying, sexism and racism cases inside the UK Sport system was directly linked to the lack of employment rights for athletes and it is not enough to hope for change to happen organically.
His comments come as Dame Katherine Grainger, the new chair of UK Sport, admits her organisation has faced “significant challenges” over the past 18 months that can no longer be brushed under the carpet. and
Speaking before the UK Sport’s World Class Performance conference, which begins in Manchester on Monday, Grainger said: “I recognise and accept that there have been a number of difficult issues across a range of sports in recent months that have challenged our system, and we have to rise to that challenge. These issues do not take away from the achievements of our athletes and coaches, but neither can we brush them under the carpet or just hope that they go away.”
Grainger said UK Sport was conducting a “root and branch review” of its policies following reports of a culture of fear in organisations as diverse as British Cycling, British Swimming, British Bobsleigh and British Gymnastics. “We have to aim to be the best in the world at athlete welfare, culture, governance and integrity just as we aim to be so in performance,” she said. “And we have to be seen to be the best in order to maintain public trust and pride in our achievements.”
However, Collins said more must be done to reform the culture of UK Sport – including an independent sports ombudsman, operating outside UK Sport’s control, which he believes is “desperately needed”.
“We’ve seen too many cases of sports bodies effectively marking their own homework,” said Collins, whose DCMS select committee has recently investigated bullying and misclassification in paraports and the Football Association’s disastrous handling of the Eni Aluko affair. “There’s basically no outside scrutiny. If there was, they would have better procedures in place.”
“One of the big things that has come out is that athletes don’t have very many rights in the face of the governing body of the sport in which they participate,” he said. “In many ways they have fewer rights than an Uber driver has and that has been at the heart of the problem.
“Because they don’t really have those rights, the governing bodies have got away with not having the sort of proper grievance procedures that would be normal in a lot of professional workplaces. That is something that needs to change.”
As things stand, elite British athletes are not treated as employees by UK Sport but rather as recipients of grants. The sports minister, Tracey Crouch, in her appearance in front of the DCMS select committee last week, stopped short of backing the idea of changing this, calling it a “complex issue”.
Crouch did acknowledge that she was considering the ombudsmen idea, as recommended by Dame Tanni Grey-Thompson in a review into the culture of British sport in April.
Collins also urged UK Sport to bring in far better whistleblowing procedures. “There has to be a way for people to bring in concerns and at the moment it just doesn’t exist,” he said, pointing out that Crouch had not been able to name a single sport with appropriate whistleblowing procedures when she spoke to the DCMS select committee.


The Wallabies are in danger of gaining a reputation as the ugly Australians.
Wallabies coach Michael Cheika’s incandescent rage against the refereeing in Australia’s record 30-6 loss to England at Twickenham on Sunday morning was an unpleasant, but recurring, feature of the game. The Wallabies have now lost five straight Tests against England, including four defeats last year. Cheika has heavily criticised the refereeing after each loss.
At Twickenham, Cheika’s anger over the refereeing was on full display during the course of the game, overshadowing the match itself. Cheika applauded ironically when Wallabies captain Michael Hooper was denied a try by the television match official (TMO) for being offside, and appeared to mouth the words “fucking cheats.”
He was again beside himself after Hooper, now the most yellow-carded player in Test history, and fullback Kurtley Beale were sin-binned in the first-half. And when an English television reporter tried to raise the alleged “cheats” comment with Cheika after the game, he walked out of the interview in disgust.
It is the second week in a row a Test coach has been caught swearing on television after England coach Eddie Jones called his players “fucking stupid” during their unconvincing win against Argentina. The difference was the apologetic Jones’ ire was directed at his players, while Cheika was seething over the refereeing.
Is this really the image Australian rugby union wants to project to the world? And is this kind of behaviour helpful or harmful to the Wallabies’ chances of winning the 2019 World Cup in Japan?
To be sure, the Wallabies were on the wrong side of several controversial decisions by New Zealand referee Ben O’Keeffe and the TMO.
First, a kick by England halfback Ben Youngs was viewed several times by the TMO to see whether the ball had gone out before a try was awarded to winger Elliot Daly. Then, Wallabies winger Marika Koroibete had a potentially match-levelling try disallowed in the 70th minute after replacement hooker Stephen Moore was penalised for obstruction. This was the turning point in the game. Two minutes later England outside-centre Jonathan Joseph slid over to score after regathering a brilliant kick by replacement halfback Danny Care. At 20-6, that was pretty much the game.
The fact England received the rub of the green on all of these important decisions may have been too much for Cheika to bear, but each of the decisions was correct. What are a referee and a TMO to do? Even up the 50/50 calls to maintain the appearance of fairness, or call the game as they see it?
At the moment, Cheika has the look of a man who feels the world is against him and seems to be adopting a siege mentality. If this is a deliberate strategy, Cheika may need to re-think it, because he runs the risk of putting the world’s best referees offside. Even if it is just a matter of Cheika losing his cool, it is an issue that Rugby Australia needs to address.
By focusing too much on the refereeing, the Wallabies are in danger of overlooking their own short-comings.
Both Cheika and Jones learned their craft on the sun-baked turf of Coogee Oval, and they often espouse the virtues of Randwick’s famous running game. But Jones is an older and wiser coach these days. On a cold, rainy day at Twickenham England played wet weather football, while the Wallabies tried to play with the ball in hand, making handling errors in the slippery conditions. The inability of the Wallabies to react quickly to England’s deft tactical kicking was a major cause of their downfall.
Another cause for concern for the Wallabies was how badly they fell away at the end of the game, conceding 17 unanswered points in the last 24 minutes.
When both teams went to the bench England were clearly superior. Jones referred to his replacements as “finishers”, the term Cheika once used to describe his substitutes.
The Wallabies play Scotland at Murrayfield in their last Test of the year next Sunday. Perhaps it will serve as a reminder of Australia’s great escape against the Scots in the quarter-final of the 2015 World Cup after a controversial refereeing decision – a time when the world was not seemingly out to get them.


David Moyes has appealed for unity among West Ham United supporters after watching his new team slump to a 2-0 defeat at Watford in his first match, leaving them marooned in the relegation zone.
A number of fans made their feelings known throughout the game, with Will Hughes’s opening goal in the 11th minute greeted with a chorus of “sack the board” as West Ham made a nightmare start under the Scot in his first appointment since leaving Sunderland early last summer. Andy Carroll was also singled out for criticism by a large section of away supporters when he was withdrawn in the second half soon after Richarlison had doubled Watford’s lead and Moyes, who replaced Slaven Bilic as manager during the international break, admitted they will have to get behind the team if West Ham are to rescue themselves from their second-worst start to a Premier League season. “I don’t know the history and all the reasons for it but I have to say we need them now,” the manager said.
“We need a united club. I know that’s hard if you have grievances but I said to the players at the end that it’s hard to play when the crowd’s like that. The small things can make a big difference but I can understand their frustration because we didn’t play well enough. We need to find a way to make sure we get the club together.”
Moyes, who is looking to relaunch his career after disappointing experiences at Manchester United, Real Sociedad and Sunderland, pointed the finger at West Ham’s “big names”.
“I always thought this was a big job,” he said. “Some big players with big reputations disappointed me a lot. I thought they would show me more. They need to show me why they have got that reputation. Overall it was not good enough.”
Watford, who ended their run of three successive defeats under Marco Silva, fully deserved their victory despite heroics from the goalkeeper Heurelho Gomes when he twice denied West Ham an equaliser. But the Portuguese manager was noncommittal over whether he will still be in charge for Saturday’s trip to Newcastle following reports that he is Everton’s main target to succeed Ronald Koeman at Goodison Park, with two attempts to agree a compensation fee already believed to have failed. “What I can control and what stays in my hands is to plan the next session tomorrow and I will be at the training ground tomorrow,” Silva said.
“I know the speculation and some of you put in doubt about my commitment but my players gave a very good answer today. I don’t want to talk anything more about the situation. What I can control is my team and I will be at training for the next session on Monday.”


Max Allegri’s decision to rest Gianluigi Buffon and Andrea Barzagli backfired as Juventus lost valuable ground on Napoli with a 3-2 defeat at Sampdoria, who stay sixth, five points behind their opponents.
Buffon and Barzagli were left on the bench after Italy’s emotional World Cup failure, and watched as the home side raced into a three-goal lead. Duván Zapata opened the scoring in the 52nd minute before Lucas Torreira and Gianmarco Ferrari added two goals in eight minutes to effectively seal an impressive win.
Juventus rallied in injury time through a Gonzalo Higuaín penalty and a second from Paulo Dybala, but it was not enough as they slipped four points behind Napoli. Maurizio Sarri’s side beat Milan 2-1 at home on Saturday, goals from Lorenzo Insigne and Piotr Zielinski extending their unbeaten start.
On Sunday evening, Internazionale defeated Atalanta 2-0 at the San Siro to climb into second place. Mauro Icardi scored both goals with his head to take his personal tally this season to 13 goals in 13 league games. Luciano Spalletti’s team are also unbeaten this term, with 10 wins and three draws so far.
Radja Nainggolan was labelled a “superhero” by Roma manager Eusebio di Francesco after scoring the winner in the Rome derby. Nainggolan put Roma 2-0 up over Lazio after Diego Perrotti’s opener, with Ciro Immobile pulling one back. Roma climbed above their local rivals and are two points behind Juve with a game in hand.
At the other end of the table, Benevento were denied their first point of a dismal campaign by an injury-time winner from Sassuolo to steal a 2-1 win. Federico Peluso won it for the visitors four minutes into injury time to leave promoted Benevento with 13 defeats from 13.
Valencia won their eighth league game in row at Espanyol to remain unbeaten and move six points ahead of Real and Atlético Madrid, who drew 0-0 on Saturday, in the race behind leaders Barcelona.
Goals from Geoffrey Kondogbia and Santi Mina sealed victory in the second half after Marcelino was sent from the dugout for dissent. The Valencia coach will be absent from the touchline for the visit of Barça.
Gerard Moreno struck the post for Espanyol while Sergio García and former Valencia man Pablo Piatti also narrowly missed the target. Kondogbia broke the deadlock against the run of play with a fierce shot from the edge of the area in the 66th minute, before Mina pounced on a defensive error late on.
On Saturday, Luis Suárez ended a goal drought spanning five games by scoring twice in Barcelona’s 3-0 win over Leganés to keep them four points clear of Valencia.
The Uruguayan reaped the benefits of two weeks’ rest after being left out of his country’s internationals and pounced from close range to give Barça the lead in the 28th minute, after the Leganés goalkeeper, Iván Cuéllar, failed to hold a shot from Paco Alcácer.
Suárez doubled Barcelona’s lead on the hour by sliding to send another rebound beyond the hapless Cuéllar and was twice denied a hat-trick. Substitute Paulinho poked in the third in stoppage time for his fourth goal of the season.
There was one negative for Barça, however, as Gerard Piqué picked up a fifth yellow card of the season and is now suspended for the top-of-the-table meeting at Valencia, adding to the absence of fellow centre-back Javier Mascherano.
The German league’s top scorer, Robert Lewandowski, struck twice as Bayern Munich eased past Augsburg 3-0 on Saturday to make it eight wins in eight games in all competitions under Jupp Heynckes and open up a six-point lead at the top of the table.
Lewandowski grabbed Bayern’s second goal not long after Arturo Vidal’s 31st-minute opener and added another early in the second half, to take his league tally to 13 goals. The Poland striker has now scored 18 times against Augsburg in 13 Bundesliga matches, more than against any other club.
Augsburg were bold and matched Bayern for half an hour before Vidal turned and fired in from close range for the lead. The Chilean then sent Lewandowski through with a defence‑splitting pass to double it. The Pole then volleyed in a perfect Joshua Kimmich cross four minutes after the restart.
Schalke are up to second, six points behind Bayern, after a 2-0 victory over visitors Hamburg on Sunday. A penalty from Franco Di Santo and Guido Burgstaller’s 78th-minute goal saw Schalke move above RB Leipzig on goal difference. Di Santo converted his spot kick, awarded for a foul on Yevhen Konoplyanka, for his first league goal since March 2016. Hamburg hit the post early in the second half and pushed for an equaliser before Burgstaller sealed victory after more good work from Konoplyanka.
Leverkusen denied Leipzig an away win on Saturday as they twice came from a goal down to earn a 2-2 draw, with Kevin Volland netting the equaliser in the 74th minute. Leverkusen played most of the second half with 10 men after the dismissal of Benjamin Henrichs.
Borussia Dortmund, the leaders a few weeks ago, are in complete free fall, having dropped to third, on 20 points, after their 2-1 loss at VfB Stuttgart on Friday, their fourth league defeat in their past five matches.
Wolfsburg notched their first win under coach Martin Schmidt, after seven successive draws, beating Freiburg 3-1 to climb to 13th. Hoffenheim missed their chance to go third, needing a stoppage-time equaliser through Mark Uth to rescue a 1-1 draw against Eintracht Frankfurt, and are fourth on 20 points.


Lee Dixon tells an eye-opening story in the film 89 about being pinned up against the wall of the dressing room by his own team‑mates before his first north London derby. He was warned, in no uncertain terms, that if he did not perform in this game of all games he would be in trouble. It is hard to imagine that in the modern game such threats would be part of a pre-match routine, but the words said within the Arsenal camp last week to gee them up for the visit of Tottenham Hotspur certainly had a motivating effect.
In the intensity of their play, in their body language, this was a different kind of Arsenal to the one that has a tendency to freeze up and feel the fear creeping in during high-pressure games. They seemed to relish the situation. Héctor Bellerín let out some kind of primal roar as he headed down the tunnel at half-time in recognition of a two-goal lead his team would not relinquish. Mesut Özil at one point hoiked an agricultural clearance 40 yards straight up into the air – as un-Özil-esque a technique as you could ever imagine – to clamourous acclaim. Alexis Sánchez rediscovered his appetite for careering around the pitch chasing every cause going.
One of the key figures in galvanising Arsenal was an unexpected one. Shkodran Mustafi has had a mixed experience since joining the club in the summer of 2016. Some promising performances, some ropey ones, spells out injured, suggestions the German might even move on after one so-so season. Mustafi had been absent for seven weeks before being recalled to the three-man defensive unit that formed the platform for Arsenal to take on a Spurs side generally billed as favourites pre-match. He tackled a vital game as if it mattered to every fibre of his being.
Afterwards he contemplated the question that foreign players might not be perceived as caring about a derby as much as locally born counterparts. His no-nonsense reply suggested the old fashioned pin-your-team-mate-against-the-wall routine might chime with his wholehearted personality.
“That’s you guys thinking it,” he said. “As always – Arsenal is dead. Arsenal is not coming back. It’s always the same. It’s about what the team is thinking and feeling. We keep saying it that we are always alive, we always believe in ourselves, we always try to give everything on the pitch. Obviously when it comes to games like this you have to show character. We showed a great character, when we had the ball but also when we didn’t have it.”
Their efforts without the ball were cranked up and what a difference that made as a foundation for a strong performance. When they got the benefit of some tight calls by the officials they were in the mood to make the most of it.
Arsène Wenger was particularly complimentary about Mustafi’s influence, vocally as well as his impact reading the game with obvious determination at both ends of the pitch. “He’s a leader, he’s a motivator,” the manager said. The unit, with Mustafi alongside Laurent Koscielny and Nacho Monreal, snuffed out the attack of Harry Kane, Dele Alli and Christian Eriksen, and Wenger liked the leadership that came from the back. “Sometimes one word – ‘go a bit more wide, go a bit more left, drop off’ – makes a complete difference. Because it’s like you have a photo of a team when you play at the back.”
Mustafi thinks Arsenal must strive to hit those levels more regularly. “It’s about being consistent. That’s our goal every day in training because you are only as good as your last game. If you win today and lose next weekend you are back where you were.”
Mustafi’s straight-talking was evident as he responded to queries about how close he came to leaving Arsenal during the summer. “You [reporters] like to get the shit, the biggest shit. That’s your job,” he said. “People outside, talking and thinking that they know everything. What happens in the changing room is the real thing.
“I don’t understand why people just talk about things they cannot know about. If I have been talking to clubs or if I haven’t, it’s only rumours. Obviously there are so many newspapers, they need something to write because it’s boring if the paper is empty.”
Having helped the defence to do their job, Mustafi enjoyed how Arsenal’s front trio of Sànchez, Özil and Alexandre Lacazette pushed high up the pitch to put their opponents under pressure. How important are Sanchez and Özil to this team? “You want everyone to leave, don’t you? We need the players, not everyone can leave. They are big players. Alexis, Mesut, they can create chances and score goals. Obviously everyone in the team wants them to stay here but in the end they choose. It’s their careers and they choose what decision they make.”
Emotions ran high on both sides of the north London divide. Mauricio Pochettino aired his frustrations, with officials, himself, and although he is not keen to criticise his team, he did acknowledge they were not at their best. “I am disappointed. When you beat Real Madrid everybody is so happy even though we made a lot of mistakes. It is different when you lose, you are disappointed. But it is not only about criticising the referee. It is about criticising ourselves because we needed to do better.”
The predicted power shift in north London remains on hold.


“If the ball goes on the left foot then you just try it,” said a typically relaxed Kevin De Bruyne on Saturday evening. “Sometimes it comes off and sometimes it doesn’t. It’s the same with the outside, the inside. It helps if you can do different types of things, sometimes you might put spin on it. But I’m not scared to shoot with my left foot, obviously.”
Obviously. The Belgian’s left foot decided this match; his shot from outside the Leicester City area hitting the roof of Kasper Schmeichel’s net at a speed that just did not seem feasible. It was the sort of goal that causes cheeks to puff out in astonishment and increasingly what people are hoping to see when they watch Manchester City play. Yes your team might get a chasing but there will be moments of virtuosity you won’t forget. When De Bruyne was substituted in the 89th minute, he was applauded from all sides of the King Power Stadium.
For a player who increasingly looks like a superstar, De Bruyne hardly acts like one. It’s not like he is modest, but he is grounded, and so matter-of-fact as to be both endearing and just a little disappointing. There’s no Ibra-esque talk of lions and immortality, just a clear-eyed focus on process and practice. That, of course, is the way Pep Guardiola likes it.
“It’s freedom but everybody has their position‚” De Bruyne said of the gameplan. “I know when Kyle [Walker] is going up and Raheem [Sterling] is going inside I have to take care of the winger for the counter. If I am more up then Kyle is going to stay and Raheem is going to be outside. It’s fluidity in the team but knowing what you need to do at the right time.
“We just have to try and see where the spaces are and then take advantage of it. Every game is going to give us something else and probably today was more on the left but I think Raheem came more inside as a result and the first goal he created was very good.”
Indeed it was. Sterling made the opener just before half-time with a piece of play that was David Silva-like. Playing a one-two with De Bruyne, the England man then dinked a ball between centre-half and full-back that completely turned the Leicester defence. Breaking beyond that back-line with a Sterling-esque dash was Silva. He cut the ball across goal for Gabriel Jesus, who simply couldn’t miss.
City have the same number of points after 12 games, 34, as Roberto Mancini’s title-winning side of 2011-12. They have a better goal difference, by virtue of conceding fewer goals. But the talk is already of a new bar being set for the league in terms of style of play and questions are being asked as to whether City can now go the entire season unbeaten (for the record, Arsenal’s Invincibles had 30 points at this stage).
The fluidity and systematic understanding throughout Guardiola’s team lends credibility to such talk. As does the fact that City have one of the most expensive squads in the history of the game. The City manager fumed at losing John Stones to a hamstring strain on the half hour. It was an injury he blamed on the defender playing 90 minutes in both of England’s recent friendlies. Guardiola will now look to recruit a new defender in January but, for all of that, the substitute Eliaquim Mangala did a good job of standing in. The Frenchman, making only his second league appearance of the season, cost the club £32m three seasons ago.
Vincent Kompany also made his return to the side, though in his case after injury (sustained on international duty, which again drew Guardiola’s ire). The Belgian was lucky not to be sent off in just the third minute when his tackle brought down Jamie Vardy. Claude Puel felt it was the game’s crucial moment, Kompany felt Stones was providing adequate cover to prevent a goalscoring opportunity. “It was a good run from Vardy. I thought: ‘I’ll just use my joker now,’” Kompany said.
The club captain may not be as vital to his team’s prospects as he once was, but the experience he has accrued in winning two Premier League trophies should prove invaluable over the coming months. Asked whether this team are playing the best football he has seen in his nine years at the club, Kompany said: “Maybe at this moment, but I want to remain on the cautious side, because we don’t have any silverware to show for it. At the moment we haven’t done anything special, we’ve just put ourselves in a good position to go and do something great.”


Zlatan Ibrahimovic has revealed the career threatening injury he sustained in April was more than the “significant knee ligament damage” that Manchester United characterised it as being at the time.
The Swede made his comeback in the 4-1 win against Newcastle United at Old Trafford on Saturday, entering proceedings on 77 minutes as a replacement for Anthony Martial. It was the 36‑year‑old’s first action since sustaining the injury on 20 April playing against Anderlecht in the Europa League.
While the problem was considered grave enough to question whether Ibrahimovic would play again, he stated it was actually more dire than previously known. “If people knew the real injury, they would be in shock that I was even playing. It was more than the knee but I will keep it personal – that’s why I choose not to talk of it,” he said.
“In my recovery I have not rushed anything; I have been out for six and half months. I have been following protocol and my schedule day by day. The only secret has been working hard. Those close to me know what I have been doing. I was working five, six hours a day.
“When it happened I said giving up was not an option. My only focus was on coming back and coming back better. I know it’s my head playing, not my knee; my knee has to follow. With my experience and career I know what I have to do but I feel good. I am very proud of the moment to play again and for everyone around me because I wouldn’t have done it alone. Thanks to the supporters for keeping me motivated, the coach who’s trusted me, the club that believes in me and my family obviously.”
Ibrahimovic received a rousing reception. “It was an amazing reaction from fans but I felt it from day one,” he said. “From the first step in the warm-up, with people singing and cheering for you, it’s what keeps you going. This was not a one-man work, it was everyone’s and thanks to them that I am back on field and can play.”
Paul Pogba also made his comeback from a hamstring injury and was instrumental in United’s victory. Rafael Benítez’s side took the led through a 14th-minute Dwight Gayle goal before Pogba took over.
First he created Antony Martial’s 37th-minute equaliser by driving down the right and crossing for the Frenchman to head home. Then, after Chris Smalling put United ahead just before half-time, Pogba scored United’s third on 54 minutes following a smart Marcus Rashford header. Romelu Lukaku broke a personal seven-game drought on 70 minutes for his 17th of the season as José Mourinho’s team kept the gap to the leaders, Manchester City, to eight points.
Of being able to overhaul Pep Guardiola’s side, Ibrahimovic said: “We can chase City. Why is it not a possibility? We are all here because we want to win and we need to because they are first.”
On Pogba he said: “I can talk of what Paul brings – big quality. It was like he hasn’t been injured for a month. He brings such big quality, a different quality, and I bring experience and mine. I try to help the guys as much as possible and do what I can.”
Marcos Rojo, who sustained a serious knee injury in the same game as Ibrahimovic, also returned to the match-day squad. “This week the manager’s been very happy because he has a full team for the first time this season and as a coach you want those opportunities and alternatives to make changes,” Ibrahimovic said. “We just need to pick and choose. He knows what he is doing even when the number of players are limited because he’s a winner and has been winning every season.”
Ibrahimovic believes United can win the title and the Champions League. “I think there is a possibility for everything. We were early into it [side’s development] last year and won two trophies and we are stronger this season. We believe we can do it. To win and get the trophies.”
Regarding whether he will extend his one-year contract the forward said: “At the moment I am just thankful I can play football again. I don’t know what the future brings but what happens happens. I am at the age where I can choose what I want to do. I don’t sign five- or 10-year deals. I am just happy to be back playing and doing what I am good at.
“José said: ‘Do whatever you want. I trust in you and you know what you have to do.’ So I was not worried. The contract is all paperwork and I do the physical work.”
Ibrahimovic did not sign on for United again until August. “Even if I had a contract or not, I needed to train. The other’s up to the other people,” he said. “I knew I would stay because I wanted to stay. The numbers have never been an issue. I could’ve signed a deal after two months but didn’t because I am honest with myself. I want to stay because I can perform.”


For years Tony Pulis has been the safest managerial bet in the Premier League. But that seems to be changing. The fact now facing West Bromwich Albion’s Chinese owners, led by Guochaun Lai, is that sticking with Pulis represents a considerable risk. So, of course, does sacking him, a decision that looks on the cards after the home drubbing by Chelsea. But which option is more dicey?
Lai made it clear when fronting the takeover of the club in September 2016 – at a cost of around £175m – that the new owners had no wish to make gambling a habit. What attracted them most to West Brom was the club’s stability, the Baggies having been a solid mid-table side for half a decade after years of yo-yoing between the top-flight and the second-tier.
Owning a Premier League club gives the owners extra kudos as they pursue housing development contracts in China, their main business. Dropping out of the Premier League, by contrast, would be a serious blow to prestige and finances. That is intolerable for the owners. But with their team winless since August and performances deteriorating, it has become a real prospect, despite Pulis’s proud record of never being relegated.
West Brom fans do not care about housing development contracts in China. It is interesting to wonder whether they are even particularly bothered about being relegated if the price of staying up is being bored by Pulis’s no-frills football. What is clear is that with results now as bad as the entertainment value, no one is getting what they want from West Brom. Apart from opponents. The principal interests of the owners and fans appear to be converging and that spells bad news for the manager.
Pulis used his programme notes for the Chelsea match to mount a robust defence of his stewardship, insisting, nonetheless, that he was reluctant to do so because he dislikes referring to the past, preferring to look to what can be achieved in the future. But his vision is precisely what annoys West Brom fans. Nothing suggests he foresees a day where he will regularly send out a team to be proactive. He has spent this season pioneering a formation in which three central defenders are protected by three plodding central midfielders.
West Brom have the lowest average possession of any team in the Premier League – 36.76% – and have had fewer shots on target than everyone bar Swansea. Even at Huddersfield, who played most of the match with 10 men after Christopher’s Schindler’s red card, Pulis’s team could not muster the majority of possession and ended up deserving losers.
Saturday’s programme also included features on great West Brom matches from the past, such as when they beat Mario Kempes’s Valencia in the 1979 Uefa Cup. West Brom were among English football’s great entertainers back then. The Three Degrees and all that. This is not a club where supporters pine continually for bygone glories or feel entitled to demand silverware. But they expect to see ambition, a convincing attempt to make a football match more than a reality check. No one goes to the cinema to watch the news. A spot of yo-yo action might even be bearable if delivered with a little gusto.
Pulis’s wildest dream is a 1-0 win. He got enough of them during his first season at West Brom to achieve good positions. But never in a manner that generated goodwill. Which is why, now that results have dipped, many West Brom fans are pleading for change. In recent performances it has even looked like some players are struggling to summon the inspiration to apply basic instructions.
Chelsea’s four goals owed much to the ingenuity of Álvaro Morata, Eden Hazard and Cesc Fabregas, but also to the slovenliness that has crept into West Brom’s play, notably the uncharacteristic absence of set-piece marking that enabled Marcos Alonso to join Hazard and Morata on the scoresheet. Lai, having flown in from China to watch the match, must have noticed the air of weariness and irritation around The Hawthorns.
For Chelsea, meanwhile, things are looking up. Following the victory against Manchester United, this result made it two from two matches since the 3-0 Champions League defeat at Roma. Antonio Conte suggests that match has stimulated a change and may turn out to be as significant a turning point as last season’s loss to Arsenal. Conte altered his formation after that defeat and embarked on a run that took them to the title. The switch since Roma has not been as radical, more to do with mindset and pushing Hazard close to Morata.
“In every season there are games where you have to understand if this is the right way to the wrong way,” Conte said.


Danny Care is one of the best running scrum‑halves in the world but I was really pleased with how he contributed in different ways against Australia. He is obviously a good mate of mine. I played alongside him for a long time and now coach him at Harlequins and what we saw at Twickenham were the fruits of Danny maturing as a player as he has got older.
He has worked really hard on seeing the space in behind and when the opportunities are there in the big games, he really nails it. A recent Premiership match against Sale stands out in my mind – he was spot-on at identifying that space. He has that ability to put the ball over the top and put it on the money, as we saw at Twickenham.
It was clear that against Australia he added a little bit more tempo, he got the ball away nice and quickly and you could see the team go to another level. He played on the fact that Australia were mentally and physically a bit all over the place and sucked of energy. He got England into another gear, the floodgates opened a little and he capped it off with a great try.
Looking for space in behind and nailing those kicks – as we saw for the tries for Jonny May and Jonathan Joseph – has been a big work-on for Danny. At Quins we are playing with a lot more width and that means Danny needs to get in there and get the pass away a lot more. A big part of his game is his running strength and we don’t want to take that away from him but I think it will make him a better player, having the ability to get the pass away and choosing the right time to put the ball in behind, then choosing the right time to run – it all combines to manipulate the defence a little bit more.
He is such a dangerous runner around those fringes and, of course, you want to see more of it because it’s fantastic to watch. But being able to mix it up, pick and choose his times to go or to kick and pull the defence around can be such a string to his bow because he’s got a fantastic offensive kicking game. He has worked really hard on that and has a knack of seeing the space and putting the ball exactly where he wants to.
His box-kicking has really improved, too, and that is another sign of his maturity. That has also been a big work-on for him. He’s really improved in that area and it makes him a more well-rounded No9, a guy that can do a bit of everything. He knows when to do things at the right time, which was epitomised against Australia. There was space in behind and he saw it. He didn’t need to run; he didn’t need to pass. All he needed to do was put the ball where it needed to be, with good communication and awareness, and then you get the results.
Make no mistake, Danny might be a brilliant finisher as Eddie Jones calls them but he would still love to be starting for England. That desire is still as fierce as ever. No one wants to be sitting on the bench for his country – I did it for years and hated it – but the important thing is that you know your role.
You are always disappointed for a little while but you have to park that and make sure that during the week you know exactly what you need to do when you come on. Then you’ve got to be constantly watching the game, feeling the game, seeing how it changes, getting a sense of the intensity of both sides and what is needed.
It is a big role for these guys coming on now because they do change games. Danny is fantastic at it but there is still that drive to get that starting spot and, if he keeps coming on and performing like he did on Saturday, he is going to put a lot of pressure on Ben Youngs and cause Eddie a headache.
I definitely felt, though, that the timing was right for the bench to make an impact. It escalated pretty quickly from a tight, intriguing game for those first 60 minutes because Australia ran out of steam and that was down to the relentless physicality of England.
Against Samoa on Saturday I’d expect there would be some changes because it is the perfect time to give some of the players on the fringe a start. Danny is not on the fringe; he’s a big part of the squad. and very experienced, But it is a chance for him to show what he can do and for other guys as well.
We are two years out from the World Cup and Eddie needs to see some of the others playing some top-level rugby. All of a sudden it will be the Six Nations, a tough tour of South Africa and then you are 15-16 months away from the World Cup and you don’t want to be thinking then about building combinations. It is the perfect opportunity to test some guys who should be there, in and around the World Cup squad, to see how they cope under a bit of pressure.


Eddie Jones has challenged his England side to make further history by clinching a record third consecutive Six Nations title next year and has given his strongest indication yet that Dylan Hartley is set to continue as captain.
Hartley, the only player to start all 22 matches under Jones, each of them as captain, guided England to a fifth straight win against Australia on Saturday as late tries from Jonathan Joseph, Jonny May and Danny Care led to a 30-6 triumph – a record margin of victory against the Wallabies. England complete two years under Jones against Samoa on Saturday but the head coach already has one eye on the Six Nations next spring.
“We want a ‘three-peat’ there,” he said. “I don’t think any team have ever three-peated the Six Nations.”
While the Australian initially viewed Hartley as his “foundation captain” for his first 24 months in charge, he has given the hooker’s credentials a ringing endorsement – an approval which strengthens his claims to continue in the role through to the 2019 World Cup. “Dylan was outstanding,” added Jones, who in May stated that there was “no reason [Hartley] can’t carry on to 2019” provided he is “improving as a player and as a captain”.
“His captaincy was first-class. He’s moving from being a good captain to being a better captain. He manages the referee well, manages the team well. He’s got a good demeanour about him with the referee. It’s so important for the captain to have a good relationship with the referee. The ability to communicate effectively with the referee is so important and he does that brilliantly.
“He’s seen the bottom of the trough and he’s now surfing at the top of the crest and he appreciates relationships. He appreciates the opportunity of what he’s doing at the moment and he’s only going to grow as captain.”
Jones was tight-lipped over whether he will make changes against Samoa but he will hope to have Mike Brown available again after the full-back missed out against Australia due to a head injury. Brown was due to return to contact training when an unchanged 35-man squad reconvenes in Bagshot, but Sam Underhill suffered a head injury against the Wallabies, so must undergo the return-to-play protocols this week. As a result Sam Simmonds comes into contention for a first start, along with Danny Care, who scored one try and set up two off the bench against Australia.
“Danny came on at the right time, saw space behind and executed brilliantly,” Jones told BBC Radio 5 live’s Sportsweek programme. “He was like a little [Alexis] Sànchez playing for Arsenal, here there and everywhere looking for opportunities. He was very creative.”
Despite Jones’s praise for Hartley, Samoa, who lost 17-13 to Romania on Saturday, would also seem the ideal opportunity to hand Jamie George a first start but it remains to be seen how many of England’s players who toured with the British & Irish Lions over the summer feature, with Jones reiterating his concern over their fitness.
“These Lions players still aren’t fit and that’s the battle I’ve got,” he added. “They were better [on Saturday] and they will be better next week if they play. We’ve got to get more work into them. It’s been tough for them. They came back from a six-week series where they played 300% more than they normally play in their post-season, then they had 10 or 11 days of pre-season at their clubs then they were playing eight or nine games on the trot. It’s tough for them but we have to try to get them ready for Test rugby.
Jones also said he will monitor the progress of the New Zealand-born flanker Brad Shields when he joins Wasps next season. Shields’s move from the Hurricanes was confirmed on Sunday and he will be eligible for England as soon as he arrives, qualifying through his parents. “If he comes over and he starts playing, then I’ll have a look at him,” said Jones, before the move was confirmed.
Meanwhile the Rugby Football Union is not expected to investigate an incident between the Australia head coach, Michael Cheika, and a supporter at Twickenham. TV cameras picked up an exchange between the two and after the match Cheika said: “There are plenty of fans giving me a gob full, I can assure you. And [it’s] not nice, not pleasant. But that is the way it goes. I know when I walk down the stairs that I’m going to cop abuse but that’s the way she rolls.”The RFU confirmed to the Guardian that it has not received any official complaints however, and the governing body is only likely to investigate if it does so.


Was it a one-off opportunity missed or the shape of things to come? Among the questions swirling in the Murrayfield air on Saturday evening, amid more than a few exclamations of excitement and agony, this was one of the more poignant. If points were awarded for dominance and endeavour, Scotland would have been out of sight at half-time – but they are not, so they were not.
New Zealand, some way off their best, did what they had to for the win, turning on their brilliance in flashes, even as they were outshone by Scotland for much of this riveting Test match. Scottish dominance was manifested by no fewer than 17 visits to the All Blacks’ 22 but, again, no points are awarded for that alone. They did score two second-half tries, the second a beauty by Huw Jones, albeit with three minutes on the clock and a deficit of 12 points on the board, but New Zealand had by then taken three in the same period to keep a relentless Scotland, who kept swinging to the very end, at arm’s length.
If one were looking for evidence of the shape-of-things-to-come theory, the authority and confidence with which they wrought those positions felt far from the promising but unbelieving efforts they have been known by for much of the current century. This was a performance of some class.
“The players came with an ambition, an energy and aggression you have to have when you play New Zealand,” said Gregor Townsend, who so far is proving every bit as popular as his predecessor, Vern Cotter. “To have that all in a package was rare. Sometimes you come with aggression but you don’t have the accuracy; sometimes you have the accuracy but not the aggression. There were a lot of cool heads out there among the aggression and the more I’m thinking about it, the more gutted we all are that we didn’t get a win.”
Such anguish was to be found at every turn, which is an excellent sign, but that also plays into any suspicion that this was a rare chance, what one might call the if-not-now-when theory. Townsend knows that, if there is one classic characteristic of a team flattering to deceive, it is inconsistency - and it is an accusation this Scotland team are not above, to which memories of last season’s visit to Twickenham, after a fabulous home win over Wales, will attest. To flop next weekend against a highly motivated Australia would provoke anguish far more harrowing than losing here.
“We know Australia better than New Zealand,” said Townsend. “We’ve got to be better next week. I watched them [against England] and it was much closer than the score line suggests. They’ll be hurting from that and also the defeat against us in the summer. So we’ve got arguably an even bigger challenge next week.”
If they want encouragement, though, to believe that this performance dovetails with a broader dynamic whereby New Zealand are being chased down by a healthy pack of improving sides, of which they are representative, it came from none other than Steve Hansen. “Everyone back home was telling us that they were getting bored of us being dominant,” he said. “Well, they’ll just have to go away and have a cup of tea and think about that. Rugby’s in a good place. The people who understand the game will know that Scotland played particularly well. They’ll know that they’ve beaten Australia this year, and I think that’s their first loss at home in five games [actually six]. They’re a team on the rise. World rugby has got some good teams, which is really exciting.”
It is a compelling theory, albeit undermined by recent score-lines like 57-0 (New Zealand in South Africa), 42-8 (New Zealand in Australia) and Scotland’s aforementioned 61-21 humiliation at Twickenham. Saturday suggests they have worked such glitches as the last out of their system. It does indeed make next weekend’s visit of Australia their most significant test yet.

The Scotland fly-half, Finn Russell, will leave Glasgow Warriors at the end of the season after being offered a bumper deal by another club. The news was announced on Sunday evening by the Pro14 club and Russell will depart after a five-year stint at Scotstoun.
“Glasgow Warriors can confirm that fly-half Finn Russell will leave the club at the end of the season,” the club said. “The 25-year-old’s performances for both club and country have attracted attention from a number of clubs across Europe and he has been offered a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.”


Against the expectations of the doubters two free-hitting, first-time finalists, each trusting his skills to breaking point, gave a remarkable season the denouement it deserved on a cold midwinter’s evening by the Thames. Grigor Dimitrov won but David Goffin did not leave a loser.
For extended passages of the deciding match of the 2017 ATP World Tour Finals they brought freshness and daring to a task that has historically been fulfilled by more illustrious rivals. After two and a half hours of often tense, high-grade tennis – the longest final since John McEnroe defeated Arthur Ashe at Madison Square Garden in 1978 – Dimitrov,Bulgaria’s first representative at this end-of-year event, prevailed 7-5, 4-6, 6-3.
It was his fourth title of the year, adding $2,549,000 to the $3m he had already gathered from 44 match wins, and 1,500 ranking points to lift him three places to No3 in the world. At last the results and the performance have matched the glamour. If Dimitrov can sustain his run in Melbourne in January the Bulgarian and his trainer, Dani Vallverdu, for so long at Andy Murray’s side – can expect a season of much fruitfulness.
A tearful Goffin - who represents Belgium against France in the Davis Cup final later this week - said afterwards: “It was a special week for me, a lot of emotions, a lot of fatigue. It was tough. It was not easy to come back after losing to Grigor in the group. Congratulations to Grigor for a fantastic year.”
Dimitrov reciprocated, adding, “It’s such an honour to play here. This has been one of the best weeks I’ve ever had. Unbelievable effort by David and I wish him the best in the Davis Cup.”
Some thought the departure of Roger Federer (beaten on Saturday by Goffin), Rafael Nadal (defeated by Goffin four days previously), and the absence of Andy Murray (beaten by his unreliable hip) along with the Tour’s other walking wounded had ripped the heart out of this tournament, an event in its ninth year at the venue, with three more to come, under the new sponsorship of Nitto.
However, there have been six sell-out sessions of 17,800, including the final, and 13 of 15 matches drew more than 16,000. The lowest attendance was 15,193 on Tuesday afternoon for the match between Jack Sock and Marin Cilic, but the tournament total of 253,642 – just ahead of last year, if short of the 2012 record of 263,229 – the year London went Olympics crazy. There are tournament directors around the world in all sorts of sports who would die happy persuading more than a quarter of a million fans to watch their product.The start was riddled with nerves on both sides of the net, neither player able to hold serve until the 19th minute as they tentatively explored all the safe options before opening their shoulders.
Consecutive aces by Goffin secured the first hold of the match and there was a restlessness in the capacity crowd, who were waiting for caviar and were having to make do with fish fingers. The menu was about to change.
Both men were going for their shots, and Dimitrov broke to level in the eighth game as the level of the exchanges grew in quality and length, although Goffin’s overcooked forehand betrayed lingering uncertainty under pressure. At last the arena was warming to the contest and the combatants responded.
Goffin, the first Belgian since doubles specialist Dick Norman in 2010 to reach this tournament, was getting in and out of trouble like a frog in a hot tub. He quivered again with ball in hand in the 12th game, but it took Dimitrov five set points to crack his resolve and take the frame in just under an hour, forcing a sixth unforced error from him on the backhand.
Just as Dimitrov looked to be pulling away, Goffin broke for a third time in the second set. A rare double net-cord off his deep backhand that dribbled over, and a ridiculously brilliant half-volley off his toes in the 10th game helped Dimitrov to keep the set alive. There was little he could do, though, to stop the Belgian holding to love and level the match at one set each.
It took Dimitrov 11 minutes to hold at the start of the third – about the same time it took him to seal the first – so there was no lack of commitment under fire. Goffin’s serve was the difference between then – he had lost only five first serves in nearly two hours, a crushing 87 per cent – so Dimitrov had to find his crumbs elsewhere, and he did in the sixth game when he pushed Goffin deep and watched his backhand drift wide for the break.
In the penultimate game Dimitrov lobbed then passed Goffin, who saved three match points, held then turned to the crowd to conduct them in their roar of support. Dimitrov sweated heavily as he set about serving out for the biggest win of his career, grateful for two tired groundstrokes by Goffin. Handed his fifth match point, he saw a forehand inch long. And how grateful he was when Goffin dumped a simple backhand into the net. The crowd gave both of them an ovation every bit as loud as if Federer had won another title here.

Days after claiming credit for ensuring that three UCLA college basketball players were released after being arrested for shoplifting in China, Donald Trump tweeted that “I should have left them in jail!”
The US president lashed out at LaVar Ball, the father of one of the arrested players, for questioning how instrumental the president was in resolving the incident.
Asked on ESPN Friday about Trump’s role in getting his son and two other players home, Ball said, “Who?”
“What was he over there for? Don’t tell me nothing. Everybody wants to make it seem like he helped me out,” Ball said.
In response to an American father being “unaccepting of what I did for his son”, Trump tweeted that he should have left the three college students in jail in China.
Trump had previously tweeted that he wondered if the three players would thank him, saying that they “were headed for 10 years in jail!”
Now that the three basketball players are out of China and saved from years in jail, LaVar Ball, the father of LiAngelo, is unaccepting of what I did for his son and that shoplifting is no big deal. I should have left them in jail!
Although the three players, LiAngelo Ball, Cody Riley and Jalen Hill, were detained and questioned by police, they were never actually put in jail. Upon returning to the US, they were suspended indefinitely from the UCLA team. At a press conference this week, the players apologized and thanked the president.
“A lot of people like to say a lot of things that they thought happened over there,” Ball had said on ESPN Friday. He defended his son, saying, “I’ve seen a lot worse things happen than a guy taking some glasses. My son has built up enough character that one bad decision doesn’t define him.”
Ball is known for promoting his children’s careers: his eldest son, Lonzo, was drafted No2 overall by the LA Lakers this year. Rather than sign a multimillion-dollar contract with Nike, Adidas or Under Armour, LaVar released Lonzo’s signature shoe through his Big Baller Brand, with the sneakers retailing at up to $495.
Trump’s social media director, Dan Scavino, attacked Ball for those remarks on Saturday, tweeting on his personal account, “if it weren’t for President @realDonaldTrump, his son would be in China for a long, long, long time!”
The president’s Twitter feed followed with a tweet criticizing Ball early on Sunday afternoon. Trump has previously used his Twitter account to attack black athletes who protested about police brutality against black Americans by kneeling during the national anthem.
Last month, Trump used his official account to attack ESPN’s Jemele Hill, a prominent black sports commenter who has called the president a “bigot” and “a white supremacist”.
“With Jemele Hill at the mike, it is no wonder ESPN ratings have ‘tanked,’ in fact, tanked so badly it is the talk of the industry!” the president tweeted.
The White House press secretary had previously called on Hill to be fired for her criticism of the president.


It hardly seems possible but Faugheen is clear at the top of the betting for the Champion Hurdle following a remarkable and convincing return to action in Ireland on Sunday. Having his first race since January last year, a gap of 665 days, he made all the running and bolted up in Punchestown’s Morgiana Hurdle, the ninth Grade One success of his career.
After a saga of injuries including a damaged suspensory ligament, a bruised foot and a stress fracture to an unspecified bone, it seemed too much to hope for another of the dominant displays we saw at the Festival here in 2014 and 2015. But those who sent him off at odds of 4-11 were given little cause for concern as he bounded home 16 lengths ahead of Jezki.
His followers may be biting their nails again on Monday morning, however, as they wait to hear how Faugheen has taken this 14th outing of his career. For any ageing animal with his veterinary history, being sound in wind and limb on the day after a race cannot be taken for granted, a point that Willie Mullins readily acknowledged in the winner’s enclosure.
“Hopefully he’ll be all right in the morning,” was the trainer’s response when asked about targets. “He’s been very good at home and we haven’t had any setbacks with him. Hopefully we won’t after today. Hopefully he’s fine in the morning and over the next few days and we’ll just prepare him for his next run.”
Having been a general 6-1 for the Champion Hurdle on Sunday morning, Faugheen is now no bigger than 5-2 to do what no horse has ever done – win the title back after a two-year gap. By the time the race comes round in March he will be 10, older than every winner since Sea Pigeon in 1981.
The opposition on Sunday was hardly fearsome and sterner tests lie ahead. But Mullins argued there was some substance to this performance. “He didn’t win by just hanging on. He was having his first run of the year against three horses that are super-fit from running. He just jumped out and took the race from them. The race was set up for any one of those, fit from summer racing.”
Paul Townend was the lucky man who got to do the steering, following Saturday’s injury to Ruby Walsh, who had been Faugheen’s only jockey since December 2013. The full extent of Walsh’s injury may not be established until he has follow-up x-rays later this week but Dr Adrian McGoldrick, the Irish Turf Club’s chief medical officer, said he has “no doubt” Walsh will be back in time for the Festival.
That seems a brave prediction, in view of Professional Jockeys Association guidelines that it takes an average 130 days to recover from a tibia fracture.
When Walsh broke two bones in the same leg in early November 2010, he was out of action until a fortnight before the following Festival.
It was a better day for his weighing room colleague Bryan Cooper, who enjoyed an easy success in the Shloer Chase here aboard Fox Norton and can now look forward to partnering the same horse in the Tingle Creek three weeks from now.
This was just a third success from 34 rides in Britain since Cooper landed a job with the late Alan Potts, leading to doubts about his confidence, but this ready success may quieten the doubters for a while.
“I’m chuffed for him because he’s been under pressure, there’s no two ways about it,” said the winning trainer, Colin Tizzard. “Alan decided he was going to ride all the horses in England and I went along with it. If I’d had my choice, it might not have been. But he has come out on Friday, riding Finian’s Oscar, gave him a lovely ride.
“And he was brilliant on this horse today. No one could have rode him any better. And I hope we can fill him up with confidence because he is a good jockey and we can put that out of our minds now. There’s no reason why he can’t ride everything.”

If David Moyes had any illusions that keeping West Ham in the Premier League will not be among the biggest challenges of his career, then the manner of this defeat must surely act as a major wake-up call.
Aside from a 10-minute spell either side of half-time in his 500th Premier League match as a manager Moyes saw his new side totally outplayed by a Watford team brimming with confidence and instilled with a clear game plan by their manager, Marco Silva.
With his former club Everton keen on luring the man who has taken only three months to transform the fortunes of a side that lacked identity last season under Walter Mazzarri, the Scot will know he needs to turn things round just as quickly to ensure his latest assignment does not go the way of his other three posts since leaving Goodison Park to succeed Sir Alex Ferguson at Manchester United in 2013. Well-taken goals from Will Hughes – his first in the Premier League on his full home debut – and Richarlison did the damage here, although in truth Watford had Heurelho Gomes to thank for keeping the scores level after two stunning saves from the goalkeeper just before the break.
“I thought the better team won the game,” admitted Moyes. “We need things to go our way to build some confidence because it’s tough for the players, I can sense that. But I didn’t enjoy the performance today.”
The Scot had promised to waste no time attempting to plug his new side’s leaky defence having already conceded 23 goals this season under Slaven Bilic, with Winston Reid retained despite returning to London only on Friday after New Zealand’s World Cup play-off defeat by Peru in Lima. Marko Arnautovic – a club record signing in the summer at £24m – was singled out by Moyes before the match as one of the players who under-performed for Bilic and intentions were immediately laid bare as the left-back Aaron Cresswell received the ball from the kick-off and hit a long ball in the general direction of the Austrian.
By contrast Watford have enjoyed an excellent start under Silva but three successive defeats since the victory over Arsenal here last month have dampened expectations slightly. The Portuguese steadfastly refused to discuss the prospect of joining Everton this week and handed the Dutchman Marvin Zeegelaar his debut at left wing-back, with Hughes making only his third Premier League appearance since joining from Derby for a cut-price £8m in the summer.
The attacking midfielder was impressive for England at the European Under-21 Championship in the summer but has had to bide his time under Silva so far since then. Yet the manner in which the 22-year-old swooped to convert Watford’s opener in the 11th minute after Andre Gray’s mis-hit effort fell straight to his feet suggested this is a player who can thrive at this level given an opportunity.
Floating inside from his starting position on the right, Hughes was at the heart of most of his team’s best movements during a first half in which West Ham appeared content just to stay in the match. A delightful flick on the half-hour mark almost set up Gray but the striker could not quite find his feet to apply the finish. After criticism arising from the statistic that West Ham’s players had covered less ground than any other team, his side were putting in the effort but found themselves second best in every department.
Yet Watford were grateful Gomes was still paying attention five minutes before half-time when a rare moment of enterprise on the edge of the box from Andy Carroll and Mark Noble played in Cheikhou Kouyaté, only for the Brazilian to pull off a brilliant one-on-one save. Gomes did even better to keep out two Arnautovic efforts from point-blank range in injury-time, leaving Moyes with his head in his hands in disbelief in the dugout.
Had it not been for Kouyaté’s wastefulness, West Ham would have drawn level six minutes after the restart following great work from Arnautovic down the right, only for the Senegal midfielder to blaze his effort over. That was to be as close as they got to achieving parity. With the impressive Abdoulaye Doucouré running the game, Watford were also likely to create chances and a fantastic save from Joe Hart to claw away Adrian Mariappa’s header kept his side in it. But the England goalkeeper could do nothing to prevent Richarlison doubling Watford’s lead, with protestations that Hughes had handled the ball before supplying the pass falling on deaf ears.
Moyes’s response was immediately to withdraw Carroll for Diafra Sakho – the outgoing striker met with a chorus of boos from the away end. “You’re not fit to wear the shirt,” they chanted. Even the announcement of eight minutes of injury time in which to salvage a point did not go down well with West Ham’s supporters, who seemed more concerned about venting their frustration at the situation they now find themselves in.
Moyes’s appeal for unity could yet have the desired effect, although it is hard to escape the feeling that things may get worse for him before they get better.


England will finish the year on a winning note unless Samoa, vanquished by Romania in Bucharest on Saturday, produce the result of the decade. Unbeaten in their first year under Eddie Jones, they have lost only against Ireland in 2017 without, Scotland at home apart, producing an entirely compelling performance. Jones will not mind, counting down as he is to the 2019 World Cup; he is completing a jigsaw puzzle, adding pieces each game. Against Argentina, England were largely on the front foot, building patiently, if unspectacularly, almost rigid in their approach. On Saturday, they played more off the back foot, absorbing pressure and feeding off mistakes. Performances should be looked at collectively rather than in isolation: in the past two weeks England have shown defensive resilience and opportunism in attack, buoyed against Australia by the return of Maro Itoje, a multi-faceted player whose decision‑making is invariably spot-on. He had been on the field only a few seconds when he spotted a run by Kurtley Beale and hauled down the full‑back before he had got into his stride. For all their strength in depth they have no one to match him.
Australia were left to reflect on a performance which they were unfortunate to be behind in after 71 minutes but ended in a record defeat against England. Their head coach, Michael Cheika, had said before the game the Wallabies had developed a “no excuses” culture but after his team had fallen on the wrong side of every review by the television match official, he questioned the workings of a system that all too often adds ambiguity rather than clarity. If the yellow card shown to Beale for a deliberate knock-on seemed harsh, given that he had a try-scoring opportunity, and should have been reviewed, the three tries that were adjudicated resulted in the correct application of the law. In the case of Michael Hooper’s non-try, it is debatable whether the spirit of the law was satisfied. Originally in an offside position when Tevita Kuridrani kicked ahead, he held back and was behind Marika Koroibete when the wing played the ball with his shin. He had to be within an imaginary 10-metre line, but that was not part of the review, merely where he had been when Kuridrani kicked ahead.
A year after Ireland defeated New Zealand for the first time, Scotland were within one pass of emulating them. When Stuart Hogg realised Beauden Barrett was going to prevent him from reaching the line in the dying minutes, he tried to pass over his right shoulder but, making his decision too late, the ball went forward and the All Blacks, who had been outplayed for long periods of the match, held on. In years past New Zealand have tended to pack the team at Murrayfield with reserve players but, in homage to the home side’s revival, they were close to full strength and won because they finished most of the opportunities they created. It proved the difference as Scotland, for all their ambition and ability to last the course, too often faltered at the moment of reckoning. They can, though, take much from defeat, forcing the leading team in the world to dig deep and deeper.

South Africa held on to win the battle of the former heavyweights in Paris, but a few hours after Eddie Jones had pounced on a questioner who had asked whether England had been lucky that all the reviews at Twickenham went their way, what turned out to be the decisive score for the Springboks came after a forward pass from Eben Etzebeth to Jesse Kriel. It was judged on review to have been legitimate because the ball had been dislodged from the second row’s hands, an act that nine times out of 10 results in the ball being deemed to have gone forward. Not that South Africa care after the 38-3 defeat in Dublin the previous week but this was a match between two teams stripped of self-belief, powerhouses of the game who have lost their might. At the end of a week in which France won the right to host the 2023 World Cup, Guy Novès lost the 13th of his 20 matches in charge of the national side. Japan in a new stadium in Nanterre at the weekend is far from a foregone conclusion.
Fiji were within a penalty of drawing in Ireland and Georgia, denied contested scrums at the end, were a converted try away from a tie in Wales. Fiji recovered from 17-3 down to pull back to 20-20 before being sunk by a late penalty and Georgia were 10 points down in Cardiff after 20 minutes. Ireland and Wales were both below strength, which says something about their narrow victories. The match in Cardiff ended with uncontested scrums after the Wales tighthead prop Tomas Francis was sent to the sin-bin and the player he had replaced, Leon Brown, was deemed unfit to return to the field. Georgia were on the attack and had to go for a lineout after a penalty rather than their preferred option of a scrum. Wales said there had been no gamesmanship, but that was not their stance at the end of the Six Nations when they accused France of pulling a front-row stunt at the end of the game, a claim that was reviewed by the tournament organisers who ruled that the evidence was inconclusive. Wales face Georgia in the 2019 World Cup. Will World Rugby have put a deterrent sanction in place by then?


Two days before Australia’s nil-nil draw in Honduras, Brisbane Roar announced the signing of Ivan Franjic. It is news that has understandably received little attention, but now the Socceroos have confirmed their place at the 2018 World Cup, Franjic can expect plenty of scrutiny as attention shifts to candidates auditioning for one of the 23 places in the national team squad set for Russia.
The impact of qualification on the short-term prosperity of football in Australia cannot be understated. Beyond the obvious public relations boost and the direct and indirect financial benefits, there should be a flow-on effect to the A-League. Awareness will hopefully be raised about the local competition, its contribution to the representative side and the role it plays refining the selection of the eventual World Cup squad. The competition could do with a fillip following a lacklustre opening seven rounds reflected in poor TV ratings and uninspiring crowd figures.
Excitement around the World Cup will hopefully have a galvanising effect as Roar fans barrack for Franjic’s seat on the plane to Russia, Mariners supporters state the case for Daniel De Silva, Victory’s for Rhys Williams, and so on. The competitive tension this creates – within the confines of a shared goal – offers a win-win: an increase in incentives not only to engage with the A-League but get behind a team, all while organically building anticipation for the World Cup.
From an A-League perspective, one of the most pleasing aspects of Australia’s triumph over Honduras was the emphasis given to the competition for incubating the latest batch of national heroes. Mile Jedinak was the obvious figurehead, the goalscoring skipper one of four former Central Coast Mariners in the starting XI. Of those to take the pitch on Wednesday night, 13 of the 14 were A-League veterans, Bailey Wright the sole exception.
The association between the national team and the local league is demonstrable. Over the coming months it needs to be made abundantly clear to the groundswell of Australians who will take an interest in the World Cup, but may lack enthusiasm for the A-League.
Typically, Australians are unable to rush headlong into a frenzy of World Cup excitement. The next fortnight will be preoccupied by two significant but uncomfortable stories; FFA’s AGM on 30 November to determine how the game will be governed in this country, and the future of Ange Postecoglou. The implications of this are concerning, and cannot be overstated: less than a month after reaching the men’s World Cup for only the fifth time in Australia’s history, there could be no national team manager, nor a board in place to replace him.
The retention of Postecoglou should be a priority for whomever is in charge. He has achieved everything he has been tasked with, from using the 2014 World Cup as a springboard, to winning the 2015 Asian Cup, and now sending a group of players that is very much his to Russia. Not only that, but he has done so with a strategic vision to send them there as contenders, not as makeweights. Some unsatisfying media relations in recent months should not cloud our judgment.
Postecoglou’s retention also establishes the playing field for contenders. Everybody knows how the coach wants to play, his preferred formation, and the tweaks that turn Plan A into Plan B. We know positions that could benefit from bolstering. We know the improvement required of the challengers to force their way into his reckoning. Starting from scratch ahead of a June deadline seems unnecessarily self-flagellatory, even by the standards of Australian football.
Players, in concert with their clubs and the national set-up, should be given the best run possible to force their way into World Cup contention. It is one of those tacit assumptions of the A-League’s purpose that would benefit from enshrining in the aftermath of the governance debate – especially if one outcome is an independent competition. It seems to stand to reason the football community – professional league among it – should have as one of its shared ambitions the prosperity of the national team. Occasionally this may conflict with the short-term needs of top flight clubs, but hopefully, within a spirit of collaboration, mutually beneficial outcomes can be figured out.
One high profile case study has emerged in recent days, that of Tim Cahill and Melbourne City. Cahill is in the awkward position of representing a totemic figure for his country but finding himself only a fringe player for his club side. It is in Australia’s interests for Cahill to play regularly in the lead up to Russia, but it may not be in City’s. A January transfer is looking increasingly likely.
Other examples may be more nuanced. For example, Dimitri Petratos’ chances of forcing his way into the squad are significantly enhanced playing as a No10 at Newcastle Jets rather than as a right-winger, a role Postecoglou doesn’t employ in his existing strategy. With the Jets able to recruit an injury replacement for Ronald Vargas, they may look for a central playmaker during the next transfer window, but in so doing they may well hamper the international prospects of one of the form Australian players in this year’s competition.
Franjic’s situation is more cut and dried. He already has 20 caps for his country and his value is proven at the biggest tournaments. He won silverware under Postecoglou during his first stint at Brisbane Roar, he has experience of Russian conditions and boasts the attributes of a prototypical wingback, a vital component of the current Socceroos strategy. He just needs to prove his form and fitness after suffering a succession of debilitating injuries.
Franjic, and every other Australian in the A-League, has 20 home-and-away fixtures remaining to state his case. The A-League has 20 home-and-away fixtures remaining to capitalise.


A 60-year-old former solicitor from Bristol has been buried at sea after being swept overboard in the Southern Ocean during the Clipper round-the-world yacht race.
Simon Speirs was a crew member on the yacht Great Britain, which was in sixth place in the leg between South Africa and Australia. The incident occurred on day 18 of the third race of the 13-stage competition.
Speirs, who had more than 40 years’ experience as a dinghy sailor, was helping to change sails on the foredeck of the 21-metre (70ft) yacht when he was washed overboard in gale-force winds.
Despite being clipped on with a safety tether, he became separated from the yacht, race organisers said.
The crew got Speirs back on board within 36 minutes and CPR was administered by three medically trained crew, including a GP.
“However, Simon sadly never regained consciousness and was pronounced deceased,” organisers said in a statement. “The cause of death is unconfirmed at this time but thought to be by drowning.
“At the time of the incident, Simon was clipped on, wearing his lifejacket, which included an AIS beacon, as well as approved waterproof ocean oilskins.”
A spokesperson for the Marine Accident Investigation Branch (MAIB) said it was investigating the death and would meet the yacht in Fremantle, Western Australia.
The race co-founder Sir Robin Knox-Johnston said a new type of tether was being used in the race but that something had “gone wrong”.
“Whether it is a type failure or a one-off failure – we won’t know that until it has been examined,” he said.
Competitors have been told to use both clips on their tethers as an extra precaution in the meantime.
Speirs was given a sea burial in a Christian service led by the yacht’s skipper and which was followed at home by his family.
“Our deepest thoughts are with his family and all those who knew him,” race organisers said.
Racing has taken a back seat over the past 24 hours for the Clipper Race fleet following the tragedy on board CV30 yesterday. We want to thank everyone who has sent messages of condolence and support for Simon’s family, friends, crew and the fleet https://t.co/GIdNSK47xc
Speirs had been crewing Great Britain since the race began in the UK on 20 August. The yacht is currently about 1,500 miles off Fremantle.
The incident follows the deaths of two crew members in the 2015-16 Clipper race.
Sarah Young, 40, from London, was swept into the Pacific Ocean by a wave as she tended to the mainsail in high winds aboard IchorCoal on 1 April 2016. She had not been tethered and was recovered from the sea after spending about an hour in the water. She could not be resuscitated and was also buried at sea, a race spokeswoman said.
In the same race the preceding September, IchorCoal crew member Andrew Ashman, 49, from Kent, died after being knocked unconscious while off the coast of Portugal.
A MAIB report into the two deaths in April 2017 recommended that the race organiser, Clipper Ventures, change its procedures so that skippers “ensure safe working practices are maintained continuously on board”.
It also recommended that Clipper Ventures develop measures to reduce the risks of crew falling overboard “to as low as reasonably practicable”.
Steven Clinch, the chief inspector of marine accidents, said earlier this year that Clipper Ventures had done much to address the safety issues raised in the report.
Ashman’s death was the first in the 20-year history of the 20,000-mile race, which competitors pay almost £50,000 to take part in. Each yacht has a professional skipper, and although crew members do not have to be qualified sailors they must undergo a training programme.


For all that is positive about Tottenham, for all that they are about to move into an exciting new stadium and are blessed with a crop of highly promising young players, their away record against big sides has become an issue. It’s a problem that predates Mauricio Pochettino – Spurs have now won just four of their last 87 away games against Manchester United, Arsenal and Liverpool – but one that he seems a long way from resolving: although this was his first league defeat to Arsenal, he has now won just one of 18 away games against other top-six sides.
There were mitigating factors here – the fact that neither Harry Kane nor Mousa Dembélé looked fully fit and that Harry Winks wasn’t able to start, plus marginal refereeing calls on both Arsenal goals – but there always are. Pochettino, as he had to, mounted a defence, pointing out that other top-six sides also have problems in away games against the elite, but this was a game settled in the final half hour of the first half as Arsenal produced one of the displays of ferocity and discipline of which they are infrequently capable and which they have recently reserved for big games in the FA Cup. When they can press as well as this, you wonder why they don’t do it all the time.
Once they had gone 2-0 down, Tottenham were forced on the offensive and could easily have leaked more on the counter as the pace of Alexis Sánchez and Alexandre Lacazette was unleashed. And for all Pochettino claimed his side had been on top until they were undone by the referee Mike Dean, that was not how it seemed. The focus on refereeing decisions often ignores the fact that they, just as much as defensive errors, are often the result of pressure.
Tottenham’s problems could be traced to the back of midfield, where the pairing of Dembélé and Moussa Sissoko offered muscularity but not control. They were an oddly immobile pairing, both of body and mind, clearly rattled by the pressure they found themselves under. Again and again in the first half, Arsenal players found themselves with time to measure passes through the Spurs defence, leading to the Héctor Bellerín cross that Lacazette just failed to touch in and then the second goal.
It’s hardly a secret that Sissoko is a player who tends not to relish the rough and tumble of a derby. This was the first game he had started for Tottenham against Arsenal, but in 14 previous starts in derbies, seven for Newcastle against Sunderland and seven for Toulouse against Bordeaux, he had a record of won one, drawn one, lost 12.
Here he contributed to Tottenham seeming oddly short in an area in which Arsenal are often fallible, in central areas just in front of the back-line. Statistics don’t really explain the issue which is largely positional, but Sissoko won the ball back only once in the game, whether by tackle or interception, – very low for a holding midfielder whose side were under such pressure.
The introduction of Winks just after the hour made a significant improvement: he imposed himself far more than either of the other holding players, to the extent that he had 48 touches in his 29 minutes in the pitch, as opposed to Dembélé’s 63 in 61 and Sissoko’s 67 in the whole game.
That lack of a platform – and perhaps Kane’s lack of effectiveness – had a knock-on effect further up the pitch. Dele Alli, who had also missed the England friendlies with injury, may not have been at his sharpest, but he was a largely peripheral figure anyway until being booked for a late lunge on Granit Xhaka. Neither he nor Christian Eriksen were able to muster a passing accuracy above 72%. The lop-sided triangle in midfield, whether in a 4-2-3-1-cum-4-3-3 or a 3-4-2-1-cum-3-5-2, has been one of Spurs’ great strengths; here, against all expectation, it failed to function.
Perhaps it is just a learning experience. Perhaps a young side feeling its way to the next level will always have setbacks like this. The prognosis for Tottenham remains generally positive. But, as Arsenal could tell them, sooner or later there’s a need for potential to be transformed into something concrete otherwise it withers away.
In this game, perhaps, Pochettino was right. Perhaps Tottenham were largely unfortunate, both with decisions and issues of fitness. But the wider pattern is clear: Spurs’s away record against top-six sides is dismal and until it improves the frustration will endure. Already any thought of a serious league challenge this season has all but gone. Their three remaining league games against other members of the big six, the next of them at Manchester City in a month, will reveal a lot about how sustainable their progress really is.


Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Ronald Darby has issued a statement defending Jameis Winston against an accusation of groping.
On Friday, the NFL confirmed it is investigating an allegation that the 23-year-old quarterback of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, grabbed a female Uber driver’s crotch last year in Arizona. The Uber driver, identified by Buzzfeed News only as Kate, said Winston “behaved poorly” from the start of the ride, including shouting homophobic slurs at pedestrians, before grabbing her crotch. She also said Winston was seated in the front seat of the vehicle as the lone passenger.
However, Darby released a statement on Sunday saying he was in the car with Winston at the time and he did not see any assault. “I felt the need to come forward and clarify some inaccurate accounts of the evening of 13 March 13 2016 when myself, a friend and Jameis Winston took an Uber ride in Arizona,” said Darby in the statement. “There were three of us in the car, not just one as has been reported. Myself and Jameis were in the backseat. I am confident that nothing inappropriate in nature happened in the car that evening and Jameis did not have any physical contact with the Uber driver. The accusations are just not true.”
On Friday, Winston said the “accusation is false”. Kate did not report the incident to the authorities but did report it to Uber the following day, according to the BuzzFeed account, and the passenger, now identified as Winston, was banned from the ride-hailing company for his behavior.
Later on Sunday, Kate’s attorney John Clune said Darby should give his phone to the NFL. “We have asked the NFL this morning to investigate Mr Darby and are demanding that he immediately turn his phone over to the NFL so the GPS history can be forensically examined,” said Clune.
Clune also defended his client’s story of events. “To be clear, no one else was in the car besides Mr Winston and if anyone is ‘confused,’ it isn’t the Uber driver. Mr Winston’s friend from his [his college] days is just making things worse by inserting himself into this.”
Darby has defended Winston before. The quarterback was the subject of a high-profile sexual assault complaint by another student during his time at Florida State. Winston was never charged over the 2012 incident, and Darby provided an affidavit saying that he had seen the quarterback having consensual sexual relations with the complainant.
Winston settled a lawsuit with the woman in December “to the satisfaction of the parties”. In January 2016, FSU agreed to pay $950,000 to settle the Title IX lawsuit filed by the woman against the university.
Winston, who this month became the second-youngest player in league history to eclipse 10,000 career passing yards, was tipped as a dark-horse Most Valuable Player candidate entering his third professional season, but has struggled with his efficiency and has been sidelines with a shoulder injury as the Buccaneers have slumped to a 3-6 record, good for last place in the NFC South.


The phoney war is close to concluding and thankfully the Ashes are almost here, with both squads in Brisbane. England are weary after a tough day in the field at Townsville on Saturday, being bullied by cricketers they knew little of a fortnight ago, while the Australia coach, Darren Lehmann, spent Sunday responding to criticism – from fans and former players – of the squad he helped to select. Curiously Australia are favourites but England, with only the fourth seamer’s spot unresolved, look more settled.
Shane Warne described Australia’s selection as “confused” and backed England, while his old leg-spinning rival Stuart MacGill branded the selectors “morons masquerading as mentors”.
“Everyone is entitled to their opinion, aren’t they?” Lehmann said. “I would just like all our ex-players to be really positive about the Australian cricket team. That would be the way to go. I’m looking forward to everyone getting behind Australia in the contest that is about to unfold.”
The major questions about their squad regard Tim Paine, the 32-year-old wicketkeeper-batsman who has not scored a century for 11 years, the selection of Shaun Marsh and disposal of Matt Renshaw, and who will bowl the overs that will allow Mitchell Starc and Pat Cummins to be at their most effective. Lehmann hopes the captain, Steve Smith, once picked primarily for his seldom seen leg-spin, of course, bowls more.
“He’ll have to bowl at some stage, I’m sure,” he said. “England are a quality side, he’s got key wickets against them before. We didn’t play an all-rounder last year for a while so we are comfortable with the three fast bowlers and [Nathan] Lyon. We’ve got a good squad to pick from. We’re confident we can get 20 wickets with that.”
Lehmann says he has seen enough of England in the tour matches (he watched them live on the third day in Adelaide) to exploit weaknesses in Brisbane. “We’ve seen a couple of things we like. Certainly we will be targeting some players.”
Ben Stokes, the phoney war’s preoccupied protagonist, will not leave the agenda. Jonny Bairstow batted away questions about whether the all-rounder would be joining the squad soon (England’s players appear to know as little as the average punter). They are yet to learn if Stokes has been charged but he will have to go through an England and Wales Cricket Board disciplinary hearing regardless, which will determine when he will next play.
“It would be amazing if Stokesy comes out,” Bairstow said. “He’s a fantastic cricketer. We don’t know what’s going on at the moment; it’s completely out of our hands. Hopefully it’s resolved sooner rather than later because we want the best cricketers playing in the Ashes. That’s the series we want. We don’t want people not playing and the standard going down because of that. Whether Ben comes over or not, the 11 guys who take the field at the Gabba on Thursday will be very motivated.”
While England have spent the tour preparing as if they will be without Stokes, Australia, says Lehmann, are preparing as if they will face him at some stage. “You’re always planning for every player, even though he’s not in the squad,” Lehmann said. “We’ll just wait and see what happens with ECB and the courts.”


Chris Coleman has been confirmed as the new Sunderland manager. The 47-year-old has signed a two-and-a-half year deal to become Simon Grayson’s successor in what is a major boost for Sunderland and a huge blow for the Football Association of Wales, which had hoped to persuade Coleman to sign a new contract.
The FAW held a board meeting on Friday to discuss his position, with both parties previously involved in lengthy talks about extending the deal that was due to expire at the end of this month, but Coleman has decided the time is right to return to club management and has agreed to take the plunge with Sunderland.
His appointment is something of a coup for the club, who are bottom of the Championship and staring at the prospect of back-to-back relegations. Coleman will be in the dugout for the first time on Tuesday night, when Sunderland travel to Aston Villa. The 2-2 draw with Millwall on Saturday gives the club an unwanted English record of 20 consecutive home games without a win
“Sunderland AFC are delighted to announce Chris Coleman as the club’s new manager,” read a club statement. “The Welshman has signed a two-and-a-half-year deal at the Stadium of Light and arrives on the back of six memorable years as Wales boss, during which time he managed his country into the top 10 of FIFA’s world rankings and an incredible run to the semi-finals of Euro 2016.
“The 47-year-old was highly sought-after but chose Sunderland as the fifth club of his managerial career, following spells with Fulham, Real Sociedad, Coventry and AEL.”
Michael O’Neill, the Northern Ireland manager, Paul Heckingbottom, who is in charge at Barnsley, and Ally McCoist were among the other candidates considered for the Sunderland post but Coleman emerged as the clear frontrunner. O’Neill was given permission on Friday to speak to the Scottish FA over their current managerial vacancy.
Coleman’s decision to take over at the Stadium of Light would appear to be something of a gamble on his part given Sunderland’s problems over the past few seasons but it is a club with huge potential and Coleman has the personality to make an instant impact. Coleman’s decision to leave international football will come as a massive disappointment to the Wales players, who made their feelings known as to how desperate they were for him to continue in the job after his spectacular success.
Appointed as the late Gary Speed’s successor in January 2012, Coleman will go down as the most successful manager in his country’s history after leading Wales to the European Championship semi-finals last year. During his last game in charge, against Panama on Tuesday, the Wales supporters repeatedly urged him to stay on. The FAW chief executive, Jonathan Ford, said: “The FAW and Wales as a nation will be eternally grateful for the job he has done over the last six years as national team manager, from travelling the length and breadth of Wales outside of the media spotlight to talk to players and supporters, to guiding us to the semi-finals of the European Championships.
“We wish Chris the very best of luck for the future as he returns to club management, a desire for which he has always been honest and open about.”


It’s a long time, 2,159 minutes. Exactly enough to fit in Beverly Hills Cop and all four Indiana Jones movies, plus the Godfather, Toy Story, Man With No Name and the original Star Wars trilogies. Those of a more masochistic bent could spend it watching all the senior football Saido Berahino has played since he last scored a goal: 2,159 minutes and counting. By the time Stoke City take on Brighton in the Premier League on Monday night, 632 days will have passed since he celebrated one of his own. As statistics go it is shocking and must be a source of great concern for his employers. How many more movie marathons must we sit through before it is fair to label him another wasted talent with a great future behind him?
In an interview with the Daily Telegraph in early 2015, Berahino complained that “people read about me and hear about me but nobody really knows who I am”. At the time he was best known as a raw but promising 21-year-old striker with West Bromwich Albion, but the interview sketched a picture of a more complex character, offering different aspects of light and shade. A refugee forced to flee Burundi for England alone as a 10-year-old, Berahino eventually joined his mother and sisters who had also escaped the civil war that claimed the life of his father. He came across as an apparently well-adjusted young man who clearly adored his mum and had a good understanding of the suffering those left behind in his homeland were forced to endure. Heck, he was even trying to help by setting up an eponymous foundation which he hoped would eventually raise enough money to build a hospital.
Which is not to say that butter wouldn’t melt in the mouth of a footballer who at that stage in life had represented his adopted country at every level from under-16 to under-21 and already featured in one senior England squad. Boys will be boys and he had encountered some pot-holes along the road. Photos emerged of him inhaling nitrous oxide, then, more seriously, he pleaded guilty to drink-driving after failing a breath test when he was caught speeding in his car. Berahino cited his religious faith as a crutch on which to lean during these difficult times off the field as he approached the end of his first and only 20-goal season. Here was a kid at a crossroads, but with God and goals on his side it seemed the world was his oyster.
So, 2,159 minutes. But at least his most recent goal was decisive. Still a West Brom player at the time, Berahino scored what proved to be the clincher in a 3-2 win over Crystal Palace on 27 February 2016. It had been three months since his previous one, but in the aftermath of that victory his then manager, Tony Pulis, spoke fondly of the striker and declared him the Baggies’ answer to Jamie Vardy or Harry Kane. It was a bold call and ultimately a foolish one. The Leicester City striker and his Tottenham Hotspur counterpart are England regulars who have scored 104 goals between them since Berahino last found the net. By contrast, the 24-year-old has just one top-flight assist and a missed penalty to his name. It constitutes extremely slim pickings for a player who holds himself in regard high enough to merit throwing a hissy-fit when a move from The Hawthorns to Tottenham fell through on transfer deadline day in 2015. On Twitter he announced he would never play for the club again as long as chairman Jeremy Peace remained in charge.
Berahino never did get his move to Spurs, who could be forgiven for thinking they probably dodged a bullet. After 21 appearances he has yet to score for Stoke City, for whom he signed last January for £12m. On wages of £70,000 per week with a contract that runs until June 2022, his is an expensive goal drought with which to saddle any club and it shows no sign of ending. “After a frustrating period he’s now desperately keen to reignite his career and we look forward to seeing him do that with us,” said Stoke’s chief executive, Tony Scholes, when Berahino signed his deal. Ten months, no goals and not much else later, his current thoughts on the matter are worth at least a penny.
Upon signing for Stoke, Berahino was forced to deny he had been too big for West Brom in every sense of the word. It emerged he had served an eight-week ban for testing positive for an unspecified recreational drug and rumours circulated about weight problems. He had previously admitted to “feeling depressed and struggling for focus” after a long spell on the sidelines. Despite his pleas for forgiveness at what was an obviously difficult time, the club cut him loose at the first opportunity and their fans were happy to see the back of a player they felt thought West Brom was beneath him.
While Berahino could be excused a slow start to his Stoke City career following his personal and fitness problems towards the latter stages of his time at the Hawthorns, his increasingly fleeting cameos suggest that Mark Hughes is losing patience with a striker whose scoring touch has completely deserted him. He has come on in the 86th, 78th and 80th minutes in Stoke’s three most recent Premier League games and while the England squad he was once part of prepared for their friendly against Germany, he suffered the indignity of playing all 90 minutes of a Checkatrade Trophy defeat for Stoke Under-23s against Bury at Gigg Lane in which he drew yet another blank.
“We have high hopes for Saido to be that striker who gets that 15, 20 goals, which makes a huge difference,” said Hughes towards the end of last season. In the interim, those minutes on the pitch have kept adding up and he has failed to get even one. He has, however, got engaged to his girlfriend and his Twitter feed shows no signs that he is plumbing the depths of despair he experienced at West Brom. We know he has overcome far worse traumas so he is clearly not a player beyond hope. Nevertheless, for all his regular talk about people not really knowing who he is, after 2,159 minutes without scoring, one can’t help but wonder if the striker even knows himself very well any more.


The most spectacular year of Tommy Fleetwood’s life has been afforded an appropriate ending. For Fleetwood, the Harry Vardon trophy in recognition of winning the Race to Dubai, the European Tour’s order of merit.
On a day of multiple reward in Dubai, Jon Rahm, another who has revelled in a wonderful 2017, secured the DP World Tour Championship. The element of surprise, which impacted on both winners, was the late collapse from a hitherto nerveless Justin Rose. The Englishman’s back nine of 38 on Sunday meant a share of third place and the handing of the Race to Dubai to Fleetwood by 58,821 points.
In proving just how fine the margins were, had Rose been just a single stroke better off, his tie for second would have been sufficient to deny Fleetwood the greatest achievement of his career. Rose inevitably will look back towards a missed par putt from close range at the 16th on Sunday and before that a slack drive at the 12th.
Fleetwood therefore collects a Race to Dubai bonus of £944,000. His share of 21st here after a fourth round of 74 was barely relevant. Rose’s wobble conceded the main prize. And yet, displaying off-course class, Rose was amongst the first to embrace Fleetwood as he stepped from the 18th green.
“It’s tough to come up just one shot short,” Rose said. “But congratulations to Tommy. He’s been leading for most of the year and he’s battled really hard these past few weeks. He deserved to finish it off.”
This success comes only 18 months after the Southport golfer was at such a low ebb with his game he did not want to compete. Here, Fleetwood celebrated with his fiancée and two-month-old son.
“Wentworth 2016 has always been the benchmark,” Fleetwood explained. “I turned up on the Thursday morning and I genuinely wanted to pull out because I didn’t think I could get it off the 1st tee. I was embarrassed how I was hitting it. I was scared of what I was going to do.
“My ultimate goal in life is to be the best player in the world. That will always be the same. Whether I achieve it or not is another thing but I’ll always strive for that.”
Rahm, who will also be a valuable addition to the European Ryder Cup team in France next year, was the tour’s rookie of the year even before this victory. He was not of a mind to understate a third professional win, all achieved within 11 months.
“When you accomplish something in life, it’s always a great feeling,” the 23‑year‑old Spaniard said. “When you do something that you had in mind but wasn’t a goal for the end of the year, you accomplished something that was years down the road, is just such an incredible feeling.
“It’s like when you have an errands list and you finish two hours early, it’s a very similar feeling. It’s very, very special.
“I don’t know if it shows anybody else or not, but it does prove to myself that I belong to be here. I belong on the European Tour and I belong on the PGA Tour.”
The Spaniard signed off with a 67 to win by one shot, at 19 under par. Shane Lowry and Kiradech Aphibarnrat of Thailand shared second, with the former perhaps the more worthy of praise having produced an outstanding 63 on Sunday.
Sergio García, Dean Burmester and Dylan Frittelli ended up alongside Rose at 17 under. The day was to belong to Fleetwood and Rahm; a dynamic duo who continue to prove European golf is in safe hands.


Enemy No1 Besart Berisha came back to haunt Perth Glory yet again as Melbourne Victory notched their first win of the season with a 2-0 triumph in Sunday’s clash at nib Stadium.
Victory entered the match in the unthinkable position of last on the table after managing just four draws and two losses from the opening six A-League rounds. With the scoreline reading 0-0 approaching the hour mark, another winless week beckoned for Victory. But goals to Berisha and Leroy George broke the game wide open, with the win catapulting Victory into sixth spot on the table.
Berisha, who scored a controversial penalty against Perth while playing for Brisbane in their 2012 grand final win, was the subject of derogatory songs among the Glory supporter area known as ‘The Shed’. But Berisha had the last laugh in front of the 13,565 crowd, tapping home from close range in the 56th minute after a failed clearance attempt from Glory defender Alex Grant.
When a diving George thrust out his right boot to score in the 67th minute, Victory had the three points in the bag.
Perth, who suffered a 5-2 loss to Wellington last round, slip to seventh spot on goal difference. Glory’s injury crisis, which had claimed the likes of Adam Taggart (hamstring), Diego Castro (calf), Scott Neville (groin), and Andreu (calf) over the past fortnight, meant their playing stocks were thin; so much so that coach Kenny Lowe decided to hand a starting debut to Jacob Italiano, who at 16 years and 112 days became the youngest Glory debutant since a 15-year-old Danny De Silva appeared in 2013.
Victory had the best two chances of the opening half. Berisha came within centimetres of opening the scoring with a glancing header in the 27th minute, only for it to bounce off the upright and into the arms of goalkeeper Liam Reddy. A short time later, Reddy pulled off a fingertip save to deny a powerful header from Victory defender Rhys Williams, who departed Glory in bitter circumstances at the end of last season. Glory’s only real chance of the half fell to Italiano, who sent his shot just wide of the target after the ball made it to him at the far post.
Victory also produced the best chances of the second half, and Berisha and George were able to capitalise on some poor Glory defending.
Earlier, Sam Kerr showed she is primed for another stellar showing for the Matildas this week, after her double lifted Perth Glory to a 3-1 win over Melbourne Victory in the W-League.
Kerr netted twice in the second half past an exposed Victory goalkeeper Casey Dumont as the Glory earned a come-from-behind win to remain equal top alongside Brisbane Roar. She showed no ill-effects after missing the Glory’s last match with a minor quad strain, displaying her trademark turn of pace on numerous occasions.
Natasha Dowie had opened the scoring early in the second half for the visiting Melbourne side, but Glory equalised almost immediately through Rachel Hill.
Kerr, who this week was short-listed for Asia’s Women’s Player of the Year, will headline the in-form Matildas against China in Melbourne and Geelong over the coming week. “I felt good out there, I got through it and we won, which is the main thing,” said Kerr, who only played the first 70 minutes after an agreement with national team medical staff.
“Victory took it to us and we started poorly, but we came out strongly in the second half and deserved the win in the end. Next week will be a good test [for the Matildas] against a good team to see where we are at ahead of next year’s Asian Cup.”
Canberra United also secured a comeback win after Newcastle Jets had claimed an early lead on home soil via Emily van Egmond’s penalty. The Jets could have extended their lead when Cortnee Vine struck the crossbar, however United revived in the second period and earned all three points thanks to goals from Ash Sykes and Toni Pressley.
Sydney FC belatedly claimed their first win of the season in thrilling fashion on Saturday with Remy Siemsen scoring an injury-time winner against champions Melbourne City. It had been a tough start for new Sky Blues coach Ante Juric but his side defied expectations to twice come from behind for a 3-2 victory. The result continues an erratic start for the all-star City who sit mid-table with two wins from four outings.
The round commenced on Friday with Brisbane Roar knocking over Adelaide United thanks to a lone strike from Matildas’ winger Hayley Raso in the dying minutes.


One sunny morning last November, Ben Hooper, a 38-year-old former policeman, waded into the Atlantic Ocean from a beach in Dakar, Senegal, and plunged right in. In film of the moment, Hooper appears thick set, almost podgy. He’d spent the past year bulking up and now layers of fat concealed muscle beneath. He wore a sports watch, black goggles provided by a sponsor and a pair of tight blue shorts. The sun had risen early, and by 10.33am, when Hooper entered the water, the ocean temperature had reached 30C, a lukewarm bath. A group of reporters gawked from the shallows. Most of them squinted in the bright light.
Hooper had been in Dakar for six weeks, preparing to swim to Natal, northeast Brazil, 1,879 miles away. If successful, he would become the first person to swim across the Atlantic Ocean – 12 miles a day for over 140 days straight – an unfathomable feat. As he swam away from the beach, Hooper began to feel tears in his eyes. A mile later he “cried like a baby”. The launch represented the culmination of three years’ planning, and the relief was overwhelming. Later that day, as the adrenaline wore off and the magnitude of the task began to sink in, he swam against currents that made it difficult to achieve significant mileage. Later, while he recovered on the support boat, a 37-year-old catamaran, he wrote the first in a series of blog posts he’d publish during the attempt. “Spent the night drifting under sea anchor,” it read, “4.5 miles closer to making history.”
A fierce wind drove across the water and at times the swell rose so high Hooper lost sight of his boat
Hooper’s posts were being uploaded to Facebook, and very quickly became difficult to read. On day two, Hooper’s crew lost contact with a second support boat, whose captain had returned to Dakar, refusing to continue with the expedition. A couple of days later, Hooper again faced unusually strong currents, limiting his mileage. Soon, clouds stretched across the vast horizon, sometimes bringing rain, and the ocean became dark and choppy. Hooper began to spend more and more time on the boat, waiting for moments of calm. By day seven he was down on his targets. Fatigue mounted. Low moments became commonplace. “Think of swimming in a washing machine on a heavily soiled cycle,” he wrote of ocean conditions in one post. “I am being thrown around all over the place.”
On Facebook, in part to sustain crew morale, Hooper appeared bright and positive, especially after sessions in which he was able to chalk up substantial distance. But his body was under attack. Small jellyfish stings were regular and sapped energy. While swimming through seaweed, lice nipped at his torso. When the ocean was choppy, waves battered his back, arms and legs, pushing him under, exacerbating exhaustion. In poor conditions, Hooper was in danger of injuring himself getting on and off the boat, and every now and then he would take a hit from a kayak that glided alongside him for support. During the morning session of day 17, he was sick, twice. On day 18, he began to complain of neuralgia.
Hooper had chosen a November launch date for favourable conditions, but the weather turned against him. Now a fierce wind drove across the water and at times the swell rose so high Hooper lost sight of his boat.
On day 21, Hooper swam blindly into the half-eaten remains of a Portuguese-man-of-war, a jellyfish whose venom paralyses its victims. Hooper began to writhe in pain, unaware of the cause. When he was retrieved from the water, the crew discovered stings up and down the right side of his body. A section of tentacle was still attached to his shoulder and had to be removed. Every now and then his eyes would roll into the back of his head and, as his speech began to slur and his blood pressure plummeted, he struggled to remain conscious. Hooper later told me that, at one point, he was “on my way out”, and that the ship’s medic, Pamela Mackie, “brought me back” to life. For hours, Hooper remained in significant danger. Pain coursed through his body like an electric current. For support, Mackie reached a British trauma surgeon by satellite, who told her that renal failure was an acute possibility. If his kidney packed up, Hooper would not survive.
Hooper spent the next four days on the boat, recuperating. On day 26, he re-entered the water and swam two miles, still sore from the attack. Three days later, in stormy seas, a steering cable snapped and required repair. The storm built. Waves rose to 30ft, crashing around the crew like ironic applause. Now clouds covered the sky and everything appeared eerie. The rain poured. The wind grew in speed and force. The catamaran, perhaps betraying its age, creaked and groaned.
Finally, on 15 December, Hooper put out a press release, announcing the expedition’s end. Overnight, a storm had reared up, and damage to the boat had been deemed “severe enough to warrant a reappraisal” of the attempt. Further damage, the boat’s captain, Nigel Taylor-Schofield told me, would have “compromised my ability to get him out of the water”, which might have been fatal. Whereas Hooper’s blog posts could be playful, here his tone was defiant. “We have NOT failed,” he wrote. “We have achieved and gained the knowledge to succeed in the future.” Later, in a separate message, Hooper added: “I have never doubted my ability to swim across an ocean. My family have never doubted me. I believe this incredible challenge to be possible.” He’d spent 33 days at sea. Of the expedition’s scheduled 1,879 miles, he had swum 86 – 4.5% of the journey – and lost 2st. He signed off, curiously upbeat: “Christmas is coming, I’m no longer fat. I’m on my way to Natal with my Santa hat.”
One day in May, I met Hooper in Cirencester, near his Gloucestershire home. We sat on a park bench discussing the details of his attempt – what went well, what didn’t. Hooper had returned to the UK in March and now he appeared deep in a state of reflection. One question bugged him: should he plan a new attempt?
I wanted to push myself, to see how far I could go. Because a lot of things I’ve tried in life haven’t worked out
Hooper made the decision to swim the Atlantic in the winter of 2013. For a year he developed the foundations of an expedition, often spending “hours and hours and hours” alone online, searching for relevant information. He worked out that strong east-to-west trade winds would create favourable crossing conditions over the winter period, and that the water at that time of year would be warm and inviting. He also saw that Dakar to Natal would represent the shortest crossing, but that the route would be shared by migrating sharks. He began to amass a long list of other potential dangers, including hypothermia, hyperthermia, exposure, mass calorie deficit, the great white shark, the oceanic whitecap shark, the Portuguese-man-of-war and another jellyfish, the Atlantic sea nettle.
Still, Hooper persevered. For three years he didn’t work, concentrating instead on being “a full-time athlete” and running the expedition. (He relied heavily on donations to survive.) By 2015 he felt physically ready. He had swum “12 million metres” in training, he told me, mostly in a local pool but sometimes in ocean conditions in Florida and the Mediterranean. With investor funds he bought a boat. Later he purchased supplies and a communications system. Tentatively, he lined up a crew. In August 2016, the catamaran sailed to Dakar, ready for launch. Hooper followed a month later.
When we met, I asked him why he decided to swim across the Atlantic, and why he might try again. He answered that, in completing such a monumental feat, he could “inspire others”, including his eight-year-old daughter, Georgie, and raise money for charity. But, later in our conversation, a more complicated motivation emerged. In 2006, a car crash that brought to a halt his police career sparked a period of depression, and in 2013, following a series of personal setbacks that would result in an affair and the breakdown of a long-term relationship, the illness returned. Suddenly, his “personal life was a mess”. He was finding it difficult to sleep. Eating became an effort. “I wasn’t happy,” he said. “I felt like I was failing in every angle of my life.”
Recognising the decline, Hooper sought an activity through which he could renew his focus and, recalling an early childhood ambition to swim across an ocean, he landed on the idea of a transatlantic expedition. “Not to say that there was ego at play would be a lie,” he said. “I wanted to push myself, see how far I could go. Am I capable of achieving more and not killing myself? Because a lot of things I’ve tried in life haven’t worked out… I saw it as an opportunity to try and redeem myself.”
Transatlantic swimming has a colourful history. In 1995 a 42-year-old Frenchman, Guy Delage, washed up on a beach in Barbados, claiming to be the first person to have done the crossing. Delage had spent 55 days at sea and covered 2,335 miles. At one point, reported the New York Times, he had given a shark a “sharp kick in the nose” before dashing to the safety of his raft. Later, perhaps feigning modesty, he told a reporter at the French paper Libération that “I did nothing superhuman or extraordinary,” before saying he would never swim again. Three years later, another French-born swimmer, Benoît Lecomte, swam from Hyannis in the US to Quiberon in France, covering 3,716 miles in 73 days. He, too, was tracked by a shark – this time for five days – and he too declared himself the first person to cross the Atlantic.
Both swims were celebrated around the world. But after each attempt, questions began to surface about their credibility. In the aftermath of the Delage swim, experts noted that the raft on to which the Frenchman clung must have been equipped with a kind of sail, thus making it impossible to know exactly how much of the trip was human-powered. Following the Lecomte swim, reporters noted that because he ate and slept onboard a support boat, which drifted with favourable currents overnight, it was equally difficult to work out exactly how much of the distance he had actually swum.
Will he try again? It will be difficult to raise the sponsorship – Hooper estimates he would need about £700,000
When an athlete claims to have accomplished something they haven’t, public reaction can turn nasty. Lecomte mostly escaped criticism. In making the crossing, he raised significant sums for charity. (He is now planning to swim across the Pacific.) But in Delage’s case, reaction turned sour. Before setting out for Barbados from the Cape Verde Islands, the swimmer had signed an exclusivity agreement with a TV channel, guaranteeing an important windfall. Delage, it turned out, was broke. His motivation had not been human achievement, as many people believed, but money, and when the information was revealed by the press he was roundly ridiculed. “You have to understand that when I left I was saddled with debts,” he told reporters. “I had no choice.”
While Hooper was out in the Atlantic, questions about the legitimacy of his attempt began to surface on a popular marathon swimming forum. Prior to Hooper’s swim, the sport had been rocked by a number of controversies, mostly fraudulent claims of completion, and the community had begun to ramp up efforts to lay bare any kind of scam. Hoping to satisfy potential naysayers, Hooper had promised total expedition transparency. But as the attempt wore on, onlookers began to bemoan the lack of hard data being shared with the public. Hooper’s blog posts were mostly trivial and contained few facts; he would post co-ordinates, but only on rare occasions, making it tricky for spectators to discern his whereabouts. The inconsistency of information raised eyebrows.
Before long, forum members began to investigate Hooper’s past, prompting further questions, mostly to do with training. As a rule, ocean swimmers cut their teeth crossing channels, but prior to the Atlantic effort Hooper had never swum a large body of water. Jennifer Figge, who has completed an Atlantic crossing (although she, too, has had her efforts questioned, not least by Hooper), swum “close to 20 different swims” before attempting an ocean crossing, she told me, including the Gibraltar Strait. But Hooper had foregone the challenge. When I asked him why he’d never completed a significant but shorter swim that might help establish integrity, such as crossing the English Channel, he said, “I’ve always steered away from the Channel… It’s cold. I don’t do cold water. And it’s dirty. End of.”
By the end of the expedition, most onlookers had come to a collective conclusion: the attempt had been recognised as valid – Hooper was not a fraud, as some had suggested – but it was also labelled incredibly naive. Hooper, no matter how well-intentioned, had somehow remained ignorant of the extent of the challenge, and he’d paid the price. In the words of Dan Simonelli, an open-water swimmer who had helped early on in the expedition and had once been signed on to become its official observer: “Ben really didn’t have the experience.”
One evening in June, I had another conversation with Hooper over the phone. I’d called to ask about his plans for a second attempt. In May, when Hooper had mentioned another expedition – “I don’t think I could live with someone else turning up and doing it” – he had been careful not to commit publicly to timings. He still hasn’t made any further announcements. “We’re very much at that very early stage,” he says now. “Just chewing it over.”
Hooper has a list of things he’d require to increase the probability of success. The items are mostly pragmatic: a bigger boat and a more effective communications package, among other things. But a new attempt would also demand a significant number of new sponsors, which are difficult to secure. When I asked Simonelli whether he thought Hooper could manage a second expedition, he said: “I think it would be hard for him logistically to muster the attempt again. That has nothing to do with the swim. But it will be difficult for him to get the sponsorship, the money.” Hooper puts an estimated figure at £700,000, double what he raised for his first expedition.
Partway through our conversation he told me he’d begun to train, but that training was secondary to other things going on in his life. He wanted to spend time with his daughter. He also wanted to secure meaningful employment. He’d previously described his personal financial situation as “dire” – he owes £75,000 to expedition investors alone. Finding regular work is essential, he told me, not just to repay debts, or to plan a second expedition, but to survive.
For the first time he seemed hesitant about a second expedition. “We’ve learned a hell of a lot,” he said. “That’s the thing we can shout about.” But the second attempt doesn’t seem to be his priority. “We’re all trying to work and restabilise our lives,” he said. “I’m obviously trying to dig myself out of a hole.” He paused, then said quietly, “And have a life.”


No offence intended, but I doubt I was alone, when José Mourinho took the job two summers ago, in wondering whether one of the more remarkable records in the business – the one that tells us a former youth-team player has been included in Manchester United’s match-day squad in every game since 1937 – would be one of the casualties.
Mourinho also seemed to sense it, judging by the way he came armed to his first press conference with a notebook featuring a list of names, colour-coded in red, blue and green, to nail “the lie” that he was somehow averse to bringing through players from academies.
Some list it was, too. Mourinho had scribbled 49 names into his notebook and was so determined to make his point he followed that up with an email where the number had gone up to 55. It was just a pity, perhaps, on closer inspection that he appeared to think Arjen Robben, Mikel John Obi, Lassana Diara, Marko Arnautovic, Raphaël Varane and Kurt Zouma were eligible – for no other reason, it seemed, than that they played for him when they were under the age of 21.
At the risk of being pedantic, Robben had made more than 100 appearances for Groningen and PSV Eindhoven, winning 10 caps for Holland and starring in Euro 2004, before Mourinho signed him for Chelsea. Carlos Alberto was also included despite playing 43 times for Fluminense and winning four Brazil caps before linking up with Mourinho at Porto. Mario Balotelli was also on the list, one of many who had made their debuts elsewhere, and when it came to the legitimate choices it turned out that 10 of the players Mourinho had cited had played fewer than 10 minutes on his watch. Only 11 of the original 49 had played 90 minutes or more and three – John Swift, Sam Hutchinson and Anthony Grant – had managed one minute each. How, Mourinho was asked, had people developed this unfair impression of him. “One lie, repeated many times,” he explained. Robert De Niro would have been proud of the acting from the top table.
It was a nice try – classic José – but perhaps those of us who doubted him might have to admit now that he is proving us wrong. Mourinho has been in the job for almost 18 months now and United’s record, stretching all the way back to Tom Manley and Jackie Wassall playing in a 1-0 defeat to Fulham in October 1937, is still intact.
Nobody else gets near and, judging by Mourinho’s comments in the last few days, that run is never going to be broken while he is in charge. “I feel it is a way to keep a certain identity of the club. To keep that identity means, basically, we should bring a new player from the academy every season. I don’t want to be the one that breaks that and I think the next United manager – it doesn’t matter when he comes – should also try not to break it.”
The manager who does, to quote one United executive, will probably be “run out of the city” and it is pleasing to hear Mourinho talk that way because, whatever your position might be when it comes to his football club, it is an incredible record to maintain.
It also made me wonder whether the people in charge at Old Trafford might ever be bold enough to formalise it as a part of the club’s statutes – “the United rule”, or something along those lines – to safeguard it in the future, too. True, perhaps it is not necessary if there is an unwritten rule that every manager should keep to the same anyway, but equally, why not make it official? It would be the first of its kind – and it would fit neatly with how United like to project themselves, as a club that nurture more young players than anywhere else.
On a similar theme, wouldn’t it be good if the Premier League might one day consider introducing a rule whereby every club did the same? Not every manager, perhaps, would embrace the idea and nobody wants a situation where a young substitute is on the bench purely for the sake of it, with absolutely zero chance of playing. But think about the good it would do, too, in these times when the biggest problem for some outstanding young talents is what is known as “the pathway” – the last part of the journey to make that jump from the various age levels into the first-team squad.
At the other Old Trafford, home of Lancashire County Cricket Club, I was at a dinner last week where Phil Foden of Manchester City was collecting a prize for being the rising star of 2017. Foden also brought the Golden Ball, the award he won as the outstanding player of the Under-17s World Cup, and to see him on stage was a reminder of his age. His tie wasn’t quite done right, he was wearing trainers with his suit and he had a request that brought an “aah” from his audience. “Can I thank my mum and dad?” he asked.
Nobody should expect him, at 17, to be a regular for a club with City’s ambitions. Not yet, anyway. But when a few of us had the chance to speak to Gareth Southgate after Brazil’s visit to Wembley the following night the England manager made the point that Foden’s biggest problem will be navigating a way past everyone else at City. Pep Guardiola already has David Silva, Leroy Sané, Raheem Sterling, Bernardo Silva, Ilkay Gündogan and Kevin De Bruyne to operate just behind Sergio Agüero and Gabriel Jesus. Next season Alexis Sánchez could be added to the mix, Patrick Roberts might be back from his loan at Celtic and Aleix García likewise from Girona. Foden might be supremely talented but, with that kind of competition, don’t just assume it is going to be a seamless rise.
Not just Foden, either. All the time we hear stories about talented youngsters being nurtured by the leading Premier League clubs only to be held back at the last juncture. Just look at the number of brilliant talents developed by Chelsea who tend to hit a jam when it comes to the first team. Could something be done to make that pathway a clearer route? How much of an appetite is there among the clubs to help the next generation? Or is this something that concerns Southgate, and those who care about the England team, more than it does the clubs themselves?
It is certainly worth floating if the clubs at the top of English football are serious about promoting their own. Everybody likes to see a talented young footballer come through the ranks but that process is difficult, to say the least, when those clubs have the money to buy in ready-made first-team players. It isn’t easy for the managers either, when they are under pressure for instant results, but Mourinho certainly sounded like he, for one, was happy to go this way.
The game against Newcastle United was number 3,887 on an 80-year run for Manchester United that started in the year of the first 999 call, the birth of Robert Charlton (Bobby, to his friends) and Neville Chamberlain becoming prime minister. The next best is Everton, who have done the same for 21 years, but the rest are a long way behind and it is not easy to know sometimes whether they particularly care.
After everything that came out during the Mark Sampson affair, how dismal that the Football Association was still incapable of offering a credible version of the truth when it came to the latest investigation about the England Women’s regime.
Unfortunately, while the FA’s chairman, Greg Clarke, promises to rebuild trust, the evidence suggests his organisation is still going in for the same kind of half‑truths and evasion judging by the statement announcing the resignation of Lee Kendall, the goalkeeping coach.
Kendall had admitted it was true, as alleged by Eni Aluko, that he used to speak to her, a player of Nigerian descent, with a fake Caribbean accent. The FA’s investigation lasted four weeks and concluded with a recommendation that he needed to go on a diversity course. Unlike Sampson, Kendall admitted that he had done what he was accused of.
That, however, was skilfully kept out of the statement in which the FA announced it had concluded no action was necessary. In fact, anyone reading that statement would have been entitled to think Kendall was completely exonerated and the allegations had been thrown out. “We wish him well for the future,” it concluded – and, yet again, like a conjuror waving a wand, the FA had presented a version of events that was wilfully designed to keep us from knowing the facts. It was afterwards the FA had to admit the truth was something completely different.
We should be used to it by now, I suppose, and it hardly comes as a surprise when, over time, it becomes apparent the FA uses more spin than Muttiah Muralitharan. Yet the latest mangling of the truth is particularly lamentable at a time when many of us might have hoped – more fool us – that the FA had learned a thing or two from the Sampson case. Clearly not.
“We have lost the trust of the public,” Clarke said in his speech to the FA council. Yes, and it will remain lost as long as the relevant people have the same relationship with the truth as Uri Geller used to have with his cutlery.
Chris Coleman’s reasons for choosing Sunderland might not automatically be clear when the club have become renowned as a managerial wasteland and a team that were relegated from the Premier League last season, finishing bottom, have been in freefall ever since.
Yet don’t underestimate the size of Sunderland, when the club had the seventh-highest gate in the top division last season and are still the joint sixth most successful team, level with Chelsea, when it comes to the number of league titles.
The problem is the last one was won in 1936, whereas the lack of thinking at the modern club can probably be summed up by the fact Jack Rodwell is earning £60,000 a week at the bottom of the Championship because when he signed his contract nobody thought it worthwhile to insert a relegation clause.
Rodwell – who has started one league game and recently played at centre-half in the Checkatrade Trophy – might yet become the best‑paid player in League One and, as long as Sunderland’s owner, Ellis Short, and the club’s other executives are capable of that kind of shortsighted thinking, it is going to be difficult for Coleman to flourish at a club where so many others have failed.


To say that Brisbane has not been a happy hunting ground for England cricketers is an understatement on a par with “Jacob Rees-Mogg would quite like to leave the EU”. England have not won there since the team with just three flaws – “can’t bat, can’t bowl, can’t field” – was victorious in 1986. Then the Gabba was a proper cricket ground. In the afternoon the smoke and smell of the barbecues on the boundary edge would add to the atmosphere in this outpost city. Now it is a stadium, a symmetrical bowl in which dismissed batsmen have to think hard about the whereabouts of their dressing room as they head disconsolately from the middle. However, it can still be an intimidating place to start a tour.
In 1986 England prevailed after Ian Botham had hit his last and 14th Test century, which allowed Mike Gatting some freedom when juggling a bowling attack that comprised two experienced spinners in John Emburey and Phil Edmonds, Graham Dilley, who would grab his first five wicket-haul there, Phil DeFreitas and Botham, who was still capable of bluffing wickets.
But in the 21st century especially, the Gabba has often fulfilled the worst nightmares of the most pessimistic of Englishmen. In 2002 there was not a cloud in the sky when Nasser Hussain invited the Australians to bat and Simon Jones’s tour ended after he ruptured his anterior cruciate ligament when sliding to field a ball on the boundary. Australia made 492 in their first innings and won by 384 runs. In 2006 Steve Harmison’s first delivery headed straight to his captain, Andrew Flintoff, at second slip. Australia declared on 602 for nine and won by 277 runs.
Even in 2010, at the start of England’s triumphant tour, it looked none too rosy after three days, when Andrew Strauss’s side had a first-innings deficit of 221. Then came the response of 517 for one declared, which ensured the draw and swung the pendulum. In 2013 the nightmares returned. Mitchell Johnson, with nine wickets in the match, put the wind up batsmen in a manner seldom seen since the heyday of West Indies. England lost by 381 runs. So there are reasons to be wary for visiting Poms as they get out of the team bus on Vulture Street, a road that often seems so aptly named. In 20 Ashes Tests in Brisbane Australia have won 11, England four.
What do we expect there aside from a traditional hostility to English cricket teams? There will surely be more bounce for the bowlers than was witnessed in Townsville last week. “Tennis ball bounce” is the usual description of Brisbane, which means it is not quite so steep or brisk as in Perth but with a hard ball the nicks should carry.
This winter the Australians will welcome as much pace in the pitches as possible, which usually makes for a more entertaining game. In recent Ashes series they have been frustrated by the sluggishness of the surfaces in England, occasionally by accident, more frequently by design. They would be even more disappointed to encounter slow pitches at home.
At the Gabba Pat Cummins may be the quickest bowler on view; if not that accolade may go to Mitchell Starc, who will seek to swing that new ball back into the right-handers. Both would welcome as much bounce as possible and, like prop forwards at the start of any rugby international, England will have to demonstrate that they are up for the tough physical contest up front before trying to play more expansively. Expect the Australian bowlers to propel more bouncers than England’s, who will aim to restrict and frustrate the batsmen as they did so successfully in 2010-11.
It would be a surprise – and a disappointment – if the mood in Brisbane is not one of gung-ho optimism among the Australians as the Test approaches. However, this is not entirely supported by their selections for the first Test. In the past Australia was no country for old men while England were renowned for lurching back to the comfort blanket of the old familiars, who would then be exposed to the vast expanses of the MCG and the subsequent barbs from Bay 13. That no longer applies.
Australia have dropped Matt Renshaw, the 21-year-old opener, who has played in their last 10 Tests, averaging a respectable 36. They have recalled Shaun Marsh, who is 34 (averaging 36 in the 23 Tests that he has played in the past six years). Marsh has played once against England, at Nottingham in 2015, when he contributed two runs. They could not decide whether to go for Matthew Wade or Peter Nevill behind the stumps. So they picked Tim Paine, 32, who played the last of his four Test matches in 2010. They have selected a debutant from Western Australia, Cameron Bancroft, who is only 24, a gutsy opening batsman of sound technique and, by modern standards, a bit of a blocker. These are cagey choices, though this does not necessarily mean they are bad ones.
England’s team for Brisbane is relatively simple to predict. The solitary debate concerns the fourth seamer; he will probably be Craig Overton, who has suddenly had an accelerated passage through the ranks as pace bowlers have become unavailable for a variety of reasons, despite Jake Ball’s rapid recovery. As if by magic Overton may well become England’s debutant, in which case he has a terrific opportunity on the horizon.
England do not often introduce debutants at the start of an Ashes series in Australia. A team of diligent researchers at the Guardian and Observer has come up with a list of England cricketers who made their debut in Brisbane. They are Tommy Mitchell in 1933, Colin Cowdrey and Keith Andrew in 1954, AC Smith in 1962, Brian Luckhurst and Ken Shuttleworth in 1970, DeFreitas and Jack Richards in 1986. Have you noticed something? Look at the dates and what do you see? England won the Ashes on four of those tours (they drew the series in 1962-63, which meant that Australia retained the Ashes).
Some optimism is required at this stage of an Ashes tour and over the last month this has not always been easy to find. So clearly we should celebrate Overton’s likely debut. Maybe there is some virtue in plumping for a novice, untainted by previous torments. Of the debutant bowlers above, all prospered in their first Test, with DeFreitas taking five wickets in the match and hitting 40 runs in his first innings; Shuttleworth took five for 47 in Australia’s second innings and there were three cheap wickets for Mitchell, a leg-spinner.
Of course, that list of English debutants on successful tours may just be a coincidence. But what if it isn’t? Then you will be setting those alarm clocks ever earlier over the next seven weeks.


On a weekend of shocks and surprises in the Rugby League World Cup, England would ultimately not fall foul of another in Melbourne – winning 36-6 against a Papua New Guinea side who were earmarked as a major threat. That in itself is a major positive.
Four games into the tournament though, and you suspect England are still capable of more: and how they will need it next week when they face Tonga in the World Cup semi-final. It is perhaps easy to focus on the negatives, primarily England’s lacklustre completion rate, but there were positives against PNG and if Bennett’s team get it right against Tonga, a first World Cup final in 22 years is within reach.
Papua New Guinea spent the group stages scoring tries at will but, in what will undisputedly be the biggest positive for Bennett, England’s defensive efforts were excellent, allowing their opponents only one try. By the time Garry Lo had scored it on the hour mark, England’s place in the last four was long since assured.
But whether it is the World Cup, Super League or a runaround in the Yorkshire Men’s League, a completion rate hovering around 50% is simply not good enough. This was, as Bennett succinctly put it in his press conference, the good, the bad and the ugly from England.
There is a fair argument to be had that, as long as England are winning knockout games, perhaps it matters little how well they are playing. But next weekend, the opposition will significantly improve – and England cannot afford to be so careless anymore.
This was a performance which had all the hallmarks of England’s group campaign. There was more than enough to get the job done – and on the occasions England clicked, they were very good. But there were simply too many mistakes and Bennett would have been forgiven for tearing out the precious little hair he has on his head because, if they are so indifferent next week, England’s tournament could be over.
To their credit, Papua New Guinea’s cause was not helped by the loss of their captan, David Mead, inside the opening two minutes. He was involved in an eye-watering collision with Luke Gale and the departure of one of their most experienced players clearly impacted PNG. They had only conceded 12 points in their three group games but by half-time, England had more than doubled that tally.
As has been the case for so much of this World Cup, England’s greatest success came down their right side and Jermaine McGillvary scored his fifth and sixth tries of the tournament there early in the match following good work from Kallum Watkins and Kevin Brown.
There was a third try for England as half-time approached, again the pressure telling on the PNG defence, this time allowing Alex Walmsley to reach over. However, more errors with ball in hand prevented that 14-0 lead from being extended further, and there was an underlying sense of frustration that England were not further ahead by half-time.
Brown did not return after half-time, but the introduction of James Roby from the bench once again gave England added zip around the ruck. He looks England’s strongest hooker over Josh Hodgson, but Bennett seems intent on introducing the St Helens pivot from the bench.
Roby’s introduction did not prevent England’s error count from rising, but there were encouraging moments of promise in attack. Gareth Widdop’s incisive kick for Ben Currie to touch down was certainly one of them, before two tries from Watkins – both created by McGillvary – were sandwiched between PNG’s only moment of joy as the Castleford winger, Lo, scored.
There was also still time for another try, this time from Ryan Hall, his 34th for England in as many Tests. It has been another fascinating weekend; Lebanon almost eliminated Tonga, New Zealand actually did go out – so the fact England are still in contention is, for them, the most important point of all. However, things are about to get a whole lot more interesting next week in Auckland.

There was a hint that the Barnsley Express was on the verge of a derailment on Friday in Sydney, smashed for 33 runs in three overs after collecting a first ball duck. So often when veterans pass their best, the decline is abrupt. Age gets all fast bowlers in the end.
But Katherine Brunt was having none of that, getting back on track in the best possible way by steering England with bat and ball to a 40-run victory in the second Women’s Ashes T20.
The 32-year-old clobbered a no-nonsense, unbeaten 32 in 24 balls to drive England’s innings to 152 for six, twice clearing the long-on rope with mighty strikes. Then in defence of that score, she was instrumental in orchestrating a collapse of five-for-20 that rocked the hosts after they had gotten off to a flyer.
Helped by Sarah Taylor’s rapid and precise gloves, Brunt had Elyse Villani stumped with her fourth ball before getting a bit of luck as Ellyse Perry dragged a pull shot onto the stumps via her boot. But it was the tightness of the spell that earned the errors, conceding just ten runs across four probing overs.
Until Australia lost their first wicket they were cruising, Alyssa Healy leading the way through a power play period worth 47 runs. But just as that opening stand looked to be getting out of hand for the visitors with four boundaries in a row, Friday’s hero Beth Mooney was run out with a direct hit from Jenny Gunn at mid-off.
When she went to the bowling crease herself, it took Gunn three balls to seduce Healy with her lack of pace, caught on 24 when trying to clear her favoured long-on. By the time Perry departed, it made four wickets in 16 balls with Australia’s wheels now falling off.
Rachael Haynes and Delissa Kimmince showed their experience to restore some local hope, but both were picked up by teenage spinner Sophie Ecclestone in the 14th over, the former picking out Heather Knight at cover and then the latter bowled trying to smash Australia back into the contest.
Hard-hitting all-rounder Ashleigh Gardner was also caught in the deep off the bowling of Danielle Hazell. Sure enough, Brunt was again in the game taking the chance on the midwicket rope.
“We had one day to turn it around and so we’ve done really well to pick ourselves up,” the Yorkshire champion said after play to BBC radio. “It was really bitter the other day. We’re still feeling it and it still hurts.”
Doing what they could to hang on as the required run rate climbed into double-digits, Australia’s lower order kept swinging, but the wickets kept falling – the hosts eventually bowled out in 18 overs. Gunn was the beneficiary, her three late wickets making very handy figures of four-for-13. It was the perfect way to cap her 250th appearance in an England shirt.
Earlier, the foundation was laid by Dani Wyatt who smacked a quick 19 after being elevated to the top of the order. Sarah Taylor continued where the opener left off, stroking a faultless 30 full of her customary timing and innovation before attempting an ambitious quick single that left her short due to a Kimmince direct hit from gully.
Natalie Sciver top-scored, riding shotgun with Taylor then Brunt for 40 in 32 balls, taking no risks until she gave a catch to Haynes at cover with three overs to go. By then it mattered little – England were well on their way to a serious total.
Megan Schutt’s efforts at either end of the innings were again of the highest quality, picking up the dangerous Wyatt, then going on to concede only four runs in the vital 20th over. Her two-for-16 makes 18 wickets across the three formats for the South Australian in this series.
The home captain Haynes acknowledged it was poor effort after having successfully retained the Women’s Ashes trophy on Friday night. “We’re playing a game for our country so I’d be pretty disappointed if anyone in the change rooms found it difficult to play today,” she said. “We have a lot to prove in this format. We haven’t won a T20 series since 2015.”
England now has the chance to return home with at least the T20 mini-series to their names if they win again on Tuesday, that game also to be played in the nation’s capital.


Gabby Douglas has apologized for saying that women should “dress modestly and be classy” to avoid enticing “the wrong crowd”, a comment that drew criticism for victim shaming and kicked off a public rift between members of last year’s US Olympic women’s gymnastic team.
Douglas, a three-time Olympic gold medalist, said she was “deeply sorry” for a tweet in response to Aly Raisman, the US team captain at the London and Rio Games where both won team golds in addition to individual medals.
“i didn’t correctly word my reply & i am deeply sorry for coming off like i don’t stand alongside my teammates,” the 21-year-old Douglas tweeted.
i didn’t correctly word my reply & i am deeply sorry for coming off like i don’t stand alongside my teammates. regardless of what you wear, abuse under any circumstance is never acceptable. i am WITH you. #metoo
Raisman, who last week confirmed she was sexually abused by longtime USA Gymnastics doctor Lawrence G Nassar, had posted a message about the victim shaming weathered by women who come forward with stories of sexual assault.
“Just because a woman does a sexy photoshoot or wears a sexy outfit does not give a man the right to shame her or not believe her when she comes forward about sexual abuse,” the 23-year-old Raisman wrote. “What is wrong with some of you? AND when a woman dresses sexy it does not give a man the right to sexually abuse her EVER.”
The six-time Olympic medalist continued: “Women are allowed to feel sexy and comfortable in their own skin, in fact I encourage you all to wear what you feel good in. I will not put up with any woman or girl being shamed for wanting to wear a skirt, dress, etc. I do not tolerate it. Are we clear? Oh and one more thing. STOP VICTIM SHAMING. It is because of you that so many survivors live in fear.”
That’s when Douglas responded in a since-deleted tweet: “however it is our responsibility as women to dress modestly and be classy. Dressing in a provocative/sexual way entices the wrong crowd.”
The remark prompted widespread backlash on social media including from Simone Biles, who won team gold alongside Douglas at last year’s Rio Games.
“shocks me that I’m seeing this but it doesn’t surprise me…,” Biles, 20, wrote to Douglas, attaching a screen shot of the deleted tweet. “honestly seeing this brings me to tears bc as your teammate I expected more from you & to support her. I support you Aly & all the other women out there! STAY STRONG.”

Douglas and Biles are the only two American all-around champions to win multiple gold medals in a single Olympics.


Roger Federer leaves his magnificent season one match earlier than he had anticipated but it is a measure of the heights he reached in 2017 that he was not crushed by losing to David Goffin here on Saturday. The Swiss missed out on a meeting in Sunday’s final of the ATP World Tour finals with his long-time doppelganger, Grigor Dimitrov, who in the evening session beat the rising young American Jack Sock by the eccentric margin of 4-6, 6-0, 6-3.
Goffin, who had taken just two sets off Federer in six previous meetings, earlier beat Federer 2-6, 6-3, 6-4 in an hour and 45 minutes, becoming the first player in eight years to prevail against the two top-ranked players in the world at this tournament. Nikolay Davydenko did it to Federer and Nadal in 2009, going on to beat Juan Martín del Potro in the final.
The second semi-final was a feast of rich shots and lots of soaring and dipping tennis. Sock, the last qualifier after winning in Bercy last weekend, said: “There’s a reason he’s been playing this consistently all year. That’s the reason he’s in the final.”
Having seen off the injured world No1, Rafael Nadal, in his first match, Goffin did not lack for form but his self-belief wavered. He said after beating Dominic Thiem to reach the weekend: “I’ve never found a key to beat Roger. Honestly, I don’t know what to do. But I’m going to try something – something different, something that I’ve never done in the past.” He was true to his word. As he said courtside: “I was really aggressive, hit some great forehands.” Smiling as if he had just discovered there really is a Santa Claus, he added: “Words can’t describe how I’m feeling. There is much joy, much happiness.”
With a seasonal glow, Goffin advances to Sunday’s final, the first Belgian to do so in the tournament’s 48 years. Dimitrov is the first Bulgarian.
It is hard to repel the worrying feeling, meanwhile, that tennis is leaving Andy Murray behind. As the ailing Scot watched Saturday’s semi-finals from his home in Surrey, he might have admitted privately that his Christmas will be less joyous than last year’s, although the recent addition of a baby daughter to his young family will surely ease his angst.
The 2016 champion has much to ponder: a hip that is healing only slowly and a future without Ivan Lendl, who late on Friday left him for a second time. Nobody saw that one coming.
Murray, who has not played a serious match since Wimbledon, and his team have been strangely introspective lately but it is known he will take the rest of his crew to Miami soon for two weeks of midwinter training then fly to Australia to acclimatise for his comeback in Brisbane, before the Australian Open in Melbourne.
A year after he had finally ascended to No1 in the world – and stood on the floor of the O2 Arena drinking in the applause of the crowd for beating Novak Djokovic in the final of this tournament – his world has inexorably fractured. He has tumbled to No16 in the rankings but, if he can take any comfort from Federer’s season, it might be that the Swiss was the same ranking 12 months ago – and went on to win the Australian Open.
As Federer said later of his absent rivals – Murray, Nadal, Djokovic, Stan Wawrinka, Kei Nishikori and Milos Raonic: “Coming back is always a challenge for the body. You’ve got to be extremely patient yet positive. Of course I expect greatness from them when they return – at some stage, not maybe from the very beginning. But I wouldn’t be surprised if it worked out for them as well, like it worked out for me.”
A lot of people would. Federer came back from seven months out through knee surgery to win two slams. Saturday’s loss broke a run of 13 wins, and was only his fifth of the season.
Federer was 3-1 up after 16 minutes. Although he is a great front-runner, two of his four losses this year were from a set up: against world No116 Evgeny Donskoy in Dubai at the start of the year, and against Tommy Haas, who was ranked 302 when he beat him on grass in Stuttgart.
No upset was apparent after 22 minutes, when he broke Goffin for 4-1 with a sublime backhand down the line. He held to love for 5-1 with a low chip from heaven and a cool smash at the net that left his 26-year-old opponent shrinking in his presence. It was man and boy, as they say. Three aces among 13 clean winners won Federer the first set in just over half an hour. What could possibly go wrong?
Goffin, in no mood to roll over, broke for 3-0 and held for 4-1. Federer briefly rediscovered his fluency but could not stop Goffin serving out to love to level at a set apiece.
Goffin, playing Tigerish tennis, saved a break point with a crisp volley at the start of the third, then remained focused all the way to the line. They embraced at the net, not far from where Federer’s final forehand had ended up, and the famous deed was a small but significant part of tennis history.


When the final whistle went at the end of the first ever Madrid derby at the Wanda Metropolitano, Atlético’s new home 12 miles across the city from their old one, there was no roar, but there was a little relief. A 0-0 draw suits neither side and was nothing to celebrate but at least it was not cruel, as some Atlético fans feel their history against Real has been. Instead, it was largely empty. It leaves both teams from the capital ten points behind Barcelona and showcased the reasons why that is the case. Isco apart, this was a game desperately lacking in creativity or control. Lacking goals too.
Atlético should have had a very early lead when a move – if it could really be called that – ended with Raphaël Varane nudging the ball into the path of Ángel Correa after just three minutes, and nothing much would follow for the next 87. The move had been built on errors and it ended with one too. Correa, alone in front of goal, clipped past Kiko Casilla and wide of the near post. Correa held his head while on the touchline Diego Simeone looked like he was close to tears; he could hardly have wished for a better opportunity, but it was wasted – and that is a familiar feeling this season.
Simeone’s side continued to press, Correa, Stefan Savic and Koke forming a line of three behind Antoine Griezmann and in front of Gabi and Thomas Partey. Koke couldn’t quite reach a ball flashed across from the left and soon Correa was dashing into the area on the other side before Gabi’s volley flew wide. Genuine chances were few though, for either side. When Real did threaten in those opening 20 minutes, it came via a break from deep, Ronaldo suddenly sprinting through only for Juanfran to catch him and, to huge applause, emerge with the ball. In a race between the two, he was an unexpected winner.
That was a warning, perhaps, and soon the balance tilted. Real found that if they overcame the first line of pressure, space opened beyond. They took a step forward, and more control of the ball. On the left, Isco, Karim Benzema and Marcelo made progress, the immense majority of the attacks coming on their side, but Real seemed to lack acceleration, an extra gear; imagination, too. In five minutes from the half hour, they fired off four shots. Toni Kroos had the first and best, playing a one-two with Ronaldo and shooting wide from seven yards.
Ronaldo scuffed a volley well over and then, with a long free-kick, drew a save from Jan Oblak. That would be the only shot on target of the first half. Next Kroos speared a ball to the far post, where Casemiro headed back. Sergio Ramos, diving in by the outstretched foot of Lucas, headed wide from the edge of the six-yard box – and sustained a broken nose that ruled him out of the second half, his place taken by Nacho.
Atlético changed too but the game did not change significantly; if anything, it regressed. Isco tried to get Real going but he was largely alone again. Yannick Carrasco ran but rarely made the right decision for Atlético. There was little clarity, little imagination, little pace to the play, and not much sign of a striker – either to take chances or make them. There was little threat in the movement of the men playing up front.
When Luka Modric found Ronaldo in space inside the area his poor shot went wide. There still hadn’t been a shot on target in the second half. Three changes followed immediately: Griezmann, Correa and Benzema off, Fernando Torres, Kevin Gameiro and Marco Asensio on. Gameiro clipped over Casilla, only to see the shot headed off the line. Next, Carrasco’s shot crashed into Ronaldo’s arm. Real knew a draw was worthless and took a step forward; nerves gripped in this new arena. Kroos’s shot was beaten away by Oblak and, with Ronaldo lurking, Diego Godín cleared. Then Lucas dived in to block Ronaldo’s shot with two minutes to go. Two more were added, hearts in mouths, but there was to be no drama.


David Moyes has denied that taking over from Slaven Bilic at West Ham represents his last chance in football management and the Scot is confident he can arrest a slump that has left his new side in the relegation zone.
Before Sunday’s trip to face Watford at Vicarage Road Moyes pledged to tackle the indiscipline that has undermined West Ham’s dreadful start to the campaign and led to Bilic becoming the first manager to leave the club during the course of a season since Alan Curbishley resigned in September 2008.
His replacement returns to the Premier League looking refreshed after leaving Sunderland in the summer following their relegation and, at 54, still feels he has plenty to offer despite difficult spells at Manchester United and Real Sociedad before last season’s implosion at the Stadium of Light.
“I don’t think it’s my last chance,” Moyes said. “If you look at managers in the Premier League, most have managed 10-12 clubs. Look at Jupp Heynckes, he’s had about 14 clubs and has just gone back to Bayern at 70. It’s possible to manage lots of clubs. Is this my last chance? No.”
After 11 largely successful years at Everton when they consistently punched above their weight, Moyes still has plenty of credit in the bank and, most importantly, West Ham’s co-owners, David Sullivan and David Gold, clearly trust him to turn things round quickly. But a short-term contract until the end of the season is an indication that he has, unlike Heynckes, something to prove once again, having started his management career at Preston in 1998.
Moyes, who will become only the fourth manager after Sir Alex Ferguson, Arsène Wenger and Harry Redknapp to take charge of 500 Premier League matches, admitted he will be under more pressure on Sunday than during his first Everton match in 2002, when the current caretaker, David Unsworth, scored after 30 seconds in a 2-1 win over Fulham. They went on to avoid relegation easily and, in an effort to instil some of his methods, Stuart Pearce – who made 50 appearances for West Ham between 1999 and 2001 – has been added to the coaching staff in his first post since leaving Nottingham Forest in February 2015. Moyes expects him to have a major influence on and off the pitch.
“I think Stuart Pearce will play a big role. He said we need to make sure everyone is connected with the supporters,” said Moyes. “We are not going to play at another stadium. We are playing at our stadium and we are going to be winning games over the years at our stadium and the supporters and the players need to get used to that. Stuart has brought a bit of what was here before; he knows what it was like. I hope we can pull that together. Will the supporters make it easy for us? If we win. If we don’t, it will be a lot harder.”


DAVID WARNER
Bullies bowlers and loves beating England. Was a third-innings menace in 2013-14 but England did develop a decent strategy against him in 2015. That may not work on flatter pitches, mind. Sets the tone, with the bat and in the field. Has calmed, but will never learn to resist a feisty sledge.
CAMERON BANCROFT
Made no waves for Gloucestershire in the summer until he scored 278 against Kent in his final game, the springboard for his big start to the Shield season, which has brought 442 runs in six knocks. Steady style and right-handedness should complement Warner, who has his eighth Test opening partner now Matt Renshaw’s poor Shield form has led to him being dropped.
USMAN KHAWAJA
Averages almost 64 on home soil – although he still struggles on away grounds – and the addition of experience to his inherent elegance has produced a wonderful batsman. The left-hander will cut and pull England’s bowlers to distraction should they drop the ball short and he is likely to be brutal with his attacking strokes if the tourists stray on to his pads. Oozes style.
STEVE SMITH
The battle of the captains will be fascinating and possibly series-defining. Just like Joe Root, the key for Smith is how those above him fare – if they can get him in early, England stand a chance. Technique is awkward, but so are his scoring areas for the opposition captain and his record is extraordinary.
PETER HANDSCOMB
Another unorthodox sort, but has made a fine start to his Test career and is comfortable against pace and spin. Did not pull up trees with Yorkshire in the summer, and there are some questions about his Shield form, too – he has scored one half-century in six knocks. Has English parents.
SHAUN MARSH
England are privately pleased that Australia’s No6 does not bowl, because it provides an opportunity to strain the three quicks. This is Marsh’s eighth, and surely final, recall. Stylish and, at 34, experienced, he has had a good start to the Shield summer, averaging 39 with runs against the Test attack.
TIM PAINE
Bolted straight from left field in terms of selection. Richly talented, but has kept wicket in three first-class matches in two Shield seasons and averages 19 in the past four, while his only century came 11 years ago; Darren Lehmann, nine years retired, has one more recently. Is into his 30s, unlike his batting average.
PAT CUMMINS
So fragile that he has played just 15 first-class matches and no home Tests. Looks fit and strong now but selection of Chadd Sayers hints that he may be rested for the second Test. Wants to play the Mitchell Johnson role and, used the right way, is sharp enough to be devastating.
MITCHELL STARC
England’s tail know what is coming. They are in for a dose of hooping, blasting yorkers, often from round the wicket with some reverse thrown in, too. Will operate in longer spells than Cummins, but not by much, and will cause some harm with the bat. A fearsome prospect.
NATHAN LYON
Finger spin was going out of fashion in Australia before Lyon. Well, it’s still out of fashion, but he is defying the trend. Has 269 wickets and the Gabba will be his 70th Test, which is a remarkable record for an unassuming bloke who used to earn his keep as a groundsman.
JACKSON BIRD
Known to England from his time in county cricket and should not be underestimated. No great pace but extremely accurate and does just enough with the ball. One of his eight previous Tests came in the Ashes, at Durham in 2013, and, at 30, might have felt the opportunity of more had come and gone.
JOSH HAZLEWOOD
The modern-day fast bowling version of Glenn McGrath. Country lad who hammers away back of a length with awkward bounce and finding any movement that is on offer, at a speed as quick as anything England possess. Might be expected to produce longish spells and goes into the Ashes series with 33 competitive overs under his belt since August.
CHAD SAYERS
Sayers is English in style and old school. Not quick, but swings and seams the ball and has done extremely well in day-night cricket at the Adelaide Oval, which is surely his best chance of an Ashes Test appearance. Dismissed Steve Smith there a fortnight ago and took 62 Shield wickets last summer.


Anthony Watson, full-back, 7/10 Left for dead by Koroibete for Hooper’s disallowed try and positioning at times not quite there. Tried to get things going in attack and certainly deserves another crack at No15.
Jonny May, wing, 7/10 A mixed bag. Maybe should have picked off an early interception and fumbled again soon after to put England under pressure. Chased hard and finally got his reward at the death.
Jonathan Joseph, centre, 8/10 Dealt with Australia’s two battering ram centres well in the first half, not quite so well in the second but deserved his try for his effort throughout. Much better than last week.
Owen Farrell, centre, 7/10 A calm head and a few excellent kicks but not quite the impact we perhaps expected. Just his presence helped though and was significant in getting Koroibete’s try disallowed.
Elliot Daly, wing, 8/10 Ford and Youngs looked for him with cross-field kicks and he stuck gamely to the task of chasing them and eventually reaped the rewards by beating Beale to ball for try.
George Ford, fly-half, 6/10 Kicked a lot from hand, often targeting Australia’s left wing. Clearly part of the game plan so he stuck to it well but for second consecutive week he could not provide the spark.
Ben Youngs, scrum-half, 6/10 More alert than last week, constantly looking to go quickly and set up Daly with a lovely kick with the outside of his right boot. Passing was not quite on the money.
Mako Vunipola, prop, 6/10 Another guilty of poor handling, understandable in these conditions, but could not establish himself at the scrum. Did not reach the heights of last week – maybe this was a day for Marler.
Dylan Hartley, hooker, capt, 8/10 One of his best performances as England captain. Kicked things off with great tackle on Hodge and continued in that vein thereafter. Showed good hands.
Dan Cole, prop, 6/10 Looked to be getting the better of Sio early on, but not in the eyes of the referee. Judged on his set-piece work, so a satisfactory shift. Nothing more.
Joe Launchbury, lock, 9/10 England’s answer to Ronseal – Eddie Jones knew exactly what he would get when recalling Launchbury, namely tireless work all over the pitch. Ended match with 17 tackles.
Courtney Lawes, lock, 8/10 Walloped Beale with one of his trademark big hits and snared McMahon too. Fast becoming one of England’s most consistent performers.
Chris Robshaw, flanker, 7/10 Early rumble again and covered extremely well towards the end of the first half – even if he immediately gave the ball away. Did fine back on the openside apart from a needless penalty for late hit on Beale.
Sam Underhill, flanker, 6/10 Plenty of early involvement with a couple of tackles, a couple missed as well. Offered himself to carry too before early departure. We can but hope he shakes this habit of suffering head injuries.
Nathan Hughes, No8, 7/10 Fired up from the word go and always looking to get in the faces of Australia, perhaps a little too much. Plenty of carries but his handling lets him down at times.
REPLACEMENTS: Jamie George 7 (for Hartley 57) Takes some credit for late flurry; Joe Marler 7 (for Vunipola 64) Made his tackles after coming on; Harry Williams 6 (for Cole 67) Little time to make impact; Maro Itoje 8 (for Underhill 17) Monstrous performance, albeit with a couple of penalties against; Sam Simmonds 7 (for Hughes 63) Nice pass in buildup to May’s try; Danny Care 8 (for Youngs 70) Very impressive cameo; Henry Slade 6 (for Ford 70) Could not really influence proceedings.
Kurtley Beale, full-back, 6/10 Saw a huge amount of ball, as was expected, but badly caught out for Daly’s try. Received a yellow card for a deliberate knock-on as well. Did not shy away from things but one for the scrapbook.
Marika Koroibete, wing, 8/10 Softly spoken but a hell of a game. Unlucky to have try disallowed, having made it with the initial break, and always looked lively with ball in hand. Still relatively new to union but a classy operator.
Tevita Kuridrani, centre, 6/10 Important tackle on Launchbury in the first half but a poor knock-on which ultimately led to Daly’s try. Rarely able to influence things up the middle, or out wide with Joseph opposite him.
Samu Kerevi, centre, 7/10 Enjoyed a couple of eye-catching runs in the second half – not his fault that Kuridrani could not gather his offload after one of them. A surprise to see him make way.
Reece Hodge, wing, 6/10 Came off wing to try and get involved and showed his goal-kicking skills. Reasonable under the high ball but could not find his way through traffic the way that Koroibete could.
Bernard Foley, fly-half, 6/10 An inauspicious start with a forward pass and a rank first kick at goal. Tends to need a fast start to impose himself but did make one mini-break in the second half.
Will Genia, scrum-half, 7/10 England certainly targeted him and succeeded in frustrating him in the first half. Showed his class to respond, however, making an important break early in the second half.
Scott Sio, prop, 6/10 Experienced campaigner and he stood up well to Cole at scrum-time and carried well. Not as eye-catching as his fellow prop Kepu but probably was not his kind of game.
Tatafu Polota-Nau, hooker, 6/10 One or two wobbles at the lineout and not the day to show up in the loose too often. Scrum was fine, so future Leicester Tigers hooker can be satisfied with his day’s work.
Sekope Kepu, prop, 8/10 Showed up well in the loose, hitting double figures for his number of carries and made some of them count, too. Australia’s scrum held up well, so takes plenty of credit.
Rob Simmons, lock, 6/10 Has a reputation for being little more than a good lineout option. That aspect was not perfect but he shouldered added responsibility considering Enever’s inexperience.
Blake Enever, lock, 5/10 Not a debut to remember. Came up against three superb English locks when Itoje was introduced. Struggled at lineout, too, though it was a big ask to throw him straight in.
Ned Hanigan, flanker, 7/10 Australia’s standout back-row in the first half. He was busy early on, making his tackles and doing his best to make yards. Kept taking knocks, however, and made way at half-time.
Michael Hooper, flanker, capt 5/10 Repeated offences at the breakdown, just as he was a week ago, and earned himself another yellow card. Perhaps a touch unlucky to have try disallowed – just not his day.
Sean McMahon, No8, 6/10 Talked up before the game for the balance that he brings to the back row but did not get any change out of Hughes. Is not the most imposing of No8s and it showed. .
REPLACEMENTS: Stephen Moore 5 (for Poloa‑Nau 64) In the way for Koroibete’s disallowed try; Tom Robertson 6 (for Sio 70) On periphery; Allan Alaalatoa n/a (for Kepu 67) No chance to be involved; Matt Philip n/a (for Enever 62) Barely any more experienced than Enever; Ben McCalman 6 (for Hanigan ht) Important hit on Itoje; Lopeti Timani n/a (for McMahon 79); Nick Phipps 4 (for Genia 71) Caught out for Joseph’s try; Karmichael Hunt 5 (for Kerevi 67) Couple of touches and one knock-on.


Last week’s abiding rugby image was of a smiling Kurtley Beale, clad only in his budgie smugglers, standing next to Prince William. Seven days on, it was a story of canary yellow and pursed lips. Australia and Beale had their moments, but the loss of two key players to the sin-bin and some desperately tight refereeing calls ultimately denied the visitors another victory party.
Had they kept 15 men on the field throughout, who knows? While England looked far more lively, particularly after Maro Itoje’s introduction, they were up against opponents who, on a drier day, would have been even more of a handful. Michael Cheika, now beaten by his old adversary Eddie Jones in five straight shootouts, can only move on to Scotland, lamenting what might have been.
Then again, one of the men sent to the sin-bin, the Wallabies captain, Michael Hooper, could hardly claim to be a total innocent. When he was dispatched for 10 in the 33rd minute, after a desperate spell of rearguard defence, he became the player with the most yellow cards in Tests, with eight. When Beale followed him to the sidelines for what was deemed to be a deliberate knock-on, the case for a quick blast of Coldplay’s ‘Yellow’ at half-time was overwhelming.
Given the sad death, at 64, of Malcolm Young, the founding member of AC/DC, the DJ was certainly more spoilt for choice than the Wallabies defensive organisers. It was a tribute to the visitors’ resilience and a reflection on England’s average game management that they had conceded no further points by the time they were restored to a full deck.
In the end, though, they could not escape the clutches of Jones, the New Zealand referee, Ben O’Keefe, or the Irish TMO, Simon McDowell.
Twickenham is growing accustomed to Australian coaches swearing on camera and Cheika was turning the November air blue long before half-time. The Wallabies coach felt Hooper’s disallowed first-half try should have stood on the basis that Marika Koroibete was behind the kicker and the supporting Hooper had made a modicum of effort to stop and get back onside, if not fully retreat.
Conclusive proof that this was not to be Australia’s day duly arrived in the 54th minute. Had Tevita Kuridrani held on to Samu Kerevi’s offload, the big outside centre could have been under the posts. Instead, thanks to the most hairline of touchline calls, the same breathless passage of play concluded with Elliot Daly scoring up the other end. By the time Koroibete was crucially adjudged to have been held up over England’s line in the final quarter, Cheika had his head in his hands.
At least it will be a day Blake Enever will never forget. The 26-year-old, from the Sunshine Coast, was picked for the tour on the back of his form for Canberra Vikings in the domestic NRC competition and his selection in the second row, in place of the injured Adam Coleman, qualified him as the latest in a distinguished line of genuine Australian bolters.
He tried his heart out, but Itoje and Joe Launchbury were clearly the most effective back-five forwards on view. At least Australia can welcome back David Pocock and Israel Folau, among others, next year but, for now, their dreams of overhauling England as the world’s No2-ranked side are still on hold.


Joey Carbery suffered a suspected broken arm in Ireland’s edgy victory over Fiji, Joe Schmidt revealed afterwards, and the Leinster playmaker will definitely miss Saturday’s Test against Argentina though how long he will be out remains unclear.
Carbery’s two missed conversions almost proved costly, as Ian Keatley’s two late penalties squeezed Schmidt’s side home. The head coach said: “I think he’s fractured his left forearm. I can’t absolutely confirm that but that appears to be the case. That will mean he won’t take any further part in the series for us.”
Ireland squandered a 17-3 lead built up by tries from Darren Sweetnam, Dave Kearney and Jack Conan, and almost paid the price for Carbery’s two missed kicks.
Ireland made 13 changes from last weekend’s record 38-3 victory over South Africa, and endured some nervy moments en route to their slender win over the eye-catching Pacific islanders. Henry Seniloli and Timoci Nagusa scored tries for Fiji, with Ben Volavola slotting 10 points from the tee.
Keatley’s two penalties won the game for Ireland after Fiji had levelled at 17-17, leaving Schmidt relieved – but also hailing the 22-year-old Carbery’s performance on only his second start in six caps.
“Joey was a bit special the way he cut the line and got that pass into the hands of Darren Sweetnam, who finished comfortably for the try,” said Schmidt. “I thought Joey’s ability to organise others is coming along; his vision is really good. The threat he poses at the line himself, he ducked and dived, but he’s brave, potentially to a fault. He pays no heed as to what’s in front of him.”
The versatile Carbery enjoyed his first start of the season at fly-half against Fiji, having featured at full-back for Leinster this term. Ireland view Carbery as a natural No10 and want the New Zealand-born talent to become a genuine alternative to the British & Irish Lion Johnny Sexton.
Schmidt insisted Ireland must accept Leinster’s need to deploy both Carbery and Sexton in their starting lineup, even if it denies the youngster regular opportunities at fly-half.
“Look, it is what it is, it’s an unfortunate situation for us, but I totally understand it,” said Schmidt of Leinster fielding Carbery at full-back. “They’ve got Johnny Sexton at Leinster, so Joey takes his opportunities at full-back.
“I just appreciate that he gets game time and is in good condition to play. I’d love him to play 10 more often, it would help his development, but it’s a needs-must situation.”
Fiji’s head coach, John McKee, said his side will leave Dublin frustrated not to steal victory, having levelled at 17-17 and again at 20-20. “There’s some frustration for us, we had chances to score another try and secure the win,” said McKee. “To come back from 17-3 down was a great effort, but maybe that took too much out of us.”


Eddie Jones praised the television match official system after three calls went England’s way in their record victory over Australia, but Michael Cheika said the process confused him as the war of words between the former Randwick team-mates continued.
Australia had two tries ruled out on review while England’s first, scored by the wing Elliot Daly, was allowed after the officials took four minutes to decide whether the ball had grazed the touchline before Daly got to it. In addition, the Wallabies lost two players to the sin-bin and were down to 13 men each side of the interval.
Jones bristled when asked in the post-match media conference whether his team had been lucky having said immediately after the game on television that his side had “enjoyed the bounce of the ball”. “How are we lucky?” the England head coach replied. “Why do we have referees? Why do we have television match officials? They do 10 replays of the video and they make a decision. How are we lucky? We had the bounce of the ball otherwise Jonny May would not have scored his try, but that has nothing to do with the referee or the TMO.”
Cheika said he struggled to understand why some reviews lasted for longer than others. He was referring to the four minutes taken to rule Daly’s try legitimate while, in the first half, the Australia captain, Michael Hooper, had a try ruled out after a review lasting seconds. “I am not sure about the process,” said Cheika. “How many replays does it take? I am not ranking them because it was not the Academy Awards. Whatever the TMO wants, he wants.
“We lost a try for offside, but it is obvious English players were offside. There is no point in making submissions to World Rugby; you just get on with it.”
Hooper said he felt he should have been awarded the try when England were leading 3-0. “I was in front of the kicker but worked my way back so that when Marika Koroibete played it, I was behind him. That is why I went for the ball and I am not sure what I should have done.”
Jones was caught on camera swearing last week during the victory over Argentina and Cheika was filmed following an expletive with the word cheats during the first half. “When you go down to 13 men, you are steaming,” he said. “Is this question a reflection of what the game has become?”
It was England’s 21st victory in 22 matches under Jones and they should make it 22 wins next weekend against a Samoa side who lost in Romania on Saturday. “We will sit down and decide whether to make changes or stick with this side and see if we can play better,” he said.
“It was a tough old game against Australia, a great Test between two even teams. It was an arm-wrestle and we stuck at it. You had to take your opportunities and we did that better than them, smart tactically in really difficult conditions which we played superbly.”
England consolidated their position as second in the rankings behind New Zealand. Daly said: “That was really important. We want to be the best team in the world and you could see today that we are growing as a team.”


This was an extraordinary attempt to overturn 112 years of hurt – and for a moment Murrayfield, with their darling Stuart Hogg streaking down the left in the last seconds, thought they might have the glory, at last, of a win over New Zealand. Alas, it was not to be, but this was their most valiant attempt for more than 30 years. How they played from the off, and more than that, how they played till the very end. They looked for long periods – including nearly all of the first half – by some distance the better team.
But we know that is never enough against this lot. The All Blacks were off their best, but they know how to maximise return on the scoreboard like no other team. And even when off their best they can summon moments of the highest art to move the most curmudgeonly, as well as the coldest judge of all, the scoreboard.
Three second-half tries did for the home team, despite their best efforts. Scotland, under new management or not, can play – that much we know – but the next stage in their development, indeed in that of every other team on the planet bar the best, is to learn to translate that into capital on the board.
Scotland scored two second-half tries themselves, and just as tellingly forced two All Blacks into the sin-bin – New Zealand, incredibly, played the whole of that crucial final quarter a man short. During it they scored the sweetest try of the game, a dazzling concert of running lines, stealth and skill. It seemed to have killed the game, in the 67th minute, but Scotland regrouped for one last assault , and it nearly came off.
No one would have begrudged them. They certainly looked the sharper side in the first 40, their biggest problem being the score at the end of it. To turn round level at 3-3 was not only scant reward for their dynamism and invention, it was light punishment for an All Blacks outfit who looked sluggish and only half-involved.
Hogg tormented them whenever he got his hands on the ball, which he did as much as he could, no doubt suffering from what he perceives to be unfinished business against this lot, having missed the Lions Test series through injury this summer. If he wasn’t leaving luminaries such as Kieran Read clutching at air, he was sending monstrous kicks spiralling over their heads, scudding sweetly into corners.
For all the excitement, unease at Scotland’s failure to shift the scoreboard beyond Finn Russell’s early penalty gathered quietly. It worsened when Beauden Barrett landed a penalty just before the break, which is, of course, New Zealand’s favourite time of the match.
Well, that and just after the break. Sure enough, the shadow hanging over Murrayfield darkened at the start of the second half. Rieko Ioane was the one All Black who had looked in the mood, and he reinforced that impression when he combined with Codie Taylor twice for the game’s first try. And try two followed within minutes. From a driven lineout, Sonny Bill Williams’s chip was touched down imperiously by Damian McKenzie. At 15-3, it suddenly felt as if the party was over.
It wasn’t. Scotland found another gear. A series of penalties had them hammering at the line. When Sam Cane committed the third penalty in quick succession, he was first to go to the bin, and Jonny Gray forced his way over from close range. Russell converted, and Scotland were back within a score.
New Zealand responded with that divine third try of theirs, the kind they, better than anyone else, always seem to pull off at crucial moments. From a scrum, a whirl of runners bewildered Scotland’s midfield. Williams stepped in at 10, half-broke through Russell and offloaded to McKenzie, and he found Barrett who had quietly snuck round to the outside. A brilliant try – and one scored with 14 men.
They remained down to 14 for the rest of the match. Scotland came again, and just as Cane was about to return Wyatt Crockett was sent to the bin too, offside as Scotland hammered again to within inches. Another penalty was conceded after he had gone, which might have yielded yet a third yellow. It was not to be. Scotland scrummed the penalty and that seven-man pack drove them off the ball for a penalty.
Surely that was the game now, but still Scotland pressed – and handled, how they handled. Another concert had Hogg off down the right, and his chip set up Huw Jones for a beauty of a score off Tommy Seymour’s inside ball.
It left Scotland with two minutes to win it. For a split-second Murrayfield thought they had it, erupting when Hogg hared away down the left, one last time. A brilliant tackle by Barrett thwarted him, and his desperate inside pass was forward. Murrayfield, agonisingly, was denied its most famous moment, but they roared loud, the spirit coursing again through rugby in these parts.

Referee Matthew Carley (Eng) Game rating 8/10
John Barclay, Scotland’s captain, has hailed his team’s narrow defeat to the All Blacks as one the best matches he has played in. “That was a proper Test match,” he said. “It just went back and forth. At 3-3 [at half-time] you probably would have thought that’s a boring game but both teams were playing with tempo. You saw two teams going at it hard. We were 12 points behind but we just kept going. We had a great mentality.
“We’re gutted. We feel that maybe that’s one that got away but also we’re very proud of the intensity and effort of what we did. To call it brave undervalues the skill. It’s very hard to play at that level and that speed with skill. That’s not brave, that’s skill, under pressure, under fatigue – and that’s the exciting thing for this team.”
New Zealand claimed the win with three second-half tries, while Scotland scored two in the same period. It seemed New Zealand had sealed it with an excellent third try in the final quarter, only for Scotland to respond with their second. Then, in the final play of the game, Stuart Hogg streaked down the left, only to be felled by a brilliant cover tackle.
“Hogg is a dangerous player, isn’t he?” said Kieran Read, New Zealand’s captain, to the BBC. “Luckily, we have a quick player too in Beauden Barrett. It was fantastic scrambling from both sides.”


Once again, Paul Pogba is doing his snake-hips shuffle beneath the Stretford End and Zlatan Ibrahimovic – straight-backed, chest puffed out, knee fixed – can be seen soaking up the crowd’s acclaim. It still might not be enough when it comes to the task of catching, and overhauling, Manchester City at the top of the Premier League – but it must still feel reassuring for Manchester United’s supporters to see these two wearing the team’s colours again.
For Ibrahimovic, it was his first appearance since his cruciate ligaments were ruptured in April and it was a tremendous cheer when he came on in the 77th minute. All the goals had gone in by that stage but, Zlatan being Zlatan, one imagines he is certain he can still have a considerable influence on this season’s title race. He will be outraged, undoubtedly, that an acrobatic volley was saved by the Newcastle goalkeeper, Rob Elliot, to deny him a comeback goal in the final moments.
No matter. This was still a satisfying evening for José Mourinho in many different ways. Pogba was excellent, capping his return from two months out with the team’s third goal, and Romelu Lukaku should also feel better after ending his barren run. Lukaku lashed in his goal in the manner of someone who had grown weary of being reminded he had not scored for his club since 30 September.
It was the seventh occasion this season Mourinho’s side have scored four times, with Anthony Martial and Chris Smalling also on target, but perhaps the most impressive part was what it said about the team’s resilience bearing in mind Newcastle had opened the scoring, via Dwight Gayle, and played superbly in the opening half an hour.
It was the first league goal scored by an opponent at Old Trafford this season and it took a while for Mourinho’s players to shake their heads clear. Newcastle could certainly feel aggrieved to be losing at half-time and will think back to the chance Jacob Murphy could not convert six minutes after Gayle’s precise strike. Newcastle looked impressive for long spells but that missed chance, with the opportunity to go 2-0 ahead, was crucial bearing in mind the way the complexion of the game changed before half-time.
The home team also had the taller players and there was always the danger Newcastle might come up short in defence, particularly with Jamaal Lascelles among their list of absentees. Martial was the first to take advantage, outjumping DeAndre Yedlin to head in Pogba’s cross for the equaliser and when the next goal arrived in first-half stoppage time it was another back-post header, albeit with the ball coming in from the opposite side. Smalling had drifted free and was inside the six-yard area when Ashley Young picked him out to apply the decisive touch.
Even then, there was still time for Isaac Hayden to run clear before half-time only to be kept out by David de Gea’s save. Ultimately, though, Mourinho was not exaggerating with his assessment of the next 45 minutes. “The second half was ours,” he said. And Pogba’s performance? “Top,” the United manager added, matter-of-factly.
It did not always click and Newcastle kept on attacking, making it another difficult occasion for Victor Lindelof, deputising for the injured Phil Jones. Lindelof has found it tough since his £30m move from Benfica and Gayle’s 14th-minute goal was another ordeal for the Sweden international. Yedlin, Newcastle’s attacking right-back, created the opening with a surging run and Lindelof’s slip left Gayle on his own. The striker’s finish was impeccable, aimed to De Gea’s right and going in off the upright.
Newcastle were terrific in the opening exchanges and Mourinho even felt moved to praise Rafael Benítez, one of his old enemies, for the away team’s tactics. Not many teams are brave enough to come here with two strikers but perhaps Benítez sensed the home defence, also missing Eric Bailly, might be more vulnerable than usual. If so, he was absolutely correct.
Lukaku also looked a little hesitant early on, as might be expected for someone who had failed to score in the previous seven games. That, however, felt like a deception by the end. His goal was a demonstration of raw power, smashing his shot into the roof of the net after a bulldozing run, a one-two with Juan Mata and a wishy-washy challenge from Florian Lejeune, and the striker was also prominently involved when Pogba made it 3-1 nine minutes into the second half.
Lukaku’s cross was expertly delivered and it was a lovely cushioned header from Marcus Rashford to direct the ball across the six-yard area, leaving Pogba with a tap-in. Pogba danced for the crowd and the final word went to Ibrahimovic. Had he ever doubted, at the age of 36, that he would recover? “Never,” he said. “Because lions don’t recover like humans.”


The RFU is spending £50m rebuilding the eastern half of Twickenham. It is putting up a new rooftop rose garden, restaurant and music stage to make the old cabbage patch more welcoming. England, and Eddie Jones, of course, want to do the very opposite thing. The harder their visitors find it here, the happier they’ll be. And since the East Stand is a mess at the moment, all scaffolding, plyboard and piles of breezeblocks, Jones’s work is a lot further along than the builders’. England have not lost here since he took charge, their last defeat that 20-point thrashing, so much more painful than even that scoreline suggests, to Australia in the pool stages of the World Cup. A lot has changed since then, and this Saturday it felt an ugly, unforgiving, intimidating place to come and play. Jones will be delighted.
Twickenham always comes alive when England are playing Australia, since it’s one of those rivalries which can’t be anything but exciting. Even when the weather is this foul, with the rain sweeping in under the roof, falling so thick and fine that the spotlights in the upper tier of the stadium seemed to be lost in fog, while down at ground level the temperature was so cold that great clouds of steam came rising off players as the two packs set about the scrums. The game was only three minutes old when the crowd broke into Swing Low for the first time. But then they already had plenty to sing about. The urgency of England’s play in those opening 10 minutes suggested Jones had plenty to say about England’s listless day against Argentina last Saturday.
Australia were rattled by a couple of early carries from Sam Underhill, and another from Nathan Hughes, rampaging away off the back of a scrum, through Michael Hooper and Will Genia, who made him look like Gulliver throwing off the Lilliputians. And the first time Kurtley Beale got the ball in broken play he was battered down by Courtney Lawes in the kind of bone-jarring tackle that will soon be up on the YouTube highlights reel. England were playing with furious intent. At every breakdown, you could hear Englishmen screaming “nine! nine! nine!” as they looked to close down Genia before he could get Australia away. Michael Cheika said before the match that England would look to hit Genia with late tackles, but the opposite was true. They were busting to get to him early.
This Australian side, though, are a tough lot. And when Underhill went off for a head injury assessment, they regrouped and wrested back control. Though since Maro Itoje came on in Underhill’s place, England were hardly any weaker for the loss. From then on, the game became a wild old stramash of a match, all flailing limbs and flying bodies, slipping boots and screwy kicks, lung-busting runs, last-gasp tackles, the ball as slippery as a second-hand car salesman and the grass as slick as his suit. The only good chances anyone had to catch their breath, half-time aside, was during all the long delays while the TMO tried to figure out exactly what was going on in the last frantic passage of play.
With 30 minutes to play, England were in the thick of a desperate contest, the score was 6-3 and Australia had weathered a stretch in which they lost both Hooper and Beale to the sin-bin. England, then, had failed to impose themselves on a team that was, for a brief moment, down to 13 men. Which tells you plenty about how resourceful this Australia side is. England just couldn’t seem to find a way ahead. A brutal lineout drive, joined by Owen Farrell and George Ford, was stopped just short. And when Ford found a little space out wide on the wing with a deft floated pass, the move came to nothing because the man on the other end of it was Dylan Hartley rather than one of the rapier-quick backs.
The game broke open, in the end, on a lucky bounce of the ball. It landed on the very edge of the touchline and turned back infield. Elliot Daly got the toe of his boot to it just before Beale could gather it in and chased the kick down to score. There were what felt like an endless series of replays, some in super closeup, before the TMO decided there wasn’t conclusive proof that the ball had been in touch. So the try stood. It felt like one in a series of unlucky breaks for the Australians. Cheika didn’t much care for the referee, Ben O’Keeffe, before this match. He bawled him out after Australia drew with South Africa 27-27 in Bloemfontein in September. Since his team had two men sent to the sin-bin, and two tries disallowed, he’s unlikely to have changed his mind about him now.
Jones, though, was positively purring after yet another Twickenham victory, as happy as the cat with the cream. Three tries in the final 10 minutes meant that this was England’s record win against Australia. And if that margin was so flattering that it felt like the scoreboard could have been airbrushed, England still deserved to win, if only because they somehow managed to hold themselves together for 60 minutes and then scramble out from all the confusion to find a way to victory.


When England ram-raided the Australians in 2010-11, it was the home side’s lowest mark in a quarter of a century. The obliteration resulted in a full-scale review of the elite game in the country. “It reads like the school report of an idiot child,” opined Gideon Haigh of the finished product. The Ashes debacle had essentially knocked off the national captain, coach and chairman of selectors.
The public’s response was just as brutal and Steve Smith’s involvement became emblematic of all that was purported to be wrong. He wasn’t helped at all by the instructions given to him when brought into the side for the third Test of the series. “I’ve been told that I’ve got to come into the side and be fun,” he said before the match at Perth. “It’s about having energy in the field and making sure I’m having fun and making sure everyone else around is having fun, whether it be telling a joke or something like that.”
Predictably, Andrew Strauss’s side lapped up news of the chubby new prankster on the scene. “Tell us a joke, Smithy!” they’d roar when he came to the crease. The commentariat had their fun as well. “Impractical leg-breaks, hopeful bunts and dinner-lady hair,” Phil Walker, now editor-in-chief of Wisden Cricket Monthly, wrote of Smith’s reputation. He was dropped two matches later. Welcome, young fella, to international sport.
“It didn’t bother me much at the time,” Smith recalls of his cyclonic introduction to Ashes cricket. “I didn’t make the most of it. I wasn’t good enough in that period, but that opportunity gave me a sense of what I needed to do, so I was able to go away and formulate a plan that could work.”
RC Robertson-Glasgow in his Wisden essay of 1949, marking Sir Donald’s Bradman’s retirement, wrote: “No one ever laughed about Bradman. He was no laughing matter.” He also observed of Bradman that “no one before had ever been quite so fit, quite so ruthless”. Those traits became central tenets during Smith’s two years in the international wilderness. He spent that vital period in his career cutting weight, gaining focus and laying the foundation for a more meaningful tilt next time around.
I always had the belief in my ability. I just needed something to prove it to myself.
Chris Rogers played 24 Tests alongside Smith as both men gained an opportunity to start anew at Trent Bridge during the 2013 Ashes. He saw a player with potentially profound gifts, but what stood out was persistence. “I’ve seen very few players as committed as he is,” says Rogers. “He has changed himself from being a chilled Bondi surfie to a focused and driven leader. His swing is so unique that it has taken literally thousands of hours to perfect.”
That swing defined the innings which Smith now describes as the one that got the whole masterful show on the road. Perth was again the scene, the third Test of 2013‑14. At this point, after 28 Test innings, he averaged 33 and had gone beyond 50 only six times. His selection wasn’t quite a Test-to-Test proposition, but it wouldn’t be long before it was.
He got off the mark dancing at Graeme Swann and depositing the spinner over his head. he purpose that signalled what was to come. He clipped Jimmy Anderson then pulled Stuart Broad with a confidence that belied his record. “Avit Geezer!” read a crowd sign when he put Swann into the crowd a second time. Despite Australia being pinned at 143 for five, by stumps Smith would ensure that England would, indeed, be having it.
It was the succession of front-foot pulls as he neared three figures that reinforced the sense that Australian cricket had a live one on its hands. On-drives too, leapt on from well outside off stump and thumped down the ground like it was nothing at all. Another nonconformist slap through midwicket raised Smith’s first ton in Australia, with a leaping celebration more in keeping with what you would now expect from David Warner.
“It was a huge moment for me,” Smith recalls. “It really gave me a lot of confidence to know that I could score runs against some really good bowlers. I needed one of those knocks to know that I was good enough and that I could be successful. That really turned things around for me. I always had the belief in my ability. I just needed something to prove it to myself. This gave me a lot of confidence to know that I could do it against anyone.”
Since that watershed day, he has averaged 70 across 76 innings, 35 times scoring north of a half-century. In the 140 years they’ve been playing the game, only two – Bradman and Sunil Gavaskar – reached 20 centuries in fewer innings. Smith doing so in his 99th, at Dharamsala. Not bad, considering it took 23 attempts to locate his first.
“I probably didn’t look back and reflect on much until my 50th Test match at the SCG [this January against Pakistan] and after that game the team doctor, Peter Brukner, said I am one of three players to have played 50 Tests and averaged 60. Now with 20 hundreds, and hopefully a lot more cricket in front of me, it would be nice to get up there.”
By the age of 28 and any measure, Smith has earned admission to the pantheon of Australia’s immortals. You know how it runs: from Bradman, Harvey and Chappell to Border, Waugh and Ponting in the modern era. There’s a futility in comparing Smith with these names, but an inevitability that he will be given his average beats all-comers since Bradman. Smith, understandably, is reluctant to play along. “I’ve obviously achieved a lot in the last few years but I’d like to do a lot more to be mentioned in that sort of category.”
Asking a proper cricket question of Smith gets a proper cricket answer, rather than a prepared soundbite. “I read everything,” he says bluntly of the scrutiny that comes with being captain, a job usually identified as Australia’s second most important, after that of the prime minister. “You can learn a lot from those things and if I don’t agree with it I use it as motivation to do better and change someone’s opinion.”
England now do not dare underestimate Smith. Before that most recent Ashes series, he had made a rapid rise to the top of the ICC Test batting rankings. Swann, for one, couldn’t quite believe it and, from the safety of the commentary box, said as much. Surely he would be found out and trapped in front time and again in English conditions, said others. In the end, he was out that way – but only once, when on a Test-best 215 at Lord’s. Another ton came at The Oval. He earned respect from them at last in the only way he knew how: through a shedload of runs.
At Brisbane on Thursday it will be the first time Smith wears the captain’s blazer for an Ashes Test. Much is made of his desire to lead through his actions, but his words will be pored over now in ways they have never been before – especially before that first ball.
When Smith took over as captain after the 2015 Ashes, the buzzword was “adaptation”. Playing in England, they had a problem with the swinging ball, then in the subcontinent when it spun. Naturally, he wanted to break that cycle and lead a team as consistent as they are on the typically true tracks of home.
After a 3-0 hiding at the hands of Sri Lanka in mid-2016, the Asian problem was the first priority. In India expectations were exceeded simply by making the hosts bat twice, but meaningful progress was made. In Bangladesh, results were mixed with the exception of Warner, who finally found a way to translate his dominance to that foreign theatre. But where Smith and company could come a cropper in the Ashes is that nagging, hooping ball, the way South Africa toyed with them a year ago, winning the Test series in Australia and routing his side 5-0 in the one-dayers before that. A remodelled line-up found a degree of stability in consecutive pink-ball Test wins over South Africa at Adelaide and Pakistan at Brisbane but starting this Sheffield Shield season, with the pink ball, it was familiar carnage.
With the notable exceptions of Warner and Usman Khawaja, swing flummoxed batsmen from coast to coast. “I wish I knew,” Smith replies when asked why the vulnerability persists. “It is a difficult one. It is just about guys finding a way to get through those difficult periods. If it is tough, that’s when you really need to step up. I don’t think we have seen enough lately from the state cricketers and those trying to put their hands up. We need some of those people to do the business when it is tough.”
He doesn’t dispute that the day/nighter at Adelaide will be “quite suited to them” – by them, he means the wily old tag-team of Anderson and Broad. It’s a major shift since the last time England were in the country, the City of Churches bitumen replaced by a sporting pitch built for old-fashioned seamers to keep the ball at its pinkest when artificial light takes over. As the second Test of the five, it emphasises the importance of the opener at Brisbane, a venue where Australia haven’t lost for nigh on 30 summers. “It is obviously going to be incredibly important,” Smith reinforces. “The Gabba has been a bit of a fortress for us. And then we will deal with Adelaide.”
“A miracle has moved from among us” was the title of Robertson-Glasgow’s essay. For Smith, he doesn’t like it laid on quite that thick. “Those guys are absolute legends,” he says of the big beasts of Australian batting who came before him, before adding: “There is no reason why one day I can’t get to that status.”
Reclaiming the Ashes on home soil, and maintaining his batting form in the process, would set him well on the way. More than piling up runs, though, perhaps he could mimic another Bradman trait: the neat and ruthless smile the great man wore while carving up bowlers. England may have laughed at Smith on first meeting but if he leads an Ashes victory at the first time of asking, he will ensure that he can grin right back.

“I wanted to do it and they wanted to come,” Kenny Dalglish says simply on a quiet morning in Liverpool as he remembers how, in April 1989, he led his daughter Kelly and son, Paul, past a vast sea of flowers covering the ground at Anfield and headed up onto the Kop to honour the 96 people who had died that month at Hillsborough. “The kids had been at the game and so it was traumatic for them but it was also an unforgettable experience on the Kop.”
Dalglish was then the 38-year-old manager of Liverpool. Kelly was 13 and Paul was 12. Liverpool had asked him to become their player-manager almost four years earlier, on 30 May 1985, the day after the Heysel Stadium disaster when 39 people lost their lives at the club’s European Cup final against Juventus.
Heysel and Hillsborough opened up a compassion and desire in Dalglish to help others that explains why, beyond his sumptuous brilliance as a footballer and the 20 major trophies he inspired Liverpool to win as a player and a manager, he remains so revered on Merseyside. But in his company it is easy to forget the King Kenny mythology and to warm to him as the most human, if complicated, of men.
A moving and powerful new film, Kenny, captures all that Dalglish achieved and endured during his playing career and first managerial stint at Liverpool. It is made even more resonant by the usually reticent Dalglish’s willingness to talk relatively openly. The participation of his four children and wife, Marina, alongside old family film of them at home, adds to the poignancy.
Dalglish admits he never spoke about Hillsborough. So was his decision to take Kelly and Paul on to the Kop a way of sharing some of his turbulent emotions without discussing them? “I’m sure the deed was greater than a million words about it would have been. The two kids had gone straight back to school after Hillsborough and it felt important to show them how simplistic but beautiful it was on the Kop. It was better than me trying to explain things.”
He smiles wryly. “We took them out of school – and we’d be fined if we did that today. But how great was the education for them that day? Paul said he wanted to put his teddies up. So I took them in on the Friday morning and tied them up before anyone was in.”
There is a pause as the 66-year-old Dalglish remembers tying the teddy bears, one in Celtic hoops and the other in Liverpool red, to the terraces at an empty Anfield all those years ago.
In the film, Paul describes how, on the Kop, he finally broke down and cried in his father’s arms. But as Kelly Cates, Dalglish’s eldest daughter and an accomplished football broadcaster, suggests, her dad never addressed his own grief. “My only thought was to help somebody else,” he says. “If it means you cut yourself out of the deal that was no problem for me. If somebody else needed you, you helped them. Marina and I were brought up that way. Her mum and dad came down from Glasgow to look after the kids while we were at the funerals. I wouldn’t change what I did. Whether or not I’ve missed out looking after myself doesn’t matter. You can handle that.”
Dalglish is a product of his time, and an example of all that is admirable about working-class families in 20th-century Glasgow and Liverpool, but it also means he is hardwired not to speak about his own vulnerabilities. The film ripples with the humour and happy intimacy of family life – despite Dalglish being torn apart on the inside and covered in a rash on the outside. He was not easy to live with during those dark days but the strength of his marriage to Marina seems obvious. Surely they spoke about his feelings after Hillsborough?
“No. We spoke more about the families and what they were going through. We wouldn’t speak about ourselves.”
Yet they remembered their worry that Paul might be one of those crushed and suffocated at Hillsborough. How long did Dalglish fear the worst for Paul? Fifteen minutes? “A wee bit longer than that,” he says softly. “But I knew he was OK before I made that announcement [when Dalglish addressed the Hillsborough crowd]. That was before four o’clock because I remember walking through the kitchens and the radio was giving the half-time scores. The trouble started at six minutes past three … so I was worried about Paul for more than half an hour. He was with the Liverpool supporters and had walked through the Leppings Lane end. I saw him in the tunnel and all you heard was me saying: ‘There he is!’”
That moment must have been one of surging relief? “Yeah, but I was lucky I had that moment. Many people did not have that good fortune.”
The wounds were ripped open again by the lies told by the Sun and the police. Dalglish emits a bleak, incredulous sound. “It was unbelievable. We saw how the Liverpool fans went to help people who were suffering. Ripping up advertising boards to use as stretchers, trying to care for them on the ground. How could others have lied? It was unimaginable.”
He has spoken of his gratitude that many of the families have found, in his word, “closure”, now justice has finally been done. Have Dalglish and his family reached their own closure?
“I don’t know what closure would be for us,” he says. “As long as we’re living we will support the families. So … we wouldn’t have a closure. I wouldn’t have a closure. At least the families have been totally exonerated. The families have been punished doubly by losing their loved ones and by spending the rest of their lives trying to get justice and solace.”
Dalglish’s life has also been tarnished by loss and hurt. Yet, as he and the film convey, it has been lit by happiness and glory. Watching Kenny is a reminder of his greatness as a footballer. He played with such skill and intelligence it’s hard to think of many better players in the history of British football. The dazzling vision and goals he scored illustrate why George Best insisted Dalglish would always be the first player he picked. “For me,” Dalglish says, “the best footage in the film is the private family footage. That’s more important than the football. I’ve seen the football. I know what happens.”
It’s still a remarkable story of how a Rangers supporter crossed the divide to play for Celtic where, Dalglish believes, “I could not have got a better education in football. Big Jock [Stein] was an encyclopaedia of football – not just facts and figures but of how and where to play. We all loved the ball at Celtic.”
That education was deepened at Liverpool and Dalglish recalls the managers he venerated – with Bill Shankly, Bob Paisley and Joe Fagan preceding him in a stately line. His own first managerial task was to lay a wreath at Liverpool’s Catholic Cathedral for all those who died at Heysel. Before the game a group of Liverpool’s supporters had charged at the Juventus fans – and, in the horrendous crush as a wall collapsed, most of the victims were Italian. Did he felt the weight of his role immediately, aged 34? “No. It was my responsibility. I wanted to do it.”
Dalglish had also been at Ibrox, as a Celtic junior, on the night of a different tragedy when 66 people died in a crush on a stairway as they tried to leave an Old Firm match in 1971. He withstood such adversity, at much personal cost, but the loneliness of management must have been as hard from the start? “No – at the outset it was brilliant. I was well-protected. Peter Robinson [Liverpool’s chief executive at the time] was the best administrator football has seen. Old Bob was upstairs if I needed help and I had Ronnie Moran and Roy Evans in the boot room. It didn’t seem lonely at first.”
Eventually, Hillsborough took its toll and he resigned in February 1991, after a chaotic 4-4 draw with Everton when he felt unable to make any more decisions. Before then he had been successful and resilient – winning the Double in his first season in charge. “Alan Hansen said it was the worst Liverpool team he played in. He was part of it so he made a great contribution [Dalglish laughs]. We’d been in the European Cup final in May 1985 and this was the ’85-86 season. People think there was very little change but Craig Johnston and Jan Molby played more regularly. We signed Steve McMahon, and Alan Kennedy and Phil Neal were replaced by two young full‑backs in Stevie Nicol and Jim Beglin. It was a testing experience for everyone after Heysel but it felt seamless because there was no shouting or bawling. We didn’t do too badly.”
Dalglish created a more thrilling side when, after the sale of Ian Rush to Juventus, “we signed John Aldridge in the January [of 1987] and John Barnes and Peter Beardsley in the summer. I had an idea the chemistry would be good between me, Peter and Aldo … while Barnsey seemed the logical choice to feed goals to Aldo. Then we signed Ray Houghton who’d played with Aldo at Oxford. I tried my best to put together a team that looked good on paper but we had to prove it on the pitch – and they were different class.
“People talk about us beating Nottingham Forest 5-0 as the best but I’ve not got a league table of performances. There was a 4-0 game against QPR when they were top of the table. They came to Anfield early on in the season and, Jesus, Barnsey scored a couple of amazing goals. That wasn’t bad – but beating Forest 5-0 had to be a great performance. Whether it was the best is open to conjecture.”
Dalglish smiles – as he does when remembering his success in managing Blackburn to the Premier League title in 1994-95. “Blackburn was a fairytale. That was romantic. When I was approached to become manager, they were second bottom of what we call the Championship now. I had a few discussions with people there. In the meantime Tony Parks had been caretaker manager and he took them up to mid-table. I thought: ‘Well done, Tony [Dalglish laughs again]. Brilliant. That makes it a wee bit easier.’ I thought I’d have a go on the premise Tony stayed. I also brought in Ray Harford – brilliant feller and a brilliant coach. At the end of the first year we went up through the play‑offs, beating Leicester 1-0. We then signed [Alan] Shearer and were away. Finished fourth, then second, then champions.”
His humour is evident again even when remembering how he lost his father at Blackburn. “My dad died on a Saturday, watching the scores come through. I think we won as well [Dalglish chuckles]. It was a good way to go.”
Does he miss being a manager? “It’s fantastic working with the players but the demands now, especially from the media, are intense. It’s understandable because when you look at the money being ploughed in you’ve got to pay some penance for that.”
The bond between players and fans has also diminished. “The biggest factor is cameraphones. Players aren’t allowed to be themselves. As soon as they’re out someone takes a picture. It’s changed from when we had the freedom to enjoy ourselves – and only the manager gave you a bollocking for drinking. Look at social media now. Someone takes a picture and they might not post it for four days or four weeks. But when they do post it people assume it’s live. So footballers are frightened of trying to be normal now. They’re terrified of fabrication.”
Is he hopeful that, in the next few years, Liverpool, now under Jürgen Klopp, might win the league for the first time since they lifted their third title under Dalglish in 1990 – with their last trophy being the League Cup won during his second tenure in 2012? “How long it takes them to win the league again is less important than the fact we have the right guy without a doubt. He’s going to give us the best possible chance to win the title.
“But this season Manchester City have been fantastic. You want your own team to be successful but that doesn’t mean you turn a blind eye to someone playing such entertaining football. City just hit you from everywhere. But as somebody said the other day you’re not competing against owners now. You’re competing against countries. Here’s a wee stat for you. When Man City played Liverpool they had a back five – which cost £210m. Kyle Walker was suspended. That’s another £50m. How can a football team, in three years, spend so much on a defence? We never even counted the new goalie. I don’t know what financial fair play is. Where are the restraints?”
Dalglish says all this without rancour – just in acknowledgement of how much football has changed. But in his own world, where his beloved Liverpool survived Heysel and Hillsborough under his compassionate watch, Dalglish remains constant and steady. “I’ve been lucky,” he says. “I played for Celtic and Liverpool with all those great players and managers. But they were very humble and kind. It seemed not a bad idea to follow their lead.”

As Chris Coleman packed a suitcase and prepared to become Sunderland’s ninth manager in six years, his new players issued a reminder of the grisly challenge facing the former Wales coach.
Perhaps mercifully, Coleman – who will be formally “unveiled” on Monday and take charge of team affairs at Aston Villa on Tuesday – did not arrive on Wearside in time to see the club set a thoroughly unwanted record.
In failing to beat Millwall, Sunderland became the first English League side to go 20 home games without winning. They have now failed to record a victory at the Stadium of Light for almost a year and remain bottom of the Championship. Small wonder supporters’ pre-match excitement at news of a rare recruitment coup swiftly evaporated.
Coleman may not have been in the stands but, initially at least, his imminent appointment seemed to have a definite galvanising effect. Season ticket holders blinked in astonishment as the first five minutes featured the almost forgotten sight of Sunderland refusing to forfeit possession.
For a short while the watching Kit Symons – Coleman’s soon-to-be assistant here – must have been wondering if things were really quite as bad as advertised. Sunderland even took an early lead, Lewis Grabban stabbing home following a corner. Then, as home fans serenaded Millwall with rousing renditions of “How shit must you be, we’re winning at home,” reality intruded.
A key reason behind the home side’s plummet to the foot of the table is their unfortunate habit of conceding at least two goals per game. Coleman will doubtless be anxious to work on defensive positioning, concentration and body shape but arguably the biggest issue weighing down his “in-tray” is the goalkeeping dilemma.
Simon Grayson’s two summer signings in the position have both proved less than reliable, with his problems exacerbated by a destabilising tendency to rotate Robbin Ruiter and Jason Steele.
Robbie Stockdale, the caretaker manager, opted for Ruiter here but, even though Coleman was still in Winchester saying temporary goodbyes at his family home, the free transfer from FC Utrecht looked much more nervous than usual.
Faced with two routine, eminently saveable free-kicks from George Saville, Ruiter fumbled both, putting Millwall 2-1 up. The half-time whistle was greeted by resounding boos. Plus ça change.
“Thank goodness Coleman’s not here, he might have changed his mind,” muttered a fan, the inflexion in his voice suggesting he was only half joking.
By now, odd shafts of weak November afternoon sun had disappeared, dusk beckoned and an initially upbeat mood darkened. It was further depressed by the sight of Duncan Watmore, one of the team’s brighter attacking sparks, limping off clutching his knee. Watmore has only just returned to action following a cruciate ligament rupture.
The first Championship footballer to sign up to Juan Mata’s Common Goal project, whereby players pledge to donate 1% of their earnings to charity, the forward is one of the game’s good guys. He is also perceived as a rarity in a Sunderland dressing room containing some difficult-to-manage individuals. Grayson had a strong record at this level but never got the measure of potentially key but latterly seriously underachieving players, most notably Lamine Koné.
Coleman must cope without the injured Koné – a defender who, not so long ago, attracted an £18m bid from Everton – until February. By then it is thought he will have been able to invest a few million pounds on fresh January blood but it will be interesting to see if he waits that long to recruit a new goalkeeper. He would surely be well advised to scour the free-agent lists.
Then there is the Lee Cattermole question. The midfielder may remain an influential dressing room figure – previous managers disagreed on whether that was a plus or a minus – but his lack of pace debilitates the team. Grayson dropped Cattermole but Stockdale has restored him. What does Coleman do? Considering the alternatives include Darron Gibson and the £60,000-a-week Jack Rodwell, it is not a straightforward question.
Here Cattermole helped Sunderland avoid defeat by setting up Adam Matthews for a slightly flukey, goalkeeper-error-assisted, equaliser, involving the latter’s cross eluding Jordan Archer.
Whoever he names on his team sheet at Villa, Coleman’s renowned powers of communication and sheer charisma will be needed to be deployed at maximum motivational power.
Martin Bain, Sunderland’s chief executive, may have seduced the Welshman with talk of a Premier League return and near-50,000 home crowds but keeping this side out of League One may prove considerably tougher than leading Wales to a Euro 2016 semi-final. Coleman probably has cause to buy a black cat but Stockdale is not among those questioning his sanity. “It’s a tough job,” the caretaker agreed. “But it’s also a brilliant job.”


Ruby Walsh, the top jockey at the Cheltenham Festival in 11 of the last 14 seasons, faces weeks and probably months on the sidelines after suffering a broken leg in a fall at Punchestown on Saturday. Walsh had already fallen from two of his first three rides on the card when Let’s Dance, the odds-on favourite in a mares’ hurdle, fell at the fourth-last flight. The jockey received treatment on the track before being taken to Naas hospital for x-rays.
He later told Racing UK that he had “suffered a fracture of my right tibia”, adding: “I’m going to Tallaght Hospital [in Dublin] now to see a specialist, and I’ll know a lot more tomorrow.”
Walsh also appeared to receive a kick to the head from Let’s Dance as they parted company. “He got a nasty kick off his own horse when he was trying to get up,” Dr Adrian McGoldrick, the Irish Turf Club’s chief medical officer, said on Saturday. “As a matter of routine, he will be given a CT scan of that area.”
Walsh was due to partner Faugheen, the 2015 Champion Hurdle winner, in the Grade One Morgiana Hurdle at Punchestown on Sunday, the nine-year-old’s first start since January 2016. Paul Townend, Walsh’s No2 at the Willie Mullins yard, will switch from Vroum Vroum Mag, his original booking for the race, to ride Faugheen.
Faugheen is just one of a host of leading names from the Mullins stable that will need a new rider as the season unfolds, while the 38-year-old Walsh appears to face a race to be fit for the Festival, which opens on 13 March.
The Professional Jockeys’ Association estimates that the average time for a return to race-riding after fracturing a tibia is 130 days – which would keep Walsh on the sidelines until 28 March.
Tony McCoy, a close friend and former rival of Walsh and now a pundit for ITV Racing, said on Saturday evening he had exchanged a series of texts with the injured jockey. “He’s devastated,” McCoy said. “He’s had a few bad falls in the past. He’s the best jockey I’ve ever seen and tougher than anyone I’ve ever seen.
“He’s very low at the moment, but in a few days and a few weeks, he’ll be trying to get himself back. He’ll get through it. It’s a big loss to National Hunt racing to see him not riding and Willie Mullins is going to miss him, but he’ll be back.”
Rain fell throughout the second afternoon of the November meeting at Cheltenham, and every millimetre improved the chance of Splash Of Ginge in the card’s main event, the BetVictor Gold Cup.
Nigel Twiston-Davies’s nine-year-old, whose stable companion Foxtail Hill was one of the market leaders at 9-1, splashed through the mud to hold Starchitect at bay by a neck at odds of 25-1, having been available at 50-1 earlier in the day, and now has a second big-race success at long odds to add to his 33-1 success in the Betfair Hurdle in 2014.
“The soft ground is the key to him,” Twiston-Davies said, as the “Ginge Army”, led by the horse’s owner John Nield, celebrated his success in a raucous winner’s enclosure. “He’d lost his way a little bit, and it’s great to give a chance to Tom Bellamy [the winner’s jockey] who’s not having a great time. Foxtail couldn’t cope with the heavy ground, but he just bombed up to them, no trouble at all,” the trainer said.
“Being a Liverpudlian, it’s John’s ambition to win the Grand National, and he’s had a bet to win a million quid if he can win it, but we’d have to get him into the race into the race with enough of a handicap mark. He probably will, now.”
Bellamy’s first thought was for Ryan Hatch, Splash Of Ginge’s partner for much of his career, who is still recovering from injuries sustained in a fall at Cheltenham last December.
“The person sitting here today should be Ryan Hatch,” Bellamy said. “He is my best friend and I live with him. I am obviously gutted for him, but at the same time, I know he will be delighted for me.
“It’s now two wins from three rides for Nigel. It’s a big ride to get, le alone a big winner, so I’m very grateful. I lost my claim last year and it’s been very quiet since, so hopefully that might get the ball rolling a little bit now.”
Apple’s Shakira, a full sister to the excellent Apple’s Jade, is the new favourite for the Triumph Hurdle after an emphatic success in the card’s opening race, and while there are many juvenile hurdlers still waiting to make their debut over timber, it will take a very good one to shift Apple’s Shakira from the top of the market.
Gumball, a dominating winner of his first two starts over hurdles, looked like a fair opponent for Nicky Henderson’s filly on paper, but he did not jump fluently in the first half of the race and was quickly left behind when Barry Geraghty opened up on Apple’s Shakira on the turn for home. She crossed the line 17 lengths clear of Gumball and is now top-priced at 5-1 for the Triumph on 16 March.
Geraghty took the same race last year aboard the subsequent Triumph winner, Defi Du Seuil, and while Apple’s Shakira could also run in the mares’ novice hurdle at the Festival, the Triumph already appears an obvious target.
“She was green through the middle part of the race and jumped a bit big, but she kept learning as she went,” Geraghty said. “She was as much learning as responding, the penny only really dropped halfway through the race.
“She has more to learn than Defi Du Seuil, he knew his job very well. This girl has a lot of talent, but doesn’t quite know her job yet.”
Bryony Frost steered home a valuable winner for the second weekend running as Paul Nicholls’s Black Corton, the outsider of three runners, ground out victory in the card’s novice chase. Frost took the Badger Ales Trophy last Saturday on Present Man, and has now won all five of her starts on Black Corton.
Frost sent Black Corton into the lead on the turn for home, and while Twiston-Davies’s runner Ballyoptic closed on the run to the line, Black Corton held him at bay by four lengths.

Ten minutes into the second half at the Emirates Mesut Özil muscled Dele Alli off the ball on the edge of his own box, buffeted forward through the white shirts, played a perfect little combination with Aaron Ramsey and just missed out on the final scoring pass having sprinted 80 metres, carving his way across the lime green turf of a November afternoon like an elegantly high-spec German bulldozer.
It wasn’t an isolated incident. Özil was sensationally good throughout on an afternoon when Arsenal beat Tottenham 2-0 without ever really taking a punch in return. Best of all, he was good in a way he hasn’t always been, not just the incisive conductor of his best days, but a vigorous, foraging, assertive presence. At one stage in the first half Özil left Ben Davies face down in the turf with a flex of the shoulders and powered forwards only to be called back for the free-kick, leaving Özil raging and roaring at being interrupted mid-surge, like a very neat, slight Bryan Robson – Bryan Robson in a pair of spats.
Arsenal were a bit lucky at vital moments, benefiting from a couple of favourable offside calls for both goals. But the fact is they deserved to win this game for the vigour and precision of their front three alone. Özil, Alexis Sánchez and Alexandre Lacazette started just their third game here together and their first against a major Premier League power. This is not some peculiar oversight on Arsène Wenger’s part. Injuries, fatigue, motivation issues, the need for more bulk at times: these have all played a part.
Together at last, they were wonderfully convincing here on a chilly, dank north London day when the sky seemed to close in to just above the lip of the stand. Özil, Sánchez and Lacazette all made or scored a goal. Best of all, they played as a genuinely compelling unit, with speed, slick passing and real aggression.
At times in the first half Lacazette, Sánchez and Özil lined up flat, roped close together, pressurising Davinson Sánchez, who is a fine one-on-one defender but who has a slight air of panic on the ball that was also isolated by José Mourinho in the Europa League final. As Arsenal began to push Spurs back the interplay between the three was zippy and fun, intricate triangles picked out at high speed.
Özil in particular played with real swagger, using his left foot like a scalpel in between the bruising midfield collisions and repeatedly teeing up Sánchez near goal. He had a hand in the first goal too, Sánchez fouling Sánchez – just about – and Özil steepling a free-kick into the box for Shkodran Mustafi to loop a header across goal and into the top corner.
The second goal came via an excellent move down the right, with Héctor Bellerín playing a fine pass through the back three for Lacazette. His cut back was semi-controlled by Sánchez. At which point there was a glimpse of the benefits of being a power-packed little skill-goblin with feet that move at three times the speed of average flesh and bone. As Hugo Lloris and Kieran Tripper ran through heavier air, Sánchez adjusted his balance, took two rat-a-tat steps like a lightweight boxer teeing up a combination and smashed the ball into the roof of the net.
And that was pretty much that. Spurs weren’t great. Some will point to a “big game” phobia in this team, but the problem here was more specific. Dembélé-Sissoko is a brawny, powerful central midfield, all slabbed and rippling muscle at close quarters, but without the same ability to close space and read the play Harry Winks brings to those areas.
Ramsey was scragged a few times in broken play but on the ball he found space to make a pass. There must also be a little sympathy for Alli. If he doesn’t consistently dominate mature Champions League level opponents away from home aged 21 this is perhaps to be expected. In front of him Harry Kane, who has just had 13 days off, looked like a player who could do with 13 days off.
At the end of which Arsenal are a point behind Spurs and well in the race for a top-four place. There will, though, surely be one or two tremors of regret. Sánchez was cheered off at the end with real affection by the home crowd, just as Özil left the pitch to a full standing ovation with five minutes to go. Quite how many more afternoons this beautifully balanced front three might give late-Wenger Arsenal remains to be seen. A cynic might suggest that as auditions for a jackpot-hitting Bosman go, both Özil and Sánchez tailored this to perfection. Either way, on this evidence a full season from here could be quite a lot of fun to watch. Plus, of course, they will always have Spurs.


Trevor Bayliss has called on the England and Wales Cricket Board and Cricket Australia to provide more competitive tour matches in the lead up to an Ashes series after England’s final warm-up ended with just a single wicket’s reward for a brutal day in the field and a draw against untried youngsters.
England’s opposition before Thursday’s first Test has largely comprised players with little or no first-class experience and the head coach said: “Both Australia and England should be getting together and having at least one match against the A team before each series. I know when Australia go to England there are similar questions asked, that’s the way it is. From the point of view of these three games I don’t think we could have done any more. I’ve already mentioned it to [England’s director of cricket Andrew] Strauss and I will mention it to Pat Howard [Strauss’s Australian counterpart] when I see him too.”
The same problems exist when Australia tour England, although not to such an extreme extent, as they play county sides that are now usually a mix of first- and second-teamers. But Bayliss believes an official agreement should be put in place. He acknowledged that the intensity of an Ashes opener cannot be replicated, but believes both teams must be less self‑serving. “It’s not going to be perfect and nothing compares with the first Test of an Ashes away in Brisbane, where Australia haven’t lost for 30-odd years but that means they are one day closer to losing there,” he said.
Bayliss kept his counsel on Cricket Australia’s decision to allocate England training sessions only in the afternoon at the Gabba on Tuesday and Wednesday. “That was a bone of contention,” he said. “The home team makes the programme and that’s just the way it is. We will take it on the chin and get on with it. One of the games we are training in the morning the day before the game too.”


Arsène Wenger insisted he has no doubts about Mesut Özil’s and Alexis Sánchez’s commitment after Arsenal’s contract rebels played starring roles in the impressive 2-0 home victory over Tottenham Hotspur at the Emirates Stadium.
While Wenger admitted one derby win will not be enough to convince Özil and Sánchez to extend deals that expire at the end of the season, Arsenal’s manager was delighted with vigorous showings from his two best players. Özil created Shkodran Mustafi’s opening goal and Sánchez scored the second as the Gunners silenced talk of a shift in the balance of power in north London.
“I know them well and I know when these guys go on the pitch they want to win the game and they have shown that commitment again today,” Wenger said. “I never questioned their commitment. They can have bad games but the problem is when the player goes to the end of his contract, everyone says: ‘Of course.’ Their interest is to play anyway.”
However, Wenger is aware that Arsenal’s rivals are monitoring the situation with Özil and Sánchez closely. Manchester City tried to sign the Chilean in the summer and could revive their interest in January.
“The quality of the contract has to be good enough for them as well,” Wenger said. “I am convinced they love the club, they love the team.”
Wenger was asked if money is the sticking point for Sánchez and Özil. “No, it is part of it,” he said. “The whole thing has to be right, they have to be happy. I believe they love the club and want to stay but, as well, other top clubs offer good contracts.”
The Frenchman says he does not listen to his critics after a victory that took Arsenal to a point behind Tottenham. “We live inside our own club and focus on what is important for us,” Wenger said. “People have a perception of us and the game and we have to live with that. We can only give one answer and that is on the pitch.
“I have to live sometimes with opinions that are not right and opinions that are a bit exaggerated, but I can live with that. I am 35 years in the job so I know a little bit and can anticipate what happens.”
Mauricio Pochettino argued that “massive mistakes” from the referee, Mike Dean, turned the game against Tottenham. The visitors were aggrieved that Davinson Sánchez was penalised for the foul that led to Mustafi’s goal and felt the Arsenal defender was offside from the subsequent free-kick.
“Until we concede the goal the team was doing well,” Pochettino said. “We were better than them but in the end it is a massive mistake. In the end it is not one mistake, it was two mistakes. It wasn’t a foul and it was offside. It is so difficult to explain when you lose in this way. Some small details maybe are big details in football and change everything.”


These are historic times for a historic club and miserable ones for what had been a modern-day success story.
Burnley have now recorded a first hat-trick of top-flight wins since 1975 and are still level on points with Liverpool and Arsenal. In contrast, Swansea remain rooted in the relegation zone after a fifth successive defeat. Their American co-owner Steve Kaplan witnessed a wretched display, soundtracked by the 680 travelling fans calling for the chairman, Huw Jenkins, to go. While the manager Paul Clement’s job is not thought to be under immediate threat, too many more such performances will surely change that.
On and off the pitch, Swansea were architects of their own downfall. Both Burnley goals were eminently avoidable. The first, with crushing inevitability, was scored by the man they offloaded in the summer. Jack Cork’s November, which already included his England debut, duly got better. “What a couple of weeks he has had,” said his manager, Sean Dyche. “That was the business that was decided to be done,” said Clement, suggesting it was not his decision. “I like Jack a lot.”
Cork has quickly become integral at Burnley whereas Roque Mesa, the midfielder Swansea signed as he was sold, did not even make the visitors’ bench.
It was one of several instructive choices. Renato Sanches, a European Championship-winning central midfielder, was crowbarred into the team on the left wing as Clement switched to a conventional 4-4-2; he claimed it was an attacking gambit but it seemed a misguided attempt to match Burnley’s shape. The Clarets often attack on the flanks but, with Swansea undermanned in the middle, twice prospered in space in central areas.
Unlike Clement, Dyche is in a golden phase of decision-making. He preferred Ashley Barnes to Sam Vokes, the match-winner at Southampton, to deputise for the rested Chris Wood and saw the New Zealander’s understudy contribute to the first goal and score the second.
For the opener, an unmarked Cork was a catalyst in a move he completed by meeting Robbie Brady’s cross. “I love to see my midfielders driving into the box,” said Dyche. “The days of Bryan Robson flying into the box and heading it in are not as often now.”
Swansea were beaten. “When the first goal went in, belief and confidence got sucked out of the players,” Clement said. Barnes rifled in an unstoppable second. Jeff Hendrick, Barnes and Steven Defour were all denied other goals by Lukasz Fabianski. It was the first time since the opening-day victory at Chelsea that Burnley had scored more than once. They have made comparatively few goals go a long way.
Swansea have not. “Of course I am concerned,” said Clement. “I would be stupid if I wasn’t. I am concerned about our level of performance, our position in the table and the number of goals we have scored. Seven in 12 games is not enough.”
No team have had fewer efforts on target. Swansea added a solitary one to the list, a tame injury-time header from the substitute Wilfried Bony. Tammy Abraham, the scorer of 57 per cent of their league goals, was first starved of service and then taken off with a back spasm. The closest they came was courtesy of a Burnley player, Matthew Lowton’s cannonball of a volley flying past his own post.
“We are playing under our potential and I have to find a way to break this cycle,” Clement added, confident Kaplan will give him the opportunity to do that but aware of the possible consequences of a slide. “If the owners feel there is someone that can get better out of these players, it is their right to do that.”


Luck was not a commodity England enjoyed in the Stuart Lancaster era when key decisions tended to go against them and 50-50 calls in the final minutes of a close game invariably backfired, but that has changed under Eddie Jones. That is not to put their run of 21 victories in 22 matches under the Australian down to a change in fortune alone, but every successful team has it loaded in their arsenal.
There were 11 minutes to go here when Australia, who were 13-6 down despite controlling the match for long periods through their greater carrying power – without showing the composure or control needed in wet conditions – thought they had scored a try close to the posts through their wing Marika Koroibete, a hulk with gas.
They had had a try ruled out on review in the first half for offside and were behind after Elliot Daly’s try following his kick ahead on 55 minutes was allowed after the officials spent four minutes looking at the ball rolling parallel with the touchline as the Australia full-back Kurtley Beale tried to usher it out of play, before ruling that while part of it had at one point been over the line, it had never touched it – while the yellow card shown to Beale at the end of the first half for a deliberate knock-on was contentious.
All the big calls went England’s way in their record victory over Australia. The call on Daly’s try was fair but Beale’s yellow card was harsh because as he put his right hand out to intercept a pass from Jonny May, he was not so much denying England an opportunity as looking to score with the line ahead of him. The referee, Ben O’Keeffe, judged that he was not attempting to catch the ball by going for it with one hand and, while on a day when two hands were not enough for many players with a number of passes dropped in the wet, the previous week the England No8 Nathan Hughes had scored a try after reaching out for a pass with his right hand and, after a juggle, taking hold of it.
On the decision to deny Michael Hooper a try after Tevita Kuridrani’s kick to the line had been hacked on by Koroibete, who should have scored himself, Hooper was offside initially, but was behind Koroibete when he picked up and slithered over. The referee reviewed the move, but only up to the point Kuridrani kicked when Hooper was clearly offside. The law says that an offside player must not move towards opponents playing the ball or the opposition line, which he did, although cutting his speed, thinking he had played himself onside only to find the law was asinine.
O’Keeffe, a 28-year-old New Zealander who overcame a period in the first half when appearing to be losing control, initially asked the TV match official “try or no try” after Koroibete, supporting Bernard Foley’s break, had been turned on his back over the line by Chris Robshaw.
Owen Farrell complained that the replacement hooker Stephen Moore had ushered the wing over the line from an offside position, a demand that was eventually upheld, but such is the might of Koroibete that he would have got there without assistance.
It was a final taste of adversity that Australia, who were far more impressive than they were here a year ago even if they had come equipped for a dry day, could not swallow. They were still shaking their heads a couple of minutes later when Danny Care, who had just come on for Ben Youngs, chipped behind the defence for Jonathan Joseph to slide in and score.
Jones classifies his bench as finishers rather than replacements and Care showed why. He had spent 69 minutes watching England, and Australia, hang kicks into the air from their own half and keep the ball in hand in the opposition’s. The rain was not the only hazard to a running game but the referee wanted a contest at the breakdown which meant the attacking team was not allowed carte blanche.
Care kicked for Joseph in Australia’s half, taking advantage of a defence that had rushed up. Hooper’s non-try in the first half had resulted from a chip in virtually the same position and watching from the bench Care appreciated that turning on a slippery surface was tricky enough to give a chaser a head start.
The scrum-half finished off Australia with one minute to go when he put a grubber-kick into the visitors’ 22 for May to pick up and score and added the final flourish with the final move of the game after the Wallabies, as had been their habit all afternoon, lost control of the ball in the midfield.
So on a day when, for the first hour, England had been stressed enough up front for Australia to opt for a scrum when awarded a free-kick, and pinned back by the Wallabies’ four Ks – Kuridrani, Kerevi, Koroibete and Kepu – they scored four tries to none through three kicks and a turnover, mastering the conditions through guerrilla warfare while their opponents largely stuck to a gameplan that should have been watered down by the conditions.
England did to Australia what Argentina had done to them, running up quickly in defence to narrow the attack and force mistakes. A difference was that Sam Underhill had the ball in his hands twice in the opening four minutes, the number of occasions he did so in 80 against the Pumas, but he suffered a head injury on 16 minutes and, for all his virtues, it was the Wallabies who suffered because on came Maro Itoje, who went into the second row with Courtney Lawes moving to the back row.
Itoje’s troubleshooting frustrated Australia: he thwarted attacks, disrupted lineouts and provided continuity, dominating by his very presence. For all their possession, Australia did not score a point in the first half while England were fortified by two Farrell penalties. Jones afterwards bristled when the word luck was mentioned, but Foley missed a kick in front of the posts two years after landing them from everywhere here in the 2015 World Cup to mark the end of Lancaster.
England won nothing under Lancaster, but in 2012 they were denied a draw against Wales after David Strettle was denied a last-minute try after a review. It is not the case they have become a lucky side – they were smarter than Australia, more adaptable and far more clinical – but the path to the top is paved by key decisions going your way.

Roy Hodgson tried to highlight the positives, pointing to the chances Crystal Palace had created and the relative few they had conceded, and offering the visitors’ tally of fouls – 26 – as evidence of Everton’s desperation to wrest back some control. But, in the end, all that truly remained was exasperation. “I can’t ask for more than I got from the players, but I must admit to being bitterly disappointed,” he said. “I want to see points on the board.”
Palace are not performing like a side condemned to the foot of the division, with this the latest encouraging display that merited more than a mere point. They have belatedly injected some zest into their attacking play, boast pace and invention and their control of possession is less slapdash than it was. But they are still not winning games, and their leeway for dropping the odd point has gone. If Everton, such an awkward mishmash of a team, cannot be overcome, then who can?
The hosts were the more threatening team throughout, with Wilfried Zaha, Andros Townsend and Ruben Loftus-Cheek irrepressible. They eased ahead after barely 50 seconds, overcame a sense of injustice at Everton’s first equaliser to regain their lead and were even the more persuasive team after the interval. Yet the sight of Jordan Pickford pawing away efforts from Luka Milivojevic and Christian Benteke late on drew wails of frustration from the locals. This was a missed opportunity and, for all the controversy over the award of Leighton Baines’s penalty, it had been gifted to the visitors.
Palace had regained the lead courtesy of Zaha’s superbly constructed goal as the game lurched into stoppage time at the end of the first half, with Julián Speroni dummying Oumar Niasse as he controlled the ball inside his own area. His pass to Scott Dann left the captain in the lurch, Idrissa Gueye duly snapping in to force the ball free. Niasse calmly collected, advanced and slid the visitors’ second equaliser into the corner. “We committed hara-kiri,” said Hodgson. Speroni would make amends of sorts with a fine save from Dominic Calvert‑Lewin after the break, but the sense of deflation at half-time was palpable.
The penalty award, too, had grated. Niasse had been in Palace’s Soho offices on transfer deadline day after terms had effectively been agreed with Everton over an £8m move, only for the plug to be pulled just before the cut-off. Here he was a nuisance with a point to prove, wriggling away from Dann five minutes in and apparently sensing the centre-half might dangle a leg en route. There was no trip forthcoming – the contact was between centre-half’s shoulder and striker’s chest, though it was hardly forceful – but the referee, Anthony Taylor, was still convinced enough by the crumple to award the spot-kick.
“It was a long way away, but it looked like there was contact,” said David Unsworth. “But what I would say is Oumar will always take on an opportunity. If he’s got clipped or pushed …”
Baines scored and Hodgson was still complaining to the fourth official when the second half kicked off, but he recognised his team should have prospered regardless. They had led initially through James McArthur’s volley, the Scot pouncing after Pickford pushed out Loftus-Cheek’s shot. Zaha’s second, converted from Joel Ward’s wonderful centre, would have had him purring, but other opportunities did not yield reward. The winner they craved never came.
Instead it was Unsworth who was thumping his chest in pride at the end, the caretaker still desperate to make this position his own on a full-time basis. “If I get the job, I’ll be delighted,” he said. “But whoever gets the job, I’ll shake them by the hand and wish them the best. What will be will be.”
His team were fortunate, the rather disjointed nature of their squad all too apparent. But they are in a far healthier position than their hosts.


Eddie Howe praised the resilience of Callum Wilson after the injury-plagued striker hit a fine hat-trick in 10-man Bournemouth’s crushing win against Huddersfield.
Wilson was sidelined for nine months by serious knee ligament damage suffered in January, having recovered from a similar problem sustained in September 2015. He put Bournemouth on course for victory with a quickfire double at the Vitality Stadium before completing his treble late on following the sending-off of the home captain, Simon Francis, and a strike from Harry Arter. The goals were Wilson’s first in the Premier League since the second knee operation and his second top-flight treble after his hat-trick in a 4-3 victory at West Ham a month before the first injury.
Howe said: “I’ve been there myself in the respect you get a serious injury, it’s a lonely place, it’s a hard place to come back from. Especially when you consider for Callum he’d just scored a hat-trick in the Premier League, in his first taste of the Premier League. It looked like he had the world at his feet and it changed in an instant. Through that period he always maintained his enthusiasm, his positivity, he’s always a good person to engage with and see. And he’s worked incredibly hard on his body to make sure he comes back in the shape that he has, so full credit to him. The quality of his finishes for the goals was really, really high so it’s been a really good night for him.”
Huddersfield’s David Wagner criticised the officials and felt they made mistakes that turned the game in Bournemouth’s favour. The Terriers had been the better team in the opening stages but they fell behind when Wilson headed home Jordon Ibe’s corner moments after a strong challenge by Charlie Daniels on Florent Hadergjonaj went unpunished by the referee, Lee Probert. Wilson was then possibly marginally offside for Bournemouth’s second.
“When we speak about a 2-0 half-time result against us, [it is] after two referee’s decisions which are not correct,” Wagner said. “For the first corner, it was a clear harsh tackle. It was maybe more than a yellow card in this moment and we concede a corner where they scored the first one and before the second goal it was a yard offside after a free-kick, so this is the referee’s job to see this. This wasn’t difficult to see because it was a set play.
“Unfortunately, from my point of view, it wasn’t correct and this is what we have to accept. These two goals changed the game completely and then in the second half we have not created enough.”
Wilson had the final say when he drilled in his third goal six minutes from time after Josh King’s pull-back.


Mohamed Salah has become known as “The King of Egypt” around Melwood since securing his country’s first World Cup appearance in 28 years. He has quickly established a regal presence at club level too. Liverpool’s £36.9m summer signing struck another two goals as Southampton were comprehensively outclassed.
Salah followed up a two-goal display at West Ham United before the international break with two more to take his place as the Premier League’s leading goalscorer. He was signed from Roma with speed and creativity in mind but he has exceeded expectations with 14 goals in 18 games in all competitions for his new, grateful club. Nine goals in his first 12 Premier League outings for Liverpool has also set a club record. And to think the former Chelsea winger’s finishing was subject to legitimate criticism earlier in the season.
“Mo is in a good moment,” said an understated Jürgen Klopp. “That is good for us. The first one was not a real chance from that position, I would say. It was a fantastic goal. The second goal was fantastic play.
“It was an all-round good performance and also very important. We have pushed the top of the table together and that is really good. [Manchester] City are flying and pretty much alone. We cannot change that but we can make pressure on the others and we will do that.”
Salah departed to a deserved standing ovation in the 80th minute and into an embrace from Klopp as he savoured his first league win over Southampton, at the fifth attempt, and a victory that moved Liverpool to within a point of Tottenham Hotspur in fourth. Philippe Coutinho provided the final flourish but Salah was the game‑changer.
Southampton did not set out merely to absorb pressure and avoid a serious beating. They were just made to look that way as Liverpool controlled possession and gradually weakened a well-organised defence with the quality of their distribution and movement. That said, the manner of Liverpool’s breakthrough was galling for a manager of Mauricio Pellegrino’s defensive pedigree. One win in seven matches is a worry, he admitted, and that sequence was never in doubt from the moment Dusan Tadic committed a cardinal sin on the edge of his penalty area.
Liverpool had dominated but created few clear openings when Virgil van Dijk headed a Jordan Henderson corner out to the Serbian winger. Tadic had space and opportunity to stretch the hosts. Instead, he ran across his area where three Liverpool players were lurking, with predictable results. Roberto Firmino dispossessed Tadic, Georginio Wijnaldum picked out Salah free on the right and the forward swept a stunning, angled finish beyond Fraser Forster from 20 yards. A gift brilliantly accepted.
“You need these moments,” Klopp said. “We have not had them too often this season. We all know what it has been like after 50, 60 minutes here without a goal. It could be the same performance but you need these goals and thank God we scored them. That makes all the difference.”
Salah’s second arrived courtesy of a truly exquisite ball into the area from Coutinho. There appeared little on for the Brazilian when he received Henderson’s pass 30 yards from the Southampton goal. But he spotted Salah’s run behind Wesley Hoedt and slipped the ball perfectly into his stride. Salah turned a first time shot past Forster with Southampton defenders appealing for offside, more in hope than expectation.
The visitors threatened little and a brief second-half surge was quashed by a Liverpool defence featuring impressive performances from Trent Alexander-Arnold and Dejan Lovren. Salah almost created a third for Alberto Moreno but his through ball got caught underneath the rampaging left-back, who missed the birth of his son, Alberto Junior, on Friday night to prepare for the game.
The pass that eventually delivered Liverpool’s third was, like Coutinho’s, an inspirational touch. Sadio Mané removed two defenders from the equation with a brilliant reverse ball into the unmarked Roberto Firmino. His shot cannoned off Forster and into the path of Coutinho who steered the ball home from 12 yards.


It is hard to believe now that Manchester City lost this fixture 4-2 a year ago, putting in a shambolic performance that fatally undermined any pretensions they might have had of a title challenge.
They arrived here 18 points ahead of the Foxes and deservedly increased the gap to 21 with an impressive display of control, even with two centre-halves who were rusty through lack of games. Leicester City did not play badly; they might have taken something from the game against most opponents, but the whole point about Manchester City these days is that they are not any old opponents.
This was their 10th league win in a row, their 16th of an all-competition sequence, and it could have been even more emphatic, with Leroy Sané in particular finding space and running past defenders at will.
When Pep Guardiola the perfectionist puts together his weekly mistake compilation for training-ground analysis, he will probably point to a couple of occasions in the second half when his side were grateful to see offside flags raised against Jamie Vardy, but will mostly be wanting to know why his forwards did not finish with the sort of precision they showed in their buildups.
“We scored two amazing goals, but we created a lot more promising situations,” Guardiola said. “We could still be a little better in the final action.”
Making his first start in more than two months, Vincent Kompany was nearly in trouble after a couple of minutes for a professional foul on Vardy. A delicately weighted pass from Vicente Iborra hit Vardy’s stride before Kompany had recognised the danger and all the defender could do was bring down the Leicester striker before he raced into the penalty area. The home supporters clearly felt Graham Scott took the easy option in producing just a yellow card, for, although it was hardly the clearest of goalscoring opportunities, it was just the sort of chance Vardy thrives on. “Kompany was the last man and it should have been a red card,” Claude Puel said. “That could have changed the face of the game.”
The first real goal chance of the afternoon arrived midway through the first half when Kasper Schmeichel had to be alert to tip a David Silva shot over his bar. The visitors had been stroking the ball around expansively without managing to find Gabriel Jesus on the end of any of their approach work, but when Fabian Delph played Sané into space on the left, his cut-back brought a first-time shot on target from David Silva.
A Manchester City backline already missing the suspended Nicolás Otamendi was further depleted on the half-hour when John Stones suffered a hamstring injury that will keep him out for a month. The England defender pulled up in pain after chasing the elusive Demarai Gray and was replaced by Eliaquim Mangala, making his second league appearance of the season. While Guardiola said he had no problem with Gareth Southgate playing Stones in both of England’s recent friendlies, he was the one who mentioned it.
Guardiola was worried about the pace in Leicester’s frontline even before he lost both his first-choice central defenders, so a goal on the stroke of the interval must have come as a relief. The visitors had been threatening to score for a while, with David Silva shooting over and Sané bringing a save from Schmeichel, and the only surprise about the opening goal was the identity of its scorer. Jesus had been having such an unproductive afternoon it was easy to forget he was on the pitch, but he popped up in exactly the right place, as goalscorers often will, to complete a prolonged passing move with a tap-in. David Silva could probably have scored on his own after Raheem Sterling played a one-two with Kevin De Bruyne and left him with only Schmeichel to beat; instead, he opted to make sure, aware that Jesus was up in support to his right.
Manchester City underlined their superiority with a goal of similar quality at the start of the second half, though one had to feel slightly sorry for Leicester, who effectively began the move when Harry Maguire saw a shot come back off a post. The hugely impressive Fernandinho moved the play swiftly upfield to De Bruyne, who accepted a return pass from Sané before shuffling the ball to his left foot to beat Schmeichel with a glorious rising drive from outside the area.
There were no more goals after that, although there could have been. Perhaps Manchester City are not yet as clinical as they would like to be, but towards the end of the game, when Maguire was eventually booked for fouling Sterling twice in the same move at either end of the pitch, you could tell Leicester had had enough of being run ragged. Normally one of the most energetic teams, they just wanted the match to be over.
While this draining effect on opponents might be nothing new for Guardiola, it is a significant, not to say ominous, development for opponents of Manchester City.


There was always a more than even chance that the affair nicknamed Jiffy bag-gate would never arrive at a definitive ending. The investigating UK Anti-Doping agency has limited powers, the events in question hark back five years and more into the past, the allegations were vague – that triamcinolone had been in a certain bag delivered at a certain time to be administered to Bradley Wiggins, who has stated via Instagram that the bag “was never delivered to me” – and the key witness, Dr Richard Freeman, appeared unwilling to engage fully with the inquiry.
As a result, Wednesday’s statement from Ukad confirming that no charges would be brought against any of the parties involved because the contents of the bag could not be defined one way or the other prompted little more than a resigned shrug of the shoulders in many quarters. Wiggins and Team Sky have consistently stated that there was no wrongdoing on their part and both have stated that the verdict backs this up; their critics feel that a lack of definitive evidence is just that.
For all the lengthy wait, Ukad’s timing was apposite in one sense; on Sunday the BBC is to show a documentary – Britain’s Cycling Superheroes, the Price of Success? – relating events in the background to the Jiffy bag affair: the therapeutic use exemptions accorded to Wiggins in the run-in to the 2011 and 2012 Tours de France and the 2013 Giro d’Italia so he could use the corticosteroid triamcinolone to treat a pollen allergy and the allegations of sexism and inappropriate comments that ended Shane Sutton’s tenure as technical director at British Cycling. (Here I should declare an interest: I was interviewed at some length for the documentary, for which I received a fee).
The Jiffy bag story acts as a coda to the governing body’s annus horribilis, but although the Ukad inquiry ended up going nowhere, its true significance is less the package per se, more its place as the starting point to a chain of revelations and questions. The wild card was the interest of the MPs on parliament’s culture, media and sport committee, led by Damian Collins, and their decision to link the affair to their hearings into doping in sport, making parts of Ukad’s investigation very public.
As well as detailed questioning of Sir Dave Brailsford and Sutton – which served to highlight the inadequacies of the explanations proffered for the delivery – by interlocutors who could not be dismissed with a “no comment” or merely the assertion that “we do it right” – which served to highlight the inadequacies of the explanations proffered for the delivery – the hearings provided the critical piece of information, courtesy of the Ukad head Nicole Sapstead, that a quantity of triamcinolone had been acquired on behalf of Team Sky, between 2010-2013, that was far in excess of what would have been needed for Wiggins’s three TUEs: 55 doses, the team confirmed.
The salient questions relate to the triamcinolone: what was it used for, for whom was it all intended and why was it ordered in? In a written answer to Collins’s committee Team Sky could account for 10 doses, suggesting that the rest may have been destined for Dr Freeman’s private practice. Writing to Collins’s committee, Dr Freeman stated that he had administered triamcinolone to only one rider at Team Sky and British Cycling.
The mystery remains. Also hanging is the question raised in a whistleblower’s letter that formed part of the inquiry, as to whether there had been a change in philosophy at Team Sky late in 2010, leading the team to begin using legal injections for “recovery”, until the practice was banned in May 2011.
Where now? For Ukad, Collins’s committee should recommend an increased budget and greater powers based on making doping and/or the administration of doping products a criminal offence.
For Team Sky, meanwhile, there is a reputation to be rebuilt – as Brailsford will remain at the team it has to be a priority. It would be a relatively simple step to join the Movement for Credible Cycling, the voluntary body that campaigns against the use of cortisone and tramadol in competition; it would be an answer to the team’s many critics and a major boost to the MPCC. The direction of travel is towards tighter limits on both products, so why not be ahead of the game?
Sky could go one step further and announce that they will make any future TUEs public subject to certain limits on privacy if (as is highly unlikely) the medicines were to relate to non-sporting areas such as mental or sexual issues. They could publish an annual audit of tramadol use, given that – according to their written answer to Collins – its use in the team is currently minimal and related only to serious injury.
These things could be written into riders’ contracts, would imply that something has been learned from the past 12 months and would enable the team and Brailsford to move forwards. It is just under a year since he told Collins and his committee that a new spirit of openness would become his team’s hallmark as a result of the lessons learned and the world of cycling is still waiting for a move in that direction.


The message was loud and clear as the home supporters spelt out to Guochuan Lai, the club’s Chinese owner, exactly what they think of Tony Pulis. Anger and frustration has been bubbling away here for a while, yet this was the afternoon when patience finally snapped. “We want Pulis out,” was chanted repeatedly by a fanbase that is no longer willing to tolerate the sight of him in charge of a team in freefall.
“You’re getting sacked in the morning” and “Tony Pulis, your football is shit” also reverberated as Chelsea brutally exposed the brittle confidence in a side that has now won two of their past 21 Premier League matches and collected 12 points in the process. It is relegation form and Pulis appears powerless to arrest the slide.
Lai had scheduled this visit around six weeks ago but it could not have been more timely and it was tempting to wonder what was going through his mind as he watched such a listless performance on the pitch and listened to the scathing criticism of Pulis from the stands. Pulis’s position felt untenable come the end and the 59-year-old sounded like a man who is resigned to his fate when he attended the post-match press conference,
The empty seats before the game told a story – faith was lost in these parts a long time ago – and so did the sight of many others leaving with 27 minutes remaining. Eden Hazard had just scored his second and Chelsea’s fourth as they coasted to a fourth successive Premier League victory.
This had turned into an exercise in damage limitation for Albion long before half-time. Chelsea were 3-0 up after only 38 minutes and, as well as the Premier League champions played at times, it was alarming to see a team managed by Pulis defending so shambolically. There was so much time and space for Chelsea to exploit and the visitors were not going to pass up the opportunity.
Álvaro Morata continued his excellent start to the season, netting Chelsea’s first from close range and setting up the second for Hazard, taking his tally to eight goals and four assists in the league. Marcos Alonso then scored Chelsea’s third, taking advantage of some appalling marking from a set-piece, before Hazard added the goal that reflected the gulf in quality between the two sides.
Antonio Conte will have few easier afternoons in the dugout. “The game became easy because we started very well,” said Chelsea’s manager, who senses that his team are finding some form. “Last season we won 13 games in a row and I must be honest, in this league it’s not simple to have this type of run, because every game you have to play with great concentration. But four wins in a row is important for us and our confidence. We started this season with many problems but we are trying slowly to find the right solution.”
Morata certainly seems like the answer up front. The Spaniard’s opening goal was routine enough but it was an exquisite flick he produced from Cesc Fàbregas’s pass to set Hazard free for Chelsea’s second. Hazard rounded Ben Foster with the minimum of fuss, rolled the ball into the empty net and already, with 23 minutes gone, it felt like there was no way back for Albion.
That feeling was reinforced when Alonso added the third. Fàbregas, who was involved in three of Chelsea’s four goals, delivered a free-kick from wide on the left and it is no exaggeration to say that there was no defender within five yards of Alonso, who volleyed high into the roof of the net with the angle against him at the far post.
Toothless up front, overrun in midfield and wide open at the back, Albion were all over the place and it was no surprise when Chelsea grabbed a fourth. Fàbregas’s fine lofted pass released Hazard in behind and the Belgian twisted away from Ahmed Hegazi before dispatching a low shot into the bottom corner. The game was up for Albion. And it surely is for Pulis, too.


Wales denied any accusations of cheating after Georgia came within a whisker of causing a huge upset in Cardiff.
Warren Gatland’s side eventually held on for a win, but – with the Wales replacement prop Tomas Francis sent to the sin-bin late on – Georgia were denied their best opportunity to level the scores when the referee Mathieu Raynal called for uncontested scrums in the game’s final play.
Given the fact the Welsh set piece had been on toast throughout the previous 79 minutes, it was to prove a lucky reprieve for the hosts as they survived to avoid a real embarrassment.
Passive set pieces came about because of Francis’s yellow card and Wales claimed their starting props, Nicky Smith and Leon Brown, were not fit to return to the field.
Gatland said: “We were as confused as anyone. Leon had cramped up, his calves were no good. He came off as a tactical replacement but we knew he was cramping up a little bit. Nicky had a calf problem too. The scrums would have been uncontested anyway if he had come on, but there wasn’t anything from us trying to manipulate the laws.
“If Leon had been fit, he would have definitely gone back on the field. The question was asked at the end whether the props were fit to go on, but they weren’t.”
Wales managed a first-half try from the Dragons wing Hallam Amos but that was as good as it got for the home side, who were in shocking form after the break.
Georgia nearly stole what would have been an astonishing draw and their coach, Milton Haig, insisted his team would have done so had they been allowed to scrummage properly.
“I’m confident we would have got the win if it hadn’t been uncontested scrums,” he said. “But their props couldn’t go back on. There is a disciplinary process for things like this but I’m not too interested in taking it further. That’s not my style.”
Georgia may not win any awards for entertainment but not even the most ardent sceptic could argue against the effectiveness of their pack of forwards or their scrum dominance.
The revitalised Rhys Priestland put in an assured performance, kicking eight points and he looked the most likely player to unlock the Georgian defence. It was the Bath fly-half who was the architect of the hosts’ first try when, following a driving lineout from five metres out, the ball was spread wide. Priestland combined with Scott Williams to put Amos over in the corner.
Wales had two tries ruled out when Alex Cuthbert was held up over the line and Smith was adjudicated to have knocked on while stripping the ball, to deny Amos what would have been his second. The most Georgia could muster in an underwhelming first 40 minutes was a penalty from the full-back Ioseb Matiashvili.
Wales’s inability to put Georgia to the sword in the first half turned the game into a dogfight. Georgia had initially struggled to cope with Wales’s pace and tempo, but their much-vaunted scrum started to take control, forcing props Smith and Leon Brown to concede penalties. It allowed Matiashvili to narrow the gap to 10-6.
The second half was right up the visitors’ street. First, Priestland cancelled out Matiashvili’s three points with a penalty of his own after the Georgians had infringed at the ruck.
But the Georgia scrum had Wales by the scruff of the neck as the game approached full time, with the visitors pushing for a penalty try from five metres out. Francis did his best to throw the game away when he was sent to the sin-bin a minute into stoppage time for needlessly coming in from the side – before uncontested scrums saved Wales’s blushes.
“It wasn’t the prettiest game but a win is a win,” said the captain, Dan Lydiate. “The fans want to see tries and we want to play a brand of rugby that’s entertaining, but I would have taken that result before the game.”

Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones has apologized after a gossip website posted a four-year-old video of him making a racially insensitive comment.
The Blast website reported the video was shot in 2013 at a Dallas hotel by a white man who asked Jones if he would tape a message for his fiancee. Jones appeared to be joking when he said, “Hey, Jennifer, congratulations on the wedding. Now, you know he’s with a black girl tonight, don’t you?”
After the video’s release Friday, Jones apologized in a statement issued by the team, saying, “That comment was inappropriate. It’s not who I am, and I’m sorry.”
The website reported the video was shared by someone who thought it was relevant in light of players sitting or kneeling in protest during the national anthem in the NFL. Former San Francisco quarterback Colin Kaepernick started the protests last year to bring awareness to issues of racial inequality.
Jones has been outspoken in his view that players should stand during the anthem, at one point saying he would bench any player who disrespected the flag.
The apology came at the end of the week that’s seen Jones feature prominently in the headlines over mounting tensions with NFL commissioner Roger Goodell.
The Associated Press obtained a letter sent by the NFL to Jones’ attorney accusing the Cowboys owner of “conduct detrimental to the league’s best interests” over his objection to a contract extension for Goodell.
The letter accusing Jones of sabotaging the negotiations was sent to David Boies on Wednesday. Jones hired Boies and threatened to sue the NFL if Goodell’s contract extension was approved by the compensation committee, made up of six owners. All 32 owners voted unanimously in May to let the committee finalize a deal with Goodell.
The letter, first reported by the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal, was written by outside counsel for the compensation committee and given to the AP by a person who requested anonymity because it was not intended to be made public.
It’s the latest escalation of a feud between the NFL and one of its most powerful owners. Jones has denied that his objections to the extension are tied to Goodell’s decision to suspend star running back Ezekiel Elliott for six games over alleged domestic violence.
Elliott abandoned his legal fight over the suspension Wednesday. He has five games left to serve.
“Your client’s antics, whatever their motivation, are damaging the league and reflect conduct detrimental to the league’s best interests,” the letter said.
Jones has said he has issues with compensation in the deal, along with concerns about the escalation of player protests involving the national anthem and how the league has handled them. He also has suggested that owners should revisit the power that the position wields.
The letter confirmed that Jones was removed as a non-voting member of the compensation committee after threatening to sue.
Jones, who was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in August, was accused of sharing with all the owners an outdated document related to the negotiations with Goodell.
“Someone who is genuinely concerned ‘that the owners know the truth about the negotiations’ would not deliberately distribute such an outdated document, particularly when he has in his possession drafts that are current and accurately reflect the actual state of negotiations, or threaten to sue the league and its owners if he does not get his way,” the letter said.
Jones has acknowledged being at odds with the compensation committee chairman, Atlanta owner Arthur Blank, over the Goodell talks. They didn’t speak on the field before the Falcons’ 27-7 victory over the Cowboys on Sunday.
Blank issued a statement Monday saying the committee planned to proceed with finalizing the Goodell deal and would keep other owners updated.
A spokesman for Jones didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.
Jones claimed Tuesday on his radio show that “well over half” the owners agree with him in wanting a final vote after the committee is finished negotiating the deal.
“With due respect, we urge Mr Jones to drop his misguided litigation threats and media campaign to undermine the committee’s mandate,” the letter said. “And we urge Mr. Jones to support the committee’s deliberations, not attempt to sabotage them.”


The Rangers caretaker manager Graeme Murty claimed he could not afford to think about his own prospects after Hamilton secured their first league victory at Ibrox since 1926.
Murty was given the chance to claim a third consecutive victory, but second-half goals from the former Rangers winger David Templeton and Darren Lyon consigned his men to a 2-0 home defeat.
Rangers previously declared they would draw up a shortlist after this week, but Murty would not comment on whether the Premiership defeat would harm his chances. “It will or it won’t,” he said. “I can’t really have a thought about that. That’s just noise around our performance.
“What we managed to do is get the players focused and ready for the performance. The performance didn’t give us the three points. That’s all I can worry about and I’m going to look on Monday and make sure, if I’m in post, the players learn the lessons from this and that they get a good week’s training and go and put things right.”
Alfredo Morelos missed a string of chances as he extended his goal drought to nine matches, and Templeton opened the scoring after Ross McCrorie’s misplaced pass two minutes into the second half. Lyon scored on the break with 10 minutes remaining and even then Rangers missed a series of chances, with the majority of the home support gone by the time Accies defender Alex Gogic received a second yellow card in stoppage-time.
The 2-0 victory was Hamilton’s first win against Rangers since Adrian Sprott scored a famous cup winner at Ibrox 30 years ago.
A superb second-half free-kick by Leigh Griffiths was enough for Celtic to extend their own British unbeaten domestic record to 64 games.
The Scottish Premiership leaders found Ross County difficult to break down and after the hour mark Griffiths came on for Jonny Hayes and got his opportunity from a free-kick in 77 minutes, he curled it trademark style past the home keeper, Aaron McCarey, to give Celtic a narrow win and set them up for the Champions League game against Paris Saint-Germain in France on Wednesday.
Rodgers said: “It was a brilliant goal. The free-kick must have been nearly 30 yards and to get it up and over with that speed and into the corner was amazing. And it was going to take something like that.”
The goal allowed the treble-winners to relax and Olivier Ntcham, on for Dembélé, cracked the post with a drive from the edge of the box. Scott Sinclair missed the target with a good chance before the end with a County claim for handball against Dedryck Boyata in the Celtic box ignored.
Rodgers said: “You are never going to be at your fluent best all the time but mentally we are very strong.”
Steven MacLean sealed a first victory in seven matches for St Johnstone with an injury-time winner in a sensational finish to their match with Hibs.
Murray Davidson’s 74th-minute header for the visitors was cancelled out by Anthony Stokes’s controversial penalty in stoppage time, but MacLean struck with the final kick of the game to earn a 2-1 win for Tommy Wright’s team.
The Motherwell striker Louis Moult scored twice as the visitors secured a 2-0 win at Pittodrie.
Moult, a summer transfer target for Aberdeen, scored either side of half-time and he came closest to scoring in the final quarter of the match, failing with an opportunity for a hat-trick, when his 25-yard free-kick cleared the crossbar. The result will provide Motherwell with a fillip for next Sunday’s League Cup final against Celtic. Ten-man Dundee halted their bad run, holding on for a goalless draw with Kilmarnock at Dens Park.
Neil McCann’s side were forced to hang on for the remaining five minutes after Darren O’Dea was sent off by Willie Collum for a second yellow-card offence.
The Taysiders at least prevented a sixth straight league defeat by digging deep when tested to halt their recent slump, although they had to rely on the crossbar to save them from Gordon Greer’s header. Dundee remain bottom while Steve Clarke’s side are now undefeated in their past four away matches.
The Highland League sides Formartine United, Cove Rangers, Brora Rangers and Fraserburgh all progressed to the Scottish Cup fourth round.
Three League One sides were knocked out with Brora beating Stranraer 1-0, Cove Rangers winning 3-2 at Airdrie and Formartine defeating Forfar 1-0. Fraserborough beat Lowland side Spartans 2-1.
St Mirren, the Championship leaders, thrashed Lothian Thistle Hutchison Vale 7-1 with all their goals coming in the first half. The former Hearts midfielder Gavin Reilly scored four, with Lewis Morgan, Jack Baird and Cammy Smith also scoring for the visitors and Sean Wringe striking the hosts’ sole reply. The draw for the fourth round takes place on Monday.


The noisy neighbours have been put in their place for now. By the time Harry Kane and Dele Alli trudged off the pitch in the dying stages, with the triumphant taunts from the home fans ringing in their ears, Tottenham Hotspur had long let go of the notion of offering swaggering proof of where the balance of power in north London lies these days. Instead, it was an afternoon of pure release for Arsène Wenger, who took great joy from a first derby win over Mauricio Pochettino and a performance that reminded Arsenal of better times.
There could be no dispute about Arsenal’s ownership of the local bragging rights, earned thanks to goals from Shkodran Mustafi and Alexis Sánchez in the first half, not to mention a blend of defensive resilience and midfield resilience not always associated with this team of late. The only frustration for Wenger was that his players do not produce this much class and poise more consistently.
Arsenal’s first victory over a fellow big six member this season was assured long before the final whistle and it took them to within a point of Tottenham, whose title hopes are fading after a strangely muted failure to rise to the occasion. For all that Pochettino preferred to focus on the officiating, from the award of the free-kick that led to Mustafi’s opener to the failure to spot that the German was marginally offside from Mesut Özil’s subsequent delivery, to Granit Xhaka escaping with a booking for a clumsy early foul on Alli, questions over his young team’s mentality will persist until they win this type of game. The disappointment was even more bitter than when they faltered at Old Trafford a month ago.
It was certainly unusual to be at this fixture and detect early foreboding in the home sections, where there was queasiness at the thought of Tottenham jabbing at the soft underbelly of late-era Wengerball. To appreciate the shifting dynamics in this corner of the capital, one only had to glance at the teams’ midweek assignments in Germany: while Arsenal, demoted to the Europa League, visit the Bundesliga stragglers Köln on Thursday, Tottenham can clinch top spot in their Champions League group at Borussia Dortmund two nights earlier.
Yet the idea that they could ever be underdogs against these opponents compelled Arsenal to tear up the narrative. The atmosphere was noisy and intimidating and the home side offered the impression that they had something to prove after an underwhelming start to the season. They pressed Tottenham urgently and Alexandre Lacazette had an early sighter after Eric Dier dithered in possession.
Lacazette, starting with Sánchez and Mesut Özil for the third time in the league, was a sprightly opponent for the Tottenham defence. The striker hurried Hugo Lloris into a panicked clearance, almost converted Héctor Bellerín’s low centre after a fine pass from the impressive Aaron Ramsey and sparked jubilant scenes when he set up Sánchez for Arsenal’s second goal.
It was an uneven offering from Tottenham. Toby Alderweireld was missed in defence, Kane wore strapping on his right leg, Alli did not look fully fit after missing England duty and Harry Winks was ready only for a place on the bench, meaning that the visitors lacked control in midfield. Moussa Sissoko was careless in possession and Mousa Dembélé struggled with Arsenal’s tempo.
Tottenham did have their moments before Mustafi’s controversial opener. There was danger whenever Christian Eriksen found pockets of space behind Ramsey and Xhaka and Kane operated a shoot-on-sight policy.
However, Petr Cech foiled Kane on two occasions, most notably when the striker broke down the left following miscommunication between Laurent Koscielny and Mustafi while Arsenal’s back three contained Alli. Eriksen clipped Cech’s right post with a low shot, but Arsenal’s football was silkier.
The game turned on a couple of tight decisions. First, Mike Dean penalised Davinson Sánchez when the Colombian tried to tackle his namesake in red and white. Özil floated the free-kick to the far post from the left, the flag stayed down and Mustafi escaped Jan Vertonghen to send a looping header beyond Lloris, the ball going in off the inside of the right post almost in slow motion.
Tottenham’s response was torpor, enabling Arsenal to tear into them. Lacazette’s elusive movement took him beyond Tottenham’s high line after a clever pass from Bellerín and his ball found Sánchez, who crashed a high shot past Lloris despite a heavy first touch.
Jesús Pérez, Pochettino’s No2, remonstrated with Dean at the interval, but the main worry for Tottenham was how Arsenal’s greater energy in midfield allowed the attacking triumvirate of Lacazette, Özil and Sánchez to flourish. Sánchez had his most productive game of the season and Özil earned a standing ovation. Wenger praised his two contract rebels.
Arsenal could not entirely relax with a 2-0 lead. Tottenham sought a riposte and Mustafi had to make a superb block when Eriksen released Kane, while Cech made a late save from Dier’s header.
Yet Arsenal held out with surprising comfort. Pochettino introduced Fernando Llorente and Son Heung-min, but Tottenham never looked capable of mounting a heroic comeback. Arsenal relished silencing talk of a power shift.


When Britt Assombalonga runs out on to the Elland Road pitch on Sunday lunchtime his thoughts may well stray, momentarily, to the past, to the sacrifices his parents made in helping him become Middlesbrough’s record £15m signing.
“I thank my mum and dad every day,” he says. “I think about them a lot. They gave us a better life and a good education in the UK and worked so hard when we were growing up that they didn’t see too much of each other.”
Assombalonga is casting his mind back to 1995 when, aged two, he joined his brother and two sisters in boarding a Paris-bound flight from Kinshasa, capital of their native Democratic Republic of Congo. A country dubbed “Africa’s bleeding heart” was on the brink of civil war and their parents, Beatrice and Fedor, wanted the children to belong to a different world.
A Channel crossing later they had swapped life in Kinshasa, where Fedor was a professional footballer, for London’s St John’s Wood and jobs at Abbey Road Studios. That may sound a decent exchange, but the couple were cleaners, Fedor working the day shift and Beatrice nights.
The pair were on low incomes and often struggled to buy food. Their home was on the nearby Rowley Way council estate which, these days, is a grade two listed development where ex-local authority two-bedroom flats can sell for more than £500,000, but back then was not quite so upmarket.
“It was very hard for mum and dad, I’m so proud of them, when they first came they only spoke Lingala and French but they wanted to give us chances they never had,” says Assombalonga, as he sits in the corner of a quiet dressing room at Middlesbrough’s attractive training ground in the undulating parkland near Darlington. “They’ve made this possible for me but it wasn’t easy. My dad was a striker, like me, but he gave it up to bring us here.”
It took time to convince the authorities to let them stay long-term. “In year eight at school there was a trip to Disneyland but my mum explained I didn’t have a British passport,” says Assombalonga. “I was so proud when I got one in year nine.”
Now 24, he left school with several grade A GCSEs but postponed plans to become a lawyer when Watford spotted the football talent honed by playing frequent five-a-side in Camden’s urban football cages.
A professional contract beckoned with Assombalonga leaving Vicarage Road to become Peterborough’s record £1.5m signing. When he joined Nottingham Forest in another club record transfer, £5.5m this time, a pattern was emerging.
This upward trajectory was interrupted when his studs caught in the turf and a ruptured patella required a complex repair involving a hamstring graft followed by 14 long months of rehabilitation. Fourteen goals in 32 appearances for Forest last season not only confirmed his faith in the rebuilt knee but provoked a summer move for £15m to Teesside.
The price tag does not seem to be weighing heavily on what must be among the broadest shoulders in the Championship. “No pressure,” says Assombalonga, smiling. “Well, maybe I felt it on the first day here but, after that, it’s just been like everywhere else. I’m getting used to being my clubs’ record signing.”
His tally of eight goals in 16 appearances this term is more impressive than many of Boro’s performances but a run of three wins has reignited promotion optimism. Another victory at Leeds would further vindicate manager Garry Monk’s close-season decision to leave Elland Road for the Riverside and a £50m squad overhaul.
“We’re quite confident we’re on the way up,” says Assombalonga. “It’s taken a little bit of time but I think we’re clicking. We’re getting the balance between attack and defence right and trusting the manager.
“Garry’s a really good communicator and this is a great dressing room. You want to come in every morning, just to see everyone.”
Although Assombalonga complains about the weather – “I’m still adjusting, it’s a lot colder than London”– he has no regrets about relocating his partner, Laura, and toddler daughter, Amiyah, to Teesside. “I’m really enjoying it,” he says. “I love the place, it’s a really nice area.”
Last November, he flew into Kinshasa on his first return to the DRC. An international call-up offered a prospective debut against Guinea but problems with paperwork ensured it never happened, leaving the door ajar for a potential England summons. “We’ll see what the future holds,” he says. “But it was very touching to go back to my roots. To finally see what my birthplace is really like.”
As Assombalonga talks intelligently about Joseph Kabila, the DRC’s controversial president, it is easy to envisage his muscular bulk repackaged into a lawyer’s suit but such ambitions can wait. Right now, there are goals to be scored and promotion to be clinched.
“The Premier League is where Middlesbrough belong,” he says. “And it’s where I want to be.”


The European Tour has been afforded the season ending climax marketeers dream of. Whoever prevails between Tommy Fleetwood and Justin Rose in the Race to Dubai, as will be determined over 18 holes at the Earth Course on Sunday, this has been a thrilling duel. The only disappointment for neutral onlookers is that Fleetwood and Rose will not play together in the final round of the DP World Tour Championship.
Rose stood in the middle of the 18th fairway here on Saturday afternoon with the order merit crown in his grasp. He held a single-shot lead over Dylan Frittelli and, crucially with the Race to Dubai in mind, one of two strokes over Fleetwood. The 26-year-old from Southport had earlier played his closing 11 holes in eight under par for a second successive 65. Fleetwood’s recovery from a day one 73 has been typical of his season-long approach.
Rose, in keeping with the gripping nature of this contest, was to find the water when seeking to reach the final green in two and thereby extend his lead. From there, the 2007 order of merit winner – who is seeking a third tournament win in succession – admirably scrambled a par to remain at 15 under. Nonetheless, Fleetwood still has Rose in his sights.
“Above all, whether I win it or not, or whether Justin wins it, one of us will have deserved it,” said Fleetwood. “It’s been an absolute pleasure trying to win a Race to Dubai, coming down these last few events and especially this week. The week could have gone not quite as how I wanted it, not being in contention or anything. So, last day of the season and I’ve got a chance to win the Race to Dubai, it’s cool.
“It’s been really enjoyable getting those low rounds going, seeing a few putts go in, hitting some great shots. It’s an enjoyable golf course that way, because if you’re playing well, days like today, scoring is so good; there’s a lot of guys shooting under par.
“So it’s great to watch and it’s great to play in the middle of it all, especially when you have a bit of momentum. It’s just very, very enjoyable and hopefully we can keep it going.
“Sunday will be nothing close to the biggest day of my life but in my career, it is. You have to enjoy these moments. This is what you practice for and this is what you play for. It’s brilliant, isn’t it? It makes me smile.”
On a third round day in which the course setup was noticeably generous, Frittelli’s 63 matched the lowest score of the week. Jon Rahm’s 65 placed him alongside the South African at 14 under par.


The British rider Daniel Hegarty has died after a horrific crash in the Macau Motorcycle Grand Prix. The 31-year-old, competing for Topgun Racing Honda, came off his bike at a sharp bend during the sixth lap and was flung into barriers, losing his helmet and sustaining fatal injuries.
The race was immediately red flagged and never restarted as Hegarty was treated. He died on his way to hospital. A statement from the race organisers on Twitter read: “The Macau Grand Prix Committee extends its deepest sympathies to the family and friends of Daniel.”
They added in a separate statement, as reported by motorsport.com: “Daniel’s family and team have been contacted, and the committee will ensure every assistance is extended to them.”
Hegarty, from Nottingham, who was a regular at the Isle of Man TT, had tweeted on Friday: “Positive Q2 jumped from 19th to 15th with much more competitive times. Really thankful to the @TopgunRacing1 team for their hard work. Bike is much easier to ride now.”


How to win in Australia? It is the pre-Ashes question that prompts past English triumphs to be recounted for guidance but it is also worth remembering that there is a more recent example of a touring side managing to, as Ivo Bligh put it in 1883, “beard the kangaroo in its den”.
Though a three-match series, and not the five-Test epic starting at the Gabba on Thursday, the 2-1 win by South Africa this time last year seems as relevant a case study as any for Joe Root’s side – and one they sought out over a beer during the summer after making it home and away victories over the Proteas from their most recent encounters.
South Africa, who claimed the first two Tests in Perth and Hobart for an unassailable lead, managed to induce a spell of frightful angst and bloodletting in Australian cricket along the way, too, such that headlines were awash with the word “crisis” and prompted the hosts to make six squad changes, including three new caps, come the finale in Adelaide. Now Australia remain favourites to regain the urn this winter for good reason. Home conditions are theirs, the whitewash of 2013-14 is still fresh (despite just three survivors in the home XI, to England’s five) and English away triumphs in Ashes series are scarce. If Australia are still in a state of flux, some of the individual home records are daunting, not least those of Steve Smith and David Warner.
But according to Russell Domingo, the former head coach of South Africa, whose side proved such disruptive guests and prompted Smith to declare his embarrassment in defeat, if the Australian captain and his firebrand opener are kept quiet as part of an overall plan to stifle the runs and pressurise the less established names, there is a chance of success. “Australia are a side that once they get on top, they are very difficult to stop. They bully you into submission,” Domingo told The Observer. “But if you can control the run-rate and get some movement, you have got a chance. England have bowlers that can do that, as we did. Technically Australia batters will struggle if you do, as they are used to flat pitches and free scoring.”
Unsexy as it is, the ploy is backed up by the numbers, with Australia kept to around three runs an over in both the defeats by South Africa and England in 2010-11, as opposed to rates in excess of four when they have won in recent times. But how can England’s bowlers stop Warner and Smith, batsmen who average 65 and 87 at home over the past three years respectively, in their tracks?
“Smith is a fantastic player and, at No4, the key is get him against the new ball. If the platform is set, he’ll bat a long time. So go for the jugular. Yes, he’s quirky with that style of his, walking across the stumps to play through the on side. But take a risk, put the extra man in there for protection and bowl straight for lbws or bowled.
“With Warner, he can seriously hurt you. We bowled pretty much into his thigh pad for as long as possible, as he’ll cut anything fourth stump or wider for four. We closed down his scoring options – basically frustrated him out – and that seemed to work for us. It’s boring but nullify the impact of those two and there is a good chance of getting them for under 200.”
South Africa did not have it all their own way last year. Though they rolled their opponents for 85 and 161 in the second Test to spark the national meltdown, their opening win in Perth was an epic fightback – at one stage Australia were 167 for one in reply to their 242, with Dale Steyn having broken down after 12.4 overs to be ruled out for the remainder of the match and series. What followed was an incredible turnaround from the rest of the attack, electric fielding and some dominant second-innings batting for a 177-run win.
Here Domingo credits the cool head of the captain, Faf du Plessis, for ensuring his side did not disintegrate, something he believes Root must replicate given there will inevitably be times when Australia are on the front foot. “The captain has to absorb the pressure when Australia are in charge, take the emotion out of it and stay true to the goals and strategies. Faf was outstanding in doing that and Joe, from playing against England this year, seems a calm guy who won’t get flustered. He will have to have that because the crowd and media will be all over him.”
Du Plessis did not only have to cope with the loss of Steyn — the fast-medium Kyle Abbott stepped up with 13 wickets at 14 in the last two Tests — but his side had already pitched up on tour without the resting AB de Villiers. Though the circumstances are wildly different, to put it mildly, what must England do to cope with the loss of their own talisman Ben Stokes? “Our mantra was that no one is irreplaceable,” said Domingo. “For each and every single member remaining, the game goes on. So you have to make the next guy in feel as important as an AB or a Stokes. You ask for 10 to 15 runs extra from each batter, you urge a couple more overs from each bowler and it all contributes to the goal. Some teams perform best in adversity.”
Perhaps the greatest challenge will come for England’s batsmen, with Australia’s seam attack of Mitchell Starc, Josh Hazlewood and Pat Cummins looking particularly tasty, even if the latter is, by virtue of his injury record, playing his first home series. Domingo, whose side had only two batsmen average above 40 but saw five of them score hundreds, explained their approach: “Hazlewood is the big thing. He’s fantastically skilled — like Vernon Philander but with a touch more pace. We felt that Starc, while he’s terrific when on top, he would give us chances to score. So it was a case of nullifying the effect of Hazlewood and looking to score against the rest. Both sides have question marks in their batting so it will be fascinating to watch.”
Now the above is riddled with caveats. South African bowlers are well used to the Kookaburra ball, such that 2016 was their third successive series win in Australia. They did not start their series at the fortress of the Gabba last year but rather Perth where they often thrive, nor will England play on the greener pastures of Hobart.
But given that Australia’s squad for the first Test appears to have thrown up as many questions as they wrestled with so tempestuously 12 months ago (and much of the time since was spent rucking with their board over contracts) it is worth remembering that they, like England, remain an imperfect team and therefore vincible.


Following a group stage of ups, downs and an overwhelming sense of room for improvement, the return of Sam Burgess for Sunday’s World Cup quarter-final against Papua New Guinea offers England belief that perhaps the best is yet to come: and how they will need it.
Burgess’s return from the knee injury suffered against Australia happily coincides with the beginning of the knockout stage and while the quarter-finals were straightforward for England to negotiate four years ago against France, the story could be markedly different in Melbourne.
To suggest rugby league is a way of life in Papua New Guinea would be an understatement. The only nation that has rugby league as its undisputed national sport, its passion for the game is emphasised by the fact well over a quarter of the population will be glued to TV sets on Sunday .
There are stories of locals walking miles to play and fans scaling mountains to see their heroes live. In PNG, rugby league is not only a game, it is everything – and how thankful England will be that they are playing them in Melbourne, not the tropical climate of Port Moresby.
The three sellout fixtures in the PNG capital during the group stage have created the most colour and perhaps the biggest positives for a tournament which, in certain areas of Australia, has struggled to command mainstream attention. In PNG the World Cup is all people are talking about.
There is a possibility the world may see much more of PNG in the coming years whatever happens against Wayne Bennett’s side. The long-term goal is a side competing in Australia’s elite competition, the NRL. Its strongest domestic side, the PNG Hunters, played in the second-tier Queensland Cup this year as a test of their ambitions – and they won the competition.
“PNG are unbeaten in the World Cup so far and full of confidence,” the England wing Jermaine McGillvary said. “You’re going to cop a few bruises against them when you play; they’ve always been physical but now they’ve got some top-level experience and some real talent.”
England players have never needed to burrow through jungle to get to training as youngsters but just as PNG have caught the eye throughout the tournament on and off the field, so has McGillvary – with his story also worth not neglecting.
The 29-year-old did not spend his teenage years playing academy rugby before being promoted to Huddersfield’s first-team; he spent his evenings and weekends working in a warehouse.
Rugby league was not on his radar until his friend and now Huddersfield team-mate Leroy Cudjoe convinced him to give it a go. Huddersfield signed him and, after a couple of loan spells in the lower leagues, McGillvary now finds himself a try-scoring sensation for club and country.
“I’ve come a long way,” he said. “A lot of people have helped me to reap the rewards but I’ve made a lot of sacrifices, too. I guess I’ve seen those sacrifices bear fruit in the last few years.”
McGillvary’s tournament was in doubt following a biting allegation by the Lebanon captain, Robbie Farah. He was acquitted after only three minutes at a hearing last week, leaving the focus to be on his performances – which have attracted admirers aplenty in Australia.
Is he interested in the NRL? “It’s something I may look at but it’s not really entered my mind before,” he said. “I’m happy at Huddersfield and I’ve never looked to try to get out. There’s never been any interest.”
Another strong performance to help England into the semi-finals and there may be more people taking notice of McGillvary.

New Zealand are out of the World Cup after Fiji edged a try-less game to book a semi-final date with Australia. The Kiwis, finalists in the last three tournaments, looked a shadow of their former selves and Fiji took advantage to claim a 4-2 victory in an error-strewn first meeting between the sides.
Fiji dominated the first half in Wellington but were too slow and laboured to break the Kiwis down as they failed to add to Apisai Koroisau’s penalty. The Bati could not make the most of Jordan Rapana’s sin-binning and only held a slender advantage heading into the closing stages after Shaun Johnson and Taane Milne exchanged two-pointers. But that proved to be enough as they held on to reach a third successive semi-final.
New Zealand, who lost star forward Jason Taumalolo to Tonga and were without Jesse Bromwich and Kevin Proctor for disciplinary reasons, made a bright start to the tournament but Tonga knocked the stuffing out of the 2008 champions and Fiji finished them off.
No side scored more points than Fiji in the group stage and they thought they had taken a fifth-minute lead through Brayden Williame, only for replays to show the Catalans Dragons player had failed to ground the ball.
New Zealand had made a shaky start following their shock defeat by Tonga and they were relieved to be just 2-0 down after 20 minutes with Fiji only having Koroisau’s penalty to show for their early dominance. The Kiwis lost back-rower Joseph Tapine to injury to cap off a miserable first 40 minutes but they were still well in the game at half-time.
Johnson got New Zealand on the board after Fiji were penalised for dissent but the Kiwis were immediately on the back foot again after Rapana was sent to the bin for a professional foul. New Zealand came through the 10-minute period unscathed after Williame had a try ruled out for a double movement. But any hopes they would build on that effort were dashed as Milne accepted the offer of two points after more Kiwi indiscipline.
New Zealand were gifted late field position after Kevin Naiqama lost the ball on his own 40-metre mark but Fiji knew the game was won when Brad Takairangi failed to reach Rapana’s kick. Press Association
Tonga survived an almighty scare to reach their first World Cup semi-final with a tense 24-22 win over Lebanon.
The Pacific Islanders were a shadow of the side that beat New Zealand in their previous game and were grateful for a contentious decision by English video referee Ben Thaler to disallow a Lebanese try for their victory.
The Cedars fought back from 16-6 down to get within six points by half-time and thought they had drawn level when centre Adam Doueihi went over on 45 minutes only to be denied by an obstruction ruling that looked harsh. Press Association


England’s final day in the field before they enter the Gabbatoir on Thursday could barely have been more chastening. They arrived needing six wickets, and ended up with one. Leaving the field at 4pm, when hands were shaken to terminate their toil, was emphatically not part of the plan. The opposition provided certainly look strong enough now.
There is some mitigation. The pitch was frightfully flat and Cricket Australia XI’s Jason Sangha and Matt Short, who put on 263, were superb maiden centurions. Indeed only Sachin Tendulkar, at Old Trafford in 1990, was younger in making a first-class century against England than Sangha, an 18-year-old from the Randwick Petersham club in Sydney (who David Warner and Usman Khawaja, lying in wait in Brisbane, have represented).
To boot, Sangha is the youngest first-class centurion in Australia for almost 25 years. The batsman then was one RT Ponting, also just a couple of months on from his 18th birthday, for Tasmania in January 1993. Trevor Bayliss was playing for New South Wales, the opposition, who also gave debuts to a couple of blokes called Glenn McGrath (he took a five-wicket haul, naturally) and Adam Gilchrist. At no stage in his previous three innings – which had brought a combined eight runs, including a second-ball duck in the first innings here – did he look a player close to a composed, classy hundred like this. His is a name worth jotting down.
England were largely listless, in plan and execution. Mark Stoneman dropped Sangha on 43 – a low Mason Crane full toss drilled high and hard to extra cover. Stoneman could only pop the ball up, Crane kicking the turf in frustration at the third dropped catch off his bowling this match. He knew not that he had four more hours of this coming up. England must taking such catches because they will seldom come along; it is also worth noting that they did not hit the stumps with a shy in any of the first warm-up games.
Crane and Moeen Ali were tidy enough, but the seam attack was benign and wicketless, with Stuart Broad anonymous, Chris Woakes cruising and Craig Overton flogged through ugly overs with ugly plans (it is no coincidence he has taken wickets when bowling a decent Australian length, not when ordered to fire bumpers to a leg-trap). They set about experimenting, with Broad at one stage having three men from silly mid-off to short extra-cover, as well as a silly mid-on.

The sense is that the Australians have the bowlers to take flat pitches out of the equation; England evidently do not. Jake Ball’s absence has certainly seen his stock rise and he fielded for the entire morning session before bowling 15 overs in the nets. Alastair Cook, meanwhile, stayed off the field all day.
Sangha and Short inflicted on England one wicketless session, then another. At 3.26pm, 256 minutes into the day’s play, Sangha went to sweep Crane, got a top edge and Dawid Malan took a decent catch tumbling forward at short fine-leg. Until then, the only thing that went to hand was a diving effort by a groundsman lurking beyond the boundary at long-on as Short tucked into Moeen.
Short survived to finish with a brilliant 134, to go with 51 in the first innings and four wickets, driving with confidence and pulling well too. He said after England lost seven for 42 in Adelaide that CA had found out a couple of their batsmen; he has now found out some of the bowlers too. The pair of them exploited gaps and drove England to distraction. The game ended with Joe Root and Malan bowling in tandem, taking as long as they could to complete their overs.
Bayliss, who said England’s XI for Brisbane is “pretty close in my mind”, was content, even after such a one-sided day. “We are always a bit disappointed when we don’t take 10 for 90 but the wicket was very flat, and those two young guys batted very well,” he said.
“Over the three games we have got as much about as much as we possibly could,” Bayliss said. “Today wasn’t the perfect game of cricket for us but it’s time in the dirt, and we will probably have another one or two of them in the Test matches. It was probably good to experience it and the heat as well.”
Still, the sight of Jonny Bairstow and Moeen padding up to face the bowlers who did not play – including Ball – in the middle was a reminder that England still have plenty of work to do.


David Moyes takes charge of his 500th Premier League game and his first as West Ham United manager. Unfortunately he will be without the club’s top scorer, Javier Hernández, who was injured playing for Mexico. Despite Moyes’s emphasis on improved work ethic, Marco Silva will probably look to apply as much pressure on West Ham’s porous defence as possible to stop a run of three defeats. Graham Searles

England’s official position as the world’s second-best team hangs in the balance at Twickenham on Saturday afternoon. A win for Australia would not only be enough to take the Wallabies above their hosts in the World Rugby rankings but also bring an abrupt end to England’s unblemished home record under Eddie Jones.
To date England have won all 11 of their home Tests since Jones took charge, nine of them by double-figure margins. The world champions, New Zealand, are not on that list but Chris Robshaw, a member of the England squad which cracked under the pressure of a home World Cup in 2015, believes Twickenham is once again becoming an extremely difficult place for any visiting team to play.
“You want your home ground to be a tough place to come,” said Robshaw, aware the current team still have a way to go to match Clive Woodward’s World Cup-winning squad, who went 22 home games unbeaten between 1999 and 2003. “If an opposing team enjoys playing there, it probably isn’t the place you think it is. If we can make it that kind of fortress again, it will be great.”
Robshaw was the England captain when Australia won 33-13 at Twickenham to knock the host nation out of the 2015 tournament’s pool stage but the Harlequins flanker will require no further motivation this time beyond the glimpse of a green and gold jersey.
“There is always a bit of extra spice because you are playing the Aussies. As a kid you grow up watching these games in various sports and to be part of it is pretty special.
“There tend to be quite a few Aussies in London and Twickenham is going to be rocking. There are a lot of fixtures which mean a lot but the England–Aussie sporting rivalry is brilliant.
“Eddie gives you the confidence and that bullish approach to go out there and perform. Especially at home you want to be on the front foot. We have to up our game in all facets from last weekend and start with great intensity. It’s going to be a great game of rugby.”
If anyone requires further incentive, Robshaw will point them in the direction of last year’s series whitewash in Australia “For a lot of us who had never actually won in the southern hemisphere, winning that series 3-0 against Australia was pretty special.”
This autumn’s target is to achieve a similar clean sweep, with next week’s game against Samoa completing the autumn series. “We always need to win regardless of how we are playing and our goal in this series is to win it 3-0,” Robshaw said. “We train like it’s a Test in midweek so Saturday is easier. Train harder than you play is Eddie’s mind-set.”
To keep England’s players on their toes Jones has also adjusted this week’s training schedule to try to replicate the logistics of travelling within Japan in 2019.
“That’s the good thing about this management – they are always looking for small improvements,” Robshaw said. “They don’t normally do something without a reason. What that reason is we’re not always sure – it is bloody hard at times I can tell you – but they’re always looking to get those marginal gains.
“Eddie has been to cycling and to various football clubs to see what they do. The big goal is that 2019 World Cup and to be in the best possible shape for that.”


‘A lot of women are intimidated by mixed rides because they think the men are going to go too fast.” I’m in Richmond Cycles, where Belinda, my ego-ideal from the Bella Velo club, has recently started working. Bella Velo still do a ton of women’s rides, but this is a mixed ride organised by the shop, and I am intimidated.
“But there’s nothing to be afraid of with these Mamils [middle-aged men in Lycra],” she says. “They’re free during the day, if you know what I mean.” Nope, not a clue. “Most of them are retired.” They don’t look very retired.

“It’s a social ride,” Sabina says. “The slowest person sets the pace.”
“I don’t want to set the pace,” I say. “I can’t take the pressure.”
“We won’t drop you. It’s a no-drop zone.”
We set off. Sabina has cool socks. Sarah has a cycling jacket with leather detailing, like a warrior princess. There’s something wrong with me. They are communing with their wheels and the tarmac, and I’m wondering where their clothes are from.
The ride is to Windsor, out through Twickenham and Bushy Park. At 10am, the fancy Middlesex streets had glittered in crisp winter; half an hour later, a romantic fog had settled, the sun glowing. There’s a lake in the centre of the park, some gilded Victorian celebrity rising out of it. God, it was all so beautiful: then, wham, four seconds later, we were out of there, waving at Hampton Court, burning down an A-road. What is wrong with these people? Why do they go so fast?
“That’s the good thing about cycling in a group,” Sarah says. “It’s so easy to cruise if you’re on your own.” She’s trying to persuade me to sit in Belinda’s back wheel (you conserve energy that way), but I can’t, because I’m scared. An hour in, all the things I was afraid of before we set off had become my most ardent desires: a puncture; an injury; a bleed on the brain. Anything. The hills, which nobody will call hills (“We’ll go right after this slight dip” was the memorable euphemism) were gruelling. By Prune Hill, about five miles outside Windsor, I’d had it. I got off the bike, giving unmistakable instructions, with semaphore as well as with talking, that everyone should go on without me.
About a year later, I crest the hill, pushing my bike, relishing the solitude, except the buggers are all waiting for me. “I’m not in your no-drop zone. I’m too tired for the zone.”
“Everybody,” says Anthony, the leader, “is in the zone.”
In Windsor Great Park, the deer appear like an apparition, a reward for the exertion, like climbing a mountain to see a gorilla. If I’d had to cycle home, which they were going to, I’d have done something desperate, like a carjacking. Instead, I take the train and watch them cycle off into the mist, feeling like a soldier who did his best, valiant, comradely, nearly dead.
Following someone else’s wheel can conserve up to 40% energy. Best to ask their permission first.


Nigeria may be within grasp of a historic first ever appearance in the winter Olympics, but the three members of the Super Eagles women’s bobsleigh team have bigger goals than simply qualifying to race next year in Pyeongchang.
But this is not Cool Runnings II, a sequel to the Jamaican bobsleigh team’s winter fantasy immortalised in the Hollywood hit movie.
Seun Adigun, Ngozi Onwumere and Akuoma Omeoga will not be heading to February’s games just to be a feelgood side story, they are looking for a medal.
No African nation has ever competed in an Olympic bobsled event and for this trio of trail-blazing Nigerian women getting to the winter games is where their journey begins, not ends.
They took a big step towards that goal this week in Calgary by completing the fifth of their required five qualifying races on the same track the Jamaican bobsled team shot to global fame at the 1988 Winter Olympics.
“We have goals,” Adigun, the driver and driving force behind the dream of a Nigerian team said. “I know the goal I have as a driver is to drive us to the podium, that’s just the competitor in me.
“A lot of our goals have been met just establishing this entire entity, starting this process and making our way to the games. “Obviously, the bigger goal is to just be as competitive as we can and obviously shoot for the podium.”
Although the Nigerians have achieved the qualifying standard, there is still work to be done. Countries hoping to race in Pyeongchang must be in the top 40 of the global rankings on 14 January 14 after seven World Cup races.
While the Nigerians have a little further to go, they have come a long way.
The reality of competing in South Korea began in a Texas garage in 2014, where Adigun, born in the United States to Nigerian parents, made her dream start to take shape by hammering together a makeshift sled out of wood and scraps that she named the Mayflower.
A former sprinter who competed in 100 metres hurdles for Nigeria at the 2012 London Olympics, Adigun recruited brakewomen Onwumere and Akuoma Omeoga to make her dream theirs.
The three women have plenty of drive, ambition and pure athletic ability but were short on cash as the hard work of getting to the Olympics was split between training and fund-raising.
Adigun, who fell in love with the sport as a brakewoman in the US bobsled program, estimated the Olympic bid to cost around $150,000.
“We did a homecoming in April as team to just go and introduce ourselves to the country so people would know we are serious,” Adigun said. “This is something we wanted to do for the continent and the country.”


Sir Bradley Wiggins’s former coach Shane Sutton has told a BBC documentary that he regarded therapeutic use exemptions (TUEs) as a legitimate way of finding “marginal gains” while staying within anti-doping rules.
The five-times Olympic champion’s use of the corticosteroid triamcinolone on three occasions in 2011, 2012 and 2013 was within the rules because of his doctor’s successful application for the TUEs; his contention has been that the drug – which is widely viewed as performance enhancing and is on the banned list if not used with a TUE – was necessary to treat his pollen allergies. Documents shown to the Guardian in September 2016 showed that the relevant consultants’ letters had stated that the use of the drug was appropriate and the applications were in order.
Sutton was interviewed for the documentary Britain’s Cycling Superheroes: the Price of Success, which investigated the controversies that have beset Team Sky and British Cycling in the past 14 months.
Sutton, who is now a coach with China, said: “If you’ve got an athlete that’s 95% ready and that little 5% niggle or injury that’s troubling them, if you can get the TUE to get them to 100%, of course you would in them days.
“The business you’re in is to give you the edge on your opponent and ultimately it’s about killing them off but you definitely don’t cross the line and that’s something we’ve never done.”
Asked if “finding the gains might mean getting the TUE”, Sutton repeated the question, before adding: “Yes, because the rules allow you to do that.”
The documentary, to be shown on BBC2 at 9pm on Sunday, appears in the same week that UK Anti-Doping revealed it was closing its inquiry into the contents of a Jiffy bag delivered to Team Sky at the Critérium du Dauphiné in 2011 because it had been unable to find definitive evidence. Wiggins denied that he had committed any wrongdoing and described the inquiry as a “malicious witch hunt”.
The Team Sky general manager, Sir Dave Brailsford, was also interviewed for the programme and said he felt the process had been above board. “If an athlete is hampered by an illness and there is a medication they can have and the TUE criteria are met, then they should [have it]. If Wada and the UCI signed this off and it was all absolutely clear and above board then I was comfortable with that.”
However, the timing of the TUEs has raised questions, coming each time immediately before three major objectives: the 2011 and 2012 Tours de France and the 2013 Giro d’Italia. The drug-taker turned anti-doping campaigner David Millar expressed a damning view of the affair when questioned by the BBC.
“They were gaming the system. I think that’s quite obvious. I think we all know that. It’s just hugely disappointing. Team Sky were zero tolerance, so you would think that zero tolerance would mean you weren’t going to tread into that very grey area which is cortisone use. When I heard that, a little bit of me died to be honest.”


The English Football League’s decision to deepen its relationship with the bookmaker Sky Bet has drawn criticism from campaigners, who claim the deal is another step to “normalising” a practice that creates widespread social harm.
In a deal the EFL described as “one of the longest and most significant partnerships in professional sport”, it has agreed to extend its relationship with Sky Bet by five years until the end of the 2023-24 season. The company will remain the title sponsor of the Championship, League One and League Two but will also acquire additional rights, including a licence to stream 18 matches per season on its website and broadcast live odds inside stadiums.
In announcing the deal the EFL chief executive, Shaun Harvey, said: “This agreement represents the largest title sponsorship in EFL history and once again illustrates how our commercial operations are maximising the revenue opportunities and exposure for the EFL and its clubs.
“I am delighted that an agreement has been reached and the EFL is looking forward to continuing to work with our friends at Sky Bet from now until 2024 on enhancing the experience for supporters while ensuring this is done in the most appropriate and responsible way.”
As part of the new arrangement Sky Bet will participate in a marketing campaign to promote gambling safety. In one element of this EFL clubs will add a swatch to their shirt sleeves promoting a responsible gambling message. But many campaigners are not convinced.
“There is increasing concern about problem gambling and the effect of gambling on young people,” said Jim Orford, professor of clinical and community psychology at Birmingham University and director of Gambling Watch UK.
“We also know how popular football is with young people, especially young men. Yet the relationship between football and gambling only continues to increase. Betting companies know they are under pressure but they employ measures that are tokenistic. There’s not much point in trying to mitigate the problem with badges and slogans when you’re only reinforcing the normalisation of gambling.”
The Sky Bet deal was also met with disapproval by GambleAware, the industry-funded body which promotes responsible gambling. In the past the group has encouraged the use of messaging to raise awareness but its chief executive, Marc Etches, was critical of the measures proposed by the league.
“We are concerned about the effect further exposure to gambling will have on the younger generation,” he said. “Today’s news confirms that gambling advertising in sport has now reached a tipping point and we run the serious risk of normalising an adult activity for young people. We welcome the commitment to do more to promote safer gambling, because we all have a responsibility to help protect those at risk of developing a gambling problem. However, t he messaging needs to be much more explicit about the risk involved than what the gambling industry currently proposes.”
Matt Zarb-Cousin of the Campaign for Fairer Gambling also voiced concerns. “The prevalence of gambling operators in football sponsorship is a symptom of the vast sums of money lost by gamblersin Britain and around the world,” he said.
“Their rapid rise in profits has been off the backs of those experiencing gambling-related harm. A report for GambleAware last week suggested that 59% of profits for online gambling companies come from problem or at-risk gamblers. People clearly aren’t stopping when the fun has stopped.”


Those who remember the days when today’s big race was sponsored by Mackeson will no doubt be a little wistful that there is no big-name runner to compare with Bradbury Star, a dual winner of the early 90s. But the race has once more done its job of delivering a big, competitive field and anyone who picks the winner will surely have to give some thanks for luck in running.
What we need is a horse who has shown he can cope with a bit of rough and tumble and Tully East (2.25) appeals on that score. The novice handicap he won at the March Festival was full of incident, with horses falling in front of him and close by as he moved up smoothly through the field.
I was especially impressed by how quickly he settled that argument when asked to go and attack the last. The extra 10lb he has been given here should not prevent a bold showing and he’ll be sharper for a recent spin over hurdles.
Starchitect seems most dangerous of the other market-leaders. He hasn’t blossomed over fences yet but has a race like this in him and his stable won a handicap chase here with their only runner yesterday. The athletic Plaisir D’Amour and the under-rated Lake Takapuna make each-way appeal.
1.50 Cheltenham It may be worth forgiving Premier Bond for a poor display in the Scottish National, when he was fitted with a tongue tie that has now been removed. He had previously looked a progressive young stayer and can improve beyond his current rating this winter.
2.45 Lingfield Making his first start for three months, Boynton was far too free when beaten by Victory Bond at Chelmsford last month and did well to finish within half a length of the winner. Having since run well at Newmarket, he can get a bit closer to his optimum performance here on a surface that probably suits him better than grass.
3.00 Cheltenham There was an eyecatching effort here last month from Kk Lexion, when his inexperienced jockey made an early dash for home. Adrian Heskin returns to the saddle aboard a horse with more to give at this sort of distance.
3.15 Lingfield With a record of eight from 14, Spring Loadedwarrants respect whenever he steps onto an all-weather surface. Now that he does so for the first time since January, it is encouraging that he has fared so well on turf since the summer, winning the Portland and going close in a similarly hot race at York. Paul D’Arcy’s grey looks the one to beat.
3.30 Cheltenham Red Indian ran a stormer on his handicap debut in May and, in hindsight, was attempting the impossible in conceding 9lb to a horse that has since won five times. He looks fairly treated and ought to appreciate this step up in trip.

Melbourne City coach Warren Joyce has declined to answer questions about his supposedly strained relationship with Tim Cahill amid speculation the Socceroos veteran could be looking for a move.
Joyce said he had not even spoken to Cahill since he completed his international commitments on Wednesday night and didn’t know when he would be available for A-League duty again.
Cahill wasn’t considered for selection for City’s 3-1 defeat to Brisbane Roar on Friday, but he was the hot topic of the night after a News Corp story emerged just before kick-off that alleged his relationship with Joyce was at “breaking point”.
It comes after Cahill blindsided Joyce following the Socceroos’ World Cup qualifying play-off win over Honduras by saying he had some “big decisions” to make about his future as he attempted to earn a spot in the squad for Russia 2018.
Joyce dismissed questions about the report but did not clarify the nature of his relationship with the 37-year-old when given the chance.
“I don’t see where that one comes from,” he said.
“I’m here to talk about the game anyway, to be fair. All the tittle-tattle that’s gone on this week is tittle-tattle ... I’m not really here to talk about Tim.
“I think there’s been enough conversations this week, I’ve answered every question that’s been thrown at me. I’m here to talk about the game.”
Joyce said the speculation had not bothered the team as they slumped to their second loss of the season against Brisbane, who snapped a six-game winless run courtesy of two goals from Avraam Papadopoulos.
“It can’t affect you if you don’t know anything about it,” he said.
As well as missing Cahill, City were also without injured star striker Ross McCormack (Achilles) and midfielder Marcelo Carrusca (calf).
McCormack is likely to return for next week’s home clash against Perth Glory but Joyce said Carrusca might take a little longer to recover from a training ground mishap.
Joyce was pleased with his side’s intent but said they were rightly punished for the three bad defensive errors that led to the Roar’s goals.
“I don’t think there was many chances created against us but you can’t expect to win any game and give three goals away like that,” he said.
Papadopoulos scored the opener and clincher for the Roar as they climbed off the bottom of the ladder in front of just 9285 supporters on a perfect Friday night at Suncorp Stadium.
Coach John Aloisi said it was a vital win for the team’s confidence after a sluggish start to their campaign, hampered by a spate of injuries to key players.
“We’re going to get stronger and stronger as the season goes on,” he said.
“It was a win that was important for us because of the situation (we’re in).”
Papadopoulos thwarted City goalkeeper Eugene Galekovic on both occasions punishing him for handling mistakes.
The first came just five minutes in, with Papadopoulos beating Galekovic in an aerial contest to nod home after Iacopo La Rocca’s attempted clearing header went straight up high.
Eric Bautheac had created the initial danger with a cross from the left and the zippy Frenchman scored the Roar’s second goal just two minutes from the break.
Again, La Rocca was at fault – he made a horrendous attempt at a backpass that was pounced on by Massimo Maccarone who held up the ball until Bautheac completed his run and slammed home from inside the box.
City made it 2-1 in the 54th minute as Stefan Mauk latched onto a pass from substitute Luke Brattan, his shot beating goalkeeper Jamie Young at his near post.
But Papadopoulos snuffed out the visitors’ comeback when the Melbourne-born former Greek international pounced after Galekovic dropped the ball while trying to collect a free kick with 20 minutes to go.
The 32-year-old shielded the ball with his body then swivelled around to trickle his attempt into the back of the net.
“It’s three horrendous individual mistakes,” Joyce said.
“You can’t fault the effort, desire, drive throughout the game ... but you can’t expect to win any game and give three goals away like that.”
Papadopoulos could have had a hat-trick from another goal-bound header before half-time but Mauk managed to clear it off the line.
The victory snaps a six-match game winless start to the season for the injury-hit Roar, while City are now without a win in their past three.


Mauricio Pochettino heads into Saturday’s north London derby insisting he is not jealous of Arsenal’s success in claiming two FA Cups during the three and a half years he has been Tottenham Hotspur manager, a period in which the Argentinian has significantly enhanced the club but failed to secure any silverware.
Pochettino was full of praise for Arsène Wenger before his seventh head-to-head meeting with the Frenchman since taking over at Tottenham in May 2014, describing him as a “special manager” and an “innovator”, but he was somewhat dismissive of his counterpart’s achievement of beating Aston Villa and Chelsea at Wembley in 2015 and 2017 respectively to secure the sixth and seventh FA Cups of Wenger’s Arsenal reign. Arsenal also secured their fifth FA Cup under Wenger, with a 3-2 victory over Hull City, 11 days before Pochettino moved from Southampton to White Hart Lane.
“Tottenham is Tottenham and Arsenal are in another stage of their project. I don’t care where they are, after three and a half years we achieve a lot,” said Pochettino. “I would like to achieve more; to be first and not second and win cups, but we are in a different stage of our project.”
Under Pochettino, Tottenham have secured third- and second-place finishes in the Premier League and this season secured progression to the knockout stage of the Champions League with two group games to spare and having beaten the European champions Real Madrid 3-1.
They are also viewed by many observers to be one of the most attractive, progressive teams in the country, yet tangible success remains elusive, with Spurs’ hopes of winning a first trophy since the League Cup in 2008 already dented by last month’s 3-2 defeat to West Ham United in the fourth round of the same competition.
Before that game, Pochettino had dismissed the importance of domestic trophies and he reasserted that view as he insisted Tottenham have no reason to look enviously upon their local rivals before their first meeting of the campaign.
“It is important to keeping doing well in a long process, important to improve every game and every season and say we can win not only cups but the Premier League and Champions League, that is the pressure we are building,” he said. “The pressure to win only cups is not useful for us. If we can win the Carabao Cup and the FA Cup – that is fantastic, but our principal option is to win the Premier League and put Tottenham in a position to win the Champions League.”
Pochettino hopes to have a number of players back from injury for Saturday’s encounter at the Emirates Stadium, including Harry Kane, Harry Winks and Dele Alli. Along with Kieran Trippier, Danny Rose, and Eric Dier they provide Tottenham with a strong English core, something the manager believes can be the foundations upon which the club’s long-term success is built.
“We believe in English talent and the [success of England’s] Under-17s, 19s, 21s make me believe even more in English talent,” he said. “We can build a very good core of English players with our identity, coming through our academy and English players coming from different clubs. It is an exciting challenge for us and exciting philosophy for us to build.
“There were eight 16-year-olds training with the first team yesterday. When we arrived here, 17/18 [year-olds] were seen as kids and training with the first team – that was crazy. Now eight 16-year-olds training with the first team, that is fantastic.”


At times it was difficult to know whether Tony Pulis was mounting a robust defence of his record, or just determined to get in a few pre-emptive strikes in the event he loses his job at West Bromwich Albion and is restricted to a carefully-worded statement that denies him the chance to say what he really thinks about his achievements at the club.
Either way, Pulis clearly recognises the end of his near three-year reign could be close after a wretched run that has delivered only two victories from the past 20 league games, leaving West Brom one place above the teams in the relegation zone and prompting supporters to turn on him during the 1-0 defeat at Huddersfield Town before the international break.
The feeling within The Hawthorns is that Pulis could be on the brink if there is more of the same disquiet – in particular in the stands – at home against Chelsea on Saturday, when Guochuan Lai, the club’s owner, will be looking on from the directors’ box after arriving from China for a visit that was scheduled six weeks ago but now feels rather timely.
Lai will lean heavily on John Williams, West Brom’s experienced chairman, when it comes to any decision, with Pulis honest enough to admit that sacking him would not be unfair on the back of his worst run of results for 13 years. From Pulis’s perspective, however, there is a broader picture and, armed with a few facts and figures, the 59-year-old set about dealing with the criticism that has come his way.
“If I left tomorrow I’d put my record on the table and put it in front of anybody and see what they think of what I’ve done here in three years,” Pulis said. “Yes, we’re on a bad run and everything is determined by the next game – no one ever looks back and sees there was Samaras, Varela, Pocognoli, Gamboa – 11 players were bought that summer [before he took over mid-season] and not one made a profit. I inherited those players and we finished 13th that year.”
There was plenty more where that came from. “Last season was only the third time in history this club has finished 10th in the Premier League. It’s only the second time since 1967 this club has finished the top Midlands club.
“We’ve played kids in this group since I’ve come in. They’ve made 89 appearances, the youngsters, and again no one else has done that. The record goes on and on and on.
“I understand. The more you give, the more people want. We brought in a lot of good players, players we hoped would gel straight away, and we’ve been unfortunate. [Nacer] Chadli, [James] Morrison and [Oliver] Burke are all players who can create and score, and we’ve not had them. Like every team, if you don’t have your best players, especially at the top end of the pitch, you’re going to struggle.
“People say the football’s been boring. The last two games at The Hawthorns have seen nine goals scored. Look at the league, there are four or five teams who have scored fewer goals than us. And one of those is my hometown club Bournemouth, and everyone tells me what great football Bournemouth play and Eddie’s done a fantastic job down there.”
Pulis went on to claim “expectations have gone through the roof” as he rowed back as far as 2005, when Bryan Robson pulled off what became known as the great escape, to make another point. “This club has fought relegation battles to the last days. They’ve had supporters carrying managers round the pitch on the last game of the season because of results going for them and kept them up. In the three years I’ve been here this club has been nowhere near getting relegated.”
It was a passionate and defiant response to questions about his future, and fair in some respects yet dubious in others, starting with the notion Chadli’s unavailability through injury has been a factor in the malaise – Pulis has been reluctant to play the Belgian when fit. Reporters were also left scratching their heads at the idea that youngsters had made 89 appearances under his watch, before eventually coming to the conclusion that the games played by Saido Berahino, an academy graduate who had already been called up to the England squad when Pulis was appointed, must be included in that number.
As for the theory that seeing nine goals flying in at The Hawthorns in the last two games provides some sort of counterargument to criticism of his style of football, Pulis neglected to mention five were scored by the opposition. Not only that but it will take much more than 180 minutes of football to persuade disgruntled fans entertainment is suddenly high on Pulis’s agenda, especially as in the first of those two matches, against Watford, West Brom were time-wasting from the start of the second half.
The past decade provides a more reliable barometer of Pulis’s approach. Over the course of 10 seasons with Stoke City, Crystal Palace and West Brom, Pulis has been manager for 321 Premier League games and seen his team score only 319 times – 157 of them via set pieces. In all but one of those seasons, the team that Pulis was in charge of registered the fewest number of passes in the division.
West Brom knew what they were getting in that respect – the statistics barely change season to season – but the board at the time, and to an extent the supporters, were willing to tolerate Pulis’s defensive and prosaic brand of football in order to keep them in the Premier League in the 2014-15 season. Beyond that it always felt like a question of when, not if, an uneasy alliance would come to an end. The big problem with Pulis’s football – as Stoke discovered towards the end of his reign there – is that everything is dependent on results, so when the narrow victories become draws and the draws become defeats, it is a fairly joyless experience.
The frustration this season is compounded because of a feeling Pulis is working with the best squad West Brom have assembled in the Premier League era, after more than £40m was spent in the summer to bring in Burke, Jay Rodriguez, Kieran Gibbs and Gareth Barry among others as well as Grzegorz Krychowiak on loan.
The bottom line is that something has to change, either on the pitch or in the dugout, to lift the mood. The dilemma for the board is Pulis has never been relegated during 25 years in management, which is why he got the job in the first place. Whether that is a good enough reason to stick with him now is another matter.
“I know the game, I know the score,” Pulis said. “I will speak to the Chinese, I’ll speak to John. I’ll get a feeling from them. It’s not about Tony Pulis, it’s about the club and the team and everything that surrounds it.”


Marko Arnautovic faces a fight to prove he has a future at West Ham after David Moyes warned the club’s record signing that he will not pick him until he becomes a team player.
The Austrian has been a big disappointment since his £24m move from Stoke City in the summer, failing to create or score a single goal in the Premier League, and he could fall victim to Moyes’s desire to shake up a lopsided squad unless he applies himself better before the transfer window opens in January. West Ham’s new manager, who has been tasked with pulling his team out of the bottom three after replacing Slaven Bilic on an initial six-month deal, has made it clear to the left-sided forward that he did not work hard enough under the previous management.
“I’ve told him this morning, the first time I’ve really had some time with him, and I said: ‘You’ll play in the team if you make goals and score goals, but if you don’t run for the team then you don’t play either,’” Moyes said. “I can accept one or the other, if you are making goals and scoring goals and the team is winning then I might not need so much of the other.
“I watched him at Stoke a lot and I thought he did the work for the team. I’ve never worked with him before so I am roughly getting to know him. What I can do is give him confidence and say: ‘When you are ready to play, we hope to see what you can do’.
“I can only go on what people have told me and they didn’t think he has come up to the standard he set at Stoke City. At Stoke I thought he looked like the sort of player you would never be keen to play against if you’re a right full-back because of his power and strength and what he can do.
“But he also has to be a team player. The clips I have seen, at times he has not looked a team player. He would not be the only one I would say that about. The other players also have to do the work for the team if they want to be part of it.”
Arnautovic could find himself on the bench when West Ham visit Watford for Moyes’s first game on Sunday afternoon. “The hardest thing at the moment is that I have got four to five people who want to play wide left,” Moyes said. “I have tried to go around them and say to them: ‘OK, I will try and get you where you feel best suited.’ But I have got four to five of them to get into the team.”
Moyes’s comments on Arnautovic chimed with what he told the squad in a meeting this week. The 54-year-old has seen the statistics showing that West Ham have made the fewest sprints and covered the second lowest distance in the Premier League and he will not tolerate any indiscipline. While the players explained what went wrong under Bilic, Moyes wants them to take responsibility.
“I’ve just not got any time for any nonsense,” Moyes said. “I’m not going to be pampering to any needs. I can’t be bothered. If anybody says they can’t get back from international duty, well, don’t think you will be coming in and playing Saturday. It’s that sort of thing. It can’t happen any longer.
“I need results quickly. If not it will be you boys or somebody else saying it will be something to do with David Moyes. The only way I am going to get results is if those players give me the chance to get them. I am certainly not pussyfooting around with them.”


Manchester United want to sign Gareth Bale from Real Madrid and are not put off by the forward’s injury problems because they believe they would be able to improve his condition.
Bale has missed 40 of Real’s last 60 matches because of injury. He has not played since late September and is expected to be out for a further month and a half after suffering a thigh problem last week when he was nearing a return from calf trouble.
That was the Wales international’s 19th injury since he joined Real in September 2013 for a then world record £85m but it is understood this is not a concern for United. José Mourinho has previously tried to bring Bale to Old Trafford and remains keen to do so, though any bid is expected next summer rather than in January.
United are encouraged by Bale’s better appearance record when at Tottenham Hotspur and believe they could return him to a similar level of games. He played 52 matches in the season before his move to Madrid, 48 the campaign before and 44 in 2010-11. Bale earns about £350,000 a week after tax and is contracted until 2022. He has a €1bn (£890m) buyout clause but given his injury issues Real would demand considerably less if they wanted to sell him.
United’s injury problems are easing, with Paul Pogba, Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Marcos Rojo available for Saturday’s home game against Newcastle United. Mourinho picked out Pogba’s absence as a particular hardship for the team.
Pogba pulled a hamstring during the 3-0 Champions League win over Basel on 12 September. United were unbeaten at that point but surrendered that record when losing 2-1 at Huddersfield a month later. They also lost at Chelsea in the last match before the international break. Ibrahimovic and Rojo have been out since April with knee injuries..
Mourinho said: “Now I can speak because Paul is back but you can clearly see Manchester United this season before Paul’s injury and after Paul’s injury. There are qualities in our football that influence our approach in matches, with Pogba and without Pogba, that’s as simple as that.”
Ibrahimovic ended last season as United’s top scorer with 28 goals, despite his campaign ending early.
Mourinho said: “Zlatan last season we played with him every minute almost until he was injured. This season we learn how to play without him but he’s a very important player. We welcome him back.
“He has an incredible personality to fight such an important injury. We were all saying in 2017 he will be back but one thing is 31 December 2017 and another thing is mid-November. He was as an injured player the same super professional he is when he’s fit.
“So fantastic work – same as Marcos, who had a serious injury too, a big surgery. He played with the young boys [the reserves] on Wednesday and is fine, is confident, is also ready. Paul is obviously not the same dimension, was not a surgical situation but was also bad and all three are back.”
Of the 36-year-old Ibrahimovic, Mourinho added: “You cannot expect him to play 90 minutes or consecutive matches like he did all his career. Now he needs time to be back for his level, his fitness, his confidence, everything, his sharpness, but by the clinical point of view it is fantastic to be ready.”
United are in second place, eight points behind Manchester City. Mourinho pointed to the two derby games as vital if they are to catch City.
“I am confident that tomorrow we can win against Newcastle, and that is the way we have to look at it: to play every match thinking we can win and to think we play against City in two matches where we can interfere with the situation,” he said. “All the other matches Manchester City plays we cannot interfere with. We can watch it, we can agree with some referee decisions in their matches, yes or no. But we can’t interfere.”


David Unsworth insists he has not been undermined by Everton’s failure to appoint a new manager as their search for Ronald Koeman’s successor approaches a fifth week.
Unsworth remains in caretaker charge for Saturday’s visit to bottom club Crystal Palace after Everton’s advances towards Marco Silva were flatly rejected by Watford. Farhad Moshiri, the club’s major shareholder, may return with an improved offer for Silva – who on Fridaycalled Everton a “big club” – next week, although the Portuguese coach has not agitated for a move and Watford, who declined an £8.5m compensation package for the former Hull City manager, maintain the 40-year-old is going nowhere.
Everton’s only win under Unsworth arrived against Silva’s team before the international break. Their only Premier League away success of 2017 came in January against a Palace side managed by Sam Allardyce, another candidate approached by the Everton hierarchy. Allardyce appeared to rule himself out of the running this week despite not being offered the job. “It would surprise me that anyone would rule themselves out of being Everton manager,” said Unsworth.
The club’s under-23s manager has made no secret of his desire to succeed Koeman on a permanent basis. A win at Palace, combined with Watford’s resolve over Silva, would promote that cause but Unsworth rejects claims the prolonged uncertainty has undermined his position.
“It doesn’t undermine me at all,” he said. “I can only control players on the training field, pick a team and go into every game with a gameplan. That’s no change to what I would normally do even if I was given a 10-year contract. It doesn’t matter, because what we have done so far is what we would do anyway. I have stayed away from most of the speculation and I am fully focused on coaching the team. Yes, they could have given me the job by now but I am still sat here, and what will be will be. I am totally fine with that.”
Unsworth admitted he had “not really been sounded out” about potential January transfer targets but resembled a protective Premier League manager when he claimed Morgan Schneiderlin and Kevin Mirallas were “fully committed” to Everton. The pair walked out of a training session before the win over Watford, in which they did not feature, having been accused of a lack of effort by the first-team coach, Duncan Ferguson. “There was no real story,” claimed Unsworth, adding: “Both were given an option of finishing their training and that was absolutely fine.”
Moshiri, the chairman Bill Kenwright and the director of football Steve Walsh have been accused of lacking direction in their handling of Koeman’s departure. “From my point of view it gives me an extended opportunity to be successful with the squad of players,” said Unsworth. “That question must be aimed at other people. I can’t answer that.”


Kyle Walker has urged Manchester City to create something special under Pep Guardiola and achieve even greater success than the manager’s former club Barcelona.
City lead the Premier League by eight points from Manchester United after 11 matches and their flying start and style of play have led to comparisons with Guardiola’s Barça. The Catalan took charge at the Camp Nou in 2008 and in four years led them to win the Champions League twice, La Liga three times, the Copa del Rey twice, and also double successes in the Uefa Super Cup and Fifa Club World Cup.
Walker, asked about comparisons between City and Guardiola’s Barcelona, said: “It’s a lovely compliment because what a team that was. If we can come close to what they achieved in his reign there at Barcelona it’ll be fantastic.
“But let’s not just settle for that, let’s go above that if we can because we’ve got the players to do it, got the manager and hopefully we can merge everything together and come up with something special.”
Guardiola is certainly not getting carried away and insists there is still room for improvement. Already on a record-breaking run of wins the City manager has claimed he is not interested in setting benchmarks for posterity, just getting better week on week. “I’m not here to break records, I’m not bothered about being magnificent, I’m about trying to make the team better than it was yesterday,” Guardiola said. “We are playing well, and I am very happy with results, but a team can always get better and there are still things we can improve.”
Guardiola makes a point of going through each game with the team, even after convincing wins, highlighting individual mistakes and areas where different options might have been preferable.
“It helps keep the players motivated and guards against complacency,” he explained. “We analyse all the games and point out all the mistakes, so that players know they can always do better. That is important, because the moment we start to believe we can’t get any better is the moment we crash. I’m not looking for perfection – that is impossible in a football match – but there is always something worth looking at. We still miss a few easy balls, for instance, and we don’t always finish our counterattacking actions. When you look closely at each match you can always see some situations we could have controlled better, and reviewing our performances each week gives us something to aim for.”
The league leaders are at Leicester City on Saturday afternoon, when Guardiola will be looking for a significant improvement on the 4-2 defeat almost a year ago. That was one of the better performances in the Foxes’ troubled title defence and it coincided with one of Manchester City’s worst. Guardiola admits it was one of the lowest points of his first season in England.
“It was one of the worst days, yes,” he said. “The way Leicester play is so complicated, and in that game they played the way they did when they were champions. Every mistake we made was punished, they were so quick on the break and decisive in their finishing.”
Claudio Ranieri was still in charge of Leicester last December, Claude Puel has succeeded Craig Shakespeare since, but Guardiola is still wary of the threat posed by Jamie Vardy, Shinji Okazaki and others. “I don’t think the new manager will have had much time to adjust to his team, he has only been there a couple of weeks and many of his players will have been away in that period,” Guardiola said. “But as far as I am concerned Leicester still have a lot of talented players. It is one of the toughest fixtures we face, especially after an international break.”
Guardiola was able to confirm Sergio Agüero is back in full training and available for selection after his fainting episode with Argentina. “He’s perfect, there’s nothing to worry about,” he said and is also confident Raheem Sterling is overcoming the back problem that troubled him in recent games against Napoli and Arsenal and saw him pull out of the England squad as a precaution, though he is less sure about Fabian Delph, who has yet to return to full training following a calf strain. With Nicolás Otamendi suspended Guardiola will have to make changes in his backline anyway, with Eliaquim Mangala a possible option at centre-half.


José Mourinho has made clear his frustration at the England setup’s handling of Phil Jones after revealing the defender had been given six local anaesthetic injections in his thigh before last week’s friendly against Germany.
Jones started as England’s most-capped player for the goalless draw at Wembley, but hobbled off midway through the first half with a recurrence of an injury first sustained in the Premier League defeat at Huddersfield Town in mid-October. Gareth Southgate, whose handling of Danny Drinkwater’s decision not to join the senior squad has also drawn criticism of sorts from Antonio Conte, duly released the United centre-half but, having missed the draw with Brazil on Tuesday, Jones has been ruled out of Newcastle United’s visit to Old Trafford.
“With Phil Jones the strange thing is that I have been a manager since 2000 and, in 17 years as a manager, I don’t have one single player that had injections of anaesthetic to play a friendly,” said Mourinho. “Never. I am not an angel and I had players injected to play official matches, crucial matches, but a friendly? To get six local anaesthetic injections to play a friendly, I’ve never heard of that. But Phil Jones had it and had it before the match, and after 25 minutes he was out and tomorrow he is out.”
Asked if he had spoken to Southgate or the Football Association to ascertain why Jones had so many injections, Mourinho said: “No. I am just telling a fact. He was injected in the afternoon of the match [last Friday]. He didn’t feel good during the warm-up. Between the warm-up and the start of the match he had five more local injections to play the friendly. I have nothing more to say.”
The FA’s medics are content that Jones returned to Carrington in the same condition in which he had arrived at St George’s Park, and had given their counterparts at United notice of their intention to give the player the course of injections – considered standard in pain relief – with no objections raised. Indeed, even the 25-year-old had acknowledged in the buildup to the Germany friendly that pain-management was a continuing concern.
Conte, as a former Italy manager, was more sympathetic with Southgate’s predicament when it came to the national coach’s telephone conversation with Drinkwater to determine the midfielder’s availability in the aftermath of six senior withdrawals before the Germany fixture. However, he urged Southgate to contact him directly in future to ascertain whether a player is fit after a “misunderstanding” led to suggestions the £35m signing’s reticence to join up reflected a lack of enthusiasm to represent his country.
Chelsea have always insisted Drinkwater, who has been unavailable for all of Southgate’s squad get-togethers to date, took a kick to his troublesome calf during a cameo as a substitute against United, which prevented him undertaking the post-match warm-down, and subsequently ruled him out of training at Cobham.
Southgate appeared to be unaware of that fact on the eve of the Germany game. “Sometimes I think it would be very easy to try to call the coach and ask: ‘This player is good? Is he totally fit? Does he have a problem? Is he tired or not?’” said Conte. “Then the national coach can decide whether they call up the player or not. Otherwise there are these misunderstandings. And it’s a pity a player has to pay for this misunderstanding.
“Drinkwater had an injury, and also wasn’t really 100% fit to go with the national team. If someone had asked me this, I could explain that. If the coach then wants to take his own decision, that’s OK. But it’s important to have more of a relationship between the coach and the coach of the national team. It was the same for Eden Hazard [when he was called up by Belgium in August despite having failed to represent Chelsea up to then following ankle surgery over the summer]. I spoke to Roberto Martínez, and then he played.
“I’m the first to be ready to help every single coach of a national team because I understand very well the problems [they face]. Now, for sure, I’m more open to this than when I was coach of Juventus. But Drinkwater was very honest. He doesn’t deserve to be attacked. In this situation every single player would want to go with the national team who is calling them. We have to appreciate his behaviour and his commitment.”
That such a relationship does not appear to exist already between England and the Chelsea setup is all the more surprising given Southgate visited Cobham last season and is now assisted by Steve Holland, who was Conte’s No2 last term. “Steve’s a really good person, an intelligent person,” said the head coach. “If they want, I’m ready to help every coach of the national team. Not only the English.”
Conte saw Tammy Abraham and Ruben Loftus-Cheek, players he considers “the future of Chelsea” who are treading a similar loan route to that of his current centre-back, Andreas Christensen, make their debuts for the England senior side in the window while they gain first-team experience at Swansea and Crystal Palace respectively. The head coach suggested it is easier to blood younger players in friendly fixtures, even at international level, rather than in the highly pressurised Premier League.
“You can do ‘experiments’ under different pressure,” he added. “We must be very intelligent and clear to understand these differences: when the result is not important. For the clubs, the results are always important. Otherwise, [there are calls to] sack the manager and there is the pressure of the press. It’s totally different.”


Jürgen Klopp has allayed concerns over his health and ordered Liverpool’s players to keep him out of hospital by winning games.
The Liverpool manager missed training on Wednesday when he visited a local hospital as a precautionary measure. “I have been twice in a British hospital now,” said Klopp, who had an appendix operation in February 2016, “and whatever people say about it, the NHS is not as bad as you think!” The 50-year-old confirmed he was given the all-clear by doctors before being released on Wednesday night and allowed to take training at Melwood the following day.
“I am really completely fine,” he explained. “It is not that someone should expect I have to go back in to hospital tomorrow. I told the players that the doctor said the only thing that can kill me is if we lose football games. That’s it. I am completely fine. It was nothing. It is like it is sometimes when people think: ‘Oh, that’s it.’ I went there and they said: ‘OK, all good,’ but for this they needed a little bit of time. They have a lot of machines. I knew from the first second that I had nothing – unfortunately I was the only one. Afterwards everybody knew it.”
Klopp appeared more concerned about the health of Liverpool’s squad before Southampton’s visit to Anfield, a game that marks the start of a demanding sequence of 13 matches between Saturday and 1 January. Joël Matip is doubtful with a groin problem and Adam Lallana is unlikely to make his first start of the season despite resuming full training earlier this week. But with Lallana recovered from a thigh injury sustained in pre-season, Sadio Mané in contention to face his former club after a hamstring scare and Philippe Coutinho available following an adductor problem, the Liverpool manager admits his squad is nearing full fitness at the right time.
“Everyone will be required, 100%,” said Klopp, who last season cited a gruelling fixture schedule with Liverpool’s January downturn. “If the players don’t know that I need them all in this period then I cannot help them. That is how it is. We need them and we need them in the best, best, best shape. We have only important games. Southampton is unbelievably important. Sevilla next week? Unbelievable. Chelsea next Saturday? Wow. It goes bam-bam-bam but I am looking forward to it. It is really good. Hopefully we can keep this group healthy, fit and full of desire.”
The Liverpool manager also praised Gareth Southgate’s decision to give Dominic Solanke his senior England debut against Brazil on Tuesday, despite the 20-year-old starting only once at club level this season. Klopp insists the former Chelsea striker and the Liverpool defender Joe Gomez represent the country’s future at international level.
He added: “It was 100% the right decision. It was a situation where a few players were missing but he will be a future player for England. He has got everything you need. You saw in 15 minutes that he got involved immediately. That is him. Next time he is involved it will be no problem. Players like him, Joe, Tammy Abraham and Ruben Loftus-Cheek are the future for England. It is cool. If they want to be involved a little earlier or a little later, no problem. He has quality and that is good.”


Andy Murray and Ivan Lendl have split for a second and no doubt final time – wishing each other season’s greetings and the best for the future – but, whoever triggered the divorce, the parting inevitably throws the player’s comeback in January into minor confusion.
An insider said on Friday night that Murray’s touring coach, Jamie Delgado, will remain in place – “so there is no need to rush anything” – while he looks for a replacement ahead of his return to the Tour in Brisbane on New Year’s Day after four months with a hip injury that has ruled him out since the quarter-finals at Wimbledon.
“I’m thankful to Ivan for all his help and guidance over the years,” said the former world No1, who will embark on his comeback from a ranking of 16 at the Australian Open. “We’ve had great success and learned a lot as a team. My focus now is on getting ready for Australia with the team I have in place and getting back to competing. Huge thanks to Ivan. I wish him all the best.”
Lendl, who was with Murray from late 2011 to 2014 before returning to the job last year, said: “I wish Andy well going forward. We had a great run and a lot of fun.”
However, Lendl is understood to have demanded a considerable pay rise to return to the job after helping Murray to his first two slam titles and his gold medal at the 2012 London Olympics.
Murray, who was unsettled by Lendl’s first departure, might struggle to be philosophical about this undoubtedly final farewell to a man he has held in awe more than he has any of the seven coaches he has had in 12 years on the Tour.
They appear to have agreed to call the parting mutual. That is unlikely. When Lendl left last time, he said he wanted to spend more time with his ailing parents and his daughters, who were making their way on the golf circuit. He also had fitness issues and a loathing of long-distance plane travel.
The official line from the player’s website on Friday night was: “Murray will continue to build his fitness with a training block in Miami before heading to Australia in December ahead of Brisbane and the Australian Open.”
Lendl now turns his attentions to Patrick Kypson, an 18-year-old American prospect ranked 895 in the world who recently won a title on the Futures circuit.


The debutant Jessica Breach scored six tries as England’s women marked a milestone match with an emphatic victory against Canada.
The Red Roses, in their first game since the Rugby Football Union confirmed the team would receive match fees for the first time, ran in 13 tries at Allianz Park.
The Harlequins winger Breach raced over on England’s left on three occasions as she completed a hat-trick in the opening half-hour. Rachael Burford also scored early on and Abigail Dow touched down under the posts a minute before half-time as England took a 29-0 lead at the interval.
Breach added her fourth try, bursting through the middle of the visiting defence, and after Amy Cokayne crossed the line, the 20-year-old grabbed her fifth in the corner.
Marlie Packer touched down before Cindy Nelles scored from close range to get Canada on the board in the 61st minute but Dow added her second soon afterwards before Breach collected a high ball and surged over for her sixth.
Rochelle Clark ran in England’s 12th try before Breach set up her fellow debutante Ellie Kildunne to finish the try-scoring in the first of the three-match series.
As well as Breach, there were seven uncapped players in England’s matchday squad, with Breach and Dow the two starters on each wing. Caity Mattinson, Kildunne, Zoe Harrison, Shaunagh Brown and Hannah Botterman came off the bench to make their international debuts at Saracens’ home ground.
It was a less satisfying night for Saracens themselves, though, as Mark McCall’s men let slip an eight-point lead to lose 23-17 to Gloucester at Kingsholm.
The visitors dominated the first half and scored the game’s opening try in the 53rd minute through Schalk Brits but Ollie Thorley and Tom Hudson crossed in the final quarter to secure victory for Gloucester, who move up to third in the table. Billy Twelvetrees converted both tries and kicked three penalties while Alex Lozowski kicked nine points and Ben Spencer landed a late penalty for Saracens.
The leaders were able to include George Kruis and Lozowski after both were released from the England squad, but the No8 Jackson Wray was a late withdrawal with a neck injury.
Twelvetrees put Gloucester in front with a penalty after eight minutes but this was soon nullified by one from Lozowski. The opening 15-minute period was disjointed as the referee, the former Harlequins scrum-half Karl Dickson, marked his Premiership debut by awarding a succession of penalties.
Lozowski could have given his side an advantage but was off-target with a 30-metre drop goal attempt, but moments later his penalty gave Saracens a 6-3 lead after 18 minutes. Saracens were in control at this stage.Resolute defending from Gloucester kept the visitors out but a minute before the interval Lozowski knocked over his third kick for a deserved 9-3 half-time lead.
After the restart Gloucester raised their game to compete with the intensity levels of the visitors and were rewarded with a second penalty from Twelvetrees. The hosts then took off their captain, Will Heinz, in favour of the more attacking youngster Ben Vellacott but it did not pay immediate dividends as a burst fromBurger set up the first try of the game for Brits. Twelvetrees kept his side in contention with a third penalty to reduce the deficit to 14-9 going into the final 20 minutes.
A clever inter-play from Vellacott and Andy Symons took the home side into Saracens’ 22 before a well-judged kick from Burns put in Thorley to collect and score. An excellent touchline conversion from Twelvetrees put his team ahead for the first time.
They completed a remarkable turnaround when Vellacott sent Hudson in under the posts before Spencer’s last-minute penalty secured a bonus point for Saracens.


When Eddie Jones was trying to motivate his Australia teams before playing England he instinctively knew which green and gold buttons to press. “We were part of the empire and we always looked up to England,” he recalled. “England was seen as the mother country; it’s like the little brother trying to take on the big brother.” Stereotypical labels or not, the plucky Aussie battlers would pile into the arrogant Poms and everyone knew their lines by heart.
A slightly subtler narrative is involved these days. Jones is employed by England and sledging the great southern land of his birth is becoming less straightforward. Under the well-travelled Michael Cheika the Wallabies have won their last seven Tests and are finishing the year like Melbourne Cup winners. The routine home win anticipated by Twickenham’s patrons suddenly feels as nailed on as World Rugby’s recommendation of South Africa to host the 2023 World Cup.
This partly explains why Jones has been reacting so testily to the widespread ho-humming that followed his side’s 21-8 grindathon against Argentina. “If you read the papers it’s like we’ve gone into reverse after one 80-minute performance,” he muttered. “If I can get them going forward even in first gear, we’ll be doing well.”
Fuelling his sarcasm is the belief that he deserves more respect for steering England to 20 wins in his 21 Tests in charge. “I must admit I really struggle with the sort of commentary I’m hearing about the team. We’ve had 21 games and won 20 of them. We’ve had one game people have called flat and now the whole team has stalled. Give me a break, guys.”
It is a tricky one. Of course English rugby has good reason to be grateful to Jones for picking up the pieces so expertly in the wake of the 2015 World Cup implosion. Equally, it is what happens next that will define his stewardship. It is only a fortnight ago, after all, that Jones was urging everyone to draw a line under the initial phase of his tenure and encouraging all his players to aim higher. Beating Argentina at home with a mere 37% possession may have reflected well on England’s defensive resilience but it was hardly the stuff of world-beaters.
Some of these deficiencies may, admittedly, have received less prominence had Jones not been caught on camera cursing his own team’s stupidity. As with Martin Johnson thumping his desk in 2009 when Danny Care was sent to the sin-bin in Ireland, it inevitably became the story, prompting Jones to return fire at the dastardly television rights holders who help fund his generous salary.
“What else do you want me to do? I’m sure Sky Sports are going to be on me the whole game. We’ve asked them to get a bit closer and have more shots. Don’t follow the rugby, just follow me. I’ve got a nice new white English pen; if I throw that, it’s going to create some great television. If the rugby doesn’t entertain you, I’ll find another way. I’m always excited, mate. What do I have to do this week? Jump from the grandstand?”
When it comes to jousting with the media – “I don’t know what excites you guys but it’s definitely not winning consistently” – Jones remains in a class of his own. But if New Zealand were coming to Twickenham this weekend, would England beat them? Have they enough to see off the Wallabies, let alone make a long-term statement? Slide backwards – or sideways – now and the Six Nations will become a proper bunfight.
Jones flatly rejects this angle of inquiry and argues people are not seeing the wood for the eucalyptus trees in the aftermath of last summer’s Lions tour. “By 2018 at some stage we’ll have all our players back, we’ll have them fit and then you’ll see the team roar. Until that stage we’ve just got to stall along. It’s like an old Vauxhall Viva that used to stall all the time. You’ve got to get out and get someone to help you push it – that’s where we are at the moment. We don’t need a bit of momentum, we need to keep getting better.”
It does not require an interpretative lip-reader to summarise this as follows: wait until we get Billy Vunipola, Ben Te’o, Manu Tuilagi and Jack Nowell back fit and Maro Itoje on from the start and then tell me England do not have game-breakers.
Australia, though, have more caps in nine positions out of 15 and Kurtley Beale’s return has offset the loss of Israel Folau and the sabbatical-taking David Pocock. Last month they beat New Zealand and Jones knows Cheika well enough to read his mind on these occasions. “It’s an important game, it’s England v Australia and they’re always important. Certainly when I was Australia coach it was the game on the tour you wanted to win. I’m sure Australia’s the same now.”
Should Australia prevail for the first time since walloping their hosts 33-13 in the 2015 World Cup pool stages, it would be Jones’s first defeat in five meetings as England’s coach. On tour down under in 2016 England were outstanding andsince 2010 they have beaten the Wallabies eight times in 10 attempts. Both sides clearly have an eye on the 2019 World Cup in Japan but classifying this 49th meeting (to date Australia have 25 wins to England’s 22) as a meaningless friendly overlooks the perennial quest for bragging rights which still defines Anglo-Australian sport.
With the Ashes commencing shortly, the Socceroos reaching the World Cup in Russia and Australians voting in favour of same-sex marriage, there is also an increasingly feelgood mood beneath the southern cross. Both Cheika and the Wallabies assistant coach, Stephen Larkham, a good mate of Jones’s from their days working together in Canberra, have felt confident enough to deliver a sly verbal dig or two, with Larkham suggesting his former boss is “spoilt” in his new role given English rugby’s vast financial resources.
He did not have to wait long for Jones’s return of serve: “When we get out there it doesn’t matter whether you’ve got a union with £450m in the bank or Aus$1m in the bank. It’s all even. I love Stevie and I want him to do well as a coach. I just don’t want him to do well on Saturday.”
It all adds up to a fascinating match. Without the faithful Mike Brown at full-back, the average age of England’s backline is now only 25 and, as the demoted George Kruis has found out, rugby’s fortunes can turn swiftly. In last year’s equivalent fixture, England won 37-21 but trailed at half-time and, in Jones’s words, “were terrible in the first-half”. This time they will be expected to start faster and, above all, generate the quicker ball their rapid backline are desperate to have.
The late reshuffle in which the uncapped Brumbie lock Blake Enever replaces the injured Adam Coleman is a major blow for Australia and Owen Farrell’s boot may also prove crucial.
“We bowled a lot of flat off-spinners against Argentina … now we need a couple of wickets,” Jones said. To continue the analogy, England also need to play a few more shots.


One of sport’s great passions is raging at selectors. It’s not a job that wins praise. But something is more deeply awry on the Australian panel than disagreement, a malaise that has persisted through changes of personnel.
The problem isn’t decisions made. It’s the spurious justifications given. It’s the complete lack of any coherent policy, core belief or overarching rationale. The reasons given for one selection vanish for another. Principles committed to in one case are abandoned. Panel members pick whoever they feel like, then invent a reason, building arguments so flimsy that a Big Bad Wolf would only need to give a meaningful look.
This Ashes side mostly could have picked itself. Only the wicketkeeper was an obvious flaw. Of the other two changes, you can make an argument for dropping Matt Renshaw due to Cameron Bancroft’s eye-catching run. You can counter-argue that Renshaw’s last Test innings in Australia was 184, he played important knocks on tough Asian tours, and that quiet domestic games to start the home season are largely irrelevant.
That is fair discussion. The hypocrisy starts once the call is made. “We would like him to go back to first-class cricket and push his name forward with the selection panel through big runs,” said Hohns, though his panel has spent years ignoring others who’ve done the same.
At the same time as saying domestic results matter, the panel picked Tim Paine. Australia needed an in-form wicketkeeper who could remedy a shortage of runs from Matthew Wade. Paine has kept wicket in exactly three games for Tasmania the past two seasons, and has made one first-class century in a 12-year career.
He has been desperately unlucky with injury, and it will be a great story if he can take this chance. That doesn’t mean there was logic in the pick. The selectors used the fig leaf of two recent half-centuries – one in a net for England’s bowlers as they took apart a youth team, another as Tasmania piled on declaration runs against Victoria. Ironically, Tasmania only delayed the declaration in the hope of getting Wade a final hit, but Paine never got out.
The greatest morass of nonsense, as ever, came with picking Shaun Marsh to replace Glenn Maxwell at No6. Call him the Selectors’ Cat – Marsh is already up to life number eight.
To be fair, Marsh played a couple of top innings in India, then was left out for Bangladesh. There have been times when he hasn’t deserved to be dropped, but there hasn’t been a time when he has deserved to be picked. Said selectors, he’s “playing very well at the moment, having scored consistently in the JLT One-Day Cup and first three rounds of the JLT Sheffield Shield competition”.
Marsh made a hundred and three fifties in the one-day stuff. So did George Bailey. Marsh made three fifties in the Shield, Bailey made 106 and 59 in his last outing. Callum Ferguson followed an unbeaten 182 with 88 in whites, having piled up 50-over runs. Half a dozen others were in similar nick.
Ed Cowan didn’t get the chance to try. The top Shield run-scorer in the country over the past three seasons was ordered out of the New South Wales side by Australian captain Steve Smith. Younger players were a chance for a Test gig, was Smith’s acknowledgement, but never Cowan. Likewise, Victoria ditched Cameron White, while an unwanted Michael Klinger left Perth to play in the Bangladesh Premier League.
Cowan and Bailey are 35, White 34, Klinger 37, Ferguson 32. None were ever in the frame, seen as has-beens whose chance has gone. Yet the new Test No6 is 34, and his chances never end. For Marsh, selectors will ignore his age and point to his state form. For any other, they’ll point to his age and ignore his runs.
Poor old Maxwell. The incumbent, with a fighting maiden century in India earlier this year. To Marsh’s three Shield fifties, Maxwell made two and a 45 not out, grinding a draw from 115 balls to show the versatility requested. Aged 29, one of the most talented ball-strikers of a generation has never played a home Test.
This is a criminal waste, on the pitches that produce his best cricket. It was a waste last summer, when the spot was handed to a struggling Nic Maddinson, then on to gut-feeling choice Hilton Cartwright. This summer, it’s another waste by handing it to a player about whom nothing more can be learned.
It looks like the fear of an Ashes loss got Australia’s selectors spooked. If my career relied on Shaun Marsh’s batting, I’d be worried, but he’s seen as a safe pick while Maxwell is a risk. But whatever the reasoning, it’s never adequately explained.
People don’t like being misled. What we keep getting is a lack of transparency, a lack of accountability and a mentality of jobs for the old boys. It doesn’t just annoy fans, it messes with the lives of players. Careers stutter and sputter out, as old boys look after the new. But the very existence of boys’ clubs is under threat. The world is changing: gradually in the main, then with occasional rushes of subsidence. You can’t beat erosion. You can only move ahead of the fall.


Danica Patrick broke down in tears Friday as she announced she will retire from full-time racing next year after running the Daytona 500 and then the Indianapolis 500, closing her career at the storied track that made her famous.
Patrick told the Associated Press it took her many months to come to the realization her career is all but over. Once she accepted it, the idea of ending her career at Indianapolis Motor Speedway popped into her head.
She told her agent, and she’s been working on putting together “The Danica Double” over the last several weeks.
“Nothing that was being presented excited me, then about three weeks ago, I just blurted out, ’What about Indy? Let’s end it with the Indy 500,’” she said. “This ignites something in me. But I am done after May. Everyone needs to put their mind there. My plan is to be at Indy, and then I’m done.”
Patrick would not reveal who she will drive for in either race next year, but Chip Ganassi Racing is the likely ride at Indy.
Ganassi has room to field additional cars – he’s scaling down from four full-time cars to two next year – and would give Patrick a car capable of winning. Roger Penske and Michael Andretti both have full lineups announced for next year’s Indy 500.
Patrick will not be driving in the Daytona 500 for Stewart-Haas Racing, team co-owner Tony Stewart told AP. Patrick moved from IndyCar to Nascar after the 2011 season, and has been racing Cup cars for SHR since 2012. She is being replaced after Sunday’s season finale at Homestead-Miami Speedway by Aric Almirola.
Patrick is the only woman to have led laps in both the Daytona 500 and the Indianapolis 500. Patrick ran the Indy 500 from 2005 through 2011. Her highest finish was third in 2009, and she was the first woman to lead laps in the race when she paced the field for 19 trips around the Brickyard as a rookie.
Patrick was highly marketable early in her career even if success on the track was rare. She won the pole for the Daytona 500 in 2013, but finished 24th in the standings the last two seasons. She won her only IndyCar race in 2008, in Japan.
Sponsorship trouble surfaced this year, too. When no strong opportunities for next season presented itself, Patrick decided to call it a career at Indy next Memorial Day weekend.
“I think it’s awesome and it will make for a huge month of May that she’s back there,” said Stewart, who spent half of his career trying to win the Indy 500. “It would be really cool to see her face on the Borg-Warner Trophy, if she can pull that off.”
Patrick had been adamant she would never return to IndyCar or the 500, but changed her mind as she realized her competitive options were dwindling.
“I know I always said I’d never go back to Indy, and I was always being honest,” she said. “Well, things change. I know now you can never say never. I’d been going through this in my head and kept asking myself, ‘How am I going to get the words out and say it’s over?’ And trust me, I lost my (stuff) a few times over that.
“But this seems right, and this seems good.”
Patrick told AP she had only informed about 10 people of her decision prior to Friday’s announcement, where she wept openly as her family watched nearby. Everyone had been extremely happy with the path she’s chosen. She said longtime boyfriend Ricky Stenhouse Jr. “has never been more excited about something about me in his life.”
Stewart praised Patrick for her time at SHR, and said his team would never have expanded to four cars without her assistance. Kevin Harvick will try to win a second championship in four years for the organization on Sunday, and Stewart said Patrick has been a huge part of the team’s success.
He was disappointed to learn she’s ready to stop driving.
“I am happy that she is doing it on her terms, but I am sad because I feel like there are wins under her belt that she can still get,” he told AP. “I thought she’d go road racing or back to IndyCar or something along those lines, because I think that’s where she can be successful.”
Patrick’s fame was launched in IndyCar, and her relationship with former sponsor GoDaddy made her one of the most recognizable female athletes in the world. She currently has a winery in California, a line of athletic wear and an exercise and fitness program. Patrick said she’ll have more time to spend on those ventures after the Indy 500.
Her career crossroads was put in motion when GoDaddy first left auto racing after 2015, then new sponsor Nature’s Bakery was unable to fulfill its three-year commitment to SHR and Patrick. The team has pieced together sponsorship all year, but has sponsorship for Almirola next year that made Patrick expendable.
“I didn’t want to be pushed into anything, and everyone can relate, sometimes things just shift and change around you,” she told AP. “Especially with me and the sponsor situation. I’ve never been there before. I’ve always had a sponsor. It forces you into thinking about things and nothing was lining up easily. If I don’t feel like I can run better than where I am, then I don’t want to do it. And, there have been times that I could not have been more miserable.
“That’s not why I come, and I feel like it takes away from everything else I accomplished. I don’t want to be remembered for the things that didn’t go as well. I want to be remembered for the things that went well.”


The Four Nations Chess League (4NCL) began its new season at Telford last weekend where it left off, with a new demonstration of Guildford’s supremacy. The Surrey team, replete with grandmasters, took their opening matches by 8-0 and 7.5-0.5 and have now won 46 matches in a row in a sequence stretching back to 2012-13.
The solitary dropped half point was by GM Matthew Sadler against IM Peter Roberson. It was ironic that Sadler, the only one of England’s world top 100 sextet absent from the European team championship disaster in Crete, should experience relative failure on a weekend when his defeated colleagues bounced back. Gawain Jones and David Howell were successful in Telford, while Michael Adams and Luke McShane were winners in simultaneously played German Bundesliga matches.
In contrast the rising star IM Alan Merry, 21, who recently qualified to take on the big guns in next month’s British knockout championship, had a weekend to forget. He lost to IM Sophie Milliet, who although a six-time French women’s champion, is Guildford’s No2 woman after the former world champion Antoaneta Stefanova. Merry’s second defeat came as IM Harriet Hunt, still ranked England’s No1 woman although largely inactive, showed her continuing strength in a long game.
Detractors of the 4NCL used to say that it was really just a South and Midlands English affair with a few token Welsh extras but this criticism has gone up in smoke in recent seasons. Liverpool’s Spirit of Atticus have joined White Rose and 3Cs Oldham in the top flight while Northeast England are early Division Two leaders.
The all-Scotland Alba squad, after winning Divisions Three and Two with 100% scores, made an inauspicious debut in the top flight, losing both matches. They will probably avoid relegation but reinforcements are needed to make waves at the top.
South Wales Dragons used to be perennial relegation candidates but, with their original player core but merged with West is Best and with the Devon IM Jack Rudd on top board, they have made a good start. Ambitious Gonzaga Dublin are still down in Division Three but can call on several top Irish players and are likely to follow Alba to the top.
The most intriguing non-English team have to be Manx Liberty, odds-on favourites to be Division Two champions. They include some club players from the Isle of Man plus the German IM Dietmar Kolbus who works there, but their strength is the East European GMs on the top boards.
They are the nucleus of Trier, who were eighth from 16 in the 2016-17 Bundesliga but then had a dispute with the league management. Trier has effectively decamped to the 4NCL, and has its eyes on Guildford’s prized title in 2018-19! It is as if Borussia Dortmund or Bayer Leverkusen entered the English football Championship with designs on promotion.
The Bundesliga is a much stronger competition, where several teams field 2700-rated elite GMs. Last weekend even Anatoly Karpov played, but the former world champion is now aged 66 and lost rather tamely to China’s Li Chao.
Another Bundesliga top board is the English IM Lawrence Trent, best known as a prolific online commentator, who hopes for his first GM norm but became a victim of a fast rising young Russian when an opening blunder cost a piece.

World Rugby was left embarrassed and in disarray on Wednesday night after France was announced as the surprise host of the 2023 Rugby World Cup, prompting accusations of horse-trading and a power struggle at the heart of the sport’s governing body.
The outcome of the secret ballot casts a huge shadow over World Rugby’s decision to commission a painstaking evaluation report, which last month recommended South Africa as the “clear leader”, only for its council to throw its weight behind France two weeks later.
It is also a devastating blow to the World Rugby hierarchy, including the chairman, Bill Beaumont, after the 139-page report was published in the interests of transparency and to avoid accusations of the kind of political lobbying that has tarnished similar processes in football and Olympic circles. While it has been rife over the past two weeks, it is understood infighting at the centre of World Rugby also significantly contributed to France’s win.
France obtained 18 votes in the first round to South Africa’s 13, with Ireland eliminated, having received eight. France then triumphed 24 to 15 in the second round and it is understood World Rugby council members have grown concerned at the amount of power wielded by Beaumont, his vice-chairman Agustîn Pichot and the chief executive Brett Gosper, and seized the opportunity to flex their muscles by snubbing the recommendation.
South Africa received only a third of the council’s 39 votes in the first round, with England believed to be the only tier-one nation to back Ireland, then supporting France in the second round.
“Humiliation for me? I don’t think so. I don’t think so at all,” said a defiant Beaumont, who, as a former chairman and a former England captain, would have hoped for the Rugby Football Union to back South Africa. “Just because it went to France, that doesn’t mean there’s humiliation whatsoever. I think it was a very fair process and a transparent process. Countries will have disagreed with the scoring and that is obvious. You can’t blame them for that.”

South Africa hit out at a process described by its union’s chief executive, Jurie Roux, as “exhaustive and transparent for 15 months” only to go “entirely opaque for the past two weeks”. Mark Alexander, the South African union’s president, accused World Rugby’s council members of “breaking the rules” and its code of conduct after an ugly fortnight of recriminations, claims and counterclaims from France and Ireland over the validity of the report.
“There was a set of rules and we abided by those rules up to today,” Alexander said. “Several rules were broken during that process, which we are upset about. This is the first time ever World Rugby has got a recommendation and it has been voted against. South African rugby did not attack any of the other bidders throughout the process. It is disappointing – we have a set of rules and we have to stick to the rules.”
France struck a triumphant note after being awarded a tournament it hosted only 10 years ago. The union’s president, Bernard Laporte, has been waging war against World Rugby’s recommendation that he described as “nonsense and full of errors” over the past two weeks but spearheaded a charm offensive since then. Laporte has lobbied hard to convince council members of a bid that pledged a £500m guarantee to World Rugby, including £350m for reinvestment. “We did dispute some aspects but I’m not saying that’s why we won,” he said.
South Africa’s support came from Australia, New Zealand, Argentina – in a show of Sanzaar solidarity – and Wales, because the WRU chairman, Gareth Davies, was on the subcommittee that recommended the evaluation. South Africa did not even get the backing of the African continental association.
France was backed by the majority of the continental associations, including Africa, as well as Scotland and Italy. Ireland was largely limited to English and the North American vote and the IRFU chief executive, Philip Browne, admitted his frustration at a failure to gain the backing of all the home nations. “We are very disappointed they didn’t vote for us,” he said. “Scotland went for the money and Wales went out of solidarity with Gareth Davies, England supported us and we have to thank England for that.”
Browne acknowledged France’s finances had proved pivotal and questioned whether nations such as Ireland, or the 2011 host, New Zealand, would have been selected again under the current process. “The reality is that unless you have big shiny new stadia you have to wonder why you would bid,” he said. “World Rugby need to decide what sort of tournament they want and make sure everyone understands what their vision is at the outset.”
Beaumont conceded the bidding process will almost certainly be changed. “Should there have been a recommendation? We’ll look at all these things in a debrief,” he said.


A 14-month investigation. Thirty‑seven witness interviews. A significant hit on the UK Anti‑Doping Agency budget. Yet still we are no closer to knowing whether the package delivered to Sir Bradley Wiggins at the Critérium du Dauphiné in 2011 contained a legal decongestant or a banned drug. Or to hearing from a key witness, Dr Richard Freeman, whose illness seems to have provoked a nine-month silence worthy of a monk.
But we can be sure of this: few parties come out well from the Ukad investigation, which was closed on Wednesday. Not Team Sky or British Cycling, whose response to the initial claims the five‑times Olympic champion had been administered with the powerful corticosteroid triamcinolone in competition, was confusing and unclear. And certainly not Freeman, whose lack of basic medical record keeping had the fortunate consequence of Ukad dropping its case. All parties, including Wiggins, have been left in an uneasy limbo, not damned or cleared. Yet.
Ukad, too, is diminished by this result. It is a defeat for the organisation, make no mistake about it. On Tuesday the sports minister, Tracey Crouch, promised parliament that it was one of the best anti-doping agencies in the world. Yet 24 hours later those platitudes looked as hollow as a drum. If an anti‑doping agency cannot successfully carry out big investigations, then we should legitimately ask what is its purpose?
Earlier this week, Ukad made a lot of noise about banning a 60-year-old amateur cyclist for a positive test after he came 95th in a local race. But in reality that was the equivalent of a striker going wild over a goal in a pre‑season friendly against a Sunday league outfit. Stuff like that does not matter. It is doing it in the big games that counts. Ukad has also set worrying precedent by terminating its investigation because of a lack of medical records as it could become a get-out-of-jail card for others.
Most of all, this was a stark reminder of us how flimsy Ukad’s resources are. Incredibly it has only two investigators, the equivalent to a quiet village police station. And no powers to access medical and financial records, conduct video surveillance, or apply the squeeze.
No wonder some believe that dopers – and those who aid them – should face criminal charges. This year Nicole Cooke, the 2008 Olympic road race champion, told parliament that only the actions of the Italian police, who had such powers, led to the arrest of her directeur sportif William Dazzani, who she claimed had offered her performance-enhancing drugs when she was a young rider.
Yet when addressing the anti-doping situation in the UK, Cooke was damning. As she told parliament: “The measures and schemes to fight the abuse of performance-enhancing drugs are inadequate and ineffective – [it’s] the wrong people fighting the wrong war, in the wrong way, with the wrong tools.”
The government and Ukad are against criminalisation for a number of reasons – including the fact the burden of proof in criminal courts is higher and it takes longer for cases to get to court – and there would be no chance of getting primary legislation through a parliament mired in Brexit. Clearly, however, anti-doping agencies need more powers. At the moment they come to a gun fight with a pea-shooter.
A tailored review into Ukad, announced by Crouch in March into its efficiency, effectiveness and governance will no doubt consider whether it needs more money to do its job. But there is a catch-22 at work here. Why give an anti-doping organisation more money when it has not proven effective with the budget it has got already?
Meanwhile, as the chair of the digital, culture, media and sport select committee Damian Collins has rightly pointed out, it would be wrong to allow Sky and British Cycling off the hook.
Remember the Team Sky principal, Dave Brailsford, wrongly claimed the British Cycling courier Simon Cope had not travelled to France to deliver that package to Wiggins but to see Emma Pooley – an explanation that quickly unravelled when it was revealed she was competing in Spain.
Brailsford also said Wiggins and Freeman had not been together on the Team Sky bus at the Dauphiné – only for video evidence to prove they were. It also took weeks for Team Sky to state the package for Wiggins contained the legal decongestant Fluimucil. Before then Brailsford had also tried to persuade the Daily Mail to bury the story because he feared it could mark “the end of Team Sky” while the head of Ukad, Nicole Sapstead, told parliament her investigators had met with “resistance” in their inquiries.
Brailsford’s former No2 Shane Sutton told parliament that Wiggins was treated at the Dauphiné “for a long‑term illness”, saying he had allergies for years, before changing his mind and saying it was possibly a chest infection.
As far as British Cycling is concerned, do not forget Ukad have been unable to establish why products containing testosterone were delivered to its premises.
Even Wiggins’s statement in response to Ukad closing his case was unsatisfactory. On the one hand, he criticised the medical team around him for not doing their jobs and keeping proper records. On the other, he praised Freeman. Like a lot of things about this case, it does not quite add up.


The familiar colours of the late Alan Potts will be much in evidence at Cheltenham this weekend after a decision by his family to let his racehorses follow their established plans in the wake of his death. Potts, who died on Tuesday at the age of 80, had built up a collection of dozens of quality jumps racehorses, many of which have long been aimed at races to be staged in the next few weeks.
“We can run them all, so we will,” said Joe Tizzard, whose father, Colin, trains Potts’s British-based horses and has 13 of them entered in various races at Cheltenham over the next three days. There was some initial doubt from Tizzard Sr on Wednesday over whether he would be allowed to race the Potts horses but the way is now clear for stars such as Finian’s Oscar and Fox Norton to line up at the home of jump racing.
Speaking in the winner’s enclosure here after greeting the impressive novice hurdler White Moon, Tizzard Jr said: “I spoke to Dad to tell him this one had won and he said we’ve been given the all-clear to run the horses this weekend. So that’s what we’ll do.
“We’ll certainly be running them because they’ve been planned out for this weekend. Alan was due to come to our place Thursday night and see the yard, then go to Cheltenham. It’s a real shock that he’s no longer with us.”
Potts’s daughter, Julie, is believed to share in the family enthusiasm for jumps racing, to the extent of having led some of his runners around the paddock before their races. She appears set to inherit one of the best-quality strings of jumps horses in Britain and Ireland, including the Gold Cup winner Sizing John, based in Ireland with Jessica Harrington.
The Tizzards expect to run Viconte Du Noyer in this weekend’s big race, the BetVictor Gold Cup, while Finian’s Oscar will have his second run over fences on Friday or Sunday. The classy Fox Norton is favourite for Sunday’s Shloer Chase. Sizing Codelco is one of the few with an entry this weekend who might not take it up, as the trainer is also considering next month’s Becher Chase for him. Bryan Cooper is expected to remain as the principal jockey for the English-based horses. “That’s how Alan wanted it, so it’ll stay like that,” Tizzard Jr said.
Yanworth, the big-name horse on this card, let his backers down by falling at an early stage of his novice chase, which was just his second run over fences. Sent off the well-supported favourite at odds of 2-9, the chestnut came down at the seventh of the 15 fences despite having comfortably cleared the obstacle. “He got a little bit high behind and just crumbled on landing,” reported his jockey, Barry Geraghty. “Just a novicey error. Those fences, they just run a little bit downhill and he just got on his forehand. It’s all part of learning.”
It was an unwelcome setback for Yanworth’s trainer, Alan King, whose horses have often run well without winning in the past fortnight. It typified his recent fortunes that his fancied runner in the last race, Chosen Path, had his jockey knocked from the saddle by another horse.
“He seems fine,” a resigned King said of Yanworth. “It’s just one of those thing. He was a bit gassy and landed a bit steeply.”

A former Argentinian football official killed himself just hours after he was accused of taking bribes by a witness in the New York corruption trial examining endemic misconduct at world football’s governing body, Fifa.
Jorge Delhon, 52, a lawyer who worked for Argentina’s Football for All, a government programme that holds the broadcast rights to domestic football in the country, was accused of accepting annual $500,000 (£380,000) bribes from 2011 to 2014.
The sworn allegations were made by Alejandro Burzaco, an influential former sports marketing executive, who has pleaded guilty to corruption charges and has been assisting US authorities in the sprawling investigation into Fifa.
Burzaco claimed to have agreed the bribes with Delhon and another Argentinian official to receive broadcast rights to domestic club competitions. Shortly after he made the allegations in court on Tuesday, police in Buenos Aires announced that Delhon had killed himself.
The trial of three former South American football executives continued on Wednesday. As Burzaco prepared to give a second day of testimony, he broke down in tears on the witness stand and was escorted from the courtroom.
Lawyers for Juan Ángel Napout, the Paraguayan former president of South American football’s governing body, Conmebol, accused someone in the courtroom of “staring down” the former executive.
Napout, Manuel Burga, the former head of the Peruvian football association, and José Maria Marin, the head of Brazil’s football confederation, all deny multiple counts of racketeering, wire fraud and money laundering.
As Wednesday’s proceedings commenced, Burzaco continued to give details of how he orchestrated multimillion-dollar bribe payments to obtain the exclusive marketing rights to the Copa América tournament, contested between national teams, for a company, Datisa, created to house a group of rival sports marketing corporations, including Burzaco’s own Torneos y Competencias.
Burzaco said he had agreed to pay $16.5m to a group of senior Conmebol officials to secure the rights. The deal allowed Datisa the rights to the 2015 tournament and the next two editions of the event. The $16.5m bribe payment would be repeated for the next two Copa Americas, and the contract would allow Datisa first refusal for rights in the future.
The Argentinian national, who turned himself in to authorities weeks after a May 2015 morning raid on a hotel in Zurich unveiled the federal investigation into Fifa, said the Copa América contract was finalised during a trip to London in May 2013.
Burzaco said he had travelled to the UK for the Champions League final, which was held at Wembley Stadium, and met with a number of Conmebol officials at venues including the Waldorf Hilton hotel and a restaurant in Mayfair, in an attempt to get their signatures for the new contract.
Burzaco recalled the details of one meeting at the Waldorf with Marin and Marco Polo Del Nero, a Fifa executive and now the current president of the Brazilian football confederation. The pair, who were due to receive $3m in bribes for the first Copa América, were angry they had not yet been paid a separate $2m annual bribe for the rights to the top South American club tournament, the Copa Libertadores. The bribes, Burzaco said were “normally paid in the first six months of the year” but had not yet reached the two officials.
The Copa Libertadores annual bribe was later paid to the two, Burzaco said.
Burzaco’s evidence has implicated a host of influential football officials for taking multiple bribes in exchange for marketing rights to regional competitions. Burzaco has also said well known sports broadcasters, including Fox Sports, paid bribes to football officials. Fox Sports denies wrongdoing.
On Tuesday Burzaco, alleged that Julio Grondona, the late former head of the Argentinian FA and a senior vice-president at Fifa, had taken at least $1m in bribes to vote for Qatar to host the 2022 World Cup.
The trial is expected to last up to six weeks.

The Scottish Football Association has requested talks with Michael O’Neill and Sunderland are also interested. It remains a long shot for now that the man who oversaw Northern Ireland’s run to Euro 2016 and a World Cup play-off would take the job at the Stadium of Light.
The USA are also understood to want to speak to O’Neill about taking charge of their international side – a highly lucrative post. O’Neill’s brother is based in Chicago.
With Scotland seeking a successor to Gordon Strachan, the country’s governing body made initial contact with the Irish FA on Tuesday and is awaiting an answer on whether it can talk to O’Neill.
The 48-year-old has always been Scotland’s favoured candidate – with Aberdeen’s Derek McInnes also highly regarded – but the matter was complicated by Northern Ireland’s World Cup qualifying progress. O’Neill is also under contract until 2020. Although there is no set compensation figure should he move to a different international post, another governing body would need to negotiate with the IFA relating to the value of a notice period.
The IFA, which is yet to comment, will take time to formally consider Scotland’s request, during which time it is set to piece together an enhanced contract package in an attempt to retain O’Neill, who earns £600,000 per year, plus qualification bonuses.
Although the Scottish FA is unlikely to offer a wage much higher than that – Strachan was paid £500,000 a year – it is likely to offer sizeable incentive to lead Scotland to a place in Euro 2020.
Sources close to O’Neill, who lives in Edinburgh, have stressed he will take time to consider what is a key career decision and have played down the notion he has his mind set on a switch to Scotland. Personal circumstances also dictate the man who managed Shamrock Rovers will not hold discussions with anybody before next week. The Scottish FA has been irked by the O’Neill approach becoming public, with that inevitably increasing pressure on the association to secure its man.
Martin Bain, the Sunderland chief executive, hopes the challenge of waking up one of English football’s doziest sleeping giants – the team are bottom of the Championship – and taking them back into the Premier League will appeal to O’Neill but wants to determine whether he has the appetite for the daily grind of club football. O’Neill will be aware McInnes turned down Sunderland in the summer, since which time their troubles intensified under Simon Grayson.
Should the move for O’Neill founder, Paul Heckingbottom could well end up as the sacked Grayson’s successor. Although Barnsley have not yet received an approach for Heckingbottom, they are expecting one. The 40-year-old, who rebuffed an offer from Nottingham Forest in the summer, is understood to be interested in moving to Sunderland, not least because he could expect to quadruple his salary to £400,000.
O’Neill would be more expensive but Sunderland – who have also interviewed the former Rangers manager Ally McCoist – are likely to pay if they feel the Northern Ireland manager really wants the job. He would, however, have to do so without a huge transfer budget; significantly, the club’s financial restraints are thought to have put Aitor Karanka, the former Middlesbrough manager, off the vacancy. Ideally, Bain would like a manager in place in time for Saturday’s home game against Millwall but is prepared to take his time in order to secure the right one.
Should Northern Ireland need a new manager, St Johnstone’s Tommy Wright would be the clear favourite.


After a qualification process involving 209 national teams and lasting more than two years, the list of 32 sides who will be in the December draw for the 2018 World Cup is almost complete. Here is the full list of who is in:
Qualified: Russia (hosts); Belgium, Germany, England, Spain, Poland, Serbia, Iceland, France, Portugal; Switzerland, Croatia, Sweden, Denmark (via play-offs)
The group stage draw will take place on Friday 1 December (3pm GMT/6pm local) at the State Kremlin Palace in Moscow. Organisers promise a 'colourful show representing local culture' before the balls are drawn.
Hosts Russia will be seeded in Group A. The 31 qualifiers will be split into four pots, based on the October world rankings. Teams from the same confederation will be kept apart – although a maximum of two Uefa sides can be drawn together.
Pot 1: Russia (hosts, Group A), Germany, Brazil, Portugal, Argentina, Belgium, Poland, France.
Pot 2: Spain, Peru, Switzerland, England, Colombia, Mexico, Uruguay, Croatia.
Pot 3: Denmark, Iceland, Costa Rica, Sweden, Tunisia, Egypt, Senegal, Iran.
Pot 4: Serbia, Nigeria, Australia, Japan, Morocco, Panama, South Korea, Saudi Arabia.
It's best not to presume anything with England but a group with, say, Brazil, Iceland and Nigeria would look more daunting than facing Poland, Tunisia and Saudi Arabia. You can test the permutations for yourself with our interactive draw simulator.
2010 winners Spain are somehow in pot two and will be the ones to avoid for all the top seeds. There are only two debutants in Iceland and Panama but three teams have qualified for the first time this century – Peru (first since 1982), Egypt (1990) and Morocco (1998). Or if you like an underdog, how about backing the current lowest-ranked team? It's the hosts, Russia.
Russia qualified automatically as hosts, and were joined by Belgium on 3 September when Roberto Martínez’s side beat Greece 2-1 in Piraeus. Belgium finished Group H nine points clear of Greece, who snatched a play-off spot with victory over Gibraltar. The defending champions, Germany, booked their place with a 3-1 win over Northern Ireland in Belfast, finishing Group C with 10 wins out of 10.
England were far less spectacular but also went unbeaten in Group F and sealed their trip to Russia with victory over Slovenia on 5 October. Slovakia missed the play-offs as the runners-up with the worst record. Spain, who followed victory in 2010 with an early exit in 2014, were back to their best in racing through Group G, winning nine of their 10 matches as Italy were forced into the play-offs.
Poland were seeded third in Group E but saw off Romania and second-placed Denmark to reach their first World Cup since 2006. Serbia also emerged from pot three to take an automatic place, edging through with victory over Georgia in their final Group D match. Republic of Ireland headed to the play-offs after their 1-0 win in Cardiff meant they leapfrogged Wales.
Group I was the most competitive, with four teams still chasing automatic qualification with two games to go. Iceland’s away win over Turkey and home victory against Kosovo saw them become the smallest country to reach a World Cup finals. Croatia won their final game in Ukraine to make the play-offs.
France progressed from Group A despite a memorable draw at home to Luxembourg. Holland were expected to compete for top spot but missed the play-offs, with Sweden sneaking in despite defeat in Amsterdam. In Group B, Switzerland won their first nine qualifiers but lost in Lisbon to hand top spot to Portugal after a dramatic two-horse race.
Italy will miss the World Cup finals for the first time since 1958 after a 1-0 aggregate loss to Sweden. The azzurri slumped to a one-goal defeat in Stockholm and could not find a way through at the San Siro. Switzerland also held onto a one-goal lead in their second leg with Northern Ireland after winning 1-0 in Belfast thanks to a highly controversial penalty.
Croatia put one foot in the final with a 4-1 home win over Greece in the first leg, and held on comfortably in another scoreless second leg. Denmark took the final European place, rallying from a goalless first leg and early setback in Dublin to thrash Republic of Ireland 5-1 in their play-off second leg.

Qualified: Brazil, Uruguay, Argentina, Colombia, Peru (via play-offs)
Brazil became the first team to qualify for Russia during a nine-game winning run, putting their 2014 nightmare behind them. Uruguay looked odds-on for qualification for much of their campaign but it took a final-round victory over Bolivia to make certain.
Argentina have had their close calls in qualifying before but left it late even by their standards. They travelled to Ecuador needing to win but went behind after 37 seconds. Enter Lionel Messi, whose hat-trick carried Jorge Sampaoli’s team to Russia after Chile lost in Brazil to miss out altogether.
Paraguay’s 1-0 home defeat to Venezuela ended their hopes, leaving Peru and Colombia battling for fourth place in Lima. A 1-1 draw meant the visitors qualified automatically while Peru, chasing their first World Cup appearance since 1982, finished fifth and went into a play-off against New Zealand.
Qualified: Mexico, Costa Rica, Panama
Mexico cruised through the six-team final group and never looked in danger of missing out after beating the USA in Columbus in the first game. Costa Rica have also qualified but not without late drama as Kendall Waston’s 95th-minute penalty got the point they needed against Honduras.
USA struggled throughout their campaign and fell 2-1 down to Trinidad & Tobago in their final game. That meant a Panama win over Costa Rica would see them into their first World Cup, and Román Torres struck with only two minutes left. USA dropped to fifth in the table, missing their first finals since 1986, after Honduras fought back to beat Mexico and claim a play-off place, in which they lost out to Australia over two legs.
Qualified: Iran, Japan, South Korea, Saudi Arabia, Australia (via play-offs)
Iran were the first Asian team to qualify, and did so way back in June with a 2-0 win over Uzbekistan. Carlos Queiroz’s side topped the group with maximum efficiency – going unbeaten with 10 goals in 10 games. South Korea came second in Group A to secure their ninth consecutive appearance at a World Cup finals.
In Group B, a tight three-way battle ended with Japan topping the group, one point ahead of Saudi Arabia who qualified after edging out Australia on goal difference. The Socceroos narrowly prevailed in a two-legged play-off with surprise package Syria, before getting the better of Honduras to ultimately seal their place in Russia.
Qualified: Nigeria, Egypt, Senegal, Tunisia, Morocco
Morocco are back at a World Cup finals for the first time since France ‘98 after an unbeaten campaign ended with a 2-0 win over nearest rivals Ivory Coast. Goals from Nabil Dirar and Mehdi Benatia sealed victory in Abidjan, while Tunisia squeezed through with a 0-0 draw against Libya, denying DR Congo in Group A.
Senegal won 2-0 in South Africa to seal their first finals appearance since 2002, in a game that was replayed after the referee in the first fixture was suspended. Nigeria dominated a tough group containing Zambia, Cameroon and a disappointing Algeria side to reach the finals for the sixth time.
Egypt complete a strong North African contingent – the Pharoahs sealed qualification with a dramatic late win over Congo for their first World Cup appearance since 1990. In the interim, they have won the Africa Cup of Nations four times.
Qualified: Australia, Peru
Honduras, Peru and Australia earned another chance at qualification alongside Oceania winners New Zealand. The first legs both ended goalless, giving Peru and Australia an advantage ahead of the second legs. In Sydney, a Mile Jedinak hat-trick ensured Australia a place in Russia at Honduras’s expense, while Jefferson Farfan and Christian Ramos goals in Lima booked Peru’s place in Russia.




England have selected three seamers for their warm-up match here, with Jimmy Anderson rested and Jake Ball recovering from a week-old sprained ankle. Although the pitch is much more sluggish than the quick deck at the Gabba and the opposition plenty poorer than Australia’s top order, those three seamers – particularly Chris Woakes but Stuart Broad and Craig Overton, too – stuck right to England’s plan of the first Test.
That plan has been devised by Shane Bond, the former New Zealand quick who might just want to win the Ashes more than most Englishmen do. “Everyone wants to beat Australia,” he says. “You want to be on the side versus Australia, no matter where you’re from. I want to beat these guys.”
Bond is with England until the end of the second Test, when he rejoins Brisbane Heat as bowling coach, working under his former international team-mate Daniel Vettori. Chris Silverwood will coach England’s fast bowlers soon but Bond has been briefly hired because of his expertise with the Kookaburra ball and understanding of Australian conditions.
“Sheez no,” is his response when asked if he will be doing anything technical with England’s quicks. His remit is tactical. “I’ve got a pretty good understanding of the way the game is played over here and it’s about instilling little bits of that in the guys,” says Bond, whose impact at international level was cruelly curtailed by a series of injuries. He managed only 18 Tests between 2001 and 2009 but picked up 87 wickets at 22.
“England play the game differently to what we do in this part of the world,” he says. “It’s about getting them to understand that. They need to understand what attacking looks like and align our strengths to different fields and match them up against their batsmen.”
So what does attacking look like? It might look rather defensive, actually. Broad has spoken on this tour about “swarming” Australia batsmen early in their innings, then retreating a touch. Joe Root has already employed some curious fielding positions, such as a closer catching point at the start of this match, while James Vince learned how busy life in the gully can be, with three fine catches, taken at speed. Bond says: “Joe and the analyst are doing some great work. By Brisbane we will have a very clear way of how we want to attack.”
Bond has recognised that England do not have bowlers of express pace – Woakes will be the swiftest, touching 88-90mph at his quickest – but do possess accuracy and skill, so it is about making it hard to score. England found lateral movement on day one here but it was never substantial. Locating even the slightest bit of seam or swing from the Kookaburra will be vital.
“The ball doesn’t move as much,” he says. “The pitches are harder. You have to set your fields differently. Listening to the boys about England, they know there’s always something in the wicket. Here, you won’t get that sideways movement or massive amounts of swing. If it swings it won’t be there all the time. You have to find different ways to skin a cat.
“Our bowlers are quality and they get bounce, which is massive. If we can get it to go off the straight just a little bit, we are accurate enough that we can cause trouble.”
With the exception of Anderson and Ball, the tourists were all over the shop in the opener in Perth – too full or too short and too English – but in Adelaide last week Woakes and Overton pulled their length back a touch and were excellent. Broad took only one wicket here on day one but was never easy to score off. “Today we were difficult to get away and created more chances than the nine we took and we were really consistent and testing,” Bond says. “Regardless of the opposition, we will be hard to beat if we do that.”
Bond sees England’s attack as a counterpoint to Australia’s, which will be pacier but shorter on street-smarts. “You know what you will get out of Australia,” he says. “[Mitchell] Starc will try to swing it back in and bowl over and across you, then go round the wicket and try to knock your off pole out. [Josh] Hazlewood will be accurate, then [Pat] Cummins will mix his length and bowl short. We are different. We have to control their run rate and chip away at their batting lineup, and take it to day five.”
Anderson is the smartest of all and Bond is enjoying discovering that coaches can learn from their students. “Hopefully I can give him little nudges about fields and the like,” he says. “But he’s a great of the game, so it’s great to see how he goes about his work, what makes him so good, and see what little subtleties I can learn from him.”


In this, a season in which Rory McIlroy took leave from social media after being subject to one insult too many, Tommy Fleetwood gleaned motivation from the same platform. He does not know who scoffed at the concept of him winning the Race to Dubai title; he does, however, admit this proved an incentive. Fleetwood is within touching distance of the last laugh.
“I remember seeing a tweet and somebody laughed at the thought of me winning, so that motivated me a bit more,” Fleetwood said. “Somebody had put: ‘Who do you think will win the Race to Dubai?’ I wasn’t included in the names listed and [the putting coach] Phil Kenyon said: ‘What about the current leader?’ and somebody laughed. To be fair, maybe it wasn’t all that wrong at the time. You see things all the time, don’t you, on social media. Little things like that always motivate you. I don’t remember who it was.”
So here we are, with four days of the European Tour season to play, and Fleetwood holds a lead of around €260,000 on Justin Rose in the order of merit table. Fleetwood, as is typical, was impressively confident and relaxedon Wednesday. “It will be a perfect way to end a year that’s been amazing,” the 26-year-old said. “It would mean a lot. There’s no denying it or getting away from it. There’s no saying, I just want to play my own game and not think about it. I think that’s just pretty much impossible.”
Fleetwood, who has enjoyed an extraordinary rise this year, was in no mood to play down the significance of the order of merit. “It’s funny, because you do look at individual events like the majors,” he said. “They are the ones everybody wants to win. I think it is a bit harsh that a lot of people’s careers are defined by four events, and the end of the day anybody can have a hot week with the putter and win. Over the course of a year it’s a lot more difficult and I think it does hold a lot of respect with your peers, having that consistency throughout a year.”
Fleetwood knows victory at the DP World Tour Championship will be enough to take the prize. Rose, of course, has aspirations of turning the tables. Sergio García will win the Race to Dubai only in the event of a tournament win while Fleetwood finishes outside the top four and Rose the top 20.
“It’s not intimidating or stressful in any way,” Fleetwood said. “I’m not sure nervous is the right word but it’s like the good kind of nerves where you’re trying to win the Race to Dubai. It’s not by any means a burden.
“It’s actually an amazing opportunity and it’s a massive privilege to be playing. I’m turning up tomorrow, final event of the year; I’m playing with Justin Rose trying to win a Race to Dubai. Sergio could win it, as well. Sergio, Justin Rose and then me, that’s pretty cool. This is just another test, another experience, and it’s something that’s going to make me a better golfer at the end of it, whether I do well or not.”
Asked whether theoretically he would bet on himself or Rose to prevail, Fleetwood did not waiver. “I would put my money on me,” he said. “Every day.”
Rose, who won the Race to Dubai a decade ago, has rebounded brilliantly in a year that could otherwise have been most notable for losing a play-off to García at the Masters. “I would still take Tommy’s chances,” Rose said. “There are no givens in golf. His lead is significant, it means I’ve got to play well.
“I didn’t want to be too far behind Tommy; that if he finished second, I still couldn’t win. So in some ways controlling my destiny from that point of view is important to me.
“I like the fact I don’t have to think about anybody else. Maybe Tommy does, there’s more scenarios in play that way whereas for me I think I can just focus on playing good golf and get to the top of the leaderboard. That’s as simple as I’m trying to keep it this week.
“To win the Race to Dubai I have to contend in this tournament one way or another. I need to finish towards the top end of the leaderboard, and if you’re going to finish at the top end, you may as well focus on trying to win the tournament.
“The objective it quite simple and quite clear from that point of view. But like I said, it’s Wednesday, it’s too early to think about winning. Thursday is too early to think about winning. Friday is too early to think about winning. It’s just about putting myself in position, and then getting it done when you have that chance.”


The Italian Football Federation has sacked Gian Piero Ventura as manager after the 1-0 aggregate defeat by Sweden in the World Cup play-offs meant the national team failed to qualify for the finals for the first time in 60 years.
In a statement on Wednesday night the Italian federation announced that the Ventura’s 16-month reign was over.
An inauspicious start to his tenure as his side are comprehensively second best in a friendly
A defence renowned for being tight is torn apart at the Bernabéu, with Isco scoring twice to leave Italy staring at the prospect of a play-off
Italy must win to have any chance of qualifying automatically but a lifeless display leads to the world's 85th best team equalising in the 77th minute, causing an eruption of booing at the final whistle in Turin
Italy lack invention and barely threaten the Sweden goal as a deflected Jakob Johansson strike is enough to leave Italy on the brink of missing out on Russia 2018
Italy have 75% of possession and 23 shots on goal but look predictable. With the score 0-0, they desperately need a goal but Ventura leaves the creative forward Lorenzo Insigne on the bench. The final whistle blows and Italy have lost 1-0 on aggregate. "Apocalypse, tragedy, catastrophe," says the Italian press
“At the meeting convened by the chairman, Carlo Tavecchio, which was attended by the presidents of the federal members a discussion was had following the failure of the national team to qualify for the 2018 World Cup,” the statement read.
“As a first point on the agenda, Tavecchio communicated a decision of the technical guidance committee, and to date, Gian Piero Ventura is no longer the national team head coach.”
The decision was taken shortly after a stormy meeting in which the Footballers’ Association president, Damiano Tommasi, walked out shortly after asking Tavecchio if he intended to resign. The answer was no.
The 69-year-old Ventura said after the Sweden match: “I apologise for the result but not for the effort and hard work. I do realise the result is the most important thing.”
A decision is yet to be taken on who will succeed Ventura , with Tavecchio telling reporters after the meeting that the federation have been “thinking of important names” to replace Ventura. Carlo Ancelotti, out of work since being sacked by Bayern Munich earlier this season, is the early favourite for the role. Chelsea manager Antonio Conte, Roberto Mancini, currently in charge of Zenit St Petersburg, and Juventus coach Massimiliano Allegri are the other names reportedly in the frame.


When Rafael Nadal signed off early from the ATP World Tour Finals this week with a hearty: “Thank you, and merry Christmas everyone,” it was tempting to shout out after the Spaniard as he limped home to the warmth and comfort of the Spanish sunshine: “And thanks for coming.”
It was the sixth time in 14 qualifications for this event that Nadal’s body has given up on him – the previous five of those before a ball was hit – and few players are more committed to the cause than the muscular Mallorcan. So, he should not be castigated for giving what little he had and he will be missed. But his departure certainly sucked the life out of the O2 Arena, hosting this season-ending cash bonanza for the eighth year, with at least three more to come.
However, this gig is as demanding as nearly any in sport, not so much because of the format or even the hard court that Nadal struggles with, but because of the accumulated workload the eight finalists have to bear to get here.
Nadal was never going to go deeper than a couple of days’ play this year, having withdrawn after two matches in Paris, the week before, with a recurrence of his chronic knee pain. But there are sponsors to please, tickets to sell, eyeballs to log, digital clicks to click.
The event was already missing its champion, Andy Murray, as well as Novak Djokovic, Stan Wawrinka, Kei Nishikori and Milos Raonic. They all chose or had imposed on them a rest for the remainder of the 2017 season because their bodies said no, even if their bank managers whispered yes.
The fans, however, continue to flock to the O2 Arena, even if they suspect their favourites are less than 100% fit to entertain them. It is a chance to see eight days of potentially excellent tennis, with 17,500 packed into a magnificent setting in each of the day and nightly sessions from Sunday to Sunday.
This year, they have had to make do – although only a curmudgeon would complain about the replacement dish. There are four first-time qualifiers: the exciting world No3, Alexander Zverev; the dashing Grigor Dimitrov; the American with the quick wits and big serve, Jack “Showtime” Sock; and David Goffin, who played one match last year as an alternate. Nevertheless, they are not Rafa, Andy, Novak or Stan – or even Kei or Milos, whose stars shine not quite as brightly as that bankable quartet.
Generally, the contests this week have been competitive – although Dimitrov, back to his zestful best this season after too long wondering about his muted gifts, bagelled the exhausted Goffin, his left knee heavily taped, on the way to a one-sided 6-0, 6-2 win in 73 minutes on Wednesday afternoon. It was Goffin who outlasted Nadal two days previously.
Dimitrov, the first semi-finalist from his group, said courtside after a blistering performance: “You get a few days out of the year where everything you touch turns to gold. But I work for those days. It’s very nice when they come on such an occasion. It’s a special win for me. My movement was great, I was reading the game pretty well, getting a lot of returns back in court. I thought I could have played longer, which is great. I’m not here just to participate.”
Dimitrov, the first Bulgarian to make it into the final eight, said of the tournament: “It is not only big for me, but big for the whole country.” Goffin, also, is flying the flag, if a little limply – the first Belgian to qualify in the 47 years of the men’s end-of-season event in its various guises. It matters.
A few hours after Dimitrov’s win, Dominic Thiem beat Pablo Carreno-Busta 6-3, 3-6, 6-4.
There is no reason to believe the partnership the ATP chief executive, Chris Kermode, negotiated with Nitto this year to replace Barclays will not be a fruitful one. But the event also will be fraught on occasions. For all its thrills and spills, for all that it is a lovely game to watch, tennis demands a lot of its warriors.


The minarets of Red Square are finally visible on the horizon after the longest, windiest qualifying road in World Cup history concluded in Sydney on Wednesday night.
Bookended by goals from the boot of Mile Jedinak, it’s not been the prettiest 29 months of qualification football, but it has at least proved effective. Back in June 2015 Australia left Kyrgyzstan with a 2-1 victory, the first of 22 matches that have taken the Socceroos to all corners of Asia, around Australia, and finally across the Pacific and back. Much of this has been hard-going, for players, coaches and fans alike.
Like much of the qualifying campaign, the decider against Honduras was a nervous affair with little for aesthetes to admire. For 54 minutes ANZ Stadium was a study in anxiety – coaches too agitated to sit down, players too eager to time a tackle, and fans, the poor tormented fans, burned at similar moments in previous sudden death scenarios, waiting expectantly for chances that never came.
Then Tom Rogic somewhat accidentally wandered on the run of the match, weaving his way towards the Honduran penalty area with mounting intent. After he was upended and Jedinak’s free-kick deflected beyond Donis Escober the collective celebration captured the mood of a nation.
When Jedinak made the net bulge with his second and third set-pieces the mood verged towards euphoric. Not the delirious John Aloisi-running-down-the-touchline-waving-his-shirt-around-his-head kind, but a reminder all the same why the 33 and-a-half hours of football to get to that final final whistle were worthwhile.
The memories of Uruguay, Iran, Scotland and more, are never far from the memories of Australian football fans. Like the banners in the stands paying tribute to Johnny Warren and Les Murray, reminders why nights like Wednesday can never be taken for granted.
While this is job done for Australia, it remains to be seen if Postecoglou still has work to do. The coach was emotional but non-committal when asked about his future after becoming only the second Australian to guide his country to a World Cup finals.
“It’s pretty overwhelming to be honest,” he said. “When you’re coaching your own nation the burden of responsibility is even greater. We deserve to be there. These players deserve to be there. They’ve done it the hard way but they got their rewards.”
If this was his last game, Postecoglou will bow out after 49 matches on a deserved high. He won the Asian Cup. He navigated the most arduous World Cup qualifying campaign ever devised.
Watching players and staff celebrate in the centre of the pitch, showered in green and gold ticker tape, it seemed unthinkable the mastermind of the occasion may not get to experience the fruits of his labour in Russia.
It’s such a puzzling situation. These are Postecoglou’s players. This is his team. It’s a group only part way through its progression, embarking on only the fifth World Cup in Australia’s history.
Moreover, in the process Postecoglou’s ambition and bravery have taken on the gargantuan task of conceptually reframing perspective of the national team. Not only are the ghosts of playoffs past being extinguished but they’re being supplanted by bullish, optimistic rhetoric, the kind other Australian sports thrive on. If Postecoglou does take Australia to Russia, he is taking them to win.
“I think it’s important to stand for something, I’ve said it all along,” the coach said, with his players enjoying a lap of honour behind him. “I showed them the interview I did when I got the job and I said that day that we’re not going to take any backward steps over the next four years and we’re going to be bold and we’re going to be ambitious. That doesn’t come without challenges. That doesn’t come without obstacles and stumbles but stick to what we believe in.”
As Postecoglou embraced his jubilant players, tears welling in his eyes, it was impossible not to think there was unfinished business.
“It’s quite overwhelming,” he said. “This last four years is the hardest thing I have ever done. Where our starting point was, going to a World Cup with a rookie squad, knowing we had to win the Asian Cup then taking a group of players on a journey they had never been on before. It’s the hardest thing I’ve ever done.”
There is one even harder job still to tackle, if he wants to take it on.


Sir Bradley Wiggins has claimed his life was made “a living hell” because of a “malicious witch-hunt” into the contents of a bag delivered to him at the 2011 Critérium du Dauphiné. Wiggins, the 2012 Tour de France winner and five-times Olympic champion, made his comments after UK Anti-Doping closed its 14-month investigation into the package after being unable to find sufficient evidence it contained a banned substance.
But Damian Collins MP, the chairman of the digital, culture, media and sport select committee, warned Wiggins the decision was “not an exoneration of anyone”.
Referring to a Ukad statement saying its investigation had been hampered by a lack of detailed medical records, he said: “If Sky and British Cycling had kept proper medical records, this could have been wrapped up a lot sooner. It is unacceptable. A cloud now hangs over one of our greatest Olympians.”
Collins also said he would be publishing a select committee report into doping in sport “before Christmas”.
Wiggins denied he had committed any wrongdoing – and turned his fire on Ukad for not declaring him completely innocent after closing its case.
“Being accused of any doping indiscretion is the worst possible thing for any professional sportsperson, especially when it is without any solid factual basis and you know the allegation to be categorically untrue,” Wiggins said.
“I have kept my silence throughout this period to allow Ukad to conduct its investigation in the most professional way possible so as not to undermine it. This period of time has been a living hell for me and my family, full of innuendo and speculation. At times it felt nothing less than a malicious witch-hunt.”
Ukad began its case last year following a tip-off that the bag delivered to Wiggins contained the banned corticosteroid triamcinolone, which allows riders to lose weight while maintaining power. However, when giving evidence to parliament last December, Sir Dave Brailsford, who ran British Cycling and Team Sky in 2011, insisted it was the legal decongestant Fluimucil.
Ukad’s efforts to get to the truth were hindered by Dr Richard Freeman, the British Cycling doctor who administered the drug, being unable to give evidence to the inquiry, citing ill health.
Freeman had failed to upload medical records to his computer as required and later reported his laptop had been stolen while on holiday in Greece. The Guardian revealed this month he had resigned from British Cycling.
When giving evidence to parliament in March the head of Ukad, Nicole Sapstead, had said there were no records of British Cycling purchasing Fluimucil, which can be bought at chemists in France without a prescription, in the UK.
In contrast, she told the MPs, the organisation had purchased significant amounts of triamcinolone, a corticosteroid only allowed under anti-doping rules by specific medical exemption, which Wiggins is known to have used in other cases.
Wiggins has always maintained he did not know what was in the package, which was delivered to Freeman by the British Cycling women’s manager, Simon Cope.
When giving evidence to parliament in March, Cope explained that Shane Sutton – then the technical director for British Cycling – had asked him to take a package from British Cycling’s office in Manchester on a flight to Geneva, after which he was to drive to the finish of the Dauphiné in France. He denied knowing what was in the package.
In the statement, Sapstead said Ukad’s investigation had been “thorough and extensive”. She added: “Our investigation was hampered by a lack of accurate medical records being available at British Cycling.
“This is a serious concern. In this case the matter was further complicated by the crossover between personnel at British Cycling and Team Sky. We have referred some information to the GMC, and will cooperate with the GMC as necessary in respect of that information.”
In its own statement Team Sky said it was pleased at Ukad’s announcement. “We have always maintained there was no wrongdoing and we have cooperated fully with UK Anti-Doping over the last year,” it said. “We have continually strengthened our systems and processes so they best support our strong commitment to anti-doping.”
British Cycling was more contrite – with its chief executive, Julie Harrington, admitting the organisation had failed to meet the highest standards because of the lack of medical record keeping.
“Ukad’s findings represent an organisation and culture that, despite delivering on the world stage, did not meet the high standards British Cycling today holds itself to,” she said. “We note Ukad have referred information arising from their investigation to the General Medical Council and we offer them our wholehearted cooperation.
“We accept the relationship between British Cycling and Team Sky developed rapidly and as a result, at times, resulted in the blurring of the boundaries between the two. This led to some failings in the way that processes and people were managed.”
Other parts of the investigation remain open. As yet Ukad has been unable to establish why products containing testosterone were delivered to the national cycling centre.


The question Christian Pulisic tried to answer in his Players’ Tribune article this week is the million dollar one: how do you grow more Pulisics? This is not a new question. We’ve asked ourselves the same question about the Perezes, Hamms, Ramoses, Akerses, Reynas and Donovans. We’ve been producing great players in the US for decades – including Pulisic and several other promising young players we watched debut against Portugal on Tuesday night. But we haven’t been doing it at the rate that can make us a consistent world power on the men’s side.
I commend Christian for speaking his mind and agree with many of the things he said. I’ve been a fan of his since I first saw him with the youth national teams and now feel fortunate I will be able to watch him grow into the incredible player he’s destined to be.
Christian makes a compelling case for the importance of pushing one’s competitive limits between ages 16-18, and I agree that’s important. But of all the arguments on how and where to grow great American players – academies, residency, domestically, abroad – the one constant for every talented player I’ve come across is the many hours logged in unstructured settings. Either alone in a basement or on a field without a coach in sight. Every year the Ballon d’Or list is filled with players who cultivated their skill and fueled their competitive spirit in this way.
As Malcolm Gladwell explains in Outliers, a lot of what makes a player great is just the luck of where and when you were born. Being born in the US doesn’t preclude you from becoming a great soccer player; it just makes it more challenging. But the other takeaway from his book is that mastery of a craft comes from logging 10,000 hours honing it. That’s what young athletes playing pickup in other countries get – and what we’re lacking.
Part of the reason we don’t have this pickup culture is that the US is not yet a “soccer country”. I agree with Christian that we are becoming one, and that prospect fills me with so much joy – especially as someone who found and fell in love with this game against the odds. I didn’t grow up in a soccer house. We watched Notre Dame football; my dad wanted me to grow up and become Rocket Ismail. Now kids like Christian and Gio Reyna (another phenomenal young talent) grow up in soccer homes raised by soccer parents. But we still have a long way to go, and miscues like missing next year’s World Cup leave us standing still when we should be gaining on other sports.
We also have major strides to make in the way our youth development is organized. That’s not to say that there aren’t a lot of promising things happening, and lots of dedicated, talented coaches and club managers who, with little support, put in hours of often thankless work to help develop young talent. But the entire system lacks the cohesive vision and investment needed to ensure everyone is rowing in the same direction – and to make sure that no talent is priced out of the game.
We have the ability and the resources to make a soccer education in the US commensurate with one abroad, and we must. Going abroad to play in Europe is a great path for some players, but it’s not a path we should bank our future on. We need to figure out how to provide that environment here, and it begins, as Christian highlighted, with continuing to grow our soccer culture. That, and, as we did last in Portugal, with pushing our young talent on to a big stage and trusting them when it counts.
Sir Matt Busby said it best: “If you’re good enough, you’re old enough.” It’s time to step up.


Republic O’Ireland manager Martin O’Neill is never slow when it comes to blowing his own trumpet, but was left playing a sad trombone on Tuesday night. The man who famously reminded Fabio Cannavaro and Patrick Vieira he’d won two Big Cups before asking “how many have you two won?” during a stint of World Cup punditry was left harking back to former glories once again after watching his team get ripped asunder by a combination of his and their own ineptitude, plus a free-scoring Christian Eriksen at the Aviva Stadium.
Quizzed by RTÉ’s man Tony O’Donoghue about the tomfoolery that involved the removal of both his central midfielders at half-time, in the process granting Eriksen the freedom of the pitch, it was put to O’Neill that O’Ireland’s efforts descended into “something of a shambles”. Was it in fact “a humiliation”, the visibly chippy manager was asked, by an interrogator whose performance was arguably the most committed of any O’Irishman in the stadium.
Unimpressed with the shoeing he was getting when he was already down and out, O’Neill was prepared to grudgingly concede that “we were well beaten”, before reminding O’Donoghue that O’Ireland actually beat Germany not so long ago … albeit by fluke in a totally different competition. He then gave him his filthiest of stink-eyes before scampering off with the air about him of a man who’s just remembered those World Cup 2018 punditry gigs are likely to be snapped up fast and he should really get his Mr 15% on the case.
Quite what the long-term future holds for O’Neill or O’Ireland remains to be seen. Tuesday’s slaughter could spell the international end for several senior players, while many of the self-styled best fans in the world demonstrated their loyalty by rushing to the exits with more than 15 minutes to go. At a World Cup in a country where where fan violence is actively encouraged by some government officials, the heartwarming comedy relief provided by Theme Pub O’Fiver and his wacky compatriots is bound to be sorely missed. Whether it’s creepily scaring elderly nuns on trains or young women in the street, the Green Army pride themselves on the kind of joie de vivre that was in decidedly short supply when Nicklas Bendtner completed their humiliation.
But with the Irish bandwagon ground to a halt the Danish one has just got rolling. “Just to say, ‘Thank you very much for giving us space,’ because [O’Ireland] locked us down in Parken very well and Eriksen was very much out of the game and today he was fantastic,” said Danish manager Age Hareide. They were cruel parting words for poor beaten Paddy to take, but at least he’ll always have Martin O’Neill’s Big Cups as consolation.

As LiAngelo Ball, Jalen Hill and Cody Riley arrived at Los Angeles International Airport on Tuesday they were swamped by reporters. The three UCLA basketball players had been detained in China after being accused of stealing designer sunglasses from a high-end mall, and had been released after Donald Trump intervened and talked to his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping.
Reporters in LA wanted to know if the players had the sunglasses and whether they had let their college down. But the president had his own question. “Do you think the three UCLA Basketball Players will say thank you President Trump? They were headed for 10 years in jail!” tweeted Trump on Wednesday morning.
Do you think the three UCLA Basketball Players will say thank you President Trump? They were headed for 10 years in jail!
UCLA had been in Shanghai for the Pac-12 China Game, a season-opening win over Georgia Tech. LiAngelo Ball is the brother of Lonzo Ball, the Los Angeles Lakers rookie. On Tuesday, Trump said he had intervened on the players’ behalf during his own visit to Asia. “What they did was unfortunate. You know, you’re talking about very long prison sentences,” Trump said. “[The Chinese authorities] do not play games.” Before adding Xi had been “terrific” in attempting to resolve the situation.
Trump has been vocal about sports recently. In September he said that any NFL player who protested during the national anthem is a “son of a bitch”.


Martin O’Neill said he would take a couple of weeks to mull over the implications of the Republic of Ireland’s play-off defeat before deciding whether to follow through on the informal agreement he reached a month ago to remain in charge for another two years.
He would be entitled to reach the conclusion that one ghastly loss does not negate the positives that preceded it; results have generally been better than expected during his four years in charge. The question is would that continue to be the case? The answer is probably not but he has somehow defied probability for much of his career. Not on Tuesday night, though.
When you believe that it does not matter how you win so long as you win, then you had better not lose. Because when you do, the manner of that defeat matters all the more. And the manner of the defeat to Denmark – 5-1 on the night and on aggregate – could hardly have been worse for O’Neill.
The flaws that had been evident even in many of the draws and victories were again plain to see – such as the rashness and the slovenly passing by players who, though limited, are not naturally incompetent – but there was also a sorry dwindling of the qualities that had previously enabled Ireland somehow to offset the flaws. If plan A was to keep things tight and fight, plan B seemed to be for that to go out the window.
Panicky and disjointed, this was a mindless disintegration. So much so that even several of the players vaunted for their sense of solidarity could be seen berating each other as the Danes danced merrily between them. Ireland bottled it in Dublin. So total was the breakdown this seemed more than the end of a campaign, it looked like the conclusion to an era, too, and not just for a clutch of players in their mid-30s.
O’Neill helped to deliver the coup de grace himself with a couple of half‑time substitutions that undermined the approach he had hitherto sworn by. It would be interesting to know whether any of the Ireland players were tempted to mount a Daniele De Rossi-style protest when the manager announced Ireland would try to find a way back into the game by vacating central midfield. Gifting space to Christian Eriksen was akin to leaving your car door open and the keys in the ignition when you hear a robber is on the prowl. Risks had to be taken but this one seemed woefully miscalculated – especially as the player introduced in the hope of giving Ireland supremacy out wide was Aiden McGeady.
This was his 93rd cap. Only six players in history have won more for the Republic of Ireland. No one has disappointed anywhere near as often.
When O’Neill spoke last month about the likelihood of extending his contract, he said the prospect of integrating an exciting crop of young players was one of the factors that appealed most to him. In the first leg, in Copenhagen, he suggested he really meant that when he gave the ultimate show of faith to Callum O’Dowda, starting the 22-year-old, who had impressed on his first competitive start against Moldova last month. But when push came to shove on Tuesday, the manager did not turn to O’Dowda but to McGeady, the tried and unduly trusted.
Several players, in fairness, grew into fine international players under O’Neill during the Euro 2016 campaign, most obviously Darren Randolph, Robbie Brady, Jeff Hendrick and Shane Long. Only Randolph maintained that standard during the attempt to reach the World Cup. Brady, Hendrick and Long have regressed.
So it seemed ominous when several of the players who have improved during the latest campaign made ruinous mistakes, including Duffy and Stephen Ward. It made one wonder further about the sustainability of O’Neill’s method. That method appears to owe much to his charisma, which is enhanced by his achievements as a player and as a manager. Tuesday night left a smudge on that record. His credibility is diminished, at least temporarily. Time for some fresh ideas, if not from O’Neill then from someone else.
Actually, it is time for a hardening of ideas. So long as the team act as a mask to conceal the lack of a proper talent development plan in the country from the Football Association of Ireland or a well-supported domestic league, then any Ireland manager is going to be confronted with a batch of players unlikely to gatecrash major tournaments regularly. The team are a public relations vehicle with a slapdash paint job and a dicky engine. That is where the real muddle lies.
O’Neill is in the line of fire now because he made too many compromises. He was not pragmatic enough. He should, for instance, have taken a leaf out of Jack Charlton’s book and made sure the grass was left to grow long at the Aviva Stadium before the visit of Denmark, who struggled in the first leg with the unevenness of their own pitch in Copenhagen. Do not give Ireland the team they want. Give them the team they deserve.


It is worth keeping in mind on these occasions that rugby union usually strikes gold with its World Cup hosting decisions. Australia proved a runaway success in 2003 despite New Zealand’s de-selection as co-host, France staged a grand tournament four years later, an entire nation of rugby-mad Kiwis rose to the logistical challenge in 2011 and the record sums generated by England 2015 were matched only by the intense interest levels.
Japan will be next up in two years’ time, offering Asia a deserved slice of the action. And now, in 2023, it will be France once again. Plus ça change. The verdict will not go down well in South Africa or Ireland – and that is a major understatement. No one doubts France will put on a good show but at what cost to rugby’s reputation for transparency and integrity? The lure of more dosh, not for the first time, appears to have trumped all else.
It is a deeply uncomfortable outcome, too, for World Rugby’s high command, whose formal recommendation of South Africa has failed to be ratified by its own council. Over the past 48 hours in particular some of the lobbying behind the scenes has put even the Eurovision Song Contest’s partial voting patterns in the shade. The RFU, in particular, was torn between its two European allies, ultimately opting to vote for Ireland in round one and France thereafter. Clever. In the final analysis – with Ireland attracting only eight of the 39 available votes initially – the two-horse race ended with France romping away by 24 to South Africa’s 15.
Somebody had to lose – and all three bids had their merits – but what on earth was the point of the whole in-depth independent technical assessment if voters were ultimately too blinded by self interest to worry about the nitty-gritty? And where does that leave South African sporting morale, with both the 2022 Commonwealth Games and a Rugby World Cup now having been offered only to be snatched away? As Bill Beaumont, World Rugby’s chairman, put it: “It’s like a game of rugby. You have to dust yourself down, shake hands and get on with it.”
As previously stated in these pages, the emotional favourite would have been Ireland. It is hardly sour grapes to suggest it would have thrown a RWC party so riotously entertaining it would have blown the doors off almost every other sporting event ever held. Even the most teetotal of supporters ordering a lemonade in a remote County Kerry pub would have been instantly welcomed into the bosom of the rugby family. Will Ireland ever see a World Cup now?
Instead, hard-headed commercial logic has prevailed, even though Paris will host the Olympics in 2024. As is being experienced with Japan 2019, the knock-on effect for rugby in terms of advertising and sponsorship is not insignificant. There was also an element of playing safe politically. The main question mark over the South Africa bid had nothing to do with its splendid rugby grounds or the playing strength or otherwise of the host nation, but the wider outlook between now and 2023. Maybe it would all have been fine and dandy but, unlike in 1995, there is no unifying Nelson Mandela figure binding the Rainbow Nation together.

France will certainly be presented as the sensible fiscal choice, even if it appears to have been more of a triumph for Bernard Laporte’s powers of persuasion than anything else. More money for all, but at what price? The last thing World Rugby wanted was to be bracketed with Qatar, awarded the 2022 football World Cup despite numerous logistical concerns. No one is suggesting any Gallic impropriety but rugby does seem increasingly keen to follow, so to speak, in football’s slipstream.
Not everyone reckons this is wise. This week, with RWC voting machinations raging around him, the World Rugby vice-chairman, Gus Pichot, stood at a lectern in London and asked the assembled delegates: “What are we here for?” He spoke, movingly, of his love for the game and the inclusive family values of rugby. “Money, agents and TV rights don’t produce that, we produce that in our countries,” he said. “Don’t get it wrong. That’s what we are. It’s up to you guys to keep it that way. If we keep these values the game will grow and get bigger and bigger. More importantly, we’ll have great people and a better world.”
The altruistic Pichot, it is fair to say, would not rise swiftly up Fifa’s unpleasantly greasy pole. But was anyone listening? Arguably far more important than the 2023 World Cup destination, as Pichot intimated, is finding a path for the sport’s have-nots at an increasingly delicate stage in the professional game’s development.
Promote the interests of Samoa, Fiji, Tonga, Georgia and the United States now and the reward will be more competitive World Cups for decades to come. Revert to the closed-shop mentality of yore and it will not greatly matter where the 2027 or 2031 World Cups are staged because the golden goose will be increasingly emaciated.
And that, ultimately, matters more than purely obsessing over how lucrative a 2023 World Cup might yet be. The strengthening of the Pacific Islands, looking at new ways to minimise the risk of concussion, preserving the health of Test rugby itself: none of it should be breezily overlooked.
Bravo, France, but rugby cannot allow naked self-interest to run rampant.


Papa John’s has apologized for comments made by CEO John Schnatter blaming sluggish pizza sales on NFL players kneeling during the national anthem.
The company is a major NFL sponsor and advertiser, and Schnatter said on an earnings this month that “NFL leadership has hurt Papa John’s shareholders” and that the protests “should have been nipped in the bud a year and a half ago.”
But on Tuesday night, the company tweeted a statement on offering to “work with the players and league to find a positive way forward.”
“The statements made on our earnings call were describing the factors that impact our business and we sincerely apologize to anyone that thought they were divisive,” it said. “That definitely was not our intention.
“We believe in the right to protest inequality and support the players’ movement to create a new platform for change. We also believe, as Americans, we should honor our anthem. There is a way to do both.”
We will work with the players and league to find a positive way forward. Open to ideas from all. Except neo-nazis — 🖕those guys. (3/3)
The movement was started last year by former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who kneeled to protest what he said was police mistreatment of blacks. More players began kneeling after President Donald Trump said at an Alabama rally last month that team owners should get rid of players who protest during the anthem. Schnatter donated to Donald Trump’s presidential campaign.
Papa John’s added that it is “open to ideas from all. Except neo-nazis.” It has previously tried to distance itself from white supremacists who praised Schnatter’s comments, saying it does not want those groups to buy its pizza.
The company’s stock has fallen by nearly 13% since Schnatter’s comments.


It is difficult to draw too many conclusions from France’s two friendlies in the last few days given they were missing half of their team. Paul Pogba, N’Golo Kanté, Benjamin Mendy, Hugo Lloris are all but automatic first choices when fit, while Thomas Lemar, Ousmane Dembélé and Djibril Sidibé are also among the first names on Didier Deschamps’ team sheet. The manager will not have reached any earth-shattering revelations against a Wales side who were demoralised after their failure to qualify for the World Cup and a Germany side who were also missing key players (Manuel Neuer, Jérôme Boateng, Thomas Müller), but he was given a few surprises – and reasons to feel positive.
France played well enough as they beat a listless Wales team 2-0 and drew 2-2 in Cologne but they remain just below the three pre-tournament favourites: Brazil, Spain and Germany. The most striking thing about France’s two friendlies was the way Antoine Griezmann impressed against Wales. He has struggled badly with Atlético Madrid this season as they have drifted in La Liga and struggled in the Champions League. However, he sparkled on Friday night, finding the back of the net early on and working hard as a genuine creative presence.
Griezmann, playing off Olivier Giroud and using the Arsenal striker’s physicality to find space, was in a slightly different role to the one he adopted at Euro 2016. On Friday he dropped deeper and pulled wide, allowing Kylian Mbappé to cut inside as he played like a No10 in a 4-2-3-1. With Mbappé now learning how to play on the right at Paris Saint-Germain (after having played largely from the left at Monaco), Griezmann is finding more freedom and space.
Whether playing a 4-2-3-1 (as they did against Wales), a 4-3-3 (as they did against Germany) or a 4-4-2 (as they did in Euro 2016), France have often struggled to find the right balance on the right wing. Deschamps has varied his personnel from game to game, depending on form and injuries. Moussa Sissoko has played there with boundless energy but little attacking quality; Kingsley Coman is an archetypal if limited winger who has stuttered in recent months; Florian Thauvin only appears to be given a place to appease Marseille fans; and Ousmane Dembélé has not played since September and may not return until the end of the year.
Mbappé has been slightly off the pace since moving to Paris but he was probably France’s best player in this round of fixtures, at least among the group who started both matches. If he plays wide, he drags defenders with him and creates space for his team-mates. But he also creates confusion when he moves infield, as he did for Griezmann’s goal on Friday night. France were effectively playing with three narrow strikers but Wales struggled to cope, even with a back three.
Giroud scored the second goal on Friday night as he made his case to be involved next summer, despite rarely starting for Arsenal and facing a renewed challenge from Karim Benzema, who is ramping up the pressure for a return with an aggressive media campaign. Again, Mbappé was involved. He burst down the right wing before neatly slipping the ball to Giroud, who doubled France’s lead. Deschamps will face a dilemma when Dembélé returns to full fitness but for now he can be happy with his forward line, not least because Griezmann and Mbappé will have gained confidence from how they performed in slightly new roles.
The two weren’t the only forwards who enjoyed these fixtures, though. Alexandre Lacazette scored a brace against Germany. The Arsenal striker is unlikely to start next summer but his finishing is as ruthless as ever and he seems assured a place in the squad, an unlikely turnaround given that Deschamps seemed to prefer the likes of Kévin Gameiro a year ago. Lacazette will need to continue scoring for Arsenal but, for the time being, his form is another pleasant surprise for France.
Lacazette’s former Lyon team-mates, Anthony Martial and Corentin Tolisso, also distinguished themselves in these two matches and have become genuine contenders for starting roles. Thomas Lemar’s creativity and prowess on the ball probably give him the edge over Martial but the Manchester United player, having been left out of the last squad, delivered a firm rebuttal in setting up Lacazette’s first goal against Germany. More impressive, however, is his improved decision-making with the ball at his feet.
When playing in Ligue 1, Martial relied on his pace. He found scoring all too easy at Monaco when playing alongside the creative nexus of João Moutinho, Yannick Ferreira Carrasco and Bernardo Silva. His first touch, however, was often lacking, a flaw that pace and acceleration cannot mask in the quicker Premier League. Two years on from his big-money move to Manchester, Martial now looks like a player worth his fee. His work ethic and overall intelligence are making him a more complete and creative player, while his pace remains a potent weapon.
Tolisso, though, may have given Deschamps the most food for thought of any player in the squad. He showcased his versatility on Friday against Wales, setting up Griezmann’s goal with a sparkling assist, affecting play with his passing, running with the ball at his feet and showing that he can play the box-to-box role usually taken by Paul Pogba. Against Germany he played on the right of a midfield three and looked equally at ease, comfortably going toe-to-toe with Julian Draxler and Toni Kroos. Kanté and Pogba will expect to be first choice in a midfield two but, if Deschamps choses to play a three, Tolisso looks ideal – especially given how weary Blaise Matuidi looked against Germany.
Benjamin Pavard and Steven N’Zonzi, who both made their international debuts over the weekend, also impressed. They looked well suited to international football. N’Zonzi’s maturity and composure was no surprise, but 21-year-old Pavard was equally assured. Sold by Lille to Stuttgart last summer, the lanky youngster has steadily improved in the Bundesliga. He is far from being an attack-minded full-back, but if he continues to progress, his defensive ability could come in handy against certain opponents, especially in light of Sidibé’s not infrequent lapses in concentration.
Both of the debutants have work to do if they are to make it to Russia but they, like many of their compatriots, seem eager to seize their chance, even if it comes as a result of injuries to others. These impressive individual performances leave Deschamps with increasingly tough choices to make. Given how doggedly he clung to players such as Dimitri Payet and Patrice Evra in recent years, these changes represent a near-seismic shift in his approach, and France, now seemingly spoiled for choice, seem an increasingly dangerous proposition.

Sergio Agüero is expected to return to training with Manchester City as scheduled despite the “dizzy spell” he endured at half-time during Argentina’s friendly defeat against Nigeria in Krasnodar on Tuesday night.
The forward was due to fly home on Wednesday following the 4-2 defeat and take part in his scheduled session with Pep Guardiola’s squad. Agüero was taken to hospital in the Russian city as a precaution, with the club later stating that Agüero had encountered a “dizzy spell”.
City have been training all week with those players away on international duty returning to the sessions when they arrive back. There is no requirement for Agüero to have his return to training interrupted and the 29-year-old is expected to be available for selection for the Premier League game at Leicester City on Saturday.
Agüero is City’s joint top-scorer this season with 10 goals in 12 appearances.


No goals scored and only three shots on target – it is fair to say England’s displays in their two end-of-year, prestige friendlies against Germany and Brazil were less than sparkling. However, the occasions did allow Gareth Southgate to fully test his increasingly favoured 3-5-2 formation and allow a host of players, some new, some old, to stake their claim for a place in his squad for next summer’s World Cup. The Guardian looks at how the 10 with the most to play for fared.
One of six debutants across the matches, the 23-year-old played the entirety of the draw with Germany and impressed throughout, producing a string of excellent saves, most notably from Timo Werner, and catching the eye with his consistently excellent distribution. The Everton goalkeeper’s place in the squad is secure and he has emerged as a serious threat to Joe Hart for the No1 spot.
Should he go to Russia? Definitely
Among the few players to complete both games and did not disgrace himself in either. The 24-year-old Leicester City man was deployed on the left of England’s three-man defence and showed decent positioning and robustness. Maguire’s distribution, one of the reasons he was selected ahead of Chris Smalling, could have been better but it was hardly appalling.
Should he go to Russia? Definitely
Named man of the match against Brazil on the back of an assured display as the right-sided man of a back three. The 20-year-old, who also played the majority of the game against Germany after Phil Jones’s injury, has consistently done well for Liverpool this season and his versatility, alongside his athletic and technical talents, makes him a useful asset at senior level.
Should he go to Russia? Definitely
Arguably the most intriguing selection given he started both games as part of a two-man frontline. Overall the 30-year-old Leicester forward did well, showing a willingness to attack space, close down defenders and link up with first Tammy Abraham and then Marcus Rashford. With Harry Kane a certainty to start once fit, Vardy did his chances of being the Tottenham Hotspur striker’s long-term partner no harm.
Should he go to Russia? Definitely
Featured for 10 minutes against Brazil on what was his first showing on the international scene for four years. The 32-year-old produced an excellent block to stop Willian’s shot and delivered a decent delivery which Dominic Solanke arguably should have converted. Young’s experience and flexibility make the Manchester United man well worth consideration for a place in Southgate’s squad for next year’s finals.
Should he go to Russia? Possibly
Named man of the match against Germany, which led to some overboard assessments of the 21-year-old’s display. Yes, there were some impressive touches but, as Eric Dier said, it would be wrong to get carried away. It was a shame for Loftus-Cheek that he was forced off against Brazil with an early injury but all he can do is head back to Crystal Palace and continue to catch Southgate’s eye.
Should he go to Russia? Possibly
He will always have those four minutes against Germany. Hard to judge someone who played for such a small amount of time but equally that may well be telling – the 28-year-old Burnley midfielder is talented and deserved his call-up after a long and varied career but it is hard to see him featuring again, especially after players such as Adam Lallana and Dele Alli are back from injury.
Should he go to Russia? No
Played almost the entirety of both games but the West Bromwich Albion midfielder made little impact and against Brazil in particular displayed poor ball retention and distribution skills. May get another call-up but appears not up to the standard required at the highest level.
Should he go to Russia? No
How different things could have been for the 20-year-old had he connected with Vardy’s cross and scored after two minutes of his debut against Germany. But he failed to do so and became an increasingly frustrated figure up until his substitution on 60 minutes. A brief cameo against Brazil was not illuminating either and it feels as if the opportunity at senior level came too soon for the striker on loan at Swansea from Chelsea.
Should he go to Russia? No
The 20-year-old’s call-up for the Brazil game was further testament to Southgate’s belief in giving youth a chance and there were some nice moments from the striker after he came on for Vardy on 75 minutes. But given he has played only 85 minutes of Premier League football since joining Liverpool in the summer, it is perhaps best Solanke’s development is not rushed.
Should he go to Russia? No


The Socceroos are going to next year’s World Cup, but the identity of the coach who will lead them there remains the subject of conjecture. With the Australians’ passage to Russia confirmed with a win over Honduras in the second leg of their intercontinental World Cup qualifier, Ange Postecoglou stuck to the well-trodden path of refusing to confirm whether he would continue on as manager, or end his tenure.
At the end of October, he had told reporters he would “have a discussion” about his plans once the team sealed their qualification, after reports emerged he had decided to quit before the tournament in June next year.
With qualification settled on Wednesday night in Sydney, Postecoglou refused to commit one way or the other but the 52-year old did promise the decision “won’t take too long”.
“Right now its just about enjoying the moment,” he said. “I owe it to myself, particularly my family, my wife, my boys and my friends. What happens beyond here can be picked up tomorrow and we can decide then. I won’t take too long. I’ll sit down with the powers that be. But obviously I’m going to make sure I enjoy this first.”
When asked if it would be difficult to leave the team, who he has coached for nearly five years, he simply responded: “I guess so”.
It was a muted, reflective press conference, with Postecoglou rolling back the years to talk about his initial appointment, his first matches and the philosophy – of attacking, possession-based football – that he has tried to bring to the national team.
The match began, he said, with him showing the players his debut press conference from 2013. It ended with his future still uncertain. “[In 2013] I said we’re not going to take any backward steps, we’re going to be bold, we’re going to be ambitious,” he said. “With that comes some stumbles and some scrutiny.”
He hit back at reports that he was angry at the media or wearied by their criticism.
“People presume that I’ve been under siege or I feel under siege,” he said. “But for the most part I’ve had a lot of encouragement from the general public and a lot of people in the game, they just don’t happen to hold a microphone.
“This has been the greatest honour of my life ... If people still think that I go around worrying about what other people say, trying to get some vindication, they’ve missed the last 20 years.”
Regardless of their coach’s uncertainty, Postecoglou said the squad’s preparation for the 2018 World Cup was well on track.
“A lot of the planning for the World Cup is in place. We’ve already got a training base, we’ve got a city we’re going to stay in. All that stuff was done 12 months ago. There isn’t another game until March. From that perspective there’s nothing of real urgency.
“It’s been a remarkable four years. Tonight when I saw them going for the second goal, saw them going for the third goal, its exactly the way I want my teams to play. And moving forward, it’s hopefully what will make people sit up and take notice.”
Speaking in October, Football Federation Australia chief executive David Gallop said the speculation had not been “ideal” in the lead-up to the crucial playoff qualifier. But after that, he said, “we need to make a decision”.


France is toasting the announcement that it will host the 2023 Rugby World Cup after being named the surprise winner of a secret World Rugby council ballot in London on Wednesday.
The bid beat off competition from the preferred hosts, South Africa – who play France in Paris on Saturday – and Ireland, having received the nomination after a second round of voting was required.
Final: Eden Park, Auckland Winners: New Zealand 
Final: Twickenham, London Winners: Australia
Final: Ellis Park, Johannesburg Winners: South Africa 
Final: Millennium Stadium, Cardiff Winners: Australia
Final: Stadium Australia, Sydney Winners: England
Final: Stade de France, Paris Winners: South Africa 
Final: Eden Park, Auckland Winners: New Zealand
Final: Twickenham, London Winners: New Zealand 
Final: International Stadium, Yokohama

The World Rugby chairman, Bill Beaumont, was forced to defend the governing body after the decision went against an independent evaluation report at the end of last month which recommended South Africa be nominated as hosts.
“A humiliation for me? I don’t think so. I don’t think that at all,” Beaumont told a media conference. “There’s always got to be one recommendation in the evaluation process and that was South Africa.
“If you look, there wasn’t a great deal between France and South Africa in the evaluation report. It was very close. We feel the process has been absolutely transparent. Everyone’s been able to see how the scoring was.”
It was the first time that World Rugby had commissioned and made public such a report and there was no precedent as to whether council members would rubber-stamp South Africa as the 2023 host, or vote according to other criteria. The members were not bound by the outcome of the technical report but it will be of great embarrassment to World Rugby that France has prevailed considering this process was adopted in the interests of transparency.
None of the three teams were allowed to change the details or their bid or offer inducements to council members but there were reports of the very horse-trading and lobbying that the process was designed to prevent in the run-up to the vote.
In the first round of voting, France were given 18 votes, two short of the 20 majority required, with South Africa receiving 13 and Ireland 8. In round two, France reached 24 votes to secure victory, with South Africa on 15.
South African insiders had feared the worst on the eve of the vote having declined to lobby for support. In the wake of the announcement, John Smit, who lifted the World Cup for the Springboks in 2007, posted on Twitter: “That is devastating news, the joys of a secret ballot.”
South Africa Rugby expressed disappointment over the decision and said the process became “opaque” following the independent report.
SA Rugby chief executive, Jurie Roux, said: “World Rugby ran exhaustive, transparent process for 15 months to identify best host nation, only for the process to go entirely opaque for past two weeks. The view of the experts and World Rugby’s leadership was overturned by World Rugby council members.”
SA Rugby president, Mark Alexander, said: “We did everything in our power to bring the tournament to South Africa. We are bitterly disappointed at this decision and would like to apologise to the people and government of South Africa for raising their hopes. It is sad that this is the first time that the World Rugby council votes against the recommendation of their board and that raises questions for them.”
Ireland and France had gone on an offensive following the publication of World Rugby’s technical report on 31 October. The French federation’s president, Bernard Laporte, who described the report as “nonsense”, led a last-minute campaign to charm voters off the back of France’s financial strength.
The chief executive of the Ireland union, Phillip Browne, went as far as to write a letter to World Rugby outlining his grievances. It was targeted at council members and pointed out that as all three bids were judged to be excellent, ignoring the consultants’ recommendation was hardly a giant leap. So it proved, although Ireland, as in the technical report, finished third of three candidates. In the immediate aftermath of the result, Irish Rugby tweeted: “Congratulations #France2023. Bonne chance.”
Browne later thanked those who had supported their bid and stated: “For almost six years we have focused passionately on bringing a Rugby World Cup to Ireland in 2023. In that time we developed a world-class proposition which reflected positively on Ireland and saw us formally acknowledged as a destination well capable of hosting a superb Rugby World Cup.
It is not to be. Our race is now run. Today belongs to France. They have our warmest congratulations and very best wishes for a magnificent Rugby World Cup in 2023.”

There are some simple equations for predicting which teams will enjoy the most success in international rugby league. They go something like this. The team with the most NRL players wins. The team with the most NRL and Super League players wins. The team with the most full-time players wins. It is a fairly reliable gauge.
So, if you strip a large number of the NRL and Super League players from a nation’s team, they are done for. Witness France being torn to shreds by England in the opening quarter of their match on Sunday, all of the Wales results (a 50-6 defeat to Papua New Guinea, a 72-6 defeat to Fiji and a 34-6 defeat to Ireland) and Scotland’s first two performances (a 50-4 defeat to Tonga and a 74-6 defeat to New Zealand).
At full-strength, those three teams could compete with most nations outside the big three but instead we watched second string sides being pulverised. Wales had only three Super League players; most of Scotland’s full-timers played in the Championship this year; and France were missing nearly all of their best players. And, if you only have a couple of full-time players – Exhibit A: USA – then good luck.
I recall back in 2000 being annoyed by the Guardian’s rugby league guru Andy Wilson having a Kangaroo counter for each team in the paper’s World Cup preview pull-out (yes, really). Every team had some Australians; several squads were packed with them. It’s the same 17 years on, with every country having someone from the world’s rugby league factory (even France have former Newtown Jet, Mark Kheirallah, who qualifies on residency grounds after five years at Toulouse Olympique). The more Aussies you have, the better you are likely to be. Exhibit B: Lebanon, who face the terrifying Tongans in the quarter-finals this weekend.
Clearly that is not a long-term solution. European rugby league needs to find other sources of talent over the next four years to match the evolution in the Pacific; they can’t just fill their teams with Antipodeans, Yorkshiremen, Cumbrians and Lancastrians.
Many of the dozen products of Welsh RL were out of their depth and the best not even present, while of Ireland’s four homegrown players only Matty Hadden made a cameo appearance. Sole Scotland RL product Dave Scott didn’t make it on to the pitch. There is hope in Wales: almost all of their Under-16 team that beat England recently have signed with Super League clubs and some will come through by the next World Cup, in 2021. But the gene pool needs to widen and new territories need to be tapped.
We can look down south for cheer. The outstanding development work done by the Broncos and RFL staff over the last 15 years in London and the South has borne fruit. There are players from Lewisham, Richmond, Enfield, Sawbridgeworth, Basingstoke and High Wycombe representing the home nations in the World Cup. Remarkable.
But where else might this expansion come from? The northeast? Possibly. The southwest? Probably not. Maybe from a community within an existing heartland of the game. Don’t be surprised if Jamaica are at the next World Cup, at the expense of the USA or Canada. Their fans would certainly add vibrancy.
The Europeans need to find fresh sources of athleticism, power and explosive strength from somewhere. England’s rugby union leaders took deliberate steps to do this by cherrypicking whatever talent they could find from all over the world. Exhibit C: Nathan Hughes, who was born in Fiji, moved to Wasps in 2013 and has been playing for England’s rugby union team for the last year. Given the history of Tonga, Fiji, Samoa and Papua New Guinea, it is perhaps surprising that England RL have not found islanders eligible to wear the St George’s cross, like they have with several Australians.
If England follow the rest of Europe and tumble out of the tournament this weekend, at least very few fans at home will have watched live coverage of their match against the effervescent Papua New Guinea: kick-off is at 5am!
As predicted last week, Scotland bunkered down, pulled together and delivered a performance to be proud of against Samoa in Cairns. It was impossible not to assume that the vanquished Danny Brough would have kicked either the late penalty or one of their two field goal attempts to send Scotland to Darwin for a quarter-final meeting with Australia. Instead they came home with pride restored and a new-look squad with a senior core led by the extraordinary Danny Addy, Ben Hellewell, Dale Ferguson and Ben Kavanagh.
There was another positive to Scotland’s tour. As they travelled the continent, they met up with former internationals who had not received their caps when they first played for Scotland. Dual-coder Jim McLaren and Chris Orr, now a major players agent, were given theirs in Lake Ainsworth; former Bradford and Huddersfield centre Darrel Shelford received his in Christchurch; and I was delighted to present former London Broncos and Warrington full-back Andrew Duncan with his in his native Brisbane. We did it at Suncorp Stadium, by the original Origin wall of honour, which lists everyone who played for Queensland before State of Origin began. On there is his father Bob Duncan, proud Scot, who still considers the 1962 Lions the toughest opponents he ever faced!
The failure of all the European nations bar England to make the quarter-finals had consequences reaching as far as the RLEF office at London Bridge. With seven places at the 2021 World Cup reserved for Europe but only England qualifying automatically, next year’s European Championship will be the first opportunity for France, Scotland, Ireland, Wales and Italy to clinch a place at England 2021. Whatever the format – and England will be involved – whoever flops next year will have to compete in a play-off in 2019 against the likes of Serbia, Russia and Spain – or an Aussie-bolstered Malta and Greece – for the final couple of places.
The success of the Pacific nations – with all of six reaching the last eight – has inadvertently helped with the inaugural Nines World Cup. It’s being lined up for Australia in October 2019, a fortnight after the NRL Grand Final and the weekend after Super League’s version. The 12 invited nations can now feature all the Pacific nations – and their thousands of passionate fans – England, Lebanon, and the Europeans who qualify next year for 2021. Squad selection will be a challenge with it coming between the Super League play-offs and the Great Britain tour a week or so later.
Another intriguing issue surrounding the 2018 international calendar: Super League has kept 1-3 June free, when half the NRL clubs have a bye due to Origin, including Wayne Bennett’s Brisbane Broncos. But the NRL’s Rep Weekend is 22-24 June, when eight Super League clubs will be playing in the Challenge Cup quarter-finals. So either England are going to face the Kiwis in the mid-season Test (possibly in Denver, Colorado folks) with half a team, or the RFL will have to move the Challenge Cup dates, thus leaving a two-month gap between the last eight and the semis. Oh dear.
Strolling around Suncorp Stadium, I bumped into Mike Castle, the former London Skolars forward, who now works in the NRL’s development office there. Castle, originally from Oxford, has been down under for a decade now and will get a taste of the World Cup when he coaches Canada’s team – the Ravens – in the Women’s World Cup, which begins on Thursday.
The Ravens are all rugby union players who have switched codes for a few weeks and Castle has the job of moulding them into a side to compete with holders New Zealand, Papua New Guinea and Australia, all of whom they play in seven rather demanding days. Make the semi-final and it will be four games in ten days. And the men complain about player welfare?! England, who have the same schedule, face Papua New Guinea, Australia and the Cook Islands. Incidentally, there will be a four-team women’s comp at the Nines World Cup, too.
While the full houses in Papua New Guinea and New Zealand have been wonderful, the much criticised Australian attendances are actually about par for the World Cup games and worth putting into context. The USA and Italy are normally watched by a few hundred, not a few thousand; Scotland have only once been watched by more than the 12,130 who saw them crushed in Christchurch (when the same sides met in Leeds four years ago); Wales rarely attract more than the 7,732 who witnessed their annihilation by Fiji; and there has never been a crowd anywhere near as large to watch the annual Wales-Ireland fixture as there was in Perth on Sunday.
The disappointments have been in NRL cities: Townsville, Canberra, and Sydney (if it wasn’t for the fabulous Lebanese support). Here’s hoping Brisbane responds in its usual manner when elite league comes to town. The role the sport plays there was underlined when I went through security at Brisbane airport wearing my ‘And he does a bit of a boogie’ T-shirt, featuring Henderson Gill scoring for Great Britain in victory over the Australians in 1988 (there were only 15,000 at the Sydney Football Stadium that day, too). The middle-aged guard took one look and said: “Now, don’t tell me… Ellery Hanley? No? Erm, Martin Offiah? No? Aaaah…” When I put him out of his misery he says “Of course! I recognised the Trophy (sponsor) on the shirt!”

If the basis for judging Keith Pelley is the bottom line, the European Tour’s chief executive appears worthy of high praise.
A year ago, Graeme Storm retained his tour card when 111th in the rankings with seasonal earnings of €247,000. Marcel Siem has survived into 2018 while lying 101st in the order of merit; his 2017 winnings are €388,000. Tom Lewis, who finished 135th, headed to qualifying school with the hardly insignificant fallback of €227,000. Boosted by the introduction of Rolex Series events, with prize pots a minimum of $7m, there is a legitimate argument that Europe’s leading players – and even those in the second tier – have never had it so good. Access to the Rolex Series is available to a broad spectrum of players.
And yet, there are matters worthy of debate. Money available through Rolex Series events – there are eight on the European Tour’s schedule – renders them highly significant in European Ryder Cup qualifying context. So, too, does the rule that says no qualification points are available from tournaments played elsewhere in the same week as a Rolex Series competition. This affected Graeme McDowell, for example, as he shared 10th at the PGA Tour event on the same weekend as the Turkish Airlines Open.
In Turkey, the sponsors continued with a theme of handing appearance fees to select players, with Justin Rose, Henrik Stenson and Matt Kuchar understood to be among them, in a specific nod to those who won medals at the 2016 Olympics. Rose fully justified such faith by winning the tournament and the trio formed an integral part of publicity in the lead-up to the event. Kuchar did not travel to Turkey, though, after problems with the country’s relationship with the United States meant he could not obtain a visa.
The offering of appearance fees is not new in Turkey: Tiger Woods has benefited while Rory McIlroy would have done a year ago but for a late decision not to play in the tournament. It also happens elsewhere – at the HSBC Championship in Abu Dhabi, for example, where a relatively small prize pot is offset by seven-figure appearance sums handed to players such as Dustin Johnson and Rickie Fowler. It remains to be seen whether or not the disappointing departure of the hugely influential and respected Giles Morgan as HSBC’s head of sponsorship has an impact on affairs in the Middle East. The European Tour rightly stresses that tournament promoters, rather than the Tour itself, pay appearance riches.
Sergio García’s arrival at next week’s Hong Kong Open – the Masters champion has cited scheduling issues as a reason not to wildly chase a Race to Dubai title – is not without high cost to the tournament host. On the PGA Tour, appearance fees are virtually accepted as part of the week-on-week scene – in stark comparison to Europe. In the United States, incentive comes in various forms: paid for travel, accommodation or even meals with sponsors. Golfers are very quick to assert how money does not supply motivation, which should not be mistaken for those individuals not appreciating their own value.
There is little or nothing by way of complaint from other players. Everyone benefits, for example, from the participation of the world’s leading players and the knock-on boost to ranking points. Woods, albeit a different commercial animal to all others, collected appearance fees all over the world for years, with a tournament’s appeal enhanced by his presence or even just his picture on billboards. From players themselves, there would be the not unreasonable point that use of their status – and time – to promote a tournament should not be on voluntary terms.
Nonetheless, the situation raises questions. It seems fair to ask what standard of field would participate in Turkey were enticement not given to stellar names. If the answer is that the competition would become the domain of only lower-grade golfers, does that not undermine its Rolex status? There is also an ethical argument regarding why golfers, or any sportspeople of a certain financial level, should be paid simply to appear. In many ways, this surely contradicts the ethos of sport, albeit that such a point could be applied to money’s tight grasp of football, tennis and so many other enterprises.
This week in Dubai, Pelley and the European Tour will look to emphasise all that is good about what has long been regarded as the PGA Tour’s poor relation. They are perfectly correct to do that, even if some means by which Europe boosts its status raise questions.


Mauricio Pellegrino did not have the ideal start to his career as a Premier League manager. Virgil van Dijk in effect went on strike shortly after the Argentinian walked through the Southampton door, casting a cloud of uncertainty over pre-season as he tried to make a good first impression on his players. Perhaps it worked in Pellegrino’s favour that he comes across as an incredibly calm and philosophical character. He is also realistic and understands that the match at Liverpool on Saturday has put Van Dijk under the microscope again – not that he thinks it will affect his leading defender.
“I don’t think it will be difficult because Virgil knows he is focused 100% on our team and is training well,” Pellegrino says of a player who was primed to move to Anfield for £60m in June before a complaint of tapping up forced Liverpool into a humiliating climbdown. “He wants to improve his performances because he was injured in January and then he didn’t play any games. We cannot control the market and every single transfer window clubs are looking to buy our players. It’s part of our job. It’s no secret that sometimes players are distracted but it’s normal.”
Southampton’s start to the season has been a stuttering one, as Pellegrino has wrestled with the task of trying to stamp a new identity on a team that have hinted at progress before stalling again. They are 13th, having won three, drawn four and lost four, but with games at Liverpool and Manchester City comprising two of their next three fixtures, they will do well to hold that position. Pellegrino could be forgiven for being a little jumpy when asked about Southampton’s form so far but he is incredibly optimistic and prefers to focus on the positives. “The results? I am like the people, the fans, because you saw in the last game [a 1-0 defeat against Burnley] that we deserved a little bit more than the points we got,” he says. “Most of the games, like Burnley away, Swansea, Stoke or Manchester United, we deserved more because when we talk about two or three points in the Premier League, it’s massive. Between eighth and 17th last year there were six points. I think we are on the right track.”
His brief was to keep Southampton on an upward trajectory but at a club that have finished in the top 10 for the past four seasons that task always appeared to be a difficult one – particularly when Claude Puel was sacked in the summer after finishing eighth and reaching the League Cup final. But Pellegrino shrugs off the notion that he feels under pressure and smiles. He is relishing the challenge.
“I am really motivated because when I met the technical directors, Ross [Wilson] and Les [Reed], they told me that the club wants to grow – and for me that’s the most beautiful thing in our life: to try and be better tomorrow than today. But the big risk in football is to work in football. It’s like the biggest risk is to be alive, no?
“When you’re on the motorway, you are taking a big risk. But in our job to work in football we are living for results. I played football from my childhood and, OK, I got the feeling of success, of failure, to draw or win. When you win, OK, you are happy an hour and you have to train again and try to win again. When you are champion, you are happy for a day and after you have to train again to try to achieve another title. It’s part of our job, no?”
Pellegrino has never been one to look back on success or failure for too long, having experienced both at Valencia as a player (he won two league titles) and manager (he was sacked in 2012). Instead he prefers to learn from those experiences and move on. He is a studious type who believes in juego posicional (a positional game) having absorbed tactical ideas as a player under Louis van Gaal at Barcelona, where he also won La Liga, and Rafael Benítez at Valencia and Liverpool, where he was given a coaching job for the first time.
In Southampton’s last game, against Burnley, his side’s positional authority could be seen in the post-match stats. Saints enjoyed 63% possession and had twice as many shots as their opponents but could not score and lost 1-0. It has been the story of their stop-start season so far, with Manolo Gabbiadini’s two goals against Newcastle looking as if they might be the turning point only for the striker to retreat back into his goal‑shy shell again.
“When we think about the last 10 games we have had the same problem but we have to be more efficient,” Pellegrino says. “We need a really, really high number of chances to convert into goals. I cannot imagine [Sofiane] Boufal, [Nathan] Redmond, Gabbiadini or Dusan Tadic, running 90 minutes behind the ball. Our style of players are comfortable with the ball, close to the box. Sometimes the opponent has ideas and strengths and quality too and in the Premier League there are a group of teams where we are really tight. I think the connection we all have could not get any better.”
Pellegrino’s man-management is not in doubt. He’s a staunch believer in everyone – the cook, fans, kitman, himself – playing their part in a team’s success. It’s what worked so well at Alavés in La Liga, whom he guided to ninth place and the Copa del Rey final last season – a startlingly similar season to that of Puel at Southampton. Pellegrino hopes he can forge the same unity at his new club, where he has gathered all the Saints backroom staff together to take on a UK media XI in a game organised by the club’s main sponsor, Virgin Media. The club’s staff play every Friday to build a sense of togetherness. Pellegrino has a Zen quality about him as he calmly strides around in defence quelling any danger. He even nutmegs our striker while under pressure in his own penalty area. It’s a creative solution to a threatening problem.
He will need to be similarly inventive to solve the team’s problem of scoring goals but Pellegrino believes he is not far off doing so. “I have to try to adapt to my players to what I can do and I have to try to put my ideas on the pitch. It’s like a medium point between them and my belief. At the end, in football there is no truth, there is belief. When you want to [attack] more you have to be balanced but you have to think in the same way whether you attack or defend because in the end everything is connected. If you defend badly, it is really difficult to attack well. If you attack badly, it’s difficult to defend. We are a team that is comfortable when we manage the ball.”
Whether they can do that well enough to frustrate a Liverpool side who have won three games in a row remains to be seen but Pellegrino says Southampton are looking forward to playing at Anfield. “It’s a special place for me. I have good memories of this club as a player and as a coach. It was a wonderful moment in my life but in this case I would like to win the game,” he says. “The good thing in football is that it’s unpredictable. Sometimes the first thing that you have to do, you have to try to make them feel uncomfortable. When you play against one of the biggest teams, mentally for us it will be easier because everybody will be motivated to try and achieve something more. It is good because you can see how you are against one of the best teams in the Premier League. You think about [when we played] Manchester United, they scored one goal but they did not have many chances – I think we only conceded a couple of crosses but we have to continue the same way.”
Whether his team win or lose, it is hard to imagine Pellegrino’s mood changing much – his even-tempered outlook is refreshing in a league that so often thumps along to a bombastic beat. His message will need to remain consistent throughout what could be a testing period before Christmas but Southampton can take comfort in the fact that their manager approaches every day with his glass half full. “I am happy because right now I am totally out of my comfort zone. I love my job. I know there is a big pressure, a big risk, but I have to do it. All my life, it is the only thing I can do.”


Manchester United could lose Marouane Fellaini for free next summer after the midfielder refused to sign the new contract the club offered him in September.
Negotiations have been under way since last season on a deal, with Fellaini unhappy at the terms offered. The Belgian is thought to earn around £120,000 a week after United triggered a one-year extension in January and raised his salary from £80,000 a week. He wants a marked increase on his terms.
Despite the stance, José Mourinho will not sanction the 29-year-old’s sale in the January window even if Fellaini has still not agreed a fresh deal by then. As the former Everton man is out of contract in the summer and United do no hold any options to trigger an automatic extension he would be free to sign a pre-contract agreement with any club outside the Premier League in January. Player contract regulations stipulate they can negotiate a transfer six months before their current agreement expires.
Fellaini has emerged as a key part of Mourinho’s team, after he endured a difficult start when signing for David Moyes for £27.5m in the summer of 2013. The Portuguese manager is intent that the midfielder should extend his stay at the club. Despite the protracted discussions and the impasse Mourinho has not given up hope Fellaini will agree to sign on again.
Yet if he does not do so then United face the prospect of a player who turns 30 next week, and so is in his prime, walking away for nothing.


Enable added another prize to her five Group One wins during the 2017 Flat season on Tuesday night when, to no one’s great surprise, she picked up the horse of the year gong at the Cartier Awards dinner in London. John Gosden’s filly, who picked up two Classics and the Prix de l’Arc de Triomphe between June and October, emerged triumphant from a shortlist that also included Ulysses, Ribchester and her stable companion Cracksman, who was the only serious rival for the title after his seven-length romp in the Champion Stakes at Ascot.
Cracksman did not go unrewarded, as he was named the top three-year-old colt, while there were also prizes for Ulysses (older horse) and Harry Angel (sprinter) at the event which the organisers like to describe as “European racing’s equivalent of the Oscars”. The focus on Europe, though, does mean that there was no mention of Winx, the undisputed star of Australian racing, or Arrogate, who is still on top of the Longines World’s Best Racehorse rankings for 2017 despite having been beaten in his final three starts after winning the Dubai World Cup back in March.
It will be interesting to see how the international handicappers juggle the numbers before the World’s Best Racehorse award ceremony in January. Arrogate’s win at Meydan still has a very fair claim to be the best individual performance by any thoroughbred in 2017, despite being registered at a time when European Flat racing has barely opened its eyes, never mind clambered out of bed. But it would also seem very strange were he to be named the world’s best racehorse for the second year running, given his thorough failure to back it up during the remainder of the global campaign.
Enable had not even set foot on a racecourse this time last year and did not make her debut until 28 November, when she ran out the easy winner of a one-mile fillies’ maiden race on the Tapeta at Newcastle.
With that in mind, Kings Shield is an interesting runner for the Gosden yard when he starts his racing career at the same track this afternoon. The son of Scat Daddy was the top lot at the Craven Breeze-Up sale earlier this year, when a fierce bidding battle was eventually won by David Redvers, bidding on behalf of Qatar Racing, at 675,000gns.
Kings Shield is a half-brother to Great White Eagle, a Group Three winner who, oddly enough, was the top lot at the same sale in 2013, and is the narrow favourite to make a winning debut later today. However, he faces a stern opponent in Ostilio (4.15), who showed plenty of promise when beaten by half a length on his first start at Leicester last month, and Simon Crisford’s colt is the obvious one to take advantage if Kings Shield is in need of the experience this afternoon.
Lord Of The Glen (4.45) is still a maiden after 10 starts but he showed improved form to finish just a nose behind Cuppacoco in a nursery last time out with the third horse more than three lengths adrift. He will be hard to beat today if he can back that up.
If The Cap Fits (2.20) was one of the best bumper horses last season and made a deeply impressive debut over hurdles at Exeter last month. He should add another win to his record on a good card at Bangor-on-Dee this afternoon, while Cool Sky (2.50) and Sir Mangan (1.45) also have solid chances on the same card. Yanworth (3.00) is the class act down at Exeter but will set off at very cramped odds to remain unbeaten over fences, so Wicked Willy (2.30) makes more appeal at a working person’s price.

The day ended in the same manner it had started in Australia – with a resounding, deafening “yes”. The roar from the ANZ Stadium crowd as captain Mile Jedinak three times found the back of the net in an ultimately comfortable 3-1 win over Honduras matched those around the country when the nation’s marriage equality survey result was announced earlier on Wednesday.
The Socceroos are going to next year’s World Cup in Russia, their fourth successive finals, after ending a mammoth qualifying campaign that saw Ange Postecoglou’s side play 22 games over 884 days and travel more than 250,000 kilometres to 22 countries. This campaign has been nothing if not an epic journey.
They didn’t make it easy for themselves and will rue the missed opportunity to qualify automatically at the end of the group stage, a failure that added yet more air miles and another four games to their circuitous route to Russia. But Jedinak’s 53rd minute free-kick and two coolly-converted penalties finally, memorably, secured his side’s passage to Russia on a momentous day in the nation’s history.
This game was the epitome of a must-win match, not just in terms of qualification but also in terms of the longer-term ramifications for football in Australia. Given the destabilising effect recent political infighting among the domestic game’s stakeholders has already had, defeat and failure to qualify for the World Cup was unthinkable. Then there is the question of cash – the tidy sum of $12.5m paid out by Fifa for qualification is not to be sniffed at, particularly at a time when FFA need it most.
Yet question marks remain over the future of Postecoglou, and whether he will be in charge once the flight departs for Russia next year. As expected, the coach refused to deflect from the glory of the night and did not confirm or deny speculation he will leave his post before the finals. That particular storyline will be played out over the next few days, once the hangovers wear off and the euphoria dies down.
Rarely one to stick to a starting lineup – he has sent out the same side just once during his tenure – Postecoglou promised changes in Sydney, and true to his word there were four. Tim Cahill’s ability to change a game in a snap of his neck muscles was backed from the start, while Mark Milligan and Mathew Leckie returned from suspension. Tom Rogic, who began on the bench in San Pedro Sula, also came in.
Postecoglou had also indicated his side would “go hard” in the second leg and with six players lining up on the halfway line for kick-off, home intentions were immediately clear. But a briskly optimistic opening soon gave way to the beginnings of frustration as the visitors attempted to take the sting out of the Socceroos early fervour.
Yet Aaron Mooy and Tom Rogic, Australia’s most influential players, were able to give indications of their skills. Huddersfield midfielder Mooy’s free-kick on 13 minutes raised pulses in the Honduras box before the ball was parried to safety by goalkeeper Donis Escober and the first real chance of the night fell to Rogic, who scuffed his shot after good work by Cahill at the byline had played in Aziz Behich.
For Honduras, forays into the Australian half were few and far between and it took half an hour for the returning Alberth Elis, the visitors’ most dynamic player who missed out on the first leg through suspension, to show what he is capable of going forward. Otherwise, as an attacking entity, Honduras were barely existent.
If coach Jorge Luis Pinto’s gameplan was to play for extra-time and the lottery of penalties, it worked – for the first half at least. But with the Socceroos enjoying far more possession, there was a degree of inevitability to the first goal.
Jedinak was the architect as his free-kick took a hefty deflection off Henry Figueroa, on as a substitute and to be later brought back off, and wrong-footed Escober. There was some confusion as to who to award the goal to, but the Aston Villa midfielder was later credited.
Cahill, full of running but with little opportunity to display his nose for goal, did go close soon after the opener went in. His looping header from nearly the edge of the penalty area bounced on top of the crossbar.
Yet with the score just 1-0, and given the vagaries of the away goals rule, the game still rested on a knife edge. Australia needed a second. It came from Jedinak again, with 18 minutes remaining, after Bryan Acosta was adjudged to have handled in the area, perhaps unjustly. With the pressure on, the skipper made light of any nerves he may have been suffering and slotted home.
He was to repeat the trick on 85 minutes, this time after Robbie Kruse was hauled down in the box, to complete his hat-trick and a consummate captain’s performance.
Honduras grabbed a late consolation, through a scrambled effort involving Elis and later credited by Fifa to Maynor Figueroa, but it meant nothing. The day had already been won.
Pre-match logic suggested that if the Socceroos could not beat Honduras at home, they did not deserve to rub shoulders with the world’s best in Russia next year. By extension, this victory fully justifies their place. They might have taken their time on a long, circuitous route and given their supporters hell through the process, but their objective has been completed. They made it.


“Who needs Stokes when you’ve got Woakes?” came the cry from the grandstand at Townsville’s charming Tony Ireland Stadium, on the day when England even got an unexpected first look at their third rhyming all-rounder, Ben Foakes. It was far from the day’s most inane Ben Stokes-based sledge England were sent and had at least a morsel of truth – even if both really would be handy – because Chris Woakes bowled beautifully in taking six for 58 as the callow Cricket Australia XI reached stumps on 249 for nine.
Woakes bowls as quickly as anyone England have here and looked even tastier than he did in Adelaide. At a toss conducted by the mayor, which was followed by a bit of didgeridoo action, England were asked to bowl and Woakes was pleased with their efforts on another painfully placid surface. “We had to be patient,” he said. “We felt like we had to sit in for a while and force them to make a mistake. It’s flat, and slow in pace. A Test wicket will be quicker than that.”
He was delighted that they found swing, even with the Kookaburra ball, and believes – with all the talk about whether bowlers are under- or overcooked – that he is peaking at the right time. “All the numbers are saying I’m getting close to getting cooked,” he said. “I’m pleased with where my body is at and getting overs in the legs is important.”
Having bowled five luckless overs with the new ball (which, of course, he should not get too attached to), Woakes twice struck with the first ball of later spells. The first of those spells started shortly before lunch, with CA cruising at 66 without loss, and brought four for eight in 22 balls either side of the break.
Nick Larkin, the owner of the only first-class century in CA’s side, and Jake Carder had played well enough but Woakes dismissed them in successive overs to leave the lunch score 82 for two. Larkin was caught very well by James Vince in the gully, above head height and diving, while Carder was caught behind fending.
Woakes’s next wicket was caught behind too but by a different keeper. In the over after lunch a Woakes delivery scuttled and caught Jonny Bairstow on his left middle finger, causing bruising that forced him from the field fearing worse. After 10 minutes of treatment and changing, Foakes appeared to stand in. This would not have been possible just a few weeks ago – the MCC overturned the rule preventing 12th men from acting as wicketkeeper in October.
Foakes was out there for 11 overs across 50 minutes, as mild panic calmed about Bairstow’s condition – if England are to stand a chance in Stokes’s absence, they must keep ship-shape the keeper and remaining all-rounders, Moeen Ali and Woakes, who said he had not even been concerned enough about the injury to check on the condition of his room-mate on tour. Fifty minutes was long enough for Foakes, who might well have played 30 Tests by now were he Australian, to tidily take Ryan Gibson. Woakes’s tight line earned that wicket and he had Jason Sangha lbw two balls later, too.
Some resistance followed from Matt Short and Harry Nielsen but Woakes made the latter his fifth wicket, again caught well by Vince in the gully (where he would sharply take Gurinder Sandhu late on to give Stuart Broad a wicket, too). Woakes’s sixth was Simon Milenko, who looked good in Adelaide but was at sea here. He had his leg stump removed by the new ball’s first delivery. Both Nielsen and Milenko had been ruffled by Woakes’s short ball.
Moeen saw his first competitive action of the tour in the 11th over of the match and proved capable of plugging an end without producing many chances, while his side caused him no obvious discomfort. Mason Crane was less tidy but recovered well and had the captain, Short, dropped twice off his bowling. On 25, he cut hard to Mark Stoneman close at point, with the fielder doing well just to get a hand to it, but Joe Root’s opportunity when he had 36 was far simpler at slip. Straight in, straight out. Slip to the spinner is another hole left by Stokes’s absence.
Root did eventually snaffle Short, who poked Craig Overton to second slip promptly after bringing up a neat 118-ball half-century. Crane took some raucously received tap late on from Dan Fallins, with the final over of the day slogged for 16. Alastair Cook, short on runs, might privately have been relieved that CA ended the day nine down.
Even as Jake Ball’s comeback from injury continued by bowling off a few paces in the nets, Overton – who had earlier had Will Pucovski caught behind – took another step towards the Test side. While he has no great pace, he has an action that is repeatable and reminiscent of Tim Bresnan and a swift bouncer, and he has proven mighty tricky to score off since finding the right length in Adelaide last week – here, his 18 overs cost just 32. England have really found one if his impact is anything like Bresnan’s in 2010-11.


Georgia arrived in Cardiff this week after a six-hour journey from Tbilisi via Istanbul, but their head coach, Milton Haig, fears they are in no man’s land. They have outgrown the tier two European Nations tournament, but the door to the Six Nations remains closed.
Their success has earned them one match against a tier one country in non-World Cup years, but their match against Wales on Saturday is sandwiched between encounters with Canada and the United States. The danger for Georgia is that the marked progress they have made under Haig, who took over after the 2011 World Cup, will stall because they have nowhere to go.
“The European Nations does not push us as it should do,” said Haig, an avuncular 53-year-old New Zealander who started his senior coaching career as Vern Cotter’s assistant at Bay of Plenty and recommended his successor, Joe Schmidt. “When we get to the November window, we find the gulf between that level and tier one is astronomical. We have had five of these games since 2011, less than half Fiji and Samoa have had, and the question that has to be asked is where is our progression?
“We have shown in the last two years that we have outgrown the European Nations, with no disrespect to the likes of Russia and a team we lost to earlier this year, Romania, but we have reached the stage where we put 54 points on Canada, as we did last week, and I am not happy because the performance was not good enough. We are doing all that is expected of us and I would love to have another match against a leading side after Wales because we could measure ourselves. How do we gauge improvement?”
Italy were in the same position as Georgia when they made the Five Nations six in 2000, as were Argentina when they became part of the Rugby Championship in 2012. Both countries had to serve a long apprenticeship and while World Rugby, all the more so since Agustín Pichot has been vice-chairman, has been intent on giving emerging nations a leg up, it is down to the unions who make up the Six Nations to create a new member.
“I think we have some hope of getting into the Six Nations,” said Haig. “There have been conversations and the new chief executive of the Rugby Football Union [Stephen Brown] has said that it may be time to look at Georgia coming in. That makes how we perform against Wales and Italy next year important, but we appreciate the number one priority is commercial viability. When I arrived in Georgia, you could sponsor the national jersey for $10,000; it costs a bit more now. We have support and regularly get gates of 50,000 and we have a number of partners.”
The backers include the Montpellier owner Mohed Altrad, who supports a club in Georgia and had helped out at under-20 level. Haig’s squad spent three days in camp in the city where Cotter is now based after a stint with Scotland at the start of the month to prepare for their autumn series. “An amazing fact about Georgian rugby is that we only have 11,000 registered players from the age of 15 upwards,” said Haig. “The number is growing because parents, who follow football, have come to appreciate rugby’s values. In the summer, I watched a village under-15 side take on a school from Wales and put 50 points on them, playing some terrific rugby with even props throwing long passes.
“I asked a development officer what had happened and he said a stadium had been built in the village with floodlights and the kids were attracted to it like moths to a flame. When I arrived in Georgia we only had two grounds up to standard; now we have at least 16. At that time, we were behind the likes of Samoa, Canada and the USA, but we have beaten them all and attracted a strong following: the game against Wales is being televised live, free-to-air, and five companies bid for it.”
Haig will be pitting his gameplan against a fellow New Zealander on Saturday, Warren Gatland, as he did last year in Scotland when Cotter was in charge and in 2014 when Georgia faced Schmidt’s Ireland. “We had a coaches’ meeting during the last World Cup and someone remarked it was like a provincial championship gathering of 15 years before because there were so many New Zealanders,” he said. “There are not many full-time jobs in New Zealand: they told me to go abroad to get experience and then bring it back home.”
Haig is contracted to Georgia until the end of 2019 and has fallen in love with the country. He lives there with his wife and two daughters, the eldest of whom, a gymnast, speaks the language fluently. “It is a great place with wonderful food,” he said. “The driving is a bit idiosyncratic, but you get four proper seasons, cold winters and hot summers with beautiful springs and autumns.”
He has developed a strong management team, backed up by two Australians, Richard Graham, who had stints with Australia, Saracens and Bath, and Brad Harris, a New Zealand kicking coach, Dean Cummins, and a Georgian defence coach, Levan Maisashvili, who spends time at Saracens as the club has ties with a Georgian side. A number of players, all forwards apart from two scrum-halves, play in France’s Top 14 or the Premiership, but most of the rest are part-timers based in Georgia.
“They spend two mornings a week with us,” said Haig. “A month before the start of a competition or Test window. When I watched Georgia in the 2011 World Cup, they were one-dimensional: a big pack and half-backs who did not involve the backs. That has changed and it is down to coaching. I would like all the players to be playing top-level club rugby, but those who do not are not handicapped because the coaching they get is at least as good as they would get in France or England. They only get paid if they make the squad and what drives them is playing for their country, one reason we have never had problems getting players released by French clubs.”
Georgia are in Wales’s World Cup pool in 2019 by which time Haig expects them to be competitive, at the very least. “We are a much better side than we were even in 2015,” he said. “A year ago, we lost in Scotland on an artificial pitch which suited them more than us, but ultimately it comes down to confidence and belief.
“We played Argentina in the summer, a fixture they gave us knowing where we were coming from, and I said to the players before the game to believe they could win. Not all of them went out there with that mindset and we gifted Argentina four early penalties, but at the end of the match, which we lost by 16 points, they realised it could have been different and that they were able to compete.
“Where we are now is that it is a genuine contest to win the game. Wales will be formidable whatever team they pick because of their rugby history, but they have not had it all their own way against tier two teams in recent years, beating Japan last year with a late drop goal. While we will respect them, I have said to our guys: Why not us? They have worked hard so why not create an upset? If you do not believe you can win, you start with a deficit and as a New Zealander, that is not my way. We have talked about Scotland and the difference this year is the expectation players have of themselves. They can play and we need the rugby world to know that.”

“On Saturday 4 November at Stoke City’s 2–2 draw with Leicester, Stoke’s two goals were scored by Xherdan Shaqiri and Peter Crouch,” writes Robin Wiles. “Has there ever been a greater disparity in the heights of players scoring goals for the same team in the same match?”
Not only is it not the biggest height difference to happen ever, it is not even the greatest this season. Nor is it the largest disparity to take place for Stoke this season, as Chai points out: “According to reliable sources (Wikipedia), Peter Crouch’s height is 2.01m (6ft 7in) and Xherdan Shaqiri is 1.69m (5ft 6in), a difference of 32cm. When Stoke won 4-0 against Rochdale in the Carabao Cup on 24 August this season, the height difference between two scorers was a whopping 33cm. Peter Crouch (again) towered over Stoke’s captain for the day, the 1.68m (5ft 5in) Joe Allen.” A reminder that every centimetre counts.
Chai also states how Crouch is at the centre of these height disparities. “Speaking of Crouch (again), when he and the 1.65m (5ft 4in) Aaron Lennon scored for Tottenham in the 9-1 Premier League demolition of Wigan on 23 November 2009, the height difference was 36cm.” Prior to this, many would have remembered this game for Jermain Defoe netting five second-half goals, but not now. This isn’t the last mention of Crouch, mind, as he equalled the 36cm-mark playing alongside Shaun Wright-Phillips for England, as Navin Patel points out. The duo found the scoresheet together on two separate occasions for their country: firstly against Belarus in 2009 and then as second-half subs in a friendly with Egypt a year later.
Now, however, would be a good time to introduce the 2.04m (6ft 8in) Tor Hogne Aarøy from Norway, who spent a season playing for Jef United in Japan, where he formed a classic ‘big man, little man’ partnership with Makai Fukai, who stands at just 1.61m (5ft 3in), a whole 43cm below his Scandinavian team-mate. They both scored in a 3-0 win over Giravanz Kitakyushu and a 2-1 victory against Kataller Toyama in the second division back in 2011.
Last week’s list of rappers referencing football in their lyrics prompted write the response. Here we go …
Neil Caraher was among a number of correspondents to point us in the direction of Manchester United fan Stormzy, who has a warning for West Ham in this line from his track ‘Know Me From’: “I come to your team and I fuck shit up. I’m David Moyes.” But Jason Clarke reckons “the greatest ever footballer reference has to be in Roots Manuva’s Duppy Writer”. Stand back and admire: “To my boys that hassle banks like Jimmy Floyd, Natwest, TSB and Abbey make some noise.” Oof! Time to check in on the social media side …
Glaring omission from football rap lyrics section in @TheKnowledge_GU:Just let me get the stress that is on my chest off.Cos my head's a mess like Joleon Lescott.👂 https://t.co/OsKbA9Ts10
@TheKnowledge_GU you can't forget this Black Josh classic...https://t.co/fteFKhht9X
No mention of Lee Scott? Shame!"I’m slick - like a Johnny Barnes scissor kick,Round ours Robbie’s God and Grobbelaar’s Innocent"
Pranjal Tiwariis is probably correct in saying: “I might be the only one who remembers this but the 1999 German hip-hop track ‘MC Gladiator’ by Zweimal Das Gleiche contains this line: ‘Ich komm cleaner als Jürgen Klinsmann, hab nie allzu weite Jeans an’ which translates as: ‘I come cleaner than Jürgen Klinsmann, I never have baggy jeans on’.” O … K.
“There is a huge section of German rap referring to footballers and clubs,” writes Arto Arman. “Luciano, for example, has several tracks dedicated to Premier League players. Here’s a line from one, titled Riyad Mahrez: ‘Surprise, just like Leicester … Riyad Mahrez … Being broke was yesterday’s problem … Riyad Mahrez … Coming for you like Leicester … Riyad Mahrez … Surprise, just like Leicester … Riyad Mahrez.’” So far, so bad. Any more, Arto? Oh, there are more. In a track called Okocha/Banditorinho, Luciano makes his pitch for a Grammy with this killer opening line: “Laces kick like Moussa Sissoko,” and then mentions Geoffrey Kondogbia, Breel Embolo and Didier Drogba for some reason or other.
“I think I’m a bit late in replying to this but the gig has only just been announced.” Tell us more, Raj Patel. “Next June, Steps will be performing at Peterborough United’s London Road (currently known as the Abax stadium). If this wasn’t enough to make you part with your money, they’ll be supported by fellow music legends Aqua and Blue. Unfortunately I’ll have to miss it as I’ve just bought tickets for a slightly more conventional band/football ground combo playing the same weekend, Guns ‘n’ Roses at Berlin’s Olympic Stadium. Disappointing.”
“I know teams these days tend to wear even a new away kit at the first opportunity at home as a form of advertising,” wrote Simon Horner in 2012, “but has there ever been a kit that, due to a lack of colour clashes, has never been worn?”
While there were a whole multitude of shirts produced in the 90s that should never have seen the light of the day due to their eyeball-bleeding ugliness, Fiorentina’s was perhaps the only one banned on political grounds. It took until December of the 1992-93 season before anyone noticed that the club’s away kit included (presumably unintentional) swastikas. The kit was quickly withdrawn. “Fiorentina and the manufacturers, Lotto, would like to underline that the optical effect [of a swastika image] is purely a matter of chance,” culpa mea-ed the club in a statement.
Of course, Fiorentina actually played in that kit – which doesn’t answer Simon’s question – but Jon Waite brought us news of kits that never saw competitive action beyond a seven year-old winger down the park. “The FA produced a sky-blue version of the 1990 World Cup shirt (as famously modelled by Barney Sumner in the World in Motion video) that was never worn in a fixture,” wrote Jon. “A different sky-blue third kit was worn once in a qualifier in Turkey a year later when Dennis Wise scored the winner.”
Jon also nominated QPR’s third kit from the 1989-90 season, a jazzy black and orange number – their away kit was red and black and the lack of colour clashes meant it was left mouldering on the dressing-room shelves. They also had an unused third kit in 1991-92, which will be familiar to fans of a certain Glasgow club. “It has been long rumoured that this kit was nixed by two senior professionals at the club, Ray Wilkins and Alan McDonald,” said Jon. “Wilkins was still revered at Rangers from his time as a player there and McDonald was an east Belfast boy, long time Rangers fan and Northern Ireland captain. Both allegedly refused to wear the shirt for fear of upsetting friends in high places.”
“Watching Blue Planet 2 and its oddly monikered cock-eyed squid got me wondering: are there any species (plant, animal, bacteria) named after footballers or teams?” wonders Edan Tal. “Hoping for an Allardycius that flourishes under intense pressures.”
“Guitar-toting indie tyro Jake Bugg is sponsoring Notts County’s kit throughout November. Is this the first time an individual has been a professional club’s shirt sponsor?” asks Gregg Bakowski.
“What is the shortest time between a player featuring for an age group national team and the full team?” tweets Nathan Eaton.
“Recently a rather excellent book has been launched called ‘Rocket Men’ that profiles the four players (Luther Blissett, Ross Jenkins, Ian Bolton, Steve Sherwood) who played for Watford in all four divisions during the meteoric rise under Graham Taylor,” notes Simon Devon. “Jenkins’s story has one extra twist – he played for Watford in games where they were 92nd in the league (on 23 August 1975 and 30 August 1975) and top of the First Division (31 August 1982). Has any other player achieved this with one club?”
“Bologna’s Simone Verdi recently scored twice on direct free-kicks, each from about 25 metres out, but one with the left foot and one with the right,” explains Ben Garnham. “Has anyone else scored two free-kicks in one game with different feet?”
“Harrogate Town were formed in 1914 and, due to the first world war, didn’t play their first competitive game until 1919,” writes David Jolly. “Has any team waited longer to play their first game?”
@TheKnowledge_GU In the village of Tomer, right on the Israeli-Jordanian border, there is a football pitch at an approximate height of 270 meters BELOW sea level. Is that the lowest football pitch on earth?
@TheKnowledge_GU My predictions league have a temperature theme this week, are there records of the extremes that matches have been played in? ♨️❄️


What’s a brother gotta do to catch a break in sports? Asking not for myself, a black sportswriter, but for a friend. OK, not for a friend. For DeShone Kizer, the beleaguered rookie quarterback of the terrible Cleveland Browns.
Early one Saturday morning last month Kizer ducked into a downtown bar for a break, a bit of release. The pressure on him at the time surely pinched, what with the Browns being 0-6 and his passer rating at a league-worst 27.3. He is of legal drinking age, didn’t break any laws and didn’t violate any sacrosanct policies held by the team. But a Zapruder-grade Snapchat video emerged of Kizer at the bar – although he looks less like a starting NFL quarterback than a rebel prep-schoolboy as he attempts conversation on the fringe of a loud and crowded dance floor.
A local TV station went on to cover the story like it was the Paradise Papers. Naturally, these findings quickly found their way into a news conference with the Browns coach, Hue Jackson, who was sympathetic to Kizer at first. “A guy’s personal time is his personal time,” he said. “I’d be surprised if that happened. I don’t think DeShone has that kind of character or personality that way.”
But when a reporter from the station that scored the video insisted to Jackson that, yes, not only did this night out happen, but “to a guy trying to learn the playbook”, the coach shifted support. “You’re right,” he told the reporter. “I appreciate you guys sharing that with me.”
You’d think that Jackson, a man who makes a living breaking down tape, could see the Kizer video for the gotcha moment that it is. You’d think that Jackson, a black coach, could appreciate how often black athletes feature in such gotcha moments. But, no. Confirmation bias against black athletes is so pervasive that it’s practically conventional wisdom. Even when they don’t do anything wrong, they must be guilty of something.
It’s a pretzeled logic that springs from decades of media conditioning – or so reasons Dr Cynthia Frisby, the University of Missouri’s School of Journalism professor behind a 2016 study that examines how black male athletes are portrayed in the media. After analyzing a decade’s worth of clippings, she found that black athletes received “significantly more negative coverage” – hard news stories about domestic and sexual violence, in other words. Meanwhile, their white counterparts – the minority group in the landscape of big-time sports, ironically – get the opposite: softball features about drive and commitment.
What’s more, the sisters can’t catch a break either. In the last four months alone we’ve seen Serena Williams caricatured in antiquated style, as a big ol’ brute – this time in a recent memoir by Maria Sharapova, an oft-vanquished peer who happens to be five inches taller than the American. And we’ve seen Simone Biles shamed for having the audacity to go on holiday after dominating the gymnastics at the Rio Olympics. We’ve been reminded that black athletes can be everything: grand slam champions, Olympic gold medalists, explosive, magic. Everything, that is, except benign.
Kevin Durant knows. Last month the Golden State Warriors forward was ejected from a road game against the Memphis Grizzlies, and heckled by fans on his way out. To silence them, he raised his ring finger, a nod to the championship he led the Warriors to last season, and was immediately accused of flipping off the crowd. The confirmation bias was obvious, so much that Durant had to laugh about it afterward: “I’m sure everyone thinks I’m the angry black athlete,” he said.
How could he not be when we’ve been conditioned to believe that the angry black athlete can literally be every one. They can be Curt Flood or Muhammad Ali or Colin Kaepernick, entitled to their anger. They can be Latrell Sprewell or Terrell Owens or Floyd Mayweather, hot-blooded. They can be Durant, the mama’s boy who delivered one of the all-time Hallmark moments in sports with his league MVP acceptance speech three years ago. Ultimately it won’t matter because they all look the same – like “inmates running the prison”.
Those, of course, were the immortal words Houston Texans owner Bob McNair used in reference to NFL players using the national anthem as a platform to protest a justice system that’s equally demonizing of black men. Frisby’s study underscored this point in her survey, which cites research that arrived at three dominant media images of black men: entertainers, athletes and criminals. Donald Trump also underscored this point when he dismissed genuflecting players as sons of bitches. Kizer, among those protesters, was quick to respond. “I’m no son of a bitch,” he said.
Both McNair and Trump clearly spoke for the legion of white Americans that have tuned out NFL football in reaction – an ESPN survey found most whites disagree with the protests and TV ratings are down. The entire pretext of that closed-door NFL owners meeting where McNair spoke those words was about the desire for control, the urgent and evergreen agenda item yoked to seemingly every conversation about black athletes.
One can hardly imagine white athletes being so infantilized. Rob Gronkowski thrives on his party animal reputation (although much of that may be artful self-promotion: he does not drink alcohol during the season) while his fellow NFL tight end Travis Kelce is known for his hot temper and brash persona. Joe Namath owned a piece of a New York nightclub while on the Jets roster. When they talk about burning the candle at both ends, no one calls them immature. They don’t have to keep winning to justify their night-owling the way Michael Jordan and Lawrence Taylor, the New York Giants’ Hall of Fame linebacker, had to. They get grace. Richie Incognito can leave a voicemail for his Miami Dolphins team-mate calling him “a half-nigger piece of shit”, and get another job with the Buffalo Bills after the scandal dies down. Tony Stewart’s career as a Nascar star and team co-owner can cruise along, with minimal interruption, even after he runs over and kills someone during an amateur event (the death was later ruled an accident). Johnny Manziel, the Heisman trophy winner turned NFL flameout, gets grace – gets called a good kid who just needs to grow up.
Kizer? He’s the irresponsible quarterback. Never mind if his excursion, late as it was, was likely the first night off he’d earnestly taken for himself since being drafted by the Browns last April. (Kizer is a triple threat: he can run, he can pass and he’s harder on himself than any coach.) Never mind that he can’t go looking for trouble, not with a bailiff for a mother and a police officer for a father. Never mind that Kizer “was at the facility the next day, preparing for the [Titans] game”.
His sweat equity is starting to pay off. On the road against the Detroit Lions last Sunday, Kizer posted a career day (232 yards passing, 57 more rushing and a pair of touchdowns through the air and on the ground) and had the Browns trending toward a win before he was briefly knocked out of the game late in the third quarter with a rib injury.
Cleveland eventually fell 38-24 but the game showed that the Browns can be competitive if their receivers don’t drop Kizer’s passes, a chemistry problem that has plagued the team all season. Kizer’s prime target is Kenny Britt, a dazzling if mischievous talent who for whatever reason (maybe a knee injury) hasn’t been able to connect with his quarterback all season. Britt and another misfit receiver, an injured second-year man named Corey Coleman, were out with Kizer on the night the Snapchat video was filmed. Rounding out their party were linebacker Christian Kirksey and two native Ohioans who play for the Kansas City Chiefs: running back Kareem Hunt and Kelce, the aforementioned party animal. So this wasn’t a true night out for Kizer. This was maybe a team-building exercise, or a chance to talk shop outside of shop walls.
Kizer, and black athletes like him, deserve the benefit of the doubt. I can’t wait to see the day that they finally get it.


There was considerable outrage in New South Wales when the organisers of the 2017 Rugby League World Cup largely snubbed the sport’s undisputed capital, Sydney, handing the city only two group games due to the local government’s reported lack of financial commitment.
However, while this weekend’s quarter-finals take place in Darwin, Christchurch, Melbourne and Wellington, there will still be a significant rugby league presence in Sydney over the next fortnight as the world’s best women players do battle in their own World Cup, that tournament’s fifth edition.
While some of the men’s teams have attracted criticism from their own players about the low pay-rates for playing in their World Cup, not even the biggest and best teams in the women’s tournament offer their players any payment to represent their country. They do it for the love, not the money – an attitude which comprises the backbone of women’s rugby league at present. “I’d have paid my own way out here if I’d had to,” says Danika Priim, the Bradford forward who was only convinced to try her hand at switching to rugby league from union two years ago after being asked to give it a go.
“I’m a PE teacher and yeah, I can’t lie, I’ve had to give up my wages and take unpaid leave from work for this,” she says. “Who wouldn’t, though? It’s the chance of a lifetime – it’s not ideal having to take time off work … but the girls are well supported by their employers, and the school have been great with me.”
Priim is an integral part of an England side who, much like their male counterparts, are looking to buck the Anzac trend at the World Cup. The first three tournaments were won by New Zealand before Australia won the event for the first time in 2013. But women’s rugby league is quietly growing in the UK. This year, Bradford won the first-ever Women’s Super League – a competition which will expand in 2018 when big names such as Widnes, Leeds and Wigan join the women’s revolution.
“The sport has gone from zero to hero in such a short space of time,” Priim says. “We’re trying to bring things in line with the men as much as possible, and we’re getting there.”
The growth of the game in this country gives Priim belief that England can go all the way at this World Cup. To do so, they will have to not finish bottom of a pool that also contains Australia and the Cook Islands.
Pool B features New Zealand, Papua New Guinea and, for the first time, Canada. Sydney hosts all the group games and both semi-finals.
There is quite the prize awaiting England should they reach the final, though. Crowds do not run much higher than the hundreds in the Women’s Super League at present; it’s even unclear how high the pick-up in interest will be for the World Cup in Sydney given their rejection of the men’s tournament.
But the final will be played as part of a double-header with the men’s World Cup final in Brisbane on 2 December, in front of more than 50,000 people.
“That’s the aim for us,” says Priim. “It’s an exciting prize awaiting us if we can get the job done – an England-Australia double-header would be nice, wouldn’t it?”
England’s campaign begins on Thursday against PNG, followed by games against the Jillaroos on Sunday and the Cook Islands next Wednesday. Should they reach the final, they would match the England women’s rugby union team, who lost their own World Cup final to New Zealand in the summer. The union side received mainstream media attention and a primetime TV slot – the rugby league side are unlikely to receive the same level of publicity, but it would certainly pique the interest of many should they get that far.
“There’s no pay but we’re setting the platform for future years, I think,” Priim adds. “We’re a bit of an unknown quantity, both the team and the sport in this country. Hopefully we can change that over the next few weeks.”


Once again England lined up with a two-man attack, with the difference from the encounter with Germany being it was Marcus Rashford and not Tammy Abraham who started alongside Jamie Vardy. The 20-year-old had spoken prior to kick-off of his preference of being part of a strike partnership and he linked up well with Vardy. With Harry Kane to return, there is only one starting place available should Gareth Southgate persevere with a front two and, as such, potential candidates have to impress when given the chance. Vardy and Rashford both did that here and for the head coach that is no bad thing as he looks to keep his players on their toes ahead of World Cup squad selection.
Joe Hart earned his 75th cap and it was an important evening for the 30-year-old. His position as England’s No1 is under serious threat due to a combination of poor form, Jack Butland’s return from long-term injury and the emergence of Jordan Pickford. Hart needed to put in a solid display and overall he did that, with his standout moment being a good reaction stop to prevent Phillippe Coutinho scoring on 47 minutes. Generally, however, Hart had little to deal with and he will know that Butland and Pickford continue to breathe down his neck, with the latter surely in pole position to be England’s starting goalkeeper when they travel to Amsterdam in four months.
The focus prior to kick-off was, justifiably, on Brazil’s attacking talent but on a night of few chances and sporadic spells of scintillating play, the eye was drawn to the visitors’ defensive capabilities. Tite has made this side more robust, seen by the paltry 11 goals they conceded in 18
World Cup qualifying games, and that was again on show here, with the two centre-backs, Miranda and Marquinhos, dominant with their front-foot defending and solid with their positioning, while in midfield Casemiro, Paulinho and Renato Augusto were regularly aggressive and disciplined. Brazil’s balance is near perfect and barring a catalogue of injuries, they will be a major threat in Russia next summer.
Ruben Loftus-Cheek’s early withdrawal was a setback for Southgate and an even bigger one for the player, who would have hoped to build on his decent showing against Germany. There were some nice touches from the 21-year-old before he departed and the question now is whether he will be involved when England play next. By then, Dele Alli and Adam Lallana should be available for selection and, as such, a midfield spot may not be open to the youngster. However, in general, his call-up to the senior setup has been encouraging and all he can do is continue to impress for Crystal Palace between now and England’s friendly with Holland in March.
So ends England’s 2017 and overall it has been a positive calendar year for the national team. Yes there were negatives, namely the evening in Paris when they were beaten and outplayed by France, and the victory in Malta when dissatisfied visiting supporters could be seen heading for the exits before the end, but this was also the year England qualified for the World Cup with ease and Southgate introduced fresh faces to his squad while attempting to implement a more progressive style of play. The sense of renewal is tangible and while it may all come crumbling down next summer, for now there should be measured optimism surrounding England going into 2018.


World Cup cycles normally end with the World Cup finals and only then begin anew. But after a disastrous qualification campaign, the theme for the evening in Leiria, Portugal was that the new cycle for the United States started on Tuesday with a 1-1 draw against the European champions.
“To get that kind of result against that kind of team is huge,” right back DeAndre Yedlin said in the immediate aftermath. “Obviously the feeling of not making the World Cup is not going to leave, but it’s something that makes it a little bit better and gives people some hope for the future.
For the first time in more than 30 years, the US took the field for a match knowing they would not be participating in the next World Cup. And on a night celebrating the restorative power of soccer in a country wounded by natural disaster, the US began baby-stepping towards a recovery from the worst defeat in team history.
The US goal-scorer and senior team debutant Weston McKennie stressed that although this game was closing out what he charitably described as “a rough year”.
“You can tell that this group is full of energy,” the 19-year-old Schalke 04 midfielder said. “We went out and fought from beginning to end. As coach said, there’s a lot of opportunities for guys right now. We just wanted to turn the page and look into the future.
“We have a bunch of new guys who came in, fresh faces that wanted to prove that could play at this level and represent the country well. I think tonight was a good starting point for that.”
Matt Miazga, who at 22 earned his fourth cap for the senior squad, also stressed the need move forward.
“A lot of young players got their debuts today and played well and added experience to their resumes,” Miazga said. “2017 was a disappointment with the World Cup, and rightfully so, but we have to look forward now. We don’t look back. We don’t dwell on the past. We have look forward, take responsibility and improve.”
Tuesday’s match, originally slated to be played at Estádio Algarve in southern Portugal, was moved to Leiria last month by the Portuguese Federation to help with recovery from the wildfires that devastated Portugal this past year, with proceeds of the gate having been earmarked for relief efforts.
For their parts, the teams could not have entered tonight’s game from more opposite sides soccer’s wheel of fate. The Seleção, Euro 2016 champions and No3 in the Fifa world rankings, came in off a brilliant World Cup qualifying campaign in which they skated through the grueling Uefa qualification and won their group, dropping only three points along the way.
The US, of course, walked out of the tunnel tonight in the wake of a shambolic qualifying campaign, punctuated by an embarrassing defeat to Trinidad & Tobago five weeks ago that left the Americans out of the World Cup for the first time since 1986.
But now the US team confront a challenge peculiar to international soccer. How do you put a devastating loss behind you when the next opportunity to truly erase the mistake is years away? As Christian Pulisic poignantly noted in the Players’ Tribune this week, the 2022 World Cup will not kick off for more than 1,800 days. After the Atlanta Falcons had their hearts ripped out in front of 111m people in Super Bowl LI, they had to wait a paltry six months before the opening whistle of the 2017 season gave them a shot at redemption.
The Americans attempted to conquer this problem by infusing the team with youth and stressing the importance of moving on – even going so far as to suggest tonight’s game was part of a “new cycle” in which they were now participating. Maybe they can invite Italy.
Of course, the notion that the on-field action of one game with an interim coach and what many hope is a lame-duck US Soccer president running the show could have a material effect on the team’s future prospects is more than a bit of stretch. But as the adage goes, you play the games on your schedule. And in front of a late-arriving crowd of 19,017 at Estádio Municipal Dr Magahlães Pessoa, although the game action always felt secondary to the arc of this US team’s story the Americans acquitted themselves well on the European holders’ home turf.
After taking a 1-0 lead on McKennie’s calm finish 21 minutes in, the US gifted Portugal an equalizer 10 minutes later when Ethan Horvath managed to allow an innocent-looking strike creep through both his arms and legs. A post on either end of the pitch and some great goalkeeping by Beto in the Portuguese net kept the game knotted at 1-1 through the second half.
This, however, was not a game about form, formations, or even really about personnel. It was about the mental state of a publicly humiliated team stepping on the pitch for the first time since culminating a slow-motion train wreck of a qualifying campaign by somehow managing to bury the train in Trinidad of all places.
Obviously, talking about “turning the page” and “looking forward” will provide little comfort to an American fan base that was just starting to get used to the idea of having a globally competitive soccer team before watching them face plant in the Trinidadian mud.
But platitudes from young players are not the point, and they can hardly be blamed for parroting their coaches. Just having those players around can change the outlook of a team. Before saying anything about turning any pages, McKennie described smiling during the national anthem “thinking in my head ‘I finally got to this point.’” It’s the kind of small moment that won’t go unnoticed by his team-mates.
Yedlin, who earned his squad-high 49th cap tonight playing the full ninety stressed not only the “bright future of US Soccer” but also the fact that the team “had a great time together” and was quick to acknowledge the role of the young players in helping the team move on from a fall to forget.
Qualifying for a future World Cup will only be step one in getting the taste of the Catastrophe at Couva out of the mouths of an ever more demanding American fan base. And to make a deep run in 2022 the US will need to rely not just on young players but veterans as well.
Perhaps Tuesday’s game provides some proof that the young players can help the team not just with their physical talent but with their attitude as well. As another debutant, Cameron Carter-Vickers, put it after the game “a lot of us are young like myself and we haven’t done anything yet in the game.” Maybe that is just the kind of blank slate the US needs as a guide to start cleaning up the mess they made this past year.


Who remembers the Sami Khedira transfer storm of 2015? Well, that’s because there wasn’t one. Khedira, criminally under-appreciated at Real Madrid, joined Juventus on a free transfer and that was that. It was a good move for Khedira, it was a cheap move for Juve, who now want to repeat the trick of nabbing a handsome German international central midfielder with extremely good hair on a free transfer … with Liverpool’s Emre Can.
“Emre! How could you?” go up the cries on Merseyside. Why anybody would want to leave a team that has won one League Cup in the last 11 years for a team that reached the Champions League final in June and has won six Scudettos on the trot is anyone’s guess. That said, reports in Italy say that Khedira has been putting on the charm offensive on Can in the international break and with Liverpool’s contract negotiations stuttering over various clauses, the Old Lady look favourites to get Can as well as Schalke’s Leon Goretzka, whose contract also expires next summer: “They are available for free at the end of the season,” chief suit Giuseppe Marotta smiled. “We are interested and we’ll make an attempt but it all depends on their will.”
The aptly-named Athletic Bilboa goalie Kepa Arrizabalaga is being linked with Real Madrid and Arsenal, according to the Spanish media. The 23-year-old is another whose contract is up at the end of the season and, after impressing this season – and making his Spain debut on Saturday against Costa Rica – the Basque club could be willing to sell in January, perhaps for less than his £20m release clause. “Of course I know of the rumours, I can see them and hear them, you know they exist but I know my situation better than that,” Arrizabalaga flirted. “They don’t make me nervous and I’m keeping calm.”
Chelsea are reportedly trying to trade in one outrageously talented Brazilian in Willian for one that is slightly worse in Lucas Moura, who admittedly once nearly scored a really, really good goal against Marseille three years ago, but has otherwise been going through the motions a little bit at PSG.
Manchester United have added Steven N’Zonzi to the list of the central midfielders they are trying to sign. The Frenchman might be wary of joining a club that already has Paul Pogba, Nemanja Matic, Ander Herrera, Marouane Fellaini, Juan Mata, Henrikh Mkhitaryan in central midfield, but then maybe the Sevilla hotshot can buy his old house in Blackburn and do the commute to Carrington from there. “ I love the Premier League, as that’s where I started to play at a high level and I had a great time there,” the 6ft3in giant is recently quoted as saying.
It says here that West Ham want Lewis Dunk to join the David Moyes Revolution in east London, but this correspondent suspects Brighton won’t be too keen on letting their vice-captain, who only signed a shiny new five-year contract in the summer, join their relegation rivals.
Internazionale are eyeing Everton flop Sandro Ramírez, and seem confident of landing the Spaniard for even less than the £5m that the Premier League club paid for him in the summer. Despite being fully fit, the 22-year-old has been left out of the last five Everton matchday squads but the Italian club are apparently still keen on a player who scored 14 La Liga goals for Málaga last season.
After their failed £92m bid for Thomas Lemar in the summer, Arsenal have cooled their interest in the Monaco star, and are instead sending their scouts on a nice, extended trip to Lyon to monitor Nabil Fekir, who anybody can see is the best player in Ligue 1 right now. The France international won’t come cheap, but might be tempted to team up with his old mucker Alexandre Lacazette on a bench somewhere in north London.


They may have traded their longships for charter flights from Copenhagen but the red-and-white bedecked army marching towards arrivals at Dublin airport on Tuesday morning suggested the Viking spirit lives on.
Across town, those Danish fans later celebrated unrestrainedly as Age Hareide’s team ended Ireland’s World Cup dream. Substituting their ancestors’ blood-curdling violence with footballing intelligence, Denmark offered the sort of strategy and subtlety Martin O’Neill’s players simply could not muster. Along the way Christian Eriksen offered a masterclass in elusive movement and precise delivery, registering a gorgeous hat-trick in the process.
The inevitably grisly post mortem is bound to involve a painful dissection of the tactics – or alarming lack of them – deployed by O’Neill and his assistant Roy Keane. Yet awful as Ireland were, perhaps this side should earn a smidgen praise for the sheer bloody-mindedness which carried them this far.
Considering a binary squad lacking even a poor man’s Eriksen on their team sheet are very much about defying all available odds, O’Neill could not have named a more emblematic captain.
Seven years on from rupturing every ligament in his right knee and being warned by surgeons that he might struggle to walk normally again, Hull City’s David Meyler strode towards the centre circle, his armband illuminated by the floodlights.
There was a time, during their days at Sunderland, when O’Neill felt Meyler’s sometimes reckless youthful tackling left him overly open to injury but the midfielder has since earned his loyalty.
A similar collective trust binds this Ireland team but ultimately the resultant togetherness, the willingness to jump through metaphorical hoops of flame proved woefully insufficient. Stopping opponents – as they demonstrated in holding Denmark to a 0-0 draw in Copenhagen on Saturday – may be their forte but here they needed goals.
Considering Ireland had only managed four in five home qualifiers, Shane Duffy’s early looping headed goal provoked a sense of ecstasy fairly swiftly undermined by nagging pessimism.
With Danish pride piqued it did not take long for fears of false dawns to be justified but as Daryl Murphy’s subsequent volley swerved fractionally off target Hareide looked pensive. Was O’Neill’s former lodger – they shared a flat during their Norwich playing days – being outsmarted by his old friend? After all Meyler had boasted that Ireland would win, claiming that “Denmark don’t have our character, heart and desire”.
It was the sort of high-risk comment that seemed as potentially self destructive as some of his old tackles, and sure enough Hareide seized the opportunity to imbue his charges with additional motivation.
Retorting, rather pointedly, that his players possess “brains” as well as heart, Denmark’s coach mused that the game is not just about “winning duels” but “skill”. Aware that an equaliser would whisk them to Russia, his side refused to panic. Inspired by Eriksen, they delighted in passing and moving their way out of trouble.
Before long, Cyrus Christie’s own-goal provided an admittedly scrappy leveller. It proved the cue for Eriksen to issue a reminder that form may be temporary but class is permanent by concluding a clever counterattack with an elegantly executed, subtly weighted, shot which went in off the underside of the bar. The Tottenham playmaker was thoroughly subdued in Copenhagen but under pressure to underline his talismanic international status, he delivered both vision and incision.
O’Neill responded by replacing Meyler with Wes Hoolahan. The manager’s critics thought he should have played Hoolahan from the start but the Norwich creator is no Eriksen and his introduction made minimal impact. In mitigation the newcomer could have done without quite so many high, punted, often impetuously snatched deliveries. O’Neill should not escape censure for his part in that particular policy.
As Ireland chased long balls and lost causes, Eriksen curved an exquisite shot beyond Darren Randolph from the edge of the area to score his side’s third before completing that treble in even more sublime fashion.
Meyler’s heart, Keane’s media addresses and the Irish fans’ craic will be missed in Russia but the world is going to enjoy watching Eriksen.


There was a certain symmetry about the weird yet wonderful careers of Graeme Hick and Mark Ramprakash. Unrelenting runscorers at domestic level, they were England’s 90s nearly men, with patchy international careers that did neither’s extravagant gifts justice. Both were in and out of the side, shunted up and down the order in the bad old days before central contracts.
They made their Test debuts together, against West Indies at Headingley in 1991, and England won. Ramprakash made a pair of 27s, which was a sign of things to come – it would end up being his Test average (although that went up to 42 against Australia). He would last a year longer in Test cricket than Hick, finishing in April 2002, but playing 13 Tests fewer, and Hick’s average at least sneaked into the 30s. At first-class level both had averages deep in the 50s, and made a very neat 250 centuries between them (Hick 136 to Ramprakash’s 114), amid 76,771 runs and look very likely to be the last two batsmen to register 100 first-class hundreds.
And so to Townsville, where the tangle continues. Ramprakash is England’s batting coach, who as a frightfully fit 48-year-old is a tireless exponent of the dog-thrower, is available for a net at all hours and would probably still rather be hitting than throwing. Those who have seen him play charity matches since retirement know that to be true. Hick, looking every bit as fit, is the enemy now. He is coaching England’s final opponents before the first Ashes Test, a Cricket Australia XI, and is Australia’s batting coach having lived in the country for six years.
Hick appeared for media duties in the rain on Tuesday. There were some gentle interrogatory throw-downs – nothing it has to be said, like the real short-pitched horrors Ramprakash was pinging at England’s batsmen – about his promising young charges, then a few familiar faces took a trip down memory lane.
“Oh, we don’t have to go back on all that do we?” Hick said with a smile when asked about his and Ramprakash’s careers. “I thought we’d gone past that. We’ve got an Ashes series to look forward to …”
Hick appeared neither surprised at the line of questioning – although it’s hard to imagine that any of the other members of the top 10 first-class century-makers of all time (Hick is No8) were often asked much about “what went wrong” – nor to carry any great regrets. There are things he wishes he knew then – “I wouldn’t have listened to the media as much as I did” – and aspects of the top level, such as the brutal level of analysis and comment , that he explains with empathy to young players, like Matt Renshaw, who looks likely to lose his opener’s spot after scoring 69 runs in six innings this Australian summer. Test disappointment – in between all the extraordinary achievements – surely made both men better coaches.
“Fortunately, yes,” said Hick when asked if his international career feels a distant memory. “I can sleep at night these days. I’ve never been one to reflect and look back and feel sorry for myself. I had great opportunities and loved what I did. I reflect on it now in terms of some of the things I did and decisions I made to try to help people in what they go through, particularly the younger players.
“Quite often during those moments I think: ‘Yes, that’s what I went through and this is what helped me.’ It doesn’t mean it necessarily helps someone else but it’s one of the challenges I’ve enjoyed in coaching. You have to understand how important your relationship with each player is and how each one is different. If you can create a good relationship and feel you can gain some leverage and pass on some knowledge. Of course they don’t have to take it.”
Does he ever pause to wonder if his and Ramprakash’s careers would have panned out differently with the stability afforded to modern players? “I don’t know,” he says. “Central contracts came in as I was going out and there’s so much cricket now it’s great to have them to control it. As I said I’m not someone who looks back and says, ‘If only.’ Why would I have regrets? It’s for me to deal with and I’ve dealt with that myself. I know I tried hard and worked hard but I don’t dwell on it. I count myself as very fortunate to have had the chances I had.”
Hick and Ramprakash are as different as their careers are similar, but Hick says he is looking forward to catching up over their “common ground”: the production of runs and, now, run-makers.


A senior Fifa official took at least $1m in bribes to vote for Qatar to host the 2022 World Cup, a witness testified in court on Tuesday, as part of a broad investigation into corruption at Fifa.
Julio Grondona, a senior vice-president at Fifa and head of the Argentinian football association until his death in 2014, allegedly told the witness, Alejandro Burzaco, an Argentinian sports marketing executive, that he was owed the money in exchange for his vote, which helped Qatar secure the lucrative tournament.
Qatar’s victory, announced in December 2010 after four rounds of knockout voting by Fifa’s 22-person executive committee in Zurich, has been plagued with allegations of bribery and misconduct. The sworn testimony, given in a New York City court on Tuesday, is some of the strongest evidence the 2022 vote was tainted.
Burzaco, the former CEO of the Argentinian sports marketing executive Torneos y Competencias, has pleaded guilty to handing out millions of dollars in bribes to senior South American football officials in exchange for broadcast rights to major regional tournaments.
His testimony on Tuesday alleges a sustained program of annual and one-off bribes, often over $1m a time, to a group of influential executives on South American football’s governing body, Conmebol, over a period of about a decade.
Burzaco testified that while he was arranging a $1m bribe payment to Grondona and another $1m bribe to another senior Fifa executive, Ricardo Teixeira, Grondona informed Burzaco he had taken a bribe for his World Cup vote. In total, the former executive said, he had arranged $15m in bribes for securing the rights to the Copa América, which at that point were held by a rival marketing company.
Burzaco said that Grondona told him in January 2011 to also pay him Teixeria’s $1m Copa América bribe, which the Brazilian “owed him” as “Grondona voted for Qatar to host the 2022 World Cup”.
The marketing executive had accompanied Grondona, Teixeira and Nicolás Leoz, then the Conmebol president, to Zurich for the vote in 2010 and had heard of their intention to back Qatar.
“It was not a private thing,” Burzaco said.
As the voting got under way, Burzaco said Grondona told him that Leoz had initially voted for Japan and then South Korea. During a break, he and Teixeira then pulled Leoz aside to “shake him up” and ask: “What the hell are you doing? Are you the one not voting for Qatar?” When the officials returned for the next vote, Leoz backed Qatar, Burzaco said.
The former marketing executive said that Grondona had not told him the total amount of money he accepted to make the Qatar vote or who the source of the bribe was. But he claimed to have witnessed an altercation between Grondona and Qatari officials at a Fifa event months later where the football executive was furious at news reports implicating him in corrupt dealings and insinuated he had been underpaid for his vote.
“Basically, Grondona told them [the Qatari officials]: you will pay me $80m or write a letter saying you never paid me,” Burzaco said.
Burzaco’s evidence portrayed the Argentinian executive as a kingmaker in Conmebol’s allegedly corrupt enterprise. The marketing executive said Grondona personally approved the bribes he and five other senior Conmebol officials were paid for regional tournament rights, often dictating the amounts – frequently seven-figure sums – and taking cuts for himself.
Burzaco would frequently travel with Grondona from Argentina to Conmebol’s headquarters in Luque in Paraguay, where “three or four Mercedes” would wait for them by the runway and take them straight from the plane, allowing them to skip customs, as “someone would take care of that”.
When Grondona arrived at the headquarters, Leoz would fly “40 or 50 Argentine flags around the building” to greet him. Teixeira, who resigned as president of Brazil’s federation amid corruption allegations in 2012, would receive the same treatment.
Burzaco’s testimony, which is expected to continue into Wednesday, also implicated the three former football executives, José Maria Marín, Manuel Burga and Juan Ángel Napout, currently on trial.
The three former officials, some of whom went on to replace Grondona, Teixeira and Leoz at the head of Conmebol, deny their role in the alleged 24-year scheme involving at least $150m in bribes.
As his testimony commenced on Tuesday morning, Burzaco was asked to point out the three defendants in the courtroom while testifying that he bribed all of them.
The witness described a series of meeting at hotels and restaurants in Buenos Aires starting in 2012 in which he helped strike deals for annual six-figure bribes for Maín, who replaced Teixeira as president of Brazil’s soccer federation; Burga, former president of Peru’s soccer federation; and Napout, ex-head of Paraguay’s soccer federation.
After one meeting where arrangements were made to wire Marín a portion of a $2m bribe, Marín “gave me a hug and showed me his gratitude”, Burzaco said. At another, Burga “told me he was happy collecting the bribes”, he said.
After being charged in 2015, following a morning raid on a hotel in Zurich, Burzaco testified that he briefly went into hiding before deciding to turn himself in and cooperate.
“I said, ‘Alejandro, you go to the United States and face justice,’” he said about the decision. “‘Accept responsibility.’”
The former marketing executive also claimed that several of the region’s best-known broadcasters that he had partnered with had paid bribes to football officials to secure rights to games. This included Fox Sports, partnered with Burzaco in the T&T sports marketing company, which owned the rights to the Copa Libertadores. Fox held a 75% share ofT&T from 2005, Burzaco said.
The court was presented with a sham contract written by T&T Sports and signed by the former Fox Pan American Sports chief operating officer James Ganley, which Burzaco said was created to pay out $3.7m in bribes to Conmebol officials to keep the rights to the tournament.
Fox Sports denied that the company had been aware of or approved bribes, saying in a statement: “Fox Sports had no operational control of the entity which Burzaco ran. The entity run by Burzaco was a subsidiary of Fox Pan American Sports, which in 2008, at the time of the contract in question, was majority owned by a private equity firm and under their operational and management control.”
The trial continues.


Gareth Southgate believes England’s hard-won goalless draws against Brazil and Germany have helped repair the bond between the team and its supporters that has frayed at times in the last 18 months.
“I think and hope that the English public have seen that these boys have given everything, they’ve played with pride and passion,” Southgate said after England defended their way to a second 0-0 in the space of five days. “I would hope there’s more of a connection, it felt like there was one there tonight between supporters and team.”
“We’re rebuilding. Brazil are close to the finished article. They’re a settled team and an outstanding team and it will take some team to stop them next summer. But we will take huge belief from what we’ve done.” Southgate was also quick to praise his defence for its work in securing a fourth clean sheet in a row against high-class Wembley opponents.
“The defensive performance tonight and the spirit collectively and some individual defensive performances were outstanding,” he said. “I’m more proud of them tonight as I think we’ve played the best team in the world, with their best team out. And we’ve come away with a really creditable result. We can look at areas to improve but again we’ve found so many positives in terms of players promoted to this level for the first time and performing well, and it’s not gong to get much tougher than it did tonight.”
Joe Gomez in particular won high praise for a composed showing against Neymar and Philippe Coutinho, the 20-year-old’s Liverpool colleague. “Joe has been given the man of the match and rightly so,” Southgate added. “His decision-making was good, and we know his athleticism is a real asset but his calmness in the face of dealing with some high-quality movement and through passes [was very good]. John Stones showed his defensive attributes. He’s looked really mature and controlled the line. He’s taken pride in his defending, which is a significant step for him. Harry [Maguire] has been a real plus.
“They’re not going to face more difficult tests than they have in their last two matches. The system has worked well. They had control of the game tonight no question, but we’ve limited them to very few clear-cut chances. It would have been an injustice but we could have even pinched the game tonight with the chances we had at the end.”


With 23 minutes gone on a room-temperature night at Wembley Neymar did something beautiful, delicate and almost entirely at odds with the rest of this game.
Taking the ball with a knot of white shirts in front of him Neymar eased into a tiny green pocket of space and produced a ludicrous pass, raising his right foot at an oblique angle to generate backspin and flicking off his little toe a perfectly floated ball between two defenders for Gabriel Jesus to wriggle in behind and almost get a shot on goal.
A bit later Neymar nutmegged Jake Livermore near the centre circle, drawing wild, squealing cheers. But then it was a very funny nutmeg, so obviously telegraphed it might have been the punchline to a rambling Ronnie Corbett armchair monologue.
As Brazil lost the ball Neymar tracked back and took possession from Marcus Rashford by his own goal line, slid past Kyle Walker with no discernible shift of feet then covered 60 yards like a drop of rain running down a window. For all the money, the baggage, the celebrity persona, this is a genuinely effortless footballer.
Not that England were at any stage beguiled, or shaken from their furiously dogged defensive shape on a night when the most expensive footballer in the world was only ever allowed to decorate rather than dominate.
But then, this is how Southgate’s England have begun to define themselves, a team of hair-shirt defensive diligence, reflecting the manager’s own restrained, meticulous, oddly chastened persona. Across the past six hours and four matches home and away, the combined score reads 2-0 to England. One of those goals was a penalty.
When the Football Association booked its November “prestige friendlies”, announced with great blaring pizzazz by the Wembley PA even as England sealed World Cup qualification, this probably wasn’t quite what they had in mind. England managed three shots on target across these two matches.
Throughout, they have played to avoid defeat first, never quite living up to the promise made so often during qualification that against better teams England would be able to break, to spring forward, to find space in behind.
The main focus of concern will be on an unprecedentedly joyless central midfield. Southgate continued with the Dier-Livermore fulcrum, a midfield duo who would undoubtedly be extremely useful moving furniture out of a van or manoeuvring a piano up a flight of stairs, but who lack a little when it comes to guile and delicacy of touch.
In front of them Ruben Loftus-Cheek was again delegated all creative midfield duties. England’s manager is focused. But he is unlikely ever to be confused with a cavalier.
On the reverse side of this, England would surely have lost had they tried to go toe-to-toe with more nimble, more fluent opponents. They needed that protection. In the opening half-hour Brazil were good, stretching England right across their own stellar front line.
England held their own, never at any stage fell prey to the Neymar show, were never tempted to sit back and admire. In the second minute Loftus-Cheek pressed up so aggressively against Neymar’s back as he wiggled and shimmied in search of space they seemed to be Charlestoning together 30 yards back towards his own goal. England gave no quarter here or against Germany. They are undoubtedly a team. Just not, perhaps, a particularly good one yet.
Having charmed for 30 minutes, producing in the process the only memories that are likely to linger of a so-so game, Neymar faded to the edge of things. For a while in the second half he fell over a bit. Then he faded again. Then he fell over a few times more, wisely taking the chance to rest on the lush turf with a full league and European programme coming up.
The frustration will be that at times England showed they do have some flair of their own. For Rashford this was a fine occasion playing opposite Neymar, on whom he has modelled parts of his game. He played well, showing his own confidence on the ball, not afraid to dribble and twist and take on his man.
It is an unhelpful comparison in many ways: Neymar is a unique player, with a way of moving the ball and shifting his balance that often eludes the naked eye, gliding about like a lovely little lightweight skill-robot made out of graphite and aluminium and icing sugar. But Rashford has his own qualities, too, and will learn from games like these.
England do have craft and flair in this group. The question remains, will they be allowed to show it?


Martin O’Neill rued the mistakes that contributed to his team’s chastening World Cup play-off defeat by Denmark but defended his record as Republic of Ireland manager.
The Irish took an early lead in Dublin thanks to Shane Duffy’s sixth-minute strike but soon disintegrated and were punished by a Danish team for whom Christian Eriksen sparkled, scoring a high-class hat-trick and prompting the Denmark manager to describe him as one of the world’s top-10 players.
“I’m really disappointed. We were well beaten in the end after a really good start,” said O’Neill, whose team surrendered their lead by conceding twice in three first-half minutes following a series of blunders. “The two goals we conceded in a couple of minutes knocked us for six. They were very, very poor goals.”
O’Neill reacted angrily to the suggestion that a defeat such as this had always been on the cards because of his negative approach and that he had finally run out of luck. “That’s simply not true,” he said. “I didn’t win the trophies I’ve won as a player and a manager by having luck. I totally disagree with that.
“We were well beaten by a side that was technically better than us and had a world-class player in their team. We fought tooth and nail to get into this position. This was not the first match of the competition, it was a play-off to get to the World Cup. The disappointment is strong but I have to commend the players for getting this far.”
Before the end of the group stage O’Neill reached a verbal agreement with John Delaney, the head of the Football Association of Ireland, about signing a new two-year contract. That has not yet been signed. “I haven’t spoken to John since we last talked about it,” he said. “I’ll speak to him again, I’m sure, in the next couple of weeks.”
Denmark’s manager, Age Hareide, said his team is benefiting from how happy Eriksen is at Tottenham Hotspur. “He’s absolutely in the top-10 [players in the world],” he said. “It’s difficult to rank but we saw against Real Madrid that he’s probably one of the best players in his positions at the moment,” he said. “Ronaldo and Messi are playing as forwards but Christian is more a wide man or a central midfielder. He has this ability of scoring goals and finding space. And he’s in a team now, Tottenham, that wants to play football. We saw that against Real Madrid. It suits him to play there. He has good players to play there and a good manager. I think he’s enjoying his time at Tottenham at the moment.”


The funny thing is that until last week it had been seven years since England’s last goalless draw at Wembley, going all the way back to a Euro 2012 qualifier against Montenegro when Fabio Capello was in charge. They have now had two in the space of four days but as Gareth Southgate pointed out, that is not necessarily such a bad thing when the opposition have been the highest-placed teams in Fifa’s world rankings.
Southgate can certainly be encouraged by clean sheets against first Germany and now a Brazil side that likes to think of itself as football royalty. England’s inexperienced line-ups have managed two creditable results against sides that will go to the World Cup with realistic aspirations of going all the way. Joe Gomez was named as the man of the match for this one and Dominic Solanke, a substitute, will certainly remember the night he won his first cap. He came on with Tammy Abraham after 75 minutes, meaning Southgate has given half a dozen players their England debuts over the last two fixtures.
Unfortunately for Solanke, his touch was heavy when he had the chance to make himself a hero in the final exchanges. “Congratulations,” the on-pitch reporter gushed to Eric Dier during an interview directly after the match – presumably, for not losing. Yet England might actually have won the game with that late chance and without going overboard, Southgate was entitled to think it had been a useful exercise, particularly bearing in mind the nature of the Seleção line-up.
This was the strongest team available to Tite, the Brazil coach, and the imbalance of talent was often a reminder why England will not be in the first pot of seeds when the World Cup draw is made on 1 December. Neymar, in particular, could be mesmerising and England were reminded why it will be so imperative to keep the ball against the best teams in Russia next summer. It is simple really: give away the ball at this level and it can be a long time before it comes back. “We couldn’t get hold of the ball and keep it,” Southgate said. “We looked anxious with the ball.”
That in itself made this a rarity: an England game at Wembley where the opposition had more of the ball, with the more refined touches and the swagger of a side who know they are something special. Brazil lacked a penetrative edge but, even with Philippe Coutinho having a below-par night, it was still a joy at times to see the way they moved the ball.
The pass Neymar nonchalantly curled into Gabriel Jesus midway through the first half, playing the ball with the outside of his boot, was just one example. Neymar does not often use his left foot but on this evidence, maybe he should try it more often. His next attempt to release Jesus was another beauty. Neymar’s shooting could be wild and the half-time announcer even had the temerity to poke fun at one of the misses, with the shot replayed on the large screens. Just a bit of fun, perhaps, but Neymar was operating at a much higher level than his opponents, as demonstrated by his exquisitely delivered nutmeg on Jake Livermore and the umpteen step-overs with which he tormented the same player later on. It is not often Wembley hosts one of the world’s category-A footballers and the fans here should have soaked it up. Neymar is a treat, and should be cherished for what he does.
England never moved the ball as quickly as their opponents, or with the same kind of fluidity, and Southgate made the point that their carelessness owed in part to fretting about Brazil’s ability. Ruben Loftus-Cheek had a fine game against Germany but his second cap ended in the 35th minute because of a minor back injury. Jesse Lingard took his place, operating just behind Marcus Rashford and Jamie Vardy, but it was a pity that England did not have Harry Kane or Dele Alli to see how the team would have done with their best attack in place.
Rashford showed in flashes why he will always back himself to trouble even the most accomplished teams, including one little pirouette and improvisational drag-back to take him away from Marcelo, Miranda and Casemiro all at once. Vardy, however, had a difficult night and if England are going to proceed with a wing-back system that formation works best when the relevant players feel able to advance. Kyle Walker and Ryan Bertrand were more occupied here with helping the team to maintain a five-man defensive line.
“I can’t remember one or two opportunities from them that scared us,” Tite said afterwards. “I don’t believe England will play at the World Cup like this.”
It says something about the expectations surrounding Tite’s team that he faced a grilling from the Brazilian journalists. The closest Brazil came to finding a winner came after Dier lost the ball in midfield and the substitute Fernandinho strode forward before skimming a low shot off the outside of a post. Otherwise, there was not a huge amount to keep Joe Hart busy on the night England’s goalkeeper won his 75th cap, John Stones excelled in defence and Ashley Young, a substitute, made his first international appearance for four years.
Brazil’s more impressive work came outside the penalty area and Jesus was substituted late on after taking a bang to a knee.


Trust in raw talent is no guarantee of victory in any sport, and it was tested to snapping point when Roger Federer survived a serious examination of his pedigree to advance to the semi-finals of the ATP World Tour Finals, while Jack Sock also stayed in the race.
Sock, full of American swagger on his first visit to the singles tournament, beat the 2014 US Open champion and this year’s Wimbledon finalist Marin Cilic 5-7, 6-2, 7-6 (4) in two hours and 37 minutes in the afternoon, while Federer, who has won six of these end-of-season titles, beat the rising Alexander Zverev 7-6 (5), 5-7, 6-1 in the evening. It took the Swiss two hours and 11 minutes, although not all of that experience was entirely serene.
Federer plays Cilic on Thursday afternoon, clearly designed to ramp up day-time ticket sales in a tournament shredded by the absence of the injured Andy Murray, Novak Djokovic, Stan Warwinka, Milos Raonic and Kei Nishikori, as well as the less-than-surprising departure of Rafael Nadal after limping to heroic defeat on one good knee against David Goffin on Monday. Sock plays Zverev in the evening TV slot.
Federer, who had not dropped a set here this week, said courtside after a rousing comeback against Zverev: “It was a good battle. I was trying to put a lot of balls in play. It was tough. I don’t think I qualified for the ATP World Finals at 20. I’m very excited for his future. He’s a great guy. I’m relieved that in the last match I can play freely against Cilic. Maybe now I can work on my game a little.”
Reflecting on his performance, he told Sky: “I’m using the slice behind the baseline normally but I got stuck, a little too passive a few times. I struggled on the offence a few times today. [But] I’m qualified again for the semis. I couldn’t be happier.”
After 24 games, Zverev, already No3 in the world – the ranking that the injured Murray held in absentia until tumbling to No16 in the world – held three set points on Federer’s serve, and the arena was on edge all around the 20,000 seats as the Swiss strained to keep the contest down to two sets and an early night.
The tension remained ramped to the limit as a wayward Federer backhand allowed the Russian-German to level at a set each. They had been playing for precisely two hours, a symmetry that would soon be ripped asunder. The finish was nowhere near as fraught as the beginning.
Federer had lost only four times in 53 matches this year: but only the Russian Evgeny Donskoy in the second round in Dubai in February, and Tommy Haas, at the first time of asking in Stuttgart in June, had beaten him from a set down.
When Zverev blew a 40-0 lead with a lazy forehand to drop serve for 1-4 in the third, the game looked pretty much up. A double fault to hand Federer victory was more than symbolic. Zverev was tired, spent and well beaten.
In an must-win match, Zverev has to defeat Sock on Thursday. It won’t be easy.
“That was a tough one, for sure,” Sock, here for the first time in singles, said after beating, the Croatian’s seventh defeat in eight matches here over the years. “It’s been an interesting morning so far,” the American said. “The fire alarm went off in our hotel at 4am.
“I love playing in London. You make me feel at home. My coach nicknamed me Showtime when I was young because I always love to play in front of people. There’s always a lot going on. I don’t even know what I’m doing some times.”


The deadline for Women’s Super League clubs to apply to stay in the top two tiers next season closed last Friday. Less than 50 days after announcing the controversial plans to restructure women’s football, clubs have had to submit details of how they will meet the new strict criteria set out by the Football Association that will see the establishment of a fully professional top tier and semi-professional second tier. The changes have brought a mixed response from clubs and now we have the first glimpse of their effects.
Last Tuesday the WSL 2 club Watford announced they would not be applying to remain in the new semi-professional league, instead choosing to drop down into the amateur Women’s Premier League. Two days later the WSL 1 side Sunderland, who reverted to semi‑professionalism this year, revealed they too would not meet Friday’s deadline, instead choosing to launch a “joint bid” (presumably with the WSL 2 side Durham or in partnership with a university) for the top flight in March alongside applications from the lower leagues.
Then last Friday Yeovil, vocal opponents of the changes who have fought their way into WSL1 on a shoestring, announced they had submitted their application to stay in the top flight following weeks of campaigning, including crowdfunding. It is not clear whether they have reached the minimum investment level required.
At the first hurdle, clubs are beginning to fall by the wayside after concerns from the outset, and voices from across women’s football, that this would be the case.
A petition against the restructure by Tony Farmer, the founder of Chelsea Ladies in 1991, who has started the group FA WSL Fans United posed 19 questions to the FA and elicited a written response from Katie Brazier head of women’s leagues and competitions. However Farmer is critical of the reply. “If you listen to the radio interviews that Katie Brazier gave, her answers are almost identical to those in her reply to my letter, even though the questions are different,” he said. “It feels like a script.
“A year ago Yeovil were WSL 2 club of the year and applauded by the FA; a year later the FA are writing criteria that could rule them out of the league they won promotion to – it’s wrong. Promotion and relegation should be decided on the pitch not changes.”
Farmer’s passion is evident. These plans have pulled him back into the politics of women’s football even though he no longer works in the game and is “just an interested spectator now”.
He contrasts Brazier’s boast of the hugely speedy development of women’s football since 2013 with the collapse of Notts County to illustrate how fragile this growth is. The effects of the switch to a winter league this season, pitting women’s matches against men’s and in less favourable weather, also hasn’t had time to be gauged. It was expected this move would hit attendances and that is proving to be the case. Clubs at the top are struggling as a result too. Arsenal attracted a crowd of 400 to their game at home to Sunderland on Sunday, compared with winless Yeovil’s 683 the previous day.
Brazier drew a funding comparison with the Netherlands in the letter, saying: “Many other national associations have chosen not to invest in developing a strong domestic league (for example Holland) and this has resulted in their players playing overseas” But Farmer described that as “bizarre”, saying: “I’m pretty sure they won Euro 2017.”
Farmer and others have also been riled by Brazier’s statement that “the FA could, in theory, have chosen to withdraw its support to the top tiers of the domestic game at that point [the end of this season when the WSL licenses expire]”.
As Farmer points out: “Women’s football in Europe has been dominated by Germany, France and Sweden, yet they don’t have fully professional leagues. If we’re lagging behind it’s for one reason, because the FA banned women’s football for 50 years.”
The concerns laid out in Farmer’s reply to Brazier’s letter are felt by many. The statements of clubs teetering on the edge of the WSL have added to these concerns.
Five clubs currently have professional set-ups – Arsenal, Chelsea, Everton, Liverpool and Manchester City – and Reading are almost there. Their fellow WSL 1 sides Bristol City and Birmingham have probably joined Yeovil in applying to continue at the top. That would leave Sunderland as the only WSL1 team to have opted against a top-tier place next season.
West Ham, Derby County, Tottenham and Brighton have welcomed the changes and have likely launched bids to leapfrog into the top flight, which will expand from 10 to 14 teams. If these clubs are willing and able to commit to full-time professional set-ups that is to be welcomed. As Brighton’s manager, Hope Powell, said, more clubs being in that position is “fantastic”.
Rumours abound that this change will finally prompt Manchester United to join the party, though suggestions of a change of heart at Old Trafford have been far from the mark in the past.
A belief in the professionalism of women’s football is what unites all who have an interest in the game. As Farmer says: “I would like to stress that I totally support women’s football being professional. There’s no reason on this planet why it shouldn’t be.” In addition, all will agree with Chelsea’s manager, Emma Hayes, who, while supportive of investment and the increasing commercialisation of women’s football, told Sky Sports: “We have to support every team including our smaller counterparts.”
But the speed with which these changes are being executed, which is leaving some clubs behind despite their efforts, has sown the biggest seeds of discontent. Forcing some clubs to promise unrealistic investment and commitments in such a short space of time won’t create a more stable pyramid.
• Manchester City pulled clear at the top of the WSL 1 table with a 4-0 win against Bristol City. A late Magdalena Eriksson own goal against Reading meant Chelsea dropped their first points of the campaign after Karen Carney and Eni Aluko turned around a one-goal deficit and looked to have secured the three points.
• Interestingly, criticism of Eni Aluko‘s form and consistency as a result of the Mark Sampson debacle has again proved wide of the mark. With two starts and six substitute appearances this season, the super-sub has scored five goals in all competitions, making her Chelsea’s joint top-scorer alongside Fran Kirby.
• Glasgow City secured an 11th straight Scottish Women’s Premier League title with a 3-0 win over their nearest rivals, Hibernian. Lauren McMurchie opened the scoring in the 16th minute and Hibs were punished for defensive indecisiveness as goals from Abbi Grant and Hayley Lauder wrapped up the game before the half-hour.
• The extremely popular former Arsenal manager Laura Harvey has left the top job at Seattle Reign to fuel talk linking her with the England manager vacancy. The 37-year-old has two NWSL titles from her five years in the US and has also been linked to the US women’s national team.


Sergio Agüero was taken to a hospital for checks after he fainted during half-time of Argentina’s 4-2 friendly defeat to Nigeria.
The Argentine Football Association said on its Twitter account that the Manchester City forward “had a blackout and was taken [to hospital] so routine examinations were made only as a precaution”.
The AFA gave no further details on the incident, which occurred after Agüero had scored in the first half. Media later published pictures of Agüero walking out of the stadium.
Manchester City said the 29-year-old Agüero had been cleared by doctors to return to England as planned after he suffered what they called “a dizzy spell”.
“Sergio never lost consciousness, and was taken to hospital for precautionary medical checks,” City said on their official website
In the match, an Argentina side without Lionel Messi squandered a two-goal lead and slipped to a shock defeat.
Ever Banega and Agüero gave Argentina the lead, with Kelechi Iheanacho pulling a goal back for Nigeria just before half-time with a free-kick.
The Arsenal forward Alex Iwobi scored twice and Brian Idowu also found the net for Nigeria in the second half.
The Argentina defender Javier Mascherano said: “Playing against a team of such physical strength you pay the price. They walked all over us … and when we tried to get back on the match we couldn’t.”
Argentina only secured their spot at the World Cup in the last round of South American qualifiers and have not delivered convincing performances without Messi.
The substitute Lars Stindl scored an equaliser deep in stoppage-time to earn the World Cup holders Germany a 2-2 draw against France in Cologne.
The Arsenal forward Alexandre Lacazette had given Les Bleus the lead in the 33rd minute after being set up by Manchester United’s winger Anthony Martial.
Timo Werner drew Germany level early in the second half from a fine pass by Mesut Özil, only for Lacazette to restore France’s lead in the 71st minute.
Die Mannschaft became only the second European team to win all 10 of their World Cup qualifying matches en route to securing a place, but looked on course for a home defeat. However, with three minutes of added time played, Borussia Monchengladbach striker Stindl calmly converted a flick on from Mario Gotze.
Romelu Lukaku became Belgium’s leading scorer at the age of 24 when his goal gave them a 1-0 win over fellow World Cup qualifiers Japan in a friendly in Bruges on Tuesday.
Lukaku scored with the easiest of headers at the far post from Nacer Chadli’s cross to take his tally to 31 goals in 65 appearances.
Sergio Ramos scored twice from the penalty spot as Spain drew 3-3 with Russia in a friendly on Tuesday.
Grit and some fine individual skill from striker Fyodor Smolov brought Russia back from 2-0 down to earn a draw which will boost morale after a tough year for the 2018 World Cup hosts.
“It was a very tense match and at a certain point we relaxed and lost control of the ball,” Spain coach Julen Loptegui said. “The Russian team got better in the course of the game and things started working out for them.”


Sometimes that hoped-for breath of fresh air is just halitosis, but try telling Weston McKennie this was a meaningless and pointless first step on the road to 2022.
The midfielder scored on his US senior debut on Tuesday, providing a low-wattage moment of brightness for a program still enveloped in gloom.
The 19-year-old Texan spent part of his youth in Germany and starts for Schalke in the Bundesliga. Born in the Dallas suburb of Little Elm, he developed in the FC Dallas youth system and is friends with Christian Pulisic, of Borussia Dortmund, who was the stand-out American in the Concacaf qualifying campaign.
McKennie dribbled into the area in the 21st minute, feinted to fool Ricardo Ferreira then slid in a low shot to the near post that sent Beto sprawling in the wrong direction. He also hit the crossbar with a second-half header.
Debut goal for Weston McKennie! 🔥🇺🇸 https://t.co/JiUklslDif
His performance offered the hint of a promising future, which was as much as this friendly with Portugal in Leiria could ever deliver, coming so soon after the Americans’ head-scratching, face-palming inability to reach next summer’s World Cup finals.
So the night will have enduring positive personal significance for McKennie, even if, more broadly, it will be nothing more than a footnote once a new manager is appointed next year and the reinvention process begins in earnest.
For now, the important action is off the field as US Soccer presidential candidates jostle ahead of February’s election in the hope of unseating the incumbent, Sunil Gulati. He has failed to resign and may seek a fourth four-year term despite appointing Jurgen Klinsmann and Bruce Arena, the two coaches who oversaw a qualifying campaign that lacked the actual qualifying.
This was always going to be an occasion pungent with the stench of of what-iffery. However long it takes to get over an entirely avoidable failure to reach a World Cup, 35 days is surely not enough. The presence of Arena on the Fox Sports 1 broadcast team only added to the lingering sense of regret at the US missing out on the World Cup for the first time since 1986.
That a star-shorn side comprised of young pretenders, solid but unexceptional veterans and out-of-fashion names plucked from the reject bin could impress for long periods away to the reigning European champions served to make the US’s absence in Russia seem even more baffling. That said, this was an exhibition against an under-strength, semi-interested Portugal and much of the US’s success stemmed from their greater energy and appetite.
The last time these nations met was a 2-2 draw in the 2014 World Cup, an outcome that helped Klinsmann’s side advance to the knock-out rounds at Portugal’s expense and breed a mood of optimism about the team’s long-term prospects that proved illusory.
Interim head coach Dave Sarachan picked eight starters aged 24 and under – compared with four in the starting XI that lost 2-1 to Trinidad & Tobago last month, when a draw would have been enough to reach Russia.
He also handed a first cap to 18-year-old midfielder Tyler Adams and gave forward CJ Sapong his first appearance since January 2012 – reward for a 16-goal season with the Philadelphia Union. The most experienced US international on show, DeAndre Yedlin, was the only starting survivor from the T&T debacle, winning his 49th cap.
Sapong was effective in a first half that the US controlled until the equalizer. There was no Cristiano Ronaldo for Portugal – who did qualify for the finals – and Tuesday’s most recognizable veteran, Pepe limped off after nine minutes.
Sapong crossed for Adams in the 20th minute but his weak shot made for an easy save by Beto. Seconds later, McKennie’s composed finish gave the visitors a lead that did not last.
With Tim Howard’s long tenure surely concluded, goalkeeper is a questionable position for the US. In his second appearance, 22-year-old Club Brugge goalkeeper Ethan Horvath did his candidacy no favors, conceding a grim equalizer in the 31st minute.
Vitorino Antunes lashed a bouncing ball into the box from the left wing but Horvath dived over it. The gloves that failed to capture the ball covered his face, hiding what one assumes was a look of horror and embarrassment.
Horvath probably wants this one back. 🙈 https://t.co/kITOGZ9qhD
At the break, Sarachan replaced Horvath with Bill Hamid and Cameron Carter-Vickers, the Essex-born defender on loan at Sheffield United from Tottenham Hotspur, won his first cap.
Adams might have joined McKennie in the debut goal club but his 52nd-minute header from six yards out was superbly saved by Beto, though the goalkeeper ought to have been given no chance.
McKennie then headed off the bar and another England-born player, striker Dom Dwyer, arrived as a late substitute.
Inside the last 20 minutes, Carter-Vickers almost scored from point-blank range but a leaping Beto denied him with his feet as the two vied for a loose ball.
The contest petered out and ended 1-1 – a forgettable result on a night with bittersweet undertones. Perhaps 2018 would have been too soon for the likes of McKennie, Adams and Carter-Vickers, but 2022 seems excessively far away.


England’s odd couple will be reunited this week if, as expected, the fit-again Jonny May is involved against Australia on Saturday. The wing and his new Leicester team-mate George Ford have developed an excellent understanding on the pitch but, according to the latter, it will be some time before the “high maintenance” May is invited to stay at his house again.
To assist May following his summer arrival from Gloucester, Ford offered him temporary lodgings only to discover the pair were less than compatible domestically. “He’s such a nice guy but I had to kick him out after three weeks,” said Ford. “We couldn’t do any more otherwise our friendship would have deteriorated. He used to come home, go straight into the lounge, get the TV remote and lie on the sofa as if it was his. That would annoy me straightaway. He’d just treat it like it was his house, which I don’t mind because he’s a mate, but sometimes he would just take it a step too far.”
It did not help when, on a subsequent visit, May spilt takeaway sauce over Ford’s girlfriend’s new light-blue suede rug and then revealed in an interview his tidy-minded host had “probably three or four different types of Hoover and has them on all the time”. Ford is now over his rug horror – “he bought me a new one, to be fair” – but does not yet regard May as a reformed character.
“I think it took the lads at Leicester a while to work him out because he can come across as quite strange at first. Now they have a good understanding of him because half the time he’s playing up rather than being normal. Everyone likes to spend time with Jonny but little and often is best. If you spend all day with him at training you just want to relax and chill out when you come home but he’s just non-stop. He’s very good at manipulating situations and knowing how to wind people up.”
According to Ford, however, May is not so hot on his east Midlands’ geography. “For the first couple of weeks he didn’t know his way round so I picked him up and took him to training. One day he had to find his own way there so he typed Welford Road into his satnav. He thought it was just a stadium; little did he know it’s 12 miles long. He ended up on the other side of Leicester, late for the team run and the meeting. He then announced ‘That’s the last time I drive to training on my own’, so I have to pick him up every time now.”
At least the 27-year-old knows the best way to the try line, having scored 10 tries in his first nine games for Leicester. A tweaked hamstring ruled him out of contention for the Argentina game but Eddie Jones has indicated he is under strong consideration for the matchday squad against Australia and confidence is not an issue.
“He told me last week he broke another record in terms of his speed,” said Ford. “That’s one thing he’s good at – telling everyone he’s breaking records. I don’t think he knows what he’s doing half the time, but he’s an athlete and knows where the try line is. You can’t take too much of that away from him because it makes him the player he is. It’s not by chance he’s been scoring tries nearly every week; he’s in the right place at the right time and he works incredibly hard on being professional and getting quicker.”
Finally there is one area in which he and the 24-year-old Ford – “I like to think I’m Jonny’s counsellor and carer” – appear to share something vaguely in common. The England coach rates his fly-half’s sharp tactical brain so highly he entrusted him with the captaincy last Saturday after Dylan Hartley was substituted and has so far resisted any temptation to install Owen Farrell at 10 instead.
Ford was certainly a central figure in Farrell’s absence in Argentina in the summer and while remaining a rugby nut, has also started to appreciate the value of switching off away from rugby. “On the field you’ve got to be quite demanding of others and lead in different ways; I’ve got make sure that when I go home after training, I try to switch off from rugby more and chill out, be a bit more relaxed.”
This week, though, is primarily about the day job, with England in need of an improved display against the Wallabies. “We’re not going to reinvent the wheel, we just need to be better at what we do. When we do have the ball this weekend we’ll certainly be looking to look after it a bit better.”
He makes it sound less daunting than looking after May on a daily basis.


There were less than three minutes on the clock when the Wales supporters started their campaign to keep Chris Coleman on as manager and it quickly became clear that it was going to be the soundtrack of the evening.
“Chrissy Coleman, we want you to stay” was the message that reverberated from the fans time and again on the manager’s 49th – and potentially last – match in charge of his country.
With the stadium only around half full, it was a slightly strange occasion in many respects and finished with Coleman briefly acknowledging the Wales supporters at the final whistle, shortly after Panama had snatched an injury-time equaliser, turning on his heel and heading down the tunnel with no one quite sure whether the 47-year-old will be back in the dugout here again.
Coleman confirmed afterwards that talks will continue with the Football Association of Wales over the coming days, but also admitted that he has no idea what the future holds.
His contract expires at the end of the month and the feeling is that the two parties are not a million miles apart in their attempts to reach an agreement, yet nothing can be said with any certainty about his position right now.
Asked whether he felt emotional during the game, Coleman reflected on the difficult times at the start of his tenure and said: “It’s a funny one because I don’t know what’s going to happen. But a huge, huge thank you.
“These are our core fans. These are the fans that in the first 12 to 18 months, they didn’t like me much. But I didn’t mind because they were the only fans that showed up for us – 9,000-10,000 people. I didn’t mind them booing because at least they paid the money to come and support their country and they’re still doing it.
“So a huge thank you to them. It was nice they were singing my name and I appreciate that. I hope that’s not going to be the last game. I don’t know, if I’m honest with you. I think I am the man to lead them.
“But there’s a bit more to it than that.”
A night that started with Coleman providing the Wales supporters with a glimpse into the future by giving full debuts to Chelsea’s Ethan Ampadu, Liverpool’s Ben Woodburn and Sheffield United’s David Brooks, ended with the manager thanking his players in the dressing room for their part in a remarkable journey that peaked with the performances at the European Championship finals last year.
“I said to them, if this is my last experience with them, they have been a pleasure,” Coleman said.
“We have been through a lot, incredible experiences, bonds and friendships that will never be broken.
“It’s all down to the players, an incredible bunch and they’ll keep achieving because they are all at a good age. I think there’s still a little hangover because we’re not going to Russia, that will burn for a while that, we’re all still hurting over that, but that will subside.”
It was an evening that also featured a little bit of history as Chris Gunter, wearing the captain’s armband for the first time, made his 85th appearance for Wales to draw level with the late Gary Speed as the country’s most-capped outfield player. Gunter is still looking for his first goal for Wales and said beforehand that he would not take a penalty if it was given because he feared that it would turn an international friendly into a farce.
As it happens, he probably should have stepped forward instead of Sam Vokes, whose poor first-half spot-kick was easily saved.
Panama, who have succeeded where Wales failed by qualifying for the World Cup finals, eventually fell behind in the 75th minute, when the lively Tom Lawrence cut inside from the left, leaving a clutch of defenders in his wake, and drilled a fine shot into the far corner of the net. Yet the visitors had clearly not read the script and levelled late on when Armando Cooper slipped a close-range shot beyond Danny Ward.
Whether that proves to be the final goal of the Coleman era remains to be seen.


And lo, the spirit and awkwardness of Martin O’Neill’s Republic of Ireland were not enough. Those qualities took them to within touching distance of their first World Cup in 16 years, but no further. Denmark, far superior in this play-off, will go instead. In Christian Eriksen they have a player who belongs among the elite, a point he expressed beautifully in Dublin with an exquisite hat-trick.
Fleetingly Ireland had Russia within their reach, as Shane Duffy headed them into an early lead. But by half-time the Danes had wrenched the World Cup ticket off the home side and they never gave it back. Age Hareide’s side scored the away goal the Irish had dreaded when Andreas Christensen’s ugly shot found the net via a post and Cyrus Christie’s leg in the 29th minute. Then came Eriksen’s trio of beauties. It seemed like an unnecessary insult when Nicklas Bendtner added another from a late penalty.
And yet this could have been worse for Ireland. When challenged to be more enterprising they became more ragged. Perhaps lack of attacking practice had made them rusty. Several of Denmark’s goals had their origins in Irish blunders. But Darren Randolph made several good saves to prevent a heavier toll. The Danes were a match for Ireland physically and a class above them in terms of skill, fluency and ambition.
While Eriksen sparkled, the closest player that Ireland have to someone of that calibre, Wes Hoolahan, began on the bench again. O’Neill made only one alteration to the line-up that had shut out the Danes in Copenhagen on Saturday, with David Meyler replacing Callum O’Dowda. If Ireland were to attack more adroitly than they did on Saturday, then that change would have to come from the same personnel, with loud verbal cues from a rambunctious crowd.
It took six minutes for that crowd’s wish to be granted. The goal owed nothing to new-found intricacy but no one cared about aesthetics when Nicolai Jorgensen’s attempt to clear a long free-kick by Robbie Brady resulted in the striker looping the ball backwards in his own box, inviting Duffy to soar high and nod the ball past the advancing Kasper Schmeichel and into the net from eight yards.
Duffy had scored a similar goal in Georgia in the group stages, after which Ireland had become so passive they almost enticed the opponents to equalise, which Georgia eventually did. There would be serious jeopardy in doing the same here. But soon, whether by Ireland’s choice or the duress applied by Denmark, the home side began backpedaling.
They were fortunate in the 10th minute that Jens Stryger Larsen failed to connect properly with the ball after Simon Kjaer caught the Irish defence out with a long diagonal pass. Then they were grateful to Randolph for diving to his left and tipping away a drive from 20 yards by William Kvist. Two minutes later the goalkeeper came to the rescue again, parrying a blast by Pione Sisto.
In an increasingly frenetic game it was not one-way traffic. Daryl Murphy almost doubled Ireland’s lead with a dainty flick at the near post from a cross by Christie, his shot missing the target by inches. Moments later James McClean stormed down the left and into the box before firing a yard past the far post.
Despite those raids, it was not looking like Ireland would last 90 minutes without conceding. As it turned out, they did not even get past 29. There was ingenuity and cruelty in the way they were infiltrated. After a short corner Sisto nutmegged Harry Arter and skittered into the box before sending a low cross to Christensen. The defender scuffed his shot but it hit a post and rebounded in off Christie. As an away goal, the equaliser put Denmark in front.
Three minutes later the visiting side took a conventional lead, Eriksen sweeping the ball regally into the net from 20 yards via the underside of the crossbar following a move that began when Stephen Ward was dispossessed on the left.
By half-time Ireland knew that to resurrect their World Cup dream they would have to score two goals in 45 minutes and avoid conceding again. Mission impossible.
Now O’Neill adopted a resolutely attacking stance, introducing Hoolahan and Aiden McGeady for Meyler and Arter at half-time. That left a void in midfield and Denmark revelled in it. After a couple more saves by Randolph, the goalkeeper was rendered helpless in the 63rd minute by the sheer brilliance of Eriksen, who crowned a fine collective move by curling a shot into the bottom corner from 20 yards.
The Tottenham Hotspur player helped himself to a third goal by punishing another mistake by Ward and ramming the ball into the roof of the net 10 minutes later. Bendtner then scored from the spot after a clumsy tangle with Duffy.


Some of the world’s largest broadcasters, including Fox Sports, were involved in bribe payments to Fifa officials in order to secure the broadcast rights to major South American football tournaments, a key witness in the investigation into corruption at football’s governing body has told a federal court in New York City.
Alejandro Burzaco, the former CEO of Torneos y Competencias, a major sports marketing company based in Argentina, testified that five other companies he had partnered with, including Brazilian network Globo and the Mexican network Grupo Televisa, had bribed Fifa officials during his tenure.
Burzaco gave evidence on the second day of the trial of three former South American football administrators, charged with accepting millions of dollars in bribes. The hearing is part of a sprawling federal investigation into endemic corruption at Fifa resulting in more than 40 criminal charges filed against football and marketing executives implicated in the global conspiracy.
Burzaco has already pleaded guilty to racketeering, wire fraud and money laundering conspiracies after he was indicted in 2015, and has since been assisting US authorities. He is one of 23 people to have pleaded guilty already.
The court heard how Burzaco had paid regular bribes, often six-figure sums, primarily to six senior officials of the South American football governing body, Conmebol, in exchange for the broadcast rights to the Copa Libertadores, South America’s premier international club competition.
Prosecutors homed in on the activities of T&T, a sports marketing company that has, since 2002, been jointly owned by Torneos y Competencias and Fox Pan American Sports and held the rights to the tournament.
The court was presented with a series of contracts between Conmebol and T&T, relating to the extension of broadcast rights for the tournament in 2008. Burzaco told the court he had paid senior officials, including the Argentinian football executive and former senior Fifa vice-president Julio Grondona and the former Conmebol president Nicolás Leoz, a range of “special bribes” ranging between $500,000 to $1m to secure the extension. The money was in addition to annual bribes, between $300,000 to $1.3m, that the six senior Conmebol officials were already receiving from T&T for the rights to the tournament.
T&T, Burzaco said, had created a sham company to pay out the one-off cash sums. The court saw a contract between T&T and an entity named Somerton for $3.7m.
“It’s not a real contract, sir,” Burzaco conceded as he told the court all the money had gone to pay off the officials. Burzaco noted one of the contract’s signatories was the former Fox Pan American Sports chief operating officer James Ganley. Burzaco had earlier told the court that Fox had become the majority owner of T&T in 2005.
On Tuesday evening, Fox responded to the allegations in court. “Any suggestion that Fox Sports knew of or approved of any bribes is emphatically false,” read a statement. “Fox Sports had no operational control of the entity which Burzaco ran. The entity run by Burzaco was a subsidiary of Fox Pan American Sports, which in 2008, at the time of the contract in question, was majority owned by a private equity firm and under their operational and management control.”
Earlier in the day, Burzaco had also said he had paid bribes to the three former football executives on trial.
José María Marín, the 85-year-old former head of Brazil’s football federation, Juan Ángel Napout, the 59-year-old Paraguayan who was president of Conmebol, and Manuel Burga, the 60-year-old former president of the Peruvian football federation, have denied multiple counts of racketeering, wire fraud and money laundering.


They have battled three times for Olympic gold, racing across the ice as part of women’s hockey’s most heated rivalry.
On Monday, the former rivals – who have captained national hockey teams for Canada and the US – announced the birth of their daughter.
Liv Chu-Ouellette, seven pounds and three ounces, was born earlier this month to parents Caroline Ouellette, the captain of Canada’s team at the 2014 Winter Games in Sochi and, Julie Chu, who led the American team from 2011 to 2013.
“I feel truly blessed to experience this incredible adventure with my love and best friend Julie,” Ouellette wrote on Instagram. “Cheers to the sleepless nights to come!”
On November 5th, at 10:18pm, after 40 weeks and 2 days, Julie and I welcomed to the world our beautiful daughter Liv. I feel truly blessed to experience this incredible adventure with my love and best friend Julie. I did not realise it was possible to love this much until I met this little buddle of joy! It was a happy pregnancy for us. Liv was on the ice to win the Clarkson Cup with Les Canadiennes de Montréal this past March. We spent the summer coaching the sport we love with great friends. Thanks to our families and friends for your support and for being part of this new journey. Cheers to the sleepless nights to come! Le 5 novembre dernier, à 22:18, après 40 semaines et 2 jours, Julie et moi avons accueilli notre magnifique fille Liv. Je suis tellement choyée de vivre ce moment incroyable avec l’amour de ma vie et ma meilleure amie Julie. Je ne croyais pas qu’il était possible d’aimer autant avant de la rencontrer! Ce fut une grossesse heureuse pour nous. Liv était sur la glace pour remporter la Coupe Clarkson avec Les Canadiennes de Montréal en Mars dernier. Notre été fut passé à enseigner le sport qu’on aime avec nos meilleures amies. Merci à tous nos familles et amis pour votre support et de faire partie de cette aventure. Cheers aux nuits blanches à venir!

The couple – who last season were team-mates on Les Canadiennes de Montréal in the Canadian Women’s Hockey League – first battled for Olympic gold in 2002, stepping on to the ice in the same jersey number: 13.
The Canadians won gold in those games. Chu and Ouellette again faced off for Olympic gold in 2010 and 2014, with the Canadians winning both times.
The decades-long rivalry continued between Olympic games, with Chu and Ouellette playing against each other for more than half a dozen world championship titles. In the 2007-2008 season, the pair worked together as assistant coaches for the University of Minnesota Duluth women’s hockey team.
On Monday, Ouellette and Chu – who between them have eight Olympic medals – described their daughter as their most incredible blessing to date. “We have already been blessed with so many things in our life: Amazing friends and family, Love, Representing our countries, and doing things we are passionate about each day,” Chu wrote on Instagram.
Their posts sparked an outpouring of reaction online. “What Julie Chu and Caroline Ouellette have proved is that you too can live the life of an inspirational sports movie with a compelling relationship arc,” wrote one person on Twitter. Another remarked: “I can’t believe Julie Chu and Caroline Ouellette just ended the USA-Canada rivalry forever.”
The former captain of the Canadian WNT just had a baby with the former captain of the USWNT. How do you expect me to be okay right now? 😭


South Africa remains the strong favourite to be awarded the 2023 Rugby World Cup on Wednesday but there is growing concern that a failure to fully engage in behind-the-scenes lobbying may have opened the door for Ireland or France.
After two weeks of rancour and recrimination from the Irish and French following World Rugby’s evaluation report and subsequent recommendation in favour of South Africa, the council of the sport’s governing body will make its decision in a secret ballot in London – 39 votes are cast, a simple majority of 20 is required for victory.
World Rugby is anxious that its council members endorse its recommendation – designed to eliminate the kind of horse-trading that has been rife in the past – but rather than admitting defeat, France and Ireland both stepped on to the offensive, leading to claim and counter-claim over the accuracy of the 139-page report.
South Africa’s best chance of victory is to reach the required 20 votes in the first round. If it does not obtain the necessary majority, however, and is pitted in a two-horse race with Ireland, there are growing fears of defeat. Insiders believe that the South Africa Rugby Union chief executive, Jurie Roux, was wrong to urge France and Ireland to withdraw from the race following World Rugby’s recommendation. Their concern is that Roux was perceived as arrogant and gave France and Ireland carte blanche to go on to the attack.
The chief executive of the Ireland union, Phillip Browne, went as far as to write a letter to World Rugby outlining his grievances.
On Friday it was greeted with a terse response from World Rugby, who consider the matter closed, but one insider has predicted Ireland will gain at least 19 votes in a two-horse race with South Africa due to extensive lobbying with those such as the USA and Germany – both of whom are looking to join the Pro14, which has its headquarters in Dublin.
It is understood Roux has recently been canvassing for South American support but there are fears that he has not done enough lobbying, instead placing too much faith in a perceived obligation among council members to follow the recommendation.
England’s reported decision to back Ireland is not surprising after Theresa May gave her official backing in September but it will only worsen South Africa’s fears. The RFU maintains that it was always going to carry out its own due diligence after England staged the World Cup in 2015, but if its three votes do go to Ireland, it can hardly be seen as an endorsement of World Rugby’s recommendation considering the governing body’s chairman, Bill Beaumont, is a former England captain and RFU chairman.
It is the first time that World Rugby has commissioned and made public a report such as this and there is therefore no precedent as to whether council members rubber-stamp South Africa as 2023 host, or vote according to other criteria. It will be of great embarrassment to World Rugby should Ireland or France prevail, however, considering this process was adopted in the interests of transparency.
France has thrown caution to the wind in its attempts to invalidate World Rugby’s report, described by its federation’s president, Bernard Laporte, as “nonsense”. Laporte has been leading the last-minute charm offensive in recent days and France’s greatest hope is its financial strength. The bid leader, Claude Atcher, promised in September that a France victory would prevent “the death of world rugby” with its financial muscle, and pledged to stop the player drain from the southern hemisphere to the Top 14. Both New Zealand and Australia, however, are expected to back South Africa.


Alan Potts, whose red, green and yellow colours have been among the most familiar in National Hunt racing over the past dozen seasons, died on Tuesday at the age of 80, three months after the death of his wife, Ann, with whom he co-owned Sizing John, the winner of the Gold Cup at Cheltenham in March.
Potts, an engineer who grew up in Yorkshire, refined a key process in the mining industry known as sizing and made a fortune after setting up his own company, MMD, 40 years ago, selling machinery to carry out the procedure to mine operators around the world.
Along with his late wife, Potts started to invest heavily in National Hunt racing in 2005, with many of his early recruits bearing names such as Sizing Europe and Sizing Australia to reflect the owners’ business interests.
Until the 2016-17 season, Potts’s runners were trained almost exclusively in Ireland by Henry de Bromhead, who saddled Sizing Europe to win eight Grade One events including the Irish Champion Hurdle in 2008, the Arkle Trophy at the Cheltenham Festival in 2010 and the Queen Mother Champion Chase at the same meeting 12 months later. Sizing Australia also recorded a Cheltenham Festival success for Potts and De Bromhead, in the Glenfarclas Cross-Country Handicap Chase in 2011.
In August 2016, however, the Potts string left De Bromhead’s stable, with Sizing John moving to Jessica Harrington’s yard and more than a dozen horses moving across the Irish Sea to join Colin Tizzard. The Potts colours enjoyed a series of big-race wins at the spring festival meetings in 2017, as Sizing John completed a unique treble with victories in the Gold Cups at Leopardstown, Cheltenham and Punchestown, while Finian’s Oscar and Fox Norton took Grade One events for the Tizzard stable at the Grand National meeting in April.
Potts had increased the size of his string at the Tizzard yard ahead of the new jumps season, and recently hired Bryan Cooper, formerly the No1 rider to Michael O’Leary’s Gigginstown Stud operation, to ride his horses in Britain. Robbie Power, who steered Sizing John to victory at Cheltenham in March, was Potts’s retained jockey in Ireland.
“It’s come as a massive shock to us, it’s horribly sad news,” Joe Tizzard, Colin’s son and assistant, said on Tuesday. “We’d got to know Alan and his family very well in the last 12 months and we had some very special times, especially at Aintree and Punchestown last year. All our thoughts are with his family.”
The Potts’s daughter, Julie, regularly accompanied her parents to the races. It is unclear at present whether her late father’s horses will continue to run as planned over the coming days and weeks, though one report on Tuesday suggested that all of the owner’s horses are expected to remain in training.
Several runners were expected to represent Potts at Cheltenham this weekend, including Finian’s Oscar, who made a successful chasing debut at Chepstow last month and holds entries in novice chase events on Friday and Sunday, and Fox Norton, who is entered in the Grade Two Shloer Chase on Sunday. Sizing John, whose success at Cheltenham in March realised a lifelong ambition for Potts, had also been expected to return to action in the near future, in the Grade One Betfair Chase at Haydock on Saturday week.

Joe Root’s instructions were curt but commanding as England gave their clearest indication yet of their Ashes XI and their captain urged Australia to “bring it on” with the first Test looming.
Root learned plenty from his first tour of Australia, when he was a blue-eyed freshman aged 22, averaged 27 and was removed from the line of fire by the time of the final Test in Sydney. He believes England were underprepared for the antagonistic atmosphere that awaited them and that he “wasn’t ready”. The result was England being “caught out”, then whitewashed. Between times, “everything seemed to happen quite quickly” and he soon discovered that Ashes tours do a remarkable line in unravelling.
The captain wants his team to be wiser, brighter, and more in control. They have not complained about the quality of opposition they have warmed up against (largely promising young players) or the pitches they have warmed up on (very sluggish), neither of which resemble what awaits at the Gabba next week. Root again shrugged off questions about the three spots – opening bat, No6, and wicketkeeper – Australia have as yet failed to fill in their own side. England’s buildup has been inward-looking and low-key by necessity.
Now Steven Finn is back home and Ben Stokes remains absent, only six of England’s squad were here in 2013-14, so Root is seeking to explain to his squad how playing in Australia feels. “It’s almost against all the odds, isn’t it? You’re in their backyard – everyone in the ground seems to think that they’re playing for Australia, and they’ll do everything they can to help their side,” he says in neat summation. “You’ve got the opportunity to upset that, go and do something really special. That’s the way I want to approach it.
“I think conversations about last time can be healthy, if they’re done in the right way,” he adds, aware that his captaincy, demeanour and batting will set the tone, but that he will also be targeted.
“One thing for me [this time] will be making sure the game is played at my pace,” he says. “Trying to be nice and calm and collected out in the middle – and feel really ready for that aspect of Test cricket, which you do experience here in Australia.
“I’ve heard a lot of chat about targeting me in particular. From our point of view, we’ll be targeting every one of them – we won’t be singling anyone out.
“I think it’s [targeting the captain] something they use as a tool sometimes, to try to get the crowd and the public behind it, to try to get on my back verbally. If they’re wasting energy trying harder at me, then I hope that works well for the rest of the guys.”
Australia’s Pat Cummins spoke on Tuesday about wishing to emulate Mitchell Johnson, England’s destroyer last time. “It would be a role I would love to play,” said the New South Wales quick, who is yet to play a Test at home. “As a fast bowler it’s [about] getting in their face and being relentless in everything we do.”
But Root believes England have smartened up enough to counter this, and just wants to get going. “There’s been a lot of talk,” he says. “Some of it exciting and some of it a load of rubbish. Especially from some of the Aussie players.
“Last time that [aggression] caught us out, and I think we are a bit wiser this time. It’s making sure we are absolutely prepared for any scenario out there, and absolutely ready for that first game, whatever they throw at us. We expect it to be hostile, we expect it to be a very loud and rowdy atmosphere at the Gabba.”
England appear to have settled on their side. Craig Overton’s selection for the third successive tour match should see him play the first Test, for England have given themselves little choice and will dearly hope their fast-bowling injury epidemic is easing.
Jake Ball is due to begin running again on Wednesday, but he will surely not have seen enough bowling to appear in Brisbane. England could have tried Tom Curran (or even the recent arrival, George Garton) here, but have opted not to because Overton and Chris Woakes want more miles in their legs before the first Test.
“Craig’s been brilliant,” Root adds. “He’s come in on this tour, thrown himself into every game and every opportunity whenever he has got the ball. He’s stood up and put his hand up to be selected, and that’s what you want. All the guys who haven’t played before have shown a lot of promise, and gone about things the right way in practice and in the games too.”
Jimmy Anderson is missing the final warm-up game with a bug, but Stuart Broad is back and, anticipating another slow surface, England decided to ease Moeen Ali and his recovered side into action by pairing him with Mason Crane. Moeen comes in beneath a settling top-six that is being given every chance to succeed. It is time they repaid England’s faith with centuries, and by parking their worrisome tendency to collapse


The encouraging news is mounting for Andy Murraybefore his return to the Tour in Australia in the new year. His travelling coach, Jamie Delgado, sounded as confident as Roger Federer had earlier in the week about the Scot’s chances of coming back competitively from a hip injury that at one point seemed bad enough to end his career.
“He played the exhibition last week in Scotland with Federer, that was good,” Delgado told Sky Sports. “That was the first time [since losing to Sam Querrey in the semi-finals at Wimbledon four months ago] that he had played against anyone at that level.
“His body recovered well after that. Then a few days later we came down here to practise with [Dominic] Thiem. That was a progression as well. He enjoyed it.
“It was great to be back here and see all the guys again and also to give him the feel of coming to a tennis event. He hasn’t been to one for a few months. [He is] missing that a lot. He will need that, practising with those guys over the next couple of months to get him ready for next year.”
All the signs are positive for his return, Delgado added.
“The plan is to start in Brisbane in the first week of the year and then there is a week’s gap between that and the Australian Open. We are in the process now of getting ready for a few weeks and try to get a pre-season block together, try and get some good players to practise with and pick up that level and get ready for Australia. We are very confident and hopeful that he will be back to his best.” 
Federer earlier in the week added to the feelgood bounce after their exhibition match in Glasgow, observing that he looked “pretty good” – although the former British players Tim Henman and Andrew Castle were less upbeat. Castle, who had hip problems towards the end of his career, was particularly pessimistic.
Murray refuses to talk about the exact nature of his hip injury, but it is thought to be no more than wear and tear after a long and physically demanding career. He has been encouraged during his rehab by his main coach, Ivan Lendl, who also suffered hip problems as a player.


Thanks to her father Damir, Jelena Dokic has had a notoriously strained relationship with the media. From coverage of him threatening US Open staff over the price of fish, to drunkenly smashing a reporter’s phone at Wimbledon or claiming the Australian Open draw was rigged against her, the media have been happy to embrace Damir as an oafish buffoon, ripe fodder for a click-bait headline or cartoon.
For a young Jelena Dokic, still underage when these incidents occurred, the reports were a source of deep shame and embarrassment – largely because she was unable to tell the public the truth. In her biography Unbreakable, she recounts how Damir would insist she trot out his own distorted worldviews at press conferences.
“When he made all those public rants, I had to cover for him and say what he wanted,” she tells the Guardian. “I know the media thought I was a brat and arrogant. That was really hard for me, because I was actually the opposite.”
Unbeknown to most around her, Dokic was enduring unspeakable emotional and physical abuse at the hands of her father – including regular beatings and whippings that on one occasion left her unconscious. But this side of her father remained concealed.
“The media would joke about everything he did. But it wasn’t funny. If you look at [those incidents] – he was aggressive, he was drunk, he was scary. No one ever asked: how far does this go? What else does he do?”
At the time, she wanted to tell the truth about his abuse, but feared for her life should she do so. “A lot of people didn’t understand me,” she says. “[But] I always thought, I’m going to write about this one day, I’m going to get the story out about what happened.”
The support has been incredible, and I feel good [having the story out there]
And so, in a twist of fate, Dokic – now aged 34 – has approached the media with open arms, welcoming rather than shying away from the spotlight again. She says the public reaction to her book – which has made headlines worldwide – has been something of a shock, given how acclimatised she had become to the abuse.
“I knew it would be big, but I didn’t know it would get such a reaction. For me, it’s more normal than it is to other people, because I’ve lived it, dealt with it for such a long time. The support has been incredible, and I feel good [having the story out there].”
She is aware her story has prompted, and will continue to prompt, questions as to why or how others could have intervened, but Dokic wants to make clear this is not about any personal vendetta. The book was instead written to incite change for others who are experiencing family violence.
“It’s not about pointing fingers, I’m not blaming anyone. It’s about moving forward,” she says. “Let’s take my case and build on this, learn from this. And if we need to put things in place, let’s put them in place to make sure it doesn’t happen again, and if it does, that the right steps are taken.”
In her own case, as is typical of family violence, she said those around her had been reluctant to get involved with an issue that was “happening behind closed doors”. “I know it’s difficult to get involved in a family situation,” she says. Nonetheless, Dokic believes there were people who could have, and should have, got involved.
“I don’t think everybody knew, but I know some people knew. I don’t have to name people, because they know who they are. I would certainly be asking myself questions if I was in a lot of people’s shoes.”
Things spiralled for Dokic after she managed to escape her father by signing over all her earnings to him. “People think once you leave an abusive situation you’re fine, but no, it’s just as bad. I battled, after that, with really bad depression and I almost committed suicide. I’d lost a lot of self-belief and self-confidence.
“I know the book is called Unbreakable, but in the end, he almost broke me. He really did. I was broken. All I wanted and needed was a kind word from someone. I just wanted someone to come talk to me, ask me if I needed anything. [But] people weren’t there.”
Part of the difficulty with Dokic’s story is that her father insisted on her switching allegiances to Serbia in 2000, just after she had lost a bronze medal match to Monica Seles in the Sydney Olympics, where she was an Australian ambassador. This move would isolate her from the country she had come to call home, and the few supporters she had, including Paul McNamee, who she described as “exceptional”.
It was in the same year that Dokic endured one of her most painful moments – being jeered on court at the Australian Open. Despite describing it in her book as “the worst moment not only of my career but my life”, Dokic does not blame the Australian public. “It was justified [the booing]. From the fans’ point of view, leaving the country and playing for someone else – it’s a betrayal.
“That was very hard for me – but it was my father who put me through that. That’s why I saw that decision as so outrageous, and I was so sad and angry that my father made me do that. If there’s one thing in my life and career I could change – this would be the one. I always felt Australian, I would never have left.”
I always felt Australian, I would never have left
For Dokic, however, her father’s abrupt decision to uproot her family yet again, brought back painful memories of experiencing racism and discrimination in Australia when arriving as a refugee in 1994. Her family had left for Sydney after escaping war-torn Yugoslavia, where Dokic’s grandfather was killed.
“I’m not saying Australia is racist, or everybody is racist, but when I came to Australia, I was told by junior players to ‘go back to where I came from’. Parents tried to argue that I wasn’t eligible for scholarships or funding, when I was No1 in every single age group.”
Representing Serbia, Dokic was seen as a “traitor” in the eyes of her compatriots – most notably her tennis peers – and again experienced isolation and exclusion, even when she returned to Australia of her own volition in 2005.
“I heard someone on the tennis scene in Australia say they wouldn’t have allowed me to come back to Australia let alone play the Australian Open or get a wildcard, and I knew some people felt that way.
“I would’ve loved to have talked to some people, to get them to understand, even be friends. But they, to be completely honest, didn’t give me a chance. I guess that was easier for them – to judge the situation – but in the end they had no idea. All those things led to me feeling like I wasn’t accepted by certain people, and ultimately my depression and almost committing suicide.”
At this point, Dokic reiterates that she does not want people to feel sorry for her, or for her story to be seen as an exercise in blame. “I don’t want pity. I’ve overcome this. I’m not complaining, this is about helping people,” she says.
She is not sure if Damir has read the book, as they no longer talk. “I’m sure he wouldn’t be too happy about it,” she says. “But at the end of the day, I’m the one who should be heard. If all he has to face is the fact that people know what he’s done – well, it was a lot worse for me. This story isn’t even about him, it’s much bigger picture than that.”
The story is, of course, one of family violence, an area Dokic hopes to move into with motivational speaking. But that may have to compete with a renewed appetite for taking to the courts.
“I’ve battled with physical issues, health issues, including my thyroid. I couldn’t get on court for a few years after retirement, but I’ve started hitting again and it has started being so enjoyable. I’m not sure I’ve ever enjoyed tennis as much as I enjoy going on the courts now.”
She’s not certain why that is, but admits that her best results – at a time when she reached No4 in the world – were achieved in fear.
“I certainly played with fear. And a lot of pressure – in a way it made me better, but it definitely meant I didn’t fulfil my potential. Could I have won a grand slam, been No1? Maybe. But I could have had a much longer career, and been a consistent top-10, top-five player.
“There might be a few years left. It would take a lot of work, but there’s certainly a will from me. I’ll think long and hard about it because I didn’t finish on my own terms.”
Until then, Dokic will commentate the Australian Open and summer of tennis – a game she says she continues to love, despite what she has endured.
“Certainly there were days when I couldn’t enjoy it because of what went on off the court, but I love tennis. I loved it from the first day I started playing and I think I always will.”


Before Ben Simmons played a single minute of NBA basketball, the comparisons were startling: the young Australian was being talked of as the next LeBron James, Magic Johnson or Oscar Robertson.
In today’s NBA, where many top prospects enter the league with just a solitary year of college basketball, such heady comparisons can often be a death knell. Yet for the special few, the pressure allows them to thrive.
Twelve games into Simmons’ NBA career, being mentioned in the same breath as Hall of Famers does not seem unwarranted.
The most interesting part of Simmons’ hot start to his NBA career isn’t that he has put up gaudy assist numbers, nor that his Philadelphia 76ers have put together a four-game winning streak. It’s that he has been able to have such success early in his career whilst being a non-shooter.
Like the league’s early-season MVP candidate Giannis Antetokounmpo, Simmons enters the league in an era where players with his shooting deficiencies rarely thrive.
To say the NBA is trending towards and beyond the three-point line is putting it lightly. Long distance shooting has become synonymous with winning – the best team in the league, the Golden States Warriors, centre their offense around the the three-point arc – and players who cannot extend the floor struggle to get minutes.
Given the trajectory of the league, how has Simmons managed to be so effective?
“Gravity” has become one of the NBA’s most popular buzzwords in the last five years. In basketball, the term refers to the way a defensive player can be pulled around the court. Golden State’s two-time MVP Stephen Curry is arguably the master of gravity due to his otherworldly shooting ability.
Wherever Curry is on the floor – and whether he is on the ball or off it – the entire defense is slanted towards him due to the shooting threat he poses, leaving acres of open space for his team-mates to wreak havoc. Curry’s gravity is how Golden State has been able to scythe through every defensive scheme it has encountered in the past three years.
However, Simmons carries a different type of gravity – gravity when it comes to his passing ability. Simmons’ assist numbers from the forward position are impressive – he is averaging 7.8 per game this season – but what is more impressive is the type of assists he has.
From the moment he stepped onto an NBA court, Simmons has demonstrated the rare ability to make the cross-court pass – with either hand – that James has made his own.
Simmons is averaging 2.05 assists per every turnover he makes which is extremely impressive given the types of passes he makes. Not only is he generating excellent looks for his team-mates, but he is taking care of the ball while he does it.
Put Simmons on the floor and he has the ability to find any one of his Sixer team-mates in any spot on the court.
Defenders know this when he is in possession – they cannot leave shooters as a second of hesitation or one misstep will allow Simmons enough time to deliver the perfect pass. Scan through every elite offense in the NBA, and they are unlocked by forwards who are masters of locating perimeter shooters. Simmons and Joel Embiid’s passing ability unlocks Philadelphia’s offense and already the former has put himself in the upper echelons of big man passers.
Without being a shooter, Simmons has done an outstanding job of leveraging the threat of his passing to score. Since defenders are reluctant to leave shooters, they can’t pack the paint as effectively on Simmons’ drives – the normal strategy against a non-shooter – and he has duly taken advantage. Simmons is converting 70% of all shots in the restricted area (0-3 feet from the basket), a number that ranks him among the league’s best.
Another key for a player who is not a prolific shooter is to be a threat off the ball, something Simmons has excelled at so far this season. Simmons’ unique blend of speed and strength at his position makes him a nightmare to defend on the move and he has used his athleticism to become an excellent off-ball scorer for the Sixers.
Simmons has converted a remarkable 69% of all shots where he has received the ball while cutting to the basket, a number that ranks higher than Kyrie Irving (60%) and Paul George (66%).
When quizzed about just how much more he can improve after Philadelphia’s game against Atlanta earlier in the season , Simmons’ answer suggested he knows the sky is the limit.
“There’s a lot more,” he said. “There’s way more. I mean, I’ve got to keep working hard and stay in the gym but I think in a few years it’s going to be fun.”
His game isn’t by any means perfect. The more game film opposition defenses get a hold of, the harder it will be for Simmons to score. He is still a below average free-throw shooter. But the warts in Simmons’ game are absolutely fixable, and he is far too hard a worker to not improve as a shooter.
But Simmons’ cerebral ability to read the game? That’s something that cannot be taught.


As the qualification process for Russia 2018 has amply demonstrated, no nation has a divine right to be at the World Cup. Not Italy, four-time world champions, nor the United States – who will be absent for the first time in three decades. Not Holland, inventors of total football with the illustrious Johan Cruyff, and certainly not Australia.
With 90 minutes standing between the Socceroos and a ticket to Russia, there is a strong feeling of déjà vu: Australian football has been here before. These qualifiers of consequence are alternatively nightmarish or euphoric for supporters. Few will forget Khodadad Azizi’s late equaliser in 1997, silencing a packed Melbourne Cricket Ground and sending Iran to the World Cup at Australia’s expense, or the Socceroos’ heavy 2001 defeat by Uruguay in Montevideo.
Four years later those wounds were salved in the most memorable manner possible, when John Aloisi fired past Uruguay goalkeeper Fabián Carini to secure qualification for Australia’s first World Cup since 1974. Replays of that penalty still induce shivers in most Socceroos fans. Will ANZ Stadium witness a repeat of such heroics on Wednesday evening, or are Honduras destined to join Iran and Uruguay in the pantheon of Australia’s sporting foes?
It is difficult to overstate the domestic importance of this encounter, the penultimate game of Fifa’s global qualification process that began in March 2015 (New Zealand face Peru on Thursday AEDT to determine the final World Cup participant). Australian football is in crisis, with a destructive governance feud threatening the game’s stability. The A-League, while quietly prosperous during season 13, feels only ever an incident or two away from calamity. Although the Socceroos have long united Australian football’s warring tribes, debate over coach Ange Postecoglou and his underperforming squad has been deeply polarising.
A goalless draw in San Pedro Sula last week did little to alleviate the nerves of anxious fans, concerned both about the immediate result and the longer term future. While the Socceroos were the better side in challenging Honduran conditions, striker Tomi Juric again fluffed his lines to leave Australia scoreless. The calculation for Postecoglou’s team is therefore simple: they must win in Sydney; a score draw of any kind will send Honduras to Russia courtesy of the away goal rule.
Three factors should give Australia the necessary edge. Honduras were inept in their home environs, and will need a qualitative improvement in form to have any hope of matching the Socceroos over another 90 minutes. Australia should also be in superior physical condition, after Football Federation Australia chartered a flight home while the Hondurans endured a draining transit on commercial airlines via Houston and Dallas. The futuristic jet-lag reducing glasses may have drawn derision in some quarters, but FFA’s no-expense-spared approach could have real benefits if the match is finely poised late in the second half.
The additions of Robbie Kruse, Mathew Leckie and Mark Milligan – who all remained in Australia due to injury or suspension – will also be a significant boost. Mercurial playmaker Tom Rogic only played the final quarter of the first leg while veteran striker Tim Cahill remained on the bench, such that Australia’s attacking resources are collectively well-rested.
This is not to dismiss the Central Americans – who surged to the intercontinental play-off spot with four unbeaten performances – but the advantage is firmly with Australia. It may sound trite, yet it bears repeating that if the Socceroos cannot beat Honduras, the team truly does not deserve to be among the world’s best in Russia. For now at least, the World Cup remains a meritocracy.
Wednesday’s game feels like an inflection point for the Socceroos. Qualification for Russia 2018 would close the door on a turbulent two years for the game in Australia, giving the financial and status-based stability that may facilitate much-needed broader reform. Non-qualification will be disastrous – not existential, but certainly capable of negatively impacting the prosperity of Australian football for a generation.
Australian football stakeholders are presently divided, over Postecoglou’s tenure, a second-tier national league, the optimal governance structure and a thousand other issues. On Wednesday they will momentarily unite in the cauldron of ANZ Stadium, for the most important national team game in 12 years. After a torturous qualification journey with stops across the globe, the Socceroos’ day of reckoning has arrived.


These are exciting times for the kind of people who pretend watching scoreless draws isn’t mind-numbingly boring, preferring to pretentiously liken them to chess matches … which of course aren’t tedious to watch at all. Following competitive goal-free, drear-draws between Honduras and the Sheilaroos, Denmark and the Republic O’Ireland, New Zealand and Peru, Switzerland and Norn Iron Nil, Greece and Croatia, Italy and Sweden, O’Ireland and the Danes will again face each other across the chessboard in Dublin, with a place at the World Cup up for grabs.
Sailing up the Liffey in their team longboat with the giant figurehead of granite-jawed Euro 92 legend Kim Vilfort staring menacingly ahead from its prow, the Danes arrived with the jeers of thousands of their unhappy compatriots still ringing in their ears. It seemed they didn’t quite view their team’s failure to score at Copenhagen’s Parken Stadium against O’Ireland over 90 minutes as being like a chess match, unless there’s some new variation of the game that involves Shane Duffy, Steven Ward and Darren Randolph booting any pawn, bishop or rook that comes near them as far as is humanly possible in the vague direction of Daryl Murphy or Shane Long.
“We tried and tried, but it was a bit like opening a can of baked beans with your bare hands – it takes time,” sighed Denmark’s O’Irish-sounding midfielder Thomas Delaney, who is clearly unfamiliar with the new ring-pulls which adorn modern-day bean cans and afford anyone with even the most rudimentary motor skills access to the tomatoey, beany goodness inside within seconds through the use of their bare hands. And to think some people say footballers are divorced from reality.
While the Danes could still be considered to have the advantage in so far as a score draw will see them through to Russia 2018, the O’Irish are unlikely to help them take advantage of this state of affairs by upholding their end of the bargain and getting a goal. “It would be lovely to have a prolific goalscorer in the side,” honked Martin O’Neill, whose first-choice striker has three international goals in 27 appearances and whose second-choice striker hasn’t scored in his past 30 games. “If you don’t have that, then you have to try to find other ways.” Of course, another scoreless draw, the seventh in seven consecutive World Cup eliminators around the globe, is the only result which would lead to Tuesday’s chess match going to penalties. Spot-kicks it almost certainly will be, then … although whether or not anyone will manage to successfully score one remains to be seen.

“I cried a few tears. Look at some of the older players who felt that this was the last chance to make it to a World Cup – and now we did it. It’s indescribable” – Sweden manager Jan Andersson reflects on his team keeping Italy out of a World Cup finals for the first time in 60 years. While trying to avoid the inevitable exuberance.
USA! USA!! USA!!!, Holland, Scotland … heavy hitter after heavy hitter has fallen by the wayside on the road to Russia 2018, but now they’ve been joined by Italy. Shambolic Italy.

Anyway, here’s Paolo Bandini’s big read on the decline of the Azzurri, while you can be entertained by the in-no-way-over-the-top Italian press reaction and generally funky fan verdict, while feeling a bit bad for Gigi Buffon, but not bad at all for Carlo Tavecchio.

“Re: Neighbours/football stories (yesterday’s Fiver letters). On my flamin’ travels in 2012 I attended a ‘Neighbours Night’ in Melbourne, where I briefly bonded with ‘Dr’ Karl Kennedy over a shared love of Liverpool. He was a lovely bloke and knew his stuff.

Eddie Jones has dropped George Kruis and called on reinforcements for England’s crunch match against Australia, with Owen Farrell looking likely to feature and Joe Marler making an immediate return to the matchday squad for Saturday.
Farrell was rested for the 21-8 victory over Argentina last week but is in line to take part against the Wallabies as Alex Lozowski was among the nine players sent back to their clubs on Tuesday night. Marler comes straight back into the fold after his three-week suspension, replacing Ellis Genge, and is certain to play some part against Australia as one of only six front-rowers in the squad. He will compete with Mako Vunipola for a starting spot.
Kruis, meanwhile, appears to have paid the price for a below-par showing against Argentina and as his absence is not injury-enforced, it looks to be evidence of his continued slide down the pecking order. He missed the Six Nations due to a knee injury and while he recovered to take his place on the British & Irish Lions tour, he was dropped after the first Test defeat by New Zealand. Maro Itoje has been named in the 25-man squad and could take Kruis’s place in the starting XV but Jones has also decided to retain Bath’s Charlie Ewels, along with Courtney Lawes and Joe Launchbury, as second-row options.
Lozowski’s omission seems harsh considering he provided one of the few bright spots from the bench against the Pumas with an eye-catching second-half run. His return to Saracens, however, suggests Farrell is set for a place in the matchday 23.
If, as is likely, only one back from the 25 drops out, Mike Brown is the most likely to make way. He is still progressing through the return-to-play protocols following a head injury against Argentina and is unable to train before Jones selects his starting XV. If Brown does sit it out, Anthony Watson is likely to move to full-back, though Elliot Daly is another option, particularly with Jonny May fit again to contest the left-wing berth. Jones could also conceivably use Daly’s versatility for a 6-2 split on his bench, as was the case in the second and third Tests of England’s 3-0 whitewash in Australia last year.
Semesa Rokoduguni is also retained among the back-three options, having scored the decisive second try against Argentina, and has been giving a ringing endorsement by Australia’s Fiji-born wing Marika Koroibete, a potential opponent on Saturday. “I’ve watched a lot of him. He’s an exciting player and is good on the ball. I haven’t met him but he’s a good player,” he said. “It doesn’t matter what jersey you wear, after the game we are mates. We will look after each other after the game and talk – that is just how it is. There are a lot of international Fijian wings around the world and it is good to come up against them and test your potential.”
Koroibete is fast becoming a mainstay of the Wallabies’ side and is yet to taste defeat in his six Tests so far, racking up wins against New Zealand, and last week Wales, along the way. This time last year he was part of the touring party but is now set for his Twickenham debut. “I was a passenger and I was settling in, sitting in the crowd watching the boys, enjoying the atmosphere,” he added.
Koroibete also wished Wales’s Jonathan Davies a speedy recovery as it was his tackle that caused the foot injury which will keep the British & Irish Lions centre sidelined for six months. He said: “It was unlucky. I made my tackle and he landed on his foot – I feel sorry for him and hope he recovers.”

The sports minister, Tracey Crouch, has urged the Football Association to take up Eni Aluko’s offer to help it reform after agreeing its reputation had been “tarnished” by the way it treated the former England player. Crouch also warned the FA it had to quickly learn lessons from the case and that the necessary changes to its culture had to come “right from the top”.
However, Crouch stopped short of saying the FA was not fit for purpose, and gave her qualified backing to the under-fire chairman, Greg Clarke, who she insisted is on a journey to improve the organisation.
“The FA handled the Eni Aluko case really badly,” Crouch told the digital, culture, media and sport select committee. “It was a mess and it has quite rightly taken the shine off the work the FA has done to reform. A cultural shift takes time. Eni Aluko has said that she wants to be part of that change. I hope they listen to her. I think she has a lot to offer. She would be a great asset in driving those culture reforms.”
Crouch also dismissed Clarke’s claim to parliament last month that he had been unable to investigate Aluko’s case after she reported deeply inappropriate comments by the former England Women’s team manager Mark Sampson under sports governance rules. However, although she pointed out that Clarke was wrong, she later generously described it as “an innocent misinterpretation”.
And while agreeing that Clarke and the FA chief executive Martin Glenn’s disastrous performance in front of the DCMS last month had not painted the organisation in a good light, Crouch refused several times to say whether it was fit for purpose.
“It is not for the minister to say whether the chair or chief executive should be in place,” she said. “We would go down a very dangerous place if you want me to fire them. Because if I can fire them I can hire them. And you do not want a minister of state to have that power. We sit here and criticise Russia and China but this would be the same.”
Crouch also balanced her criticisms of the FA by pointing out the progress that had been made in many areas, including term limits for board members and a plan for better diversity on the board.
Elsewhere, Crouch hinted that she was amenable to the idea of an independent sports ombudsman to investigate cases of bullying, discrimination and other cases of wrongdoing in British sport. The government is yet to give its response to the idea, which is a key recommendation of a cultural review of UK Sport by Dame Tanni Grey-Thompson, but Crouch said she was looking closely at the proposal.
“We recognise there are issues that need to be addressed in sport and, especially, elite sport,” she said. “We are looking at the recommendations in some detail – in particular in relationship to the ombudsmen. I think it is an idea we need to explore more. However, once we have the right grievance policies in place in individual sports we might not need to have an independent ombudsman.”
Crouch also accepted that there needs to be far better ways for whistleblowers to come forward without fear of discrimination or losing their jobs.
“No matter where you work you should not be subject to bullying, discrimination or harassment,” she said. “It is really important we have those safeguards in place for whistleblowers.”
Tellingly, when asked whether there were any national governing bodies with strong whistleblowing policies, she said she “couldn’t think of any off the top of my head”.
It was also put to Crouch that UK Sport had only one person employed on athlete welfare. “That is something they are addressing‚” she replied. “The new chair, Katherine Grainger, has come in with a very different background and will put the athlete right at the heart of what UK Sport is doing. They are looking to beef up the athlete voice. There is change happening in UK Sport.”
There have also been calls for elite British athletes to be treated as employees by UK Sport, rather than just being recipients of grants, so that they could get better protections at work. However, Crouch stopped short of backing the idea, calling it “a complex issue”.
“When you do that it changes National Insurance and pensions, these are things that have to be looked at,” she added. “Ultimately we do have a structure in place that supports a high-performance programme.”
More than 15 gymnasts, coaches and parents have come forward to the Guardian in recent days to discuss the problems in the sport, including bullying, as well as being critical of the behaviour of the chief executive of British Gymnastics, Jane Allen. However, Crouch told the committee she did not think British Gymnastics was in crisis. “The new chief executive is working very hard to change the culture and has introduced some of the best safeguarding practices in all the national bodies,” she added. “I don’t believe British Gymnastics is in crisis, as has been suggested.”


Amid the hurly-burly and hot air that inevitably accompanies the weeks before the Brisbane Test England have encountered some genuine problems. Ben Stokes is still in the northern hemisphere and likely to remain there; Steven Finn became the late replacement who departed early with a knee problem; Jake Ball twisted an ankle in Adelaide; young fast bowlers like Tom Curran and George Garton have been summoned from afar. But there may be a beneficiary from all these setbacks and that is Somerset’s Craig Overton.
Overton was selected in the original tour party ahead of Finn but the assumption was that he would be there as the rookie, to learn, to improve and possibly to play a Test or two later in the series. When Stokes was sidelined the door was ajar; there was the chance he could squeeze into the team as the fourth seamer, partly because of his batting prowess. Now, after the injuries to Finn and Ball, that door is wide open. Overton is on course to play in Brisbane.
So he may have to receive more attention from the Aussies. From Townsville onwards they may seek to undermine the new boy’s confidence. “Batting prowess? He got a pair in the last match.” They could even dredge up the famous slur directed at Mark Waugh all those years ago – “He’s not even the best cricketer in his family.” It is true that twin brother Jamie is a quicker bowler with great potential but the stats demonstrate that the senior Overton, by a few minutes, is currently the better bet – and less hindered by injury.
There will be at least one Australian wishing Overton well while still hoping for a home victory at the Gabba. Chris Rogers, the former Test opener, knew the Overtons long before he ended up as their captain at Somerset in 2016. Rogers played for North Devon CC at Instow, an idyllic coastal venue if the wind is not blowing too fiercely, when the twins were in shorts and their father was in the team.
The Overtons are proud Devonians. They went to West Buckland School near Barnstaple, like one of Somerset’s tragic heroes of the past, Harold Gimblett. They progressed through the Devon youth system and on to the Somerset Academy. Apart from the inevitable stress fractures along the way there was never much doubt they would become huge assets for the club.
The twins are just about identical. When the South African coach Dave Nosworthy came to Somerset he admitted he could never tell them apart until he saw them bowling. Craig does not run quite so far as Jamie, the process is slightly less frantic and there is not the same headlong pursuit of pace. He can swing the ball away; taking advantage of his height (both are 6ft 5in) he can hit the shoulder of the bat more often than most and is more accurate than his brother. Craig has already been selected for England white-ball squads without ever playing – there was much mumbling and grumbling at Taunton this summer when he was omitted from the T20 match there against South Africa. In fact he is currently a much better red-ball bowler.
There have been setbacks along the way. The most troubling stemmed from an incident at Sussex in 2015 when Overton abused Ashar Zaidi. He was subsequently banned for two matches. At the time this might have been regarded as the naive outburst of a young firebrand – for the Overtons have always been combative cricketers. That was my initial assumption. Then talking to umpires it became apparent that Overton’s behaviour on the field was too often near the edge and ultimately self-destructive. Any sane bowler seeks to nurture a good rapport with the umpires.
Matthew Maynard, then the coach at Somerset, acknowledged there was more to this than over-exuberance. There were real anger issues and expert guidance was sought. It is to the credit of both Maynard and Overton that they recognised a problem, addressed it and it seems to have been resolved.
In 2017 Overton, along with Jack Leach, was a key contributor to Somerset’s survival in the first division. However his all-rounder status waned – with a highest score of 46 in the Championship and an average in the teens. He can bat, despite what they think in Adelaide. He is a natural striker of the ball but he is not yet good enough to attempt long Test match style innings. So if he plays at the Gabba he should stick with what has worked in the past: to be mean with the ball and aggressive with the bat. And if he succeeds expect Rogers to be one of the first to congratulate him, albeit with a carefully disguised whisper.


LiAngelo Ball, Cody Riley and Jalen Hill, the UCLA basketball players held in China over allegations of shoplifting, are on their way back to the United States.
According to the Wall Street Journal, the trio were seen checking into a flight bound for LA at Shanghai’s Pudong International Airport on Tuesday. The Pac-12 later confirmed the report and UCLA said the players will appear at a news conference on Wednesday, along with their coach Steve Alford. LiAngelo Ball is the brother of Los Angeles Lakers rookie Lonzo Ball.
Earlier on Tuesday, Donald Trump said he had a long conversation on the matter with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping. “They’re working on it right now,” Trump told reporters in the Philippines as he prepared to return to Washington after a visit to Asia that included an earlier stop in Beijing. “He’s been terrific,” Trump said, in an apparent reference to Xi.
On Monday, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said that three American men were being investigated in the eastern city of Hangzhou for alleged theft and that China and the US were in contact over the matter. “China will handle this case in accordance with law and protect the lawful rights and interests of the people involved,” Geng said.
Chinese authorities detained the UCLA freshmen for questioning last week about allegations of shoplifting before a recent game against Georgia Tech in Shanghai. The UCLA team returned to the US without them on Saturday.
ESPN last week reported the players could be Hangzhou for “a week or two” while the situation is resolved. ESPN said there is surveillance footage of the players shoplifting from three stores inside a high-end mall. They were questioned when allegedly taking sunglasses from a branch of Louis Vuitton.


Arsène Wenger has spoken of the possibility of a move into international football and being involved at the 2022 World Cup. The Arsenal manager, who according to some reports was the Football Association’s first choice for the England manager’s post after the departure of Roy Hodgson in 2016, has 18 months to run on his contract at the Emirates but says the idea of managing at a World Cup is a tempting prospect.
When asked about the possibility of moving into international management, Wenger told beIN Sports: “Maybe, yes, I will do it at some stage but until now I like to be involved every day in the life of a club because the real test is there. Four or five weeks is a different experience, it’s more concentrated, but I believe the real experience of managing a team is on a daily basis.
“But I will not always have the physical strength to do that so maybe I will move into [international coaching]. It’s a fact my life is linked with football, in what way will be linked to my physical state.”
The Frenchman added: “I will [always] be in football. I don’t know [if] as a director, as a manager – as long as possible as a manager. But one day that will stop. But I will stay in football, of course.” Asked whether he could be on the bench at the World Cup in Qatar, he said: “Maybe, you never know.”

Wenger, who has also been linked with the France national team, commented on the speculation about his taking the England post last year when he said: “My priority is to do well here [at Arsenal]. If I am free one day why not, but at the moment my focus is on my job.”
Petr Cech, meanwhile, has dismissed suggestions that Arsenal should measure their season on whether they finish above Tottenham as they prepare for Saturday’s north London derby.
“There is always one odd year where things can change, but the most important thing for us is competing against the other teams for the Premier League title and for the glory,” the goalkeeper told Sky Sports. “We are not competing against Tottenham Hotspur. Two years ago when we finished above them we were disappointed because we didn’t win the title [and Leicester did]. Our target is to win the title and be successful during the season, not necessarily looking at what Tottenham are doing.”
Despite their progress under Mauricio Pochettino, Spurs have failed to win a trophy since the League Cup in 2008 and Cech believes only silverware will satisfy the Tottenham supporters. “There was always something missing. They’ve been there in the last few years so now I think they have to make sure they win something to show the progression.”


Sergio García has admitted a his split with TaylorMade equipment was not solely of his own volition, with the 2017 Masters champion hinting riches bestowed on other players impacted on contract negotiations. García will use Callaway clubs in this week’s DP World Tour Championship, with a formal agreement imminent.
The circuit reacted with surprise to news that García, fresh from a first major success and after 15 years with TaylorMade, was on the lookout for a new equipment supplier. TaylorMade separated from its parent company, Adidas, in May. Around the same time Rory McIlroy signed a 10-year contract with the company worth a potential $100m while Tiger Woods became a TaylorMade player in January.
“It wasn’t only my decision,” said García. “I spent 15 years with TaylorMade but unfortunately things come to an end.”
Pressed on the reasons for the split, García added: “All companies change and the politics with TaylorMade have changed after eaving Adidas. We couldn’t come to an agreement.
“I understand that it’s also difficult when you have so many top players, to keep all of them. Unfortunately we were in that package.”
Asked if he had signed with Callaway, García said: “Not yet. But at the moment it’s the company that’s in front of the other ones.
“I would say the most difficult thing to fit into your game would be the ball, when you have played with one for quite a while. With what we have been testing, the numbers have been really good with the balls that Callaway has brought to me. Now it’s just a matter of trying it on the course and trying it in tournament play. If there are any changes that need to be made then we have time in the off-season to get it sorted out. Hopefully, we won’t have to.”
García’s apparent indifference towards taking the European Tour’s order of merit title has been a recurring theme in recent times. The 37-year-old would win the Race to Dubai should he prevail at this tournament and if Tommy Fleetwood and Justin Rose falter. Yet, again, García rather shrugged off such an outcome. He had earlier refused to add extra events to his schedule in a bid to make up ground on the top two.
“Winning the Race to Dubai would be great but I’m not going to change my whole life for it,” he said. “I’m happy finishing second, third, fourth or wherever I finish at the end of the week.
“What I’m going to do is go out there and try to do the same as every other week, which is play the best I can and give myself the best option of winning this week. I can’t control what other people do. Tommy and Justin are playing really well.
“So I’m not expecting them to finish 40th or 50th. To be totally honest, I see a 2% chance of me winning the Race to Dubai. But I’m fine with it, I can live with it. It has been a great year and that’s not going to change.”
The same applies to Jon Rahm, who has picked up the European Tour’s rookie of the year award. The 23-year-old has arrived at the Tour’s final event of 2017 ranked No5 in the world.
“Never in a million years could I have expected to achieve what I have done,” Rahm admitted. “Top five in the world, fifth in the FedEx Cup, fourth in the Race to Dubai, a Rolex Series win, a champion at Torrey Pines, playing the way I have; I would never have foreseen this at all.
“I’m really proud of what has happened this year. I know it is hard to keep it going but hopefully I can keep it going.”


For all its long, rich history for indulging boozers and gamblers and rakes, one vice cricketers never really seem to have acquired is doping. So far as the sport has ever had a problem, it’s been with the drugs that impair performance, rather the ones that enhance it. Plenty of cricketers have been caught, and occasionally even confessed to using, cannabis, cocaine, even, in one especially recherché recent case, opium. So far as PEDs go though, there have been a handful of players banned because they’d taken masking agents, usually diet pills or the like, or steroids of one kind or another. But almost no one has ever confessed to doing it deliberately. Cricket, then, would seem to be clean, or as close to it as any modern-day sport gets.
Which, conversely, already suggests that it might be more vulnerable than it appears, unless you believe that cricketers are immune to the temptations other sportspeople succumb to. If no one’s being caught, you have to ask how hard anyone’s looking. The ICC recently stepped up its anti-doping programme. At the Champions Trophy earlier this year, it started blood testing for the first time, a move which was wildly overdue because the urine tests it had been using can’t detect human growth hormone. The blood testing will allow it to set up a biological passport system, which will allow it to scan for the effects of doping over time, if not detect the substance or method itself. It’s a leap forward for the sport’s anti-doping programme at the elite level.
Cricket may not have a doping problem right now, but the course of the sport is in a direction in which one may well develop. For a long time a lot of fans have relied on the lazy thinking that because cricket’s so skill-driven, it’s safe. And of course it’s true that PEDs won’t necessarily help a batsman hit a cover drive, or a spinner turn his googly, just as they can’t help a shot putter hone his throwing technique or a sprinter improve his start. The 101 lesson here is that athletes dope for two reasons: to make themselves stronger, and to help themselves train harder and recover quicker.
As T20 continues to grow, those very qualities have become more important then ever before. There are a lot of cricketers competing for a small number of lucrative short-term contracts, the rewards are greater, the off-season shorter, and the consequences of injuries more severe. Human Growth Hormone can make a huge difference to the amount of time it takes for an athlete to recover from a musculoskeletal injury. Some studies have shown that an athlete using it can recover as much as six-times faster than they would without it. Which could easily be the difference between being out until next season, or being back in time for that big match in the knock-out rounds.
At the same time, T20 has put more of an onus on strength and power. Sixes sell. And a player can make themselves a name, and a lot of money, if they hit them hard enough, often enough. The skills a player needs in T20 are more akin to the set they use in baseball, a sport which has been struggling to control its own doping problem for decades now. And if the ICC has a good grip on anti-doping in its own events, it’s a lot harder to implement a consistent programme in all those new T20 leagues mushrooming around the world. You can get an idea of the difficulties by looking at the current situation in the world’s leading T20 league, the IPL.
There’s a reason the issue of anti-doping is bubbling up right now. The long-running soap opera at the BCCI has an old plot thread about the board’s anti-doping programme, which has come centre stage these last few weeks. The board is in dispute with India’s Department of Sports and the National Anti-Doping Agency. This has been going on since the mid-2000s, when the ICC first signed up to work with the World Anti-Doping Agency. The BCCI refused to commit to Wada’s whereabouts system, because its star players were worried about the security risk they’d be taking if they revealed their home addresses to the drug-testers.
Instead, after a year of negotiations, the BCCI and the ICC concocted a bespoke anti-doping programme which broadly satisfied both parties, and so, in 2011, the sport became Wada-compliant. India, meanwhile, outsourced their domestic doping control to a private firm based in Sweden, International Doping Tests & Management, who now operate the anti-doping programme for the IPL and other domestic competitions. But in April this year, Wada ran an audit of India’s National Anti-Doping Agency, and found that because the BCCI doesn’t recognise Nada’s authority, or allow it to conduct any tests at its events, Nada is in contravention of the Wada code.
The immediate question, then, is one of jurisdiction. The Indian Department of Sport asked the BCCI to allow Nada to run an anti-doping programme in domestic cricket. Wada increased the pressure on the BCCI by revealing that one of the BCCI’s accredited players did fail a recent doping test, without revealing who it was or what substance he had tested positive for. But just last week, the BCCI refused to comply. The BCCI argues that since it’s technically an autonomous body and not a national sports federation, Nada doesn’t have the right to be involved in its operation.
The BCCI’s anti-doping set-up is run by Vece Paes, father of the tennis player Leander Paes. And, by its own account, it is robust, better, perhaps, than Nada’s own. It says it doesn’t need the additional scrutiny. The squabble between the two seems to have become yet another baroque power struggle for control over an aspect of the sport in India. But the upshot is that the issue of anti-doping has become politicised, and, as a result, opaque, confused, and convoluted. The ICC, meanwhile, seems reluctant to publicly comment, much less intervene in the dispute. No doubt cricketers have the motive to dope. The question is, whether they have the opportunity, too.

The perennial argument about whether the Cheltenham Festival is too much of a good thing has been reignited this morning by James Knight, who holds a senior position at Ladbrokes Coral. Knight goes so far as to say that the Festival’s best races are “ridiculously hyped” and “done to death”.
The absurd Cheltenham obsession in NH racing needs to be reversed. There are several excellent races during the rest of the season that are just as good as (if not better than) the ridiculously hyped and done-to-death Championship Festival races.
I can’t agree. The fundamental point for me is that the Festival is a wonderful occasion, enjoyed by people far beyond the ordinary limits of horse racing’s appeal, which must also have been an introduction to jump racing for many who now follow it closely.
Of course there are always things that can be done to strengthen the rest of the season and I dare say the sport’s rulers will continue to think about that. But I’m basically comfortable with the season as it is and worry that increased promotion of other events could detract from Cheltenham.
After all, jumps horses are not made of granite. They do not all stay sound and healthy if you race them repeatedly. If you bring them to a peak for some new event in January, they may struggle to reproduce that form in March. At the start of each year, we get disappointing news about high-profile horses that have been ruled out of Cheltenham with some setback or other. Promoting other targets earlier in the season will increase the risk of such injuries.
We’re in a golden time of the year for jump racing fans, with good-quality racing each Saturday. There’s the Mackeson (as was), the Betfair Chase, the Hennessy (as was), the Tingle Creek, the December Gold Cup, the SGB (as was) and the King George. If you find yourself thinking that one or two of them are “substandard renewals”, just try picking the winner.
I intend to enjoy all of those races, and the others on those cards, enormously. After they’ve been run, I’ll think about whether the winners or the beaten horses might win something at Cheltenham or Aintree, secure in the knowledge that connections would love to do that if they possibly could and will not wrong-foot me by aiming at some other event I hadn’t considered (a regular problem on the Flat). Now, how can this be a bad thing?
British Flat racing would love to have a climactic focal point like the Cheltenham Festival and has spent an obscene amount of money trying to contrive one. Let’s remember the value of what we already have.
The Guardian has managed to put together four winning naps in a row, so I dare say the whole edifice is about to come crashing down around my ears. Cheltenam De Vaige (3.10) carries the burden today and not just because I’m obsessed with Cheltenham, you understand.
Having passed through the yards of Giles Smyly and Mark Wall, he joined Fergal O’Brien for this season and came up short by just half a length on his debut for the yard at Plumpton last month. Another half-mile will help and he should be a bit sharper this time, so I like him, though 6-4 in a 15-runner handicap is hardly finding money in the street.
Kim Bailey has a couple of handicap chasers running for him for the first time today at Lingfield and both have been backed. The ex-Irish Lake Field (1.50) is the one that interests me at 11-2 from 8s, he having winning form that makes him look well-treated if Bailey has got him firing again. Carqalin, who runs at 3.50pm, is 7-2 from 9s after joining Bailey from David Pipe’s. Given that the grey has never yet finished within 20 lengths of a winner, I can watch him unbacked at those odds.
Keel Haul (2.50) might be a bit big at 14-1, if he’s fitter for his reappearance. Henry Oliver’s charge is a stone below his last winning mark and still capable of running well, on the evidence of last season. His second outing was his best of last term, judged by Racing Post Ratings.
At Worcester, the money seems to be coming for Finula (2.30), who is back to 14s after drifting to 20s. He was running a big race at Warwick in May when unseating three-out, in his handicap debut and with a first-time tongue tie on. He’s 1lb lower now.

Anthony Ogogo has been an Olympic bronze medallist, a model and a participant on Strictly Come Dancing. He was a boxer then and, more than ever, he is a fighter now. The 28‑year‑old middleweight, however, has not stepped into the ring for over a year. Ogogo has been engaged in a far more brutal battle to protect his eyesight and salvage his career.
On 22 October 2016, in his 12th professional fight against Craig Cunningham, Ogogo lost his unbeaten record on an eighth-round stoppage after a blow which fractured his left eye-socket in seven places. The consequences have taken a terrible toll on Ogogo – physically, emotionally, psychologically and financially – but he retains a fierce desire to box on.
After 90 minutes, in which the traditional question-answer format of an interview has been turned into an impassioned monologue from Ogogo, I make a rare interruption. After all he has endured why does Ogogo want to return to the most dangerous sport of all? Why risk more heartbreak when he could make a decent living as a charismatic TV pundit or reality show star?
“I’ve got this image in my head,” Ogogo says. “I want to be knighted when I’m old. I want to inspire so many people. I want to box like Anthony Joshua is doing now. I come from a small town, Lowestoft, and a single‑parent family. We were five kids and we were poor. I’ve scraped and clawed to hopefully, someday, become someone. If I can do it, anybody can do anything. But to complete this story of me overcoming adversity, I need to become world champion. I’m nowhere near that yet. That’s why I’m still fighting.
“This last year has been rubbish. It’s been the worst year of my life. Luckily I found the best people in the world with my eye situation. If I wasn’t so obsessive my career would have been over a long time ago. But it is very lonely.”
To complete this story of me overcoming adversity, I need to become world champion. I’m nowhere near that yet
Ogogo has shown me pictures of his wedding to Casey, when his eye was still puffy and shut after surgery, and so what does his wife think of his determination to box again? “My wife is amazing and an absolute sweetheart. She understands. But she’s a teacher and she can’t get time off during school. My last surgery I flew to America on my own, I found the hospital on my own. I had surgery, discharged myself, went back to my hotel, took a plane and came home alone. You’ve got to be mentally strong to do that. But I’m skint. I’ve paid for all my surgeries and it’s ridiculously expensive. I had to remortgage my house to pay for my last surgery. I’ll have to find the money for the next one somehow.”
Ogogo flies to the US in three weeks for another procedure which, if successful, should allow him to pass any tests that the British Boxing Board of Control will insist on him taking. He hopes to fight again once his training regime includes hard sparring and he would love to vanquish his defeat by Cunningham – a decent pro with a 19-2 record. But Cunningham has none of the star appeal of Ogogo, who was once expected to match Joshua, his London 2012 team-mate, as a force in British boxing.
We revisit the fight which darkened Ogogo’s world. “I was bashing up guys much better than Cunningham in sparring. I felt great. I expected to be world champion by this time in 2017. I came out for the first round and Cunningham’s a southpaw. Our legs got tangled in an unintentional collision. It could have been a forearm or a head but I thought: ‘Fucking hell, what’s happened?’ The right eye was showing Cunningham way over there and my left eye had twisted out. It was like I was being hit by someone while I’m lying on my side.
“I didn’t say anything to my corner and, in round two, I didn’t know if he was two foot or 20 foot away. I didn’t see the punches coming until I was hit. He dropped me but it wasn’t a big punch. I just didn’t see it. My left hand was tight to my head the whole fight because I couldn’t see him throwing a hook. He hit me so many times in the hand that, at one point, I backed away. I thought he was well away from me. I dropped my hands because I was so tired and he’s whacked me. I couldn’t see he was right in front of me.”
Fighting blind, Ogogo still believed he could win. “He was breathing heavy, and I thought: ‘I’ll knock him out.’ I threw a right hook with so much gusto. But I missed by a mile and did a 360-degree spin. My corner know how good I am and Tony Sims [his co-trainer] said: ‘What’s going on?’ I couldn’t say because I knew if I did they’d pull me out. I said: ‘I’m fine.’ He was confused because normally after a big shot your words are slurred. But I was so coherent.
“The vision was so bad I eventually came back to the corner and he said: ‘How many fingers am I holding?’ I was seeing two hands, two faces. I guessed and said: ‘Four.’ He said” ‘I’ve got no fingers up.’ He tricked me because he knew my eye was gone. Tony said: ‘The fight’s over.’ I was devastated because I thought I’d stay undefeated. But I do appreciate my team looking out for me and my welfare by pulling me out. It was 100% the right decision.
“I went to a specialist at Moorfields [eye hospital, in London] and they did eye tests. She asked: ‘What are these letters?’ I couldn’t see them. She said: ‘You should be classed as blind because you can’t read these four letters.’ I saw 10 different doctors because there were seven fractures. The issue was the eye-socket – which protects the eyeball and the muscles which move the eye. The eye-socket had to be repaired but there was soft-tissue damage. These eye muscles are as thin as clingfilm and they don’t repair themselves like a leg muscle. All they can do is go into the good eye and weaken the muscle to replicate it so that both eyes are aligned. At the moment my eyes don’t work together. They look in different directions. It’s a squint. My right eye is lower than the left.
“But the left eye-socket is now stronger than before. The orbital floor where the eye sits is like eggshell. Kell Brook had a plate inserted [after his eye‑socket was dislocated twice by Gennady Golovkin and Errol Spence]. But a plate can still get bent. Professor Simon Holmes at the Royal London Hospital did my orbital repair and he put in something thicker and sturdier – so it can’t break. He was great.
“I’ve now just got the height discrepancy between my eyes. He’s going to do my next surgery on 6 December so that the eyes are realigned. He believes he can get me back. I may have to change my style to compensate but I would cut my leg off to box again. Fingers crossed one more surgery and I’ll be back.”
Ogogo must have believed on many occasions he would never fight again? “No. I just thought: ‘How are my eyes going to get better?’ The ‘How?’ was so big. There have been some very dark moments. I went to the gym the first time after surgery and tried to punch the heavy bag. I missed it completely.”
That shocking lack of vision forced Ogogo to seek the help of an eminent surgeon in the US. He also has found the strength to persevere because he has grown used to adversity. Six weeks before London 2012 his mother nearly died after a brain haemorrhage. “When people ask me about the Olympics I’ve got a generic answer because they want to hear how good it was. I go: ‘Yeah, it was great.’ But it was the worst time in my life. When they said: ‘We’re going to turn off her life support machine,’ I was speechless – which for me is tough.”
Ogogo smiles at his talkative nature before explaining how he insisted on her life-saving transfer to Addenbrooke’s hospital – where his mum was restored finally to good health. But on his first day back in training, just weeks before the Olympics, Ogogo cracked a rib. He was then drawn against the world No1 middleweight Ievgen Khytrov of Ukraine in the second round.
Despite his rib, and not eating and sleeping properly while worrying about his mum, Ogogo beat Khytrov and won two other fights at London 2012. He was still bitterly disappointed to lose in the semi-finals to Brazil’s Esquiva Falcão Florentino. “It still hurts now. I know this sounds nasty and people would give their left arm for an Olympic medal but to me it’s a piece of shit because it should have been a gold. Hopefully one day I’ll look back on it as a real achievement. Five years on it’s still too raw.”
Signed by Oscar De La Hoya as a pro, Ogogo seemed destined for a glittering career. But he has had only 12 fights in four and a half years. He was out for a whole year with a damaged achilles. On his return in July 2015, fighting Ruslan Schelev in Germany, his shoulder was dislocated. “I was in the corner, my left arm dangling. I put it on my knee and wiggled it back in the socket. It was still useless. I knew if I threw it again it would come out totally. The next four rounds I fought with one arm. I still won easily. But I had to get a [surgical] bone-block in my arm. When I woke up the pain was unbelievable. My right arm was so withered it took 10 months of hard work to get better.”
Ogogo won his next three fights before the bleak night against Cunningham. His love for boxing, somehow, endures. “I fell for boxing the moment I walked into the gym. The smells and the pictures of Muhammad Ali on the wall hooked me. I didn’t know whether I’d be any good but I would’ve been happy being a spit-bucket boy.”
'There have been some very dark moments. I went to the gym the first time after surgery and tried to punch the heavy bag. I missed it completely'
He was more than good enough to win his Olympic place ahead of Callum Smith, the unbeaten super-middleweight who could fight either George Groves or Chris Eubank Jr in the final of the World Boxing Super Series next summer. As Smith soars so Ogogo’s career has plummeted. Yet he remains resolute.
“I’ve said before, I don’t care if takes 10 eye surgeries, I’m going to box again. I’m now hoping the next one, the fourth one, is the last because I’ve got no money left. They will do the final fixing of the eye muscle when I’m awake so I can tell him what I’m seeing. After three weeks my brain will assimilate the new eye position and I should spar hopefully in January.
“My biggest dream is to win Sports Personality of the Year. I’ve been invited again this year but I’m not going because I’m not where I want to be in life. I think Joshua will win it next month. I’ll be happy for him because he’s a nice dude. I’m a few years behind him now but I still want to win it one day. That drives me on because I don’t want to be a bitter old man who didn’t achieve what he wanted. I’m more determined than ever to keep fighting.”


The Wales centre Jonathan Davies is set to be sidelined for around six months after suffering a foot injury. The Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) said “it is envisaged that recovery will be in the region of six months,” while also confirming that 65 times-capped Davies requires surgery.
The Scarlets player, who was hurt during a 29-21 loss to Australia three days ago, will miss Wales’ remaining autumn Tests against Georgia, New Zealand and South Africa, and also potentially the entire Six Nations.
“Jonathan Davies will undergo surgery to his foot following the injury sustained against Australia in the Under Armour Series,” the WRU said in a statement. “It is envisaged that recovery will be in the region of six months.”
It is a major blow for Wales and the Scarlets to lose Davies, who was British and Irish Lions player of the series against world champions New Zealand earlier this year. He went off during the dying seconds of Wales’ 13th successive defeat against the Wallabies, and looked in considerable discomfort.
Although the Wales head coach, Warren Gatland, is set to make several changes for next Saturday’s appointment with Georgia, Davies was an integral part of his autumn plans. New Zealand are Wales’ opponents on 25 November, and then South Africa seven days later. The 29-year-old missed the 2015 World Cup due to a knee ligament injury, but he has been in world-class form throughout this year.
Speaking to reporters on Monday, and before the full extent of Davies’ injury was announced, Wales’ assistant coach, Neil Jenkins, said: “It doesn’t look great. He is a world-class rugby player, there is no doubting that. Any team with someone like Jon involved is certainly going to miss him.
“He was outstanding in the summer for the Lions, for us and for the Scarlets at the end of the season. The sad thing is he’s been playing incredibly well, and it was right at the end of the game as well.”
Harlequins’ centre Jamie Roberts was called into Wales’ autumn Test squad as injury cover on Monday. Roberts, who has won 93 caps, missed out on a place in the original 36-man party announced by Gatland last month. But he is now on duty at Wales’ training base, along with another call-up in Cardiff Blues prop Scott Andrews, who is currently on loan with Premiership club Bath.
Roberts, 31, captained Wales in their summer Tests against Tonga earlier this year, and was a surprise omission from Gatland’s autumn squad.
Andrews provides cover with Scarlets tighthead Samson Lee continuing his progression from an achilles injury, while Exeter’s prop Tomas Francis is unavailable for Wales’ finale against South Africa as that game falls outside World Rugby’s autumn Test window.

Apocalypse, how? The Italian Football Federation’s president, Carlo Tavecchio, had defined the prospect of missing out on the 2018 World Cup as a disaster of biblical proportions. Now the worst has come to pass, the Azzurri failing to qualify for the first time in 60 years, after losing their play-off with Sweden. All that remains for a proud football nation is to analyse where it went wrong.
A partial answer could be found on the pitch at San Siro. Italy dominated Sweden with more than 75% of possession, yet lacked the subtlety to unpick a packed defence: pumping endless crosses into a penalty area where their opponents held a clear height advantage. A lack of nuance in the final third has been an ongoing problem for a team that has scored just three times in its last six competitive fixtures.
More revealing scenes, though, were playing out on the bench. Midway through the second half, a member of Italy’s coaching staff asked Daniele De Rossi to warm up. The midfielder reacted angrily, appearing to reply: “Why should I go on? We don’t need a draw, we need a win.”
His words were accompanied by a gesture in the direction of Lorenzo Insigne. De Rossi would later explain that he was making a broader point about the need for attackers, rather than seeking to single any individual out, yet many will wonder how the Napoli forward could be overlooked by manager Gian Piero Ventura.
Insigne is a man in the prime of his career, one who scored 18 league goals from the left wing for Napoli last season and almost reached double-digits for assists as well. He is the only Italian valued at over €100m by the CIES football observatory, and yet never made it on to the pitch on Monday – after making only the briefest of cameos in the first leg.
Nobody who has followed Ventura’s career could even be all that surprised. It is not that he underrates Insigne so much as that the manager is extraordinarily rigid in his selection process: a man fixated on square pegs and square holes. Insigne is a wide forward, and Italy were lined up in a 3-5-2. Therefore, there was no space available.
An inauspicious start to his tenure as his side are comprehensively second best in a friendly
A defence renowned for being tight is torn apart at the Bernabéu, with Isco scoring twice to leave Italy staring at the prospect of a play-off
Italy must win to have any chance of qualifying automatically but a lifeless display leads to the world's 85th best team equalising in the 77th minute, causing an eruption of booing at the final whistle in Turin
Italy lack invention and barely threaten the Sweden goal as a deflected Jakob Johansson strike is enough to leave Italy on the brink of missing out on Russia 2018
Italy have 75% of possession and 23 shots on goal but look predictable. With the score 0-0, they desperately need a goal but Ventura leaves the creative forward Lorenzo Insigne on the bench. The final whistle blows and Italy have lost 1-0 on aggregate. "Apocalypse, tragedy, catastrophe," says the Italian press
Ventura had sought to make room earlier in the qualifying campaign, sending his team out in a 4-2-4 and later a 3-4-3. The first formation was made to look wildly naive during a 3-0 thrashing by Spain in Madrid, while the latter yielded only a 1-1 draw at home to Macedonia.
It might actually have been player power that provoked a retreat, with veteran stars arranging a team meeting independent of the coaching staff after the latter result. Reports at the time suggested they were agitating for a return to the more familiar 3-5-2. That formation had been used to great effect by Antonio Conte at Euro 2016, but the truth is that all these numbers become meaningless without a coherent plan. Italy were fluid under the now Chelsea manager, a dynamic shape-shifting collective. Under Ventura, the connections between defence, midfield and attack have all but disappeared.
The fact that players felt compelled to meet without him might itself offer evidence – supplemented by De Rossi’s pitchside rebellion – of a lack of faith in his ability to lead them. Ventura’s coaching CV was always a modest one, when compared to his predecessors in the role. The biggest club he ever coached was Torino, whom he took to the Europa League in 2014.
In some sense, that was a part of his appeal. Prior to Euro 2016, Conte had always seemed restless as Italy manager – too young and too brilliant not to miss the week-to-week intensity of club football. Ventura was 68 when he took the job, and knew it was likely to be the greatest he ever held. He was perceived to have the right temperament to hang around and bring through the next generation of talent, and for a substantially lower salary, too.
That he was not up to this task, with hindsight, is clear. Italy’s talent pool has dwindled since their 2006 World Cup win and, despite the recent success of Atalanta with a squad founded on homegrown talent, investment in academy systems remains patchy. “In Spain the big clubs spend at least 10% of their enormous turnover on their youth teams,” noted one editorial in Tuesday’s Gazzetta dello Sport. “In Italy the most virtuous get to €10m.”
And yet Ventura had more to work with than Conte before him. The likes of Ciro Immobile and Andrea Belotti have blossomed at club level in the last 18 months. It is unforgiveable that Insigne’s club-mate Jorginho, a key pillar of the Napoli team leading Serie A, had not made his competitive debut for Italy before Monday.
Which is not to say that all blame should be placed on one man’s shoulders. Ventura will doubtless be removed from his post, his recent contract extension understood to contain a break clause covering this eventuality. Whether or not a similar fate awaits the men who appointed him remains to be seen.
Carlo Tavecchio’s presidency has been turbulent from the get-go: with many Italians outraged that he could win an election in the first place despite remarks about “banana eaters” flooding the league. There is a valid discussion to be had about whether a growing foreign presence – 53.3% of Serie A players hail from abroad, according to Transfermarket.com – has harmed the national team, but never on such grim racist terms.
Supporters of Tavecchio might argue that he has otherwise been a moderniser: playing his part in the introduction of video assistant referees in Serie A. Both Italy and Sweden might have had several penalties at San Siro had Fifa been similarly proactive.
It was telling, though, that the beaten team did not dwell on the latter point at full-time. No slow-motion replay could change the reality that they will not go to the World Cup next year.

Australia’s Kurtley Beale enjoyed posing in his swimming trunks alongside the Duke of Cambridge, but is now focused on dethroning England at Twickenham.
The 28-year-old back was preparing for an ice bath after the Wallabies’ 29-21 win over Wales last Saturday when the Duke, who is patron of the Welsh Rugby Union, entered the changing rooms to congratulate the visitors.
Beale seized the photo opportunity and shared the image with his 66,000 Instagram followers alongside the caption: “When you rock up to the party feeling a little over dressed.” The basketball star Shaquille O’Neal then doctored the photo with his own face to share with his 6.5m Instagram followers, sending the image viral.
As preparations began for Saturday’s Test against England, Beale said: “I didn’t really realise how much it was going to take off. It’s a bit of a surprise for me. It was pretty lucky. He [the Duke] came in the sheds and said g’day to the boys, which was pretty cool.
“I just came from the recovery room. I recover in ice baths. I love playing in my budgie smugglers, so they were the last things that I was wearing.
“I just happened to be taking it easy and it was pretty good to have a yarn with him in the sheds. I asked him if he wanted my ones that I had on. I’m sure we’ll be able to organise a pair if he wanted some for Christmas. It’s always special when you meet royalty.”
Prince Harry, the Duke’s brother, is patron of the Rugby Football Union and likely to be in the stands at Twickenham, but Beale’s focus on Saturday will be on the pitch.
The Wallabies beat England at Twickenham in the 2015 World Cup, but have lost their past four matches to Saturday’s hosts. Beale missed all of those Tests in 2016 with a knee injury, but even his stint in England with Wasps has not changed his appraisal of the hosts’ approach.
“In the Premiership there is a huge focus around going forwards and being physical up front to lay that platform for your backs,” Beale added. “England have always had that dominant forward pack and they’re pretty smart and creative around that set-piece. We’ve definitely got the work cut out for ourselves. It’s something we’ll be working really hard to try to nullify.”
Eddie Jones’s England have lost only once in 21 matches – against Ireland in March – and are unbeaten at Twickenham during that time. However, they are under no illusions that it will take a far better performance than last Saturday’s against Argentina when Australia are in opposition.
Australia are on a high following the win over Wales – their 13th in a row – and October’s Bledisloe Cup defeat of New Zealand, plus a win in Japan.
There is much talk of England building for the 2019 Rugby World Cup in Japan, but that is Australia’s aim, too. Beale added: “It’s exciting times for us, as a playing group, a young group. Coming up against a pretty good English team is going to be a great test for us. I’m really enjoying the role I have at the moment. It’s a bit of a roving role and I’ll play wherever the coaches see fit and think I play my best rugby, whatever’s the best for the team.
“As a backline we all have a good understanding of what is required in certain positions. Sometimes out in the field you might have to fill in for someone else and it’s great we have that understanding of each other.”
Meanwhile, Glen Ella, who was a skills coach for England during their tour of Australia last year, believes Jones, the England coach, will be more concerned if Beale is moved from full-back to inside centre at Twickenham.
With Beale and Matt Toomua out injured, the Wallabies picked the bulldozing Samu Kerevi and Tevita Kuridrani in the opening two Tests of last year’s three-match series in Australia and in the weekend victory over Wales.
Ella, who played with Jones at Randwick in the 1980s, told foxsports.com.au: “When Kurtley’s playing at 12 he opens up the space for others out wide. The option of having two big guys in the centre of the field – they might run over people – but they don’t pass it too often. That would suit Eddie. But if you’ve got Kurtley there who can run, do whatever he wants, that’s going to worry him more.”


Phil Jones is hopeful of recovering from the calf injury he suffered playing for England and being available for Manchester United’s game against Newcastle United on Saturday evening.
The central defender was withdrawn by Gareth Southgate during Friday’s 0-0 draw with Germany after just 25 minutes, after what the manager indicated was a recurrence of the same problem that caused his substitution in United’s defeat at Huddersfield Town last month.
After leaving the England squad on Monday, tests with United’s medical department has left Jones optimistic he can face Rafael Benítez’s side at Old Trafford.
Jones has established himself as first-choice under José Mourinho, and if the 25-year-old can play it will be a major boost for the manager, with United having lost their last game before the international break, 1-0 at Chelsea. The defeat left the Portuguese’s team eight points behind Manchester City, who are yet to lose, after 11 matches. The Manchester rivals meet at Old Trafford on 10 December.


Australia and Denmark are the latest countries to book their places at the World Cup next summer, but a few titans of the game will not be in attendance. Four-times champions Italy are missing out for the first time since 1958; three-times finalists Holland finished third at the last World Cup but only finished third in their qualifying group this time around; and Chile, who are ranked ninth in the world, will be staying at home.
The list of the 32 countries going to the World Cup is almost complete, so why is your team missing? Did you have high hopes going into the qualifying campaign or was it always going to be a struggle? Was there a turning point in the qualifiers where everything turned against your side or has it been a total disaster from start to finish? Share your thoughts by filling out the form below and we’ll publish some of your responses by the end of the week.


England remain a “big team” who have a chance of winning the World Cup with their combination of technical and physical attributes, according to the coach of Brazil.
Speaking in a stadium he described as a “temple” of football, Tite talked up his opponent on the eve of the latest glamour friendly at Wembley.
While such conduct is perhaps to be expected of a polite guest, the Brazilian genuinely enthused about the host country. He praised the qualities of Harry Kane, Dele Alli and even Gary Cahill. He pointed to the strength in depth of the national team and the diverse challenges of the Premier League. He even quoted the thoughts of Sir Alex Ferguson, though this may have been a faux pas. While a luminary of English football, Fergie is not quite an Englishman.
“All the big teams, like England, have this new generation coming through. Even though [Gareth] Southgate has only had 13 games so far they have Dele Alli, Kane and the experience of Cahill. Alli and Kane are not playing against us, but instead there will be Marcus Rashford and Jamie Vardy. The level is strong.
“They have got tradition which carries weight, so I see England as one of the favourites. And I’m not just saying that because I’m here at Wembley speaking in front of English people,” he added.
England will be Brazil’s first European opposition since they completed their World Cup qualification. The Seleção sealed their place in impressive style, losing only once in 18 games and scoring 41 goals in the process, but Tite played down the suggestion that this match would mean a shift in styles. “It’s not about facing European opposition,” he said. “It’s about facing an English team that is technical and physical in what is almost a heritage site of world football. Like the Maracaña it is a temple and if the players are to do their job they will have to bring their best performance. It is my job to help the players do that.”
Tite continued to talk positively about Kane, comparing him to his own talisman, Gabriel Jesus. “Kane is a penalty box player with an impressive finishing ability. He’s good in the air, good with his right foot and left. It’s very impressive, he has a lot of quality.
“On Gabriel Jesus I’ll say here what I said in Brazil. That [Manchester] City, who are the team that signed him, should be very pleased with Palmeiras and the coaches there who formed a player who is already at such a good level. To the point which he came here with a natural fluency, I already mentioned the mental capacity he has and his technical ability. He didn’t need much time to adapt, he was already showing a very good level.
“The characteristics of Gabriel Jesus and Kane are a bit different. Gabriel attacks the space, gives us that depth, Kane is more positional. They’re two strong strikers.”
Perhaps the question of stylistic difference has narrowed as European leagues have become more multicultural. Tite’s starting XI is likely to feature two Premier League players in Jesus and Philippe Coutinho, with Fernandinho, Willian, Roberto Firmino and Ederson all available from the bench. The coach said the influence of imports has meant that the English style of football has developed in recent years.
“The English style is a mixture of playing styles, especially now,” he said. “We’re seeing more football on the floor, more triangles. In the Premier League so many players have been brought in and they bring their different styles of play with them. That makes the league very strong and interesting to watch.”
Tite has been described in Brazil as more of a European-style coach because of his willingness to build a team from strong defensive foundations. He insisted, however, that he is not a dogmatist but a pragmatist, and claimed a former Manchester United manager was of the same mind.
“Firstly, what I like to do is analyse performance not the result. As Sir Alex Ferguson wrote in one of his books, I believe, I try to control the variables. If we can do that then we can gain good results. You can play well and lose or you can play badly and win. These big teams know how to play in different styles and I count England in that. We’re going to go out and do our best to be us tomorrow.”


“Italy, this is the apocalypse,” was the headline in the country’s leading sports paper La Gazzetta dello Sport on Tuesday morning, perhaps an understandable reaction for a nation whose passion for football is so great that the same publication concluded that “a love so great must be reserved for other things [than the World Cup]”.
Put in context the facts make stark reading. Italy’s abject failure in front of goal against Sweden, who held the Azzurri to a 0-0 draw in the San Siro stadium, meant the hosts lost 1-0 on aggregate and failed to qualify for the tournament for the first time in 60 years, when in 1958 the finals were, appropriately, hosted by the team who halted their progress on Monday.

The final whistle blows and Italy have lost 1-0 on aggregate. "Apocalypse, tragedy, catastrophe," says the Italian press
Uruguay were the previous World Cup winners who failed to advance to the finals in 2006, but prior to that statisticians had to go back to 1994 when England and France were knocked out during qualification and before that another 20 years back to Spain in 1974.
La Gazzetta blamed “opportunities missed”. The paper’s editorial read: “We will not be with you and you will not be with us. Italy will not participate at the World Cup. There will be inevitable consequences.” Inevitably that will mean the departure of widely criticised head coach Gian Piero Ventura, who initially was mistakenly reported to have quit in the immediate aftermath of the match.
La Gazzetta were in no doubt: “Ventura, now it’s over,” identifying Carlo Ancelotti as one potential successor. The Italian is currently out of work after leaving Bayern Munich. “Whoever comes in will have to rebuild from rubble and work towards Euro 2020,” read the article. “The most fancied name is Ancelotti but there is the possibility [Chelsea manager Antonio] Conte will return, as he is a bit tired of England.
“Very welcome alternatives would be [Roberto] Mancini and [Massimiliano] Allegri, if they can leave their respective roles at Zenit St Petersburg and Juventus.”
The front page of the other major sports daily, Corriere dello Sport, read simply: “Italy out of the World Cup”, stating how painful it will be for the country to be on the sidelines when the finals are under way in Russia next June.
“In only a few months’ time we will be watching the World Cup for everyone else: for the first time in 60 years we will be on the outside,” the newspaper commented in an editorial piece. “It is an intolerable football shame, an indelible stain.”
The online headline in the Italian broadsheet La Repubblica read simply: “Goodbye Russia”, while Turin’s La Stampa proclaimed: “Disaster for Italy, we won’t be going to the World Cup.”


It was the kind of moment Gareth Southgate must have envisaged when the idea to call up two players from England’s Under-20 World Cup-winning side was discussed in the aftermath of Friday’s encouraging draw with Germany.
With eight players including Harry Kane and Jordan Henderson having already pulled out of Tuesday’s friendly with Brazil, the addition of Lewis Cook of Bournemouth and Liverpool’s Dominic Solanke was an indication of the kind of long-term planning that is quickly becoming Southgate’s hallmark.
“The first afternoon I saw Lewis just sat having lunch with Joe Hart and Gary Cahill,” the manager said. “It’s a very easy squad to settle into. The senior players are very open, very welcoming. Most of the squad are young anyway and know each other from younger age groups. And so those guys have fitted in off the field no problem, which helps them fit in on the field. And they’re good players. In training, they look fine.”
Whether either Cook or Solanke, whose Premier League experience amounts to only 85 minutes from seven substitute appearances since his move to Anfield in the summer, will be thrown into the deep end against Neymar and co remains to be seen. But after a year that has seen England enjoy unprecedented success at youth level, the gauntlet for future generations has clearly been thrown down a little more than six months before the senior side depart for the World Cup in Russia.
Even the prospect of playing the team Southgate described as “the best in the world” has clearly not persuaded him to veer from his charted course, with Eric Dier to captain a team expected to be brimming with youth once more. “We have to see how the game progresses but I wouldn’t have any hesitation about putting them on the pitch,” he said in reference to Cook, Solanke and the goalkeeper Angus Gunn, who is on loan at Norwich from Manchester City.
“Angus has worked with us in the under-21s, he’s playing in the league. The other two are the captain of the under-20s’ World Cup winners, and the golden boot winner in the under-20s’ World Cup, so they’ve got good pedigree.
“We won’t hesitate to put them on the pitch. The message is that there is opportunity. We want some of these youngsters who have good international pedigree already to have a pathway.”
After handing debuts to all three new faces in his squad against Germany, you have to take Southgate at his word. It must be said a lack of viable alternatives have forced his hand somewhat given that less than a third of all appearances in the Premier League this season have been made by players qualified for England. The admission he had seen more in one game from Joe Gomez, the man of the match Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Tammy Abraham “than you might see in many more from other players” was a warning there is to be no turning back now.
Cook, who came through the youth system at Leeds before moving to Bournemouth last year, is a case in point. He has represented England at every age group from under-16 upwards and was also part of the under-17 squad who won the European Championship in 2014. “I think every international game you play is a great learning curve,” Cook said.
“We play these teams with different styles of play and it boosts your knowledge about the game itself. We are trying to get to the stage that you are playing similar to the first team and everyone is playing well. You have to try your hardest to get there and have a good relationship with the players on and off the pitch.”
As far as records go against the country who have won more World Cups than any other, England’s most recent encounters with Brazil could offer similar encouragement. A 2-1 victory at Wembley thanks to goals from Wayne Rooney and Frank Lampard in February 2013 and the 2-2 draw in Rio four months later, both under Roy Hodgson, appeared to provide evidence that progress was being made before the last tournament, only for it all to end spectacularly after only two group stage games at Brazil 2014.
Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain scored England’s first goal in that friendly at the Maracanã but is now outside the squad, having failed to establish himself for club or country. His experiences should provide a warning for the emerging young players, although Southgate clearly has complete faith they will be different if they are given an opportunity.
“With this particular group, if they didn’t do so well the fall isn’t so far because they are young,” he said. “They’ll learn quickly from it. We know for one or two it’s a bit too early but the experience is invaluable and some of the messaging around is: ‘OK, this is where you are, you’ve played against two of the best in the world but what’s next? What do you need to go away an work on?’ Maybe if that’s an older player, 26 or 27, and it doesn’t happen that’s a little bit more difficult because opportunity to improve is a bit different.
“So I think it does help knowing the individuals. Also you have a closer relationship because you’ve worked with them so there’s a bit more security when they are coming into the group, a bit more comfort, which allows them to relax on the field a bit more.”
After the experiences of the last two major tournaments, that can only be a welcome prospect.


A few weeks ago, it felt like the Boston Celtics’ season had ended before it had begun. Gordon Hayward, the team’s prime free-agent acquisition over the summer, suffered a season-ending ankle injury just a few minutes into the NBA’s opening night. Unsurprisingly, Boston went on to lose to the Cleveland Cavaliers, despite a valiant comeback attempt, and then fall to the Milwaukee Bucks the very next night.
And then, somehow, the Celtics became unbeatable. With their 94-95 win over the Toronto Raptors on Sunday, the Celtics improved their winning streak to 12 straight games, something the team hadn’t accomplished since the 2008-09 season, back during the peak era of the New Big Three era. At 12-2, the Celtics have the best record of the young NBA season. More impressively, they have managed to put together this streak despite the fact that both Kyrie Irving and Al Horford have had to miss games due to on-the-court injuries.
The Celtics’ early success is even more baffling because one would expect a young team to be work through growing pains. This team features a radically different roster from those of the past few Celtics seasons. Most notably, they traded Isaiah Thomas, their best player in the last few seasons, to the Cavaliers for Irving, while Avery Bradley, their longest tenured player at the time, was sent to the Detroit Pistons in order to free up room to bring in Hayward.
It’s hard not to credit head coach Brad Stevens for how well these Celtics seem to play together. Since replacing Doc Rivers in 2013, he has shown a knack for putting his players in the best possible position to win, and his teams have consistently out-performed expectations. Under his watch, the Celtics have established themselves as the best defensive team in the NBA, which has allowed them to stay in games despite the fact they don’t have the offensive firepower that they thought they would.
If you had to pick Stevens’s signature game with the Celtics, you could do worse than look at Friday’s game against the Charlotte Hornets where Boston rallied to come back from an 18-point deficit without Irving, Holford or Hayward. Under his watch, the Celtics have established themselves as the best defensive team in the NBA, which has allowed them to stay in games despite the fact they don’t have the offensive firepower that they thought they would.
GM Danny Ainge also deserves some credit here. It’s far too early to evaluate off-season moves, particularly when it comes to teams focused on winning in the near-future rather than an immediate championship. Still, at the moment, Ainge’s two most contentious moves are paying early dividends. Many fans were skeptical when they traded their first-round pick to the Philadelphia 76ers, passing over sure-thing Markelle Fultz in order to select Jayson Tatum. As of right now, Tatum might be the (ridiculously early) frontrunner for rookie of the year while Fultz has already been sidelined with an injury. (The moral, as always, is never get drafted by Philadelphia).
Obviously, the Celtics’ most controversial move was the Irving trade, where they jettisoned fan-favorite Thomas for a player who had been publicly trying to force his way out of Cleveland. By all accounts, Irving wanted to escape from LeBron James’s shadow and establish himself as the star player on a championship-contending team. Well, he got his wish almost immediately after Hayward’s injury. Before suffering a facial fracture last Sunday, Irving was working his way into the MVP conversation, making clutch shots and even establishing himself as a leader, something he was unable to do during those first few LeBron-free seasons in Cleveland.
Fittingly enough, the Celtics’ success appears to be happening at the expense of Irving’s old team. The Cavaliers are struggling in a way that feels a little bit different than their usual “sleepwalk through parts of the regular season, then flip the switch during the playoffs” routine of seasons past. The Cavaliers have struggled to get over .500 for most of the early season (only a late blitz against the Knicks on Monday night got them to a 7-7 record). While Boston currently has the best defense in the league, Cleveland has featured the worst. While Irving has been helping the Celtics close out games, Thomas may not be cleared to play until January. While the Celtics are seeing contributions from a wide range of young players, the Cavaliers are attempting to squeeze out minutes from the likes of Iman Shumpert and the ghost of Derrick Rose.
Now, we’re only midway through November, so there’s a good chance that Boston’s fortunes could change. The Celtics are clearly a talented team but they are also playing above themselves; a regression to the mean is all but inevitable. It’s also hard to imagine that the Cavaliers won’t improve in time for the postseason, especially if Thomas returns and is anything close to the player he was in Boston. However, considering how dangerous this Celtics team have looked without Hayward, the Cavaliers, and the rest of the Eastern Conference, should start worrying how good this team could be when he returns.


Which is worse: being stuck in limbo or being stuck at Arsenal? It’s hard to say for sure but we can all agree that they are both pretty terrible. So spare a thought for Mesut Özil, who has been living that twin hell for some time now. Happily for the Germany midfielder, salvation may be on its way with news that Atlético Madrid are interested in acquiring his talents.
The Spanish club have reportedly contacted Özil over a possible move in the summer, when his contract expires and he can finally rid himself of those long think-pieces focusing on whether or not he’s actually any good. Atlético are thought to be willing to offer Özil a salary of £200,000 a week, alongside a hefty signing-on fee, and should the 29-year-old say “si”, it would bring a return to Madrid following his three-year spell at Real prior to joining Arsenal in September 2013.
One player who could be making a sortofnotreallybutwe’vestartedsowe’llfinish opposite move is Saúl Ñíguez. Manchester United are supposedly keen on signing Atlético’s attacking midfielder as cover for Paul Pogba. The Frenchman has been out of action since mid-September with a hamstring injury and, while bravely refusing to cry about it, José Mourinho has reportedly decided he needs to bring in another body if United are to maintain their twin assault on the Premier League and Champions League. Saúl fits the bill, with Mourinho a long-term admirer of the 22-year-old Spanish tyro.
Another man who could be on his way to Old Trafford in January is the Argentinian left-back Enzo Diaz. The 21-year-old plays for the second division leaders Agropecuario and has impressed United’s scouts, with the player keen for a deal to happen. “It is the dream of any footballer to play for Manchester United,” Diaz told local hacks. “However, I need to remain focused on what we are doing and enjoying this moment.” Wise words Enzo, wise words.
Elsewhere, Liverpool are keen on re-signing Suso from Milan should Philippe Coutinho join Barcelona in January. Brendan Rodgers fans will remember that Suso played under the Northern Irishman during his time in charge at Anfield and impressed on occasions having come through the club’s academy. However, he was deemed not quite good enough and subsequently sold in 2015. Since then, the Spaniard has shone and could now be heading back – but only if Coutinho jumps ship early and Liverpool are prepared to pay Suso’s buyout clause, which is said to be in the £35m region.
Staying with Liverpool and it appears Danny Ings’s time there is coming to an end. The striker has been linked with a loan move to West Ham in January, having struggled to make an impact on Merseyside due to a combination of terrible injury luck and other strikers being ahead of him in the pecking order. David Moyes was reportedly keen on signing Ings during his time at Real Sociedad and could make the 25-year-old his first acquisition now he has replaced Slaven Bilic.
The bad news for Ings should he decide to join West Ham is that he may not get the chance to play alongside Arthur Masuaku. The left-back, who joined from Olympiacos for £6.2m in August 2016, is wanted by Napoli, Juventus, Milan and Genoa, and is keen on joining at least one of them in the new year, according to the 24-year-old’s agent, Francesco Lingenti. Speaking to CalcioNapoli24.it, he is reported as saying: “Serie A is our objective and hopefully he [Masuaku] will be there in January. However, he’d only go to Juventus if they sold Alex Sandro.”
And finally, Brighton and Southampton are both interested in signing Aleksandar Mitrovic. The Serbia striker is struggling to get a game under Rafael Benítez at Newcastle United and could now be on the verge of moving from one end of the country to another.


In May a team of former professional footballers set off to take part in the Hong Kong Soccer Sevens. All had played in the English top flight, with David James, Des Walker, Phil Babb, Mikaël Silvestre and Colin Hendry among their number.
“I didn’t really know many of them,” says Kevin Gallen, who was a last-minute addition to the squad. “I’d played against some of them, and there were others I had looked up to when I was a young player. The first day we got there we went for a little training, and it was like rolling back six years to when I was playing, training and having a laugh. That’s what I enjoyed mostly about the trip, just having a laugh with the lads.”
They had been brought together by Playon Pro, a company launched in September by the former Nottingham Forest, Manchester United and England defender Viv Anderson. Its primary goals are “helping players transition into retirement” and creating “an outlet to help players continue to play with their ex-team-mates, and retain the camaraderie and the dressing-room banter”. Plus, perhaps of equal importance, to earn some money.
Xpro, a charity created in 2011 to assist former professionals, estimates that two in five players will experience serious financial difficulties within five years of retirement, and that a third will have separated from their partner within a year of hanging up their boots.
“Players earning £40,000 a week, they will be bankrupt within five years of retiring,” Anderson says. “You’ve got houses and cars and holidays – you still want to live the lifestyle. If somebody gives a footballer £100, they’ll spend £101. We’ve all fallen into that trap. And when you get to 35 or 36, unless you’re a Beckham or a Gerrard, your agent is on to the next shiny thing. Thank you very much for the last 20 years, goodbye. The clubs are going: ‘We’ve paid you £40,000 a week, you can look after yourself.’ So that’s gone. And you’re sat there thinking: ‘Who else is there to look after me?’ There’s no one. It’s only you.”
Changes to the age at which players can access their pensions have also hit hard. In 2002 the government scrapped a rule that allowed sportspeople to collect private pensions at the age of 35; since 2010 they have had to wait until they reach 55. That age is scheduled to keep rising – those playing now will have to wait until they are at least 59.
Players earning £40,000 a week will be bankrupt within five years of retiring
“I got my pension at 35 but now if you finish then you’ve got this 20-year gap,” Anderson says. “And you’re left thinking: ‘Well I’ve lived this lifestyle now, and I’m waiting for this big chunk of money to come in, but I’ve got another 20 years. So I’ve got to do something, I’ve got to get a job.’”
So far some 150 former sportspeople have signed up to Playon Pro, receiving access to an app to communicate with each other, offers from selected retailers, and information about potential work. Playon Pro is not a charity: it arranges for high-profile sportspeople to attend events or play in one-off matches or tournaments anywhere in the world, takes a cut of the fee involved and passes the rest on to the players. It does not only work with footballers but is open to those who have reached the pinnacle of their sport.
“No disrespect to someone at Yeovil but people want players they’ve seen on the television,” Anderson says. “We give players a place to go, to chat among themselves, maybe get job opportunities and to extend their circle of friends and keep busy. That hopefully keeps them going until they are 55 and can get their pension.”
At 42, Gallen has some way to go before he reaches that point. Having retired soon after being released by Luton in 2011, he found it difficult to adjust. “Looking back now, maybe I could have squeezed out another year,” he says. “It’s pretty difficult when you’re walking down the stairs and your knees, your back and your ankles are cracking.
“One of the reasons why I didn’t play on is because I started coaching full-time at QPR with the youth team, which I loved. Then a new manager came in and brought new people with him,and I got let go. That was pretty hard to take. When you play for a club for 13 or 14 years, support the club and it’s close to your heart and they just wash their hands of you, that’s pretty hard. It was harder than retirement to be honest.”
There's a saying: no friends in football, just acquaintances. I understand that now
Gallen has avoided many of the pitfalls facing the recently retired footballer. He remains married and has a healthy pension to look forward to – thanks mainly to the sage financial advice of Ray Wilkins when Gallen was a youngster at QPR – but has lost “the camaraderie, the socialising, and the great laugh” he enjoyed in his career, having fallen out of touch with most of the people he shared those moments with.
“I’ve got about seven people, maybe 10, from my career who I still speak to,” he says. “Considering I must have played with hundreds, it’s not great is it? That’s what happens in football – when you leave a club you only keep in contact with one or two. There’s a saying: ‘There’s no friends in football, just acquaintances.’ I used to hear people saying that when I was a kid and I thought: ‘What are they talking about?’ Now I understand.”
This is where Playon Pro comes in. Anderson sees a future where players can go straight from the professional game into an established circuit of tours and tournaments. “They do it with golf, they do it with tennis, they do it with individual sports, but nobody’s ever done it with football,” he says.
“I think that’s where we should be heading. Because there’s only a certain amount of jobs – managing, coaching, jobs on Sky or wherever. The majority of ex-players are scrabbling around for this, that and the other, just trying to make a living. All we’re trying to give them is somewhere to go. It could be classed as their last club.”


After making his only major error of the season with a crash in qualifying at the Brazilian Grand Prix, Lewis Hamilton said he wanted to redeem himself in the race. Finishing in fourth place after starting from the pit lane was better than he expected. It was a performance acknowledged by the Mercedes executive director, Toto Wolff, who said: “It was the best fourth place I’ve ever seen. If you consider starting from the pit lane and ending up 5.4 seconds behind the leader, it’s quite an astonishing drive.” In doing so, Hamilton performed pass after pass. Many were perfunctory given his car’s advantage, but his reactions in dealing with Sergio Pérez’s spirited defence into turn one were indicative of a driver at the top of his game. He had wanted to end the season strongly with two wins, a goal that was beyond him after qualifying. That he chose to still hurl himself at the race, attempting to chase down third place right to the flag shows how hungry he is – a far cry from when he lost focus after taking the title in 2015. With his eye now on next season and the race win beyond him, the charge to fourth was the best statement of intent he could make.
Sebastian Vettel drove a consummate race to take a much-deserved win and Ferrari will be pleased with finally returning to the top step for the first time since round 11 in Hungary. The title was gone but the Scuderia were eager for a strong finish to the season. They finally delivered and showed they could have taken this to the wire but for the races in Singapore, Malaysia and Japan that cost them dear. Vettel admitted it was a “great relief” and the team principal, Maurizio Arrivabene, believed it was validation of their development. “On Sunday, we got the confirmation that we have a very good car at our disposal,” he said. Reasons to be optimistic for 2018 then but with caution. The new Mercedes engine used by Hamilton and turned up to No11, was ominously strong. Hamilton was a second a lap quicker at some points and Vettel admitted that while his car was strong through the corners it was still losing on the straights at Interlagos. The Mercedes did, however, reveal again that it does not enjoy following cars – Hamilton’s charge overworking its tyres. Ferrari have proved they have the chassis to beat, now they need an engine to match.
Having taken pole with a fine lap, Valtteri Bottas was optimistic that he could turn his lacklustre second half of the season around in Brazil. He failed to do so. Vettel beat him off the line to take the lead through turn one – and with the pace of the cars so similar it was enough to virtually decide the race. The Finn said he had wheelspin at the start but Vettel too did not have the perfect getaway. With his nose in front the German opted to go up the inside. But his move was not complete – with Bottas being on the outside he could have held his line and attempted to fight it out, taking the inside of turn two of the Senna S. However he chose to concede and move in behind Vettel. A decision unlikely from Hamilton, Max Verstappen or Daniel Ricciardo for example. It was hugely costly. During the race his lap times were within three to four hundredths of a second of Vettel throughout but the place had gone. He has admitted that opening-lap decisiveness has been a weakness and it is one he must address, as Niki Lauda noted drily, Bottas “deserved his second place”.
The season is not yet over but already concerns for what the racing might promise next year are rightly being aired. There was passing aplenty at Interlagos but in cars of widely different pace. Where they were closely matched, the ascendancy of aero influence in the new regulations was proving again that passing where there is no high speed differential will be difficult. Verstappen noted while chasing Kimi Raikkonen that: “I am faster but I am stuck being behind.” It is not the first time a driver has expressed such frustration, a problem that may be compounded when F1 moves to using only three engines in 2018. “I don’t like the idea of going to three. That sucks,” said Hamilton. “Sprinting is what we are missing in F1.” He was concerned too that the cars becoming heavier with the addition of Halo would make for a poor combination. “The car is going to be a bus next year, it is going to be so heavy, like a Nascar,” he added. “I know it sounds negative but as a racer we want fast, nimble cars where we can attack always every single lap. If you look at the front guys, they were managing and that is what we are normally doing. I don’t think that is too exciting for people to watch. I’m not sure cutting down engines is helping it in that direction.”
There is no doubt the Autódromo José Carlos Pace is a marvellous circuit and drivers enjoy the challenge but this year there was considerable unease at the danger presented by racing in São Paulo. There were five incidents over the weekend involving gunpoint robbery. Mercedes mechanics in a minibus had valuables stolen by armed thieves on Friday. And FIA officials and Williams staff also suffered attempted robberies the same evening. On Saturday Sauber crew were the victims and on Sunday Pirelli staff. The FIA had worked with the local authorities promising “heavy police reinforcements” but that the incidents continued throughout the weekend was not a good indication that it had any effect. There was general agreement of wanting to continue racing at Interlagos but danger signs for the circuit as well, particularly now McLaren have cancelled a scheduled test this week. With the owners the Formula One Group looking at a variety of new venues, a spokesman warned of questions over whether they should host races in cities “with difficulties like that”. The São Paulo mayor, João Doria, said: “I’ve seen worse cases at other race tracks”, although it is hard to imagine quite where he means.


Double centuries creep up on you. The first hundred, and you think the player is done. They often feel the same, hence Mark Waugh’s career. From 70 to 100 is a gulf, 100 to 130 is an addendum. The 150 milestone feels kind of token. OK, I’ll clap. Then in the upper 170s, you abruptly realise – wait. This is on.
So it was with Ellyse Perry last weekend at North Sydney Oval. It had been all patience, no alarms. Then wickets began to fall, the ninth with her on 192. Tension ratcheted up. Megan Schutt hung in. On 194, everyone visited the fence bar midwicket. Perry went over her, celebrating as the crowd called six. The umpires called four. Groans. Nerves. Try again. A drive dead straight down the ground. Four.
The internet blew up. Perry trended worldwide. The crowd of nearly 4,000 – unprecedented for a women’s Test – roared its approval on every replay. Recurring were various questions, rhetorical and otherwise: how good is this? Why don’t we see it more often? Why isn’t it on TV? Backlit starkly by this glow was one uncomfortable fact: Australia’s next Test will likely be in August 2019.
If you enjoyed the innings, you can thank Clare Connor. On partisan lines, England’s former captain and current director of women’s cricket would have preferred to see Perry dismissed. But without Connor, no one would be playing women’s Test cricket at all.
“If we’re looking at the facts of the matter, it doesn’t really exist,” she said flatly in our October interview. “I played in a three-match Test series in 1998 in England which was an amazing experience.” But three games became two, then one. “It had become tokenistic and… it didn’t have enough meaning, almost, for us to defend its position. With the multi-format Ashes, we’ve created something the players love and which you can build a narrative around.”
The multi-format series was Connor’s idea, and apparently a hard sell. A two-Test version was discarded, with Cricket Australia eventually agreeing to the current model for 2013-14. “So we’re in survival mode, aren’t we, with England-Australia, and we’ve found something that just about keeps it in some form for now. But I could imagine that’s going to be constantly challenged.”
Perry’s moment brought a rush of enthusiasm. But that’s risky thinking. If you valorise a format based on a good day, you condemn it for a bad one. England blocking out a draw on a pitch as ferocious as a sea-monkey invasion was no advertisement. But the why for women’s Test cricket doesn’t rely on every game being a classic. It’s simple. Women are now professional cricketers, and Tests are still acknowledged as the prime format for proving skill.
Those against the format have a simple argument too. Test matches cost money. Running four or five days at a ground is more expensive than one. Women’s cricket has the potential to become profitable, but the shorter formats are easier to market to fans and sell for broadcast. Multi-day cricket is viewed as a costly interruption.
But this isn’t a women’s sport issue. Men’s Tests are also subsidised. Australia banks losses unless hosting England or India, because broadcast rights don’t cover costs. Boards are happy to squeeze tours down to two-Test afterthoughts, avoid smaller nations for years on end, and campaign to cut the fifth day. Resistance comes because Tests are broadly respected. There’s an understanding that they matter. If that’s the case, blocking one gender from participating is ethically unjustifiable.
In any case, financial arguments are short-sighted. Yes, we live in an era with independent T20 stars, but they remain the exception. Most of the big names in coloured clothes are those who’ve already proved themselves in whites. The longest format costs money, but invests credibility. It was a Test double-hundred that got Ben Stokes a record IPL contract; and Perry’s equivalent has boosted a celebrated player yet another level.
As far as women’s Tests being unsaleable, what we saw at North Sydney Oval turned that on its head: 12,600 came through the gate; ABC Grandstand broadcasted on its analogue network; the Guardian’s over-by-over liveblogs for the Test attracted more than 200,000 page views. Presented right, the appetite was there. Surely that offers the potential for income.
The key is a quality product. This is where the future will be made or broken. Point one: flat old pitches don’t allow strokeplay or threaten wickets. Point two: no one can improve if they don’t play. With one Test every two years for the lucky teams, and none for the rest, players are set up to fail. They are scrutinised for performance and saddled with career stats in a format they learn on the job. More Tests are a start – surely every tour should at use the multi-format model. But there also needs to be practice, at state level and below.
Do that, and we’ll stop seeing nervous players blocking out their first 50 balls for fear of wasting a biennial opportunity. Or, to move past the focus on scoring rates, we’ll develop the vastly different bowling required. Sixty dot balls in an ODI makes you a genius; in a Test it makes you tired. It takes years to hone a method of long-form attack. Most tellingly, you’ll see investment on the field. Every player who spoke to the media around the Ashes Test said they want to play more. They value it, relish it, look forward to it. Given the chance, they’ll deliver.
I watch cricket to see the best players tested in the most rigorous environment. A T20 innings is a dancefloor banger, not a magnum opus. It’s an excerpt of Tchaikovsky with the cannons isolated in the mix. The rest of the orchestra remains unheard.
In Test cricket, other parts come to the fore. The relationship of lead violin to second, the duelling timpani, percussionists barely noticed in support, glockenspiel punctuating the whole with bright shafts of sound. Having found the best female players in the world, we stop them from contributing to the symphony. With each passing month of the professional era, this makes less sense. There must be a future for women’s Test cricket. We want to see what they can do.


Rafael Nadal, who surprised even himself by ending the season No1 in the world, finished it down and out in Paris and London, calling it quits for 2017 on Monday night after losing against David Goffin in his first match of the ATP World Tour Finals.
His wounded knee gave up on him after two matches in Bercy last week and on the banks of the Thames it collapsed again under his vigorous hitting, as Goffin cashed in after blowing four match points to win 7-6 (5), 6-7 (4), 6-4 in two hours and 36 minutes. This end-of-season title is the only significant bauble in the game to elude Nadal and, at 31, he might go through his trophy-heavy career regarding it as his personal hell. “I am off,” he said matter-of-factly.
“My season is finished. I had the commitment with the event, with the city, with myself. I tried hard. It is about the pain. I cannot hold with enough power to keep playing. It was a miracle to be even close to the score.”
The clay-courter supreme has invariably travelled here in trepidation, having withdrawn five times in 13 visits, losing twice in finals, and again the Spaniard’s suspicions about the rigours of the indoor hardcourt were confirmed. As for the future and his prospects of making it to the line for the Australian Open in January, Nadal said: “I know what I have to do. I know the periods of time that I need to work. If the treatment works or not, we will see. The good thing is it is nothing new. Everybody on my team has the right experience [to deal with the injury]. We hope to manage it, to have the right rest, the right work, and to try to be ready for the beginning of the next season.”
He did well to avoid going 1-5 down in the third, but there was only so much fight he could offer. His compatriot Pablo Carreño Busta is waiting in the wings as the first alternate.
Goffin was by turn heroic and profligate, as was the Spaniard – but it was the Belgian who held it together for the best result of his career. “It was a tough fight,” Goffin said. “Rafa is such a big fighter, one of the strongest players mentally on the tour. To do it here was really special. I’m looking forward to coming back in two days. After the second set, after losing four match points, I don’t know. I just wanted to keep going in the third, enjoy every point to the end. It’s not over yet.”
After Nadal clawed his way back from an early break to parity in the 10th game of the first set, expectation strangled Goffin’s work. A double fault tipped him into a tie-break. Nadal, after a string of loose groundstrokes, served at 5-6 to stay in the set – but he dumped a backhand and Goffin breathed easily.
It was a disjointed affair, dramatically at odds with the fluid tennis that had preceded it, when Grigor Dimitrov beat Dominic Thiem 6-3, 5-7, 7-5 in two of the best sets of the long season. Little flowed smoothly in the night match. After an hour, Goffin was bossing it, with 10 aces making up nearly half of his 21 winners, while Nadal was curiously passive, guarding his injured knee.
Nadal had won more than a hundred matches in his career from a set down, and eight of 14 this season but his timing was off and the keen golfer was hooking routine backhands into the rough with worrying regularity. When Goffin smacked a startling forehand across Nadal’s static bow to go 5-3 up in the second, the match was his to lose. Stepping up to serve for the upset, he could not have been more imbued with confidence.
The Belgian has blown leads before this season, but there was little he could do about the sizzling backhand winner that left him stranded at 30-30. Nor was he in the right place to handle the down-the-line winner that gave Nadal another look. But a sloppy double fault was his own doing and Nadal was back in the match.
Goffin did brilliantly to fashion a match point – and woefully to squander it, before Nadal tigerishly got to a second tie-break, this time wrapping it up without fuss.
In the third, Nadal’s miseries multiplied. His movement stiffened, and this time Goffin stayed strong as his struggling prey grew weaker in the fight.
Earlier, Dimitrov and Thiem lit up the royal blue arena on the second day with classicism from another era. Alongside Federer, they are the only players in the top 20 with single-handed backhands – and how they let them flow. It was Dimitrov’s that whirred most like a scimitar under the TV lights, though, bringing him nine clean winners in two hours and 19 minutes on his way to subduing the gifted Austrian.
The first Bulgarian to make the eight-player finals, Dimitrov said courtside: “I’m not going to lie, I was pretty nervous in my first match. Great conditions, but you come in and you feel the weight on your shoulders. It’s never easy to play for the first time. Entering this tournament was a dream, not just to compete, but to win. Things seem to be going the right way so far. You fail and you get back up again. There were a few close calls. On to the next one.”
In the afternoon, Jamie Murray and Bruno Soares regretted missed opportunities against the American Bryan brothers, Bob and Mike, who survived two concerted fightbacks to win 7-5, 6-7 (3), 10-8.


Italy’s shock failure to reach Russia proved to be Gianluigi Buffon’s final international. The 39-year-old called time on his 20-year, 175-cap career after the 1-0 aggregate play-off defeat to Sweden.
“It is upsetting that my last match decided we didn’t qualify for the World Cup,” Buffon said. “I’m sorry. Not for me but for Italy. We blew something that could have meant so much. The only regret is that it ended like this.”
The Juventus goalkeeper, who made his Italy debut in October 1997, had decided to retire from international duty after the 2018 World Cup and confirmed he will take his leave early. “The blame is divided equally among all of us. There must be no scapegoats,” he said. “We win together and we lose together.”
Daniele De Rossi and Andrea Barzagli also announced their international retirement. Buffon hinted the defender Giorgio Chiellini will join them but insisted the national team’s future is bright.

Italy have 75% of possession and 23 shots on goal but look predictable. With the score 0-0, they desperately need a goal but Ventura leaves the creative forward Lorenzo Insigne on the bench. The final whistle blows and Italy have lost 1-0 on aggregate. "Apocalypse, tragedy, catastrophe," says the Italian press
“There’s definitely a future, because we have pride and strength,” he said. “We’re stubborn and hard-headed. After ugly falls we find a way to rise back up. A lot of these kids are talented, including Gianluigi Donnarumma and Mattia Perin. I wish them a lot of luck.”
Buffon was in goal when Italy won the World Cup for the fourth time in 2006 by beating France in the notorious final when Zinedine Zidane headbutted Marco Materazzi. He was also in the squad in 1998, 2002, 2010 and 2014.
Gian Piero Ventura denied reports of his resignation in his post-match press conference. “I apologise for the result but not for the effort and hard work,” the manager said. “I do realise the result is the most important thing.”
Italy’s leading sports daily newspaper described the failure to reach the World Cup for the first time since 1958 as the arrival of the apocalypse.
La Gazzetta dello Sport blamed “opportunities missed” in an article titled: “Italy, this is the apocalypse.” It continued: “We will not be with you and you will not be with us. A love so great must be reserved for other things. There will be inevitable consequences but let’s just see if they stop with Ventura or go further.”
La Gazzetta also suggested Carlo Ancelotti, who is available after leaving Bayern Munich, and Antonio Conte as Ventura’s potential successors.
Sweden celebrated their first World Cup qualification since 2006 – with captain Andreas Granqvist shaving his head to honour a bet with team-mates. “I thought they had forgotten it but they definitely did not,” Granqvist said.


A British doctor who was attacked by a shark on the New South Wales central coast while surfing says he owes Mick Fanning a drink after copying the professional surfer’s tactics and punching the animal off.
Charlie Fry, 25, was surfing with three friends at Avoca beach on Monday afternoon when a shark hit him on the shoulder.
“I said: ‘Just do what Mick did, just punch it in the nose’,” Fry told the Nine Network on Tuesday. “If you are watching or listening, Mick, I owe you a beer, thank you very much.”
Fry said he was up to 40 metres offshore when the shark jumped out of the water and hit him on the right shoulder.
“I got this massive thud on my right-hand side, which completely blindsided me. I thought it was a friend goofing around. I turned and I saw this shark come out of the water and breach its head.
“I punched it in the face with my left hand ... and managed to scramble back on my board, shout at my friends. Luckily a wave came, so I just surfed the wave in,” he said.
“I was just surfing, [saying] get in as fast as possible, ride the wave as fast as possible, ride the wave as long as you can and start paddling for your life essentially. It was very, very hectic. Very, very hectic.”
Fry said he was not conscious of his injured and bleeding arm until he reached the shore.
“I didn’t really notice it at the time because when you’re surfing, all I’m thinking was: ‘I’m about to die. I’m literally about to die’,” Fry said.
He was taken to Gosford hospital with scratches and a puncture wound on his shoulder.
The Westpac Life Saver Rescue Helicopters said a three-metre shark, probably a bronze whaler, had been sighted in the surf zone at Avoca.
Avoca Beach and North Avoca will remain closed for Tuesday.
Australian surfing great Fanning was attacked by a great white while competing at Jeffreys Bay in South Africa in 2015 and walked away physically unscathed after fighting it off.
Fry indicated he would be taking a break from surfing for the foreseeable future.
“I probably wouldn’t go to that point for a while. It is called ‘shark tower’ for a reason, so I will probably just go somewhere else,” he said. “I mean, the surf was rubbish. It wasn’t even worth it.”


Gareth Southgate believes the increased competition for places generated within the England squad, born of his determination to promote youth, will ensure players think twice about withdrawing from squads.
The national manager will recall Joe Hart, Kyle Walker and Gary Cahill to his starting lineup for the friendly against Brazil on Tuesday night, but Ruben Loftus-Cheek is expected to retain a place in midfield after his hugely encouraging debut against Germany. Lewis Cook and Dominic Solanke, key performers in the under-20s’ World Cup success over the summer but inexperienced at Premier League level, will hope for involvement from the bench, while Marcus Rashford, now 20, should start and Joe Gomez will gain a second cap at some stage after his substitute appearance last Friday.
Loftus-Cheek, a player who has made only 12 top-flight starts and is on loan at Crystal Palace, would have been picked for the last two World Cup qualifiers in October had he been fit but the youngsters called up to the current squad are effectively making the most of the withdrawal of eight seniors with various knocks and niggles. The FA’s medical staff were satisfied by the validity of those injuries, for all that the players would expect to feature for their clubs this weekend. Chelsea’s Danny Drinkwater turned down the chance to join up after suffering a relapse of a calf problem.
Southgate has already handed out 13 debuts in as many matches in charge. Asked if the praise heaped on new faces such as Loftus-Cheek and Jordan Pickford since Friday’s draw with the World Cup holders might mean players consider the wider picture before dropping out, he said: “Yes, that’s what you want to get to as a team, that the competition for places is so intense. [Philippe] Coutinho hasn’t played for a few weeks for Liverpool but he is there for Brazil. I imagine part of that is because he is thinking: ‘If I’m not there and I’m not playing and someone else goes in, do I get the shirt back?’ Maybe we haven’t had that but I think, moving forward, we will have, and I think that will affect people’s approach definitely.
“Someone said to me, ‘[the emergence of young talent] is causing you selection headaches’. No, because you want competition for places. The best way to get the maximum out of a player is competition for your place and no opportunity to take [your foot] off the gas in training or in any of the matches. And then you have to perform. You support people in difficult moments but, equally, when you have got that competition it drives the level of training. The energy in training has been high.”
England have beaten Brazil only once since 1990, with Southgate describing the team ranked No2 in the world as “a juggernaut”. While the hope is the home side build on the promise displayed against Germany, there is a realism among the management staff – and within the FA – that short-term results may be risked in favour of long‑term development. “The more you beat those top teams then, of course, you take that confidence with you, but I have to balance our desire to win games with some experimentation that does mean you do risk results,” Southgate said. “We could set up to play a certain way to give ourselves a better chance of winning any individual game, with more experienced players.
“We could take the short-term view regarding who might be more experienced going into a tournament and have more big-match experience, or we think outside the box and have a look at a few players we want to find out more about and see how they cope. There’s something bigger I’m working for than just getting results in the short-term and my own personal ambitions. If you’re a coach your mindset has to be to help people improve and maximise what’s possible. It is the right decision for England.
“When it comes to the World Cup, I will go with what I think is the best squad. At the moment, I believe the best would include a lot those young players. It’s easy to be swayed at times by needing experience, but you can have 100 experiences of the same thing or 10 different experiences that make you a more rounded person. These young players have also had experience of winning youth tournaments, playing high-level matches, and challenges to get to where they are in their path. So they’ve had to show some resilience of their own.
“We’d love to have a team full of players who have won the Champions League but we haven’t got that. But I want players who will be fearless, prepared to have the ball and show what they are capable of on the biggest stage.”


Northern Ireland’s remarkable era under Michael O’Neill could be nearing its end, with Scotland preparing to tempt the manager with a double-your-money offer to succeed Gordon Strachan.
O’Neill is likely to receive offers from clubs and countries following Northern Ireland’s controversial defeat by Switzerland in the World Cup play-offs.
The 48-year-old, who has also been linked with the vacancies at Sunderland and Rangers, insisted it was too early to contemplate his future in the aftermath of Sunday’s elimination in Basel.
Scotland hope to capitalise on Northern Ireland’s misery by offering O’Neill a four-year contract worth up to £1m per year with bonuses – double what he earns with the Irish Football Association – to revive their dwindling fortunes. O’Neill, who lives in Edinburgh, is well-known to officials at the Scottish FA and is their first choice for the job.
Austin MacPhee, his Kirkcaldy-born assistant with Northern Ireland who is also assistant head coach at Heart of Midlothian, is expected to be offered a director of football role with the SFA.
O’Neill is under contract at the IFA until 2020 with a compensation clause of £750,000. However, that sum is graded according to where O’Neill goes and is likely to have dropped as a consequence of Northern Ireland not qualifying for their first World Cup since 1986.
Their next competitive qualifier is not until March 2019 and, although a club role would offer the former Brechin City and Shamrock Rovers manager more day-to-day involvement, he is happy – and successful – in international football.
Scotland could face competition for O’Neill’s services from Major League Soccer. Several clubs in the United States are believed to be interested in O’Neill, who has a brother in Chicago and is a fan of US sports.
Northern Ireland’s players were united in their desire for O’Neill to continue following the gut-wrenching play-off defeat but unsure about his intentions.
Jonny Evans said: “As a manager he’s unbelievable, we all love him and every single player plays for him. It would be a shame to lose him but we know on the other side, management is such a difficult job and if something came up, where it would be difficult to turn down, no one would ever begrudge him that.
“I can definitely understand why there is interest in him. He’s so inspirational, he’s very tactical. Even the other night, we had just got off the plane and were on the bus to the hotel. He had watched the first half of the game and he came down the bus and said: ‘We’re calling a meeting tonight and we’re going to watch the game again because you didn’t play that bad, there are so many basic things you can improve on.’ It gave everyone a lift straight away. He’s got such composure and his team talks, he says the right things to get the lads going. You can see everyone plays for him and we all really, really respect him.”
Michael McGovern, Northern Ireland’s goalkeeper, concurred: “Michael’s stock is so high at the minute. We would love him to stay but I’m sure there will be interest elsewhere. Michael is his own man and makes his own decisions. If he’s here for the next campaign, we will be absolutely delighted as players.”
The sense that the Switzerland game marked the end of an era was not restricted to the manager. Gareth McAuley declined to comment on his future but Evans said he was “95% certain” his 37-year-old defensive partner would not retire from international football. Chris Brunt, however, admitted he was considering whether to continue and the 38-year-old Aaron Hughes, who made his 109th appearance against Switzerland, may also retire.
“All good things have to come to an end at some stage,” said Brunt. “It’s been very good the last four or five years under Michael. It’s been as enjoyable to be part of this group as any I’ve been involved in and I’ve been playing for the last 14 years. It would have been nice to top it off with the World Cup, but it wasn’t to be. I don’t think it’s time to say anything now. I’m as gutted as I’ve ever been in my football career.”


Roy Keane said last week the key to Martin O’Neill’s celebrated motivational acumen boils down to a knack for saying the right thing at the right time. So it was intriguing, on the eve of Tuesday’s second leg of the tautly wound World Cup play‑off between the Republic of Ireland and Denmark, to hear O’Neill tease his captain, David Meyler, about missing penalties in training.
There is a real possibility of the match here ending in the same 0-0 scoreline as the first leg on Saturday and, therefore, of a penalty shootout being required. That would determine who advances to the World Cup finals, and who is left to survey the rubble of a 14-month qualification campaign. When asked about that scenario, Meyler declared his confidence he would score from the spot if called.
Not many managers would have chosen that moment to bring their player’s training-ground failures to public attention but O’Neill did so with a deadpan interjection. Everyone in the room laughed, except Meyler, who, after being taken by surprise, looked playfully exasperated. O’Neill had succeeded in introducing levity into what could have been a heavy preview – but in a pointed way. He defused the tension around the occasion while reminding his player talk is cheap. Deeds are sport’s true currency.
For Ireland, this play-off is a balancing act. They must find the right blend between defence and attack, fervour and composure. In Copenhagen they defended with steel but offered little going forward. O’Neill knows that must change, at least a little, if they are to score the one goal or more they will need to progress without a shootout. He knows his players must remain focused enough to deny space to inventive Danes such as Christian Eriksen and Thomas Delaney. They must also pass more incisively than they did on Saturday, when they concentrated so hard on keeping the ball away from their own goal they neglected to figure out how to get it near Denmark’s.
“We will try to be that bit more expansive if we can and deal with the ball a wee bit better,” O’Neill said. Wes Hoolahan often delivers the ideal mixture but usually begins on the bench, where he stayed in the first leg. O’Neill did not say whether the Norwich City schemer would start on Tuesday.
The suspicion is the only changes will see Meyler return to central midfield so Robbie Brady can shift wide and replace Callum O’Dowda, while Shane Long may start up front. The Southampton striker has not scored for club or country since February but Denmark’s defenders may be more bothered by his mobility than by Daryl Murphy’s brawn.
O’Neill hailed his team’s fighting qualities but said: “It should not be everything in our side because eventually, as well as spirit, you have to be able to play.”
Meyler reckoned Ireland’s spirit will give them the edge: “Denmark don’t have the character, heart and desire we have.” The opposing manager, Age Hareide, retorted: “He doesn’t know us.”
O’Neill referred to his team’s record of rising somehow to grand occasions. “We are going to try to win the game and will try to find a way to win it,” he said. “These players have been able to do that in the last couple of years.”
Teams of similar or higher standing to Denmark can vouch for that, including Germany, Italy, Bosnia‑Herzegovina, Austria and Wales – all beaten by Ireland in high-stakes showdowns.
In this campaign, Ireland’s best performances came away from home. They scored only four goals in their five group games in Dublin. Hareide highlighted this fact and referred to the possession and pass completion statistics from the first leg, which were heavily in Denmark’s favour. He is not buying O’Neill’s attacking talk. “Ireland will play the same way,” he said. “They just want us to make mistakes. That’s OK. I haven’t got the patience to play like that. We’ll try to attack.”
He is so convinced Denmark will break through this time they have not practised penalties. “We won’t need them,” he said.
Ireland (4-2-3-1, probable): Randolph; Christie, Clark, Duffy, Ward; Arter, Meyler; Brady, Hendrick, McClean; Long.
Denmark (4-3-3, probable): Schmeichel; Ankersen, Kjaear, Bjelland, Larsen; Eriksen, Kvist, Delaney; Poulsen, Cornelius, Sisto.

The Wallabies usually arrive in London to the familiar soundtrack of their old friend Eddie Jones setting the sharp-tongued agenda for the week. This time they have been greeted by something far more disconcerting: an Australian sports coach apologising for swearing and talking up the visitors in conciliatory tones more normally associated with the archbishop of Canterbury.
Having been a champion sledger in his time, Jones still has the capacity to dish it out when the opportunity arises but he has not relished the widespread coverage of his televised outburst during the 21-8 win against Argentina on Saturday. “It’s not acceptable … I’ll find a different way to express my frustration in the future,” said Jones, later revealing to the BBC Rugby Weekly podcast he had received a reprimand from his 93-year-old mother.
“I got a phone call this morning from my mother rapping me over the knuckles,” he said. “She still tells me not to swear. I am in the dog house and certainly won’t do it again. I should have shown more self-control.”
The perfect antidote would be a convincing England victory against the Wallabies and, despite his frustrated notebook-throwing, Jones believes his side were not irredeemably bad against a big, strong Argentina team. Rather than giving his players a mouthful in public having reviewed the tape, he has instead opted to point the finger at himself.
“Argentina are a difficult team but I obviously didn’t coach the team well enough. It’s my fault the team didn’t play well so I take full responsibility for that.”
There is also a part of him that enjoys the occasional scrappy win, the rationale being that World Cups are never won without at least one below-par performance en route. “I don’t mind winning dirty,” Jones said. “To me rugby is a game that can be played beautifully badly or beautifully well. They tried to bludgeon us and they couldn’t – we stood up to the task with a team put together very quickly. I know you are disappointed with how we played. So are we. But those things happen. It’s like when you bat; sometimes you score a beautiful 100 and sometimes you score a terrible 70. But that terrible 70 might save or win you a Test match so that innings on Saturday was important.”
If there is a potential message there for England’s batsmen before the Ashes series, it is equally clear Jones will expect a sharply improved display against Michael Cheika’s Wallabies, who have bounced back from a lean period and proved too good for Wales in Cardiff on Saturday. As yet there is no firm indication whether Owen Farrell and Maro Itoje will return to England’s starting lineup but the pair’s inclusion on the World Player of the Year shortlist has underlined their rising status on the global stage.
With Jonny May fully fit again and Mike Brown also going through the mandatory return-to-play protocols after being concussed against the Pumas, Jones has further decisions to make behind the scrum in a week he has already designed to be slightly different preparation-wise. Instead of a heavy training day on Tuesday, the squad’s main session will now occur on Wednesday when the players will also transfer from their normal Pennyhill Park base to a different hotel in Syon Park to replicate their itinerant life in Japan during the 2019 World Cup.
Jones will stop short of serving the squad sushi at mealtimes but he does want his team to be ready for all eventualities. “In Japan, we might have to change hotels two days before a game. We might have to fly to a hotel that has had karaoke in it for 10 days and we’re going to have to adjust. It’s not a perfect world. Life at Pennyhill is perfect but that’s not going to win us the World Cup. We have to be adaptable and adjustable and robust. We have to find ways to win and that’s why I’m looking forward to Saturday. I know Australia are going to bring their best and we’re going to have to find a way to win. We won’t have any excuses. There’s always a balancing act but to me, ultimately, I was employed to win the World Cup and that is what I’m intending to do.”
That mission will receive a timely boost if England can beat a team Jones rates as “probably the form team in the world at the moment” under the command of his old Randwick team-mate Cheika. Last year England won four successive Tests against Australia but even Jones concedes his compatriots have responded impressively. “Knowing Cheik he’ll have been hatching a plan immediately and I think he’s done that. He’s rebuilt that side twice now which is a fair job. The game’s certainly going to another level. Are we ready for it? That’s what we’ll find out on Saturday.”


Given one last chance to seize a place at the World Cup Italy pressed, they pushed, but they could not prevail, and as a result next summer’s tournament will take place without them. It is their first such failure in six decades, the Azzurri joining Holland as Europe’s most notable qualifying failures. Both of them were eliminated by Sweden, whose route to Russia has been far from straightforward.
Jakob Johansson’s goal in the first leg ultimately decided the tie in the Swedes’ favour. Here his side’s only ambition was to repel at any cost the waves of attacks rolling towards them, a job they did heroically if not entirely nervelessly.

Italy have 75% of possession and 23 shots on goal but look predictable. With the score 0-0, they desperately need a goal but Ventura leaves the creative forward Lorenzo Insigne on the bench. The final whistle blows and Italy have lost 1-0 on aggregate. "Apocalypse, tragedy, catastrophe," says the Italian press
Carlo Tavecchio, the president of the Italian FA, famously said in September that “not qualifying would be an apocalypse”. That day has arrived, with Gianluigi Buffon tearfully admitting his 175th cap would be his last and Daniele De Rossi – a substitute who when asked to warm up in the second half refused because “I wanted them to bring on attacking players” – also announcing his international retirement. Meanwhile Gian Piero Ventura’s tenure as coach is surely over, even if he said after the game he was yet to resign.
His side had 75% of possession and 23 shots to their rivals’ four but there was no way past the visitors’ determined rearguard, the four Norsemen of the apocalypse. “We had no weapons left. We just had to sit there and hope we could hang on,” said the Sweden coach, Jan Andersson. “We couldn’t do it in any other way, they are so skilful.”
De Rossi described “a funereal atmosphere” after the final whistle. “It’s a dark moment for our football,” he said. “Beyond everything that was wrong tactically, technically and physically, we just did not deserve to qualify.”
Amid the disappointment there will also be anger. Ventura had demanded “we get at the San Siro what they got in Stockholm” after criticising the performance of Cuneyt Cakir, the Turkish referee, in the first leg. They did not: both sides had penalty appeals turned down by Antonio Mateu Lahoz, the Spanish official who took charge of this game. Italy will be particularly puzzled that a 47th-minute incident in which Matteo Darmian was kneed in the stomach by Mikael Lustig inside the penalty area resulted in Sweden being awarded a free-kick for handball, particularly as the ball seemed to strike the Manchester United defender on the thigh.
The particular irony here was that Mateu Lahoz had been unable to spot even the most blatant handballs in the first half, when Darmian and Barzagli might have been punished. Before both of those incidents, with just nine minutes played, Andreas Granqvist seemed to trip Marco Parolo from behind. Had the video officials who review key decisions in every Serie A game also been used in this match, it would have been completely different.
Italy were not good enough to find a way through Sweden’s defence but this was still a marked improvement on the first leg. Much of the credit for this must go to Jorginho, the Napoli midfielder who Ventura had never previously considered worthy of so much as a place in his squad. As he did last season, the 25-year-old has played more passes per game than any player not just in Serie A but any of Europe’s major leagues, but the coach had dismissed him in a specialist in “a role that does not exist” in his side. This will be remembered as one of his many mistakes.
He was Italy’s most creative player, and though he faded in the second half he alone threatened to carve a way through the centre of Sweden’s defence. In the 27th minute he lifted a perfectly-judged pass over the visitors’ rearguard and into the path of Manolo Gabbiadini, whose low cross zipped through a crowded six-yard box before being battered over the bar by Antonio Candreva. Then in the 40th minute he picked out Ciro Immobile, whose shot hit the onrushing Robin Olsen but continued on its path goalwards until Granqvist booted clear.

Other than the penalty appeals Sweden never threatened. They were not helped by a serious injury to Johansson, who was stretching for a bouncing ball in an otherwise empty centre circle in the 17th minute when his knee buckled, and left the field on a stretcher. They were content to crowd the central areas, allowing Candreva and the disappointing Darmian space on the flanks, relying on their ability to reach any cross first, and booting any ball they got within touching distance of upfield.
Italy came close on occasion: Parolo’s late header and Florenzi stylish volley both went just wide, while Lustig’s header looped on to his own bar. Olsen, without being seriously tested, saved from Parolo and the substitute Stephan El Shaarawy.
But by any means necessary Sweden defended their narrow lead until the last, a feat that for all their pain Italians should surely appreciate.


French skier David Poisson, who won a bronze medal in the downhill at the 2013 world championships, died in a training accident on Monday. He was 35.
The French skiing federation confirmed the news in a statement. “The federation joins the pain of his loved ones in these particularly difficult times,” it said.
Poisson died at the Nakiska ski resort west of Calgary, where he was preparing for the upcoming World Cup events in North America. The first event takes place this month at Alberta’s Lake Louise. His best finish at a World Cup event came in 2015 when he finished third at Santa Caterina in Italy.
Can't believe the tragic news of #davidpoisson today.A great guy who was always either charging or smiling. ❤️ to all his family. @fisalpine
The four-time Olympic skier Chemmy Alcott paid tribute to Poisson on Twitter. “Can’t believe the tragic news. A great guy who was always either charging or smiling,” she wrote.
Poisson was a popular figure on the ski circuit known for his broad grin, and was nicknamed “Caillou” (“small stone”) due to his small, stocky physique. The International Ski Federation paid tribute to “a respected and accomplished athlete on the World Cup tour ever since his debut in 2004”.
Poisson represented France at two Winter Olympics, finishing seventh in the downhill in 2010 and 16th in 2014. His death is not the first time French skiing has been hit by tragedy. World Super G champion Regine Cavagnoud was killed in a collision while training in 2001.


Inside a packed New York City courtroom, and under heightened security on Monday, US prosecutors accused three former South American football administrators of taking millions of dollars in bribes as part of a web of endemic corruption at the heart of the sport’s governing body, Fifa.
José Maria Marin, the 85-year-old former head of Brazil’s football federation, Juan Ángel Napout, the 59-year-old Paraguayan who was president of South American football’s governing body Conmebol, and Manuel Burga the 60-year-old former president of the Peruvian football federation, have denied multiple counts of racketeering, wire fraud and money laundering.
Their trial is the first in a sprawling federal corruption investigation of Fifa that was announced in May 2015 after several officials were arrested during a morning raid on a hotel in Zurich. Since then more than 40 officials and marketing executives have been charged by US authorities with 23 already pleading guilty.
As the defendants looked on, Marin staring ahead, Burga with his head in his hand and Napout appearing to take frantic notes, assistant US attorney Keith Edelman pointed to each of the men and told the jury: “These defendants cheated the sport in order to benefit themselves.” He added that they “did it year after year, tournament after tournament, bribe after bribe”.
The trial will focus on how marketing and sponsorship rights were sold for two major South American tournaments, the Copa América and the Copa Libertadores, as well as the Brazilian domestic tournament Copa do Brasil. The officials are accused of regularly taking six-figure bribes.
During his opening remarks, Edelman singled out an event in May 2014 in Miami, Florida, where Fifa officials had gathered to announce a special centennial expansion of the Copa América, which would be held in the United States for the first time.
“By all appearances it’s a proud moment in the history of the game,” Edleman told the jury. “There are drinks, press conferences but underneath the surface are lies, greed, corruption. Some of these officials had other reasons to celebrate, they had agreed to receive millions of dollars in bribes regarding the tournament.”
Edelman said the US government would present evidence, derived from witness testimony, bank records, covert recordings and other documentation that proved each of the officials had received bribes. Marin, Edelman said, had received “millions into a US bank account”. Napout, the prosecutor alleged, had received his money in cash, sometimes “over $100,000 at a time”, whereas Marin, who had been the subject of a domestic corruption investigation, had told a middleman to “hold on to the money until the coast was clear”.
In each of their openings defense attorneys did not deny there had been corruption at Fifa, but said their clients were not part of it. They accused the US government of relying on the testimony of Fifa officials who had already pleaded guilty and cooperated with authorities in order to reduce their own sentences.
Argentinian-Italian marketing executive Alejandro Burzaco is expected to be a key government witness, and according to Napout’s attorney, Silvia Pinera, got a “sweetheart deal” after he “turned himself in and began telling stories”. She accused the US government of paying other guilty officials hundreds of thousands of dollars to remain in the country to testify and providing their families with visas to the United States.
“They’ve been here for years on our dimes,” Pinera told the jury. “We’re the taxpayer.”
Bruce Udolf, an attorney for Burga, argued that the government had “simply gone too far” and “simply got it wrong” by charging his client, labelling the allegations “despicable”.
“They’ve made a lot of righteous charges against a lot of bad people. But Manuel Burga is not one of them,” Udolf said.
Charles Stillman, Marin’s attorney, likened the conspiracy to a match of football among children, arguing his client had remained out of the game while other more senior officials dictated the play. “Marin was not one of them,” he told the jury. “He’s kind of like the youngster standing off to the side, picking up daisies.”
Both prosecutors and defense attorneys were at pains to explain to the court the significance of Fifa and football itself by comparing them to US sports.
“It [Fifa] is kind of like the NFL or Major League Baseball but it’s for soccer all around the world,” Edelman told the jury. He added: “Here and around the world soccer is more than just a sport. It’s a passion, a way of life.”
The trial is expected to last up to six weeks. All three defendants face extensive prison time if found guilty.


Tracey Crouch, the sports minister, will be questioned on Tuesday on the unfurling crisis within British Gymnastics as the governing body remains in dispute with its biggest stars over World Class Performance Programme contracts. Crouch will appear before the government’s digital, culture, media and sport select committee as part of its inquiry into sports governance.
The Guardian revealed on Monday that the entire men’s artistic gymnastics team, including the double Olympic champion Max Whitlock, had rejected draft versions of contracts, stating they would not sign them until alterations were made. British Gymnastics is meeting athletes, agents and parents on Tuesday in an attempt to resolve the situation.
The governing body released a lengthy statement on Monday night in which it said it was “currently in consultation” with the athletes over the contracts. It added: “British Gymnastics is working hard to ensure all athletes are comfortable with the agreement before signing. To date, over 50% have already signed the agreement. No athlete has refused to sign and the consultation process is still ongoing. We do not believe there is any serious conflict with our athletes, who are valued members of British Gymnastics.”
The DCMS committee chair, Damian Collins, has pledged to push Crouch on the protection given to athletes over contracts, which they must sign to receive funding from UK Sport. As a non-departmental body of the DCMS, UK Sport is answerable to Crouch. She is also expected to face questions about accountability for UK Sport funded governing bodies.
Several coaches had also told the Guardian they felt there was a “culture of fear” within British Gymnastics presided over by its chief executive, Jane Allen, and they had therefore lost faith in her leadership. British Gymnastics strongly denies these allegations.
It is the latest Olympic sport to receive such criticism, following similar allegations in cycling, rowing, bobsleigh and equestrianism.
The former gymnast Dan Keatings, a world silver medallist, said the culture within British Gymnastics was nothing new. “This has been going on for years,” he wrote on Twitter. “Really glad to see the gymnasts are now sticking up for themselves.” Keatings, who retired in January, also told the BBC he experienced “bullying and manipulation” throughout his career in the sport, and “fear is very, very real”. He added: “I’m one of the athletes that was never able to say anything because I was scared of not being selected for the team which then leads to losing funding.”
Crouch will also be grilled over what has been called an “intimidation” tactic used by UK Sport against Jess Varnish, the cyclist who is taking legal action against the funding body and British Cycling. Varnish is suing for sex discrimination, detriment for whistleblowing, victimisation and unfair dismissal. Collins is known to take a dim view of UK Sport’s application to freeze Varnish’s assets, which would have forced her to drop her claim had it been successful.


Nathaniel Clyne has suffered another injury setback that is likely to keep the Liverpool defender out until February.
The right-back, who has endured a miserable campaign after sustaining a back injury in a pre-season game in July, will now spend up to three more months out recovering from a minor operation.
Clyne had started running again at Melwood in September when Jürgen Klopp called his progress encouraging but the 26‑year‑old has had surgery which will delay his return further. The setback is even more frustrating for the England defender with time running out for him to stake a claim for a World Cup squad place.
In what has been a season punctuated by injuries for Liverpool, Sadio Mané is heading back to Merseyside having aggravated his hamstring injury. The forward, who had only returned to domestic action against West Ham on 4 November, has been sent back to Melwood after leading Senegal to World Cup qualification.
Mané played a key role in Senegal’s crucial 2-0 win over South Africa in Polokwane but then complained of discomfort. Senegal agreed was to return the 25-year-old to Liverpool for further treatment. A Senegal statement confirmed Mané had suffered a slight recurrence of “an old injury”.
Klopp will be desperate to have arguably his most influential player fit as Liverpool head into a key week. They host Southampton on Saturday before a Champions League trip to Sevilla on 21 November. Chelsea arrive at Anfield on 25 November for a Saturday evening match.
“It is a concern that the hamstring injury is again on the agenda and it will be critical for us to monitor and manage that in the coming days,” Klopp said. “At this stage we haven’t seen Sadio yet to properly assess the extent, but what is clear is that we will have to stay on top of this for the rest of the week and make sure we are careful in how we look after him.
“All I can really say with certainty is that we will assess Sadio as soon as he lands back in the country and make decisions on what rehab and treatment gives him the best chance of being back fit and strong for the important fixtures we have coming.
“There has been really strong communication between ourselves and Senegal to ensure the player is properly protected and looked after. We respect how important he is for Senegal and therefore it must always be the case that they get to make the decision when he is under their care. It should not be forgotten in Liverpool, either, how important it is to Sadio that he represents his country whenever he is fit enough to do so. He is so proud of his country and recognises what a role model he is for them.”
Philippe Coutinho is expected to play some part for Brazil in the friendly against England on Tuesday. The playmaker has missed Liverpool’s last three matches with an abductor strain but is fit enough to play at Wembley.
Jordan Henderson – who pulled out of the England squad for their two friendlies – did not train as he continues his recovery from a thigh problem. His fellow midfielder Adam Lallana, who is approaching full fitness after a thigh injury, continued to work on his own rather than take part in full training – but is expected to feature in a training match at Melwood on Tuesday.


A Conservative MP has expressed serious concern over the way racing’s ruling body conducts investigations and has promised it will face increased scrutiny. Richard Benyon, whose Newbury seat includes the training centre of Lambourn, said he had become worried about the case being pursued by the British Horseracing Authority against Hughie Morrison, whose East Ilsley stable is in Benyon’s constituency.
“I think the BHA under its current leadership have done some good things,” Benyon said. “But in terms of how they are dealing with issues as important as this one is for businesses in my constituency, the more I’ve looked at how they’ve managed this case and the more I’ve heard from experts on the subject about how they’ve managed other cases, the more concerned I get.” In a statement the BHA insisted its processes are “fair, open and transparent”.
Morrison was charged by the BHA in May after a horse of his tested positive for an anabolic steroid. The trainer strenuously denies any wrongdoing and has offered a £10,000 reward for information that could help shed light on how the drug got into his horse’s system. As yet, no date has been set for a hearing.
Benyon said he had raised the matter with the BHA chief executive, Nick Rust, and been disappointed by the response at a meeting of the All-Party Racing and Bloodstock Group. “He seemed to suggest that people like me who raise concerns about the professionalism of the BHA want racing to be regulated by some sort of chumocracy, that I was saying Hughie shouldn’t be pursued because he’s ‘a good chap’,” Benyon said. “I was really cross that he made that interpretation. It is absolutely not what I’m saying.
“What I want is a highly professional regulator so that, when these accusations come along that can potentially ruin someone’s business, they will work quickly and fairly to process the case. In Hughie Morrison’s case, this could put out of work 10% of a village community, I expect the BHA to be entirely straight and to operate under the rules of natural justice.
“For example, they should share all available information [relating to the case] and they haven’t. They deny it, they say they have shared it but Hughie Morrison and his team have shown me what the BHA have failed to provide. We are talking about pretty basic procedures like the handling of urine or blood samples.”
Benyon, who said he would not discuss specifics of the case in order to avoid prejudicing Morrison’s defence, is also worried about how long it is taking. “Justice delayed is justice denied. I’m fully happy to accept these are complicated cases but this is a sword of Damocles hanging over not just Hughie’s business but the whole training community in a place like west Berkshire. Those people are thinking: ‘Hang on, have I got someone who might wish me harm, perhaps a disgruntled ex-employee or someone trying to dope a different horse? Could I one day be in the same position?’
“They’ve got to be super-efficient and quick. I think they should be transparent. They should be a professional regulator that looks into allegations, handles it all in a timely fashion and provides all the information it should provide to the accused person.
“There are lots of questions being raised by a lot of people about whether they have done this, in this and other cases. When this case is over, I intend to look into it. I and a lot of others are not going to let this lie. We want this organisation to be accountable.”
The BHA’s statement said: “The BHA is the government-recognised body who has the responsibility to keep racing clean, enforce the rules and ensure our values of fairness and honesty are upheld by all participants. The investigation processes followed by the BHA are fair, open and transparent and follow the recommendations of our recent integrity review and an independent review by leading QC Christopher Quinlan.
“The disciplinary panel which oversees these cases is independent and chaired by a legally qualified person who is responsible for the pre-hearing preparation, including making final decisions on disclosure. The panel is always accessible to the defendants’ representatives throughout, so they can raise any points of procedure, including applying for material to be disclosed. This is in line with principles that are well established in court cases in the UK. The defendant may also request delays to the case being heard in order to prepare their defence.
“We welcome scrutiny of all our investigative procedures and would be happy to speak to Mr Benyon about this after the conclusion of the investigation. The procedures followed by the BHA – as recommended by the independent Quinlan Review – are designed to ensure that the BHA is at the forefront of best practice when it comes to investigation management in sport, and this includes delivering justice in a timely manner.
“The BHA regularly attends meetings of the All-Party Racing and Bloodstock Group in Westminster to discuss ongoing matters in British racing. The Hughie Morrison investigation was one of several matters discussed at September’s meeting, where a range of views regarding the case were expressed by the group’s members.
“Nick Rust outlined the BHA’s position as far as possible, given this is an active case, and stated that the outcome would be decided on by an independent disciplinary panel based only on the evidence put in front of them.”

Colin Kaepernick has been named GQ’s citizen of the year after a period in which his protest against racial and social injustice in the US has seen the former NFL quarterback become one of the most divisive figures in America.
Kaepernick’s story in the GQ profile is told by those close to him, including his former team-mate Eric Reid, his partner Nessa Diab, film-maker Ava DuVernay and academic and Guardian columnist Ameer Hasan Loggins. The article says that Kaepernick, whose stance has been attacked by Donald Trump, is not quoted directly in the story as he believes in “the power of silence”.

“Colin … made it clear to us that he intended to remain silent,” according to the article. “As his public identity has begun to shift from football star to embattled activist, he has grown wise to the power of his silence. It has helped his story go around the world. It has even provoked the ire and ill temper of Donald Trump. Why talk now, when your detractors will only twist your words and use them against you? Why speak now, when silence has done so much?”
Instead, GQ and Kaepernick decided to tell his story through those who know him and through a series of photos of the quarterback on the streets of Harlem – a nod to Muhammad Ali, who would sometimes train on the streets of New York during his exile from boxing after his refusal to participate in the Vietnam war. “That’s why we decided to photograph Colin in public, in Harlem, among the men, women, and children he is fighting for. To connect him to a crusade that stretches back decades,” the article states.

Kaepernick on Monday tweeted that he was “honored” by GQ’s award.
Kaepernick has not played in the NFL since he left the 49ers at the end of last season. The fact that Kaepernick, a player who led the 49ers to a Super Bowl appearance, has not been able to find a job in his prime years since has led many to believe he has been blackballed. Seattle Seahawks cornerback Richard Sherman has said that “it has nothing to do with football. You can see that.” Aaron Rodgers, arguably the best quarterback in the NFL, told ESPN in August that: “[Kaepernick] should be on a roster right now. I think because of his protests, he’s not.”

It is unlikely Kaepernick will return to the NFL anytime soon: he has filed a grievance claiming team owners colluded to keep him out of the league. One of the figures to pay tribute to Kaepernick’s stand in the GQ story was singer and activist Harry Belafonte.
“In my 90th year of life, to see people like Colin Kaepernick having gotten the message and carrying the cause forward is the greatest reward I could ask for,” said Belafonte. “Colin is a remarkable young man. The fact that he spoke out on police brutality against young black men – I thought it was absolutely admirable.”
GQ also named late TV host Stephen Colbert and NBA star Kevin Durant as their men of the year alongside Kaepernick. Actor Gal Gadot was named woman of the year.


Moeen Ali will be a vital player for England over the next two months but he has been unusually peripheral in the tour’s opening fortnight, laid low with the slightest of side strains. However, the all-rounder says he is now fit and ready to feature in England’s final warm-up game against a Cricket Australia XI on Wednesday, only eight days before the Test series starts at the Gabba, where his importance is magnified by the absence of Ben Stokes.
Jonny Bairstow, who has started the tour in fine form, and Moeen will move up a place in the batting order in the suspended Stokes’s absence in Townsville, and Moeen – who has long coveted a role in the top five – is not complaining. “Obviously I want him out here but also for myself it’s an opportunity to go up the order,” he said. “My whole thing is to try and get up the order as much as I can.”
England believe Moeen could have played the tour’s opening first-class match in Adelaide but rested him as a precaution, with the first Test in mind. He is now able to throw – the injury hindered this – and has netted comfortably for a week.
Moeen – speaking shortly after he and Alastair Cook had fed an 800kg, 4.5m crocodile called Bully a pair of chickens called Moeen and Alastair – knows Australia will target him just as ravenously and relentlessly.
When he bowls he expects to be attacked, immediately and brutally. Australia is a tough place to bowl finger-spin (although Nathan Lyon has fought fiercely to thrive), but Moeen believes he is a better bowler now than he was in his first Ashes series in 2015. He is inured to his bowling being under siege, and believes it improves his chances of taking wickets.
“They will definitely come after me,” he said. “It’s not anything new really. I’m looking forward to it and I think they’re going to come after a few of the guys. It’s that sort of Test series being the Ashes and I’ve had that many times before so I’m not too worried. If anything, you get more opportunity to do something better. If they come after you with the bat you always have a chance of getting wickets. We’ll see.”
He will be subject to hostility when he bats too, given a history of discomfort against the short ball. Accordingly, as England played in Adelaide, Moeen tried to go “over the top” with his net practices, making conditions as extreme as possible by improvising to help counter his perceived weakness. In the nets, Moeen places a reinforced, dense tray short of a length, soaks it with water, then gets the fielding coach, Paul Collingwood, to skim hardened balls off it from around 18 yards. It zips through, heightening pace and improving reactions. It has seen Moeen absorb some blows, too.
“I’ve been doing that recently to exaggerate the pace with the ball coming at you – it just sharpens you up,” said Moeen. “It’s a tray and you just wet it. It’s an Indian drill. I bring slightly different balls with me to do it, too. It skims off it. You need a good thrower, which Colly is. I’ve been hit before loads of times but the more I’m doing it the better I’m feeling.”
At times, Moeen has seemed a compulsive chaser of the short ball but he says he will judge it on its merit, and feels better equipped to deal with the short stuff than in the past. “It depends on how you feel, how you’re seeing the ball,” he says of whether he will take it on or not. “Some days I feel like I’m seeing it better. Some days I’m seeing it well but in the past I definitely didn’t have the technique to deal with it. But that’s something I’ve been working on.”
Townsville is something of a mystery to England. The pitch at the Tony Ireland Stadium (named after a local car dealer) is said to be quick and resembles the Gabba. But, so far, they have not encountered a quick pitch or a quick bowler apart from Nathan Coulter-Nile, who has since pulled up lame. The CA XI they will face is marginally different from the one in Adelaide but still offers no pace; Harry Conway, a New South Wales seamer, has replaced the injured left-armer Jackson Coleman, while Tim Paine, the only Test cricketer England have faced so far, has been recalled by Tasmania. He has been replaced by the wicketkeeper Harry Nielsen, son of Tim, the former Australia coach.
If England are struggling to replicate the environment they will face in Brisbane (even if Moeen is trying hard with his tray), Australia are battling to work out their XI. Into the third of three Sheffield Shield rounds that should decide three available slots in the Test team, cricketers are dodging, not demanding, selection.
Matt Renshaw, the 21-year-old Tees-side-born opening bat, continued a torrid run that has seen him go nine first‑class innings without a half-century, while the favourites to bat No6 and keep wicket, Glenn Maxwell and Matthew Wade respectively, also failed. One bright spot was Cameron Bancroft, the Western Australia opener who hardly shone at Gloucestershire but appears to be timing his run to perfection. He has 323 runs for once out in his past three innings (two of which came against Australia’s first‑choice attack last week) – and he is currently keeping wicket.


Ineos, the petrochemicals company founded by billionaire Brexit backer Jim Ratcliffe, has announced plans to buy a Swiss football club, the latest in a spree of seemingly unconnected acquisitions.
The privately owned firm said it was buying FC Lausanne-Sport, which plays in Switzerland’s top football league, to build on existing links it had forged with teams near its offices in Lausanne and the Swiss canton of Vaud.
David Thompson, the chief executive of Ineos Football, said the club had a good record of bringing forward young players locally. “It’s just a great opportunity for us really. We plan to bring in three or four senior players to form the core, the spine, of the team,” he said.
Thompson said the team’s manager, Fabio Celestini, had his backing and Ineos would support the club moving to a new stadium in 18 months’ time.
The value of the investment was not disclosed. It is not the first eye-opening acquisition by the company, which last month bought fashion brand Belstaff, famous for its motorcycle jackets.
In September the firm said it wanted UK government subsidies to build a successor to the Land Rover Defender, which ceased production in 2016. “It’s the opportunity that has arisen at the time,” said Thompson of the connection between the three projects.
Ineos attracted criticism for avoiding tax when it moved its headquarters to Switzerland in 2010, before moving back to the UK in 2016. About half of its businesses, including the Grangemouth oil refinery in Scotland which was at the centre of a bitter dispute over working conditions, are in the UK. The rest are in Switzerland.
Ratcliffe has overseen the company’s plan to become a big player in fracking, buying up more licences to explore for shale gas and oil in England.
Ineos is also fighting a legal challenge against an injunction it secured against protests near its shale sites, but it is yet to begin drilling or fracking.
The company cemented its foothold in fossil fuels this year, buying up oil and gas fields from a Danish state-owned firm for £1bn and paying BP £200m for a North Sea pipeline.


A Formula One test involving McLaren at Interlagos has been cancelled after security incidents at the Brazilian Grand Prix.
Eight members of Lewis Hamilton’s Mercedes team were robbed at gunpoint after leaving the circuit on Friday night. Staff from F1’s tyre supplier, Pirelli, were also targeted on Sunday night. The crew were unharmed but it was the last in a series of alarming incidents over the weekend, despite promises over security.
McLaren and Pirelli had intended to stay in São Paulo for the remainder of the week. The British driver Lando Norris, who turned 18 on Monday, had flown to Brazil to take part in the two-day tyre test alongside the Belgian driver Stoffel Vandoorne. That has now been scrapped after staff expressed their frustrations and unease over the lack of security. Staff from the McLaren’s staff were said to be relieved the test had been cancelled.
Earlier last week, a car containing officials from motor sport’s world governing body the FIA was approached by masked gunmen, while members of the Williams team witnessed the attack. Staff from Sauber were also held up as they left the circuit on Saturday. The incidents will raise question marks over the future of a race that has been a permanent fixture on the calendar since 1990.
“We are extremely disappointed with the events of last week,” said a Formula One spokesperson.
“But is not our call, and it is not our responsibility. Security within the circuit is up to the promoter and they have to liaise with the local authorities. We have our own security team that travels with us. We are actively involved, but we cannot be experts in every city we go to.
“We don’t want these things to happen. We have a year between now and the next race to get it sorted, and we would be extremely disappointed if things have not been looked at. I am sure the local authorities are taking it seriously. People leaving the circuit are exposed and it is obvious they are at a disadvantage and that is something that needs to be addressed.”
Hamilton called on the FIA to take action. “I have been in F1 for 10 years and every year something has happened to someone in the paddock,” the world champion said. “Things should be in place to keep everyone safe and it’s for the people at the top to take action. It’s no good just the bosses or myself having security. Everyone else needs to be looked after.”


As the World Cup enters the knockout stages it is difficult to gauge the mood surrounding what should be the sport’s most important and prestigious tournament.
While things have played out largely as expected, it is the feelgood stories that will live longest in the memory. Whether it is the way Papua New Guinea have proved to be such wonderful hosts, playing in front of sellout crowds in Port Moresby, Samoa and Tonga’s spine-tingling pre-game tête-à-tête or the encouraging progress of some smaller nations, there is much to sit back and smile about.
But even here, on what ought to be the sport’s biggest stage, the first three weeks represent a microcosm of the wider problems rugby league faces. Not enough people have seen, heard or even know about the must-see moments the tournament has generated.
Will the knockout stages, beginning on Friday when the hosts and world champions Australia face Samoa, change that? Perhaps. It is inevitable that as the final approaches there will be a pick-up in interest – even if the Kangaroos saunter their way through to Brisbane on 2 December as many expect.
To only tune in now would mean you have missed those moments of encouragement that confirm what so many still believe – only with a stronger international game can rugby league begin to attract mainstream interest. The domestic game rules the roost in rugby league, and convincing the clubs more international windows are of paramount importance should be this tournament’s legacy, irrespective of the winner.
Australia v Samoa Darwin, 17 Nov (7pm/10.30am)Tonga v Lebanon Christchurch, 18 Nov (5pm/5am)NZ v Fiji Wellington, 18 Nov (7.30pm/7.30am)England v PNG Melbourne, 19 Nov (4pm/6am)
Australia have won 10 world titles including the last World Cup in 2013 (pictured). They are hot favourites to retain the trophy in Brisbane on 2 December, but are likely to face New Zealand in the first semi-final, also in Brisbane. England are seeking their first final appearance since 1995 and are expected to face surprise package Tonga in the second semi-final in Auckland.
Six northern hemisphere teams bowed out in the group stages – with the unluckiest of those undoubtedly Ireland. By far the weakest of the home nations in recent years, a swell in the number of heritage players putting up their hand to play for the Wolfhounds saw them win two of their three group games, yet they still failed to qualify from Group C.
That is another gripe about the format. Try explaining to a casual Irish sports fan why their nation failed to qualify yet Samoa, who did not win a game in the group stages, play Australia in the first quarter-final on Friday. Thankfully, the increase to 16 teams for the 2021 World Cup will ensure this convoluted nonsense is a thing of the past. Scotland and Wales were much more disappointing, although the Bravehearts at least finished with a fine draw against Samoa before heading home.
England, as expected, had enough to win against Lebanon and France to finish second behind the Kangaroos, with Papua New Guinea their opponents in Melbourne on Sunday. By the time they play, we will know the other three semi-finalists. Should Australia progress as expected, they will face the winners of New Zealand v Fiji.
Before the tournament began, it was tipped that the traditional “big three” of Australia, England and New Zealand were about to be joined by a fourth powerhouse in Tonga. Did they deliver? You bet. Their victory against the Kiwis in Hamilton last weekend to win Group B and consign New Zealand to a likely semi-final against Australia suddenly throws the complexion of the knockout stages into uncharted, exciting territory.
It will have raised a smile from England for sure, who now know they can avoid the Kiwis in the semi-finals, with either Tonga or Lebanon waiting if they see off PNG. That is surely good news, given their wretched record against New Zealand in recent times but Tonga’s emergence and England’s uninspiring performances means a first final appearance since 1995 is by no means a guarantee.
That the six teams who have been eliminated all hail from the northern hemisphere is another telling sign, too. The player pool is significantly larger south of the equator and arresting that trend will take years, maybe even decades. More importantly, it will take financial investment and a change to a schedule in Britain where there is barely time to draw breath, let alone craft out an international break for a Six Nations-style tournament to try to grow the game where it desperately needs it most.
Ironically, and not for the first time, rugby league’s biggest obstacle is none other than itself. What we have seen so far has been everything we should expect from a World Cup but the business end, on and off the field, starts here. Crucially, there could yet be a couple of twists and turns which serve as a wake-up call that maybe, just maybe, international rugby league is worth prioritising.


Most dedicated sports fans agree that governing bodies were right to support the marriage equality campaign, a survey has found.
The study by Monash University’s behavioural science laboratory and YouGov found 59% of those heavily engaged in sport (dubbed “superfans”) approved of sporting organisations’ involvement in the same-sex marriage survey debate – in which the AFL, NRL, ARU, FFA and Cricket Australia all came out in support of marriage equality.
The position of the sporting bodies during the campaign faced a chorus of public criticism, including from NRL Footy Show host Erin Nolan, her Melbourne AFL counterpart Sam Newman and News Corp journalists who persisted with the line that sport should stay out of politics.
In September Tony Abbott backed calls to ban Macklemore’s performance of the marriage equality anthem Same Love at the NRL grand final, tweeting: “Footy fans shouldn’t be subjected to a politicised grand final. Sport is sport!”
The survey revealed a much more positive view from fans, though they were divided along age lines: 71% of those between 18 and 35 agreed the sporting bodies’ move was “correct”, compared with only 56% of those between 35 and 54, and only 43% of those over 55.
However, even among those who said they “strongly disagreed” with marriage equality, 28% said they agreed the statements were important to ensure that “sporting organisations stay relevant with young people”. Overall, 62% of respondents agreed with that view.
The survey, of 1,003 respondents, also broke down the results by sporting code. Rugby union superfans were most in favour of their governing body backing marriage equality (74%), followed by football (71%), cricket (66%), rugby league (62%) and AFL (61%).
Perhaps the most surprising finding by the researchers was that Australian sporting organisations are world leaders in their approach to marriage equality. Lead researcher Erik Denison said his team had been unable to find any other examples of national sporting organisations advocating the legalisation of marriage equality. Some individual US sporting teams had done so, but none of the governing bodies.
Denison pointed out that Australian sporting organisations had led the way on LGBTI rights since 2014, when all five major governing bodies signed a commitment to eliminate homophobia in Australian sport ahead of the Bingham Cup (the world championship of gay and inclusive men and women’s rugby). In 2014-15, the five major codes also helped conduct the first international study on homophobia in sport. Subsequently, in 2016, Cricket Australia, the AFL, NRL, ARU and FFA joined forces to launch the Pride in Sport Index – a benchmarking instrument designed to assess inclusion of LGBTI people in Australian sport.
It was as a result of this history, Denison said, that fans had come to expect their codes to take a lead on political issues such as marriage equality.
“Over the last few years, Australian sporting organisations have become international leaders in efforts to tackle homophobia and make sporting culture more inclusive for LGBTI people,” he said in a statement.
“While many Australians might have been surprised to see the sports advocating for the rights of gay people to get married, this has become normal to their core fan base. This may explain why the core fans are supportive of the public stance taken by the sports”.


For a national team that has undergone drastic generational and stylistic change under Ange Postecoglou, and given the unfavourable conditions and key injuries in attack, Australia’s goalless draw with Honduras was as good a performance as could have been expected. It may also come to define the coach’s tenure.
The tie is now set up for Australia to attack when the two teams meet again on Wednesday night in Sydney. Both Postecoglou and his players have 90 minutes – or 120 – to be brave, assertive and decisive.
From making the right tactical adjustments to carrying out the plan in light of everything the Socceroos have endured, though, the must-win game at ANZ Stadium will not be straight-forward and to think Australian progression is a formality based on the first leg would be highly illogical.
Although commenting on the state of a playing surface can be deemed an ignorant grievance from football’s first world, it is a key representation of the need to adjust to the fluctuating environments of the international game.
In context, the pitch at the Estadio Olímpico Metropolitano played a primary role in the weekend’s deadlock, with a consequential effect on the performances of both teams – just as a vastly improved surface in Sydney will have an effect on Wednesday’s game.
The heavier pitch in San Pedro Sula was a visual throwback to decades ago with stretched lines and an overall slower circulation of the ball. Tellingly, the Socceroos completed their lowest number of passes over 90 minutes since the start of the AFC’s third phase of qualification at 344, along with the lowest passing accuracy (73.8%).
It was only the third time pass completion went below 80% over the same period. The common denominator away to Syria (81%), Thailand (80.5%) and Iraq (75.6%) was a heavier surface, which made Postecoglou’s high-volume passing style difficult to implement effectively.
Fundamentally, a heavier surface means passes are more difficult to weight and as such, Australia’s passing accuracy in the attacking half dramatically dropped to 64.6%. It also exposes those who are less measured with their distribution in attacking areas, and it was no surprise that Jackson Irvine (51%) and Josh Risdon (68%) finished with the lowest individual completion rates.
Initially, however, it was counteracted by those stretched defensive lines. Deployed as advanced midfielders, otherwise conservative movers in Irvine and Aaron Mooy were able to receive passes in positions where they could go forward.
Chances for Irvine and Tomi Juric in the first half were borne of this expanded space on the pitch. Although Irvine’s opening came in transition after a Massimo Luongo interception, Juric’s was particularly telling. Following Aziz Behich’s throw-in, captain Mile Jedinak was immediately able to play through the Honduran lines and if not for Juric’s profligacy – and possibly an unhelpful bobble – Australia would have had a deserved 1-0 lead.
The space Australia had to play in explains why, with much less possession and passes, they took more shots (seven) in Honduras than against Japan in August (five). Still, Australia struggled to create openings in the absence of Matthew Leckie and Robbie Kruse, and 12 total shots reflected the match. With the heavier pitch leading to chaotic positioning, play rapidly grew sloppier as collective energy from both sides dropped.
Although a collective shortage of penetration with the ball at their feet hurt the Socceroos, the hosts’ reactive game plan was also stifled. Apart from quick balls to Anthony Lozano and Alexander López in early phases of possession, Honduras offered very little in attack when that pair were on the pitch. Even after Carlo Costly and Mario Martínez came on, the state of the surface nullified the ability of Jorge Luis Pinto’s side to transition quickly and in numbers. On a better surface at ANZ, and with the suspended Alberth Elis back in the side, that is unlikely to be the case again in the return leg.




It might be a football cliche, and Australia seem to take this to the extreme, but qualification for a World Cup is never a simple task. Yet the process of qualification itself exemplifies why international football is the game’s pinnacle. On a purely tactical basis, coaches must maximise the qualities and balance of a select group of players, who in turn have to adjust to highly variable conditions.
Added to that, given the qualification phase is far more finite than a league season, the margin for error for both players and coaches is, at best, minimal. On Wednesday however, there is no room for mistakes. By attacking Honduras and “putting the pedal down” as Postecoglou put it post-match, Australia will ultimately show if they deserve to be at next year’s World Cup. Or not.


Christian Pulisic has spoken out on his dismay at USA’s failure to reach next year’s World Cup, as well as addressing the level of football talent in America.
Pulisic, who plays for Borussia Dortmund, has been able to ply his trade in the EU since he was 16 because he has dual US-Croatian citizenship. He believes it is not a lack of talent that holds US soccer back but rather a lack of opportunity.
“Why is it that EU players are allowed to move country once they turn 16 … but non-Europeans can only do so at 18?” he writes on the Players’ Tribune. “Why aren’t we campaigning for a level playing field, where our best 16 year olds – who may not have an EU passport like I had – are free to move when they turn 16, like the best young players in Europe can? And in the meanwhile, as long as some of our best young players aren’t getting the opportunity like I had to go to Europe when they’re 16 … are we doing everything in our power to make sure the level of play in US soccer is high enough so that they can continue to develop up to their maximum potential?
In his article, Pulisic plays down comments from people who see him as the saviour of US soccer: “I’m not a prodigy – or a ‘wonderboy,’ as some have put it.” Instead, while conceding he was born with some natural talent, he says that his experience of going to Europe young helped him develop.
“In the US system, too often the best player on an under-17 team will be treated like a ‘star’ – not having to work for the ball, being the focus of the offense at all times, etc – at a time when they should be having to fight tooth and nail for their spot,” writes Pulisic.
“In Europe, on the other hand, the average level of ability around you is just so much higher. It’s a pool of players where everyone has been ‘the best player,’ and everyone is fighting for a spot – truly week in and week out. Which makes the intensity and humility that you need to bring to the field every day – both from a mental and physical perspective – just unlike anything that you can really experience in US developmental soccer. Without those experiences, there’s simply no way that I would be at anywhere close to the level that I am today.”
Pulisic concedes leaving behind a support network in the US is not the right decision for everyone but raises concerns about opportunities for young players in America. “It really does frustrate me, when I watch MLS, and I see our best U-17 players – who, again, are so talented and so capable – being rostered … but then not being put on the field much to actually play. I watch that, and I just think about how I was given a chance … a real chance … and it changed my life.”
Living in Germany, Pulisic has seen the effects a World Cup can have on a culture in which football is the dominant sport. “If your city’s club team is having success, or if your national team is having success, there’s just this amazing sense of personal pride that comes with it. I saw a spark of that [with Clint Dempsey’s goal against Ghana at the 2014 World Cup] — it almost felt like that one moment changed the mood of the entire country. And it’s hard to put into words how powerful that is. Which is why I feel so crushed that we won’t be giving people that feeling this summer.”
Pulisic, who turned 19 in September, will have many more opportunities to play in World Cups, and ends his article on a positive note. “I think – I hope – that we’re going to be able to build something, here, with US Soccer, where it’s not just going to be about one lost match, or one lost cycle, or one lost team. It’s going to be about an entire country, rallying around an entire sport, in a way that lasts. So let’s plan on it, then – 2022 ... We’ll be there.”
US Soccer told the Guardian they did not have a comment on Pulisic’s article.


The year 1958 featured several milestones. The EEC came into being. The first successful American satellite, Explorer 1 was launched into orbit. Women were allowed sit in the House of Lords for the first time. Milestones, the studio album by jazz trumpeting’s self-styled Prince of Darkness, Miles Davis was released and for the first time Italy failed to qualify for the World Cup. Back then, Gian Piero Ventura was nowt but a fresh-faced 10-year-old gadding about the streets of Genoa, who would have had no idea that almost six decades later he’d be within 90 minutes of masterminding what would be only his country’s second ever failure to qualify for a World Cup.
Having been comprehensively outplayed and beaten by a fairly mediocre Sweden side in Stockholm, Italy have a job on their hands to overturn their 1-0 first-leg deficit in Milan on Monday night. And having bamboozled his stereotypically excitable compatriots with a series of baffling formations and team selections since replacing Antonio Conte, Ventura appears to have been inundated with no end of unsolicited offers of help. “I’ve received so much advice in the past few days that, if I tried to listen to it all, it would take months,” he parped. “I know that’s how it works when you are coach of the national team although I didn’t expect it to be quite like this.”
Despite having signed a two-year contract extension shortly before sending his team out to get slaughtered by Spain in the qualifiers playing a 4-2-4 formation, speculation abounds in Italy that Ventura will have plenty of spare time to belatedly listen to all this advice. More than one Italian newspaper has reported that he will be sacked even if Italy manage to scrape past Sweden, with Carlo Ancelotti and his amazingly quizzical eyebrow the nation’s preferred choice to fix whatever mess is left this time tomorrow. But while the prevailing mood in Italy is one of pessimistic panic, at least they still have a chance of qualifying for Russia. That’s more than can be said for Norn Iron Nil, whose chances of qualifying for their first finals since 1986 were ultimately dashed by a goal scored from a penalty even their Swiss opposition had the good grace to seem fairly embarrassed to be awarded.
One publication described it as “a beautiful present from the referee” Ovidiu Hategan, who was roundly disparaged on social media in slightly more colourful, politically incorrect and racially abusive terms by Lisa Evans, the wife of defender Corry, who was incorrectly penalised for the handball that led to the Swiss spot-kick. Evans subsequently apologised “unreservedly” for his wife’s outburst, while his other half has also sort of said sorry. In even more depressing news for Norn Iron Nil fans, the odds on their manager Michael O’Neill abandoning ship have since been slashed to ribbons with a machete. Highly regarded and based in Edinburgh, O’Neill is now the even-money favourite to take over the vacant Scotland job. It would appear that having sampled World Cup heartbreak, he has quickly developed a taste for it and despite the best attempts of Norn Iron and Italy, nobody quite does it like the Scots.

“I used to get annoyed when people said things about me that weren’t true … It went like this: ‘Uh, this guy likes rock and roll, so he must like whisky, and on top of that he smokes. He must be drinking whisky until five in the morning, and I’m sure that he takes drugs, too … No, brother, I’m not Messi. I wouldn’t have been able to get out of bed if I did all that. I still have to go to bed early, eat salad and rest well … Afterwards, of course I like to drink whisky, smoke a cigarette and do rock and roll” – Dani Osvaldo, last seen having retired from football in order to focus on his “music career”, denies spending his days drinking and smoking by pointing out, erm, he likes a drink and a smoke.

The busy intersection of 25th Avenue and Steinway Street was completely shut down due to the mass of people chanting, singing, cheering and screaming. Flags were waving high above the crowds as the police simply sat and watched. This wasn’t a riot, though; this was a party. Egypt had just qualified for their first World Cup since 1990 and in the Little Egypt of New York that was cause for celebration.
It’s always special when a nation returns to the peak of their sport after a long leave of absence. People at home and abroad unite, like they did a month ago when Mohamed Salah sealed Egypt’s place at the World Cup with a 2-1 win over Congo with his coolly taken penalty kick. Egypt finished their qualifying campaign over the weekend with a 1-1 draw in Ghana but that 95th-minute winner was the moment their fans had been waiting for.
Egypt have not been to a World Cup for 27 years, but it hasn’t always been for a lack of talent. They have won the Africa Cup of Nations four times since their previous World Cup appearance and their absence has partly been tied to political upheaval. Two domestic seasons were cancelled between 2011 and 2013 following the Port Said Stadium disaster, and the 2013 coup d’état didn’t help settle things down.
Egypt are the most successful team in Africa Cup of Nations history, and they won three successive tournaments in 2006, 2008 and 2010, but the Arab Spring in 2011 changed everything. They didn’t even qualify for the three tournaments following the revolution. It’s hard to hold together something as trivial as sport when the nation itself is crumbling.
Through these years of triumphs and disasters, there have been very few constants for Egyptian football. Coaches have been hired and fired; seasons have come and gone, some completed and some abandoned; and competitions have been won, lost or not entered at all. But there has always been one man standing there, gloves on, ready for the next challenge. And that man is 44-year-old goalkeeper Essam El-Hadary.
El-Hadary made his international debut in 1996, when some of his current team-mates were not even born. He was there when his country dominated Africa in the 2000s and when their prospects of fielding a successful side were derailed a few years later. He has earned 156 caps and won the African Cup of Nations four times, being picked as goalkeeper of the tournament in 2006, 2008 and 2010. And earlier this year, two days after his 44th birthday, he became the oldest player to appear in the Cup of Nations.
El-Hadary does not have long left in the game but he knows exactly what he wants to achieve with what time he has left. “I did almost everything in my footballing career,” he said earlier this year. “I won 37 trophies and I enjoyed some remarkable moments, such as our win over Italy at the 2009 Confederations Cup. The only thing that is missing for me is a World Cup appearance.” Now he has his ticket.
He was in goal for Egypt when Salah scored the winner at the Borg El-Arab Stadium last month. If he stays injury-free and retains his place, he will become the oldest player to feature at a World Cup, breaking a record last set by Colombian goalkeeper Faryd Mondragon in 2014. El-Hadary is determined to break the record in style. He isn’t a relic the team bring along for sentimentality’s sake, a veteran who is picked to be good in the dressing room and around the hotel. He started and captained Egypt throughout their qualifying campaign, only standing aside in the final fixture as their place in Russia was already secured. He is not waiting to make a cameo at the World Cup and then retire. He hopes to play into his 50s.
El-Hadary’s successes with Egypt stretch back to 1998, when he was in the squad that won the Cup of Nations. He was also on the bench in 2000, but that would be the last of this sitting business; El-Hadary was ready to stand up and play. In his first Cup of Nations as a starter, in 2002, Egypt were narrowly defeated in the quarter-finals by soon-to-be-champions Cameroon. El-Hadary finally earned his winners’ medal in 2006, just as he would do in 2008 and 2010.
With the World Cup coming to Africa for the first time in 2010, Egypt should have been one of the contenders. But, after making it to the third round of qualifying and finding themselves tied in their group with Algeria, they had to play a one-off tiebreaker in Sudan. They lost 1-0 despite launching waves of attack after conceding the opening – and only – goal of the game.
The next few years were difficult for Egypt and El-Hadary. He turned 40 in 2013 and seemed to be drifting away from the national side. When the current World Cup qualifying campaign began, he had only won five caps in three years, but he kept working and was picked for Egypt’s first two qualifiers in late 2016. Egypt won them both and El-Hadary kept his place for the rest of the campaign – and the Cup of Nations earlier this year, when he pulled off more heroics.
Going into the tournament, El-Hadary had not surrendered a goal in the Cup of Nations since 2010. That run continued through the group stages, through their quarter-final and into the semi-final against Burkina Faso, where a 73rd-minute strike by Aristide Bancé ended the 653 scoreless minutes El-Hadary had carried with him over seven years of Afcon play.
There was no time for him to mourn the end of his streak, though. The game went to penalties and, with Egypt in danger of losing the shootout, he had to do something. El-Hadry did what was asked of him, saving two penalties in a row to send Egypt to the final. They were beaten by Cameroon in the final, but all is not lost: Egypt still have the World Cup, where El-Hadary will hopefully break a record or two and accomplish a lifelong dream.

Wales have recalled Jamie Roberts to provide midfield cover for Jonathan Davies after the Lions’ player of the series in New Zealand suffered an ankle injury in the closing minutes of the defeat by Australia.
Wales did not issue an update on Davies’s condition but ankle ligament damage is suspected and Warren Gatland said on Saturday that the injury “did not look good.”
The only direct replacement for Davies, an outside-centre, in the squad is Owen Watkin, the 21-year old Osprey who won his first cap against Australia when he replaced Owen Williams 12 minutes from the end.
If Davies is ruled out for the rest of the series, which continues with Georgia on Saturday before New Zealand and South Africa roll up to the Principality Stadium, Gatland has the option of playing Scott Williams, an inside-centre by preference, at 13 having used Owen Williams as a second playmaker at 12 against the Wallabies.
“We’re still waiting on Jon,” said the skills coach Neil Jenkins. “Everyone saw it and it doesn’t look great. He’s going to struggle for the rest of this autumn but we hope it’s not too serious. I’m not saying he’s out but we just need to see where he’s at. He was outstanding for the Lions and last year for us. He’s world-class but Jamie will fit in naturally, an outstanding player who was unlucky to miss out originally.”
The 31-year old Roberts, who captained Wales on their summer tour to Tonga and Samoa, was dropped from the squad last month for the first time since Gatland took over at the end of 2007. The 93-cap Harlequin was told it did not herald the end of his international career but he would not have anticipated such a quick return.
“I am disappointed but understand the reasons why,” said Roberts last week when asked about his omission. “I will keep doing what I do best and hope that, come the Six Nations, I get another shot.”
The Bath prop Scott Andrews also reported for training on Monday morning. He was brought in as cover with Samson Lee, who missed the match against Australia, struggling with an achilles tendon problem.
Andrews is on loan at Bath from Cardiff Blues, which would lead to a poser if he is needed for the final match of the series against South Africa next month. The game falls outside the official international window and clubs are not obliged to release players.
The tighthead Tomas Francis will return to Exeter but it is a matter for negotiation whether Andrews would be covered by Premiership Rugby’s blanket ban on players being released for fourth internationals.
Wales expect two of their summer Lions who missed the Australia match through injury, the scrum-half Rhys Webb and the flanker Justin Tipuric, to be available for selection this weekend.
“They will enhance our side if they are ready,” Jenkins said. “It’s going to be tough against Georgia. They’re big and physical with a strong set piece and driving lineout. We want to carry on from the good things we did on Saturday and go to another level. We’re trying to play with intent and have fantastic players who are comfortable with ball in hand. With the backs we’ve got, we’d be silly not to let them play the natural Wales way.”
Sam Warburton says he has had “no hiccups so far” in his recovery from neck surgery. The twice British and Irish Lions captain remains on course for a return to action in January. Wales open their Six Nations campaign against Scotland on 3 February.
Warburton has not played so far this season after the recurrence of a long-standing neck injury meant an operation was deemed necessary. “I had the operation six weeks ago now, and it is a four-month return to play, which is January,” he said. “The rehab is going smoothly so far, so all good.”


Celtic and Manchester United have expressed support for their former midfielder Liam Miller after it emerged that the 36-year-old has pancreatic cancer. The former Republic of Ireland player, who won 21 caps for the Republic between 2004 and 2009, has reportedly received treatment in the US, where he last played for Wilmington Hammerheads.
Celtic wrote on Twitter: “The thoughts and prayers of everyone at Celtic Football Club are with Liam Miller and his family at this time.” Manchester United said: “The thoughts of everyone at Manchester United go out to Liam Miller and his loved ones at this difficult time.” Another of his former clubs, Sunderland, also tweeted in support. The Republic of Ireland manager Martin O’Neill added that the news “puts things in perspective”.
“I gave him his debut at Celtic,” O’Neill said. “He did wonderfully well in a Champions League game one evening, he was absolutely outstanding. We heard about the news recently but we didn’t know how bad it was. All thoughts go out to him and his family. I think he has three children as well. Such a young man.”
The Ireland midfielder David Meyler said: “Thoughts go out to him and his family, from the whole team. We’re thinking about him and we hope he can pull through.”
Miller’s former Ireland team-mate Noel Hunt wrote on Twitter: “Such sad news about my old room-mate Liam Miller, Pray to God he pulls through this battle with cancer, my thoughts and prayers are with him and his family.”
Miller made his professional debut for Celtic in 2000 after coming through the youth ranks at Parkhead and helped them win the Scottish Premier League title in 2004.
He then moved to United on a free transfer, making 22 appearances under Sir Alex Ferguson in two seasons – which included a spell on loan at Leeds – before joining Sunderland in 2006.
Miller was part of the Sunderland squad that won promotion to the Premier League in 2007 but moved again in 2009, this time to QPR. A short spell at Loftus Road was followed by stints at Hibernian, the Australian clubs Perth Glory, Brisbane Roar and Melbourne City, his home-town club Cork City and, most recently, Wilmington.
Many of his former clubs and colleagues have publicly expressed their support for Miller through social media.
John Hartson, who played alongside Miller at Celtic, tweeted: “My thoughts are with Liam Miller and his family this morning. Hope he can get through this difficult time of his life.”
Jacob Burns, the former Leeds and Australia midfielder who is now head of football at Perth Glory, tweeted: “In shock! Thoughts and prayers are with my old team Mate and friend Liam Miller as he and his beautiful family fight through this battle!”
Meyler said the current Ireland squad are thinking about their compatriot. “Obviously we heard the news, we’re unsure about the details, but our thoughts go out to his family and we’re just thinking about him and we just hope he can pull through and he’s strong. That’s from the whole team and everyone.”


The company which owns Leicester City and funded their rise to become the 2015‑16 Premier League champions is to face multimillion-pound corruption charges in Thailand. A judge at the central court for corruption and misconduct cases ruled at a hearing on Monday that criminal allegations presented in July should go ahead against King Power, the cash-rich company owned and run by the Leicester chairman, Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha, and his son Aiyawatt.
King Power is accused of having corruptly short-changed the Thai government of 14bn baht (£327m), its agreed share from the company’s lucrative duty-free monopoly at Bangkok’s Suvarnabhumi airport.
The lawsuit, filed by Charnchai Issarasenarak, the former deputy chairman of a government anti-corruption subcommittee, alleges King Power and one of its executives colluded with airport employees to pay the government only a 3% slice of the duty-free revenues. The original 2006 grant to King Power of the franchise, at one of the world’s busier airports, required 15% of the income to be paid to the government, according to the charges.
King Power said in July that if the case was brought to trial it would be vigorously defended. The judge has accepted that it should proceed against 14 Airport of Thailand officials, three King Power companies and one company official. The chief operating officer of King Power International, also the group vice-chairman, Sombat Dechapanichkul, is the King Power executive charged personally. Vichai and Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha are not personally named as defendants.
In her ruling the judge said: “From the examination of the lawsuit the court sees the case is within the authority of the central court for corruption and misconduct case, and the lawsuit is in accordance with … the procedures for corruption and malfeasance case act.”
King Power is understood to have filed a libel lawsuit against Charnchai in February this year, claiming defamation in statements he made alleging corruption before his criminal petition against the company reached the court. Charnchai could not be reached for comment.
King Power bought Leicester City for a reported £39m when the club were in the Championship in 2010, then loaned them more than £100m to sign players and bankroll wages and losses, an investment that paid off spectacularly when they surprisingly won the Premier League title 18 months ago.
Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha established King Power in 1989 with one small shop in Bangkok, then gained access to major wealth when his company was granted the exclusive franchise for duty-free sales at Suvarnabhumi airport. At the time the prime minister was Thaksin Shinawatra, who was ousted in a military coup soon afterwards and fled the country. Thaksin bought Manchester City in 2007 then sold them after a year to Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed al-Nahyan of the Abu Dhabi ruling family. In Thailand the military, Thaksin’s bitter rival, remain in charge.
The prosecution and defence in the criminal case will now submit further evidence and lists of witnesses to be heard, with suggestions the case may come to trial in March. In the original lawsuit, Charnchai listed the current prime minister of Thailand, General Prayuth Chan-ocha, as the second witness.
King Power responded to the court’s decision with a statement from Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha as the chief executive of the company and Leicester City vice-chairman: “The allegations in question have yet to be accepted by the court and are categorically denied. King Power has always followed and been absolutely committed to the highest standards in proper and ethical business practice. We are proud of our company’s good name and honest reputation and will fight rigorously any attempts to discredit them.”
It is not clear whether the case would have any impact on Leicester City if it proceeds and is proven. Premier League rules prohibit people from owning more than 30% or being a director of a club if they have been convicted of a criminal offence of dishonesty, but there is no precedent for companies involved in club ownership, rather than individuals, being charged.


A lot of stiff, sore bodies will be hauled into team meetings this Monday, as the coaches run their weekend debriefings after the first full round of the autumn internationals. The Irish will be feeling that much better about themselves than everyone else. Nothing soothes a player’s aches and pains quite like a famous victory, and their 38-3 win against South Africa was a resounding result, the statement performance of the weekend. The only time a European team have beaten South Africa by more than that was when England hammered them 53-3 in 2002. That was back when the side that went on to win the World Cup was in its pomp, and the Springboks played most of the game with 14 men because Jannes Labuschagne had been sent off.
Like everyone else, Ireland are using this autumn series to fold some new players into the team as they look to build their strength in depth before the 2019 World Cup. Joe Schmidt seemed a little anxious about it before the match. “It’s a new group,” he said, “and an opportunity to mix those guys and hopefully get as much cohesion as we can in a short period of time.” He need not have fretted. Ireland looked a little rusty at first, and made a few too many errors when they had the ball in hand, but they came together as the game wore on. And in those last 10 minutes, when they scored three fine tries, they were positively purring along, looking formidably good.
South Africa’s failure to deal with Ireland’s kicking game was predictable enough, since their head coach, Allister Coetzee, spoke about how worried he was for his inexperienced back three before the match. But it was a surprise to see the Springboks get bullied in the scrums, lineouts and breakdowns, where they still seemed to be adjusting to the new laws. Ireland were ranked fourth in the world at the start of the week, two spots back from England, but going on the weekend’s showing, on top of their victory against England last March, they look the best side in Europe right now, and a match for anyone when they are playing at home.
As for England, you guess Eddie Jones’s real feelings about the victory over Argentina were the curses he let fly at his side during the match – “how fucking stupid are we?” – rather than the bromides he offered up to the press after it. Jones said himself that his new midfield combination of George Ford, Henry Slade, and Jonathan Joseph just didn’t catch light. And apart from the bullocking runs of Nathan Hughes, who had a barnstorming game at No8, England just didn’t seem to break the gainline often enough to get any momentum into their attacks, at least until Alex Lozowski came off the bench, and gave some thrust to that backline.
Jones was not the only one feeling frustrated. For the first time in a long time, the Twickenham crowd turned on their team, and there were a lot of exasperated fans shouting out in frustration. Like Schmidt, Jones is trying to bring fringe players through so that he has two or three men competing for every position, but right now it feels like the intense focus and understanding the team had during their run of 18 wins in a row is beginning to dissipate. Jones will surely bring Owen Farrell and Maro Itoje back into the team for Saturday’s match against Australia, to get the side up and running in earnest again.
Over in Wales, meanwhile, Warren Gatland’s plans seem to be even more ambitious. Sam Warburton, who was commentating for the BBC, said Saturday’s match was “the biggest change he’s seen” to the team since he joined it.
Gatland and Rob Howley want to overhaul the way Wales play. The key difference is that they’ve brought in Owen Williams as a second playmaker at inside centre. Williams and Dan Biggar kept switching with each other at first receiver, a tactic Gatland hasn’t really used since he had James Hook and Gavin Henson playing together way back in 2008.
It worked well in patches, like when Williams and Biggar whipped the ball across field with a series of flat, flittering passes to set up a three-on-one overlap for Steff Evans’s try. But Wales looked even rustier than England did earlier in the afternoon, and made too many costly mistakes against an Australian side sharply honed by recent victories against the All Blacks and Japan. You guess the Welsh are going to get a stiff dressing down from Shaun Edwards over the way they defended, as will the Scots from Matt Taylor. At least all those missed tackles made for a couple of entertaining matches.
Still, if they are going to commit to playing this way, the Welsh have more room to improve than any other side in Europe, except, perhaps, the French, who showed a few glimpses of the good stuff in the second half of their defeat to New Zealand. Two years out from the World Cup, the competition is already hotting up.


In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, swimming was a spectator sport. Onlookers lined the edges of municipal swimming baths to watch feats of endurance swimming, “underwater ballets”, and to marvel at high dives. Celebrities such as Captain Matthew Webb, fresh from conquering the English Channel, and Annette Kellermann, later dubbed the Million Dollar Mermaid, thrilled the crowds.
Step forward in time to 2017 and my visit to Thames Lido. I am here in a beautifully refurbished Edwardian swimming pool, swimming up and down what is effectively a glass box, as people sit eating their breakfast behind a vast glass wall. I splash around in front of them feeling like I’m back in a different time. Every now and again diners look up from their cappuccinos and lazily cast their eyes towards the water – and me.
It feels a slightly amusing juxtaposition. As I swim, I wonder if maybe I should be doing something more entertaining: a few handstands perhaps, or some synchronised swimming, a demonstration of the Australian Crawl? Instead I’m a sensibly clad “serious” swimmer complete with cap and goggles, sauntering up and down with a lazy front crawl – up and down, up and down. I’d feel much more self conscious if I didn’t know that I am undoubtedly having a better time than they are.
Thames Lido is special. The lidos we know and love in the UK, built mostly in the 1930s, are generally expansive and spacious. They have room for sunbathing and socialising, wide vistas and low walls. And redolent of ocean liners, they let in light and sun and fresh air and are for crowds and cavorting. They speak of holidays and sunshine and sociability and fitness.
However, this place – once the Ladies Swimming Baths in Reading’s Kings Meadow, built in 1902 – is surprisingly different. It was designed in a less showy era, as a haven for private women-only swimming. It was a secluded and closed affair: with red brick walls two storeys high, with no windows to allow outsiders to peer in. The lido walls wrap the pool like arms protectively encircling a secret heart.
Having heard about the opening, I was initially sceptical. I love the idea of the democracy of swimming. I love public pools and lidos. I was prepared to sneer and moan about the place and my swim, about elitism and snobbery – as many critics of this place have already.
But as soon as I walked in the front door, I fell in love. I swam at 7.30 in the morning, alone, on a grey rainy day, in the clean fresh water of the 25m, blue-italian-tile-clad infinity pool, in the glass walled courtyard. Steam gently rose from the water, which is heated to a cool 25C – perfect for swimming. I thought it might feel chilly, but there was no wind in this protected courtyard. It has a beautiful outside-yet-inside vibe: nestled away, while overhead the sky and the leafy tops of tall trees peeked over the walls. Every now and again a gust of wind would catch the branches and a few autumn leaves would flutter down delicately into the space and scatter themselves artfully on the pool. I was in heaven.
The Thames Lido team has done a great job. The facility had fallen into disrepair after years of neglect by local councils. Unused since its closure in 1974, the lido’s future hung in the balance until the team behind Bristol Lido rescued it. After discovering it in 2012, they began the painstaking refurbishment of the grade II listed building, finally opening the doors last month. The restoration has been sympathetic; the showers, the massage rooms and the sauna facilities are straightforward and have a quirky Scandi feel to them – as does the “shower naked” policy that swimmers are encouraged to adopt before they swim. The poolside restaurant is airy and bright, the food delicious.
As I’m shown around the place, Mark Thwaites, one of the directors of the company behind the Lido, refers to the place as a “lee-do”. When I ask him about his preference for lee-do over lie-do, he describes his childhood memories spent playing in Guildford lido (very much a british lie-do) – all floating plasters and kids splashing and soggy sandwiches. He likes to think that Thames Lido has a more glamorous European vibe to it, hence the pronunciation. I see where he is coming from: it’s a grown-up version of a lido, a place to feel pampered and cosseted, to relax and retreat, and to be well fed, a million miles away from the every day.


Eddie Hearn’s invasion of America was not quite on a par with that of Colin Welland, who led the Chariots of Fire charge at the 1982 Oscars with his “The British Are Coming” battlecry – but it was good enough for Daniel “Miracle Man” Jacobs.
The New York middleweight with a back story that would have delighted the late British scriptwriter kept his story rolling in the Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum in his hometown on Saturday night, comfortably seeing off the quality challenge of the previously unbeaten Luís Arias over 12 rounds that never approached the drama of Jacobs’s fight with Gennady Golovkin in the more prestigious Madison Square Garden last March.
That performance persuaded Hearn that here was a fighter – who’d beaten cancer and came close to beating a legend – who would be his passport into the American big-time. It might yet prove to be so.
After winning, the articulate and likeable Jacobs told Max Kellerman in the ring that Hearn is manoeuvering him into a long-term rematch with Golovkin – or Saul “Canelo” Álvarez if the Mexican wins their own return next year. And the route to that payday looks like it could be through Britain’s Billy Joe Saunders.
Saunders defends his WBO title against the battle-worn but dangerous David Lemieux in the Place Bell, Laval, Canada, on 16 December, and Jacobs says: “We’re gonna invade Montreal. We’re gonna make sure that we’re ringside so that those guys see my face and then call them out afterwards. I’ve already made it clear through social media that I want to fight the both of those guys.”
One of them would do. Boxing is all about a timetable and, fighting a manageable three times a year is what elite performers aim at, because each bout is also a major event, taking months rather than weeks to sell to a pay-per-view audience.
“He had a great performance against Golovkin,” Hearn said of Jacobs ringside on Sky. “Should have been in the ring earlier, but that’s OK – he got 12 rounds in the bank. It’s so important for a fighter to know the plan, not to come out of the ring and wait three months to know when you’re fighting next. We’re boxing in April – very, very simple – probably the weekend before Cinco de Mayo for Golovkin against Canelo. We’ve already been speaking to the Barclay Center in Brooklyn and HBO. We plan effectively. He can have Christmas with his family, then straight back to the gym.”
All of which puts Saunders, promoted by Frank Warren, into the frame for negotiations with Hearn’s fighter. That should give all of them a few tasty challenges to unravel over the negotiating table.
Hearn, meanwhile, is holding the line on Anthony Joshua’s 2018 schedule. He wants Joseph Parker in London in March, and should be encouraged by his correspondence with David Higgins, the New Zealander’s hard-bargaining promoter. Higgins understands the three-belt champion Joshua is a bigger draw than his WBO titleholder, so will accept less than 50%. How much less could be the deal breaker.
And Deontay Wilder is still waving his WBC belt around as if it is the main prize in the heavyweight division, playing his part in the hype by saying Hearn is scared to put his cash cow in the ring with him. Hearn does have reservations – just as he did before Joshua fought Wladimir Klitschko – and says it is his fighter who is keenest to take these risky fights.
As a fan, Hearn wants to see Joshua‑Wilder; as a businessman, he wants to see the American first make some money for all of them by sharing a ring with the Londoner Dillian Whyte in February – which Wilder, with some justification, regards as an unnecessary audition for the main event. Nevertheless, it makes good business sense for all of them; Wilder still needs to ramp up his marketing presence in the UK before he shares a ring with Joshua – who has drawn a phenomenal 158,000 fans through the turnstiles in his past two appearances.
One thing looks locked in: Joshua-Wilder will not happen in America, whatever Hearn’s ambitions are over there. As he told me after Joshua stopped Carlos Takam in Cardiff, the big money remains in the UK – although long term the United States will be the place to go. And that is why he signed Jacobs.
The Tartan Tornado, Josh Taylor, continues to live up to his nom de guerre and his risk-and-reward strategy paid off when he stopped the seasoned Mexican Miguel Vázquez in the ninth of 12 rounds for the WBC’s “Silver” light-welterweight title in Edinburgh on Saturday night.
Barry McGuigan took an undeniable hit when Carl Frampton left his Cyclone Promotions set-up recently, but he has a star of obvious pedigree in the Scottish fighter.
Across the promotional landscape, there are British champions and contenders delivering consistently good performances, and the two Liams, Smith and Williams, did their best to reprise the drama of their first fight when they met again in Newcastle. However, as BoxNation’s John Rawling rightly described it, the rematch was, “bit of a chess match” – and that is so often the case.
When two fighters of similar ability sort each other out the first time, they rarely make the same mistakes twice and that can lead to excess caution. On Saturday night Smith won again, this time 117-112, 116-112, 114-114. Williams will reckon the drawn verdict was closer to reality than the other scores, and quite a few would agree with him. I thought Smith deserved it.
One rematch that should not disappoint is that between Tony Bellew and David Haye, who are relocking horns on 17 December at the O2 Arena in London. Bellew is relaxed with what he has achieved – starring in a movie and reproducing his deeds in real life – while Haye, for years the most exciting heavyweight in the division, remains frustratingly short of the defining performance he needs to round out his interesting career. That is a recipe for a great fight.


When Brazil emerge from the Wembley tunnel to face England on Tuesday evening most eyes will be on Neymar, Gabriel Jesus and the array of dazzling talent wrapped in canary yellow. Back in Brazil, the focus will be elsewhere. Adenor Leonardo Bacchi, better known as Tite – pronounced “Cheechee” – is revered in his homeland. The 56-year-old has restored the country’s pride in its national side and that counts for a lot in image‑conscious Brazil.
“Tite is a great coach, one of the best in the world. He just doesn’t have the status of [Pep] Guardiola and [José] Mourinho because he’s not in Europe. But he’s as good as these guys,” says the former Brazil international Neto, a pundit for the broadcaster Bandeirantes.
Tite took charge in June last year after Brazil went out of the Copa América and were floundering in sixth place in the South America qualifiers. He engineered a remarkable turnaround: in March, Brazil became the first team to qualify for Russia. The Seleção’s old swagger is back, but now it is underpinned by a sizable chunk of pragmatism.
Brazil are still in the process of reinventing themselves after their 7-1 humiliation against Germany at the 2014 World Cup was followed by two years of torpor under Dunga. Tite once said: “A coach has to know his machine … how much it can take, the way it works, know which parts you can be harder on.” Brazil are changing and, in Tite, have a man who has morphed from mechanic to magus.
In the space of 18 months, Tite has restored the spirit that had evaporated under Dunga; now he is working on bringing back some of the old magic. “What fascinates me most is the Brazil of 1982. They played almost without thinking,” he says. “That side was so impressive. Falcao, Socrates, Cerezo and Zico. I look at that team and I think what a beautiful thing it is to play football.”
Fine words, but make no mistake, Tite is cut from the same cloth as his predecessors Dunga and, Tite’s mentor, Luiz Felipe Scolari. Today’s Brazil are a far cry from the futebol arte of the 80s.
Tite is from Caxias do Sul in the south of Brazil. Down to earth and conservative, his critics argue that his pronouncements on football – and life – are somewhat preachy, but he makes light of the puritanical image he has helped create. The overall impression is that Tite is a good man, someone you can trust, a man you would want to play for. He is loyal to his players, but a lack of ruthlessness cost him in the past and could do so again in Russia.
His playing career was cut short due to injury and the former defensive midfielder started his first coaching position in 1990 for Guarany de Garibaldi. Eleven years later, he got a crack at the big time with Grêmio and won the Copa do Brasil. There followed a series of jobs patching up struggling teams, saving them from the drop, before inevitably getting the sack. His Mr Fix It image changed after he won the Copa Sudamericana with Internacional in 2008. However, the real turning point came two years later when he joined Corinthians for a second time.
Tite rebuilt the side from the back and they went on to win the league, conceding just 36 goals in 38 games. Seven months later they beat Boca Juniors in the Libertadores final, and in the same year saw off Chelsea in the Fifa Club World Cup.
But in 2013, Corinthians stagnated and clocked up a staggering 13 goalless draws over the season. In November, the club told the coach he was out. The problem, according to Neto, was clear. “One of his weaknesses is making difficult changes, like dropping players he trusts. He struggled with this after winning the Club World Cup. It needed [his successor] Mano Menezes to do a clear-out.”
While Menezes was spring cleaning, Tite went on a sabbatical. The coach had always been a student of the game, now he had time to pay a few calls. One of Brazil’s top football analysts, Paulo Vinícius Coelho, better known as PVC, believes this period was crucial to Tite’s development as a coach. “Tite has studied the best training methods around the world for more than a decade and applied what he learned. But he didn’t copy, he adapted. This happened especially after he left Corinthians and spent time with Carlo Ancelotti and Zinedine Zidane.”
Midway through his year out, Brazil suffered the ignominy of being thrashed by Germany at a World Cup they were hosting. Tite was favourite to take over from Scolari. Instead, Dunga got the call and was back in charge.
By the end of the season, Tite had returned to Corinthians and picked up another league title in 2015. He finally got the Brazil job in June last year and his record has been impressive: 12 wins, two draws, and one defeat, in a friendly against Argentina.
The results have come though the changes have not been radical. Tite has made full use of the experience in his squad and exploited the pace and flair going forward. The Liverpool coach Michael Beale worked in Brazil and believes Tite’s side have a balanced look. “Neymar, Gabriel Jesus and Philippe Coutinho are a formidable attacking force. The team has strength and mobility in midfield and the natural Brazilian style of full-backs Dani Alves and Marcelo gives them attacking versatility in wide areas. The one big question for me is that because they’ve used a very settled group of players, the team could be short of ideas if things go wrong or they get hit by injuries or suspensions.”
Tite admits dropping players distresses him. “It makes me uncomfortable. I want to be as fair as possible. There can be only 23 players. I’m going to do an injustice to someone. I know players think: ‘I deserve to be in’. It’s the human side [of the job] that bothers me most.”
Dealing with his emotions will be a challenge. With Argentina struggling in the qualifiers, there is a sense that Brazil had it relatively easy in reaching Russia. Bigger tests will come from the top European sides that move the ball quickly in midfield. That could prove difficult for Casemiro, Renato Augusto and Paulinho, solid players but not the fastest. Tite thrives on getting the best out of the talent available to him. “The essence of a great coach is someone who can make the most of his team,” he says. “It’s the coach who has to adapt his style to fit the side, not the other way round.”
With so many stars, it is arguable the Brazil job is more about man-management than tactics. Coelho agrees. “Tite doesn’t speak English but uses Edu Gaspar [once of Arsenal] to understand coaches such as Liverpool’s Jürgen Klopp, who work with Brazilians.
“Tite talks to his players every day and sends videos and analysis on WhatsApp. He’s very different from previous Brazil coaches. He spends 10 hours a day at the Brazilian Football Confederation analysing his players. Tite runs the Seleção as if it were a club side. In just over a year, the relationship with the players and the system has changed. And, the results have come from this.”


Owen Farrell will return to the England team against Australia on Saturday; the question is where. Eddie Jones played Henry Slade at 12 against Argentina but with a lack of quick ball, the Exeter centre was a marginal figure. The head coach has the option of restoring Farrell to inside-centre and moving Slade to 13, where he has excelled for the Chiefs this season, or putting Farrell at 10 in place of George Ford, who is not at his most effective when weighed down with slow possession. The decision should be made in conjunction with ball-carrying options at forward. Jones has looked for a balance between set-piece proficiency and presence in the loose, but if he puts the lack of dynamism in attack down to something more than rust, Jamie George and Harry Williams come into focus and Maro Itoje’s return would allow Courtney Lawes to move back to the back row. If Jones acts in anger, there will be a shake-up, but he is one who counts to 10 before selecting. What is evident is that when England are without the pillars of Farrell, Itoje and Billy Vunipola, their foundations shake.

Ireland’s margin of victory over South Africa may have been embellished by three tries in the final nine minutes, but there was no denying their marked superiority over opponents who were as green as their jerseys. The naivety of the Springboks’ back three was exposed by the kicking of Jonathan Sexton, who was at his most ruthlessly efficient. South Africa, despite having a rule that allows the national head coach to pick expats who have won 30 caps or more, have this year largely stuck with players who play for one of their Super Rugby franchises. This was partly a move to stem the flow to Europe, but in Dublin they played the Bath flanker Francois Louw at No 8 while leaving a specialist in the position, Duane Vermeulen, in France. South Africa have won one away match in 11 since the last World Cup as a team short on experience in a number of positions keeps getting exposed.

Wales suffered their annual defeat to Australia, and are left to reflect on a familiar tale of missed opportunities despite operating with two playmakers at 10 and 12. Wales have in recent years turned squandering overlaps into an art form, but on 16 minutes they put the ball through hands to give Steff Evans room to score in the left-hand corner, struggling to repeat it even when they had a man advantage. The intent was there, and considering they were well below strength with five of their summer Lions injured, the Wallabies were pushed harder in Cardiff than they were 12 months ago, when they faced a more settled side. In the last nine years Wales have played Australia, South Africa and New Zealand a total of 36 times and won a mere three. A main difference has been creativity, with the three southern hemisphere sides being able to win tight matches by scoring tries in the final quarter. Given their tendency to start a series slowly, it was, though, one of Wales’s better openers.

For the third time this year New Zealand virtually had a match won by half-time and then eased up. They were 40-6 ahead in Sydney at the interval and lost the second-half 28-6 and were 29-3 to the good in Buenos Aires before sharing 14 points with Argentina. They led France 31-5 in Paris on Saturday night, only for Les Bleus to rally when Sonny Bill Williams, whose red card against the Lions for a dangerous tackle turned the second Test in Wellington in July, forgot he was playing union rather than league and slapped a cross-kick over the dead-ball line after 47 minutes to prevent a try being scored. He was sent to the sin-bin and conceded a penalty try as France scored 13 unanswered points to threaten an unlikely comeback. The All Blacks eventually held on, and even added a fifth try in the final minute. But they are no longer armed with the feel of invincibility.

Gregor Townsend wants Scotand to become the fastest team in international rugby and they certainly made a rapid start against Samoa, scoring the first of their six tries against Samoa after two minutes through their full-back, Stuart Hogg. But their willingness to run from deep held as much risk as reward. The Pacific islanders – 10-32 down at one stage – rallied well and as a result left the home crowd nervously waiting for the final whistle. It was Townsend’s first home match in charge: his second will be against the masters of turning errors into tries, New Zealand, this weekend. That fixture promises to be another leg of the wacky races, with two teams committed to attack. For their part, Samoa, after two testing years since the 2015 World Cup, achieved a measure of redemption against Scotland on a weekend when the leading side in the south Pacific, Fiji, faltered in Italy. That defeat has to go down as a surprise given that Fiji were playing a team who were five places below them in the world rankings.

It was July 1990, and a week which started with an earthquake in the Philippines that killed 1,621 people and ended with Roger Waters performing The Wall in front of almost 500,000 people in Berlin. The businessman Donald Trump was only a few minutes away from going bankrupt.
The weather was sunny in Sweden between 15 and 21 July, pleasing all those in the middle of their holidays. The photographer Peter Widing, however, was not on holiday. He was working.
The 22-year-old was covering a youth football tournament, the Gothia Cup, for the Expressen newspaper. By one of the pitches he stopped and raised his camera. Maybe he already felt he had captured something special, but it was not until he developed the film that he saw the result.
The first time I saw what Widing had captured was 16 years later. I was doing work experience at the Offside football magazine and on the walls there were nine blown-up, framed photographs. All of them were taken by Widing. One was from a full Maracanã, another of Peter Schmeichel picking the ball out of the net during Euro 92. But the one I couldn’t take my eyes off was the picture Peter took that July day in 1990. Two blond, almost twin-like boys celebrating a goal or win. The shirts are neatly tucked into their shorts. In front of them, a chubby, sad opponent whose dreams had just been crushed.
The picture would not have had the same devastating effect had it been taken a second earlier or later. It is a moment that requires the blond boys’ synchronised celebrations, which, in turn, would not have meant anything if it was not for the contrasting boy in tears and tight shirt. It is a work of art that I have loved for the past 11 years.
When I had worked at Offside for a while and was given my own room I took the picture with me and hung it on the wall above my desk. I have looked at the boys so many times and wondered how their lives turned out. Sometimes I said to Peter that we should track them down. But he mainly shrugged and said it would never work. He was a man of few words and coming from him it meant something more like: “I will happily help if we really decide that we are going to do it.”
We never did. On 29 May 2016 Peter killed himself. His death was unimaginable and affected me more than anything else I have experienced. He was not only a colleague for 10 years but also a special friend. It is said that time heals every wound and perhaps the sorrow has diminished but I do not want to forget him and the picture has an important part to play. It still hangs above my desk and every time I look at the three boys I think of Peter.
Last winter I decided to find the main characters. There were a few clues in the picture. The boys looked like they were between 11 and 13 years old, which meant they should have been between 38 and 40 when I started looking. And because the picture is taken just as the boy to the right lifts his arms a club badge is revealed: Bele IK
Google says Bele is a club from Järfälla, outside Stockholm. In 2001 they merged with Barkaby SK to become Bele Barkaby IF. I email a club director and as I wait for a reply I contact the club which has organised the Gothia Cup since 1975, BK Häcken. They have no documentation from the 1990 tournament. “Sadly nothing.”
I visit a library in Gothenburg which has a microfiche of newspapers going back to the second world war. I look at Expressen between 15-21 July in 1990 – but there is no picture from Heden, where the tournament took place. Another local, newspaper, Göteborgs Posten, wrote more about the tournament but there is not a single mention of Bele IK. Disappointed, I leave the library and realise that even if someone working at Bele Barkaby can help me, they will find it difficult to remember a game from a tournament 27 years ago.
The only thing I know is that 937 teams from 42 different countries took part. One player, from a team called Voluntas, was called Andrea Pirlo. He was 11 that summer.
I cannot rule out that one of the three boys may have died, or is now a convicted murderer, or could have played 200 games in the Swedish top flight, that I might even have interviewed one of them.
Suddenly I got a text from Håkan, who works with Bele Barkaby: “I’ve got the names now. Will email you tomorrow, the boys love the photo!”
I ask excitedly if the boys had any details. “One of the lads thought they played a team from Malta.”
I phone Markus Gellner, the blond boy on the right of the picture, the next day. “Nah,” he says. “I think we were playing a team from Germany. I think we won big and maybe that’s why the boy is crying.”
He tells me he was born in 1978, which means that it was an under-12 game that was being played in July 1990. His team-mate in the picture is Mattias Dixner and they were best friends from Year 1 to the end of primary school; they played together almost every day. “I also remember playing a team from Germany,” Mattias says on the phone. “But also a team from Malta.”
I meet Mattias in a restaurant in Stockholm later, and he says: “I played football because all my friends did it. We had fun together and I didn’t want to be left out of that. Markus, on the other hand, lived for football. We lived about 500 metres from each other and there was a football pitch between us. So we just used to hang out there.”
Markus and Mattias drifted apart. Today Mattias is married and has two children. His interest in football is minimal. He played a season for Lökringen Oilers at a very low level but if he has some spare time he would rather watch Formula One.
When I meet Markus I ask whether he remembers anything specific, something that can lead me to the third boy.
He puts some snus underneath his upper lip and says: “I really think it was a team from Malta … but I don’t know why. We reached the B play-off but I think that picture is from the group stage. I remember we beat a German team 13-0 because we were going around singing “drei-zehn – null!” Beating a German team was big.”
Markus later joined the top-flight club AIK and was making good progress when, at break time at school, he was playing football and something in the back of his thigh went. The X-ray showed that a bit of bone had avulsed from his pelvis. He was told it was “impossible” to operate and that all he could do was wait. Six months soon became a year. No football. “The rehab took three years,” Markus says. “Slowly I lost contact with football without really noticing. Maybe it was lucky that it happened then, at a time in life when so much else is happening. New friends, girls, parties …”
Markus spent more and more time in the gym and finished second in a Swedish event called “athletic fitness” in 2005. “But then I reached a point where I started to question myself: ‘What am I doing?’ I had been obsessed with training for several years. One summer’s day I finished a training session and was walking to my apartment. People had their barbecues out and were drinking beers. There I was in heavy clothing so I would sweat as much as possible. It was a wake-up call. I had met my future wife Matilda and realised there was more to life than training so I stopped. I still train but it is at a reasonable level now. I like to drink a few beers, if we can put it that way.”
Markus wishes me good luck in finding the third person but there seems to be no information on who Bele IK were playing that day.
The weeks pass and I start to think I have reached the end of the road. But that’s not how it can end. Peter was the most stubborn person I ever met. He would not have given up.
I send a desperate email to BK Häcken, the organisers of the Gothia Cup, and include as many people as possible whose email addresses I can find on the club website. I tell them about Markus and Mattias and that it could be a team from either Malta or Germany. “Is there someone who is connected to the Gothia Cup with an extremely good memory?” I ask.
A few hours later I got a reply from Dennis Andersson, the club chairman. “During this period we had a lot of teams from Malta. The teams had different names but almost all the time they had the same sporting leader, Edgar Tonna. If the boy is from Malta then there is a good chance that Edgar can find him.”
I email Edgar but there is no reply. I look him up online and it seems as if he is alive and coaching youth teams in Malta. But no phone numbers, no Facebook. Then, after a week, he replies: “I have read your email and the player in the picture is Kevin Fenech. He played for Naxxar Lions and was dubbed ‘the Maltese Paul Gascoigne’ in one Swedish newspaper because of his dribbling skills. I’ll be in touch again.”
He later phones and gives me a number for Kevin. I dial the number the day after. Three times it rings before I hear a voice.
“Hello?”
“Hi, is this Kevin Fenech?”
“Yes.”
Two days later I am on a plane to Malta.
I first meet Edgar, Kevin’s coach in 1990. He told me Kevin was Naxxar’s best player and scored “four or five goals” in the tournament. Edgar says that it was such a huge experience for the boys to travel to Gothenburg. For many of them it was the first time they had been outside Malta. He tells me that one of the boys met a girl from China. The two of them became pen pals and 10 years later the Chinese girl moved to Malta. They are still together as far as Edgar knows.
There are sad stories as well. Edgar tells me their goalkeeper at the Gothia Cup, Simon, discovered a month after the tournament that he had leukemia and died soon afterwards. “The whole team was at the funeral,” says Edgar. “It was unbearably sad. Most of that team was in the same class and knew each other extremely well. Before he died he said he wanted to get buried in his goalkeeping jersey. So there he was in the coffin with the same shirt he had worn at the Gothia Cup. It was terrible.”
In Valletta the sky is blue and it is 21C as I wait for Kevin. At long last I am going to meet the boy with the tear-filled cheeks who has escaped me for so many years. We hug each other when he arrives. He is short, newly shaved and in good spirits. He is nothing like the chubby boy I have looked at so many times down the years. The 39-year-old Kevin Fenech is in good shape.
I show him the picture. “Wow, I wasn’t just a little chubby. I was fat! I guess I was [fat] for a few years. You know, I loved sweets and ice cream.”
Kevin stopped playing football two years after the tournament in Sweden and it was not until he was 17 that he picked it up again. He realised how much he missed it: the togetherness and the friends. When he was appointed as an administrator in the army he started playing for their team and then rejoined Naxxar Lions, whose first team were soaring through the divisions.
“I’ve kept that newspaper article about me and Gascoigne. It is funny because Gazza really was my idol. I was a bit round like him and I said to my mum to cut my hair like him.”
He looks out over the sea and continues: “Yes, I cried a lot. My mood was terrible and I cried after every game we lost. But this time it was because we had just conceded. Because we actually won against Bele, 3-1. We won our group and didn’t lose a game before we went out against that other Swedish team … Ytterby? You should have seen me then. I think I cried for two hours after that game. An old Swedish man felt so sorry for me that he bought me a large ice cream.”
Before we finish, he says: “It was a really talented photographer in any case. He really captured me.”
As the sun sets on my last evening on the Mediterranean I sit in an Italian restaurant and think about Kevin, Markus and Mattias. Life has worked out well for them. They are parents and all seem to be good dads.
Kevin said he was a bit fed up with his work in the army but then corrected himself. “A lot of the army’s time is spent on all the people who flee from north Africa. They come in a dinghy in worn-out clothes without a single possession. When I complain my wife says to me ‘It’s not you we should feel sorry for, Kevin.’
How Kevin’s, Markus’s and Mattias’s lives will turn out nobody knows. Peter is proof of that. So I think about how Peter would have loved the sun in Malta, that he would have liked the restaurant. Italian food was his favourite. I order a bottle of Amarone, the wine Peter preferred and raise my glass to my lips, pausing before I take a first sip. Quietly I say: “It worked out, Widdy. We did it, buddy.”
This is a translated and edited extract from a piece which initially appeared in the Swedish football magazine Offside in June 2017.


Will the last Olympic sport in Britain free from bullying, sexism or racism allegations – or, indeed, disgruntled athletes – please turn out the lights? The question is especially pertinent given British Gymnastics has now joined the lengthy roll call of sporting bodies accused of allowing “a culture of fear”, with athletes and coaches afraid to speak out for fear of reprisals.
How many times must we hear that F-word before we accept that it is not just the odd snowflake who cannot handle the rough and tumble of elite sport? And, then, will we actually pledge to do something about it? With each fresh revelation we see two things with greater clarity: that the system for representing and protecting athletes is not fit for purpose; and, now more than ever, a powerful and independent union for Olympic athletes is urgently needed.
As the Guardian reports, the country’s top gymnasts, including the double Olympic champion Max Whitlock, have been warned they could lose their lottery funding if they do not sign their Athlete Performance Awards – essentially a grant from UK Sport – because of what they see as an exploitative contract. Imagine if there was an independent union fighting their corner. At a stroke it would rebalance the power dynamic between those with the money and those who win medals.
A union could also address the little stuff too, including all the minor injustices many athletes face that do not make back-page news, and the startling lack of transparency in the system.
I heard a story this weekend, for instance, of someone who was promised more funding if he reached a certain target – only for the offer to vanish when he did. Dumbstruck, he asked his performance director whether he should appeal. The answer was blunt: “No, you will lose your money.” How could the director be so sure? Because he would be the judge of the case.
Another athlete told how he lost his funding two months after he was seriously injured while training. The loss of cash was painful enough without his rehab bills no longer being paid. A third felt others in his sport were treated better because they had coaches funded by the system. He could not be sure because of the lack of transparency over funding decisions.
One might think these were the grumblings of people who found the going too tough. But one of the athletes is an Olympic medallist. Another made the podium at a world championship. The third reached an Olympic final. They appreciate the benefits of the system that helped get them there but they are not blind to its flaws. As one put it: “I am not an idiot. I know elite sport is cut-throat by its very nature. But there are better ways to do things.”
No one denies that the elite funding has been a huge success, which dragged British sport out of the mid-1990s doldrums. Or that those involved, from UK Sport downwards, have much to be proud of. But the lack of acknowledgment from senior figures about the extent of the current problems in the system is puzzling. Clearly the British Athletes Commission, the body largely responsible for helping athletes, is not doing enough, otherwise it would be unearthing these scandals.
If it was, brave whistleblowers would not keep going to journalists.
Another interesting facet to this is the debate – fuelled by the case of the cyclist Jess Varnish, who is suing UK Sport and British Cycling for gender discrimination, detriment for whistleblowing, victimisation and unfair dismissal – over whether athletes should be considered “employees” or remain as “members of staff”, which allows UK Sport to avoid paying pension and national insurance contributions on their grants.
Those inside the system insist that, if athletes are seen as employees, then UK Sport would not be able to fund as many future stars, and the country might lose medals as a result. That may be true but a more pressing issue is how to empower athletes so they feel valued, have more say in their sport and a better life when they are done, because losing lottery funding is often brutal. As one person put it to me: “I was cut with two weeks’ notice and suddenly I had to adjust to normal life, with no education and £20,000 in credit card debts.”
A union could at least soften the landing, perhaps by arranging for a month’s extra funding for every year an athlete had competed in a GB vest or been on funding. The help might be smaller than that. Even some medical support or access to facilities might help young athletes taken off funding find their mojo again. Making part-time work or study a condition of funding would be no bad thing either, given it could be scribbled on to the CV, post-retirement.
None of these suggestions is outlandish. Indeed, only last month German athletes confirmed they were on the verge of setting up a new and independent organisation that would be entirely separate from the German Olympic Sports Confederation.
As Max Hartung, a fencer and current chair of the athletes’ committee of the DOSB, explained: “We want to have our say on equal terms. Up to now that has not been the case.”
How long before British athletes decide the time has come to follow suit?


So much time has passed since the New Orleans Saints became the best story in the NFL it’s hard to remember their miraculous rise. That came back in the fall of 2006 just a year after Hurricane Katrina tore the roof off their Superdome and filled the city with so much water that many wondered if New Orleans would be the same again. But as the politicians failed and the government failed and the utilities failed, the football team that once broke their fans’ hearts actually came through.
The dreadful Saints, the forever losing Saints, the always-aggravating Saints returned from purgatory in San Antonio. They rode the genius of a brilliant young coach, Sean Payton, and a rejuvenated quarterback, Drew Brees, all the way to the 2006 NFC Championship Game and then they kept building to a Super Bowl win three seasons later. With a fabulous offense and a gambling defense they seemed poised to win more trophies.
Then they didn’t. The defense failed, and then came Bountygate and Payton’s year-long suspension and a whole lot of 7-9 seasons during which Brees threw for a lot of yards and the Saints defense couldn’t stop anybody. As the old stars left and Brees grew to be 38 it appeared New Orleans was finished as any kind of contender.
Except, suddenly this year happened and the Saints have discovered something in Brees’s sunset they never had in his prime: a defense. And more than halfway through this season their 7-2 record raises a once-improbable question: Are the New Orleans Saints the best team in the NFL?
They might just be. Even 2009’s Super Bowl winner relied heavily on Brees’s arm and a defense that gave up tons of yards while laying out big hits and hoping that they could get enough turnovers to supplement the booming offense. This team, though, actually stops opponents. They may not have the huge statistical dominance of other good defensive teams but after starting 0-2 they have won seven straight and in five of those wins they have allowed 13 points or fewer. They are becoming very good at keeping teams from doing what they want.
Sunday’s 47-10 victory at Buffalo may have been the Saints most impressive victory yet. Their defense held the Bills to just 198 yards and drove quarterback Tyrod Taylor from the game after he completed only nine passes for 56 yards.
That alone makes this unit unlike Payton’s teams of the past. As Brees has aged, New Orleans have pounded teams with a relentless running attack. And that looks nothing like the team that used to throw and throw and throw as the points rolled up. On Sunday, both Mark Ingram and Alvin Kamara ran for more than 100 yards and together they had four touchdowns. Brees only had 184 yards passing.
“We came out and we wanted to impose our will,” Kamara told reporters after the game.
Make no mistake, this is still Brees’s team. He is playing one of his most efficient seasons and remains near the top of the list of the NFL’s top passers this season. He has grown into more of a game-manager but the best quarterbacks adapt. As do the best coaches. And while this might not be a stereotypical Sean Payton team tearing up the NFC South, he may be doing one of his best coaching jobs yet.
And the Saints may be about to become the NFL’s best story once more.
“It felt good, it felt real good” – San Francisco 49ers coach Kyle Shanahan
The Niners finally won their first game this season and the young head coach who many believe will become a top offensive mind like his father also got his first NFL victory. The wait must have felt endless. San Francisco came into Sunday’s game against the New York Giants 0-9 with what is supposed to be a rebuilding team. But as woeful as the 49ers have been this season they may have found a team even worse. The Giants look lost.
San Francisco quarterback CJ Beathard threw for 298 yards and Carlos Hyde ran for 98 as the Niners trampled the Giants’ defense for 474 yards. As a result, New York dropped to 1-8 despite a good game from quarterback Eli Manning who fought off rumors he may lose his job with two touchdown passes and no interceptions.
The Niners’ pleasure in victory was dampened by the death of wide receiver Marquise Goodwin’s son earlier on Sunday. A visibly emotional Goodwin was surrounded by team-mates after scoring an 83-yard touchdown in the first quarter.
Matthew Stafford. The Lions quarterback doesn’t always get the credit he deserves mainly because the Lions always seem to be stumbling over themselves. Still, Stafford, who already is in his ninth season, is quietly one of the league’s better passers. On Sunday, the Lions struggled to beat the hapless Cleveland Browns but Stafford was brilliant when he needed to be.
He threw for 249 yards in Detroit’s 38-24 victory and also had three touchdowns against one interception. He finished with a passer rating of 118.9. This may be Stafford’s best season as he has already thrown for just under 2,500 yards and 17 touchdowns with just five interceptions. He has to be considered part of the conversation for the top NFC offensive player even if it is hard to see the Lions, at 5-4, passing Minnesota for the NFC North title.
12. The number of receptions Jacksonville tight end Marcedes Lewis has this season – all of which have come in Jaguars wins. It is a strange statistical pattern to say the least but, by now, the Jags must be elated when a ball lands in Lewis’s hands. He has caught passes in five of Jacksonville’s six victories this year, failing to grab one only in their season-opening win over Houston. On Sunday, he caught two balls, including a key first-down pass in the second half, helping the Jags beat the Chargers 20-17 in overtime.
Lewis, who was once a big star for Jacksonville, is less of a key player now. In fact, he might be more a talisman than an offensive threat but he’s played a role in the Jags’ sudden rise toward the playoffs. Sunday’s win was probably the most-unlikely for Jacksonville, who seemed certain to lose until a field goal just before the end of regulation tied the game at 17-17. Another field goal won the game for the Jaguars, who remained tied for first in the AFC South with Tennessee.

What a wonderful opportunity the NFL wasted for years by banning players from celebrating touchdowns. So much creativity squandered. Week-after-week NFL receivers provide us with splendid displays in stadium end zones. Take Sunday in Landover, Maryland, for instance.
As the Minnesota Vikings leapfrogged over Washington in the second quarter of their 38-30 victory Adam Theilen and his fellow Minnesota receivers decided to leapfrog each other. It tuned out to be the ultimate leapfrog as the Vikings kept scoring and scoring and then held on for the win. While it appears Minnesota are headed to a certain NFC North title, they do not seem certain about a quarterback. Case Keenum has filled in brilliantly for the injured Sam Bradford. But he let Washington back in Sunday’s game with interceptions on back-to-back throws.
Teddy Bridgewater, who was once the Vikings quarterback of the future before his gruesome injury before last season, is healthy. Could Bridgewater be the one to lead them through January?
--The New England Patriots aren’t quite the unbeaten team that some predicted they would be this season but they have now won five in a row and were in ominous form coming off their bye week. The Denver Broncos were the victims on Sunday as the Pats travelled to Colorado and came away with a 41-16 win. Tom Brady threw for three touchdowns and was comfortable enough for Brian “The New Jimmy Garoppolo” Hoyer to come on and toss a few passes. Denver are now a worrying 3-6 and Brock Osweiler does not look like a starting quarterback.
--Pittsburgh continues to grind out victories, beating Indianapolis 20-17. The Steelers trailed 17-3 midway through the third quarter before scoring 17 straight points, including the winning field goal, which came as time expired. The victory gave the 7-2 Steelers a commanding lead in a weak AFC North.
--The Green Bay Packers won their first game without Aaron Rodgers as they beat Chicago 23-16. Rodgers replacement, Brett Hundley completed only 18 passes but threw one touchdown and was not intercepted as the Bears fell despite what was easily rookie quarterback Mitchell Trubisky’s best game.
--The Rams are now an amazing 7-2 and Jared Goff continues to look like an excellent choice as a first overall pick in 2016. He had 355 passing yards and three touchdowns in a 33-7 defeat of Houston.


Evan Williams, the Vale of Glamorgan trainer, achieved the astonishing feat of saddling horses to finish placed in five consecutive Grand Nationals between 2009 and 2013. The names of the two horses involved in that remarkable achievement are State Of Play and Cappa Bleu. Most people only dream of winning the Aintree spectacular, but Williams may just be getting that glint of hope in his eye of actually winning the big one with Cesar Collonges (1.00), who runs at Carlisle and is on offer at 11-4.
Owned by the Rucker family, whose blue colours were also sported by State Of Play and Cappa Bleu, Cesar Collonges cost £200,000 last year after he won an Irish point to point. He was foaled by a half-sister to the dam of Neptune Collonges, who won the 2012 Grand National for Paul Nicholls.
All of which does not mean the five year old will win at Carlisle over a distance sure to be short of what he will need in time, but he looks to have an excellent chance, especially having shown promise at this track in mid-October and with the Williams yard boasting a high ratio of winners in the last 10 days.
There was money on Sunday night for a Kevin Ryan-trained rival, Canny Style, who has won five times on the Flat. It will be fascinating to see who emerges best of these two in this novice hurdle clash between a fresh recruit from the level and an expensive jumping-bred purchase.
Gary Moore is a trainer who hit a high winning strike-rate a fortnight ago and perhaps he can resume that successful run with Bad Boy Du Pouldu (1.20), who looks primed to perform well at odds of 12-1 at Kempton.

Perhaps emboldened by rumours Neymar has told some of his former Barcelona team-mates that he regrets joining Paris Saint-Germain, Florentino Pérez has decided the Brazilian might like to go Real Madrid instead. At least that’s what the Spanish website Don Balon are telling their readers, even if the story seems decidedly fanciful and unlikely. PSG have no intention of selling their star signing any time soon, but that won’t stop the Real president testing the waters by offering Gareth Bale and Toni Kroos as part of a players-plus-cash deal worth up to €400m to bring the Brazilian to the Santiago Bernabéu. Neymar was busy last night, opening the scoring for Brazil from the penalty spot in a friendly win against Japan in Lille. The Guardian’s man on the spot was David Hytner, who liked what he saw of Brazil, but was rather less impressed with their star player’s demonstration of petulance.
Neymar isn’t the only big name on the Real Madrid radar, with Lyon’s Nabil Fekir also being touted as a more realistic target. With a string of impressive performances and 12 goals already this season, the 24-year-old has got antennae twitching all over Europe and Manchester United, Arsenal and Juventus are monitoring his progress. Capable of playing in the hole or as an out and out striker, Fekir has been heavily linked with a move to the Emirates and tabloid reports in the UK suggest the club might be close to securing his services for £60m, which would help soften the blow of losing Alexis Sánchez or Mesut Özil this January.
Luke Shaw’s Manchester United purgatory could be nearing its end, with The Times stating that the club are prepared to sell him in January for £20m, two thirds of what they paid to bring him from St Mary’s to Old Trafford three years ago. Unloved and unwanted by United manager José Mourinho, Shaw has been courted by Turkish club Fenerbahce but is keen to move somewhere closer to home. One Manchester United player Mourinho is considerably more keen to keep hold of is Ander Herrera and the Portuguese has ordered the United hierarchy to trigger a 12-month extension in the midfielder’s contract to prevent him leaving on a free transfer at the end of the season. Herrera can talk to foreign clubs in January and Atlético Madrid are understood to be making doe-eyes in his general direction. Meanwhile in Italy, Roma, Napoli and Juventus are all falling over themselves in the rush to sign out of favour United defender Matteo Darmian. Still in the market for a new full-back following the departure of Dani Alves to PSG, Juventus will try to prise Héctor Bellerin away from Arsenal.
Atlético Madrid striker Fernando Torres is pining for one last hurrah in the Premier League and could move to Southampton or Newcastle, while his former club Liverpool are hoping to sign teenage midfielder Morgan Gibbs-White from Championship table-toppers Wolves. The Merseyside club look likely to lose Emre Can, whose contract expires at the end of this season. The German is being courted by Juventus and Manchester City, who are both interested in snapping him up on a free next summer. And finally, Wilfried Zaha will have the summer off after Ivory Coast failed to qualify for the World Cup finals. With his club side Crystal Palace also struggling, the winger can perhaps take some consolation that Arsène Wenger wants to bring him to Arsenal.


A day after VAR made its inconspicuous British bow at Wembley Accrington Stanley felt it could have come in handy at Cambridge United. John Coleman, their manager, thought they should have had two penalties. “We’re not into video technology yet,” he said, before acknowledging, “but the referee’s got to make a split decision.”
Coleman’s frustration was understandable. Victory would have put them top of League Two, with Notts County drawing. But in the hard-fought event it was probably as well no split‑second decision at either end separated the sides from goalless equality. In any case a year ago, with Cambridge leading 2-1, Accrington were awarded two added-time penalties and scored neither.
Keeper and both takers have moved on and one of the more intriguing duels, which broke out after half-time here, was between Cambridge’s experienced new keeper, David Forde, of the Republic of Ireland, and the Northern Irish striker Billy Kee, who leads the division’s scorers. Both their minds might legitimately have been elsewhere.
Four games unbeaten had confirmed Cambridge’s mid-table position under Shaun Derry. Coleman knew what to expect. “They are big and strong and I wouldn’t be surprised if they are knocking about at the top end come the end of the season,” he said beforehand.
They were knocking about at the top end here, with their front two, Jabo Ibehre and Uche Ikpeazu, built like rugby locks, proving more of an armful than handful for Accrington’s defence. Ben Richards-Everton and Mark Hughes, with judicious concentration and commitment, held their own and sometimes a bit more to keep them at bay from the 6ft 8in Aaron Chapman in goal. A notice on the adjacent Coldham’s Common says: “Please be aware this site is grazed.” Coleman’s side were content to be bruised but unbeaten. Their target average is two points a game.
If the first half was early closing, the second was late-night shopping, end-to-end play replacing midfield overcrowding. “It was a bit too open for me,” Coleman said, but straight after the restart Jordan Clark could have put Accrington ahead from Sean McGonville’s free-kick, then Kee on the right touchline caught Forde away from his line with a curling shot that came out off the bar and McGonville could not convert. The new scene was set and Jevani Brown, Cambridge’s dynamo, flashed a shot wide at the other end.
When Ibehre failed to beat Chapman from four yards, the whistle for a foul in the six-yard area spared his blushes but, with a different outcome, it could have been another one for the video assistant referee. There was no argument over Forde’s save as Kayden Jackson crossed to Kee steaming and screaming to the near post. Forde was perfectly placed for a helpless block. Jackson has seven goals himself to Kee’s 10 and they share lightning speed and understanding.
Accrington are one of the wonders of the Football League. The town had a club in the original dozen of 1888. Stanley, in Stanley Street, were founded in 1891, entered the League in 1921 and enjoyed their only two years in the third tier in 1958-60 before bankruptcy in 1962 between the first-class retirement of those two immortal north-western Stanleys, Mortensen and Matthews. Reformed in 1968, they worked their way back to the League in 2006, guided by Coleman, who clocked up 587 games from 1999 to 2012 and returned in 2014 via Rochdale, Southport and Sligo Rovers to the club that is clearly in his blood. Saturday’s was his 760th match for them.
He took them to fifth in 2011 and fourth in 2016, yet still last season, when a late spurt took them into play-off running again, they had the League’s lowest average crowds at 1,699, four fewer than Morecambe. They took 173 to Cambridge for an afternoon that from Last Post to last kick showed all that is good and charming about the Football League which nonetheless, in keeping with the game’s expanding greed, is enabling the rich to get richer by playing Championship games on Sunday while Leagues One and Two are in danger of being forgotten.
• League Two produced two reminders on Saturday, as if they were needed, that added time is no time to let up or give up. Swindon, embarrassingly 2-1 down at home to the bottom club, Chesterfield, were awarded a penalty in the 94th minute and Luke Norris, the foulee, converted it in the 96th after a two-minute mill. The centre-half Will Boyle’s for Cheltenham against Luton was also in the 96th minute and was more in the nature of a pushover try to produce the same 2-2 result. Victory would have put Luton on top of the table.
• The same message came from Scunthorpe in League One as they beat Bristol Rovers with the only goal of the game. Both sides, as so often, felt they could have won it and there were plenty of chances at both ends. Neal Bishop found the answer in the 94th minute to enhance The Iron’s place in the play-offs and condemn Rovers to their fourth defeat in five league games. Bradford, a place above Scunthorpe beforehand and given the same opportunity to get among the top three, who were not playing because of international calls, were unable to take advantage at home to Plymouth, whose 1-0 win lifted them off the foot of the table and landed Bury, who drew at Gillingham, in their place.


All the talk in the buildup to the start of England’s autumn internationals was how they would perform without Owen Farrell and Maro Itoje. But the biggest miss for Eddie Jones was Billy Vunipola.
Eddie was spot on when he said England just didn’t click, but while I thought a lack of cohesion would be understandable there was a fair bit more of it than I expected. And Vunipola’s absence is massive in that respect. Billy is such a huge focal point for England in terms of go-forward. He gives you 15-20 carries a game, it’s always over the gain line, and when you don’t have someone doing that it means you don’t have enough front-foot ball.
At times England looked good; when George Ford was able to get on the front foot he could bring players into the game, but it just didn’t happen enough. When Billy is there, it does. He’s their go-to man, he’s their talisman, and I’m not saying Nathan Hughes had a bad game – because he was actually one of the best players – but he just doesn’t have the impact that Billy has.
That then becomes a problem for the midfield because they can’t get into the game as much as they’d like, and I think we saw that with Henry Slade trying just a bit too hard. He was overeager to impact the game. Because England weren’t getting much of that front-foot ball, he wasn’t able to get the space he wanted. As a consequence, the centres weren’t much of a factor until the end of the game when it opened up a little bit more – Alex Lozowski came on, got that front-foot ball immediately and all of a sudden they were off. Danny Care was a big part of that, too, as the ball quickened up a bit more.
But I would have loved to have seen Slade at 13. I can’t remember the last time I saw him play at 12 – he seems to have always been 10 or 13 – and it’s important to bear in mind that it’s a very different position. People think, “oh, he’s right next to the outside-centre, it shouldn’t be too different”, but it really is. This is a fly-half talking here, but it’s like telling a loosehead to play tighthead because it should be pretty much the same. It doesn’t work like that.
With Slade at 13 and being that little bit wider, it gives him that bit more room. On Saturday he was right next to Ford and it didn’t seem to work – the two playmakers cancelled each other out. But having him in the wider channels, influencing things out there, would be great to see. The fact that there is no big ball carrier in the backs only emphasised how much they missed Billy. In terms of the 10-12-13, they’re all much of a muchness really. I know Jonathan Joseph isn’t a 10, but neither he, Ford nor Slade are going to bash down the house. Farrell will, because although he’s a playmaker he’s abrasive, he’s a bit different in that regard.
Additionally, if you have someone like Manu Tuilagi or Ben Te’o out there it makes a big difference, because defences have to watch them more. I’m a big fan of that approach, of having another ball player in the midfield, but having the big battering ram in the centres as well. That’s how Samu Kerevi did it for Australia against Wales or Robbie Henshaw for Ireland against South Africa, running these hard lines and opening up extra fractions of seconds for other players – like a Slade, or an Anthony Watson – to come into the line.
On the plus side for England, defensively they were comfortable, and while Paul Gustard will no doubt be frustrated with Argentina’s late try and a few too many penalties, he’ll be pleased with Sam Underhill. I’ve always been vocal about specialist openside flankers and how important they can be because, coming from the southern hemisphere, they’re a dime a dozen down there. It made a pleasant change to see a guy go out there for England, smashing into tackles and having the ability to be in the right place at the right time. If there was an area where he could improve it is being more involved in the attacking side of the game, watching Michael Hooper from Australia and New Zealand’s Sam Cane, the way they connect in the attacking structure – linking play by carrying in wide channels – we don’t see that from Underhill as much.
On the whole, I don’t think there’s cause for concern with Australia next up on Saturday. England will be a bit wary because the Wallabies are playing very well, but England will be much sharper because, after all, this was their first match for a long time.
Against Wales, Australia’s set-piece went reasonably well. But in attack they were excellent. Kurtley Beale had a really good game, so did Bernard Foley. Will Genia controlled things very nicely, and we saw what a good pair of half-backs can do with Conor Murray and Johnny Sexton for Ireland against South Africa. That will be where England will need to shut them down.
I don’t think Eddie will make too many changes because he will want to give those newer players another go. Of course he will want to win, but this is the time to test these players out. If he wants to see how people react under pressure, then playing against Australia is perfect.


Tim Cahill says he is fit and raring to go for Australia’s must-win World Cup qualifying play-off clash with Honduras in Sydney on Wednesday. The striker was an unused substitute in the first leg in San Pedro Sula, as he nursed an ankle injury, but he is looking forward to playing his role when a spot at the 2018 World Cup in Russia is decided at ANZ Stadium.
Asked about his fitness, Cahill said he was ready to start if that’s what coach Ange Postecoglou wants. “If I had to play in Honduras I definitely would have made a contribution,” Cahill said. “That’s what it’s all about, putting your body on the line and sacrificing for these two games, for such a big occasion for our country to qualify for a fourth consecutive World Cup.”
The equation is simple for Australia after a 0-0 result in the first leg; win and they are in. Another deadlock would see extra-time and a dreaded penalty shootout – any other result would send the Central Americans to Russia.
But a bullish Cahill said he couldn’t see it going past 90 minutes on Wednesday night. “Everything is going really well,” he said. “We’re not going to be blasé in anyway. We always respect our opponent but from the performance we’ve seen in Honduras, I feel the team is ready to put a good performance out.”
The Socceroos’ all-time leading scorer, 37-year-old Cahill said he wasn’t thinking about an alternative result to winning – and whether that would spell the end of his international career.
Meanwhile, Honduras touched down in Sydney on Monday morning and did not appear unduly weary, despite having travelled via commercial flights, more than 18 hours after the Socceroos’ specially-equipped charter flight arrived.
The players emerged in team gear and stopped and posed for photographs with around 25 of their cheering fans gathered at Sydney airport. Coach Jorge Luis Pinto was also a popular target of the snap-happy fans, who brought colour and noise to the busy airport.
The Hondurans are unlikely to have much support at ANZ Stadium night, despite the fact they remain in with a chance after a 0-0 draw in their home leg last weekend. “It’s not a huge community,” one supporter called Carlos said of the number of Hondurans living in Sydney.
However, based on the Sydney 2000 Olympics he did expect some fans to travel. “’A few usually do [travel]. For the 2000 Sydney Olympics I was surprised that there was a good size of visitors,” said Carlos, who was present when Honduras beat Australia 2-1 in that tournament.
Australia are favoured to progress to Russia, but Carlos expected Honduras to be competitive and wouldn’t be too upset if the Socceroos advanced. “I hope Honduras will win, and I’m pretty sure they are going to have a good game,” he said. “For the time I’ve been here, 30 years, I’m a good supporter of Honduras, but also I support Australia, half and half. So I hope the best team will win, either one I’d be happy.”.


West Ham manager David Moyes has filled out his backroom staff by appointing Alan Irvine and Stuart Pearce as assistants, with Sunderland coach Billy McKinlay set to follow in the coming days.
Moyes was confirmed as the Hammers manager last week after Slaven Bilic was sacked, despite significant adverse reaction from the club’s supporters. Now he has brought in two men he has worked with before, while Pearce returns to the club he made 50 appearances for between 1999 and 2001.
Irvine was Moyes’ assistant at Everton and Preston North End, but broke away to pursue his own managerial career, the most recent appointment being at Norwich where he was caretaker at the end of last season. McKinlay, who was on Moyes’ coaching staff at Real Sociedad and Sunderland, had been in caretaker charge of the Black Cats along with Robbie Stockdale after the dismissal of Simon Grayson. While West Ham said in a statement on their website they “hope to confirm the appointment” of the Scot in the coming days, Sunderland said on their official website that he has left them to link up with Moyes.
“I’m really looking forward to coming in and getting involved,” Pearce, former England under-21s manager but who hasn’t worked in the game since being sacked by Nottingham Forest in 2015, told West Ham’s website.
“The opportunity to work with David Moyes, who I have respected greatly over the years, was a big factor, as was having previously played for the club.
“It’s been many years since I was there for a couple of seasons, but I really enjoyed my time. The West Ham fans were fantastic to me and I’m looking forward to coming back.
“It’s tough times at the moment but it’s a fantastic opportunity for me. I’m really excited by the challenge.”
The Hammers are third bottom in the Premier League, which led to Moyes replacing Bilic a week ago.
“I’m delighted to be given this opportunity and am really looking forward to the challenge ahead,” Irvine said.
“I obviously know David well from our time together at Preston and Everton, and it was certainly a big attraction to work with him again, as was the thought of coming to a club like West Ham.
“This is the sixth job I have been offered since leaving Norwich at the end of last season - some of which were very attractive - but it’s the first one that has persuaded me to accept, so I hope that says a lot about how excited I am to be here.”


Three players took a knee during the national anthem before the New York Giants game at the San Francisco 49ers, as the rest of the league stood during Veterans Day weekend.
49ers Eric Reid and Marquise Goodwin, both of whom have been protesting for most of the season, knelt, as did Giants defensive end Olivier Vernon, who was just activated. Vernon had been protesting while he was injured. Goodwin and his wife had lost their baby son earlier on Sunday due to complications during pregnancy.
David Lombardi of The Athletic later tweeted a photo of Reid embracing an Air Force member. Reid has said his protest is not against the military.
“This is not about the military, this is not about the flag, this is not about the anthem. My mother served in the armed forces. Three of my uncles served in the armed forces,” said Reid in October. “I have the utmost respect for the military, for the anthem, for the flag ... This is about systemic oppression that has been rampant in this country for decades on top of decades.”
The NFL Players Association had asked all players to observe a two-minute moment of silence before games to honor veterans. Other players who have been protesting most of the season stood for the anthem this week, including the Seahawks Michael Bennett, who stood before Thursday night’s game. Bennett’s father is a Navy veteran. Titans receiver Rishard Matthews walked onto the field holding hands with soldiers and stood with team-mates for the anthem for the first time since President Donald Trump criticized players for protesting.

The vast majority of NFL players are now standing for the anthem.
Former 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick began the protest movement last season. He remains unsigned and has filed a complaint that team owners colluded against him because of the protests aimed at police brutality against Africa Americans and other issues.


Case Keenum threw touchdowns to four different receivers to build a big lead, and the NFC North-leading Minnesota Vikings won their fifth in a row against Washington 38-30 despite two second-half interceptions.
With Teddy Bridgewater active for the first time since January 2016 after a devastating knee injury, Keenum was 21 of 29 for 304 yards and TD passes to Stefon Diggs, Adam Thielen, David Morgan and Jarius Wright. He was picked off on consecutive throws by DJ Swearinger. Thielen had eight catches for a season-high 166 yards.
A day after being called up from the practice squad, second-year Washington receiver Maurice Harris came up with a highlight-reel grab: a diving, one-handed catch for a touchdown on the opening drive. The 36-yard play originally was ruled an incompletion, but Washington challenged and the call was reversed on replay review.
The New England Patriots aren’t quite the unbeaten team that some predicted they would be this season but they have now won five in a row and were in ominous form coming off their bye week. The Denver Broncos were the victims on Sunday as the Pats travelled to Colorado and came away with a 41-16 win. Tom Brady threw for three touchdowns and was comfortable enough for Brian Hoyer to come on and toss a few passes. Denver are now a worrying 3-6 and Brock Osweiler does not look like a starting quarterback.
Adrian Clayborn set an Atlanta record with six sacks, Matt Ryan threw a pair of short touchdown passes and the Falcons romped to a 27-7 victory over the Dallas Cowboys, who looked anemic offensively in their first game without suspended running back Ezekiel Elliott.
Ryan hooked up with Justin Hardy on a three-yard pass for Atlanta’s first offensive touchdown in the third quarter this season. Early in the fourth, Ryan put the game away for the Falcons (5-4) by tossing one to Austin Hooper for a one-yard score.
Robert Woods caught two of Jared Goff’s three touchdown passes during a dominant third quarter, and the surging Los Angeles Rams returned after a month away from home for their fourth straight victory, 33-7 over the depleted Houston Texans.
After struggling to a 9-7 lead during a quiet first half for the NFL’s highest-scoring team, the Rams (7-2) ran away with a series of big throws by Goff, who passed for a career-high 355 yards.
CJ Beathard threw for 288 yards and two touchdowns and ran for a third score to lead the San Francisco 49ers to their first win of the season with a 31-21 victory over the New York Giants.
Beathard connected on an 83-yard TD to Marquise Goodwin and a 47-yarder to Garrett Celek in the second quarter as the 49ers (1-9) took advantage of another listless effort by the Giants (1-8) to win for the first time under coach Kyle Shanahan.
Ben Roethlisberger’s 32-yard completion to Antonio Brown with 35 seconds set up a 33-yard field goal from Chris Boswell as time expired Sunday, giving Pittsburgh a 20-17 come-from-behind win at Indianapolis.
The Steelers (7-2) have won four straight overall and five in a row in the series. But it sure wasn’t easy as the Colts (3-7) held Roethlisberger, Antonio Brown and Le’Veon Bell in check. Pittsburgh needed two second-half TD passes from Roethlisberger to fight its way out of a 17-3 third-quarter deficit. And Roethlisberger reverted to his traditional form on the Steelers’ final possession.
“Big Ben is Big Ben and he finds guys, and we’ve got him in second-and-long and he finds a guy, and then he scrambles around and finds Antonio Brown,” Colts coach Chuck Pagano said. “That’s what he does.”
The two-time Super Bowl champion methodically marched the Steelers 70 yards in the final 3 minutes, 10 seconds to give Pittsburgh its only lead. Roethlisberger was 19 of 31 for 236 yards with one interception. Bell had 26 carries for 80 yards and Brown, the league’s leading receiver, caught three passes for 47 yards.
Mark Ingram scored a career-best three touchdowns and the New Orleans Saints won their seventh straight game by plowing through a porous Buffalo Bills defense in a 47-10 rout.
Alvin Kamara also had a three-yard touchdown rushing as the Saints blew the game open by scoring five times on their first six possessions, not including a one-play series to close the first half. Ingram finished with 131 yards rushing by scoring twice from three yards, and another on a one-yard plunge. The Saints finished with 298 yards rushing and 32 first downs.
Brett Hundley threw for 212 yards and a touchdown, Nick Perry had three sacks and the Green Packers beat the Chicago Bears 23-16 to snap a three-game losing streak.
Hundley, starting his third game for an injured Aaron Rodgers, threw a 17-yard touchdown to Davante Adams to make it 23-13 with 5:29 to play, and the Packers (5-4) hung on to beat the Bears (3-6) for the eighth time in nine games. Chicago’s Mitchell Trubisky threw for a career-high 297 yards. He hit Josh Bellamy for a 46-yard touchdown in the fourth quarter, but the Bears dropped their second in a row after winning back-to-back games.
The win was Green Bay’s first since a narrow victory at Dallas on 8 October. A week later, Rodgers got driven to the turf by the Vikings’ Anthony Barr in a loss at Minnesota week and the Packers haven’t been the same since then.
Matthew Stafford lofted a 29-yard, tiebreaking touchdown to Eric Ebron early in the fourth quarter and the Detroit Lions went on to beat the winless Cleveland Browns. The Lions (5-4) rallied from first- and second-half deficits to earn consecutive victories for the first time since winning the first two games this season.
The Browns, who fell to 0-9 on the season, led 10-0 early in the game for their first double-digit lead of the season, and were up 24-17 in the third after Deshone Kizer led two consecutive touchdown drives. Detroit are the only franchise to have a 0-16 season, when they went winless in 2008.
Josh Lambo kicked a 30-yard field goal with 3:12 remaining in overtime, lifting the Jacksonville Jaguars to a 20-17 victory against the Los Angeles Chargers.
Lambo’s kick was tipped at the line of scrimmage and still cleared the crossbar. The former soccer player ran the other way and slid on both knees near midfield before he was mobbed by team-mates. It gave Jacksonville their first three-game winning streak since 2013. The game ended up in overtime after a wild and wacky final two minutes of regulation that included a fumble, two interceptions, a taunting penalty and a costly flag for roughing the passer. At times, it looked as if neither team wanted to win.
Ryan Fitzpatrick led two long scoring drives and Tampa Bay limited the New York Jets to less than 200 yards of offense until late in the fourth quarter to snap a five-game losing streak with a 15-10 victory.
With Fitzpatrick filling in for injured quarterback Jameis Winston, the Buccaneers (3-6) used three field goals to build a 9-3 lead. Charles Sims put the game out of reach with a six-yard touchdown reception with just over six minutes remaining.
Fitzpatrick, facing the team he played for the past two seasons, completed 17 of 34 passes for 187 yards and was intercepted once. The 34-year-old Fitzpatrick, one of just four players in NFL history to throw TD passes for seven different teams, led a seven-minute drive that produced a field goal in the first quarter. He finished a 15-play, 81-yard march, also lasting more than seven minutes, with his TD pass to Sims to make it 15-3.
Marcus Mariota tossed a seven-yard touchdown pass to DeMarco Murray with 36 seconds left , and the Tennessee Titans rallied to beat the Cincinnati Bengals 24-20 Sunday for their fourth consecutive victory. It’s the longest winning streak for the Titans (6-3) since winning five straight in 2009, and it’s their best start to a season since 2008 when the Titans last reached the playoffs as the AFC’s No1 seed. Murray ran for two touchdowns, and Mariota finished with 264 yards passing.


Eric Dier has made a plea for people not to get carried with Ruben Loftus-Cheek’s display for England against Germany last Friday, describing his fellow midfielder as a player of great potential but who “still has a lot to work on”.
Loftus-Cheek was among five debutants who featured for England in the goalless draw with the world champions at Wembley and undeniably made the greatest impact. After a somewhat hesitant and loose start, the 21-year-old grew into proceedings and ended the evening being named man of the match.
That has understandably led to excitement regarding the impact Loftus-Cheek can make on Gareth Southgate’s side in the run-up to next summer’s World Cup, and will not come as a great surprise to those who have watched him develop at Chelsea, whom he joined at the age of eight, or perform for Crystal Palace this season having arrived on loan from the Premier League champions in July. Loftus-Cheek was also part of the England side, under Southgate, who won the Toulon Tournament in 2016.
“Everyone’s known about Ruben’s potential for a long time,” said Dier, who captained England for the first time against Germany. “It’s great that he’s now playing regular football week in, week out at Crystal Palace. That can only allow him to fulfil his potential. Hopefully this [his England debut] is another step in his progression.
“There’s so much more to come from him, but there’s no point getting too carried away at this point. He’s a good boy and he still has a lot to work on, like all of us.”
It will be intriguing to see if Southgate retains Loftus-Cheek in the side to face Brazil at Wembley evening and one facet the player certainly has in his favour compared to his midfield rivals, in the short and long-term, is his build. A little over 6ft 2in tall and 71kg in weight, Loftus-Cheek is an imposing, powerful presence.
“He’s a big boy, he’s been the same since he was 12, I think!” Dier said. “He’s strong, he’s got great physicality, and he moves the ball really well. There’s fantastic potential and hopefully he keeps working hard to fulfil it.”
Among the other players who made their England debuts last week was Jack Cork. The Burnley midfielder had to skip a family holiday to Dubai in order to join the squad but has no regrets and feels that after a long and varied career, which started at Chelsea prior to spells at, among others, Bournemouth, Southampton, Coventry and Swansea, not to mention representing England Under-21s and Great Britain’s 2012 Olympic team, he deserves his opportunity.
“I feel like I’ve done it hard,” the 28-year-old said. “I’ve done my graft and played all the games from League One to Championship – put myself out there. I’ve played enough games to have merited a chance and I’m just really happy the manager has trusted me to get in there.
“To come out at Wembley, against Germany, and get on the pitch in a big game like that is a dream. It’s one of the highest levels you can get and I’m dead chuffed to have got out there.”


The boos at the final whistle suggested that Denmark fans believed their team blew their best chance of World Cup qualification by failing to beat the Republic of Ireland in Copenhagen on Saturday but Nicklas Bendtner is confident he and his team-mates can instead reach Russia via Tuesday’s second leg in Dublin.
Bendtner confessed to being a little surprised by how defensive the Irish were on Saturday but is convinced that Martin O’Neill’s men will pursue victory with more abandon at home and, in doing so, will leave themselves vulnerable to the Danes. “I think it will be a different match,” says Bendtner.
“They know they can’t play a match where they have to stay so deep. They have to come out; they have to try to score. They can’t play a game of this importance for 0-0. I think they will come out a little more, which will allow us to get more space. In a way I think it will be a more interesting match to watch. Maybe we have a slight advantage given the fact that, if both teams score [in Dublin], we are going to be the ones going through, and that’s why this second game will be a little bit different.”
Bendtner admitted, however, that the first match did not pan out exactly how he expected. “I would say that Ireland didn’t really surprise us. We thought they would stay deep and defend as they’ve had great success with that but maybe we thought they would come out of the blocks and try to attack in more numbers rather just kick the ball away and hope to hit a player. But they defended with their lives as we’ve seen. We had three good chances; maybe we could have done better with some of them but they defended really well. They are strong so we have to match that on the away pitch and we have to take our chance and hopefully get a goal.”
That will be no simple feat, as the Republic have kept clean sheets in their last three matches. But it will not be easy for the Irish to score either and they, too, could be said to have missed an opportunity by not returning from Copenhagen with an away goal. The notion that they will be a far more fearsome force in Dublin is not based on their performances during the group stage, during which they played better on their travels and did not beat any of their main rivals in Dublin.
Their last really impressive win there was against Bosnia-Herzegovina two years ago – in the second leg of the play-offs for Euro 2016. Martin O’Neill’s team tend to be more comfortable playing off the back foot. They are not trying to impress anyone, quite happy to be awkward.
Shane Duffy, colossal again in Copenhagen at the heart of the Irish defence, does not envisage a radically different approach from his side for the second leg. “Well go in with the same game plan obviously, we’ll be hard to beat,” said the Brighton & Hove Albion centre-back. “We’ll be disciplined. We know we can score goals, we’re at home and we’ve got to go for it. But we’ve still got to respect them. They’ve got players who can cut you open. We’ve got to concentrate and that’s what we’ll do. You can’t get ahead of yourselves and go out all guns blazing and lose the match early on.
“We’ve got to respect the opposition a little bit. They’ve got quality and we’ve got to soak up their pressure and they soak up our pressure a little bit. We’ll try and stay in the game as long as we can and we’re confident we can score goals against them at home. It doesn’t matter how we get through as long as we do.”


The story has been told countless times: On 23 April 2003, Roman Abramovich was in attendance at Old Trafford to witness Manchester United beat Real Madrid 4-3 in the second leg of their Champions League quarter-final tie. It was an encounter full of drama and wonderful attacking play that not only contributed to the Spanish side progressing 6-5 on aggregate but Abramovich falling in love with football. The Russian, captivated and with billions burning in his back pocket, paid £140m for Chelsea three months later and changed the game in this country.
What is less known is that there was someone else watching on at Old Trafford that spring evening who would go on to have an impact on English football, less significantly but in its own way also an absorbing tale. He was five at the time, a United supporter who while disappointed by his team’s defeat was left elated and fascinated by what he had just seen, in particular by the contribution of Ronaldo (the original one), who scored a hat-trick and played with such verve and ruthlessness that he received a standing ovation from the majority of the crowd upon being substituted on 67 minutes. The five‑year-old was on his feet, too. His name? Marcus Rashford.
“My first ever game that I saw live, he [Ronaldo] was playing in it,” says the striker. “I always remember it; it was in 2003 and he scored a hat-trick. I was only young, but he was my brother’s favourite player, so I’ve grown up watching so much of him.”
That will come as little surprise to anyone who has observed Rashford develop since he gripped the national consciousness by scoring twice on his United debut in a 5-1 victory against FC Midtjylland in the Europa League some 21 months ago. His rise to ascendancy has been rapid ever since, with his attacking style built around clever movement and quick, confident, adventurous running.
Rashford has clearly been inspired by Ronaldo and it therefore understandably means a lot to the 20-year-old ahead of England’s friendly with Brazil at Wembley on Tuesday night, when he is expected to start for Gareth Southgate’s side, that the Seleção’s legendary No9 also sees a lot of himself in Rashford, saying as much last year before describing the forward as “courageous”, “fast” and “very good with the ball”.
Rashford says: “He was a top player who won a lot of things, so when he’s saying good things about you it really stands out. When you’re young you watch clips of the best players in the world and try to emulate them. With Ronaldo, I liked how he always played free. No matter where he was playing, he went out there and expressed himself. When you do that, that’s when you play your best football.”
It is debatable whether or not Rashford is playing his best football right now. The striker has scored eight times in 23 appearances for club and country this season and not at all in his last five. However, there have been mitigating circumstances. Since the previous international break last month, Rashford has started only four of United’s seven games and on one of those occasions was deployed in an unfamiliar wide-left role, while on the other three he was tasked with what is nowadays the unusual responsibility of operating in a two-man attack. It should also be noted that in his one outing for England since the national team’s 1-0 victory against Lithuania on 8 October – the goalless draw with Germany last Friday – Rashford only featured for half an hour, having come on as a second-half substitute.
It has all been a little disjointed and unstable for him, and so it says much about his talent and temperament that he has still shone, including during United’s recent win against Tottenham Hotspur at Old Trafford when Rashford performed with such menace that a notable section of the home supporters booed José Mourinho’s decision to withdraw him on 70 minutes.
Rashford lined up alongside Romelu Lukaku that afternoon and it bodes well for the player’s prospects at international level that he appears comfortable in a two-man frontline. Southgate deployed Jamie Vardy and Tammy Abraham as a forward pair against Germany and given England suddenly appear to have an encouraging number of strikers to select from, with Harry Kane, Daniel Sturridge and Rashford among those also in contention, it could be a formation the head coach perseveres with as he looks to reconfigure and refresh his team ahead of next summer’s World Cup.
“It’s a bit different but like anything new it takes a bit of getting used to,” says Rashford. “The more we do it the better we’ll become at it, so it’s just about familiarising ourselves with positions and responsibilities. Playing in a two is easier. It’s just about understanding each other’s games and building those relationships, which you can do off the pitch as well.”
Rashford’s next chance to stake his claim as an England regular comes against the nation that sits second in Fifa’s world rankings and has won the World Cup on a record five occasions. Ronaldo scored eight times as Brazil secured the most recent of those triumphs in 2002 and no doubt one of world football’s latest exciting young goalscorers will be hoping Ó Fenómeno is watching on and admiring his talents once again.


England’s football team might be put through a mock penalty shootout in front of a Wembley crowd as Gareth Southgate sets about trying to make sure his team will be fully prepared from 12 yards in the World Cup.
Southgate resisted the temptation to arrange a practice shootout against Germany, the team famous for their penalty prowess, after the goalless draw at Wembley on Friday but England’s manager is considering putting one in place for one of the Wembley friendlies closer to the tournament.
England have gone out of six major tournaments – three World Cups and three European Championships – since Chris Waddle skied his penalty in Italia 90 and have only one success to their name against Spain in Euro 96. Taking into account the King Hassan II International Cup in Morocco, pre-France 98, when Rob Lee and Les Ferdinand were the guilty men, England’s overall record stands at seven failures out of eight.
Sven-Goran Eriksson considered putting on a dress rehearsal when England played Jamaica at Old Trafford before the World Cup in 2006. The Swede never went through with it, however, and three of England’s penalty-takers, Frank Lampard, Steven Gerrard and Jamie Carragher, went on to miss in the quarter-final shootout against Portugal.
As anyone who can remember the pizza advert will be able to testify, Southgate also has first-hand experience from Euro 96 about what it is like to take, and miss, a decisive penalty in a major competition and the England manager is determined the modern team will be ready in next summer’s World Cup.
“It’s something that we are considering – how we prepare best for penalty shootouts,” Southgate said. “Whether that’s something on the training ground, whether that’s in sessions we do away from the training ground, or something we do in some sort of match scenario. We’ve not finalised that yet but clearly that [match situation] is an option.”
England have another friendly lined up against Italy at Wembley on 27 March, with a game against Holland in Amsterdam four days earlier, and will then arrange two more fixtures before the squad fly to their World Cup base in Repino, outside St Petersburg.
In the meantime Southgate is warning Joe Hart, the goalkeeper he insists is still his recognised No1, that he is facing increased competition after Jordan Pickford’s impressive debut against Germany.
Hart will return to the team for Tuesday’s friendly against Brazil at Wembley but Southgate confirmed the West Ham United goalkeeper would have missed out again if Jack Butland had not broken a finger.
“Jordan had an excellent game. It was a good experience for him, we can wrap him up now, assess him in the next period with his club and it’s good that he goes away with a really positive experience. Now’s an opportunity for Joe to have experience against top opposition as well and we’re all aware there’s really good competition in that area of the pitch.
“We have six months where all our goalkeeping department can show what they can do. What Jordan has shown is that he’s been able to make his debut at Wembley, play with composure and show his qualities. He’s still a young goalkeeper, still learning, and there are things for him to improve but it was a really positive debut.”


Michael O’Neill condemned the “cruelty” of Northern Ireland’s World Cup play-off defeat by Switzerland after they were ultimately denied a place in Russia by the controversial first-leg penalty. The Northern Ireland manager also insisted it was too soon to say whether elimination marked the end of an era for himself and several senior players.
Northern Ireland produced a vastly improved performance in Basel but a goalless draw sent Switzerland through to a fourth consecutive World Cup finals thanks to Ricardo Rodríguez’s penalty in Belfast. Rodríguez was also on hand to clear a Jonny Evans header off the line in stoppage time in the second leg, increasing Northern Ireland’s torment.
“I wasn’t aware it was Rodríguez but the cruelty is in the poorness of the decision that means we are missing out on the chance to go to a World Cup,” a distraught O’Neill said. “That is the cruelty. We should still be playing extra time now, that is the reality. Yes, Switzerland were the better team in the first leg but they didn’t score other than the penalty.
“We were the better team tonight. For us to miss out because of that mistake, at this level and with those group of players who’ve given everything, is extremely cruel. We should be out on the pitch now fighting for a place in Russia.”
O’Neill revealed several Northern Ireland players were in tears in the dressing room after the game and that, for the likes of 38-year-old Aaron Hughes and 37-year-old Gareth McAuley, their dreams of playing at a World Cup are, in effect, over.
The manager said: “My first emotion is absolute devastation. It would have been disappointing if we’d just lost but it is devastating because of the manner of how we lost and the goal that decided the tie. I couldn’t have asked for more from the players. Their level of performance was phenomenal and I told them afterwards it was a privilege to be their manager tonight.
“After five and a half years this is clearly a devastating moment but in terms of the character of a team it is also a high point. We went toe to toe with a team that reached the last 16 of the last Euros and the last World Cup and the tie has been decided by a penalty that should never have been. The players are emotional and upset. There were some players in tears afterwards. Everyone was struggling to hold back their emotions. For some of these players it’s unlikely the World Cup will come around again.”
Oliver Norwood, the Northern Ireland midfielder, put it succinctly. “Shafted is the only word for it,” he said. “It’s not just the penalty decision as the tackle Fabian Schär made on Stuart Dallas in Belfast was a red card. I will think about the penalty decision for years to come as it’s the only goal between the two sides and it’s knocked us out.”
O’Neill’s future with Northern Ireland is open to doubt given his outstanding achievements at international level. Scotland are believed to be keen to lure the Edinburgh-based manager to replace Gordon Strachan, but O’Neill insisted no one connected with Northern Ireland needs to decide their futures in the immediate aftermath of the play-off exit.
“I haven’t even considered that,” he said. “I am under contract until 2020 and tonight is about being with my players, spending time with them and making sure they are OK. I said to the players there is no need to make any rash decisions on anything they want to do. They have given everything.
“They will make decisions going forward. Certainly the likes of Aaron and Gareth at 38 and 37, and Chris Brunt, these players have had long and established Northern Ireland careers but, for me, they have time to make that decision.
“We don’t have a qualifier until next March so there is lot of time for that, and certainly at this moment in time it’s not a decision to be made. I am not thinking any further ahead than just being with the players.”


Croatia are in the World Cup finals after a 0-0 away draw on Sunday night put them through with a 4-1 aggregate across the two legs of their qualifying play-off with Greece.
Zlatko Dalic’s side made sure of a place in Russia next summer by closing out a dour game that contained few chances. Dalic had been appointed in October after Croatia sacked their previous manager, Ante Cacic, following a 1-1 draw with Finland towards the end of the group stages of qualifying.
Greece’s coach, Michael Skibbe, made six changes to the team that lost heavily in the first leg and the home side produced a much better performance this time. However, although Greece dominated possession, they never really looked like scoring and their one shot on target, an effort by Panagiotis Tachtsidis, was comfortably saved by Danijel Subasic.
The result in Piraeus means Croatia have qualified for 10 out of 12 major tournaments since the Balkan state was founded in 1991. They have also won all five of their play-off ties to reach either World Cup or European Championship tournaments.
There were no Croatia fans at the match, as both sides, fearful of possible violence, had agreed to ban away supporters from each leg.


One might have thought all would be overshadowed by a 13th consecutive defeat against opponents who, while unquestionably better, are not in a different league, but the prospect of losing Jonathan Davies for the rest of this autumn series hung heavier over the Wales camp.
As if they did not already know it had not been their day against Australia – again – such a feeling was reinforced when Davies went down in the last play of the game, seeming to twist his ankle in a tackle. He received treatment after the final whistle, and the look on his face as he was carted off was not encouraging. He finished the evening strapped up and on crutches. Warren Gatland admitted his situation “doesn’t look brilliant”.
His loss would be a terrible blow when the All Blacks come to town the weekend after next. Wales are as in transition as any team in this midpoint between World Cups, and are without a host of key personnel anyway. Davies’s presence in a post‑Jamie Roberts midfield feels vital to the smoothness of that transition.
Not only are Australia not in a different league from Wales, they are in the same pool, for the second time running, at the next World Cup, which ought to make the relentless familiarity of Wales’s results against them cause more than a little concern. Gatland and his captain, Alun Wyn Jones, insisted that there was no mental block. Indeed, the mood was, on balance, positive, such was the promise of much of Wales’s approach play, their handling failing them on a few occasions as the call for the killer blow approached.
“I think there is a lot be excited about,” said Jake Ball, Jones’s second-row partner. “There has been a freshness among the squad, new guys bringing new things.”
Certainly, Wales know what it is to be unlucky against Australia, even if the regularity of their misfortune suggests something else is at work. This time they had cause to curse the failure of the officials, including the TMO, to spot Kurtley Beale’s knock-on just before he cantered clear for the breakaway try that killed off their hopes of overturning what was then a six-point lead.
Wales were commendably sanguine about the whole affair, Gatland rightly describing it as a “freak try”. Instead, they preferred to focus on their own mistakes, while remaining positive about the subtler layers developing in their attacking game. “There were some errors in our 22 that probably cost us the game,” Ball said. “I don’t think there was a big difference between the two of us. We probably pushed a few offloads. We are trying to develop that bit of X‑factor, but I think there is a point to going through the phases. When we did that we achieved some good things.”
Ultimately, what elevated Australia, as ever, was the conversion of chances. Like Wales, they were experimenting with their midfield, in their case packing it with heavy cavalry, but it remains their consummate ball players who wield the influence. Beale, withdrawn from centre to full-back in the absence of Israel Folau, secured the game with his brilliant devilry at the start of the final quarter, scoring his controversial try by burgling the ball from Steff Evans, who was otherwise excellent, finishing the try of the day on his first home appearance.
Australia’s half-backs, Will Genia and Bernard Foley, had masterminded three first-half tries, the highlight being Genia’s beautiful flat pass to pick out Adam Coleman for the second, after Foley’s wicked improvised chip had created havoc in Wales’s defence. Another brilliant Foley kick had set up the lineout and drive from which Australia scored their first, while all three ball-players played a part in the third, on the stroke of half-time.
In between the first and second tries, Wales replied with a beauty of their own, which earned them a brief lead, Evans finishing sharply after Gareth Davies’s break had set up a position from which neat hands conveyed the ball to Evans’s wing. It will be of some concern that it was not until two minutes from time that they managed it again, Hallam Amos squeezing into the corner, having replaced the limping Evans after Beale’s burglary.
That fourth Aussie try did put the game beyond Wales’s reach – and it shouldn’t have stood. Beale knew it, drop-kicking the conversion before the ref had awarded the try. Later, slow-motion replays, which did not appear to be available to the TMO, clearly showed he had dropped the ball for a split-second after smuggling it from Evans’s grasp. Beale was lucky, but he was witty too, the whole incident a series of outrageous unorthodoxies. Wales must learn to make their own luck in the same way.


To say the weekend’s other games in Cardiff, Dublin and Paris put England’s opening autumn effort into sharp perspective is the understatement of the season. When Eddie Jones called it “a grindathon” he was being generous and the contest with Australia on Saturday will end unhappily unless his team show more dynamism up front and locate some rhythm behind. The frustrated head coach’s blunt second-half outburst – “How fucking stupid are we?” – did not bode well, either.
As anyone who stayed awake long enough will testify there was, literally, a yawning gap between England’s pre‑match rhetoric and what they ultimately delivered at Twickenham. One post-match suggestion was that it was all a devilish Jones masterplan to lull the Wallabies into a sense of false security.
In fairness England’s defence was largely excellent and Sam Underhill and Nathan Hughes both enhanced their reputations in the back row. England remain unbeaten at home under Jones and have now won 20 of their 21 internationals since the Australian took over. Against the Wallabies, even so, England will be under pressure to disprove the niggling theory that their rate of progress is slowing and that they are overly reliant on their three Saracens’ musketeers, Owen Farrell, Maro Itoje and the injured Billy Vunipola.
That was certainly the verdict of the Twickenham jury on Saturday, with the stadium atmosphere about as animated as a fortnightly bridge night in Stow-on-the-Wold. England’s backs appeared to have been only recently introduced to each other and by far the most dramatic flourish came when a frustrated Jones was caught on camera slamming down his notebook like a holidaymaker who has reached the check-in desk only to realise all his family’s passports are sitting on the kitchen table.
Without the arrival of one or two lively English substitutes, most notably Alex Lozowski whose swift identification of a midfield mismatch established the bridgehead from which Semesa Rokoduguni, still a serving soldier in the British Army, scored his clinching try, it would have been the least memorable of Remembrance weekend games. Even that did not assist Jones much; if Lozowski starts it can only be instead of either Farrell or George Ford while Rokoduguni’s three tries in three Tests have taken three years to amass.
There was, in short, very little of the collective urgency displayed by Ireland against South Africa in Dublin, a game which also subverted many of the available excuses for England’s sluggishness. All the Irish Lions looked bang up for it, their midfield made a major impact and Joe Schmidt’s side look to be on the up. England, restricted to 37% possession, may officially be the world’s second highest-ranked team but, rust or no rust, they are not consistently playing like it.
That is probably reason enough to recall Farrell, a water-boy on Saturday, and Itoje to the starting XV to face the Wallabies. Assuming Mike Brown recovers sufficiently from a nasty early tumble and Jonny May’s hamstring recovers, Jones will then have a key judgment call to make. While Henry Slade did not enjoy his greatest day in a home midfield handicapped by the twin shackles of slow ball and limited game-time together, there remains a good case for starting him at No13 alongside Farrell and retaining Lozowski on the bench for another second-half flourish.
Jones is yet to confirm anything, other than to say he wants “Australia to bring their best game to Twickenham and then see if we can handle it”. Jamie George, Ellis Genge and Harry Williams, all powerful ball-carriers, must be given at least one starting opportunity this month – and Joe Marler is available again – while the back-row balance remains a conundrum. Underhill and Chris Robshaw do plenty of donkey work but Jones must be increasingly tempted to try Courtney Lawes on the blindside flank.
If Hughes were to go down in the first minute against Australia, it will be a big ask for Exeter’s Sam Simmonds to do the back-row carrying single-handed. On Saturday Hughes carried for 79 metres, more than all the other seven members of the pack and the forward replacements combined.
At least Simmonds has his precious first cap, which he celebrated by singing Build Me Up Buttercup in the dressing room rather than on the team bus as tradition now dictates. England also now sing a team song written by May but, outside the dressing room, Saturday’s entertainment was mostly to be found at the bottom of a glass. The priciest seats for the Australia game now cost £127 and, if England are not flying, the mood can swiftly turn grumpy. There was not even an appetite for a quick burst of “Swing Low”, probably on the basis that, if the hosts dipped any lower, they would be subterranean.
Then again, as Jones rightly observed, that is the game of rugby sometimes. With Hughes’ one-handed catch for his first try when the Pumas were down to 14 men, Lozowski’s sharp break, the spectacular restart work of Argentina’s winger Ramiro Moyano and one lovely flick from the great Juan Martín Hernández on his final Twickenham Test appearance, the afternoon was not entirely bereft of charm.
It is also possible to argue England were fortunate in places, with Joaquín Tuculet unlucky to be sent to the sin-bin for his genuine attempt to compete with Brown in the air, and Slade’s scoring pass to Rokoduguni sparking another tedious GCSE physics debate about momentum and stuff being thrown from moving trains. If Michael Cheika’s Australia are to be halted in their tracks this weekend, their hosts will have to improve significantly.


British Gymnastics is facing a crisis with its biggest stars, including the double Olympic champion Max Whitlock, refusing to sign World Class Performance Programme contracts and being threatened with having their funding withdrawn.
An internal power struggle between the performance, commercial and management teams about the content of the contract has led to a rebellion among the athletes. The Guardian understands almost all of the team which won a record seven medals at the Rio Olympics last summer have refused to sign the contract. The entire men’s artistic squad, including Whitlock who became the first Briton to defend a world title successfully last month, have refused to sign. On the women’s side, the Olympic medallist Amy Tinkler and the European champion Ellie Downie have not signed.
British Gymnastics said in a statement that it was currently “involved in consultation” with the athletes regarding the World Class Performance Programme agreements. It added: “To date, over 50% of the athletes on our World Class Performance Programme have already signed the agreement. The process is still ongoing and due to finish at the end of November. British Gymnastics is working hard to ensure that all athletes are comfortable with the agreement before signing because we respect their views on matters that directly impact them.”
In August the athletes were warned they had three days to put pen to paper or would risk having their UK Sport funding withdrawn. But scores of parents and athlete agents wrote to British Gymnastics to voice concern about the content of the Individual Athlete Plan part of the contract, which they claim would have left the gymnasts open to exploitation. They were then told that the contract would be revisited after the world championships which took place in Montreal last month.
One insider described the situation as “complete chaos, evidence of weak leadership and British Gymnastics’ need for complete control over the athletes. They are the most important people in the sport but once again they feel they’re being exploited. To be a world-class gymnast all you need is the athlete, coach and the gym and they want to know where all the money is going.” It is understood there will be showdown talks between British Gymnastics and the athletes on Tuesday as the governing body tries to find a resolution to the problem.
Separately the Guardian has spoken to several senior coaches who called for the resignation of British Gymnastics’ chief executive, Jane Allen, claiming her “appalling leadership” has created a “culture of fear” where people are afraid to speak up about athlete welfare failings for fear of reprisals.
The coaches, who between them have led gymnasts to many European, world and Olympic competitions over the past 30 years, paint a picture of an organisation ruled by favouritism and where athlete and coach welfare is relegated behind medals.
An email written by the veteran coach John Pirrie on behalf of some of the 90 coaches he works with as a consultant and circulated widely in gymnastic circles calls for Allen to “fall on her sword”.
“It is time for fresh leadership,” wrote Pirrie. “In view of the catastrophic failings over which you, Jane Allen, preside, your position has become untenable in the eyes of too many.”
Among seven bullet points designed to illustrate British Gymnastics’ shortcomings, Pirrie stated: “It appears that some favoured coaches, well known to have used cruel and manipulative strategies on elite gymnasts, continue to work without sanction in British Gymnastics-registered clubs.”
The individuals whom the Guardian spoke to said they considered Britain’s performance at the Rio Olympics to have been despite – rather than because – of the governing body. As a result of that success their UK Sport funding increased by more than £2m to £16.7m for the four-year cycle to Tokyo 2020, with an additional £8.3m from Sport England to develop the sport at grassroots level. British Gymnastics was even named national governing body of the year at the BT Sport Industry Awards in 2016.
But that award was regarded as close to parody by many within the sport. “Key persons in the sport feel that the ‘governing body of the year award’ is a total farce,” wrote Pirrie, in his email to Allen, “conning UK Sport into believing that the association’s leadership is peerless and we are one big happy family. This couldn’t be further from the truth.”
The Guardian revealed earlier this year that British Gymnastics did not suspend a coach who was reported to its welfare team for alleged emotional and physical abuse in 2012. The same coach was interviewed by police this year on suspicion of child cruelty. Another coach told the Guardian British Gymnastics was considered “complicit” with athlete abuse after it failed to remove a coach who was found to have sent an inappropriate picture to a junior gymnast.
“This coach was body shaming a child yet remains in his job,” said one individual, who requested to remain anonymous. “By not doing anything to punish him British Gymnastics is complicit in this abuse. There has been a lot made of athlete welfare cases at British Cycling and quite rightly but in many ways this is worse. These are children we’re talking about and you’re putting them off the sport for life. British Gymnastics is responsible for that.”
Another coach said it was a prevailing opinion among senior coaches that the governing body is not fit for purpose. “There is a culture of fear and people worry about going against the grain because of the possibility of reprisals, of athletes and coaches not being selected because their face doesn’t fit.
“British Gymnastics take duty of care seriously when it suits them,” the coach added. “I’ve seen first hand coaches who are not in favour being suspended more than once for relatively trivial issues. On the other hand, coaches are allowed to get away with abuse cases because they are favourites among the British Gymnastics hierarchy and cosy up to those in power.”
British Gymnastics strongly rejects the accusations, saying: “British Gymnastics has a track record of good governance as evidenced by our adherence to the UK Sport ‘Code of Sports Governance’.
“We have robust governance policies and procedures to cover safeguarding, complaints, standards of conduct and GB team selections, all available online. We ensure all complaints and appeals regardless of their nature are dealt with fairly and effectively where we have the authority to act, with independent assurance of this as necessary. Anyone with a concern or complaint should come forward and we can assure them the matter would be dealt with impartially.
“The chief executive, Jane Allen, leads an organisation committed to creating and inspiring lasting success for gymnastics, as well as driving through important and positive change.”


Roger Federer eased past Jack Sock in two sets on the opening day of the ATP World Tour Finals on Sunday, then calmed concerns about the playing future of the absent champion, Andy Murray – an upbeat view in sharp contrast to gloomy prognoses by Tim Henman and Andrew Castle.
While Murray’s British friends fear his injured hip could bring his career to a premature close, Federer, who played the Scot on his return from four months off the Tour in an exhibition match in Glasgow on Tuesday, has no such worries.
“Considering he has been totally out of the spotlight, it was a brave move for him to put himself out there, give it a go,” said Federer, who had just beaten Sock 6-4, 7-6 (4). “Nobody really knew how he was doing. I was happy how he was playing. Definitely he can move better, he can serve better. We know all these things. For a start it was quite encouraging and OK.
“He still has a lot of time before Australia comes around. Only he knows at what level he wants to return to competition. But I thought he was actually pretty good. I didn’t expect him to be this good yet.”
Earlier, however, Henman told the BBC: “You see him walking around in between points or away from the court, the limp is quite pronounced. Then when you see him moving on the court, his movement is improving. I still think he’s got a long way to go to get back and be 100%.”
Castle said: “I tried to find out a few things about his hip. The team doesn’t give too much away. He’s doing his best to be ready to go out to Australia and to acclimatise. But, look, I’ve got a metal hip. The hip is bad news. It ties up the top half and the bottom half. You need it. I’m very worried about Andy’s future in the game because of the area that is clearly troubling him. Fingers crossed he will be able to come back.”
Federer, meanwhile, began his pursuit of a seventh title here in impressive style. There were a few mis-hits, some dazzling winners and the result that many among the 20,000 fans present were hoping for against Sock, the American underdog who had to win the final in Paris last week to make the final eight here.
“It was really just a matter of trying to keep the ball in play,” Federer said afterwards of the challenge of defusing Sock’s rocket-like serves after soaking up 11 aces.
“It’s always a struggle early in a tournament. After a while you’re just happy to hit some good strokes. The second set was tight. The breaker could have gone either way but he helped me with a double fault and some mistakes.”
On his performance he said: “I was serving well, didn’t have too many problems in the second set. That was a good win for me, because it was tricky. He served big: 105mph, 110, 115 sometimes on the second serve.
“I’ve been coming over on the return on the backhand for a while, the bigger racket helps, and it’s also about more confidence. I didn’t serve and volley as much I would like today. If you come in, the more time you spend at the net you find the more points there are there. It’s a great option to have. If it doesn’t work, don’t do it.”
The first set came briefly to life in the sixth game when Federer butchered a routine volley at the net on game point – distracted possibly by the American turning his back and showing him his backside. There was an exchange of grins on the changeover but, when serious business resumed, the Swiss completed the job. As Federer observed later: “It looks very easy. I don’t know what happened.”
Sock was more competitive early in the second set before the strain told. A double fault cost him break point in the sixth game, he had to settle his nerves at 4-3 and needed to save twice to hold for 5-4.
Federer held to love, a deft volley at the net then getting him a sixth break point. Sock wriggled out of trouble with his final ace but the end arrived when he double-faulted in the tie-break for the sixth time in the match before slapping a tired forehand long and a fraught contest was done after an hour and a half.


Scotland’s Katie Archibald faces an interesting dilemma in the run-in to next year’s world championships after being Great Britain’s stand-out star of the Manchester World Cup, adding gold medals in the Madison and team pursuit to her silver of Friday night in the omnium, where she is the reigning world champion.
With the Madison now an Olympic event, and the omnium format changed to make it more attractive for endurance riders – as well as for the crowds – the issue for Archibald will be whether to go for all three events in Apeldoorn, the Netherlands, at the end of February.
“The definite ambition is anything that is an Olympic medal, so we want to be good at team pursuit, Madison and omnium,” said the 23-year-old from Milngavie. “I always assume that you aim for the best even for all three but I understand that there may be a compromise at some point in one of them.”
On Sunday Archibald with her fellow Olympic champion Elinor Barker and the newcomers Emily Nelson and Neah Evans - the 27-year-old is also a Scot, a former hill runner who has only joined Great Britain this season – gave Great Britain their third gold medal of the weekend, dominating the Italian quartet in a rapid 4min 16.803, their fastest time since Rio.
The winning margin of almost 5sec was impressive, so too the fact that the line-up had been reshuffled for the morning’s second round, with Manon Lloyd and Emily Kay replacing Archibald and Barker, who had every right to require a rest after their gold medal in the Madison the previous evening.
“Myself and Elinor had never ridden with Neah before,” Archibald said. “ It was an unknown. There’s a lot more to come. The big contrast between this Olympic cycle and the last has been the technical skill of the young riders. We’ve got this really wide bank of really skilled riders, Neah is probably the exception to that in terms of proving her speed in bunch races and putting it into the speciality of team pursuit.”
Strength in depth should stand Great Britain in good stead in the run-in to next spring’s world championships in the Netherlands, when a better idea of the hierarchy post-Rio will emerge with the other English-speaking nations – Australia, Canada and the US – likely to provide much stiffer competition. But the conundrum Archibald may face is definitely a healthy one.
The men’s endurance side continues to blossom, with Saturday night’s 3min 55sec ride by Ed Clancy, Stephen Burke, Oliver Wood and Kian Emadi more than promising and the emergence of the national champions, Team KGF, clearly shaking the tree, something the Great Britain performance director, Stephen Park, welcomed, for one.
No contender as obvious as Archibald has emerged for the Madison and omnium and it remains to be seen whether stars of the road such as Mark Cavendish put their hats in the ring as Tokyo approaches. In Sunday’s closing Madison, Mark Stewart and Chris Latham rode bravely but were ultimately outgunned in sixth place.
In other events Callum Skinner was not far off breaking the magic one-minute barrier for the kilometre time trial en route to a bronze medal that looks promising with the Commonwealth Games on the horizon. He was, however, unable to get close to the stand-out sprinter of this autumn, the Australian Michael Glaetzer, who became the first man to break the minute at sea-level for the four laps, and who could well emerge as a star in the Gold Coast in April.
With Jason Kenny still to return in the new year and Jack Carlin, Ryan Owens and Joe Truman showing promising form here, there are clearly reserves among Britain’s male sprinters, although the women’s sprint events – where Great Britain did manage a medal over the weekend – look set to prove more of a headache.


Michael O’Neill resembled a mourner at a funeral as he walked across a mud-splattered pitch in Switzerland wearing a long black coat to console his distraught players. How apt. The dream of a first World Cup appearance in 32 years has died for Northern Ireland and all because of a disgraceful penalty decision in Belfast three days earlier. It may prove the end of an era, not simply of another remarkable campaign.
Northern Ireland held their own against the team ranked 11th in the world and were agonisingly close to taking the play-off to extra time when Jonny Evans’s injury-time header sailed goalwards. Yann Sommer, the Switzerland goalkeeper, was awol having missed Chris Brunt’s deep cross but Ricardo Rodríguez came to his country’s rescue with a clearance on the line. It would have to be Rodríguez, who scored the controversial penalty that ultimately decided the team heading to Russia next summer. Another cruel twist for O’Neill and his players.
“The cruelty is in the poorness of the decision that means we are missing out on the chance to go to a World Cup,” the Northern Ireland manager said. “That is the cruelty. We should still be out there playing extra time.”
Northern Ireland’s sense of injustice will harden given the consequence of Ovidiu Hategan’s incompetence but O’Neill was rightly proud of how it was channelled in Basel. Several parallels with last summer’s European Championship defeat of Ukraine gave cause for optimism before kick-off and, if that appeared wishful thinking in the face of a daunting predicament, it was substantiated by a vastly improved second-leg performance. If only the result had been the same.
As he did after the opening group defeat by Poland last summer, O’Neill replaced the physicality of Kyle Lafferty, plus Josh Magennis, with the energy of Conor Washington and Jamie Ward, to telling effect. He also recalled Aaron Hughes at right‑back, thereby making the 38-year-old the most capped home nations defender of all time, surpassing Bobby Moore’s record of 108 international appearances.
There was also a torrential downpour in Basel to echo the hailstorm that temporarily halted proceedings in Lyon. The pitch at St Jakob-Park was sodden and inspected twice before the game was given the go-ahead. Northern Ireland players conducted their warm-up around ground staff who were throwing buckets of sand on to the pitch to absorb visible patches of water. Passing was inevitably complicated, although Northern Ireland’s recovery was the most striking feature here.
With Washington working tirelessly across the front line, Oliver Norwood shining in central midfield and Gareth McAuley commanding in central defence, the visitors rediscovered the form that secured a runners-up spot in qualifying. Granit Xhaha’s pre-match assertion that Switzerland’s fortunate penalty would prove an irrelevance to the overall result was quickly in doubt. O’Neill’s side did not manage one shot on target in the first leg. Here they created four decent openings inside 16 minutes, stinging the goalkeeper Sommer’s palms twice.
Stuart Dallas, starting despite leaving Windsor Park on crutches on Thursday as a consequence of an ankle injury, had a good early chance to level the tie but headed into the side-netting from a Steven Davis cross, colliding with Ward as he leapt. Sommer saved twice from Brunt when the left-back let fly from distance and Dallas steered a half volley just over from a Norwood corner.
Switzerland grew into the game and, once they had adjusted to the testing playing conditions, created numerous chances to extend their advantage. Thanks to Michael McGovern’s goalkeeping and wayward finishing, they failed and were ultimately indebted to a penalty that should never have been given for their fourth consecutive appearance at a World Cup finals.
A Northern Ireland defence with a combined age of 136 was always vulnerable to Switzerland’s runners but the experience of Hughes, McAuley and Jonny Evans came to the fore as they survived sustained pressure at the start of the second half. Rodríguez sent an angled drive just wide of the far post, Hughes blocked from Steven Zuber and McAuley did likewise when the Hoffenheim winger latched on to Stephan Lichtsteiner’s free‑kick into the penalty area.
O’Neill’s team, as always, fought back. Washington’s header, from Ward’s right-wing cross, flashed just wide of Sommer’s goal. The QPR striker then created a clear opening for the impressive George Saville, having turned away from Fabian Schär down the left, but the Millwall midfielder shot tamely at the Switzerland keeper.
The Northern Ireland manager threw on Magennis, pushed McAuley into the attack and tried to bombard the home penalty area in the final stages. He was prepared to risk space at the back in search of that vital goal and Haris Seferovic should have capitalised but skied dreadfully over with only McGovern to beat. The miss triggered jeers from the home crowd towards their own striker, and an angry reaction from the Switzerland bench at them in return but they were united in relief when Rodríguez made his vital clearance in injury time.
O’Neill sought his opposite number, Vladimir Petkovic, after the final whistle, embraced him and then made the long walk to the tunnel alone, his World Cup dream over. Cruelly. What next?


Chris Rogers chose “weaknesses”, Ryan Harris went for “vulnerable”, and Trevor Bayliss spoke of “concerns”. None of these are words a touring team want said about their batting at the best of times, let alone when they are entering Queensland 11 days from a Test at the Gabbatoir, where, of course, Australia have not lost for 29 years.
For England, however, such words are indisputable – they have problems with their batting from top to bottom. Alastair Cook is beyond rusty; three of the top five have played fewer than seven Tests; their engine room of all-rounders is missing its spearhead, Ben Stokes, while Moeen Ali is yet to play a game on tour; Stokes’s absence also compromises their depth (which has bailed them out so often in recent years) and exposes the elongated tail, which faces the prospect of the Big Bad Wolf Mitchell Starc, who blows them away with relish; they collapse at both ends – in the first innings in Adelaide they lost their last five for 22, and in the second the first seven went for 45; they are yet to score a century on tour.
Let’s open up by opening up. Cook, says Bayliss, “would be the first to admit that he always looks a bit rusty”. He has 47 runs in three innings, and looks exceptionally scratchy. “It’s a concern for any individual batter I suppose at different times through their career, but with Cook having played almost 150 Tests, I’m sure he’s been through this before.”
Pleasingly for Bayliss, Cook’s callower colleagues have spent time in the middle but, more irksomely, are making a habit of giving away starts. “The No1 thing for us is that 60s are not enough. We need 160s,” he said, with a nudge for Mark Stoneman (three half-centuries), James Vince (an 82 and two starts) and Dawid Malan (two fifties), adding that he hoped the intensity of the competition in Brisbane would “really kick the batters into gear”.
The long, lush outfield in Adelaide – grown out for an International Rules football match at the ground on Sunday (Australia beat Ireland) – did not help, Bayliss believes: “Seeing the ball racing away on a shorter outfield gives you confidence, and we weren’t afforded that.” He hopes that a flat pitch in Townsville, which is said to ape that of the Gabba, will help his batsmen break their century duck. They know not what lies in store in Townsville – England have not been here for 55 years. Then, the tour manager, Bernard, the Duke of Norfolk, had to fly home to prepare Winston Churchill’s funeral, although the former prime minister did not die until January 1965.
Stoneman and Malan have looked accomplished, but the number of ways Australia can prey on Vince is a worry. Rogers, who coached England’s opposition’s batsmen last week, believes that how such players fare compared to their Australian counterparts, like Matt Renshaw and Peter Handscomb, will decide the series, as the likes of Steve Smith and Joe Root might cancel each other out. The three Englishmen “have definitely got weaknesses in their games,” said Rogers, adding: “If you asked all the England players how the Australians will bowl at them, they know. It’s not going to be a surprise out there. It’s just how they deal with those tactics.”
Of Vince, Rogers said: “He’s exceptionally talented, but can be frustrating with his modes of dismissal. Watching this game, he’s one of the better players of pace England have. Is he going to get that big hundred or those 30s or 40s? Only he can answer that. No doubt he has the skill, but does he have the mental ability to be a big player in this series? No3 is a big position, because it allows Root to come in later. That’s key for both sides. How late can Smith and Root come in? Because if they are facing the new ball that could be a big difference.”
Further down, with Jake Ball out of action for a week or so, Craig Overton – who is bowling very nicely – looks likely to make his debut at Brisbane and, although he got a pair in Adelaide, Rogers believes his batting (he has a first-class century and a 99, although his top score this summer was 44 not out) should be taken into account, because with Starc circling, England cannot afford a diplodocus’s tail.
“He can hold a bat,” said Rogers of a player he has captained and coached at Somerset. “That might be a worry for England if Ball is fit and they do pick him, it would be Ball, Broad and Anderson and you’d worry it would be seven out, all out. They might think about that. He [Overton] can hold a bat, but whether he can hold a bat against Mitchell Starc reverse-swinging yorkers, I don’t know.”
All of which paints the picture of an order that, as Rogers says, “is hardly blazing”. The collapses are perhaps most grating of all for Bayliss, because they are a zit England just cannot pop. “It’s been a concern for a little while,” he says. “We have games where we lose wickets like that, and it is a concern. We have a reasonably inexperienced lineup when it comes to international cricket but they are learning all the time. It’s not for want of trying. They realise they have got to do better and they are working hard to do that.”
Time, they all know, is very much of the essence.


Italy’s beleaguered coach, Gian Piero Ventura, said his team would try to qualify for the World Cup in Russia by “playing football” after their ill-tempered play-off first leg against Sweden on Monday.
Ventura said it would take him months to listen to all the advice he had received as he bids to overturn Friday’s 1-0 first leg defeat in Stockholm.
That loss left Italy in danger of missing a World Cup finals for the first time in 60 years and the tension ahead of the return game at the San Siro is palpable.
Italy complained of rough play by Sweden in the first leg, including a challenge which left defender Leonardo Bonucci with a broken nose, while Sweden were unhappy at their rivals’ alleged gamesmanship. Bonucci will play wearing a face mask.
“We are Italy and, if we qualify, I would like to be able to say that we did it by playing football,” Ventura said. “I don’t know what sort of game it will be but I hope it will be played in the correct spirit.”
Ventura’s tactics and team selection have been the subject of heated debate. He ditched his preferred 4-2-4 formation for a 3-5-2 in Friday’s match and Italians are eager to see what he will come up with and who will replace suspended midfielder Marco Verratti.
“I’ve received so much advice in the last few days that, if I tried to listen to it all, it would take months,” said Ventura. “I know that’s how it works when you are coach of the national team although I didn’t expect it to be quite like this. I can assure you that coaches listen to advice and analyse it, but it is us who decide.”
Italy’s veteran goalkeeper and captain, Gianluigi Buffon, said the team were in a state of “high tension”.
“We can make no mistakes, we are focusing on what we must do to win but if we fail to qualify everybody should take the blame. We are not stressed, personally I am focused on the game and I hope fans will support us. Sweden are a solid side and their behaviour will make little difference, it all depends on us,” he said.
“We know we can win this game, we dream to qualify for the World Cup, it’s an important game for us and for the history of the national team.
“I’ve already faced similar situations in my career, sometimes I’ve succeeded, some other times I’ve failed. The game means a lot for all of us, not only for me. My situation is not important at the moment. It would be a great satisfaction to qualify for the World Cup.”


The Formula One world championship may have been decided but there were still pertinent points to be made at the Brazilian Grand Prix. Sebastian Vettel and Ferrari had seen the title slip away but managed to lay down their marker for next season with a commanding victory at Interlagos. Lewis Hamilton, with his fourth F1 championship already under his belt, gave his all for fourth place here after starting in the pitlane, delivering a strident reminder to his rivals that his pace and racecraft are at an absolute peak.
Vettel won at the Autódromo José Carlos Pace, a commanding performance to beat the Mercedes of Valtteri Bottas into second, with Kimi Raikkonen taking third. Hamilton, crowned champion in Mexico, had crashed in qualifying but fought back with a determined and aggressive drive.
Vettel’s challenge for the title fell away in the space of three races – his crash at Singapore, engine change in Malaysia and a spark plug failure in Japan – and he wanted a strong finish to the season. There was some relief then that the Scuderia had finally delivered. “We are in a position to fight for victory, we won here, two cars on the podium. I think there’s a lot of positives. Of course if you miss out it sort of sucks,” he said. “I think we can all feel that we’re getting stronger so hopefully we can carry that strength into the next couple of years, not just next year, not just the winter but also the future because I think our objective is to bring Ferrari back properly, get there and dominate.”
The win will be of some solace for Vettel and Ferrari. He had said on Saturday that they would have “failed” if they did not secure second place in the championship, behind Hamilton. He was 15 points ahead of Bottas and now goes into the final round in Abu Dhabi with a 22-point lead and that place almost assured.
Hamilton, too, enjoyed his afternoon. Having fitted a new powerunit overnight in order to run the engine at maximum output – which his lap times demonstrated was ominously strong – he made the most of it and came through the field with a series of decisive moves.
“It was fun, reminiscent of my karting days when I was starting from the back,” he said. “On one side I messed up yesterday and put myself in the worst position. My goal today was to try and redeem myself from yesterday’s mistake.”
His weekend had been compromised in qualifying, the only major error he has made all season, which he acknowledged but from which he had given his all to recover.
“There is no room for mistakes when you want to be the best,” he said. “But it happens and that is a part of the growing process. Yesterday is behind me, today is a positive, to get back to fourth I am very grateful and very happy with that. I gave it everything, I had nothing left in my heart or in the car.”
He had come back from 17th to third here in 2009 and although he could not quite match it, with the championship decided he could make the most of his charge and did so with verve.
Ferrari will also take heart in finally returning to the top step. They have not won since the 11th round in Hungary – when Vettel led the championship. Converting his second place on the grid into victory, albeit without competition at the front from Hamilton, for their fifth win of the season is a positive the Scuderia will embrace.
Jock Clear, the Ferrari performance engineer was pleased they had made their mark in Brazil. “The pace has always been there,” he said. “It is a good fillip for going into the winter and then coming back even stronger.”
They had not been able to quite reach the Mercedes in qualifying but had been hopeful that race pace would allow them to match Bottas who had started from pole and it proved to be the case. The car has previously proved how well balanced it is and its strength through the corners and at Interlagos they proved to have developed it strongly to the end.
The German controlled the race with great skill, finishing with a rightful victory but is perhaps still left wondering what might have been but for that disastrous sequence of three races earlier in the season.
He enjoyed a superb start and jumped Bottas on the short run into turn one and, with the pace of the leaders very much matched, was able to run a flawless race to the flag, consistently just under two seconds clear of the Finn, while the Mercedes’ attempt at an undercut through the only stop was unsuccessful.
Hamilton scythed through the midfield and had made it to fifth on lap 20 and after his stop on lap 44 emerged just over 10 seconds behind Raikkonen in third. Putting in some very quick laps to catch the Finn, he was with him for the final circuits but with his tyres just losing grip did not have quite enough to take the place.
Vettel had thoroughly deserved the win but Hamilton hurling himself at Interlagos was also a clear reminder of just why he was able to take his fourth title this year. Both made a distinct impression on an otherwise dead rubber.
On an afternoon defined by Vettel’s confident victory and overtaking from the back, Ricciardo was also fully committed to the latter and after his spin he came back to claim sixth with an impressive display, behind Verstappen in fifth. Williams Felipe Massa bowed out in seventh place from his final Brazilian Grand Prix to a huge reception from the home crowd and Fernando Alonso converted his best grid position since he rejoined McLaren of sixth, into eighth place. Force India’s Sergio Pérez was in ninth and Renault’s Nico Hülkenberg in tenth.


Might Bite took his winning streak to four in the Future Stars Intermediate Chase at Sandown on Sunday and Nicky Henderson declared it would now be all systems go for the King George at Kempton Park on Boxing Day.
Henderson, who trains last season’s star novice staying chaser, said: “It was straightforward. His jumping was great. He just needed a run and I think he was running a bit fresh. He settled well and he jumped beautifully. That was ideal.
“Our objective now is the King George. He won’t run again until then and he’ll be miles straighter than he was today. That’s part one done. Our job is now to get him there on Boxing Day quite a lot fitter than he was today. I wouldn’t say a racecourse gallop would go amiss, actually.”
Might Bite is among the betting market leaders for the Cheltenham Gold Cup but Henderson said: “We’ll try and win the King George and then make a second-half-of-the-season plan.”
The eight-year-old asserted himself over the last couple of Sandown’s fences and justified his short odds of 4-9 favourite to score comfortably by eight lengths under Nico de Boinville, who said: “He was very fresh and well going down to the first. I felt I had to take it up when I did just because he was enjoying himself so much.
“He’ll come on bundles for that. The big fences played to his strengths. He was pretty straightforward and he’ll come on loads for that.”
Most bookmakers cut Might Bite’s King George odds to around 3-1 favourite, just ahead of Thistlecrack and Sizing John.
At Navan Apple’s Jade was the star act in a big-race hat-trick at the track for the combination of trainer Gordon Elliott, jockey Jack Kennedy and owners Gigginstown House Stud.
Apple’s Jade, a multiple Grade One-winning mare who won the mares’ hurdle at the Cheltenham Festival in March, made light of a 7lb penalty in the Lismullen Hurdle to suggest she is set for another lucrative campaign. Jer’s Girl looked a danger from three out but the class of Apple’s Jade kicked in from the last and the 8-15 favourite won cosily by two lengths.
“That was grand as she normally gets beat the first day,” Elliott said. “I’d imagine she’ll go to Fairyhouse now for the Hatton’s Grace. It’s grand to get that out of the way.”
Clarcam ran out a game winner of the other Grade Two contest on the card, the Fortria Chase. The seven-year-old dug deep to beat the long-time leader, Alisier D’Irlande, by half a length after being held up in the early stages. Mengli Khan looked a bright prospect when achieving the treble for Elliott.

The scoreboard may have only displayed 0-0 but Ange Postecoglou can take great satisfaction from how his Socceroos outplayed Honduras in hostile conditions on Saturday. The value of the result won’t become fully apparent until Wednesday but Australia must now be clear favourites to progress to Russia 2018 after experiencing only minor discomfort during a tactically-astute display in San Pedro Sula.
Indeed, considering the enormity of the circumstances, the abysmal playing surface, and the disrupted build-up, Australia’s performance was arguably its best of this marathon qualifying campaign.
Importantly, Australia matched Honduras for spirit in the early exchanges, refusing to be intimidated by the partisan crowd or some robust challenges. After ensuring there would be no alpha-beta relationship, Postecoglou’s strategy began to flourish.
Success began on the magnet board. Postecoglou’s team selection and organisation, especially in midfield, blended brains and brawn in appropriate quantities. There was a rudimentary element to it with three of the four central midfielders belonging to English Championship clubs (Mile Jedinak, Massimo Luongo and Jackson Irvine), and a fourth (Aaron Mooy) who has just advanced after excelling in that competition. These were the horses for just this kind of course, undaunted by intimidating away trips to combative opponents on cow paddocks.
There was nothing rudimentary about how the foursome played. Aligned in a midfield diamond, each was tasked with a specific role that when combined made Australia tough to break down and dominant in possession. Their unity of purpose in effect led to a six-man midfield overload with Aziz Behich and Josh Risdon’s heat maps revealing their participation much further up the field than orthodox fullbacks. It was a plan well-designed and well-executed, lacking only the goal the endeavour deserved.
“We’re just not getting our rewards and that’s the last thing missing from our game,” Postecoglou said afterwards. “Our general play’s great, we’re working hard, we’re just missing a clinical edge, but overall I couldn’t be happier.”
It is a refrain familiar to anyone who has hung around after the full-time whistle to listen to the coach offer his immediate reflections, and one that in previous matches has rung hollow. On Saturday it was hard to disagree; under duress Australia did almost everything right. A more cutting edge approach will be necessary on Wednesday, however, after the graft of an industrious opening leg.
Hull City’s Irvine typified this industry, operating at the most advanced point of the diamond, closest to Tomi Juric. He set the tone without the ball, disrupting the links between Honduras’ defence and midfield, crashing into challenges and establishing Australia’s physicality. It was not a glamourous role, and one unlikely to be repeated in Sydney when a more attack-minded alternative can be expected to start.
The returning Jedinak excelled in his familiar station, patrolling the space in front of his back three. He played with the assurance of a man in peak form, rather than one who has made only three substitute appearances for Aston Villa this season. The round-the-clock dedication of physio Les Gelis to guarantee Jedinak’s participation was time well spent.
The skipper’s certainty set the foundation for Mooy and Luongo to express themselves, and for Behich and Risdon to gambol outside them. It was the dynamism of that foursome that provided Australia’s advantage.
With Mooy operating mostly in an inside-left channel, the Socceroos were able to deftly unpick Honduras on the left, and switch play to exploit the space created on the opposite wing. That approach led to the best move of the match midway through the first half – when the dashing Behich benefitted from Mooy’s vision to create a half-chance that Irvine lashed over the bar.
This was not the surface for an artist like Mooy to display his full range of skills but his technique coped with the conditions better than most, keeping Australia moving forward and adjusting the tempo to suit the match situation. His set pieces left a lot to be desired, however, and Honduras’ ability in the air – considered a weakness before this match – will be tested further in Sydney.
The star of the show was the dynamic Luongo. Operating on the right of the diamond the QPR man was in perpetual motion, busy breaking down Honduran attacks, applying a relentless press and, crucially, taking the game on in possession. His drive with the ball at his feet gave Australia an edge they should have capitalised on. Luongo’s darting run early in the game deserved better than his tame shot straight at Donis Escober, and he was the architect for the second-half header Juric could not direct out of reach of the keeper.
Luongo has long proven himself in green and gold but remains on the periphery of a starting place in Postecoglou’s preferred midfield set-up, one shaped more like a square with Mooy alongside a holding midfielder at the base, and the scheming Rogic and pacey Kruse further forward; in effect a pair of sixes supplying a pair of 10s. By rotating the square 45 degrees the system suddenly demands not only one six and one 10, but a pair of energetic box-to-box eights, a position Luongo fills expertly.
The big question now is: how will Postecoglou apply what he learned in the Estadio Olímpico Metropolitano to the return leg? Will he persist with the diamond? How many pairs of fresh legs will enter the fray? As with home matches against Syria and Thailand in recent weeks, goals are a must in a fixture Australia simply has to win.


The Rugby League World Cup is in its 15th edition, with its first iteration in 1954. Yet, despite a history much longer than its cricket or rugby union counterparts, it struggles for widespread relevancy and respect. This is the case even in Australia – where the 2017 tournament is being held – and where the 13-man code is king in two of its biggest states and cities.
The NRL might be a multi-billion dollar business that attracts attention, huge sponsors and column inches across most of the country, but international rugby league is a different kettle of fish. Australia can be an insular, inward-looking place, and that is true of the way it has treated global rugby league’s showpiece event.
The 2013 World Cup, held in the UK, Ireland and France, is regarded as the most successful World Cup in history in terms of revenue, exposure and attendances. Then, the Kangaroos were triumphant, dominating New Zealand 34-2 in front of a record 74,468 fans at Old Trafford, but big crowds were also secured in diverse locations like Cardiff, Bristol, Warrington and London. A profit of close to £4m was generated, with the barrier set high for the 2017 version.
But before a Steeden had even been kicked, there were questions raised as to the controversial choice of venues and host broadcaster. Channel Seven won the World Cup broadcast rights, despite Channel Nine’s two-decade hold of covering rugby league in Australia. The old, reliable voices and faces of Ray Warren, Phil Gould and Peter Sterling were out, while no radio broadcaster partner was secured.
It is understood Seven’s more expensive bid helped it get it over the line instead of Nine’s trusted panel. Fan reaction to Seven’s coverage has been mixed, but TV ratings have been strong – the World Cup opener in Melbourne between England and Australia pulled in 1.4 million viewers, the highest-rating league game this year outside of the NRL grand final and state of origin.
Spectators have voted with their remotes but not necessarily with their feet. While attendances in the Papua New Guinean capital Port Moresby– where rugby league is followed with religious fervor – have been impressive (as in Auckland and Hamilton), the same cannot be said for other locales.
New South Wales was overlooked for World Cup matches, despite it being a rugby league stronghold. No matches have been staged in heartland areas such as Newcastle, Wollongong, Gosford and western Sydney. Instead, Melbourne’s AAMI Park, where less than 23,000 fans saw the Kangaroos defeat England, and stadia in Canberra, Perth and Darwin were chosen. Sydney is hosting just two matches, with only 10,237 watching England beat Lebanon – a fact noted by the travelling English media – and 21,127 seeing Australia down the Cedars at the Sydney Football Stadium.
In this, World Cup organisers have chased coin over crowds. The NSW state government refused to bid for games, so matches where handed out to the Victorian, West Australian, Queensland and ACT governments instead. While revenue has been guaranteed, game atmosphere and attendance size has suffered.
The Canberra market has been flooded with three matches while Newcastle’s McDonald Jones Stadium, which had the fourth-highest average NRL attendance in 2017 despite hosting the wooden spooners, received nothing.
The north Queensland locales of Townsville and Cairns are hosting a staggering six of the total 28 World Cup matches being played, despite their low population base. The long distance between host cities has meant recreating a proper tournament feel and community, as in 2013, has been difficult. Spectators cannot travel to games every day if they want to. The lack of mid-week matches – with all contests consigned to Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays – has also contributed to this.
Low-key publicity and promotion, outside of the host broadcaster, has not helped either. Some sports fans do not even know the tournament is on. Media coverage has been focused on NRL transfer stories, the Melbourne Cup, the women’s and men’s Ashes series and the Socceroos bid to reach Russia; anything but the Rugby League World Cup. Even in News Corp papers in rugby-league loving Sydney, the tournament has been buried behind story after story on Cooper Cronk’s move to the Roosters, Mitchell Pearce’s departure and the future of Penrith’s Matt Moylan.
The World Cup’s most covered yarns have been around off-field, alcohol-related incidents involving the Italian and Scottish teams, and a biting allegation made against an English winger. Meanwhile, genuine feel-good stories, like Samoa and Tonga’s amazing pre-game face-off, and the admirable performances of Lebanon and Fiji, have received fewer headlines comparatively.
At the core of the issue is that Australia loves the NRL – not rugby league. International rugby league is an irritant to the NRL, a mosquito on the arm of the Australian game, not the core focus like it is other parts of the world. That dismissive attitude sadly flows from the NRL down.
“I get the impression from speaking to people involved in the game in the southern hemisphere that the World Cup is looked upon as a third tier comp,” said Wales coach John Kear. “They say top tier is state of origin, second tier NRL and this is seen as a standard below NRL. It probably is and that is reflected in the interest shown in it.”
That view means many genuine, engaging World Cup moments and contests have been missed and ignored. Perhaps the only thing that would wake up mainstream Australia to the tournament happening on its shores right now would be if the defending champions were knocked out prematurely. A shock Kangaroos exit might demonstrate that there is life outside of the NRL after all.


Manchester City seized top spot in the Women’s Super League, breezing past Bristol City 4-0 after Chelsea dropped points for the first time this season. A Magdalena Eriksson own goal gifted Reading a last-gasp equaliser in a 2-2 draw at Adams Park before the reigning champions recorded a convincing victory over the struggling Vixens, who have not registered a victory since September.
Chelsea flattered to deceive for much of the first half before Remi Allen put Reading ahead after 35 minutes, slotting home her second goal of the season from close range after latching onto Fara Williams’s exquisite backheel. It was the first goal Chelsea had conceded in almost 400 minutes of WSL 1 football. Chelsea had forced Mary Earps, the Reading goalkeeper into a couple of early saves from Drew Spence and Fran Kirby but it was from a second-half dead ball that they eventually prospered. Karen Carney earned a free-kick after her quick footwork eluded Rachel Furness on the edge of the box and the England international got back up onto her feet to wrap her right boot around the ball and send a rasping effort beyond Earps. Emma Hayes, the Chelsea manager, sought a personnel change 10 minutes later, with Eni Aluko replacing Spence.
Aluko soon made the desired impact, sweeping Kirby’s low cross past Earps for her fifth goal of the season. But with almost the last kick of the game, Hayes’s side surrendered their 100% league record when Jo Potter’s deep free-kick was headed beyond the Chelsea goalkeeper Hedwig Lindahl by her own defender, Eriksson, in the second minute of added time. “This is a long season with a lot more games to be played and teams will not pick up points against Reading this season as they are a top team,” Carney said. “I think it was a great game for the neutral – a great game to watch. It was end-to-end and more like a basketball game at times.”
After making light work of LSK Kvinner in the Champions League in midweek, Manchester City blew Bristol City away with another impressive display, with Izzy Christiansen, Claire Emslie and Abbie McManus finding the net before Jennifer Beattie completed the rout. The England international Christiansen opened the scoring from 12 yards, her second penalty in four days, her third goal in a week and her seventh of the season.
Arsenal also gained ground on second-placed Chelsea with a 3-0 over Sunderland as the Gunners welcomed in a new era under manager Joe Montemurro at Meadow Park. Arsenal named the 48-year-old former Melbourne City assistant coach as Pedro Martinez Losa’s successor on Tuesday and witnessed his team pick off the visitors with three second-half goals, courtesy of Louise Quinn, Vivianne Miedema and Danielle Carter. This victory moved Arsenal to within three points of Chelsea and five off the new league leaders.
Liverpool moved up to third in WSL 1 with a 1-0 win over Birmingham City that came courtesy of Niamh Charles’ second goal the season.
Charles scored in the Reds’ opening day Merseyside derby win but this goal might even have brought her more pleasure. Gemma Bonner’s long ball over the Blues back line set Charles in the clear but with Hannah Hampton rushing out the winger had to think quickly.
Charles settled on a cool lob over the keeper and was rewarded for her quick thinking when the ball sweetly nestled in the net. It was a goal of such simplicity that it makes you question why anyone bothers with shorter passing at all.
That was to be it for the scoring. Liverpool threatened to add to their lead but were largely playing on the break as City poured forward in search of an equaliser. The away side were not without their near-misses. Charlie Wellings went close in the first half when sent clear by Freda Ayisi but the attempted lob from 25 yards went inches wide.
In the second half Ayisi went even closer, crashing a close-range effort against the bar following some nice work in the buildup from Wellings and Rachel Williams. That was as good as it got for the Blues who could not prevent Liverpool leapfrogging Arsenal and Reading before Sunday’s round of fixtures.
Earlier in the day, Everton secured their first three points since this season’s return to the top flight with a 2-0 win at Yeovil.
On Friday Yeovil announced their intentions to go professional next season in order to stay in the restructured Women’s Super League but for Toffees captain Danielle Taylor her focus was only on going to Huish Park “get our first win in the league”.
The travelling side did not have to wait long to assume the ascendancy. After just 17 minutes Courtney Sweetman-Kirk raced on to Faye Bryson’s through ball and lifted a lovely finish past Glovers keeper Megan Walsh.
Sadly for Everton, Sweetman-Kirk was not as sharp when presented with a chance to get a second six minutes later. This time Walsh did enough to put off the striker, whose effort drifted wide. Andy Spence’s side then survived a scare on the half hour, as an unmarked Ella Pusey inexplicably headed Ellie Curson’s cross wide.
Given Yeovil were yet to score in their four previous WSL 1 fixtures, a second would surely be enough for Everton to earn victory and Chloe Kelly got the golden opportunity when Nicola Cousins felled Sweetman-Kirk in the box. Kelly held her nerve and her teammates kept their composure to see out the victory.
Post-match, Kelly said Everton’s win showed they deserved to be back in the top flight: “We’ve been having good performances but not the points on the board. I think in this game we got the early goal and proved that we deserve to be in this league. I think we showed that on the pitch.”


Ireland remain outsiders to be awarded the 2023 World Cup when the 31 members of the World Rugby Council meet on Wednesday, but on the basis of their 38-3 pummelling of South Africa their future on the pitch looks in rude health, regardless of what happens in the secret ballot.
The manner of the record victory against the Springboks on Saturday was impressive enough, but it was the fact so many inexperienced players left their mark that really had the Ireland head coach, Joe Schmidt, purring.
The starting XV contained only eight of the side that defeated England at the end of the Six Nations Championship this year, with the back line particularly youthful. Yet Jacob Stockdale, who was making his first Ireland appearance at home, scored a try, as did Andrew Conway, who was earning his fourth cap, on the other wing. Meanwhile, the debutant centre Bundee Aki also made his mark, taking out the giant Springbok prop Coenie Oosthuizen, who was carted off in the second minute, and then looking lively with the ball.
As the 21-year-old Stockdale admitted, the victory has whet his appetite for more international rugby. “I wish there was a game tomorrow,” he said, smiling. “Well, my body doesn’t, but my head does.”
It has been quite some rise for Stockdale, given he only made his Ulster debut in January 2016, but he has a wise head on young shoulders. Afterwards he admitted he still had much to learn and said the result was largely down to Schmidt and Ireland’s defence coach, Andy Farrell.
“There was a big focus in training this week with Andy on how the wingers, in particular, had to be really nailed on in our defence, and I think that we really did that,” he said. “We knew they were going to come with big ball carriers and that we had to get in their face and be physical. The only way to combat physicality is to be physical yourself and I felt we did that really well and that relentless pressure really paid off.”
Stockdale was particularly proud of emptying Dillyn Leyds in a tackle, forcing a turnover and earning a loud cheer from the crowd. “It’s something I’ve really tried to focus on,” he admitted. “It’s something that Andy has really helped me with; trying not just to survive in defence but to dominate. I feel I’m starting to do that.”
As the Ireland second row Devin Toner explained, the hours of work that Schmidt has put in on the training ground meant the new players settled in quickly – and effectively. “You hear it time and time from us – it’s all about preparation,” he said. “Everyone from one to 23, and even the lads who weren’t in the squad from 24, 25 and 26 who were training with us were ready at the drop of the hat.
“It’s become a mantra ever since Joe came in. When the new guys came in they knew straight away that they need to know their stuff, and they did.”
Toner also paid tribute to Iain Henderson, who had one of his best games for his country, calling him a special player. “He gives confidence to the guys around him,” he said. “You know he’s going to get over the gainline. You know he’s going to smash them in the tackle.”
That much was evident when he ran over the South Africa captain Eben Etzebeth in the first half. “When he was coming through we didn’t call him man-child for nothing,” Toner said. “He’s a monster in the gym and he’s a monster on the pitch. It’s great to see him become the player he had the potential to be.”
Toner also said he hoped that World Rugby would “vote with their heads” and choose Ireland to host the 2023 World Cup despite a technical report that favoured South Africa and France over them.
And Irish rugby was given some hope as the former Australian Rugby Union head John O’Neill gave his backing to their bid – and claimed that Australia’s two votes might yet prove decisive. “There will be hundreds of thousands of visitors going to whichever country it’s located in, so it has to be an experience of a lifetime,” he said.
“If I was looking at it saying the quantitative between Country A and Country B is there or thereabouts, OK then, what is the best rugby experience? I would be voting for Ireland on that basis.”


The playing of the Star-Spangled Banner is so familiar and perfunctory a trapping of sporting events in the United States that few Americans even bothered to consider what it means and why it’s a tradition until last year when Colin Kaepernick chose to take a knee in protest of police violence and racial inequality. The stakes were redoubled this September when Donald Trump called on NFL owners to fire any players who kneel, recasting Kaepernick’s movement as not a protest of social injustice but an affront on patriotism and an insult to the military soldiers who paid the ultimate price for freedom.
But how did a song about the War of 1812 that wasn’t even adopted as the national anthem until the 1930s become so indelibly bound to the American sporting experience? It didn’t happen overnight.
While the first documented performance of the Star-Spangled Banner at a sporting event was before an 1862 baseball game in Brooklyn, the anthem as game-day ritual became crystallized in the national consciousness during Game 1 of the 1918 World Series between the Red Sox and Cubs at Chicago’s Comiskey Park. These were the days before stadium sound systems that blast pop music at ear-splitting volumes during even the thinnest slivers of down time. Live music was a luxury that incurred the cost of hiring a military band, which left renditions of the anthem for special occasions like opening day or the World Series.
The United States had lost more than 100,000 soldiers in the 17 months since entering the first world war and morale had been further undercut by the bombing of the Chicago Federal Building only four days earlier, an attack that killed four people and injured 30 more. Attendance for the opener was low and public morale was lower, while a pitchers’ duel – ultimately won by Boston pitcher Babe Ruth! – did little to stoke passions in the stands.
That was until the military band on hand played the Star-Spangled Banner during the seventh-inning stretch and Red Sox third baseman Fred Thomas, playing the Fall Classic while on furlough from the US Navy, stood at attention toward the flag atop the pole in right field.
“The yawn was checked and heads were bared as the ball players turned quickly about and faced the music,” read the New York Times’ account the following day. “First the song was taken up by a few, then others joined, and when the final notes came, a great volume of melody rolled across the field. It was at the very end that the onlookers exploded into thunderous applause and rent the air with a cheer that marked the highest point of the day’s enthusiasm.”
The song wouldn’t be officially adopted as the national anthem until a congressional resolution in 1931, but the impact of the moment was not lost on baseball’s power brokers, who had stood by as the government began drafting major league ballplayers for military service while shortening the season by a month.
“Professional sports needed to define themselves as patriotic in order to be seen as as part of the war on the home front and center for morale rather than as an expendable entertainment which is how they were initially,” says Mark Clague, an associate professor of musicology at the University of Michigan who is one of the nation’s foremost experts on The Star-Spangled Banner, lest we believe anything but the owners’ self-interest made the anthem into the ubiquitous tradition we know today.
Clague says the development and proliferation of stadium technology enabling the playing of pre-recorded music combined with a groundswell of patriotism during and after the second world war has given the anthem an almost continuous place in baseball in the years since. Football was similarly keen to wrap itself in the flag with NFL commissioner Elmer Layden in 1945 calling for a league-wide adoption of the anthem, saying: “The national anthem should be as much a part of every game as the kick-off. We must not drop it simply because the war is over. We should never forget what it stands for.”
Says Clague: “When world war two happened, professional sports had really figured out that patriotism was good for their business and it protected them against this question of being defined as a non-essential occupation.”
Criticism over anthem etiquette is nearly as old as the tradition itself. In 1954, Arthur Ellers, the Baltimore Orioles’ general manager and a world war one veteran, bemoaned that spectators conversed and laughed and moved around while the anthem was played. Celebrities enlisted to perform the anthem from Roseanne to Christina Aguilera to R Kelly have absorbed withering criticism, while a long line of athletes prior Kaepernick have taken heat for falling short in their fealty, either intentionally or otherwise.
These days, the 203-year-old song has exposed a fault line between those who see the anthem and flag as ideals beyond reproach and others who believe patriotism is contingent on how a country treats its citizens. But the NFL’s place on the front lines of the debate is curious when you consider that players weren’t even required to stand on the field for the anthem, with the exception of the Super Bowl and extraordinary circumstances such as the aftermath of 9/11, until 2009. That the hurlyburly threatening the future of America’s most popular sports league centers on an eight-year-old tradition really is something.
The bombastic pre-game spectacles of patriotism that had become commonplace at NFL games began to make sense in 2015, after a report by Republican senators John McCain and Jeff Flake revealed the Department of Defense had spread $6.8m of taxpayer money among more than 50 professional teams across the NFL, NBA, MLB, MLS and Nascar. In return, the teams promised organized displays of national pride including the honoring of members of the armed forces, surprise military homecomings and on-field color guard and reenlistment ceremonies. The co-opting of America’s most popular institutions as recruiting tools went by an easy-to-remember name: paid patriotism.
“Americans deserve the ability to assume that tributes for our men and women in military uniform are genuine displays of national pride, which many are, rather than taxpayer-funded DOD marketing gimmicks,” the 145-page report said.
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, the NBA’s all-time leading scorer and a longtime champion of civil rights, was to the point in his defense of Kaepernick for the Washington Post. He wrote: “What should horrify Americans is not Kaepernick’s choice to remain seated during the national anthem, but that nearly 50 years after [Muhammad] Ali was banned from boxing for his stance and Tommie Smith and John Carlos’ raised fists caused public ostracization and numerous death threats, we still need to call attention to the same racial inequities. Failure to fix this problem is what’s really un-American here.”
Stick to sports? Good luck. It’s clear by now that the battle hymn at the center of national debate in the US will always be associated with the games we watch. If only our commitment to the issues put forth by Kaepernick and co was as resolute.


Marc Márquez won his fourth MotoGP world title in five years on Sunday after Andrea Dovizioso crashed during the season-concluding Valencia Grand Prix.
Márquez only needed to finish in 11th place or better to seal the title. Starting from pole, the Spaniard steered his Honda to a third-place finish behind the race winner Dani Pedrosa.
Dovizioso was the sole rider who could challenge Márquez. His only hope of tipping Márquez for the title was to win the race and see Márquez finish 12th or worse. Instead, the Italian wiped out with six laps remaining.
Moments before Dovizioso lost control of his Ducati, Márquez had a scare when he barely managed to keep his bike up and on course for the championship.
DRAMA!!! Marquez runs on at turn one after a MASSSSSSIVE save! 😱He rejoins in 5th! #FinalShowdown pic.twitter.com/nt4Lsy01UR
Márquez shared the victory with his fans at the Circuit Ricardo Tormo where he cemented his reputation as the biggest talent in motorbike racing. At 24, he has won four of the last five titles in the top category, to go with two titles he had previously won in the lower classes.
Pedrosa, another Honda rider, overtook Johann Zarco late in the race.
In Moto2, Miguel Oliviera won ahead of the champion Franco Morbidelli. In Moto3, the pole-sitter Jorge Martin won the race ahead of champion Joan Mir. It was Martin’s first race victory.


This month Hong Kong won the bid to host the 2022 Gay Games – the first time the Games will be held in Asia.
The campaign to win the Games, though, was organised by a dedicated team of volunteers rather than the territory’s government, and Hong Kong’s chief executive, Carrie Lam, offered only a lukewarm response, stating that she “noted” the news. She then cited her Catholic faith and stressed that she does not condone same-sex marriage.
Last year guidelines in China banned TV content 'exaggerating the dark side of society' – which includes homosexuality
In fact Hong Kong, despite decriminalising same-sex sexual acts in 1991, has no comprehensive legislation to protect LGBTI people from discrimination. The government often uses the excuse that the topic is “controversial” and that “majority consensus” has not yet been reached. However, a study I undertook that was commissioned by Hong Kong’s equal opportunities commission shows that 56% of those surveyed supported such legislation, including a staggering 92% of those aged between 18-24. It seems that the government refuses to acknowledge the obvious changes in social attitudes.
And in mainland China too, the government’s stance on homosexuality is not as progressive as that of other institutions. Though homosexuality was never explicitly criminalised, gay men were persecuted under the law against hooliganism until it was abolished in 1997. Homosexuality was listed as a mental illness until 2001. In the past few years, there have been a number of strategic legal cases on LGBTI rights in China, including a gay man suing a private gay conversion therapy clinic, two gay men seeking to legally marry in Changsha, a student suing the ministry of education, and a transgender man who sued a company for wrongful dismissal. In July, a court in Henan province ordered a city hospital to pay a fine and to apologise to a 38-year-old man who had undergone forced gay conversion therapy.
Many of these lawsuits ended with results in favour of LGBTI rights, and activists and lawyers managed to generate important public debates and draw international media attention. These cases show that, as in other countries, when the government refuses to protect LGBTI people’s rights, the judiciary can be the last resort.
But while the judiciary has shown signs of supporting LGBTI rights, the government has not. China has traditionally adopted a “not encouraging, not discouraging and not promoting” policy on homosexuality. Worryingly, however, the government recently took steps to ban social discussions on LGBTI issues. Last year China’s media administrator issued guidelines on banning content on television that “exaggerates the dark side of society”, which includes homosexuality. In July, the China Netcasting Services Association published new guidelines banning the depiction of “abnormal sexual behaviour”, which includes homosexuality, in online video content. Such a step denies LGBTI people the chance to be fairly represented, in effect sponsoring homophobia in Chinese society.
However, the voices demanding LGBTI inclusion in society have been growing. Particularly, in Hong Kong – where businesses play a huge role in society – corporations have been active in speaking up for LGBTI equality. In March this year, a joint statement calling for legislation to protect LGBTI people from discrimination was supported by 75 organisations including Google and the American Chamber of Commerce.
The 2022 games will be a historic moment for LGBTI rights in Asia. The people of Hong Kong need the Games, which will hopefully prove to be a catalyst for their government to reconsider its archaic stance on LGBTI issues. How can the government on the one hand claim Hong Kong to be “Asia’s world city”, and on the other tell the 15,000 athletes and estimated 40,000 visitors to the Games that they are not welcome here?
If the government refuses to take any further steps towards equality, it would send a distressing message to the world: that Hong Kong does not celebrate difference and diversity. But I look forward to the Gay Games, in the hope and belief that by 2022 Hong Kong, and perhaps China too, may at last see significant progress on LGBTI rights.

Dick Rowe, the head of A&R at Decca Records in the 60s, was a kingmaker in the music industry. He signed the Rolling Stones in 1963, gave Van Morrison his break and launched the career of Tom Jones. But Rowe isn’t really known for any of these coups. He’s the idiot who rejected the Beatles. “We don’t like their sound,” it’s said that he told their manager, Brian Epstein. “And guitar music is on the way out.” Decca offered a contract to Brian Poole and the Tremeloes instead.
There are similar oversights in all creative industries. Sport is no exception: what, for example, if there was someone who managed to let the three best players in today’s Premier League slip through their fingers? A person who did the equivalent of rebuffing the Beatles, the Stones and the Kinks. That guy would be a world‑class buffoon, no? His name would be a punchline. Well, there is such a man. He’s called José Mourinho.
When Mourinho returned to Chelsea in June 2013, Kevin De Bruyne and Romelu Lukaku were already on the club’s books. In January 2014, they were joined by Mohamed Salah, apparently – like the signings of De Bruyne and Lukaku – on the instruction of Michael Emenalo, Chelsea’s technical director from 2011 until last Monday.
De Bruyne – the same De Bruyne who now gets compared, not ludicrously, to Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo – was assured by Mourinho that he was part of Chelsea’s plans and then, six months later, sold to Wolfsburg for £18m. This was a decent bit of business for the German club as, just 18 months later, his value had trebled, Manchester City paying £55m. It certainly bucks the current UK inflation rate of 2.9%.
Lukaku, rated in January 2014 by the Guardian as one of the 10 most promising young players in Europe, was sent on loan to Everton not long after Mourinho’s arrival. The deal was made permanent the following summer for a fee of £28m. This has also come to look like a steal: three years later, back in the summer, Lukaku moved again, to Manchester United for a fee rising to £90m. Again, this is more than three times what Chelsea received for him.
Salah, likewise, was never given a run of games by Mourinho, making just 13 league appearances before being packed off on loan. This would eventually lead to a £11m transfer to Roma in the summer of 2016. One year later Liverpool would pay up to £43.9m to bring the Egyptian back to England.
All of these three young footballers – De Bruyne is the oldest at 26 – have been unplayable at times this season. And you couldn’t exactly say it’s a shock they’ve turned into the players they’ve become. No wonder, then, that Mourinho received a cool reception when he returned with Manchester United to Stamford Bridge last Sunday. There was no repeat of March’s three‑fingered salute to Chelsea fans – the number of Premier League titles he won at the club during two stints – though he did very energetically acknowledge the United support when they sang his name.
He’s like the dipsy pater familias at a family gathering where everyone knows he’s frittered away the inheritance
But could you blame the Chelsea faithful for being annoyed with him? What a team they would have now if they had held on to De Bruyne, Lukaku and Salah. How much weaker their title rivals would be. It must be like the dipsy pater familias turning up to a family gathering where everyone knows he has frittered away their inheritance.
Of course, it’s a bit more complicated than that. Chelsea’s transfer strategy has, in recent times, been overseen by Emenalo, the director Marina Granovskaia and the chairman, Bruce Buck, to specifications and budgets set by the owner, Roman Abramovich. Both Mourinho and his successor Antonio Conte have been frustrated by it.
The counter to that, though, is that it was Mourinho’s choice alone not to pick De Bruyne, Lukaku or Salah. Abramovich hasn’t exerted leverage on team selection since the days of Andriy Shevchenko. And it was a lack of playing time that was the key factor in all three leaving.
So, how is Mourinho’s name not mud? How did he walk into the top job at the world’s richest and most popular club? Albeit that club being Manchester United, which itself made the most catastrophic financial bungle in football history: allowing Paul Pogba to leave for free in 2012, only to buy him back four years later for £93m.
Mourinho would point, as he always does, to his palmarès. In the 2014-15 season, Chelsea’s experienced squad lost only three matches and won the League Cup and the Premier League. Also, Mourinho is nothing if not a pragmatist. The average tenure of a manager in English football is around 1.3 years; Mourinho, famously, seems to work on a three-year cycle. He might have trusted De Bruyne, Lukaku and Salah, given them the 30-odd games a season that would have kept them happy and Chelsea could easily have won nothing. And there’s nothing worse, in Mourinho’s world view, than being “a specialist in failure”.
What does this matter, anyway? The players were not psychologically scarred by the experience, and neither was Mourinho; Chelsea returned to winning ways last season. Well, it’s relevant because England currently has perhaps the finest crop of young players in its history. In the past few months, the country became only the second nation (after Brazil in 2003) to win the Under-20 and Under-17 World Cups in the same year. How these players are brought through will be vital to the future success of the senior squad.
Most of these players come from the academies at a big Premier League club. What happens next to them will be instructive to watch. Chelsea, especially, have overseen the development of some of the most exciting young talents in English football right now: Tammy Abraham, 20, and Ruben Loftus-Cheek, 21, both current loanees from Stamford Bridge (at Swansea and Crystal Palace, respectively), were called up for England’s friendlies against Germany and Brazil. The versatile 22-year-old midfielder Nathaniel Chalobah was allowed to join Watford in July, around the same time Danny Drinkwater was coming in for £35m.
Surely Chelsea aren’t going to sit back and watch another talent drain? In the fast-return, results-now world of the Premier League, you couldn’t bet against it.


In 1955, when she was 12 years old, Billie Jean King says she had an epiphany. “I was daydreaming about my little tiny universe of tennis, and I thought to myself: ‘Everybody’s wearing white shoes, white socks, white clothes, playing with white balls, everybody who plays is white. Where is everybody else?’” she recalls. “That was the moment I decided to fight for equality and freedom and equal rights and opportunities for everyone. Everyone. Not just girls. Everyone.”
Now, 62 years later, the most sensational moment of her long, boundary-smashing tennis career has been turned into a film. Directed by Little Miss Sunshine’s Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris, Battle of the Sexes tells of the run-up to that infamous high-stakes 1973 match between King (Emma Stone) and the showboating, self-confessed “male chauvinist pig” Bobby Riggs (Steve Carell), in front of 30,000 live spectators and a colossal Superbowl-sized TV audience. But those expecting a straightforward sports movie may be surprised by its intimacy, as it draws a parallel between the weight of having to prove the worth of all female athletes in that one match, and the distress of hiding a secret affair with her female hairdresser from both her husband Larry and the world.
When meeting King, it is obvious why she has been at the vanguard of so much change, having dedicated much of her life to the fight for equality. When the men’s tour refused to address women’s concerns over pay disparity, King broke away to set up a women’s tour, with each of the “Original Nine” players signing a symbolic $1 contract (it is a barnstorming moment in the film, although the timeline has been loosened somewhat to fit dramatic demands). Shortly afterwards, she founded the Women’s Tennis Association. But when President Obama awarded her the Medal of Freedom in 2009, he praised “all the off-the-court stuff – what she did to broaden the reach of the game, to change how women athletes and women everywhere view themselves, and to give everyone, regardless of gender or sexual orientation – including my two daughters – a chance to compete both on the court and in life.”
In person, she is a brilliant and invigorating livewire, hands knitted together, leaning in to answer questions long before they are finished. She practically sparks with enthusiasm. She has a boundless curiousity about what other people believe, and before the hour is up she has discovered how old I am, where I grew up and what it was like. She is adopting the word “queer” because young people tell her they prefer it to “gay” (“although I still feel gay. You know why I like it? Because it’s happy, happy, happy”). She genuinely wants to know why: why did millennials not trust Hillary Clinton? Why did women, any women, vote for Donald Trump? She slaps her hands together gleefully when she hits on a point she wants to emphasise, which is usually a life lesson about how people can be more kind to one another. At times, chatting to her is like being in a one-on-one TED Talk. Her positivity is utterly contagious.
The story of the Battle of the Sexes match is familiar, thanks to its place in the history of sport and the many documentaries that have been made about it, but some of its more gruesomely misogynistic details are shocking for a modern audience, not least the complete refusal of the tennis establishment to take the idea of a professional women’s game seriously. King is pleased that parts of the film will alarm a younger generation, for whom she has a great deal of respect. “I’m really optimistic about millennials,” she beams. “And the Gen Z, I don’t know what you call them here – the ones that are 18, 19 now.”
In 2014, King founded the Billie Jean King Leadership Initiative, a non-profit organisation dedicated to promoting equality in the workplace. She says that, based on research it has carried out, “this is the greatest generation on inclusion ever. And that gives me hope. We’ve done all kinds of studies and it holds true that young people don’t want to be in a workplace that doesn’t have inclusion. They’ll leave work and go to another company if it has better inclusion.” She starts to rap on the table, delivering a speech. Diversity is absolutely vital to her worldview. “I think the kids that are younger are going to learn from millennials, and pick up on that, too, and I think this could probably save the world.”
She says this with such certainty that it feels mean-spirited to cast doubt on it, but I wonder if she still feels optimistic when the political establishment in the US and the UK feel so far away from that ethos. “But some of the people in the establishment believe in inclusion, so you have to look at each person.” King is big on trying to see the best in everyone, although she admits that, in one respect, during the 2016 presidential election, young people disappointed her – she feels they didn’t use the internet as a research tool. “These kids didn’t know one thing about Hillary. Not one thing. They only knew that Bernie was yelling ‘revolution!’ and ‘free education!’. I’m like: Really? What’s his policy to pay for the free education? ‘I don’t know.’ Well, you guys, it takes money. All these things that you want, they take money. You’ve got to be a little deeper in the weeds on this. Oh, my God,” she says, exasperated. “I would have given anything to have this technology at my fingertips. I would have loved it as a young person. But, use it! They didn’t use it for the elections, not at all.”
Last month, King gave an interview that touched on Trump and said: “I’m upset with the white women that voted for Mr Trump. I think they really don’t like themselves.” The quote was widely reported, but she seems mortified today, calling it “my biggest faux pas ever”.
“Oh, you know what? I got that all wrong. It sounds so sexist. It wasn’t about sexism – it was about gender. We were discussing the election and, of course, I got one little soundbite and I blew it on that. That was a big mistake I made. Of course I don’t know what each person thinks. It was a statement, but it was a question. How can any woman vote for Trump anyway, in my mind? I’m just asking myself questions.” She regrets the way she worded it then, but she is still asking the question now. “When you heard him say all those things on the bus about women and how you can grab ’em? How do you justify that? I just wanna ask.”
One of King’s many big theories about life is that, through sport, women can learn how to navigate a world built by men. “Men created the culture, not women, not really,” she says, matter-of-factly. “If you’re in sports, you learn [about] the old-boy network. You learn how they think. It gives you a leg up every time. The lessons you learn in sports, you can use in your daily life. I use it every single day of my life.”
During the early rounds of promotion for Battle of the Sexes, King sat down with Emma Stone and Andrea Riseborough – who plays her hairdresser and lover, Marilyn Barnett – for a three-way interview. Stone mentioned that women were making 80 cents to every dollar earned by men, and King gently interrupted: “White women. If you’re African American or Hispanic, it goes down, and then Asian American women make 90 cents to the dollar.” The internet applauded her intersectional feminism; Refinery29 compiled a video called “Woke Moments from Billie Jean King”. “Yes! That’s great. They understood that.”
It was a black player, Althea Gibson, who changed King’s view of what being a winner meant. “I think you have to see it to be it. Althea Gibson was the first woman of colour to ever win a major. In ’56, she won the French, ’57 and ’58, she won Wimbledon. I got to see her as a 13-year-old and she changed my world because I knew what it looked like to be No 1. She inspired me more than ever.”
Growing up in Long Beach, California, she was certain tennis would be her weapon. “It would give me a platform, if I was good enough. I’d have to be No 1 and I knew as a girl it wouldn’t be the same as a guy – it’s going to be harder, it’s going to be different. It is. We go unnoticed.”
King was a religious teenager, and her parents were homophobic. “I wasn’t comfortable in my own skin until I was 51,” she says. “It was a long haul. The movie was kind of the beginning stages of what I was going through.” The sense of pressure on screen is palpable. “Oh, so much pressure, to not be ‘like that’. And I love Larry. I married him thinking I was totally straight. He’s so gorgeous. He was gorgeous. We both were, I guess. Have you seen old photos of him?”
The conversation turns wonderfully gossipy. “You wouldn’t recognise him or me now. I fell in love with him across a room. I still would, probably. I don’t know. I either like ’em really dark or really light. Ilana [King’s partner] is dark, my first boyfriend was really dark. Then Larry was blond. I’m either one extreme or the other. I don’t really understand it.” Did it take her by surprise, then, to realise that she was attracted to women? Did she have no idea? “I know a person who was with a guy and had two children, and [thought] she was totally straight. She was in her 40s, and now she’s with women. That happens a lot. Or, I think more of us are fluid and can be with either. And they’d say: ‘That’s bisexual.’ Well, I don’t know. I’m with Ilana – it’s going to be 38 years in October, so to me I’m a lesbian right now. If something happened to Ilana, I don’t know, I’m always open.
“I prefer looking at men’s bodies, though,” she confides. “I think women, it’s more of an emotional thing. It’s physical, but it’s different. Whereas men’s bodies, I love broad shoulders, I love that look. So, I don’t know. I’m not sure. I’m a little screwed up, but it’s all right. At least I’m open to everybody.” It’s her openness that makes King so persuasive; she is open to what everyone has to say, including her enemies. But then, you don’t get to be the best female tennis player in the world without learning how to read your opponents.
In 1967, when she was 23 and at No 1 in the rankings, King was profiled by the New York Times. Even then, she was rallying against the stuffiness of the tennis world. “Oh, totally. I’m always getting into trouble,” she says. The writer referred to her as “an ordinary, attractive young lady”, and she laughs at the description. “Take lots of photos in your 20s, save ’em, cos when you’re old and wrinkly you can look back on ’em and go: ‘Ah, I looked pretty good then.’” She catches herself. “But we’re talking about body image again! Do guys think like this? I think guys do, a little bit more than they let on.” She is pleased that, 50 years ago, she was complaining that the elitist “club atmosphere” was damaging to the sport and that it needed to be brought into public spaces such as parks, where everyone could feel welcome. She sounded remarkably contemporary. “That’s what you have to do, be ahead of your time. Be ahead!”
King is hoping that the love story at the heart of the film will help others in areas where she could not be ahead of her time; as she says, she spent a number of years denying her sexuality. “I hope [it] helps motivate kids, young people, to fight for equality and freedom, and for the LGBTQ+ community …” She speaks the letters carefully, and then happily veers off track. “I say ‘plus’ because there are so many letters now, I can’t keep up. We have this Q now, it’s ‘questioning’ or ‘queer’. In my day, that would be the worst thing you could say. But I asked the younger ones, what do you like, and they like ‘queer’ now. So I’m starting to use ‘queer’, because they’re our future leaders.”
The film is a stark reminder of how much King was up against then, and how much women are still having to fight for recognition now, whether it is John McEnroe’s comments that Serena Williams would be “ranked, like, 700 in the world” in the men’s game, or Novak Djokovic stumbling over “the hormones and different stuff”. King would like it to be of use to others. “Maybe it will help them come out, but only come out when you’re ready,” she insists. “Do not out people.” In 1981, Marilyn Barnett sued King for what the tabloids salaciously called “galimony”, and outed her in the process. King lost her endorsements; the backlash was so strong as to be barely conceivable today. “Young people today are probably like: ‘Are you kidding?’ But even gay kids, or queer kids, didn’t talk about our situation among ourselves. It was totally shame-based.”
Her Australian contemporary, Margaret Court, has also been openly hostile. A minor character in Battle of the Sexes, she is now a pentecostal pastor in Perth who has said that “tennis is full of lesbians” and that gay people are “after our young ones”. King smiles, although the two were once friends. “[Margaret] believes in conversion, that if you’re gay you can turn around. Not happening, nice try. No. We’re all God’s children – accept us the way we are, as long as we’re not hurting others. When she said that trans children are from the devil – you don’t do that. Don’t hurt my community like that. I think we need to have a hard talk, and ask hard questions.”
Hard talk and hard questions seem to be what King thrives on. Still, she isn’t sure quite why she has spent much of her life trying to change the world. “I don’t know. I’ve always been this way, since I was a kid. It’s just, do you want to build goodness and a better world, or do you want to tear it down? You decide.”


If this was an open audition for some of England’s fringe players to make an impression on Wayne Bennett before the World Cup quarter-final with Papua New Guinea next week, then the England coach was certainly given some food for thought as his side beat France 36-6.
It is clear there is some way to go until England produce the complete 80-minute display that Bennett wants. But the number of changes he made in the second half here, with victory assured, will have surely played a part in the drop-off in performance. Much like last week against Lebanon, a first half of promise was followed by an error-strewn display after half-time which, with a sudden-death game against the unbeaten Papua New Guinea in Melbourne days away, will leave the England coach scratching his head once again.
However, he will surely have seen enough in the first 40 minutes to believe he has the makings of a side that next weekend can reach the semi-finals, though which and how many of his rotated side he trusts remains to be seen.
There were positives, though, on an ultimately comfortable night in terms of the result – the main one being the influence and performance of the St Helens hooker, James Roby, once again. Roby, handed a first start at this World Cup with Josh Hodgson left out, did more than enough to press his claim for a starting place against PNG, though Bennett may still prefer the NRL experience that Hodgson provides.
Furthermore the England coach has an interesting quandary on his hands in regards to his half-back selection. Kevin Brown said this week that he was fully aware his first World Cup appearance, at the age of 33, could be his last but his first-half performance will, like Roby’s, have possibly persuaded Bennett of another start next weekend.
When England were at their crisp, incisive best through the opening 40 minutes, Brown was impressive - and his experience in the halves helped bring the best out of not only Luke Gale at scrum-half but also Gareth Widdop, who excelled at full-back rather than his usual position of stand-off. There are players, such as St Helens’ Jonny Lomax, who could return to the side next week, but this spine, certainly for some stages at least, produced England’s best attacking moments of the tournament.
Facing a French side who, realistically, needed a minor miracle to reach the quarter-finals, England thoroughly outclassed Aurélien Cologni’s team and were out of sight by half-time. Like last week – when England were comfortably ahead at the break against Lebanon – there was an expectation that they would kick on. Again that did not materialise. That is undisputedly Bennett’s biggest frustration as things stand.The talent is there, the mind-set perhaps not so much.
It was Widdop who opened the scoring after three minutes, when a superb pass from Brown sent the St George Illawarra pivot through in what was a sign of things to come. England were superb early on, with Stefan Ratchford scoring their second try before another free-flowing move – again involving Brown and Widdop – put James Graham over.
By the time France registered their only try of the night through Ben Garcia, two more England tries via Mark Percival and John Bateman had ensured that Bennett’s side would, as many expected, confirm second place in Group A with relative ease.
Bennett would use the second half for experimental purposes, with a number of players playing in unfamiliar positions – and that clearly stunted England’s flow, with a litany of errors limiting them to only two further tries after half-time. They both came from the Huddersfield wing, Jermaine McGillvary, who now has an impressive return of 10 tries in nine games for his country.
Defensively England were again resolute and the fact they did not concede throughout the second half is perhaps the real positive of the second half for Bennett as he looks to the knockouts stages. The group stage has progressed as many expected. Selection decisions as the business end of the tournament gets under way will now be fascinating.


Those who belittle the value of an order of merit chase may need to look away now. The Race to Dubai has never seemed more appropriately named, given the appealing pursuit likely to occur in the Middle East from Thursday. That two Englishmen are at the forefront of proceedings both adds allure and to the sense that the nation’s golfers – plus their recurring success – are not appropriately recognised at home.
If Tommy Fleetwood had any doubts regarding whether to play in this weekend’s Nedbank Challenge in South Africa, they were forcibly removed by the actions of Justin Rose. Back-to-back successes in China and Turkey moved Rose to within €200,000 of Fleetwood in the order of merit. Sergio García, who sits third, remains part of the equation but the Masters champion would need snookers in the final event of the season, the DP World Tour Championship on Dubai’s Earth Course.
García’s glory offers a reminder of what Rose has had to recover from. The Spaniard’s maiden major success was widely heralded but Rose, whom he defeated in the Masters play-off, was visibly bruised. Rather than sulk, the 2007 Race to Dubai champion embarked on a late-season surge which has featured a second World Golf Championship win and a rise to sixth in the global rankings.
Rose has an element of unfinished business in Dubai. The DP World Tour Championship itself has eluded him, painfully so in 2012 when a final round of 62 was not sufficient to see off an inspired Rory McIlroy. “I love Dubai,” Rose acknowledges. “I feel like it’s a tournament I really want to win. I feel like it’s a tournament I have played well in. I feel like it’s a tournament I have won, actually, because I remember playing the last hole with a two-shot lead and making a birdie; that was the day I shot 62 playing the last hole and made that birdie. Rory was a few holes behind but very rarely are you two ahead playing the last, make birdie and lose. Rory birdied the last five to beat me that year. So yes, Dubai is a tournament that I really want. It’s a bucket list event. It’s one of the ones you want to win.”
Rose is well aware how swiftly his fortunes have turned around. “It would be a B-minus year probably a couple of weeks ago,” he adds. “Good solid year, top 10 in the FedEx Cup, it was good. But no win, you can’t really give yourself much more than a B-minus for that.
“Now I’m probably at an A-minus, with one putt at Augusta away from being an A-plus. I’ve been very consistent this year. I’ve played a lot of good, solid golf and it just hasn’t converted into wins. Now I’ve checked that box and now it begins to be a pretty good year.”
Fleetwood’s eye-catching displays came much earlier, showing how a season-long narrative can play out. The Southport man has played considerably more events than Rose in amassing his winnings of more than €4m. Fleetwood won in Dubai in January, was runner-up in March’s World Golf Championship and lifted another trophy at the French Open in July. Relatively speaking, things have tailed off since then but Fleetwood had the birth of his first child as an off-course mitigating factor.
“Hats off to Rosey for the way he’s played over the last couple of weeks,” Fleetwood says. “Justin is peaking. I had quite a bit of time off sort of late summer because I had other priorities at the time.
“But now I feel fresh. If anything’s not right at the moment [with my game] I feel fresh enough that I can put in a couple of extra hours’ practice. Normally this time of the year, it’s been a long stretch and it’s been a long season and people are getting tired. For me, I feel great.”
García has regularly displayed an indifferent attitude towards the conclusion to the Race to Dubai, to the point where he has never appeared altogether bothered about winning it. This year, at least, he has the valid explanation of that Augusta triumph and all the associated subsequent time constraints.
“It [the order of merit] is a motivation but it’s not going to change my schedule,” said García recently. “I’m already playing six tournaments towards the end of the year and I’m not going to go crazy. If it’s not enough, I’ll congratulate whoever gets it.
“At the end of the day, I know what clicks for me and I don’t want to overdo something now towards the end of the year and then feel it throughout next year. I still have to think not only present but future and, you know, we have to control what helps us and hurts us.”


Not for the first time in recent weeks, Neymar felt suffocated and affronted. It is part and parcel of being a marked man, an unwanted by-product of his lavish gifts. And he reacted. Towards the end of last month, it had been in club colours for Paris Saint-Germain in le classique at Marseille and the result was a red card in the 87th minute. On this occasion, it was in the yellow of Brazil and, once again, there would be a sanction, if not as severe. The weird thing was that when Neymar chased a ball forward in the 55th minute of the friendly against Japan in Lille on Friday, his team were 3-0 up and the atmosphere at a half-empty Stade Pierre Mauroy was hardly the bear pit of the Vélodrome.
Coincidentally – or perhaps not – his adversary was the defender Hiroki Sakai, who plays for Marseille and had been on the Vélodrome pitch when Neymar felt the red mist come down. In that game, having been involved in niggle throughout, Neymar reacted to a trip by the winger Lucas Ocampos by squaring up to him. He would receive a second yellow card.
In Lille, he grappled and tussled with Sakai, who refused to let him wriggle clear and then Neymar aimed his dig. It was part-cuff, part-slap and it caught Sakai across the back of his head. It surely did not hurt that much but Sakai reached his hand up to feel where it had landed. He did so with a flourish.
There followed a video assistant referee interlude, of the type we may have to get used to. The on-field official, Benoît Bastien, retreated to study a monitor behind an advertising board on halfway and when he returned he made the outline of a television set before showing the yellow card to Neymar. The Brazilian could not believe it. How dare Bastien. Neymar smiled, as he did after his dismissal in Marseille, and he made it plain that this was not the sort of thing that ought to happen to football royalty.
Neymar’s cockiness is a part of his appeal and, in many ways, it underpins his tricks and body swerves and all of the rest. But the world’s most expensive player has shown signs of late that he is in danger of crossing the line into petulance and entitlement.
Against Japan, which finished in a 3-1 Brazil win, he looked at Bastien whenever there was the slightest contact from an opponent and he fully expected to be given the free-kick. Sometimes, he was; sometimes, he wasn’t but it felt as though he was yet another assistant referee.
The countdown to the World Cup finals has started and every Brazil player can sense the scrutiny of his temperament. The mission has long been signposted: to avenge the 7-1 humiliation against Germany from the semi-finals of their World Cup in 2014. But with Neymar, who lives his life under the most brilliant of glares, it is more pronounced.
Tite, the Brazil manager, knows that he can ill-afford a lapse of discipline from Neymar in Russia and when he discussed the pressures on him it was revealing that he offered both sympathy and a reminder of his responsibilities.
“Neymar has made some mistakes with his reactions and he knows that this is wrong,” said Tite, who is now preparing for the friendly against England at Wembley on Tuesday. “I will talk about the last red card he got [for PSG]. He took a tackle and another one seconds later. Everyone is trying to stop him with fouls but he cannot react to this. I have talked with him about this. I tell him: ‘Just go to the halfway line.’
“The referee was right when he gave Neymar the yellow card against Japan. But the use of video technology will be a good thing because it will make for a fairer game.
“When we talk about players like Neymar, Willian, Philippe Coutinho and Gabriel Jesus, they are really fast and this is how defenders stop them. Against Japan, there was a sequence of fouls on Gabriel but I told him: ‘Go to halfway. Just play.’ This is the thing.”
If Brazil play like they have done under Tite, it will be easy to fancy them at the finals. When the former Corinthians manager succeeded Dunga in June 2016, the team had taken nine points from their first six World Cup qualifiers. They lagged sixth in the South American standings and, this being Brazil, there was hysteria that they might not qualify.
Tite has steadied the ship and more. Under him, the team took 32 points from an available 36 to qualify in style, well ahead of the chasing pack. This being Brazil, the pendulum has now swung dramatically. There is conviction among the supporters that their destiny is to win the World Cup.
“We are not the favourites,” Willian said with a smile. “We’ll leave that part to you guys in the media. But we are ready. Of course, we are ready. I think we are in a good way.”
One of the symbols of the Tite-inspired upturn has been Paulinho, who played under him at Corinthians when the club won the Copa Libertadores and the World Club Cup in 2012. Paulinho moved to Tottenham Hotspur in 2013, where he failed to make his mark, and he was playing at Guangzhou Evergrande in China when Tite got the Brazil job and surprisingly recalled him.
How Paulinho has responded. The midfielder scored six goals during qualification, including a hat-trick in the 4-1 win against Uruguay in Montevideo, and last summer he earned a transfer to Barcelona.
Tite has reshaped the squad and he has promoted trust and collective responsibility, most overtly with his policy of rotating the captaincy from game to game. Willian wore the armband against Japan for the first time in his international career and Tite has suggested that he could continue with the approach in Russia, however unusual it would be. “Everyone has to be a leader, not only one player,” Willian said. “Everyone has a responsibility to go on to the pitch to play, shout and do everything.”
It is Neymar who bears the greatest burden and he has been stung by claims that his relationships with the PSG manager, Unai Emery, and his club-mate Edinson Cavani have broken down. Tite insisted that the stories were untrue but the overriding call to his players was for focus.
It is a different Brazil squad to 2014 and of the 25 players that Tite will bring to Wembley only seven were involved at the last World Cup. Willian was one of them and he lived the nightmare of the 7-1. The scar will never disappear but he believes that the healing process is underway.
“The last World Cup ended strangely but, day by day, you can turn this situation,” Willian said. “We’ve done that. Now, it’s another story and Brazil have the confidence to go to the World Cup and win.”


Dig in was the instruction and dig in England did. It mattered little that Heather Knight’s side tallied just 166 runs at a glacial run rate of 1.89 on the final day of the Women’s Ashes Test. What they had achieved by losing just two wickets in their second innings was save the game, split the available points and keep their dreams alive of regaining the trophy.
After forgoing any chance of victory on a disastrous third day, it was the best they could have hoped for. The degree of difficulty remains high in the shortest form, needing to sweep the three T20s beginning on Friday, but had they capitulated again on Sunday it was all over.
Fuelled by that pressure, and led skillfully by their skipper Knight with an unbeaten 79 across 220 meditative balls, the visitors executed their plan perfectly by sucking the oxygen out of the contest. She found impeccable support from Georgia Elwiss, who was equally effective with 41 not out from 190 balls.
Those balls-faced counts became just as important as the runs they accumulated as England went about batting Australia out of the game – just as Ellyse Perry had done to them 24 hours earlier. They were aided by a compliant pitch, which never looked like breaking up or providing any meaningful assistance to the local bowlers.
Knight was approached by her opposing number Rachael Haynes with an hour remaining, electing to shake hands on a draw. The Australian captain acknowledged after play that she knew their chances were shot after a wicketless middle session where they weren’t able to break the resistance of Knight and Elwiss.
The highlight of the day was when Tammy Beaumont became the first wicket to fall just inside the first hour when England still trailed by 97. It came from 20-year-old debutant Amanda Wellington, who bowled the opener with a leg break to die for. Sure enough, comparisons to Shane Warne came thick and fast. On the available evidence, they aren’t without merit.
The only other wicket to fall was 11 overs later when another debutant, all-rounder Tahlia McGrath, slipped a straight yorker onto Lauren Winfield’s boot when England were 79 in arrears. But any momentum was sapped either side of the tea break as the pink ball became increasingly mangled by the surface.
That only 28 runs were added in the third hour, without the scent of a chance, highlighted that Knight and Elwiss were the perfect England batsmen for the job at hand. The latter was brought into the side to bolster the visitors’ batting after the ODIs, a selection that was validated by her patient approach. The Australians were spent, part-timers turned to in hope.
When the second new ball became available, openers Megan Schutt and Ellyse Perry were briefly able to get the ball bouncing and swinging, but by the time that interval arrived England were only 19 runs from taking the lead. They did so shortly thereafter, letting out a smile as Knight went on to reach her half-century in 162 deliveries.
After play, the Australian captain was critical of the wicket but proud of her bowlers for soldiering on. “It was a little bit frustrating,” Haynes said. “I felt a little bit for our bowling group. Later in a Test you expect a little bit of variable bounce at the very least.”
She gave generous credit to Knight and Elwiss, but said there was “nothing lost” for her side for failing wrap up the Test. “I certainly don’t sit here and feel empty or lost about where we are at,” she said. “Our team is in a very good position.” That they are, needing to win just one of the three T20s that begin this Friday at North Sydney.


Karl Oyston: found to have “illegitimately stripped” Blackpool of £26.77m. The ruling came 10 months after he called fans protesting about asset-stripping “a busted flush … I’m sure they’ll get bored in time. You can only go on so long trotting out the same tired rhetoric. They’re naive, child-like … I pity them.”
• Oyston’s other best efforts to change the narrative since 2014: calling a fan “a massive retard … special needs fuctard”; pledging to ban protestors “unless they sign acceptable behaviour orders”; and calling for more respect for his family’s “loyalty and commitment to the club … My father’s a manic Blackpool fan, and he suffers when the club’s not doing well. It really affects him.”
• Owen Oyston’s view in May last year on the family’s image: “People think we’re asset-stripping, taking money out – it’s absolutely ridiculous. It’s a pack of lies – it’s the kind of media attacks we’ve had. The media never let the truth interfere with a good story.” His message to fans: “Financially we’ve been a huge success.”
Yet to work out its line on the case – the EFL: still “reviewing the high court’s decision”. Among the EFL board members in charge of governance during the period when Blackpool were being stripped: Karl Oyston – elected for a third term in 2013, serving to 2015.
• Leading the praise for Oyston’s re-election in 2013 – then-EFL chairman, now FA chairman Greg Clarke: “It’s a pleasure to welcome Karl back to the board. Over the coming years his experience will be invaluable in shaping our organisation.”
Fifa – rewriting their 2026 World Cup bidding process to stop countries being exploited.

Lazio communications head Arturo Diaconale – identifying why the media “overplayed” coverage of their fans mocking the Holocaust last month. “This team, this club has grown in ways no one imagined – and that has provoked envy.”
• Also feeling resented: Nottingham Forest’s EFL-endorsed owner Evangelos Marinakis, standing down as head of Olympiakos to fight “baseless” Greek match-fixing charges. Marinakis says the charges were motivated by “envy ... My innocence will be proven.”
Brazil: Vasco president Eurico Miranda, 73 – re-elected on a traditional values ticket, including: “Football is a man thing. That’s why I’m against gays and women.” Miranda denied “sad claims” he rigged the vote with a “suspect ballot box”: “This was all done with the greatest transparency, including the adding up.”
• His other headline policy, set out in February: “I’m against gay referees. I’ve got nothing against gays, just fags, the flamboyant fags, all full of themselves. They’re going to be biased for the players they fancy.”

2) Colombia’s Edwin Cardona, responding to condemnation of his “slant eye gesture” at South Korea players. “I meant no disrespect to anyone, country or race. If anyone interpreted it that way, I’m sorry.” Coach José Pékerman: “It was a physical game. Things happen during a game like this.”

• Also making changes:Argentina, 7 Nov: Arsenal de Sarandi coach Humberto Grondona – son of late Fifa racketeer Julio – announcing his “irrevocable resignation”, then revoking it four hours later. “I regretted it, so I returned. Arsenal’s my home. I just get tired, you know?”
Belgium, 17 Oct: AS Eupen managing director Christoph Henkel, easing pressure on coach Jordi Condom. “It’s up to the players to question themselves, not always to complain about the coach. Condom stays.” 6 Nov: Condom goes.
Bolivia: Top-flight club Jorge Wilstermann sacking coach Roberto Mosquera after he picked five foreign players for a game by mistake, invalidating the result and leading to a points deduction. Mosquera: “It’s harsh. I made 141 changes for the Wilstermann. 140 of them were good.”
Romania: CSM Poli Iasi coach Flavius Stoican – banned for throwing his coat at a referee while his staff put on pre-prepared “We Want Fair Referees” T-shirts. Stoican said match officials were “feckless and timid, tiny puppies, small, small puppies. No personalities at all.”
Italy: Serie A Benevento president Oreste Vigorito, reflecting on 12 straight defeats: “This city has historically suffered from witches. That’s where the blame lies.” His message before next Sunday’s game against Sassuolo, where a loss would break Manchester United’s 1930-31 record for defeats at the start of a season: “One thing is certain: we’re staying in Serie A. We will never give up.”


After Michy Batshuayi scored two late goals to help Chelsea beat Watford in the Premier League, the striker took to Twitter. Using the quote tweet function he re-posted a remark by user @danndude10 and then embellished it. “I’ll eat my shit if Michy Batshuayi wins us this game,” the original tweet read. “Bon appetit,” replied the Belgian, who then added a flourish of two emojis in the shape of a poo.
In recent weeks, the striker is not alone in having responded to strangers online. When Manchester City’s Benjamin Mendy was injured in September the journalist Duncan Castles speculated as to the extent of the full-back’s injury. “Concern is that City’s sole specialist left back has ruptured an ACL,” Castles tweeted. “If so possible 9 months rehab process.” Four hours later, Mendy quoted Castles and replied: “Your bio says journalist so why you speak like graduated doctor? no one has test to see if ruptured ACL or not, even I don’t know lol.” Mendy was later informed the injury had been exactly as Castles – a former scientist who in fact has a PhD and so is a “graduated doctor” – had described.
Last week Liverpool’s Dejan Lovren experienced something worse than a medical diagnosis being broken to him by a reporter. The defender revealed he had received a death threat on Instagram. Following a poor performance against Tottenham Hotspur, a user had messaged Lovren, claiming he was “gonna murder ur family u Croatian prick”. The player responded by posting a video on the site: “I don’t mind when people talk shit about me, it says more about them!” he said. “But I cannot ignore when my family is threatened. I just can’t and won’t accept that.”
What effect does social media have on footballers? It’s not a question that is often asked. As users we are familiar with the images athletes project: of celebration after victory, positive thinking after defeat, of hard work and rehabilitation in the gym.
For international stars such as Cristiano Ronaldo or Paul Pogba we see their commercial activity, the posts in which they market their new boots or underpants. We also see players’ moments of infamy, such as the homophobic remarks made by Serge Aurier before he joined Tottenham and those of Andre Gray, now of Watford, which came to light in 2016 four years after he made them. But the flow of digital content doesn’t go only one way. As much as footballers are followed across the world, they are also talked about, their lives observed, analysed and dissected.
Adebayo Akinfenwa is a striker for Wycombe Wanderers but he is better known as “The Beast”. At 1.8m and 102kg Akinfenwa is, to put it mildly, a unit. He is also witty and voluble and Akinfenwa has used his talents to build a profile that extends beyond his goalscoring in the lower leagues. Social media have been central to that; Akinfenwa has 198,000 followers on Twitter and more than three quarters of a million on Instagram.
“I think when I first got on it there was nothing really behind it; you take out of it what you want,” he says. “I got on Instagram first, for pictures, for basics. But slowly and surely I realised it empowers you. As I’ve gone on using it I know the power it brings for yourself. And we now know everything is moving that way. How I see it, as a footballer we’re just smaller versions of a newspaper.
“There’s two aspects to how it works for footballers. I’ve got two players in my team, they want to snap and pose for a picture. For me I see it also being about people tuning into you online, so you create a schedule. The more you use it the more you become a TV guide. Monday training, Tuesday every other week a game. Wednesday off. The people that are following me as a brand, I need to be giving them visuals. It’s a massive thing in terms of what I want to do next. But ultimately it doesn’t define me, it’s not something that if I stopped my social life would stop.”
Even for Akinfenwa, however, his social media experience is not uniquely positive. “I get abuse every single day on all my media platforms,” he says. “Put a picture holding a trophy, someone will still find something bad to say. For me the block button, the delete button, they are beautiful things. I think: ‘You have purposely searched out my page and abused me. Once I’ve blocked you, I won’t know who you are.’”
Akinfenwa regularly gives presentations to younger professionals about how best to use social media and deal with the consequences. “One hundred per cent, the abuse affects players,” he says. “What I keep saying is that in this world you can’t make everyone like you. But I’m a 35-year-old who’s been in the game 18 years. If I post now and people abuse me because I’m fat or I’m playing in League Two, I know I’ve overcome people saying they wanted to shoot me because I was black at 18.”
Anybody who follows their club on social media, especially Twitter, will know it’s not just prominent footballers who receive abuse. Nor do they necessarily receive it directly. During and after every match, someone somewhere will be the subject of streams of invective. It happens in stadiums, too, but not in the same way and verbal abuse is not permanent, available to be read later or perhaps even searched for.
This year Ross Raisin published his novel A Natural, about a young footballer struggling with his sexual identity. Part of the story concerns a player who becomes obsessed with what people are saying about him on the internet. His fixation extends to the point where he starts writing under an alias, posting in defence of himself and criticising others. Raisin says he does not know of players who have gone quite that far but during his research he met many who could not stop reading what was said about them.
“It is very common and it was a real issue for a lot of the players I met,” he says. “Even one of the managers I spoke to confessed to doing it. It’s very difficult to resist. You’re looking at your phone and the world is out there; why are you not going to look out into the world?
“There is very little understanding of how it might affect players psychologically but they are as human as anyone else. They are not any more confident or less likely to be affected by what they might read about themselves. They just might have more armour.”
The nature of professional football, so often driven by outward confidence and machismo, means players are unlikely to admit to the adverse effects of criticism. Which means it will not be talked about. “Most of the people I spoke to had not received any support,” Raisin says. “This is a process of education that needs to go on for years. It needs to start at a young age. Most players have been in the system for years and are only used to that world. Things may be improving but I think that the emphasis is on working out any problems physically. The most important outcome is a good result on the pitch.”
Each professional club will take their own approach to supporting their players in issues regarding mental health and in recent years, thanks to campaigns such as Time to Change and the advocacy of former players such as Clarke Carlisle and Stan Collymore, the issue has received greater attention.
With regards to social media, however, it appears most information received by players is directed towards avoiding scandal. Literature provided by the Professional Footballers’ Association advises them to “avoid commenting on matters of a sensitive nature whether they be football related or not”, but makes no mention of how to engage with the comments of others on matters that might be equally sensitive.
Footballers are not alone in receiving abuse online and increasingly it appears to be a default characteristic of the medium. But football is a hugely popular sport and that popularity is increasingly driven by online activity. It’s not outlandish to suggest players might be exposed in a way few other people are.
With the opportunities for self-promotion provided by Instagram and Twitter, platforms will continue to provide a lure for many, especially while the consequences are not so easily understood. Perhaps players might do well to consider the words of Jürgen Klopp who, in the aftermath of the Lovren incident, offered these thoughts. “I cannot say don’t do it because, even for clubs, there are a lot of things we have to do on social media,” he said. “It’s part of the role. And it’s not bad, it’s just overestimated. You think it’s the truth.
“That’s our problem in this world, you read something and think: ‘Oh my God. That’s it.’ But in the real world if I read something about my neighbour I would go to his house and say: ‘Is it right or not?’ [On social media] we take it like it is – that’s what I don’t like about it.”


Can you help me as I am desperate. I am an international para-badminton wheelchair athlete for England who flew on British Airways to Finland in August to attend a training camp.
I was looking forward to training and learning to improve my career with other top players, and travelled with my specially designed sports wheelchair, and my manual one.
When we landed I discovered that my sports wheelchair had been trashed by the baggage handlers and was no longer usable. As a result the whole trip was wasted, as I could not take part in the training programme. Ever since, I have been trying to get the airline to compensate me for what happened.
I am due to attend the Para-Badminton World Championships in South Korea in November and am scared the same thing will happen.
I asked colleagues if they could loan me a chair but they are all bespoke. As a result I have had to borrow money from my sister and friends to purchase another chair at a cost of £5,095. BA is just ignoring me. Sharon Barnes, London
Given the huge rise in the number of wheelchair athletes that tour the world with their expensive chairs, one would hope that the airlines would have adapted their policies to find a way to stop this sort of thing happening.
We have received a noticeable increase in complaints about BA luggage problems in recent weeks, but that doesn’t excuse the airline from not responding.
Fortunately, we were able to push your complaint to the top of the list and the airline has apologised and agreed to pay the replacement £5,000+ cost.
“We have also spoken with both airports’ wheelchair service providers to seek assurances that our customers are receiving proper care and attention during their journeys,” it says.
You should be aware that this settlement is significantly higher than that set out in the Montreal Convention which limits the liability of airlines following a baggage claim to around £1,200. The EU has looked at whether the convention’s terms discriminate against those with disabilities.
In the meantime, you need to make sure that the replacement chair is insured. Allianz says it is a proud sponsor of ParalympicsGB, so maybe it could come up with a policy?

France were given a reminder of how far they still are from a maiden World Cup title when they were humbled 38-18 in Paris by New Zealand. The All Blacks scored five tries through Dane Coles, Waisake Naholo, who touched down twice, Ryan Crotty and Sam Cane, with fly-half Beauden Barrett adding the rest with his boot for the visitors’ 11th consecutive win against France.
Les Bleus, who suffered a string of injury withdrawals, responded with a try by Teddy Thomas, a penalty try and a couple of penalties by Anthony Belleau. France put on a solid display in the second half but they could not make up the deficit left by their dismal first-half performance. The New Zealand centres did a great job early on, putting the French defence under pressure.
It took the visitors eight minutes to score a try as the hooker Coles touched down after a five-metre scrum, with Barrett adding the extras. The hosts struggled to get past the halfway line and the All Blacks made it look easy with their second try through Naholo on the right wing.
France reduced the arrears when Thomas dived over at the end of a free-flowing move down their own right flank. But New Zealand were clearly a cut above and made the most of Rabah Slimani’s yellow card after the prop was sanctioned for repeated fouls.
Crotty scored the All Blacks’ third try after collecting a fine low kick from Sonny Bill Williams and Cane added another on the stroke of half-time. France hit back after the break, Belleau slotting home a penalty to cut the deficit. Williams was shown a yellow card early in the second half and France were awarded a penalty try as New Zealand lost their composure when the captain Kieran Read came off injured in the 47th minute.
Another Belleau penalty cut New Zealand’s lead to 13 points with half an hour to go. The Stade de France crowd roared as Thomas again dived over, but the Australian referee Angus Gardner ruled that the wing’s foot had touched the touchline before he put the ball down. New Zealand sealed a comprehensive win when Naholo scored his second try wide on the right for the All Blacks’ first points of the half, Barrett slotting home the conversion.


Granit Xhaka has told Northern Ireland to stop moaning about the controversial penalty that handed Switzerland the advantage in their World Cup play-off and insisted his country will confirm their superiority in Sunday’s second leg.
The Switzerland and Arsenal midfielder is clearly irritated his team’s strong first-leg display has been overshadowed by the spot-kick that decided the outcome. The referee Ovidiu Hategan awarded a penalty, scored by Ricardo Rodríguez, for deliberate handball by Corry Evans when Xherdan Shaqiri’s volley struck the now-suspended midfielder on the back. Xhaka claimed the controversy should not distract from his side’s dominance in Belfast but risked adding to Northern Ireland’s motivation for the return by insisting the penalty can be rendered insignificant by a commanding home display in Basel.
“I don’t know why it is such a big topic or why there is such a big discussion around it,” said Xhaka. “I think we should leave it. It was the decision of the referee and not of interest to us. We were the better team and we want to show that again tomorrow and qualify for Russia. We are a good team. We are maybe the better team compared to Northern Ireland and tomorrow, with all the support that we will have behind us, we want to make them proud and qualify for the World Cup.”
The Arsenal player’s thoughts were echoed by the coach Vladimir Petkovic, who argued the Romanian official was “good in general” despite adding to Northern Ireland’s grievance by failing to dismiss the Switzerland defender Fabian Schär for a poor challenge on Stuart Dallas, who is doubtful for the second leg with an ankle injury sustained in the fifth-minute foul. Blerim Dzemaili is sidelined for Switzerland, who have not lost a competitive home game since 2014, while Fabian Frei has left the squad due to a family bereavement.
Michael O’Neill, the Northern Ireland manager, believes the manner of Thursday’s defeat will serve as motivation for the second leg but will not divert their focus. He said: “It is not an insurmountable task, but a difficult one. I know the players will give their all. In terms of the magnitude of the game this is what international football is all about. It is why I want to manage at this level and why the players play at this level. We have to make sure we’re better for the experience of being here. Our focus is on a good performance, we’ll live with the result after that.
“We have to be better in possession than we were in Belfast. We have to put more pressure on Switzerland than we did. We didn’t press the ball as well as we could have done. The players watched the game again last night and agreed they can play better.”
The German referee Felix Brych, who took charge of last season’s Champions League final, will officiate in Basel. But O’Neill said a match official from one of Europe’s leading leagues, as opposed to Romania, was the least of his concerns with less than 72 hours to prepare his players for one of the most important games in their lives.
He said: “To be honest I don’t look too much at the referee because I have no choice in what happens. It’s of no concern to me. He is a very experienced referee and has great experience in games of this size. As a coach you’ve enough to worry about in the time you have to prepare. My focus is on getting the team right. I said to the players on Friday that what happened is gone. It’s not something we dwell on and our focus is on what lies ahead, not the officials.”

The UCLA basketball team is heading back to Los Angeles without three players arrested on shoplifting charges in China, a person with knowledge of the situation told the Associated Press on Saturday.
The person spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter.
Freshmen LiAngelo Ball, Jalen Hill and Cody Riley were to remain in Hangzhou, China, while the rest of the team was due back Saturday night. Ball is the brother of Los Angeles Lakers rookie Lonzo Ball.
UCLA didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment by the AP.
No21 UCLA won its season-opening game 63-60 over Georgia Tech in Shanghai earlier Saturday.
The trio was questioned by police about allegedly stealing from a Louis Vuitton store next to the team’s hotel in Hangzhou last week, where the Bruins visited before leaving for Shanghai.
Citing a source with firsthand knowledge of the investigation, ESPN reports the players could be Hangzhou for “a week or two” while the situation is resolved. The source told ESPN there is surveillance footage of the players shoplifting from three stores inside a high-end retail center.
Bruins coach Steve Alford declined to discuss the matter after the team’s victory. UCLA chancellor Gene Block, athletic director Dan Guerrero and Pac-12 Commissioner Larry Scott have been traveling with the team, but only Scott has issued any statements.
“It has provided a real distraction and unwanted publicity, which distracts from what overall has been a tremendous experience and a tremendous week for the UCLA and Georgia Tech students,” Scott said before the game. “We’ve had a chance to apologize for the unwelcome attention it has brought. There’s nothing new. We’re monitoring the situation and staying in close contact with the students, and we hope the situation resolves itself soon.”
The conference said Friday that California and Yale will meet in next year’s Pac-12 China game to open the 2018-19 season.


It wasn’t easy at first to understand the numbers that were potentially involved. It still isn’t, to be honest, when the latest police figures are so mind-boggling – on average, five new victims coming forward every two days – but particularly so at the start, when Andy Woodward was preparing to go public and telling me he was certain there would be many others, hundreds even, who had experienced the same kind of childhood horrors.
What has happened since started as a trickle but quickly turned into what the Football Association chairman, Greg Clarke, has described as a tidal wave. At the time, however, I can remember going to Andy, on the day before publication, to make absolutely sure he was happy to put the numbers so high. His response was that it might even be higher. The story went out. “Difficult knowing how to introduce this one,” I wrote on Twitter. “He’s a brave man and, as of today, he is free of his secret.” And then we waited.
The first six came forward inside five days. By the end of the week it was 11. And on and on. This week brings up a year since Andy became the first former footballer to speak about the sexual abuse he had suffered and the latest police figures, 748 victims, make it easy to understand why at least one force has advertised for retired detectives to help the process of taking statements.
To put it in some kind of context, more football coaches and people connected with the sport, 285, have now been accused of molesting boys than the number of priests and brothers from the Boston archdiocese, 249, who were identified as part of the scandal unearthed by the Boston Globe’s Spotlight team.
The victims come from all levels of football and, at the last count, 331 clubs had been “impacted”, meaning they had been named without necessarily being under investigation. Of the victims, 96% are male, the youngest being four years old, and the vast majority of cases happened in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s, though some as far back as 1950. Operation Hydrant has had 2,028 referrals and all but 27 relate to football – the others involving basketball, rugby, gymnastics, martial arts, tennis, wrestling, golf, sailing, athletics, cricket and swimming.
It is a lot to take in and, as if all that was not shocking enough, the real number of victims will actually be significantly higher when the figures have not been updated since 28 September and there are so many others who have suffered the same kind of ordeals but chosen not to report what happened.
Many do not think it is worthwhile now their abusers – paedophiles such as Frank Roper, a coach in Blackpool’s junior system, and Eddie Heath, formerly the chief scout at Chelsea – are dead. Others have now reached an age where they have their own children and have elderly parents and, understandably, want to protect their families. Many don’t feel they have the strength to deal with the tortuous, often torturous, process of going through the courts when it can feel sometimes as if there are glaciers that move quicker than the British judicial system.
After a year on this story, I have spoken to almost as many victims who have chosen not to go to the police as those who have. The numbers, again, are frightening and some of the stories that are waiting to be told leave huge questions about what the clubs knew, and what they did about it.
A lot of those stories will have to be held back for now because of the cases being sub judice but suffice to say there is startling evidence of cover-ups, and warnings being ignored, at a number of clubs.
The negligence also appears to be related to money in some cases. One recurring theme is that the people in charge were often reluctant to rock the boat if the person under suspicion was good at his job, potentially making those clubs money. Of everything we have heard over the last year, that perhaps is the most galling part when you stop to think about the number of children it put at risk. Some big football clubs and well-known individuals are going to find it a hard stain to wash out.
Aston Villa certainly need to explain what precisely happened after they were notified about the crimes of Ted Langford, a part-time scout for the club, during the late 1980s and maybe we will also hear from Dario Gradi at some point about his own judgment over the years. Gradi was suspended from all football activities by the FA last November after claims that in his coaching days at Chelsea he visited the house of a 15-year-old youth-team player to “smooth over” a complaint of sexual assault against Heath. Gradi has always denied any wrongdoing but the suspension remains in place, almost a year on, and it is clear the FA wants to distance itself from a man who was once revered for his work in junior football. Gradi was given a lifetime contribution award in 2014 and inducted into the FA Licensed Coaches’ Club Hall of Fame. His photograph has been taken down from the walls of St George’s Park and his name has been removed from the relevant wall display.
Hopefully we will get some more answers when the FA’s independent inquiry, led by Clive Sheldon QC, is published and perhaps, in time, there will also be an explanation from Gordon Taylor, chief executive of the Professional Footballers’ Association, about why his organisation did not do more after the 1997 Dispatches documentary Soccer’s Foul Play made it clear there was a serious problem inside the sport.
Everybody within the game, the media included, needs to look at how this scandal was ignored for so long. Yet the PFA, in particular, has much to answer for when, unlike the FA, it has had very little regime change at the highest level. Taylor has been there since 1981.
Sheldon’s report should be delivered at Easter and you might have seen the story recently about him seeing a counsellor, paid for by the FA, to look after his own mental health when he is being exposed to so many harrowing stories. Fair enough, but it is just a pity, perhaps, that the FA has not been so generous when it comes to the players whose lives have been shaped by the abuse. Many have been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder and still suffer from anxiety, depression, insomnia and panic attacks. They do at least have support groups such as the Offside Trust and SAVE but many have experienced what a hard-faced organisation the FA can be.
Equally, it might have been an idea if the FA had gone to any real effort to help the victims, or anyone else who might have vital information, to understand how to go about the process of speaking to the inquiry. That, after all, is surely the first starting point of any such investigation: to hear from as many people as possible. Yet if you were to click on the FA’s website – the place, you might imagine, where the process might be explained – there is nothing about it all.
Instead, the FA, acting independently of the barrister, has set up a convoluted and hard-to-locate system whereby the only way anyone can submit evidence is by clicking on the website for Sport Resolutions and going through a link named “Football Review”. Even then, it still doesn’t make it absolutely clear what it is. There isn’t even a helpline, just an email address for “written submissions” and no clues whatsoever why the FA should presume anyone would know this was how it worked.
It all feels so dreadfully typical of the FA and helps to explain why, by mid-October, Sheldon had interviewed no more than 15 victims. Clarke, who has described it as the biggest crisis in the history of the FA, claimed during his calamitous appearance before the House of Commons digital, culture, media and sport select committee recently that he had spent 22 hours a day working on the case when the story broke. Perhaps he needed a rest if this was the best he could come up with.

Congratulations to the Football League for a return to form when it comes to its contender for the most absurd story of the week, featuring a referee by the name of Ben Toner and, plainly, a mild panic in the corridors of power when the relevant people realised that he was officiating a Blackpool match.
If you are not aware of this story by now, it is fair to say Toner’s name had caused some mild humour on social media in the week after Blackpool’s majority owner, the Oystons, were found by a high court judge to have operated an “illegitimate stripping” of the club.
Yet it was hardly a big deal and, in terms of bringing it to everyone’s attention, it certainly hadn’t warranted the kind of publicity that attached itself to the league’s decision to remove Toner from Blackpool’s game against Portsmouth because of the “increased attention” surrounding the match.
You have to feel sorry for the referee in question and wonder whether this will be the last time he encounters this problem. Will the league actually have to monitor his games in case of any more outbreaks of passing humour at clubs with questionable owners? And thank goodness Twitter didn’t exist in the years when Segar Bastard, referee of the 1878 FA Cup final, was on the circuit.
Gareth Southgate has made it absolutely clear he does not believe any of his injured players have been winging it over the last week and, in fairness to the England manager, I would be willing to take him at his word.
After all, Southgate knows a thing or two about players who might – let’s put this delicately – not have been entirely committed to their profession, judging by one of the stories he tells about being a team-mate of Sasa Curcic at Aston Villa.
According to Southgate, Curcic once disappeared for a few days, mid-season, without the other players knowing why until he returned to training and explained he had been in hospital for a nose operation.
“But you didn’t break your nose,” someone said.
“No, it was something to improve the shape.”
That’s right: Curcic missed the following match because of plastic surgery on his nose. “I would love to have had improvements on my nose,” Southgate recalls. “I probably needed them more than Sasa, but in mid-season?”


David Moyes has moved to allay Javier Hernández’s possible fear of being excluded at West Ham as he was at Manchester United – though the Mexican’s first appearance for the Hammers under Moyes could be delayed by injury.
Hernández has played more first-team football this season than he did in the whole of Moyes’s one incomplete campaign as manager of Manchester United. In 2013-14 the striker started only six league games and two of 10 matches in the Champions League, complaining at the time that: “My club don’t take me much into account.”
At the World Cup at the end of that season he appeared only as a substitute, with Mexico’s then manager, Miguel Herrera, attributing the decision to the “difficult year” Hernández had endured. Now the striker, who suffered a suspected hamstring injury during Mexico’s 3-3 draw with Belgium on Friday, finds himself working under Moyes again in a World Cup year.
“He’s a top goalscorer, a brilliant finisher,” said Moyes of the 29-year-old. “It was difficult for him at United because I had Robin van Persie, Wayne Rooney, Danny Welbeck, Shinji Kagawa, so there was lots of competition. But he’ll be treated the same here – if he’s playing well and scoring, no problems. If he’s not, it will be the same as the rest.”
Moyes, speaking before Hernández’s injury, said that he would be relying on the striker and his other senior players to keep the team organised during matches. “They need to be there to say: ‘Yeah, we know what we’re doing.’ Ultimately you organise them, do the work during the week, but then there is a responsibility. That’s why the players are paid very good wages: they can’t be looking round and saying: ‘We want the manager to tell us what to do.’ They have to have a bit of responsibility themselves.”
Moyes, who replaced Slaven Bilic on an initial six-month contract, said he is confident of bringing success to West Ham. “I don’t think it’s a bad team, a bad squad. But I can’t be bothered with any drivel. I’m going to be direct with the players. If they don’t like it, then I’m sorry. We’ve got to make sure we get through to them quickly. If it works, great. If it doesn’t, then I’ll see the East End of London for seven months, then I’ll go elsewhere.”


Chris Coleman had just delivered his pre-match instructions at the Stade de France when he got a whisper in his ear. He may have been hoping Antoine Griezmann or Kylian Mbappé had been pulled out during the pre-match warmups in Paris, but instead the news was about another blow for Gareth Bale.
The Real Madrid forward had suffered a fresh thigh injury just days after returning to training after more than a month out with a calf injury and is likely to be out for the rest of the year. This will be his 19th layoff during his four years at the Bernabéu.
“I don’t know the full extent of it,” Coleman said. “He’ll be devastated. We haven’t had dialogue with Real Madrid, but we’ll speak with Gareth in the next few days and find out exactly what it is. It’s bad luck, bad news, and he’ll be gutted.
“The harder you try to get back you get a setback and sometimes you have to go through that. He’ll get over and he’ll be back. He just needs to get settled again and get his fitness. He needs to take his time and not rush himself back.”
Ryan Giggs also had his international career interrupted by injury before he retired from Wales duty in 2007. He went on to wear the red shirt of Manchester United for another seven years, setting a Premier League appearance record and becoming the most decorated footballer in English football history. But his injury woes did not just disappear by chance. Giggs began practising yoga in his late 20s before undergoing acupuncture and using ice baths to give his muscles the best opportunity to recover during the day-to-day grind.
“Some players as they get older they change their schedule,” said Coleman, whose side face Panama at the Cardiff City Stadium on Tuesday. “That’s up to him and Real Madrid. When he’s with us all our players have different programmes at different times of the week because we know what they do with their clubs. We have to make sure we taper that in with the way we work.”
Bale has missed 40 of Real Madrid’s last 60 matches and has been absent for Wales in crucial World Cup qualifiers against Serbia, Georgia and the Republic of Ireland. But Coleman gave a glimpse into the future when he unleashed Ben Woodburn and the debutants David Brooks and Ethan Ampadu off the bench during Friday night’s 2-0 defeat by France. “Between now and the next campaign we need to get these boys as much experience as we can. They will get better, stronger, and in 12 months’ time the squad that will be available will be better than the one we took to the Euros. It’s not all doom and gloom.”


Gareth Southgate has said his successor as England manager may end up benefiting most from the current setup’s commitment to youth progression, with a trio of players from the England under-21s called up for Tuesday’s friendly against Brazil.
The Bournemouth midfielder Lewis Cook is to join Liverpool’s Dominic Solanke and the Norwich goalkeeper Angus Gunn, who is on loan from Manchester City, in the senior squad for the game at Wembley having played in the juniors’ 2-0 European Championship qualifying win in Ukraine on Friday.
The three were being checked by the Football Association’s medics on Saturday night with Southgate, having originally envisaged elevating Solanke – a scorer at Kiev’s Obolon Arena – Dominic Calvert-Lewin and Demarai Gray, opting instead for players in positions where the seniors require greater cover.
Southgate had described the decision to blood more youngsters, who had made such a favourable impression in the eye‑catching success in junior tournaments over the summer, as a no brainer after seeing a young England team draw 0-0 with the reigning world champions, Germany, on Friday.
Cook captained the under-20s to their World Cup win and Solanke earned the tournament’s Golden Ball with four goals in England’s success, with their elevation to the squad to play Brazil part of the senior setup’s long-term strategy to offer a pathway to progress.
“I’ve got to assess who are the players that I think could play at the highest level,” said Southgate. “They might not be 100% ready now, but who do we want to invest our time in? Ruben [Loftus‑Cheek], [Joe] Gomez, when he came on, and Jordan Pickford have shown some really good qualities. [Harry] Winks is the same. We had to get the balance through qualification. We had to qualify and then we could start to look at some of these guys and see what was possible.
“It’s not going to all happen before the World Cup, and some of them might not be ready for next summer, but there are exciting young English players coming through which is encouraging.
“Whether it is me that benefits from that or the next manager, the reason I was given the job was that I have an understanding of what is coming through. We’ve looked at what Germany have done over a period of time and want to establish a pathway for our young players. If we do that, the technical type of player that is coming through our system now and the athletic profile we have got could be really exciting.
“Our job is to analyse why other countries’ teams are being successful and what does our system look like. I have to say huge credit to the clubs for developing the sort of players they are developing, but we would be foolish not to see the signs of Spain and Germany being successful following on from success at youth level and sticking with some continuity with the way they play and the people involved.
“For me it is all about the bigger picture and what is right for England. I haven’t enjoyed watching us play in all our games but away in Germany, against Spain and Germany at home I’ve enjoyed the performance.”
Joe Hart will start in goal against Brazil although Jack Butland would have played had he not broken a finger in training on the eve of the Germany match. Phil Jones, England’s most capped starter on Friday, with 24 appearances, aggravated a slight thigh problem picked up in Manchester United’s defeat at Huddersfield and is to return to Manchester United for treatment and is ruled out, with Gary Cahill likely to step back into the side. Marcus Rashford should start, but Southgate will assess Loftus-Cheek, Gomez and Tammy Abraham to determine the extent of their involvement.
“The Germany game will have taken a lot out of all of them, and Tuesday will be a much harder test because of the effort we put in,” Southgate said. “Very often you can go into one game and do really well and then you have to find that level of performance so quickly again. We’ll have to think about the team we pick and who is ready, but whatever happens these two games will be a brilliant experience for us.”


Easy to read, difficult to beat. The Denmark manager, Age Hareide, took no satisfaction from the fact that his pre-match assessment of this Republic of Ireland team turned out to be prophetic. Martin O’Neill, meanwhile, is happy that Ireland’s World Cup fate will be determined in Dublin, a goalless draw ensuring the suspense in this play-off will carry over into Tuesday’s second leg.
O’Neill conceded, mind you, that his team will have to show more creativity to profit from their home advantage. It would have been ludicrous to claim otherwise given that here they treated the ball like almost as much of an adversary as the Danes, with both kept mostly at a distance. Each manager complained afterwards about the bumpiness of the pitch but the Danish players made it look smoother than the Irish.
“We would obviously want to be better with the ball in Dublin,” said O’Neill. “We’ll need to be, in all honesty, to score a goal. [The tie] is very evenly poised. [Hareide] said they’re capable of scoring at the Aviva and I wouldn’t doubt that. With the players they possess they’re capable of scoring a goal so we might have to score two to win the match. But we’re capable of that.”
Ireland will be at full strength on Tuesday, as none of their eight players who started this leg on a yellow card received another one. David Meyler, forced to sit this out, will return from suspension. This was a disciplined and spirited Irish performance. Yes, the highlights of the clash could be condensed into a couple of minutes but this team will enter Irish football’s history books if the eventual outcome is qualification for a first World Cup since 2002.
As for those highlights, Darren Randolph will feature prominently. The goalkeeper made three fine saves here to thwart the Danes when they managed to penetrate the Irish defence. All that was missing for the visitors was a breakaway goal, which Cyrus Christie almost pinched just before half-time before being foiled by Kasper Schmeichel.
Despite knowing how Ireland would play, Hareide probably did not foresee the inclusion in Ireland’s staring lineup of Callum O’Dowda, the 22-year-old whose only previous start for his country was in the relatively sedate setting of last month’s home match against Moldova. Deploying the Bristol City winger on the right enabled O’Neill to shift Robbie Brady into the central midfield berth vacated by Meyler, thus, in theory, giving Ireland more thrust than they would have had if the more experienced Glen Whelan had started instead. That selection raised the possibility that O’Neill had not been bluffing in the previews when declaring his intention to “go for it”. Wrong. He was bluffing.
After some helter-skelter early exchanges, the contest settled into the pattern that Hareide predicted, Denmark dominating and Ireland defending deeply and doggedly. The role of Daryl Murphy, alone up front for the visitors, seemed ceremonial.
Although the Danes regularly fed Christian Eriksen in the hope that the Tottenham Hotspur schemer would concoct some ingenious way of unpicking a defence led by Shane Duffy, the hosts were not overly intricate and did not forsake the aerial route. That path would have led to a goal in the 10th minute if not for two saves by Randolph. The Middlesbrough goalkeeper parried a volley from the left-hand side of the box by Stryger Larsen after a long diagonal pass by Simon Kjaer and then blocked the follow-up by Andrea Cornelius.
Before fading in the second half Eriksen created mischief in the tight space between the Irish midfield and defence. In the 22nd minute his long-range shot brought a routine save from Randolph. The goalkeeper was in greater difficulty when Eriksen tried again 10 minutes later, his effort swirling so wildly that the goalkeeper spilled it. Randolph was grateful to see Pione Sisto guide the rebound wide.
Schmeichel was just another frustrated spectator until the 42nd minute, when Christie dashed down the right and into the box in a manner in which the injured Seamus Coleman would have been proud. The right-back tried to dink the ball over Schmeichel from close range but the goalkeeper stood strong.
The steadfastness of Ireland’s resistance seemed to cause Denmark to lose their poise. The second half descended into a scrappy duel, suiting the visitors more than the hosts. Eager for a twist, the home crowd cheered Nicklas Bendtner’s introduction in the 73rd minute. The former Arsenal and Sunderland striker made no impact. Yussuf Poulsen, however, nearly snatched a goal in the last minute but Randolph tipped his close-range header over the bar.


Kansas City Chiefs defensive tackle Roy Miller was arrested early Saturday in Florida on a domestic battery charge, according to Duval County jail records.
A copy of the arrest report acquired by the Guardian said officers responded to a call of a domestic battery at 12:15am on Saturday morning.
Miller’s wife of six and a half years, Nicole, told police the couple had spent the night on a date at the Jacksonville Zoo before traveling home in separate Ubers, where an argument over her husband’s whereabouts escalated to a physical confrontation.
Nicole Miller told police her husband grabbed her by the hair, struck her in the face and tore a braid from the back of her head, adding that he threw her phone in the toilet and physically restrained her from retrieving it. Ultimately, she was able to recover her phone from the toilet and call police.
Roy Miller was jailed shortly before 5am by the Jacksonville sheriff’s office. The incident involved a minor injury, but no other details were available about the alleged battery.
Local news outlets reported that Miller was released on his own recognizance after an initial court appearance Saturday. Another hearing was set for 28 November.
The Chiefs, who are off this week, said in statement to the Associated Press that they were aware of the incident and gathering facts. They declined any further comment.
The 30-year-old Miller, who was drafted out of Texas by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, spent the past four seasons with the Jacksonville Jaguars. Miller signed a $1.4m deal with Kansas City this past offseason but has only appeared in seven games with two tackles.
The AFC West-leading Chiefs (6-3) visit the New York Giants on 18 November.


Michael Cheika may have just overseen Australia’s 13th consecutive win over Wales but he was already bristling at the prospect of taking on England on Saturday.
“We understand the pundits over here don’t think we have much of a chance,” he said. “They have already given England 3-0 for November. One guy said: ‘All respect to Australia, but a decent club side would beat them.’ So I don’t think there is too much for them to worry about. We will prepare every day like we are going to play our best game on Saturday and go from there.”
Naturally, when Australia and England meet these days, thoughts turn to the battle of wits between Cheika and Eddie Jones, his old mate from Randwick. Cheika did his best to insist, as ever, that there was nothing in it. “It is irrelevant. It is Australia versus England, that’s all that counts. It is not about ‘fun’ with Eddie. We will have fun on our own in camp, and then we will prepare ourselves each day the best we can.”
For Wales, the misery of that 13th defeat in a row to opponents they must face again in the pool stages of the World Cup in two years’ time was compounded by the likelihood Jonathan Davies’s autumn is over. “It looks like an ankle injury,” Warren Gatland said. “He’s just being strapped up and is on crutches. It doesn’t look brilliant, but we’ll know more in the next 24 hours.”
To lose a player of such experience from Wales’s new-look midfield would be a terrible blow but Gatland was pleased with how the three players making their home debuts played, as well as the blooding of three new caps from the bench. He rued the controversial try with which Australia took their lead out to 13 at the start of the final quarter while Wales were pressing to retake the lead. Nevertheless, he was not of a mind to make anything of it.
“If Kurtley Beale hadn’t scored that freakish try, there was a good chance we could have won the game. I haven’t had a look at [the knock-on]. Sometimes those decisions go for you. It’s one of those things. I’m not going to dwell on that.”
A run of 13 like that might be enough to disturb some. Wales, though, are adamant there is no mental block for them when it comes to playing Australia. “No, not at all,” said their captain, Alun Wyn Jones. “We showed our attacking approach in spades out there. We need to work on the balance of how, when and where we do that. We don’t want to be doing it in our own 22, because if you give teams like that too much time in your 22 they’ll take those gifts and keep the pressure on. I definitely wouldn’t say it’s a mental block, because we’ve come too close for it to be that.
“We probably should have [won]. We’ve got to stay confident and keep playing this way.”
On Saturday, a win against Georgia is non-negotiable, before attention turns to the All Blacks. Their record against them, of course, is even worse.


Mike Brown, full-back, 6/10 At ease under the high ball – and there were plenty in the opening quarter – but made way after landing horribly on his head when taken out in the air. Has had concussion problems before, so it is a concern indeed.
Anthony Watson, wing, 7/10 Not in the circumstances he would have wanted but had an hour to show what he can do at full-back and acquitted himself well with his dancing feet and safe hands. It may be that he stays there for the autumn.
Jonathan Joseph, centre, 5/10 Looked lively early on but faded. Eddie Jones has fears that he does not physically impose himself on teams and there was little evidence to suggest otherwise here. Not the ball-carrier England were crying out for.
Henry Slade, centre, 6/10 Glimpses of that effortless grace that convinces you he has a long international future ahead of him but no more than that. Set up Semesa Rokoduguni but did not really click with George Ford.
Elliot Daly, wing, 5/10 Nicknamed Lazarus for his powers of recovery but in hindsight maybe he ought to have had the day off. Very little space to work in. Not really his fault but Jonny May comes into contention for Australia.
George Ford, fly-half, 6/10 Missed first kick at goal but steadied himself. His pass to Nathan Hughes was marvellous but there was not much more of that. Could not really click with Slade but that is not to write off the partnership just yet.
Ben Youngs, scrum-half, 6/10 Was perhaps England’s brightest star last autumn but must take some of the blame for their sluggishness here. It was his first international since March which may explain why, but he knows he can do better.
Mako Vunipola, prop, 8/10 Hates training, according to Jones, but loves playing. Made the hard yards with some strong carries, kept on tackling and showed good hands, too. Excellent performance – certainly did not look in need of a rest.
Dylan Hartley (capt), hooker, 6/10 Took it upon himself to try to add some urgency into England in the second half and relished his battle with Agustín Creevy. Hardly his fault for the sense of ennui that engulfed proceedings.
Dan Cole, prop, 6/10 As ever, got stuck in at scrum time and even had a carry or two. Cannot be faulted for England’s lack of dynamism but this match called out for someone such as Kyle Sinckler.
Courtney Lawes, lock, 7/10 Not quite at his very best – which he has consistently shown of late – but does come out of the match in credit, which cannot be said of everyone. Kept offering himself to carry but made little headway.
George Kruis, lock, 5/10 Made his tackles but could not muster any momentum in heavy traffic. Gave away a couple of penalties, too. Such are England’s second-row reserves, his place is likely to come under pressure next week.
Chris Robshaw, flanker, 6/10 Had a rumble into space early on and will always stick to his task. Can look a bit laborious, though, which is magnified in matches such as this. Will never want for effort, though.
Sam Underhill, flanker, 8/10 Did everything asked of him on his first Test here and it is the quality just as much as the quantity of his tackles that impresses. One of the defensive leaders, so takes credit for how blunt the Pumas were.
Nathan Hughes, No8, 7/10 Outrageous bit of juggling for the try which proved one of few occasions the crowd rose to their feet. Was outstanding in Argentina over the summer and continues to grow into the jersey.

If it is this easy on Wednesday, when World Rugby meets to decide the hosts of the 2023 World Cup, the bookies should close the book on Ireland now. Joe Schmidt had urged his players for a performance that would put the country “in the shop window” before the vote against South Africa and France. They answered his call and then some – dominating from the off before twisting the knife in the last 10 minutes to record their biggest ever victory over the Springboks.
True, the final score of 38-3, following three late tries, flattered the hosts a little. But it was impossible not to admire the way Johnny Sexton controlled the game, by turns frustrating and lacerating the Springboks, or how the Irish barely gave their opponents a sniff, even during a strangely flat period in the opening 15 minutes of the second half.
By then Ireland had plenty of points in hand, helped by a first-half try from Andrew Conway and Sexton’s serene kicking. And as the South Africans faded, Rhys Ruddock, Rob Herring and Jacob Stockdale went over to ensure Ireland steamrollered past their previous biggest win against the Springboks, a 17-point victory in 2006.
This game, played between two of the protagonists bidding for the 2023 World Cup, was always going to carry extra piquancy. That much was evident as early as the first minute as the giant Springbok prop Coenie Oosthuizen was launched backwards in the tackle by Sexton and Bundle Aki.
It was not only a statement from the Irish but a gameplan wrecker. Oosthuizen, one of the best scrummagers in world rugby, was carted off with what looked like a twisted knee and from the resulting scrum Ireland were able to take advantage, applying the squeeze and earning the first penalty of the night, which Sexton duly converted.
Inevitably there were more meaty exchanges, especially in the first half – the crowd roared when Iain Henderson trampled over the South Africa captain, Eben Etzebeth – no mean feat given he is 6ft 8in and over 18 stone – only to gasp when Sean O’Brien was given the same treatment seconds later by François Louw.
Yet with Ireland more than matching their opponents up front, Sexton was able to control the game. Quickly the South African penalties began to mount – along with points from the Sexton boot. Another three came when the Bok second row Lood De Jager was slow to roll away from the breakdown, and another penalty, this time from a loose kick in the ruck, allowed Sexton to put Ireland 9-0 ahead after 20 minutes.
Even at that stage the difference in the quality between the half backs was obvious. Ireland had Connor Murray and Sexton, with 123 caps and multiple levels of telepathy between them. South Africa’s pairing of Ross Cronje and Elton Jantjies had just 26 caps. Jantjies had looked confident in scoring 52 points against France in three Tests in June, but the experience of a damp and grisly November evening in Dublin was proving a very different ball game.
Ireland were wearing a new dark-grey shirt for the first time in this game, which clearly clashed with the dark green of their opponents. Yet Sexton had few problems finding his team-mates and after another period of pressure Ireland deservedly scored their first try on 24 minutes.
In truth the score came from nowhere. Murray attempted a fiddly little box kick, perfectly directed between the South Africa wing Courtnall Skosan and Conway, and as Skosan flapped, Conway pounced. In the blink of an eye he was able to scamper down the touchline and swallow dive over the try line.
It took the South Africans the best part of 30 minutes to put together multiple phases and show some hints of their quality. It led to their first excursion near the try line, only for CJ Stander – who represented South Africa at grade level before switching under residency rules last year – to save the day.
The visitors were out early for the second half and a renewed sense of urgency was rewarded with their first points through the boot of Jantjies. For the next 15 minutes the game was a messy splodge, but just before the hour the impeccable Sexton was able to steady the ship with another penalty, to put Ireland 17-3 up.
Even then no one could have predicted what would happen in the final 15 minutes. Ireland looked to have merely made the game safe when Ruddock capitalised on fine work from Conway, to sneak over the line, but the home side had sensed the South Africans were out on their feet. And in the game’s final moments Herring and then Stockdale crashed over to add a bright gloss to their victory, while also perhaps sending a little message to World Rugby too.


A cold, sorry November Saturday, and at Twickenham a first gathering of the clan since the Six Nations, and that 13-9 defeat to Ireland at the Aviva Stadium. The crowd’s enthusiasm was unaffected by the late morning weather, a steady, dismal drizzle, the kind that soaks you through without you even really noticing that you’re getting wet.
All the talk around the ground, now, speculation about exactly where England stand, back-and-forths over whether Dylan Hartley should still be skipper or Jamie George starting at hooker instead, who should play at lock, and if Mike Brown was still the right man at full-back. After Eddie Jones blooded 11 players on the tour of Argentina, England feel a less settled side now than they did on the other side of the summer.
Three of those rookies, Harry Williams, Alex Lozowski and Sam Underhill, made the squad for this match. A fourth, Tom Curry, was picked too but dislocated his wrist and was replaced by the uncapped Sam Simmonds. All of which made this feel like an early look at the team Jones hopes England will be the next time they play Argentina, in the pool stages of the World Cup. That match is two years away, and from here on in, everyone is auditioning for a place in the squad. No one’s going to get cast off on the back of this match, though. It was an ordinary performance that left, as Hartley put it, “a lot to work on”. So, at the end of 80 minutes, the answers to those questions were not necessarily much clearer.
On the openside, at least, Underhill did well enough to earn modest praise from Jones. “He’s a good little player, and he’ll only get better,” Jones said. “He looks like he can be a genuine seven for us.”
England think so highly of him they made him one of their two defensive captains for the match. People have been talking about Underhill as England’s next No7 for a long while now, since he captained the Under-18 team to the European Championship in 2014. They were unbeaten that season. When Underhill fetched up at the Ospreys while he was studying at Cardiff University, the RFU development coaches Richard Hill and Joe Lydon would pop across the Severn to watch him play.
When the Welsh papers started talking about whether Underhill might qualify for Wales through residency, the RFU was quick to let him know that he was wanted back in England. And as soon as he moved to Bath, he was called up to the senior squad. Here, in his first start at Twickenham, the crowd got a first live look at him in an England shirt. It’s quite a sight. Underhill has the upper body of a cartoon superhero, with arms that seem to dangle at acute angles because his oversized muscles push them out away from his frame. His shoulders seem ideally suited for slinging things over: sacks, logs, hostages from pillaged villages, Argentinian runners.
Early in the first half, Argentina sent their inside-centre Santiago González Iglesias hurtling down Underhill’s channel off the back of a lineout. Iglesias shaped to step around George Ford and into Underhill’s path, which, he swiftly realised, was something like swerving around a car into the path of an oncoming bus. Underhill hit him clean in the midriff with a tackle that left him flat and panting, the kind of blow which TV directors love to play over and again in slow motion. Iglesias left Underhill well alone after that, but it was the first clip in a highlights reel of Underhill’s hard hits on the opposition.
It was followed in short order by a couple of eye-watering tackles on lock Tomás Lavanini, one of which knocked him way, way back the way he had come; another on Ramiro Moyano, who was brought up like he had collided with a brick wall, and a brutal clear-out on Agustín Creevy. Anyone in an Argentina shirt who came Underhill’s way ended up flat on their backs, though Pablo Matera did slip by him on the right wing at one point.
Five minutes from time, when Argentina strung together 20-odd phases in England’s 22, Underhill was still busy hacking them down, and battered over Joaquín Tuculet in the far corner as he closed in on the try-line.
So he no doubt made his mark on the Argentinians, in all those black and blue bruises. That will not be enough in the long run, though; Jones will want more from him. The game seemed to flow around Underhill when England had the ball in hand, and he did not have the kind of impact at the breakdown that he often does when playing in the Premiership. When he conceded a penalty by coming off his feet midway through the second half, Jones exploded in anger, shouting something like: “Fuck, how fucking stupid are we?” and smashed his fist on to the table in front of him.
Jones said that he had forgotten about that after the match, and that, like as not, it was irritation at England’s overall performance as much as it was Underhill’s mistake. Among the rest of the rookies, Lozowski showed well when he came on, and made England’s second try with a swift break, but otherwise, the match was a slog – a “grindathon” as Jones called it. “These games happen,” he said. Hopefully not too often.


Such a familiar tale, particularly in a Welsh autumn. New combinations, plenty of promise, and, as usual, defeat by Australia. This was a 13th consecutive such loss and, despite a surfeit of possession and more than enough evidence of the wit to use it, runs like that cannot be put down to hard luck, however much it might have felt that Wales were – are – better than this. Points are all that matters in sport, and if a team don’t score enough of them they don’t win.
Australia spent much of the match on the back foot, particularly in the second half, but they scored four tries to Wales’s two and need say no more than that. Both sides saw this as a chance to experiment, each fielding a new style of midfield, Wales shifting away from their traditional power in that department, Australia doing the opposite. Neither side will be disappointed with the results, but it was Australia’s ball-players, still there if in new positions, who prevailed, Will Genia, Bernard Foley and Kurtley Beale pulling Wales apart at those clutch moments.
Worse still, Jonathan Davies suffered a nasty-looking ankle injury in the last play, as Wales tried forlornly to close the deficit further after Hallam Amos’s late try had represented reward, if hopelessly too late, for long periods of pressure. With Georgia, New Zealand and South Africa still to visit this autumn, Wales will hope against hope their depleted side is not further weakened by the loss of one of their senior players, but the omens for Davies do not look good.
If the impression were to form –again – that Wales were unlucky here against Australia, grievances might settle around Australia’s fourth try, a breakaway by Beale in the 63rd minute, which Australia’s full-back clearly knew ought not to be awarded, so quickly did he drop-kick the conversion. Glen Jackson, the referee, hadn’t blown yet, so he referred to the TMO, but their investigations centred on a previous tackle, the height of which turned out to be legal, rather than the moments to follow in which Beale clearly dropped the ball for a split second, before scampering away half the length to the posts.
At that point, Wales were a mere six points behind and causing Australia all manner of problems, the visitors conceding penalty after penalty and they were about to lose a player to the sin-bin. How Wales would have liked to enter that 10-minute spell six points behind, rather than the 13 to which Beale’s controversial try stretched Australia’s lead.
But a 13th consecutive defeat to the same opponents tells its own tale, despite the promise and the what-might-have-beens. All three players making their home debuts played well, particularly Steff Evans, who continued the bustling form that has made his case for selection unanswerable. Wales were inventive, their handling slick, but momentary lapses kept costing them, just as they built to the killer touch.
No such problem for Australia. This victory was built on three first-half tries that seemed all too easy to score, which is precisely what the best players make them look. The cleverness of Foley’s kicking set up the first two, the first a driven lineout finished by Tatafau Polota-Nau, the second clinched by a superb flat pass by Genia to Adam Coleman, who burst onto it for a gallop to the line.
In between, Wales hit a peak of cohesion with the best try of the game. Gareth Davies broke round the fringes of a line-out, and slick handling set Evans away, who cut inside one and through another to score their first. The resultant lead was short-lived, Wales unable to secure the restart, Coleman’s try swift to follow.
An exchange of penalties paved the way for the ever-deadly score on the stroke of half-time, and it was, inevitably, Australia who took it. Tevita Kuridrani and Beale probed in a lengthy approach, before Beale sent his captain, Michael Hooper, on an arcing run to the line. Suddenly, Wales were turning round nine points adrift.
Theirs was the second half, at least in terms of energy. Australia stood strong in the face of wave after wave of attack, but their rising penalty count hinted at a team struggling with the tempo. How grateful they were for the insurance of Beale’s outlandish score. Evans set off on another run, but somehow Beale managed to smuggle the ball off him in a tackle. His stealth went all but unnoticed, still less his little spill, until he strolled clear from his own half to score Australia’s fourth amid bemused silence.
With quarter of an hour to play, Wales’s hopes were fading, notwithstanding the yellow card Hooper saw for conceding penalty No13. They chased the game desperately, their furious pressure undermined by that familiar sense of futility against these opponents. They came so close in those final 10 minutes, spilling the ball inches short, grounding it inches short, Amos bundled into touch by a matter of millimetres. At the umpteenth attempt, they did score that second, Amos this time squeezing into the corner, but the points came too late. Davies’s injury at the death was but the final insult.

Eddie Jones has defended his foul-mouthed outburst during England’s win over Argentina after he was caught by TV cameras venting his fury at his side’s laborious showing.
England managed two tries – one in either half from Nathan Hughes and Semesa Rokoduguni – in a lifeless showing that hardly impressed a near-capacity Twickenham. Jones’s anger was evident when he was shown on the TV screens during the match slamming his notepad and shouting, “How fucking stupid are we?” after a second-half penalty given away by Sam Underhill.
Asked about his televised rage, Jones said: “I haven’t seen it. How frustrated? Throwing stuff? That is pretty frustrated. We want to play well, we want to play good rugby, and I don’t see any reason why I shouldn’t be frustrated.”
Jones conceded that England’s 20th win from 21 matches in his tenure will not live long in the memory and blamed their rustiness on a lack of preparation, particularly for his British & Irish Lions. “It was a grindathon, wasn’t it,” he said. “We were off the pace a little bit, but there were some things we did really well. The reality is we haven’t played a game since March together – we had players coming back from the Lions who had only done two training sessions, so our fluency and our understanding was not there.
“We had opportunities to score more points and we just couldn’t. Every time we created something a pass would go behind, a pass would go ahead, a pass would go to the wrong person. We just lacked that understanding – the good thing was we created some opportunities.”
Jones is likely to make changes for next Saturday’s fixture against Australia and Mike Brown will have to go through the relevant protocols after he was replaced midway through the first half after a nasty blow to the head. His opposite number, Joaquín Tuculet, was shown a yellow card for taking Brown out in the air. “He will have to do a return to play; he was hit pretty heavily,” said Jones. “We lose a player for the whole game, they lose a player for 10 minutes.”
In Brown’s absence, Anthony Watson switched to full-back and is likely to start there against the Wallabies if Brown is ruled out. Owen Farrell and Maro Itoje will also come into the picture after they were rested on Saturday.
“We know how we want to play against Australia,” Jones said. “We’ve got a very clear vision of how we want to play against Australia and it should be fun. We are hoping Australia bring their absolute best game. These games are about seeing where we are at.”
Hughes also switched his attention to the Wallabies. He said: “It’s not a concern; we wanted to come out here and put in a good performance. There were a lot of opportunities that we didn’t finish off. We go back and review it, and we’ll have a look at Australia thoroughly, and we’ll be ready to go.”


• Bloomfield Road started the day at the centre of increased attention and by full-time, it was much the same after Portsmouth ran out victorious from a five-goal thriller. It has not been a dull week at Blackpool. On Monday, the club’s owners, the Oyston family, were ordered to pay £31m at a high court ruling, and four days later, they put the club up for sale. In between all of that, the EFL removed the referee, Ben Toner, from the fixture, citing heightened scrutiny around the match-up.
The game itself did not come alive until the second period, with all five goals coming inside 34 second-half minutes. Brett Pitman, the striker, captain and lifelong poacher poked home from close range before Viv Solomon-Otabor levelled with 16 minutes to play. Then Ben Close, the Portsmouth academy graduate, hammered home his first goal for the club, and what he must have felt was the winner, with 10 minutes to play. But Blackpool levelled when Oliver Hawkins sent his headed clearance beyond his own goalkeeper, Luke McGee. It was Pitman, though, who had the last laugh, peeling off at the back post before slotting home his 11th goal of the season. “We gave it away cheaply and the manner of the goals was not acceptable,” Gary Bowyer said.
The numbers are not just adding up for Pitman. Another forward full of goals at the moment, Kieffer Moore, secured Rotherham United a point in the early kick-off at Doncaster Rovers. Moore, the Ipswich Town loanee who arrived at the club via Truro City and a stint in Norway, popped up with a timely 96th-minute equaliser for Paul Warne’s side. Moore has scored 13 league goals this season, more than any other player in England’s top four tiers.
• Remi Matthews is unlikely to forget Plymouth Argyle’s November trip to Valley Parade in a hurry. The Norwich City goalkeeper, making just his third start for his loan club, superbly denied Tony McMahon from the penalty spot, to condemn Bradford City to consecutive home league defeats for the first time since 2015. Jake Jervis put Argyle, who move off the bottom with this win, ahead after 35 minutes before Matthews’s second-half heroics. Bury replace them after they were pegged back late on by Gillingham, Josh Parker rescuing a 1-1 draw at Priestfield.
• Things went from bad to worse for Bristol Rovers manager Darrell Clarke at Scunthorpe United. Clarke had spoken bullishly in the week, adamant he would see a reaction from his side after three straight defeats. His team are now winless in four matches after Neal Bishop bagged a 94th-minute winner at Glanford Park. “We have copped a lot of flak,” Clarke said. “But we will keep going as a group, put the shutters up and we want to get back to winning football matches.” Bishop, whose team move up to fifth, said: “They came and put 11 men in their own half but we kept probing and believing a winner would come.” Elsewhere, MK Dons beat Fleetwood Town 1-0 while Northampton Town beat Oxford United 2-1 at the Kassam Stadium, with Chris Long the match-winner.
Results: Blackpool 2-3 Portsmouth, Bradford City 0-1 Plymouth Argyle, Doncaster Rovers 1-1 Rotherham United, Gillingham 1-1 Bury, MK Dons 1-0 Fleetwood Town, Oxford United 1-2 Northampton Town, Scunthorpe United 1-0 Bristol Rovers.
• At least the travelling Yeovil Town supporters making the 660-mile round trip to Carlisle United had a free pie and pint, courtesy of Darren Way and his squad upon arrival. But for the second time in two seasons, such generosity was matched by the Glovers’ defence. Danny Grainger’s unstoppable strike from 30 yards opening the scoring after seven minutes, before he slotted home a mysteriously awarded penalty from the spot to make it 3-0. In injury-time, Shaun Miller completed the rout for Keith Curle’s side, who are up to 14th.
• Late goals were all the rage, with Swindon Town and Cheltenham Town both scoring in stoppage time. Luke Norris slotted home from 12 yards to earn Swindon a draw in the 96th minute at home to Chesterfield, while Gary Johnson’s side snatched a point against free-scoring Luton Town at Whaddon Road, with Will Boyle bagging a 97th-minute equaliser. “The boys really, really worked hard,” Johnson, whose team are 16th, said. “I think it has got us a point nearer the play-offs, so people are telling me, and we have stopped Luton running away with it.”
• A point was ultimately enough for Notts County to retain top spot, although they made hard work of it at Stevenage. Danny Newton put the hosts in front before Elliot Hewitt struck an equaliser, after good work by Nottingham Forest loanee Jorge Grant. County’s shirts bore the name of the Nottingham-born singer Jake Bugg, who has sponsored their shirts for November. Exeter City continue to breathe down their necks after a routine 2-0 win over Grimsby Town, in which Jayden Stockley scored his seventh goal of the campaign.
• A stunner from Alex MacDonald was the difference at the Ricoh Arena as Mansfield Town beat Coventry City 1-0. Lincoln City came from behind to thrash Crewe Alexandra 4-1, with Harry Anderson starring at Gresty Road while Morecambe beat in-form Wycombe Wanderers 2-1. Elsewhere, Crawley Town earned a 1-1 draw with Forest Green Rovers, Cambridge United played out a stalemate with high-flying Accrington Stanley and Colchester United beat Barnet, with Rossi Eames’s side now winless since 9 September.
Results: Barnet 0-1 Colchester United, Cambridge United 0-0 Accrington Stanley, Carlisle United 4-0 Yeovil Town, Cheltenham Town 2-2 Luton Town, Coventry City 0-1 Mansfield Town, Crawley Town 1-1 Forest Green Rovers, Crewe Alexandra 1-4 Lincoln City, Exeter City 2-0 Grimsby Town, Morecambe 2-1 Wycombe Wanderers, Newport County 1-1 Port Vale (Friday), Stevenage 1-1 Notts County, Swindon 2-2 Chesterfield.


The buildup to Saturday’s Badger Ales Trophy started some time around the turn of the century, when a battered old-time jump jockey fobbed off his tiny daughter with a promise that she could sit on a racehorse one day, maybe when she was nine. Jimmy Frost, who had ridden the 1989 Grand National winner, hoped he would hear no more of the subject but Bryony did not forget and described in the winner’s enclosure here how she had bounded through to her father’s bedroom at dawn on her ninth birthday to insist he make good on his words.
Thirteen years after that moment of domestic tension, Bryony Frost delivered a brave, attacking ride on Present Man to land a race her father had won when she was a toddler. It was a vindication of the faith shown in her by Paul Nicholls, who took her on as an amateur jockey a couple of years ago and is giving her plenty of work now that she has turned professional.
Frost was quick to express her gratitude to the 10-times champion trainer, hinting that she may have struggled to have similar chances at other stables. “It’s a massive thing, because you’ve got to break the mould, being a girl and everything,” she said. “And he’s got the backbone to say: ‘No. I’ll put her up and you watch what she can do.’”
Frost Sr was on hand to share the moment and was by his daughter’s side before her horse had even walked off the track. He recalled spending 12 years trying to dissuade her from being a jump jockey before giving up the unequal struggle. “I know what a tough life it is. But she wouldn’t hear it,” he said.
“She had that fall 10 days ago and I said: ‘You want to take a few days off.’ She said: ‘No, they’ll think I’m a wuss cos I’m a girl. I can’t do that. I’ve got to keep going.’ So if anything, it works the other way for her. She’s got to be tougher and work harder.”
Like her brother, Hadden, Frost Jr is already a winner at the Cheltenham Festival, having landed the Foxhunter on Pacha Du Polder in March, beating the best amateur jockeys from Ireland as well as England. Nicholls is now happy to make the most of the 5lb allowance she is allowed for her inexperience and praised her at various times for “a fantastic ride” and “a peach of a ride” as he celebrated his eighth success in this contest.
“She’s a very talented girl,” Nicholls said. “She’s been brought up right. She rides as well as all those lads.”
The trainer fielded three in the race and, after persistent rain for the previous 12 hours, was beginning to fear that Present Man had less chance than the others. “I knew he’d go in the ground, it’s just whether he’d stay in the ground. He’s a great example of, in this game, Rome wasn’t built in a day. He’s took three years to get where he is, from being fairly ordinary as a novice hurdler.”
Being owned by the sponsor, Present Man has had this race as the target for some time and it may be a mistake to expect much more from him this season. But the Grand National is reckoned to be a long-term target and there must be an excellent chance that Frost will keep the ride if the horse shows up at Aintree in April.
A fine day was also enjoyed by the trainer Ian Williams, who sent Saunter to win the November Handicap at Doncaster and also landed the Elite Hurdle here with London Prize.
Williams said: “It’s not a bad 20 minutes to have in any training career. It’s lovely to do it on the Flat and over jumps.”
He may have another go with London Prize at Cheltenham next Sunday in the Greatwood Hurdle, which had been the horse’s original target. “We went to Wincanton because the owners weren’t available on Greatwood day. It depends on what the handicapper does and if he’s bucking and squealing.”

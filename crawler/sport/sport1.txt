It wasn’t immediately clear—contextually at least—why LaVar Ball chose to renew his feud with President Donald Trump on Thursday evening.
Context is often a relative term with Ball, of course. It’s a pretty pointless exercise trying to predict what the Big Baller Brand patriarch will do next, outside of assuming that it will be done at full volume.

Ball became a self-parody on Thursday in Philadelphia as the Lakers beat the 76ers on a three-pointer from Brandon Ingram. But the momentous win turned out to be more about LaVar than anyone else.
Fans at Wells Fargo Center glimpsed LaVar in his suite before the final buzzer, and  obviously LaVar riled them up and loved the whole thing. Then he met Joel Embiid and talked about how LaVar Ball is a genius. There was some other stuff too, better watched in this NBC video than typed out. To reduce LaVar to words on a page feels a bit like pouring water over an irritating yet entertaining fireworks display.

Ball was also busy on Twitter, pinning a gif to his page showing him dunking over a cartoon Trump, with the hashtags, "#thetrumpdunk" and "#stayinyolane."

As  CNN pointed out, the wording goes back to an interview Ball gave to Chris Cuomo in November, after his middle son LiAngelo had been released from detention in China for shoplifting.
Trump, who spoke with Chinese President Xi Jinping about the release of LiAngelo and two of his UCLA teammates, demanded that they thank him. LaVar took umbrage at Trump; Trump called LaVar an “ungrateful fool” and “a poor man’s version of Don King, but without the hair” on  Twitter.
"If you help, you shouldn't have to say anything," LaVar  told Cuomo. "Let him [Trump] do his political affairs and let me handle my son, and let's just stay in our lane."
It was all so painful to watch and read about, and now LaVar has ignited it all again, albeit with a pretty sweet piece of internet artwork. Because there’s no way Trump won’t respond, surely. Get ready for more completely unnecessary noise.



The black comedy I, Tonya, about the onetime champion figure skater Tonya Harding, is the cinematic definition of “You don’t know whether to laugh or cry.” The screenwriter, Steven Rogers, hopes “you’ll do a little of both.” And maybe both at once, sometimes through gritted teeth. The film, which doesn’t whitewash Harding, attempts a kind of redemption. At the very least, it gives you perspective: Tonya Harding never had a chance.
She is best remembered, of course, for figure skating’s most riveting tabloid moment: The kneecapping of Harding’s chief rival, Nancy Kerrigan. The media did such a good job of reducing Harding vs. Kerrigan to White Trash vs. Princess that many continue to misremember Harding as the assailant. The story, as often happens, is more layered than the headlines.

Rogers, who grew up in Harding’s home state of Washington, spent weeks interviewing the former athlete (banished from the sport for life in 1994) and her ex-husband, Jeff Gillooly. It was Gillooly’s delusional best friend, Shawn Eckhardt—Harding’s purported bodyguard and a self-described CIA operative—who hatched the cracked plan to prevent Kerrigan from competing at the 1994 Olympics. (She recovered in time to win a silver medal.)
The story is so nutty that Margot Robbie, the Australian actress who plays Harding, couldn’t believe it was true. “Margot was too young when it happened,” says Rogers, “and she kept complimenting me on my brilliant comic inventions, like Shane Stant [the attacker, a mook hired by Eckhardt] using his head to break a glass door to escape, rather the police baton he’d just bashed Nancy with. I had to reluctantly tell her it wasn’t my imagination.”

The real Harding was, briefly, the greatest female skater in the world, the only one who could pull off a triple axel (at one competition, she completed two), a talent never properly celebrated. She had a few things going against her, including her preferred performance soundtrack (rock music), her big-haired ’80s tackiness and a take-me-or-leave-me attitude that the snooty National Ice Skating Association loathed. Harding was admirably tough and ambitious, if judged by today’s standards. But she wasn’t strong enough to overcome, among other things, Gillooly, a violent and colossally inept man whose name became synonymous with kneecapping.
And then there was Harding’s working-class mother, LaVona Golden, who pushed her daughter by any means necessary. Rogers was unable to locate Golden. (Harding told him she didn’t know if her mother was alive or dead—“She might be living behind a porn shop in a trailer.”) But plenty of people witnessed her verbal and physical abuse of her daughter, including beating the young Harding with a hairbrush at a skating event. “The only thing Jeff and Tonya agreed on, and they agreed on nothing, was how bad LaVona was,” says Rogers.
He got the distinctive flavor of Golden from documentary footage, but he wrote the part for Allison Janney. “I’d written for her before, and she never got to play the parts. It was this not-very-funny joke between us,” says Rogers, who studied acting with Janney at New York’s Neighborhood Playhouse in the ’80s. “So I attached her to the role even before she read the script or agreed to do it. Her involvement was a condition of sale.” Simply put, he adds, “no one plays a mess as well as Allison.”
The film goes back and forth between recreations of documentary footage and Harding’s rise and fall as a skater. One of the “documentary” scenes features an older Golden, hooked up to an oxygen tank, an ear-nipping parakeet on her left shoulder. It’s a showstopper, though the bird, played by Little Man, nearly steals the scene from Janney. “Hands down, my favorite animal co-star ever, and I’ve had a few,” says the actress. “This bird did a lot for me.”
As did the breathtakingly ugly wig. “When I first saw myself in the mirror as LaVona, I thought, This is fantastic!” says Janney. “It’s the least I’ve ever looked like me, which was very freeing. Normally, I’m not a fan of watching myself; I get very picky, groaning over my nibbles and bits.”
After years of collecting Emmys (six) for her TV work—as The West Wing’s commanding and elegant C.J. Cregg, as a sexually adventurous housewife on Masters of Sex and as the domineering mother on the CBS sitcom Mom—the dearth of great Janney film roles is perplexing. “Shoehorn parts, like the director of the CIA or FBI,” is how Rogers describes what’s she’s generally offered. “But Allison is Viola Davis and Cate Blanchett. She’s got that kind of power. I wrote this part so there was no denying that.”
Rogers knew Janney would love the story because, as a teen, she was  a competitive figure skater. An accident put an end to that (she went through a plate glass window, severing arteries), but she remains a fan of the sport and vividly remembers watching a clearly distressed Harding skate at the 1992 Olympics.
“When Tonya’s lace broke, and then going up and crying to the judges—I just watched with my hands over my eyes,” says Janney. “I was mortified for this girl who was obviously implicated and guilty in some way. And, of course, the whole media thing of poor Nancy Kerrigan and ‘Why, why, why?!’ playing over and over. That press narrative was made for TV.”

In one of I, Tonya’s later scenes, Gillooly notices the reporters, who had been camped on his lawn for months, racing for their trucks. You glimpse the reason on his TV: footage of a white Bronco on a freeway, being chased by cops. “And right after O.J. was the Menendez brothers trial,” says Janney. “The triumvirate of the 24-hour news cycle.”
The film, directed by Craig Gillespie (Lars and the Real Girl), is a deft blend of satire and morality tale. Everyone is culpable, some more than others. (Bobby Cannavale represents the media in a scathingly funny turn as a Hard Copy reporter.) But Rogers’s script makes no attempt to answer the question of Harding’s involvement in the attack (she denies even knowing about it). Rather, says Janney, the film is about “seeing the complexities of what went on, and what environment Tonya grew up in. You get why she would find herself with this cast of characters.”
Young LaVona Golden makes her debut to Cliff Richard’s “Devil Woman” (Gillespie’s soundtrack of ’80s and ’90s radio hits is killer). She walks onto the ice in her street shoes, dragging 3-year-old Tonya by the arm, a cigarillo attached to her hand like a sixth finger. “Hey!” she shouts to the female instructor teaching a herd of young skaters. “Over here! I’ve got something I want to ask you.” There is no seduction with Golden. “I did wonder how I was going to get behind her,” says Janney with a laugh.
Golden was a challenge to humanize, this woman who relentlessly bullied her daughter and everyone else. The actress dug up some compassion from her own past. “LaVona talks about driving Tonya to practices at 5 a.m. and working all these waitressing jobs, with every penny going to her skating. I know what that’s like, because my parents did it for me. It’s a lot for a single parent.”
Janney goes on: “I think she saw her daughter had a hard road. Tonya didn’t have all the things that are seen to be necessary for a viable competitor for the U.S. In order to give her daughter a chance, she needed to be tough on her. And not to defend LaVona,” she adds, “but she didn’t think it should matter what music Tonya played. It only mattered that she was a great skater.”

A devastating scene near the end of the film captures the heartbreaking dysfunction. Mother and daughter have been estranged for years, but Golden visits Harding at one of her lowest moments, when she’s trapped in her home by a mob of reporters and cameramen. “LaVona puts herself in this awkward place of being a nice mother,” Janney says with a chuckle. “She has to express things she normally wouldn’t—soft, fuzzy feelings like: I’m proud of you, and you did good.”
Janney thinks Golden really felt those things, somewhere. But in the end, she betrays Harding once again. (Sorry, no spoilers.)
“She has a line, when she’s yelling at Tonya, ‘I hated my mother too, you know!’” says the actress, who thinks Golden was probably abused herself. Since Rogers couldn’t find her, that’s speculation. But watching documentary footage of Golden, says Janney, “I saw all her anger and bitterness about everything in her life.”
Rogers’s favorite line in the script never made it to the film. “LaVona says, ‘Tonya always said that growing up, everyone hit her. Well, it was just a natural reaction to being around her.’” Rogers laughs. “I kept badgering Craig to find a place for it.”
Never mind. Janney lobs plenty of choice zingers, including one of the best in the film: The older Golden—noticing that the film’s plot is shifting to the years when Harding stopped speaking to her mother—says to the camera, “My storyline is disappearing. What the fuck?!”
Janney relished that line. “I’ve wanted to say that in so many movies that I’ve been in.”

Despite declining television ratings and assorted controversies—concussions, anthem protests, Deflategate, Tom Brady’s weird diet—the National Football League remains a moneymaking juggernaut.
In March 2017, the NFL was projecting revenue for this year of $14 billion, according to  Sports Business Journal. (The final figures for 2017 haven’t been released yet). Goodell wants to make $25 billion by 2027. “Well, don’t we all?”  Sports Illustrated commented pithily in August 2016. “The difference is that a) Goodell said this out loud; and b) he may actually do it.” NFL ratings are down by around three million viewers per game from 2013 and 2014, Brian Goff of  Forbes reported in August. But that doesn’t seem to be affecting the league’s bottom line. Despite an attempted insurrection by Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, Goodell just signed a $200 million contract extension—recognition from NFL owners, at least, that their product remains a success story.
The gleaming lacquer of truckloads of profit can help conceal potential cracks in the NFL’s business model, though. Take this weekend’s game between the Buffalo Bills and the Indianapolis Colts at New Era Field, for example.  Newyorkupstate.com reported on Wednesday that tickets were selling for $4.
Four dollars. Granted the Colts are a woeful team in 2017, lacking the one player in Andrew Luck that casual, non-partisan football fans might be interested in turning up to watch live. Granted, too, that the Bills are hardly the worst offenders for live gates in the NFL.  ESPN says an average of 68,629 people have attended games at New Era Field this season, which is 93.9 percent of capacity. Good for 17th in the NFL. Not bad, not great—kind of like the Bills as a team.

They are still very much in the AFC playoff race, though, at 6-6. The Bills only need eminently plausible screw-ups from the Chiefs and Chargers to sneak in as a Wild Card team. That should be generating excitement. Instead, that same  Newyorkupstate article notes that tickets for Week 15 against the Dolphins are going for $15.
The Bills’ experiment with games in Toronto was a difficult one, sure. But if upstate New York can’t get excited about a playoff contender, then maybe the NFL should follow the dollar signs and shift the franchise 55 miles or so north to a Canadian metropolis. It hasn’t worked out too badly for the Raptors or the Blue Jays, after all.


Add a few more unexpected pages to the knotted, never-less-than-captivating story of Hope Solo’s professional soccer career. 
Solo, the former U.S. Women’s National Team (USWNT) goalkeeper, announced on her Facebook page on Friday morning that she will run for President of U.S. Soccer.
Solo wrote: “What we have lost in America is belief in our system, in our coaches, in our talent pool, and in the governance of US Soccer. We now must refocus our goals and come together as a soccer community to bring about the changes we desire.”
She continued to spell out a four-point manifesto including a “Push for Equal Pay” for the USWNT and, “all women in the USSF [United States Soccer Federation] workplace”.

The 36-year-old’s entry marks another intriguing moment in an election race being contested between perceived U.S. Soccer insiders and renegade candidates. Sunil Gulati, the incumbent, faces a challenge to his 12-year presidency from current U.S. Soccer Executive Vice-President Carlos Cordeiro, Boston-based lawyer Steven H. Gans, and Fox Sports analyst and former U.S. Men's National Team (USMNT) striker Eric Wynalda.
Solo, though, may have the greatest potential to shake up the outcome of February’s election.
After a college career with the Washington Huskies she won 202 caps for the USWNT from 2000 to 2016. But her career was rarely as simple as her appearance record and longevity made out.
“For more than a decade, she loomed menacingly between the posts, a muscular, hyper-focused, lightning-quick goalkeeper who seemed able to stop anything. But in the end, the one thing Hope Solo couldn’t stop was herself”, Jonathan Mahler wrote in the  New York Times in August 2016, after Solo had been suspended by U.S. Soccer for six months for calling the Sweden team that knocked the USWNT out of the Rio Olympics a “bunch of cowards.”

That apparently spelled the end of the Richland, Washington native’s international career—one marked, as the  NYT noted, by feuds with teammates and governing bodies as well as by fabulous competitiveness and athleticism.
Off the field, Solo was arrested on domestic violence charges in June 2014. The charges were subsequently dropped then reinstated, and the case is apparently still open, Deadspin reports. She also accused the former Fifa president of inappropriate behavior, telling a Portuguese magazine in November that she "had Sepp Blatter grab my ass” at an awards presentation in 2013. Blatter denies the accusation. 
Now, perhaps, comes the most extraordinary chapter of all. U.S. Soccer’s  enfant terrible wants to become its most crucial power-broker. And if the history of Solo’s career is anything to go by, she may yet succeed.


LiAngelo and LaMelo Ball may yet join their older brother Lonzo in the NBA. It just won’t be by the traditional route.
LaVar, the boys’ father, told  ESPN on Thursday that LiAngelo and LaMelo will move abroad, forgoing the chance to play college basketball. LiAngelo withdrew from UCLA earlier this week without having played a regular season game for the Bruins.
"I don't care about the money," LaVar said. "I want them to go somewhere where they will play them together on the court at the same time. The priority is for the boys to play on the same team."
The 19-year-old LiAngelo became embroiled in a diplomatic flashpoint in November when he admitted shoplifting in Hangzhou, China—an incident that resulted in the intervention of President Donald Trump. Trump’s disputed role in getting LiAngelo and two teammates released back to the U.S. led to a Twitter row with the equally pugnacious LaVar.
LiAngelo was suspended indefinitely by UCLA, but that punishment now appears irrelevant after he left the school.
LiAngelo and LaMelo have agreed a deal to be represented by Harrison Gaines, who is also Lonzo’s agent. LaVar said there were a “few teams interested” overseas in signing the boys. His original plan was for LaMelo, 16, to follow LiAngelo and Lonzo to UCLA.

LaVar’s plan sounds typically grandiose but it is also fraught with potential embarrassment. A  Yahoo Sports  article Wednesday revealed that a representative of the Ball family had approached Lietkabelis of the Lithuanian Basketball League about signing up LiAngelo. Arturs Stalbergs, the Lietkabelis coach, tweeted, “We have an opening at the security staff since they have an experience in this field.” (The tweet has since been deleted).
LaMelo is generally considered more talented, and a better NBA prospect, than LiAngelo. Neither brother, though, will be treading Lonzo’s route from the Bruins to the draft to the NBA.
It’s just the latest chapter in the wild ride that is following the fortunes of the Ball family.


Third in the NFC North, probably needing to win out and with a bunch of teams to jump over even if they do that, the playoffs look a long way off right now for the Green Bay Packers.
But when you’ve got No 12 on your team, there’s always a chance.
Aaron Rodgers, the NFL’s best quarterback—including Tom Brady—broke his collarbone against the Vikings on October 15. The Packers put the two-time M.V.P. on injured reserve, ensuring he can’t return before Week 15 against the Panthers.
In Rodgers’s absence, Mike McCarthy’s team has lost four of its past six games with Brett Hundley under center. An overtime win over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers at Lambeau Field on Sunday probably kept Green Bay’s dim playoff hopes alive.
Rodgers practised again for the first time on Wednesday, and received glowing reviews from Hundley and his Pro Bowl wide receiver Jordy Nelson.
"He throws the ball unlike any I've ever seen," Hundley told  ESPN. "Still slinging it."
Nelson was even more succinct. "He looks like himself," Nelson said.
Nelson and the Packers’ other top wideouts have struggled with Hundley throwing to them. The 24-year-old U.C.L.A. product threw 22 times against the Buccaneers for 13 completions and zero touchdowns. The Packers relied on a bruising ground game instead, with Jamaal Williams rushing 21 times for 113 yards.
Davante Adams was alone among the Packers’ receiving corps in prospering against Tampa Bay, catching four passes for 42 yards. But despite his relative success with Hundley, Adams has given the pithiest explanation in a long time for Rodgers’s brilliance.
Writing in  The Players’ Tribune on Wednesday, Adams tells a story from his rookie season in 2014. It starts off in a pretty standard way—“The adjustment from college to the NFL was no joke," Adams writes. "Everything’s just a lot  more in the NFL—more physical, more fast, more strong.”—but then goes on to describe the brutal mental process that constitutes learning your trade as a receiver under Rodgers.
“It was Oct. 2, 2014, my fifth game as a Packer," he writes. "We were playing the Vikings at Lambeau. Aaron called a play, and I knew—man, I just  knew—that I wasn’t getting the ball.”

The play broke down, and Rodgers cycled through his progressions and looked for Adams. Being a rookie, Adams hadn’t run his route properly.
“After the play, Aaron looked over at our offensive coordinator and pointed at me,” Adams recalls. “He made a yanking motion with his arm—like,  Take this dude off the field. I spent the next eight plays on the sidelines.”
It’s this kind of ruthlessness that makes Rodgers a future Hall of Famer. The Packers can’t get him back soon enough.


Canadian telecoms company Rogers Communications Inc is considering selling the Toronto Blue Jays Major League Baseball team in an effort to generate cash that could be used in its core business, the company’s chief financial officer said.
The Blue Jays were ranked by Forbes as the 16th-most valuable MLB team this year out of 30, worth $1.3 billion.
Rogers should be able to sell it for about that sum, said Andrew Zimbalist, a sports economist with Smith College in Northampton, Massachusetts, who noted the team is in a large, wealthy city with a strong fan base.
The Blue Jays were founded in 1977 and became back-to-back World Series champions in 1992 and 1993.
Rogers, which operates cable TV and telecom services in Canada, bought 80 percent of the Blue Jays in 2000 and the remaining 20 percent in 2004, as part of a strategy to obtain broadcasting rights for what is Canada’s only remaining MLB team.
The company, which has about $13 billion in outstanding debt, now figures it could make more sense to sell the team and license broadcast rights from a new owner, Rogers CFO Tony Staffieri told a UBS investor conference in New York on Tuesday.
“We can get the exclusive content through renting it,” Staffieri said, according to a transcript from the event, adding that the company would “like to get the content without necessarily having the capital tied up on our balance sheet” but that no deal is imminent.

He pointed to a C$5.2 billion ($4.1 billion) 12-year deal that Rogers signed in 2013 to broadcast National Hockey League games, elbowing out rival BCE Inc for rights to Canada’s most popular sport.
A spokeswoman for Rogers, Sarah Schmidt, said on Wednesday that the company “would like to surface value and get credit” for its “terrific sports assets.”
Staffieri did not say if Rogers is considering divesting a stake in the more popular Maple Leafs National Hockey League franchise that it obtained alongside BCE in 2011 for a combined C$1.32 billion.The league in September approved the $1.2 billion sale of the Miami Marlins, according to Forbes. A record $2 billion was paid for the Los Angeles Dodgers in 2012.
Rogers Communications, which is controlled by Canada’s prominent Rogers family, is also looking to sell a C$1.5 billion ($1.2 billion) stake in Cogeco Inc and its subsidiary, a cable TV company with operations across the United States and Canada.


Dallas quarterback Dak Prescott shook off a first-half hand injury as he and running back Alfred Morris powered the Cowboys to a 38-14 victory over the Washington Redskins at AT&T Stadium on Thursday.
Prescott passed for 102 yards and two touchdowns, including a 13-yard scoring pass to Dez Bryant early in the fourth quarter that gave Dallas a 17-point advantage.
Morris rushed for 126 yards and a touchdown, all but 38 yards coming in the second half.
He successfully moved the chains for Dallas (6-6), which had lacked a consistent running game since Ezekiel Elliott began serving a six-game suspension for violating the NFL’s personal-conduct policy four games ago.
Washington quarterback Kirk Cousins completed 26-of-37 passes for 251 yards and two touchdowns. However, he was intercepted twice and fumbled once, part of the Redskins (5-7) losing the turnover battle, 4-0.
Morris ran one yard for a touchdown with 4:55 left in the fourth quarter, sealing the win for Dallas. Cowboys running back Rod Smith added a one-yard scoring run with 2:37 left.
Prescott went to the locker room during the second quarter to have a hand injury examined, but he returned to the game by the end of the first half.
The Cowboys scored the game’s first 17 points and held a 17-7 lead at halftime.
The Dallas defense and special teams created a pair of turnovers in the first quarter, but the Cowboys’ offense failed to take advantage of either one.
The Cowboys finally gained their initial first down on the final play of the first quarter. Prescott scrambled away from pressure and then ran 13 yards to convert a third-and-five from the Dallas 46.
Prescott then capped the 11-play, 59-yard scoring march when he hit tight end Jason Witten with an eight-yard touchdown pass to put Dallas 7-0 up with 10:43 left in the second quarter.

Dallas eventually converted a turnover into points when DeMarcus Lawrence sacked Cousins, separating the Washington quarterback from the ball. Maliek Collins recovered for the Cowboys at the Redskins 19-yard line.
Dallas’ third takeaway of the first half set up a Dan Bailey field goal from 24 yards that put the Cowboys ahead 10-0.
Ryan Switzer put the exclamation point on an eventful first half for the Dallas special teams units when he returned a punt 83 yards for a score.
Switzer’s touchdown put the Cowboys in front 17-0 with 3:46 left in the second quarter.
Washington answered before halftime as Cousins led a nine-play, 75-yard touchdown drive. Cousins hit wide receiver Ryan Grant with a 20-yard pass for the score with just over a minute remaining before halftime.


Updated | The United States embassy in London conducted a Twitter Question and Answer session with Ambassador Woody Johnson on Tuesday, inviting users to send in queries to be answered via Periscope.
As is sometimes—nay often—the way of these things when major institutions canvass Twitter with innocent intentions, it didn’t end well.
#AskWoody coincided with President Donald Trump retweeting posts from Britain First, the far-right anti-Muslim organization, provoking worldwide outrage. And that became the focus of the questioning of Ambassador Johnson. “OK everybody—let's #AskWoody whether he approves of a US President retweeting and legitimising a far-Right hate group which murdered a British MP”,  The Guardian’s  film critic Peter Bradshaw wrote on Wednesday. (Thomas Mair, convicted of the murder of MP Jo Cox in November 2016, shouted “Britain first” during the attack, a British court was told last year).
 
OK everybody — let&#39;s #AskWoody whether he approves of a US President retweeting and legitimising a far-Right hate group which murdered a British MP https://t.co/Dss1uXq2L0
 

“Apparently the US ambassador to the UK wants our questions about the US-UK relationship. I'd like to #AskWoody why his President is promoting fascism in this country,” wrote Patrick Harvie, a Green MSP (Member of the Scottish Parliament).
Other questions were more general in nature but no less difficult to answer. “Simple question. What the hell happened? America used to be a shining city on a hill. You have moral authority no longer,” one user asked, perhaps rhetorically.
 
Simple question. What the hell happened? America used to be a shining city on a hill. You have moral authority no longer. #AskWoody
 

Johnson, who was confirmed as U.S. Ambassador in London by the Senate in August, tweeted out an apparent response to the vociferous tone of the questioning on Thursday. “I wanted you to #AskWoody,” he wrote. “Thank you for your questions and feedback. I have relayed your concerns to Washington. The U.S. & UK have a long history of speaking frankly with each other, as all close friends do. Our relationship is strong, vital and enduring.”
As the owner of the New York Jets, one wonders whether Johnson mightn’t rather watch his team try to improve on a 4-7 record in 2017 against the Kansas City Chiefs on Sunday than answer questions related to the president’s Twitter conduct. The Jets winning a football game seems more likely right now than the storm around Trump’s retweets dying down.
The U.S. embassy in London told Newsweek: “The embassy often engages with the public via social media platforms. When Ambassador Johnson was running the New York Jets, he found it very valuable to get to know the fans by walking around the stadium on game day and this is the digital equivalent. Ambassador Johnson looks forward to answering some questions next week on December 5.”
This story has been updated with a statement from the U.S. embassy.


Some Cleveland Cavaliers didn’t want Dwyane Wade on the team this season, when the veteran shooting guard and future Hall of Famer made the jump from the listless Bulls to join his old buddy LeBron James in Cleveland.
James revealed that snippet in an interview with  The Athletic published Thursday evening. Richard Jefferson, a popular member of the Cavaliers’ roster, was traded to the Atlanta Hawks to make room for Wade. (Jefferson was subsequently waived by the Hawks and signed with the Denver Nuggets). That apparently upset certain members of the Cavaliers’ locker room, which rankled with James.
“I still know what he’s [Wade] capable of doing,” James told  The Athletic. “Why wouldn’t you want another guy in the locker room that brings a championship mentality and a guy who can still play? So, of course, it bothered me, but (expletive) it. It is what it is.”
Not for the first time and almost certainly not the last, James appears to have been right. Wade dropped 19 points on Thursday night as the Cavaliers saw off the awful Hawks at Philips Arena. James scored 24 with 12 assists and six rebounds, while Kevin Love led the team with 25 points. Love added 16 rebounds as the Cavaliers took their eighth straight, the NBA’s longest current winning streak despite having trailed 67-58 toward the end of the first half.
Wade isn’t the same player James dovetailed so beautifully with in Miami, but he’s playing a vital role from the Cavaliers’ bench. He has started just three games out of 20 for 23.5 minutes per night and 10.8 points per game, which would both be career lows were they extrapolated over the whole season.

It’s possible that some of the Cavaliers’ discomfort with Wade’s one-year deal has quietened since he moved to the Cavaliers’ second unit, after beginning the season as a starter.  ESPN’s Bryan Windhorst reported “angst” in the locker room in October after Wade’s signing shifted J.R. Smith to the bench.
There’s nothing like winning to silence dissenting voices, though. Wade is key to the Cavaliers’ efforts as relief for James and that has Tyronn Lue’s team gaining on the Celtics in the Eastern Conference standings. For now, at least, all seems well in northeast Ohio.


President Donald Trump’s frequent golf trips have cost the Secret Service close to $150,000 in golf cart rentals to protect him. Federal purchase orders obtained and reported by USA Today on Wednesday revealed that the Secret Service has spent at least $144,975 to rent golf carts since Trump took office, including $7,470 for outings during his stay at his private Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida over Thanksgiving.
The Secret Service is tasked with protecting the president, and the law prohibits Trump from paying for or providing equipment or services in order to prevent potential conflicts of interest for the agency.
Trump’s Thanksgiving golf trips around Palm Beach increased a contract that the Secret Service has with Florida-based Golf Cart & Utility Distributors to $69,430. The contract, signed in September and effective through May 2018, is the largest purchase order the Secret Service has made since the beginning of Trump’s tenure.
The president’s recurring visits to his private clubs and his big family size have stretched the Secret Service’s resources. By August, the agency could not afford overtime for hundreds of employees and more than 1,000 agents hit federally mandated salary caps and overtime allowances for the year.
In light of the Secret Service’s financial shortcomings, critics have called on Trump to cut down on his trips and vacations and stay in the White House.
"There's a question about how fast Trump is racking up bills that the taxpayers have to pay, which are largely trips to his hotels and his golf courses," Harrell Kirstein, a spokeswoman for progressive PAC American Bridge, told USA Today. “Instead of wasting so much time and money on his vacation, he should do his job."
But Trump has repeatedly said that his trips to the “Winter White House,” as he calls Mar-a-Lago, and to golf courses he owns in Bedminster, New Jersey, and Sterling, Virginia, are productive.
“Will be having meetings and working the phones from the Winter White House in Florida (Mar-a-Lago),” Trump tweeted the morning before Thanksgiving.

Since he was inaugurated, Trump has spent 103 days at properties he owns, including 81 days at four of his golf courses, according to an NBC News tracker.
The Secret Service reportedly paid Mar-a-Lago more than $63,000 over a few months for hotel costs ranging from $1,300 to $11,050.
Richard Painter, who was White House ethics lawyer under former President George W. Bush, told CNN that Trump risks violating the domestic emoluments clause if his company is profiting off the agency and that “Mar-a-Lago should either charge Secret Service a rate federal employees are authorized to pay for a hotel room under ordinary circumstances or not charge at all."


Eli Manning won’t be under center on Sunday when the putrid 2017 version of the New York Giants travels to California to play the underwhelming 2017 version of the Oakland Raiders. With the 2-9 Giants listing like some huge, rusty tanker toward the end of the regular season, head coach Ben McAdoo will give Geno Smith and Davis Webb the chance to go to work without Odell Beckham Jr. or Brandon Marshall.
Manning cried at his locker on Tuesday, in as good a physical metaphor for the Giants’ season as you will find. At least, unlike McAdoo (perhaps), he remains popular with at least one New Yorker. The Associated Press, via  The Morning Call, reported that Manning received one write-in vote for New York City mayor.

It wasn’t enough to beat Bill de Blasio, the incumbent, who was re-elected with 713,634 votes on the Democratic line and 46,478 on the Working Families line. Heck, it wasn’t even enough to beat several other random write-in characters from the New York City sports scene. Former Yankees Joe Girardi and Derek Jeter got two votes each,  AP reported. The Knicks’ Kristaps Porzingis got nine, plus two people who tried to vote for him and spelled his name wrong. Aaron Judge, the reigning American League rookie of the year, received 10 write-in ballots.
Manning won’t be getting a political career he never asked for any time soon, then. But the two-time Super Bowl winner remains an immensely popular figure in New York City and New Jersey. It’s probably not too much of a risk or stretch to suggest Manning is more popular than the 2017 Giants. A group of Giants fans have paid for three billboards around MetLife Stadium, according to the  New York Post, emblazoned with, “Big Blue Shame On You.” Manning, meanwhile, was practicing with the Giants’ scout team on Wednesday,  Yahoo Sports reported.
Anyone predicting that the Giants might finish the 2017 season with one more win than their quarterback received votes for New York City mayor would have been labelled as interesting, at least. But here we are at the end of November and that is actually a realistic proposition. Life is strange.


The Washington Redskins travel to Dallas on Thursday night to play the Cowboys in the latest instalment of probably the NFL’s most bitter and storied rivalry, accusations of hyperbole mulled over and quite possibly accepted.
Millions will watch because, well, it’s football, on a Thursday night that often produces terrible football but that still gets ratings—because no matter how bad the NFL gets as an on-field product, it has that McDonald’s thing where people just don’t seem to care. Or not in big enough numbers to deny Roger Goodell a contract extension, anyway. They will watch because the Cowboys are like a magnet that picks up schadenfreude instead of iron filings, and the Redskins aren’t significantly less morbidly interesting.
They shouldn’t watch. The Redskins at the Cowboys still matters tremendously to fans of both teams, of course, in the context of two games per season. But in terms of the NFL in 2017, this matchup could hardly matter less for all the good, interesting stuff to come in January. Neither team is terrible, exactly. Until the ‘Boys lost Ezekiel Elliott to his much-delayed suspension, they looked good for a Wild Card in the NFC. The Redskins have actually done okay with a nasty schedule—the seventh-hardest in the NFL this season. They have a franchise quarterback still making plays even though he’s been sacked 31 times through 11 games, according to The Washington Post. They’ve beaten all of the teams they should have beaten and lost to everyone stronger than them, including a Cowboys team that was still pounding the rock via Elliott in Week 8. They even own a couple of really impressive wins over the Rams and the Seahawks.

But they’re still the definition of mediocrity, as are the Cowboys without Elliott and Sean Lee and with Dak Prescott throwing picks and looking more like a rookie quarterback than he did in his rookie season. The Cowboys and Redskins, with significant help from the Giants, are doing their best to make the NFC East the worst division in football in 2017. Only the magnificent Eagles, with M.V.P. candidate Carson Wentz at the controls, lift it above the weird AFC West. And at least that division still has three potential winners. And sure, these things are cyclical, but look at the NFC South. That division is currently filling three of four Wild Card spots.
The Cowboys and Redskins don’t suck but they are drifting towards the end of the season and for two such storied franchises and such a major rivalry, that’s kind of sad. The Eagles are going to win the NFC East. The Cowboys and Redskins aren’t going to the playoffs. If you want to watch it, the game is on NBC from 8.25 p.m. E.T. and it's streamable via Fubo.tv. But be prepared for a strangely hollow experience.


Admittedly there is some stiff competition around in the NBA this year. But on nights like Wednesday it’s hard to argue against Kyle Lowry and DeMar DeRozan as the most dynamic and entertaining backcourt duo of them all.
Lowry and DeRozan combined for 66 points in the Toronto Raptors’ 126-113 win over the Charlotte Hornets at Air Canada Centre—a game that was closer than it had any right to be after the Raptors dozed off at the start of the second half, drawing the ire of head coach Dwane Casey. “We’ve got to fix it [Toronto’s slow start to third quarters],” Casey told the  Toronto Star. “We talked about it. Other than start five other people, I don’t know what to do.”
A team with lesser individual talents than Lowry and DeRozan might have let the Hornets take over and win the game. But the point guard made eight of 11 three-pointers in a 36-point night and DeRozan scored 30 and added four rebounds and six assists. Lowry continued to rebound impressively, especially for a six-foot-one guard, with five, as the Raptors closed the game out to move to 13-7.
In a comprehensive piece listing the NBA’s best backcourts before the 2017 season began,  Bleacher Report put the Raptors’ duo fourth best with the following caveat. “Maybe DeRozan will finally become a deft three-point shooter,” Adam Fromal wrote. “Maybe he won't keep pounding the air out of the rock while trying to set himself up for a mid-range jumper.” Well, DeRozan is still an elite scorer and bad from three-point range. He only tried two of them against the Hornets and missed both.
But when Lowry can do it, and when he’s sinking threes himself, it doesn’t really matter—DeRozan can slash and drive to the basket to his heart’s content. The Raptors’ Twitter account certainly seemed pleased with this beautiful Lowry three-pointer, hit as time expired at the end of the second quarter.


Can Lowry and DeRozan finally drag Toronto to some tangible playoff success? It’s too early to say. But night after regular-season night, they provide a ton of entertainment for the neutral.


The NFL proposed joining with players in a bid to spur social justice change, but not everyone is on board.
The league submitted the final draft of the proposal to players on Monday that would contribute nearly $100 million to causes considered important to African-American communities.
The NFL is seeking an agreement that players will stand for the anthem in return and put an end to the controversial movement that former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick began last season.
Players are expected to discuss the proposal during a scheduled conference call Wednesday night. If they accept the league’s proposal, then the owners would vote to complete the deal at the annual league meetings in March, according to ESPN.
National funding as part of the league’s current plan would offer 25 percent to the United Negro College Fund and another 25 percent to Dream Corps. The Players Coalition, which has filed for paperwork for nonprofit status, would get the remaining 50 percent.
Two players already have expressed concerns about the proposal and plan to part from the Players Coalition, a group of approximately 40 players. Philadelphia Eagles safety Malcolm Jenkins and former NFL wide receiver Anquan Boldin are viewed as the leaders of the Players Coalition.

San Francisco safety Eric Reid and Miami Dolphins safety Michael Thomas said they are withdrawing by releasing the same statement on Wednesday.
“With much thought and consideration, I’ve decided to officially withdraw my involvement in The Players Coalition founded by Malcolm Jenkins and Anquan Boldin,” the statement read.
”The Players Coalition was supposed to be formed as a group that represents NFL athletes who have been silently protesting social injustices and racism. However, Malcolm and Anquan can no longer speak on our behalf as we don’t believe the coalition’s beliefs are in our best interests as a whole.
“We will continue to have dialogue with the league to find equitable solutions but without Malcolm and Anquan as our representative.”
Reid was the first player to kneel beside Kaepernick last season during the latter’s demonstration to shine a light on police brutality and social injustice.
Kaepernick opted out of his deal with the 49ers in the spring and has remained unsigned with some believing he is being blackballed from the league. Kaepernick filed a grievance against the NFL in October accusing teams of collusion.


The College Football Playoff Selection Committee made the only decision available to it on Tuesday night, leaving Alabama looking from the outside in at the top four ahead of the final weekend of the regular season.
The Crimson Tide went on the road to Auburn with a perfect record, and a place in the SEC Championship Game against Georgia on the line. Both vanished at Jordan-Hare Stadium. And the Selection Committee reacted, dropping Nick Saban’s team to fifth in its fifth, and penultimate, rankings for the season. Auburn jumped from fourth to second courtesy of that 26-14 win, while Clemson moved into first place. Oklahoma shifted up from fourth to third. Miami’s bad loss at Pittsburgh sent it tumbling from second to seventh.
The Hurricanes, though, control their own destiny. Beat Clemson in the ACC Championship Game and Miami is almost certainly in the playoffs (and the loser of that is out). The Sooners will be in if they beat TCU for a second time this season in the Big 12 title game at AT&T Stadium.
Neither of those results, whichever way they fall, really help the Tide although the Committee will face some weirdness if Oklahoma loses against TCU. There is hope, though, for Saban in the other two Championship games. “As the Tide spend SEC championship Saturday at home for the first time since 2013, they will be forced to root for their most hated rival: the Auburn Tigers,” Adam Rittenberg wrote for  ESPN on Wednesday morning. If that sounds odd then Rittenberg’s logic is simple enough to understand. If Auburn walks off with the SEC Championship then the Tide’s one loss looks much stronger than if Georgia beats the team Alabama lost to one week previously.
That on its own won’t be enough, of course, because of Wisconsin sitting at nNo. 4 in the Selection Committee’s latest rankings. The Badgers’ soft schedule can be quibbled with but an unbeaten season and a Big 12 title will get them in—possibly as the third seed for a Rose Bowl game against Oklahoma, according to  Buckys5thquarter, the Badgers blog.
If Ohio State beats Wisconsin to win the Big Ten, though? Then  ESPN, for one, thinks the Selection Committee could turn back to the Tide because of the Buckeyes’ blowout at the hands of Iowa on November 4. “If it comes down to Ohio State vs. Alabama for the final spot, the Buckeyes might need a 2014-like smashing of Wisconsin in Indianapolis, plus a Georgia win over Auburn, to get the nod over Nick Saban's team,” Rittenberg writes.
So Alabama needs Auburn to keep Georgia from winning the SEC, and Ohio State to knock Wisconsin out, and  then the Selection Committee might have to consider Saban’s one-loss team (and a ‘good’ loss at that, compared to Ohio State’s Iowa shock). This weekend promises to be interesting indeed, even without Alabama playing.


Eli Manning will not start for the New York Giants on Sunday on the road against the Oakland Raiders, ending the NFL’s longest current ironman streak for a quarterback.
In the process of benching Manning, the Giants will end a far more durable and dubious record. In place of the 36-year-old under center in the hostile Oakland Alameda Coliseum will be Geno Smith, a former second-round pick of the New York Jets. When Smith takes the first snap he will become the first black starting quarterback in the Giants’ 92-year history.
All 31 other NFL franchises have started a black quarterback in the 49 years since Marlin Briscoe first played the position for the Denver Broncos. The New York Times reported that Smith is also the first quarterback to start for both the Giants and Jets.
Just how long Smith will hold the starter’s job is another question. “Over the last five games, we will take a look at Geno, and we will also give Davis [Webb] an opportunity,” head coach Ben McAdoo told the Giants’ official website. The franchise, which has crawled to a 2-9 record this season and lies rock bottom of the NFC East, selected Webb with the 87th overall pick of the 2017 NFL Draft. Smith, who spent three years with the Jets from 2013 to 2016, started all 16 regular-season games as a rookie but threw 21 interceptions to go along with 12 touchdowns.

Without Manning’s say-so, the Giants might not have decided to move on quite yet from starting their veteran signal-caller, who has collected two Super Bowl rings and a reputation for clutch play rather than the dominant statistics of his peers.
“Coach McAdoo told me I could continue to start while Geno and Davis are given an opportunity to play,” Manning said. “My feeling is that if you are going to play the other guys, play them. Starting just to keep the streak going and knowing you won’t finish the game and have a chance to win it is pointless to me, and it tarnishes the streak. Like I always have, I will be ready to play if and when I am needed. I will help Geno and Davis prepare to play as well as they possibly can.”
Smith will have to work without two starting wide receivers. All-Pros Odell Beckham Jr. and Brandon Marshall are both out with injuries. The Giants' website appeared to be trying to soften the blow of Manning’s demotion when it wrote, “Manning has been throwing to an inexperienced group of wideouts that includes Roger Lewis, Jr., Tavarres King, Travis Rudolph, plus rookie tight end Evan Engram.” Smith cannot hope to ever compete with Manning’s streak of starts. But he will write his name in the annals of the NFL on Sunday.


Former world number one Serena Williams has yet to make a decision about her participation at the Australian Open, while world number 12 Svetlana Kuznetsova is also a doubt for the first grand slam of 2018 after undergoing wrist surgery.
Williams was around two months pregnant when she captured her 23rd grand slam singles title in Melbourne earlier this year and was hoping to defend her crown next January following the birth of her daughter in September.
”Serena is getting ready for 2018,“ the 36-year-old American’s coach Patrick Mouratoglou told CNN. ”She is practicing and getting back in shape. I will be joining her soon in Florida.
“We will see how her body is reacting and how her tennis level is and we will take a decision regarding Australia.”
Russian Kuznetsova told local media that she was recovering from wrist surgery conducted earlier this month after separate injuries to the area and said there was no specific time frame for her return.
“I had two injuries in my wrist, so I had to do the operation,” the 32-year-old double major winner said.
“There’s a very complicated diagnosis. I‘m still recovering and the doctor does not talk about specific dates when I can start training and play. Australia, most likely, I will have to miss.”
Meanwhile, Victoria Azarenka, who has not played since July due to an ongoing child custody battle, is set to return at the ASB Classic in January but will be without coach Michael Joyce, who released a statement on their partnership.
“Vika is an extremely talented player. While I am excited to see her return to tennis, I encourage and respect her decision to put her family first,” Joyce said of the Belarusian two-time Australian Open champion and former world number one.
“It is with deep regret that I have decided to move forward with my coaching career while she continues to work out her private life. I look forward to seeing her on the tour soon and wish her the best of luck.”
The Australian Open will be held from January 15-28.


In a 15-year professional playing career in the NBA, LeBron James had never been ejected from a game.
That changed on Wednesday night at Quicken Loans Arena, in game 1,082 of James’s professional career. With the Cavaliers leading the Heat 93-70, James missed a layup over Heat forward James Johnson. He argued with referee Kane Fitzgerald, who assessed him a technical foul and chucked him from the game.
It didn’t matter, at least in terms of the result. James was tossed with one minute and 59 seconds remaining in the third quarter; the Cavaliers still won 108-97 to pull within 3.5 games of the Celtics for the Eastern Conference lead. Despite his truncated game, James still managed 21 points, 12 rebounds, six assists, five steals and a block in 28 minutes of play.
"I got fouled all the way up the court, from the time that I stripped him [Johnson], all the way until I got to the rim," James said of the ejection in quotes reported by  ESPN. "I said what I had to say and then I moved on, but he decided I should get [ejected]. It is what it is. We got the win, and that's what's most important."
Fitzgerald claimed James had thrown an “air punch” and used “vulgarity” against him as reasons for tossing the future Hall of Famer from the game. "It was a culmination of a couple different acts," Fitzgerald told ESPN pool reporter Dave McMenamin, as reported by the  league office. "Immediately after the no call, he turned and threw an air punch directly at me and then he aggressively charged at me and then he used vulgarity in my ear a few times."
James had a broader complaint after the game about how he is being officiated this season. "I think I'm one of the league leaders in points in the paint,” James told  Cleveland.com. “I drive just as much as anybody. At this point, it's almost like they're trying to turn me into a jump shooter. I can't be a jump shooter.” James attempted only one free throw against the Heat.
Dwyane Wade, James’s teammate during their days with the Heat and now playing a key role from the bench for the Cavaliers, said Fitzgerald should have given James the “benefit of the doubt.”
There was one person, though, who agreed unequivocally with the official. "Yup. Should have got thrown out. Yup," Tyronn Lue told Cleveland.com when asked about the decision. Was Fitzgerald right? Watch the video below and decide for yourself.

Eli Manning helped the New York Giants win two Super Bowls, but when faced with a losing record of 2-9, Coach Ben McAdoo announced on Tuesday Manning would be benched. Instead, Geno Smith is slated to start against the Oakland Raiders. Rookie Davis Webb will play, too.
“Geno will start this week," McAdoo said. “Over the last five games, we will take a look at Geno, and we will also give Davis an opportunity.”
Is this how the Eli Manning era ends? Getting benched for Geno Smith. pic.twitter.com/UMGhzghSEV
Twitter users were generally outraged over McAdoo’s decision, which ended Manning’s streak of starting 210 consecutive games in NFL. He’s behind Brett Favre, who started 297 regular season games.
Ben McAdoo: Geno Smith will start this week.Eli Manning: you high? pic.twitter.com/zEFKlrUegR
Manning apparently chose not to start against the Raiders.
“My feeling is that if you are going to play the other guys, play them,” Manning said. “Starting just to keep the streak going and knowing you won't finish the game and have a chance to win it is pointless to me, and it tarnishes the streak. Like I always have, I will be ready to play if and when I am needed. I will help Geno and Davis prepare to play as well as they possibly can.”
Despite his benching, Eli Manning will always have a special place in our hearts.Our 404 error page:https://t.co/S6EmwEpClT pic.twitter.com/tIlDIpSyCV
Soon after the news broke, memes of Manning’s face when he heard the news started to go viral.
Injuries have plagued the beleaguered Giants, with star wide receivers Odell Beckham, Jr. and Brandon Marshall being out for most of the season.
Eli Manning has been BENCHED! pic.twitter.com/GdI5ZuurU8
Ultimately, McAdoo said replacing Manning was a last ditch effort to try to get a win.
“This is not the way it should be, but unfortunately, it’s where we are,” McAdoo said. “Our number one priority every week is to go win a game, but we owe it to the organization to get an evaluation of everybody on the roster, and that includes at the quarterback position. I’ll say it again, I have the utmost respect for Eli and everything he has done for this organization throughout his career. He is the consummate professional. He doesn’t like the position we are in, and neither do any of us. Eli has had to deal with a lot this season. Through it all, he has done everything we have asked of him in getting that unit ready to play. He has been steady, just like he has always been.”

Tiger Woods returns to professional golf on Thursday at the Hero World Challenge in Albany, The Bahamas, hoping to prove he is over the injury problems that have derailed a Hall of Fame career.
Woods, 41, has not played a round of professional golf since February when he felt back spasms at the Dubai Desert Classic. In between times, the former world number one and winner of 14 major championships entered rehab for an addiction to prescription drugs.
Now Woods is on the comeback trail once again, at the invitational tournament he hosts, albeit with tempered expectations. "I'm excited about coming back again," Woods said on Tuesday in quotes reported by  USA Today. "My expectations have been tempered a little bit just because I’ve been away from the game for two years."
Woods made an attempt at returning in the Bahamas last December, and briefly raised hopes that he had conquered the problems that have stopped him encroaching any further on Jack Nicklaus’s Major record.
How do the bookmakers see Woods’s return going? It’s no surprise to find him at long odds, given the strength of a field containing eight of the world’s top ten players.  Paddy Power, the Irish betting company, gives Woods the third-longest odds of all 18 players in the tournament. Woods is 30-1, ahead of Charley Hoffman and Kevin Chappell.
CBS ’s  SportsLine  tool gives Woods an even more remote chance of taking home the $3,500,000 winner’s prize. After simulating the event 10,000 times,  SportsLine puts Woods bottom of the field at 45-1. Justin Thomas, the world number three, Jordan Spieth and world number one Dustin Johnson are priced at 6-1.
Thomas, Spieth and Johnson—in that order—are given the shortest odds by  Oddschecker.com. Woods is +3,300 along with Charley Hoffman and Kevin Chappell. There will be many golf fans—and Woods devotees—who will bet in hope more than expectation. But it’s unlikely to lead to many rewards this weekend.


Perhaps, this time around, a Tiger Woods comeback really will stick.
On Thursday, Woods takes to a professional golf course in competition for the first time since February. He will play as part of an 18-man field at the Hero World Challenge in Albany in the Bahamas, a tournament that he hosts. It was here in December 2016 that Woods shot a sparkling 7-under-par 65 in the second round to raise hopes that this return might be a lasting one.
But the year since then has been difficult. Woods withdrew from the Dubai Desert Classic in February before the second round, with what his manager, Mark Steinberg, described as “back spasms.” Woods missed the Masters in March and had back surgery in April. Then, on May 29, he was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence near his home in Jupiter Island, Florida.
Woods checked into rehab in June to treat an addiction to prescription painkillers. He announced his return on his personal website on October 30. "I am excited to return to competitive golf at the Hero World Challenge," Woods wrote at the time. "Albany is the perfect setting and it will be great to join this outstanding field.”

The Hero World Challenge suits Woods’s comeback as a tournament with an elite level of competition but no cut. The 41-year-old will line up alongside many of golf’s luminaries, including the top three players in the world: Dustin Johnson, Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas. Hideki Matsuyama, fifth in the world, Justin Rose (sixth) and Rickie Fowler (ninth) will also be present.
Woods’s latest attempt at a prolonged return to professional golf is available on television via the Golf Channel and NBC. The Golf Channel has coverage from 1:20 p.m. ET to 4:30 p.m. ET on Thursday and Friday. On Saturday, the Golf Channel will show coverage from 12 p.m. ET until 2:30 p.m. ET, with NBC taking over until 5 p.m. On Sunday, everything shifts an hour earlier: The Golf Channel will broadcast from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. ET, with NBC picking up the coverage from 1 p.m. to 5 p.m. ET. Those wishing to stream the event can do so via a subscription to FuboTV.


How badly the Los Angeles Clippers will rue the scrum that injured the left knee of their All-Star forward Blake Griffin on Monday night at Staples Center will only become clear with time.
With four minutes to go in a tight contest against the Lakers, Austin Rivers fell on Griffin’s left leg, according to  NBA.com. The limb bent “awkwardly,” and Griffin left the game. The Clippers will find out the extent of the injury after tests on Tuesday.
At least for one night, though, the Clippers found scoring from other areas and personnel, which may bode well if they are to lose Griffin for any length of time. While Griffin put up 26 points, 11 rebounds and six assists, veteran shooting guard Lou Williams exploded for 42 points.
Williams’ threat off the bench shouldn’t come as anything strange to the Lakers’ organization—he was a perennial candidate for NBA Sixth Man of the Year while with the Lakers between 2015 and 2017. Huge numbers off the bench have been Williams’ specialty throughout his career. He scored 40 against the Memphis Grizzlies in December 2016 and followed that up with 37 against the Utah Jazz three days later. He was Sixth Man of the Year runner-up for the 76ers in 2011-12, and won that title with the Raptors in 2014-15.

Williams’ breakout put the struggles of the Lakers’ rookie point guard into stark relief. “It was another bad night for Lonzo Ball, who ended the game with three points on one-of-seven shooting,” Drew Garrison wrote on  Silver Screen & Roll, the Lakers blog. “He missed five of his six three-point attempts, and his seven assists and five rebounds simply didn’t make up for his lack of scoring, or the three turnovers that came with his stat line.”
Williams, meanwhile, has equalled a career-high through 19 games with 18.6 ppg. The Clippers aren’t dead in the water without Griffin; as for the Lakers, it was hard to miss the bitter irony of one of their former players lighting it up while their rookie guard floundered once again at shooting the ball.




The Memphis Grizzlies fired coach David Fizdale on Monday and named J.B. Bickerstaff as the interim head coach.
Memphis is mired in an eight-game losing streak and owns a 7-12 mark this season after advancing to the playoffs in 2016-17.
“After a thorough evaluation, I decided a change in course was necessary to move forward and provide the team and organization its best chance at success this season and beyond,” Grizzlies general manager Chris Wallace said.
“Coach Fizdale represented the Grizzlies and City of Memphis proudly, and we wish him well as he continues his career.”

Fizdale has recorded a 50-51 mark since being named the 13th head coach in franchise history on May 29, 2016.
“Coach Fizdale worked tirelessly to achieve on-court success, and for that, we are grateful. We wish him and his family all the best in the future,” Grizzlies controlling owner Robert J. Pera said. “We remain focused on achieving sustainable, long-term success.”
Bickerstaff, who served as Memphis’ associate head coach, posted a 37-34 mark as an interim coach with the Houston Rockets in 2015-16.
Bickerstaff, who spent five seasons with the Rockets (2011-16), also served as an assistant coach with the Charlotte Bobcats (2004-07) and Minnesota Timberwolves (2007-11).


"This is like NBA royalty," said `Philadelphia 76ers head coach Brett Brown of LeBron James and company before the Cleveland Cavaliers walked into Wells Fargo Center on Monday night. "And you don't back away from it. You're not intimidated by it. You embrace it. I said a while ago, the group isn't coming here looking for autographs. We're here to win a game."
Shorn of two All-Star point guards for much of this season so far, the Cavaliers have at times resembled tarnished royalty—a monarchy out of step with a brave new era. Isaiah Thomas continues to watch from the sidelines in civilian dress ahead of a projected return to play in January. Derrick Rose’s situation remains uncertain.  ESPN reported on Monday that Rose was “in communication” with the Cavaliers’ front office, as he mulls over whether to try and return from an ankle injury. “Rose's increasing frustration with injuries is causing him to question his desire to continue playing,” Adrian Wojnarowski wrote.
Through those ructions, though—and despite often starting with a third-or-fourth choice point guard—the Cavaliers have kept winning. Since they lost to the Rockets on November 9, Tyronn Lue’s team has reeled off eight straight victories. The Cavs are third in the East, four games behind a Celtics team that looked ready to make some kind of assault on the Warriors’ single-season win record last week. The Celtics met Andre Drummond and the Pistons on Monday night and took some punishment, losing 118-108. Slowly, things aren’t looking so bad for the Cavaliers.
They still have a "King," of course. LeBron James put up 30 points, 13 rebounds and six assists against the kids trying to crash the Cavaliers’ Eastern Conference party. Dwyane Wade chipped in, vitally, from the bench with 15 points. Maybe more important than those 45 points between them for the old Heat buddies, though, were the intangibles they hit the baby 76ers with. “During a key sequence in the fourth quarter, it became about Wade and James vs. Joel Embiid,” Dave McMenamin wrote for  ESPN. “James punctuated the play [a 23-foot shot over Embiid] with something to say to Embiid, causing the big man to drop his head at first, before flashing a smile back at James as he walked to the bench.” The 76ers’ big man ended the night with 30 points; the Cavaliers left Philadelphia with the all-important "W." Some things change, and others, well—when you have James, many of them stay the same.
Will Rose be back? No one seems to know for sure. Thomas will be—though in what shape, again, there is uncertainty. Even without a settled, elite starting backcourt, Lue can lean on James’s (and Wade’s) enduring greatness to keep on pumping out the wins.


The University of Alabama’s vice grip over the college football regular season ended suddenly, brutally, on Saturday night at Jordan-Hare Stadium.
Nick Saban’s vaunted defense couldn’t stop Jarrett Stidham or Kerryon Johnson, who ran 30 times for Auburn University while nursing injuries; Alabama’s serviceable offense, led by Jalen Hurts, couldn’t hurt the Tigers. The final score, 26-14, and comfortable in the end for Auburn, failed to reflect the magnitude of the shock of the loss.
The ramifications are many. Auburn is going to the Southeastern Conference Championship Game next weekend to play the University of Georgia in the Mercedes-Benz Superdome in Atlanta. If the Bulldogs win, and take back their loss to the Tigers from earlier in the season, they will almost certainly represent the SEC in the College Football Playoffs.

It’s more complicated if Auburn beats Georgia next Saturday. On the one hand, that could benefit Alabama as the College Football Playoff Committee—which will make its final decision on December 3—would generate controversy by sending a two-loss team to the final four. But then, Auburn would have won the SEC  and raised questions, at least, over the caliber of teams the Crimson Tide have faced.
“While the Tide have been dominant, the committee will also point out that their best wins have come against three-loss LSU, which lost to Troy, and four-loss Mississippi State. Their only other Power 5 win against an opponent over .500 was vs. Texas A&M,” Heather Dinich wrote for  ESPN on Sunday. Alabama isn’t going to get in over the SEC champion.
That leaves three more spots open. The winner of the Atlantic Coast Conference Championship Game between Clemson and Miami will finish the regular season with one loss, so one of those two teams is getting in.
Then down to two more spots, one of which will be taken by the University of Wisconsin-Madison if it beats Ohio State in the Big Ten Championship Game on Saturday. The Badgers will have gone through the regular season unbeaten if they beat the Buckeyes. The  AP rankings, released on Sunday, had Oklahoma second behind Clemson.  SB Nation noted an irony on Saturday: without a Big 12 title game, the Sooners would almost certainly already be in the playoff thanks to a one-loss regular season and a statement win on the road against Ohio State.
But the championship game that the Big 12 introduced to make it more competitive in the national title conversation means the Sooners have to play a tough Texas Christian University team again. Win and they are in as the third seed. Lose and it gets weird. Maybe, as  SB Nation points out, TCU has a shot. But losses for Wisconsin or Oklahoma would also bring Alabama back into the conversation.
Saban’s team isn’t out of this, yet. Heading into a climactic weekend of championship games, the playoff picture remains mysterious.


Alex Smith and the Kansas City Chiefs are going about the 2017 NFL season the wrong way round.
Finish strong, the adage goes, implying a truth of professional sports: That teams that heat up down the stretch will generally be better placed than those whose bloom came in the distant summer.
Well, Andy Reid’s Chiefs started like a Mack truck, leaping out to 5-0. They went to Foxborough and handed the Patriots one of the worst defeats of the Bill Belichick era. They fought off an Eagles team that has turned out to be the NFL’s best at Arrowhead Stadium. They had a defense that could take the ball away, great special teams, and an offense with the X factors of Kareem Hunt, Tyreek Hill and Travis Kelce.
Oh, and a quarterback in Alex Smith, who had raised his game from solid to MVP level, from so-called “game-manager” to a player who looked capable of driving the Chiefs downfield every week, possibly even to Super Bowl 52.
If anyone knows how unforgiving the NFL can be as a starting quarterback, though, it is Smith. It was week nine of the 2012 season when Smith was hit by Jo-Lonn Dunbar of the then–St. Louis Rams. Smith was concussed; in came Colin Kaepernick who marched the 49ers to within a touchdown of winning Super Bowl XLVII. Smith never got his starter’s job back—it was the career trajectory that led him to Reid and the Chiefs and two Pro Bowl appearances and narrow and sometimes tragicomic playoff defeats that still promised better to come from a player who has consistently proved his doubters wrong in the second half of his career.
Up to a point, that is. Reid, like Jim Harbaugh before him, may be learning that a team can only progress so far with Smith under center. Smith wasn’t monumentally terrible on Sunday as the Chiefs lost to the Bills at Arrowhead, their fifth defeat in six games and one that put their hopes of winning the AFC West in serious peril. But he wasn’t as good as he needed to be while key parts of the offense around him struggled. It may be cruel, but in their last three games, all of them losses, the Chiefs have scored 17, 9 and 10 points. That falls on Smith. In a savage editorial, the  Kansas City Star identified Smith as one reason behind the Chiefs’ collapse. “Alex Smith for the second straight week… [was]  so off-kilter in so many ways as to leave you wondering if something’s wrong with his arm or has gotten in his head after a pretty marvelous first half of the season,” Vahe Gregorian wrote on Sunday.

Elite athlete as he is, Smith wouldn’t be human if he hadn’t considered by now that history could repeat itself. "No. That's not where I'm at right now [changing quarterbacks]. There's a couple other things I got to take care of," Reid told  NFL.com on Sunday after the loss to the Bills. But behind Smith is a potential stud in Patrick Mahomes, drafted tenth overall by the Chiefs in April.
The parallels aren’t perfect of course. This time around it would be Smith’s bad play getting him benched. And Mahomes is highly unlikely to have the same impact Kaepernick did. But if Reid is a student of football history, as he is, he will know that ripping up the playbook doesn’t have to mean giving up on the season. And that may be bad news for Smith.


After Manchester United won the Europa League in May, securing a return to the Champions League this season, José Mourinho gave an insight into his perspective on the game as a whole.
“There are lots of poets in football,” he said, “but poets don’t win many titles.” Was he referring to Arsène Wenger, his longtime adversary at Arsenal who'd failed to win the Premier League since 2004? Or maybe it was aimed at Pep Guardiola, the Manchester City manager who finished his first season in England trophyless.
What was clear was Mourinho’s justification of his method. He had won three trophies and would march right on with the same approach, dismissive of all the critics. But now, just seven months on, Mourinho has to reconsider those methods.
On Saturday, his Manchester United team travels to north London to take on Arsenal, desperately trying to keep sight of league leader Manchester City, which is eight points ahead already. In order to do that, Mourinho will have to change course.
Footage from Mourinho’s first spell in English football—with Chelsea, from 2004 through 2007—shows the Portuguese coach’s message to his players during a pre-match meeting. “I am not putting pressure on you, [saying] ‘We have to win.’ I don’t want to put that kind of pressure on you,” Mourinho told the group. “But we cannot lose. We cannot lose.” This certainly seems to be his mindset since he took over Manchester United.

When his team plays away to one of the so-called “top six” teams, it falters. Three times it has lost to Antonio Conte’s Chelsea at Stamford Bridge, a place he once called home, and failed to score.
Wayne Rooney’s 71st-minute goal against Tottenham in May was not enough to cancel Victor Wanyama and Harry Kane’s earlier goals that saw United lose in the final game at White Hart Lane.
Then came the goalless draws. Twice at Anfield, games between Liverpool and Manchester United failed to live up to anticipation, ending 0-0, while Mourinho’s only Manchester derby at Etihad Stadium also finished goalless.
The Emirates offers no happy memories for United or Mourinho either. The last two visits have ended in defeat and failure to score in 180 minutes of football. That cannot be repeated this weekend if Mourinho is to cling to any hope of catching City. Guardiola’s team hosts West Ham at Etihad Stadium, a game it is expected to take all three points from and possibly boost its goal difference even higher.
In Romelu Lukaku, Paul Pogba, Zlatan Ibrahimović, Marcus Rashford, Anthony Martial, Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Juan Mata, Mourinho has the tools to beat Arsenal. But he may need to bring some poetry to his style in order to do so.


The Oakland Raiders and the Denver Broncos found a way to breathe vitality into two listing seasons on Sunday evening: by having a wild brawl.
It didn’t take long to get going. On the second play of the Raiders’ second drive, wide receiver Michael Crabtree tangled with the Broncos’ star cornerback Aqib Talib. The two have history, as the Associated Press pointed out on Sunday evening. “Crabtree has been upset ever since Talib ripped Crabtree’s chain off his neck during the regular-season finale last season,” the AP  wrote. On this occasion, Crabtree blocked Talib and the two ended up in a bundle on the sideline. Again, Talib ripped Crabtree’s chain off his neck.
The AP pointed out another possible reason for Talib’s anger. On a play moments before, another Crabtree block had injured Chris Harris, the Broncos cornerback. “I’ve never seen that in the NFL," Harris said in quotes reported by  247Sports.com, claiming that Crabtree had sucker-punched him.

Vance Joseph, the Broncos head coach, hit out at his own team in the postgame press conference. “I don’t like it [fighting]. It’s unacceptable,” Joseph told Broncos beat reporter Zack Stevens. “We can’t lose our best players because of a personal battle. That’s a personal battle. This is about the Broncos. It’s unacceptable, we can’t have it. It’s nonnegotiable… We can’t have it." Talib and Crabtree were both ejected from the game for throwing punches at each other. (Talib’s helmet was still on; he'd ripped off Crabtree’s.) Gabe Jackson, the Raiders guard, also was ejected for pushing an official in the melee.
After the fighting, a game of football broke out. The Raiders took care of the Broncos’ anemic offense, winning 21-14 to move level with the Chargers and one game behind the slumping Kansas City Chiefs in an AFC West no one seems to want to win right now.


Tom Brady grew up in the Bay Area as a fan of the San Francisco 49ers, a team that ran up 16 straight winning seasons starting when he was just 6 years old.
Now, as a 40-year-old with all kinds of NFL records and five titles, Brady can also claim to be the leader of the team that past that 49ers’ total. Dallas is the all-time leader with 20.
“I was a kid growing up in San Mateo when the Niners were doing that, too,” Brady said after his four touchdown passes led New England to a 35-17 rout of the Miami Dolphins on Sunday that ensured the Patriots’ 17th straight winning season.
”It’s pretty cool,“ Brady said. ”The expectations are really high because of what teams in the past have done and I think (the media) look up at Coach (Bill) Belichick and understand kind of what we’re playing for and the history of the team and the expectations. They understand that.
“Winning seasons are great. Obviously, we’re trying to win every game we play. We started 2-2 and to be 9-2 with seven straight wins is pretty good, but we know our biggest games are ahead of us.”
The Patriots have five games left, four against their own division, two of those against the Buffalo Bills.
Brady took some shots from an aggressive defense and also suffered a cut on his left elbow trying to retrieve a loose ball. Despite the physical play, Brady threw two touchdown passes to tight ene Rob Gronkowski and one each to running back Rex Burkhead and Brandin Cooks. Burkhead also ran for a score as New England went 5-for-5 inside the red zone.

Miami (4-7) lost its fifth in a row and has dropped nine straight at Gillette Stadium.
“Losing (stinks) and if anybody likes losing this is the wrong sport to be in, because it is tough,” Miami center Mike Pouncey said.
Brady had a string of 189 straight passes without an interception snapped, but went on to complete his 83rd game with at least three touchdown passes.
He has thrown 54 touchdown passes and five interceptions in 23 games since returning from his Deflategate suspension. He has 26 touchdown passes this season, a record for quarterbacks in a season after turning 40. It was also his 28th game with at least four touchdown passes, third-most all-time, and he has 482 touchdown passes.
“All the good teams are going to start playing really very well and we’ve got to be one of those teams,” Brady said.
Brady finished 18 of 28 for 227 yards.
Gronkowski, who caught five passes for 82 yards, notched his 16th game with multi-touchdown catches, breaking Randy Moss’ club record. Cooks, who scored on a shovel pass from the Miami 5, recorded six catches for 83 yards.
Dion Lewis ran for 112 yards on 15 carries, the first 100-yard game of his career -- as the Patriots ran for 196 yards.
The 17 Miami points matched the highest total against the Patriots during their winning streak. They have outscored the opposition 196-92 during the streak
Safety Reshad Jones ran 14 yards with a botched New England snap (from backup center Ted Karras) and running back Kenyan Drake caught an 8-yard touchdown pass for the Miami touchdowns. Cody Parkey also kicked a 28-yard field goal.
Matt Moore, making his second start of the season with Jay Cutler out with a concussion, was 23 of 34 for 215 yards and two interceptions, and was sacked seven times.
Patriots special teamer Nate Ebner, who ran 14 yards with a direct-snap fake punt to keep the opening drive of the game going, suffered a knee injury on the play and was ruled out for the rest of the game.
The Dolphins then lost tailbacks Damien Williams (shoulder, carted off) and Senorise Perry (concussion) to injury in the second half. Cornerback Bobby McCain was lost to the Miami defense after throwing a punch at wide receiver Danny Amendola in the second half.
New England linebacker Trevor Reilly was injured in the collision with Perry and missed the rest of the game, while numerous players from both sides left the field after timeouts for injury.
Cornerback Stephon Gilmore’s interception in the end zone in the final seconds of the first half kept the Patriots perfect on the season -- they have not allowed a point in the final two minutes of a first half.
The teams play again in Miami on Dec. 11.
“It is not a good feeling right now being in this situation once again,” said Pouncey.


Manchester United boss José Mourinho revealed in a press conference today he is worried there is nothing he can do to prevent Marouane Fellaini leaving the club at the end of the season for free.
The Belgian midfielder’s contract ends in June 2018 and he has not agreed a new deal with Manchester United’s board. Reports of talks with French giants Paris Saint-Germain have caused concern for the Portuguese manager, along with rumors that Arsenal and Turkish side Besiktas are also interested.
However, Fellaini is not the only player out of contract at the end of the season. Currently, seven other players in the first team squad could leave the club in the summer.
Daley Blind, Ander Herrera, Juan Mata, Ashley Young, Luke Shaw, Michael Carrick and Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who collectively have a market value of an estimated £125 million, could all depart for free.
Under the Bosman ruling, players can move to a new club at the end of their contract without their old club receiving a fee, meaning they can agree a pre-contract with another club for a free transfer if their current contract has six months or less remaining.
Featured: Manchester United: Jose Mourinho praises Fellaini, but could be about to lose him
Carrick played his testimonial match earlier this season as United honored his service to the club, usually signaling a player is ending their time there, so a move for the 36 year old may not be surprising. Veteran forward Ibrahimovic was not even expected to be offered another deal for this season let alone one for next year, and Shaw’s future has been in question ever since Mourinho stated the Englishman does not feature in United’s plans.
But players such as Blind, Herrera, Mata, and Young—who has reinforced his status as an invaluable player in Mourinho’s side this season—are crucial parts of United’s team, having played 2,055 minutes between them so far in the Premier League.

Ahead of United’s match tomorrow at home to Brighton, Mourinho said: “I’m not involved in contracts, deals. I respect both, I respect the player because he has the right to decide his future if he finishes his contract.
“And I respect the board, because the decisions and discussions are under their control, so I just wait, wishing they will have an understanding.”
As Mourinho suggested, the players’ futures are out of his hands, but if agreements cannot be made soon the club risks losing key players without gaining any returns.


Even after the most dispiriting loss of a Cowboys season that has veered, slowly, off the rails, Jerry Jones refused to give up the ghost of a first Super Bowl in 21 years.
The Cowboys had been torched through the air by Philip Rivers and the unpredictable Chargers, who vaulted themselves into contention to win the AFC West on Thanksgiving Day and all but condemned Jones’s Boys to a defeat that leaves them relying on the incompetence of the teams above them in the NFC to make the playoffs.
It isn’t happening, not least because the Cowboys are now two games behind the Falcons who occupy the NFC’s sixth seed. Because Ezekiel Elliott has three more games of a suspension to serve, and without him Dak Prescott keeps throwing interceptions as he tries to jump-start an offense lacking its motor. (Prescott threw three more picks against the Chargers on Thursday night in Arlington). Because even if they  caught  the Falcons, if the offense could right itself in Elliott’s absence, then there are still the Packers, the Lions, the Seahawks to jump over. One of those teams is going to win as many if not more of their remaining games than the Cowboys.
Without Elliott the Cowboys are a bad offense. Without Sean Lee, the middle linebacker and spiritual leader of the defense, they cannot keep teams out of their own endzone. The Lee-less defense let Rivers complete 27 of 33 passes for 434 yards and three touchdowns. Wide receiver Keenan Allen caught 11 passes for 172 yards.  NFL.com noted that the Cowboys couldn’t force a punt all game. Almost everything that could have gone wrong, went wrong. Zach Martin, a key part of the offensive line, was ruled out of the game with a concussion. Even the sunlight beat Jason Garrett’s team. “Sun glare in AT&T Stadium could have cost the Cowboys,” Kevin Patra wrote on  NFL.com. “Rookie corner Jourdan Lewis dropped a would-be interception in the second quarter with the score tied. It appeared Lewis lost the ball in the sun and had it deflect off his hands, falling harmlessly to the turf.”
And still, Jones believes. "I think you have [Cowboys] players that have played at high levels and won games," Jones told  ESPN. "But the answer [to whether the Cowboys can make the postseason] is yes, as long as you have a breath to get into the playoffs. We had the Giants come up the backside here and beat the top seed. They won the whole thing five, six, seven years ago. That's what is great about this game."
Such steadfast zealotry is weirdly admirable. It’s the way Jones has always been as Cowboys owner, of course: an indefatigable exhorter. It’s also dangerous for Garrett. "I don't want to look like they're [the Cowboys coaching staff] getting the proverbial endorsement," Jones said. "That's not what's happening, the vote of confidence. I want to say it the best I can. That's not what I'm saying. I feel good about our staff.” If Jones thinks the Cowboys are sneaking into the playoffs, he is mistaken. And that could, eventually, cost a luckless Garrett his job.


If the Golden State Warriors had flown out of Oklahoma City on Wednesday night with a 14th tick of the season in the ‘Win’ column, maybe Kevin Durant could have shrugged off the inevitable questions about Russell Westbrook.
But that didn’t happen. The Warriors were outplayed at Chesapeake Energy Arena and suffered their worst loss of the young season so far, hounded and eventually beaten 108-91 by the previously stuttering Thunder, for whom the “Big Three” of Russell Westbrook, Paul George and Carmelo Anthony finally came good together on the same night.
George had 20 points, 11 rebounds and an assist; Anthony was second on the team with 22. But Westbrook outshone both—and the Warriors’ starry cast, too—with 34 points, ten rebounds and nine assists. It was the reigning MVP’s best statistical performance of the season so far, a period defined by the Thunder offense’s inability to cohere for 48 minutes a night.
There was schadenfreude in the air, too. The Thunder crowd booed Durant when he was introduced before the game, and repeated that when he touched the ball. "It seemed pretty civil compared to last year," Steve Kerr, the Warriors head coach, said in quotes reported by  ESPN. "It was all good, and they deserved to win, and the crowd deserved to get the joy that they got out of this game." Skip Bayless, the Fox Sports pundit, piled in on Twitter. “FINALLY: Russ [Westbrook] and the great fans in a great city got some revenge over Kevin Durant,” Bayless wrote. “This wasn't about Melo or Paul George. It was about RUSS SHOWING AND TELLING KD.”

Durant, like Kerr, attempted to play down any deeper significance to a number of clashes between himself and Westbrook during the game. With just under six minutes to go in the third quarter, and the Thunder leading by 17, Durant and Westbrook went head-to-head. The  YouTube clip, posted by Bleacher Report, appears to show Durant calling Westbrook a “P***y.” “You’re soft,” Westbrook replied according to  ESPN. "The story is about the game. We lost. They kicked our ass,” Durant told  Anthony Slater, The Athletic’s Warriors reporter. “They played a great game. We should give them credit for how they played, and we should be better. It's not about who's in each other's faces. That stuff is not real, so please don't believe it. All the fans, they lied to y'all. It's about basketball, and they played a great game, and we didn't."
Kerr did admit that the Warriors “lacked focus” in the final game of a road trip that they split 2-2. It’s too tempting not to wonder whether all of the subplots, Durant’s rivalry with Westbrook chief among them, might have piled distraction upon weariness for Golden State. Durant has a ring, of course, and he will still probably be laughing longest and loudest at the end of the season. But here was a measure of something—call it revenge, or schadenfreude—for Westbrook and a city, for a night.


LeBron James received a kick in the rear from his coach and a head butt from an opponent. Then, he delivered a gut punch. 
James scored 23 points in the fourth quarter, including an 18-point run on his own, and the Cleveland Cavaliers beat the Brooklyn Nets 119-109 on Wednesday night. 
James, who left the game early in the third quarter to get stitches for a facial laceration, finished with 33 points, six rebounds and five assists. He was injured when Tyler Zeller’s noggin caught James in the mouth, sending him for stitches. 
How many? “Enough to close the wound,” James said. 
The Cavs led 100-99 with 4:25 remaining when James stepped to the line for free throws that sparked his 18 consecutive points. 
When James was finished—on a 3-pointer with 55.6 seconds to go—the Cavs led 118-107 and it was all over. 
“You’ve got to let it come to you,” James said. “It’s times when you wish you can do it and sometimes when the ball just doesn’t go in. But I put a lot of work into my craft and I believe that every shot I take is going to go in. But without my teammates setting screens and defending, getting the rebounds, cutting, and things of that nature, then none of that is even possible for me, so, they get the most credit.”

Cleveland (11-7) has won six straight and is 8-2 since losing to the Nets on October 25. Kevin Love added 18 points and 10 rebounds for the Cavs, who also received 18 points off the bench from Dwyane Wade. 
Brooklyn took a 46-45 lead into halftime despite committing 10 turnovers that turned into 10 Cleveland points. 
James actually missed a dunk in the first quarter, in rare and embarrassing fashion. He intercepted a pass from Caris LeVert and was en route to a breakaway slam, but after whipping the ball around the air, clanged it off the rim with 3:49 left in the period. 
The Cavs were ahead 18-10 at the time and led just 20-17 at the end of the quarter. 
“He was messing around,” Cleveland coach Tyronn Lue said. “I told him at halftime, ‘You messing around.’ He got a little upset and that’s good. Get hit (in the mouth) again.” 
Rondae Hollis-Jefferson led the Nets (6-11) with 20 points. Joe Harris was one point off his career-high with 18 off the bench, and Allen Crabbe added 15 points. 
“I was proud of our competitive grit,” Brooklyn coach Kenny Atkinson said. “LeBron really took over. There’s no other way to put it.” 
Harris, who shot 7 of 10 from the field with four 3s, was taken in the second round of the 2014 draft by Cleveland, and he was on the team for its first Finals match with the Golden State Warriors in 2015. 
The Cavs traded Harris to Orlando in January 2016, to clear a roster spot. He was waived and signed with the Nets the following summer. 
“The enjoyment would’ve been if we won,” Harris said. 
“I think that it’s always nice coming back to a place where you spent some time. We have a lot of guys in the organization who have spent time here, a lot of good people in the Cavs’ organization. It’s good to come back and see some familiar faces and be able to say hello to people who you otherwise would not see.” 
The Nets led by seven in the third quarter when James left the game. He returned with 4:33 to go in the third, and had scored just eight points at the time. 
His 23-point fourth quarter was two points shy of his personal best 25, from when he scored 61 on March 3, 2014. The Cavs scored 42 in the fourth, one point shy of their season best. 
“He scored 23 in the fourth and we needed every bit of it,” Lue said. “When he came back, I thought he did a really good job of getting into the paint, playing downhill.”


Thanksgiving always seems like an opportune moment to evaluate playoff prospects in the NFL, and this year looks to be no different.
The league will present a triple-header on Thursday, including what looks like a game that could decide the direction of the NFC North and the Cowboys’ last shot at the playoffs when they host the unpredictable Chargers. Here’s how to watch all of Thursday’s games.
Vikings @ Lions
Probably the Lions’ last chance to catch the surging Vikings for the NFC North title and avoid a likely trip to the New Orleans Saints on Wild Card Weekend. A road win for the Vikings, for whom Case Keenum continues to impress at quarterback, would send them to 9-2 on the season, well within reach of the Eagles for the No. 1 seed in the NFC and home-field advantage throughout the playoffs.
Realistically, the Lions are chasing the Falcons with whom they share a 6-4 record but would lose out to in a tiebreaker. This Lions vintage feels like many of the previous iterations in the Matthew Stafford era: Dangerous through the air, but with a defense that probably won’t take it very far into the postseason. Stafford is piling up the stats—he scooted past Troy Aikman in all-time passing yards over the weekend. But will he ever quarterback a bona fide Super Bowl contender?

Chargers @ Cowboys
The Cowboys probably won’t have to run the table to make the playoffs from here but they don’t have much room for manoeuvre anymore. The 37-9 defeat to the Eagles at AT&T Stadium showed two teams apparently moving in different directions—one, possibly, towards its first Super Bowl and the loser contemplating having to leapfrog four NFC rivals to sneak into the playoffs as the sixth seed. The Eagles also showed up the Cowboys’ offense for what it is without Ezekiel Elliott: Limited. Alfred Morris gained 91 yards on 17 carries on the ground but he lacks ‘Zeke’s’ dynamism and cannot keep defenses honest for Dak Prescott in the way the former Buckeye can. Prescott had a horrible Sunday afternoon, throwing three picks and no touchdowns.
The good news for the Cowboys is that the Chargers are talented but mistake-prone as usual and seemingly just drifting along in the AFC West. The bad news? The Kansas City Chiefs’ midseason stutters mean that improbably, they are only two games out of the division lead. A team that has Philip Rivers under center will always be liable to put together a series of wins, so the playoffs haven’t disappeared in the rearview mirror yet for the Chargers. This could be a perfect storm for the Cowboys, too, who have much bigger problems at left tackle than at running back. All-Pro Tyron Smith may be able to play on Thursday, according to CBS. In his two-game absence, the Cowboys have given up 12 sacks and now they get to face Joey Bosa and Melvin Ingram, maybe the NFL’s most fearsome combination of defensive ends.

Giants @ Redskins
When the Giants and the Redskins come together it’s never futile, of course. But in terms of the NFC playoff picture, this matchup is essentially meaningless. The Giants have been flat-out miserable this year under Ben McAdoo, and the 12-9 win over the Chiefs last Sunday looks like an anomaly in a season that may yet cost the sophomore coach his job. In a scathing review this week, the  New York Post gave McAdoo a chance of being the Giants’ head coach next season, but only if he wins all four remaining divisional games this season.
The Redskins’ problems aren’t hard to figure out. Jay Gruden’s team has one of the NFL’s better passing offenses, led by Kirk Cousins, but the 31st-worst defense in the league in terms of points-per-game allowed. And Gruden may lose Cousins at the end of this season, anyway.

After another 10-month spell away and a fourth back operation in three years, Tiger Woods is “pain free” and could be back playing competitively as early as next week.
That is according to fellow former world number one and friend Jason Day, who says it is the first time in three years that Woods is waking up without pain ahead of his return at next week’s Hero World Challenge.
Woods, who has not played competitive golf for 10 months as he recovers from a fourth operation on his back in three years, will be making his comeback next week at his own tournament in Albany, Bahamas.
“I did talk to him and he did say it’s the best he’s ever felt in three years, he doesn’t wake up with pain anymore, which is great,” Day said Wednesday ahead of the Australian Open.
“I totally understand where he’s coming from because sometimes I wake up and it takes me about 10 minutes to get out of bed. For him to be in pain for three years is very frustrating.”

The winner of five tournaments in 2013, 41-year-old Woods has played just 19 events since.
The 14-times major champion made a previous comeback at the Hero World Challenge last year after nearly 16 months on the sidelines, finishing 15th in a final field of 17.
He showed flashes of brilliance but struggled with accuracy. Woods returned to the PGA Tour in January but missed the cut at the Farmers Insurance Open before shooting an opening-round 77 a week later at the European Tour’s Dubai Desert Classic and withdrawing.
In April, he said he had undergone a fourth operation on his back in three years.
Australian Day, now world number 12 after a lean spell of his own with no wins this year, said the Hero World Challenge was the perfect tournament for Woods to make his return.
“With regards to him playing next week, there’s no pressure,” Day added.
”It’s an 18-man field, there’s no cut... it’s obviously a tournament that suits him, that he likes.
“He says he’s ready and I‘m hoping he is. From what he says, he’s been hitting it long and if he is hitting it long and straight, it’s going to be tough for us.”


Kristaps Porzingis is calling for the New York Knicks to take revenge on the Toronto Raptors on Wednesday night after their resounding 107-84 defeat over the weekend.
Porzingis was among the Knicks players who were off form at the Air Canada Centre on Saturday, shooting 3 for 13 while Tim Hardaway Jr. finished 5 for 11. The Knicks ended the game with their lowest field goal percentage of the year.  
“We want to get our revenge,” Porzingis said Tuesday, as quoted by the  New York Post. “They played great at home, we played bad and it’s going to be an opportunity for us.”
The 22-year-old forward says the Knicks are now a “playoff team,” a prospect that seemed improbable after the 0-5 preseason.
And Knicks have bounced back from the loss to the Raptors by beating the Los Angeles Clippers 107-85 on Monday night at Madison Square Garden. Porzingis scored 25 points on 7 for 20 shooting, and even outplayed Blake Griffin. The Latvian also appears to have accepted being the new face of the franchise.

“The city is behind us. They love that we play hard,” he said. “I have a bigger role obviously, but I would say the expectations are lower than my first two years and I believe we’re playing above the expectations. So I don’t really feel the pressure.
“I enjoy having the pressure a little bit on and having to play through that and then doing what you’re supposed to. And even if it’s not there, maybe the pressure’s not that high, the expectation is not that high, it’s even better to surprise people and do something they weren’t expecting.”
And the Knicks are doing that. They are currently sixth in the East with a 9-7 record, and probably wishing the season could end right about now. 


Gabby Douglas is the latest member of the USA’s London 2012 Olympic gold medal–winning gymnastics team to say that team doctor Larry Nassar sexually abused her.
Douglas, 21, follows teammates McKayla Maroney and Aly Raisman in accusing Nassar of abuse. Her allegations came five days after she posted a response about Raisman's allegations and was accused of victim blaming when she said women should “dress modestly” to avoid “the wrong crowd.” She later deleted her tweet.
A representative for the gymnast confirmed to  USA Today that Douglas was also accusing Nassar of abuse, following a lengthy statement on her Instagram account captioned, "please hear my heart."
“I know that no matter what you wear, it NEVER gives anyone the right to harass or abuse you,” she wrote. “It would be like saying that because of the leotards we wore, it was our fault that we were abused by Larry Nassar.
“I didn’t publicly share my experiences as well as many other things because for many years we were conditioned to stay silent and honestly some things were extremely painful,” Douglas wrote.

Douglas, Maroney and Raisman were part of the "fierce five" that won gold at the Olympic games in London five years ago.
Nassar is currently in jail awaiting sentencing after pleading guilty to federal child pornography charges. He is due in court on Wednesday and is reportedly set to be jailed for 25 years due to a deal agreed with prosecutors.
Nassar’s work with the national gymnastics team began in 1986, and he spent almost three decades as an osteopath for the USA Gymnastics program. USA Gymnastics fired him in 2016 following several allegations of sexual misconduct.
According to the Associated Press, the 54-year-old former doctor will plead guilty to multiple charges of sexual assault and is accused of molesting seven girls—all bar one were gymnasts.
The abuse allegedly took place during scheduled treatments at his home in the Lansing area and at a campus clinic at Michigan State University. Similar lawsuits have been filed by 125 women and girls in neighboring counties.
A plea deal has a minimum prison sentence of 25 years, but a judge can set the minimum sentence to as high as 40 years.
The allegations say Nassar molested girls with his hands when they were seeking medical attention for sports injuries, some of which took place while parents were in the room. Neither Douglas nor Raisman has specified the details of their abuse as of yet.


Refusing to let his feud with the Ball family simmer, Donald Trump launched a new attack on LaVar on Wednesday morning.
In his first tweet of the day, the president launched a tirade apparently in reference to LaVar’s interview with  CNN on Monday, in which he again cast doubt on Trump’s repeated assertions that a telephone call with President Xi Jinping of China had led to the release of LiAngelo, LaVar’s middle son and a U.C.L.A. freshman, despite shoplifting charges. LiAngelo and teammates Cody Riley and Jalen Hill stole from three stories in Hangzhou, The New York Times reported on November 15. They have since been suspended from basketball activities indefinitely. “It wasn’t the White House, it wasn’t the State Department, it wasn’t father LaVar’s so-called people on the ground in China that got his son out of a long term prison sentence—IT WAS ME,” Trump  tweeted. “Too bad! LaVar is just a poor man’s version of Don King, but without the hair. Just think..”
Trump, who was on a visit to the Far East last week, met with President Xi and discussed the release of the players. On November 15, as LiAngelo, Riley and Hill returned home, Trump  tweeted, “Do you think the three UCLA Basketball Players will say thank you President Trump? They were headed for 10 years in jail!” The three players did thank Trump at a press conference later that day.

Trump’s very public acknowledgement of his own role, though, started a war of words with LaVar, the voluble Ball family patriarch, through the media. “Who?” Ball had retorted to  ESPN ’s Arash Markazi on Sunday when asked about Trump’s self-proclaimed involvement in LiAngelo’s release. “What was he over there [in China] for? Don’t tell me nothing. Everybody wants to make it seem like he helped me out.” Trump hit back on Sunday, tweeting that LaVar was, “Unaccepting” of his help and that he, “Should have left them [the U.C.L.A. players] in jail.”
LaVar responded on Monday in a typically pugnacious interview with  CNN. “If I feel nobody did anything; I don’t have to go around saying thank you to everybody,” he told Chris Cuomo. “Just because people say things [doesn’t mean] it’s supposed to be true. ‘Hey, I stopped them from [doing 10 years in prison]. Maybe we were doing some talking with some other people before [Trump] even got there.”
Eight minutes after likening LaVar to Don King, Trump sent a follow-up tweet calling the founder of the ‘Big Baller Brand’ an “Ungrateful fool.” “ LaVar, you could have spent the next 5 to 10 years during Thanksgiving with your son in China, but no NBA contract to support you,” Trump wrote. “But remember LaVar, shoplifting is NOT a little thing. It’s a really big deal, especially in China. Ungrateful fool!”
LaVar’s eldest son, the quiet and reserved Los Angeles Lakers point guard Lonzo Ball, had eight points and 13 rebounds on Tuesday night as Luke Walton’s team beat the Bulls 103-94 at Staples Center.


Luke Walton insisted he’s not concerned about suggestions that he and his fellow Los Angeles Lakers coaches are being “too soft” and “babying” Lonzo Ball after watching his team beat the Chicago Bulls 103-94 on Tuesday.
The accusations came from Ball's father, Lavar, in an interview with  Bleacher Report in which he said he didn’t have an issue with Walton but did have a problem with losing. The Lakers are now on a two-game winning streak while Ball became only the second player in franchise history to score two triple-doubles as a rookie last week.
“He’s been away from me too long,” Ball said of his son. “I see tendencies in his game—they’re trying to baby him a little bit […] They’re soft. They don’t know how to coach my son. I know how to coach him.”
Asked for his reaction to the comments at Staples Center on Tuesday night, Walton said: “Absolutely nothing. It’s not what we’re here to do or talk about.
“So we’re not concerned with what parents think of how we’re coaching the team,” he said, as quoted by  Lakers Nation. “We’re concerned with what’s best for our team and how we can continue to get better.”
And Kentavious Caldwell-Pope certainly helped the Lakers get better in this game, scoring 11 of his 21 points in the closing minutes as the home team rallied from a 19-point, second-half deficit to defeat the Chicago Bulls 103-94.

Kyle Kuzma scored a game-high 22 points, Brandon Ingram added 17, Jordan Clarkson scored 12 off the bench and Julius Randle contributed 10 in a reserve role for Los Angeles (8-10).
Denzel Valentine shot 5 of 7 from 3-point range and scored 17 points to lead five starters in double figures for the Bulls (3-12).
Antonio Blakeney, on a two-way contract that allows him to split time between the Bulls and their G-League affiliate, the Windy City Bulls, scored 15 off the bench for Chicago.
The Lakers rallied to tie the score at 80 on a layup by Josh Hart with 9:32 left. Los Angeles finally went ahead 89-87 when Caldwell-Pope put back a missed 3-pointer with 3:06 remaining.
Caldwell-Pope followed with two 3-pointers that stretched the lead to five each time, and the Lakers kept Chicago from getting back within one possession.

The Bulls took their biggest lead at 61-42 with 10:29 left in the third quarter. An 8-2 run pulled Los Angeles within 13, but the Lakers didn’t begin to make a charge until Clarkson replaced Lonzo Ball and joined Kuzma, Randle, Caldwell-Pope and Hart.
The Lakers cut the deficit to one on a 3-pointer by Clarkson with 35 seconds left in the third quarter and then trailed 75-72 entering the fourth.
Behind double-digit first-half scoring efforts from Blakeney (15), Robin Lopez (12) and Valentine (11), the Bulls led by as many as 18 before taking a 56-42 lead into the break.
Blakeney entered with 4:58 left in the first quarter and scored 15 points in his first eight minutes, including 11 straight for the Bulls during one stretch, helping Chicago to a 41-26 lead.


Before the week that could save Michigan’s season, at least in terms of pride, the  Chicago Tribune gave the hornet’s nest a hefty kick.
“I am convinced that old Thing One [Jim Harbaugh] is the one thing the Bears need,” Bernie Lincicome wrote in his  column, an intriguing nostalgia piece crossed with personal recollection of meeting Harbaugh when he was the Bears’ quarterback, having succeeded the colorful Jim McMahon.
Harbaugh, as Lincicome remembers him, was personable and eager to learn—the opposite of McMahon, the Bears’ legendary Super Bowl-winning quarterback who Lincicome says called him a "creep."
Personable and curious—two words that came to define Harbaugh as an NFL head coach, when he led the 49ers to within a down of winning the Super Bowl and to an NFC Championship game. It was Harbaugh, of course, who gave Colin Kaepernick his break after Alex Smith got concussed midway through the 2012 season. What strange memories those are, both distant and vivid: Kaepernick, now suing the NFL’s owners for alleged collusion, torching and befuddling the Packers with his legs in the 2012 NFC Divisional Game at Candlestick Park. Maybe the 49ers would never have got within three points of the Ravens in Super Bowl XLVII had the lights not gone out in the Mercedes-Benz Superdome. But Harbaugh’s bravery, and Kaepernick’s revolutionary skills, perhaps should have brought the 49ers a Championship.

Out of the reverie and back into the present. Harbaugh’s Wolverines have lost three times this season, each one of them hurtful. To Michigan State—ouch—in a low-scoring slugfest on October 7 in the Big House—even worse. To Penn State in a blowout away from home on October 21. And to Wisconsin on November 18, this past weekend, when it also lost quarterback Brandon Peters to a head injury. Peters was taken off on a cart and to hospital with concussion after he was knocked unconscious, according to the  Detroit Free Press. The  Free Press also pointed out that Peters was pressured on 13 of 25 dropbacks by one of the most fearsome defenses in college football. An injury was almost inevitable although Peters may yet play against the Buckeyes, according to a report on Tuesday by  MLive.com.
Almost three seasons into Harbaugh’s tenure as Wolverines head coach, and the games he has lost feel more memorable than those he has won. Like 2016’s double-overtime victory for the Buckeyes, that dropped Michigan out of national title contention, or the one-point shock by Iowa the same year. The Wolverines are a semi-serious proposition again under Harbaugh but it is clear that plenty of surgery is still required, especially for that offensive line that had Peters scrambling so often against the Badgers. This season is fizzling out: Michigan is fourth in the Big Ten East, heading into Saturday’s game, and unranked this week by the  AP. Its head coach likely isn’t going anywhere. But Lincicome’s piece was a timely reminder that the NFL still covets Harbaugh.


After Sunday’s resounding win against the Denver Nuggets, the Los Angeles Lakers seem to have turned a corner. They may be 10th in the West, but Luke Walton’s team has been among the best in the league on defense.
It is the offense that needs work—and, in particular, more players with the ability to shoot the ball. The fact  Lonzo Ball recorded his second triple-double on Sunday and helped  the Lakers to a win at Staples Center merely covered the team's otherwise chronic shortcomings.
But Walton and  the Lakers management have a plan. In order to aid their perimeter shooting, the franchise is considering signing free agent Mindaugas Kuzminskas, who was waived by the New York Knicks earlier this month to facilitate the return of Joakim Noah.
“The respect this franchise has for Mindaugas cannot be overstated,” Knicks General Manager Scott Perry said  in a statement. “His professionalism and work ethic were greatly appreciated by his teammates, coaches and the entire staff. The decision was extremely tough for us. We wish him nothing but the best moving on with his playing career.”

And that may see him land in  Los Angeles. According to Ohm Youngmisuk of ESPN, the franchise is currently in talks with Kuzminskas. “The Lakers are keeping tabs on free agent Mindaugas Kuzminskas,”  Youngmisuk wrote. “According to sources with knowledge of the team's thinking, the Lakers, in need of perimeter shooting, are doing their due diligence and met with the forward recently while they evaluate their wing depth.”
But who actually is Mindaugas Kuzminskas, and how is he going to solve  the Lakers’ scoring issues?
He began his career with BC Sakalai in his native Lithuania in 2006, playing in the Lithuanian Basketball League and Baltic Basketball League. He spent just a year there before joining Perlas Vilnius and then moved on to Siauliai in 2008. Two years with Siauliai earned him a move to Zalgiris Kaunas, one of the oldest teams in the EuroLeague, and it was here that he made a name for himself.
Kuzminskas made the Lithuanian Basketball League All-Star team in each of his three seasons, and he was named MVP in 2010, when Zalgiris won the LKF Cup. He went abroad in 2013, signing a contract with Spanish team Unicaja Malaga. Over 36 games, he averaged 10.3 points, 3 rebounds and 1.1 assists per game, and he was signed by the Knicks in July 2016.
Kuzminskas made 68 appearances as a rookie for the Knicks but played just once in his second season before being waived. Now 28 years old, the small forward is a free agent and could be of help to the Lakers.
Last year, he shot 32.1 percent from 3-point range, which would be fourth highest in the current Lakers roster, behind Jordan Clarkson, Brook Lopez and Kyle Kuzma.
There would be one small hurdle to jump if the Lakers are to sign Kuzminskas, however. The franchise is currently at its roster limit and would need to release someone to make room for a new signing.  


Maybe you could say it was worrying that the Boston Celtics dug themselves another hole against the drifting Dallas Mavericks at American Airlines Center on Monday night. You could ask, rhetorically, how long a team relying on youthful exuberance can keep up these kinds of comebacks. You can argue—with righteousness—that 18 games into an NBA season isn’t long enough to make even tentative conclusions about what is going to happen in June.
You can’t argue, though, with two basic facts. The Celtics are on a 16-game winning streak and Kyrie Irving is proving to be more clutch than anyone except Kyrie Irving could have expected when he moved from the Cavaliers this past summer.
Irving was luminous on Monday, with 47 points, six assists, three rebounds and a steal in 38 minutes. Ten of those came in overtime, after the Mavericks had led 87-74 with just under eight minutes to play. The Celtics got another big effort from Jayson Tatum, the third overall pick in the 2017 NBA Draft, too. Tatum had 15 points, nine rebounds, a steal, assist and block. Jaylen Brown contributed 22 points and nine rebounds of his own.

But both of those impressive youngsters are being led by Irving—the  leading he set out to do when he left LeBron James’s six-foot-eight-inch shadow behind in the summer. "I don't really see it as a pressure situation," Irving said of his late-game play. "It's just like playing basketball, man.” Imagining how the Celtics would have gone with Gordon Hayward on the court is futile, of course, unless you turn it around and suggest that Irving has had to step up to fill the void, both in scoring and veteran leadership. That is to say that the Celtics got more out of the trade than they might have done had their marquee free agent been fit to share the load. That Tatum and Brown might not have progressed so fast. Which isn’t to say that the Celtics won’t be even better when Hayward returns, and that is a scary prospect.
If the season finished at this point, Irving would have to be among the frontrunners for M.V.P., alongside James, James Harden, the Bucks’ Giannis Antetokounmpo, and maybe a couple of bolters like Kristaps Porzingis and DeMar DeRozan, the league’s best shooting guard and the best player on the Eastern Conference’s second-best team.
It’s a good job there are still so many games and twists to go, to ensure that we look completely wrong and silly by the time the Finals finish next summer. One conclusion that won’t be upended, though: What Brad Stevens, Irving and the Celtics are doing right now is damned impressive.


British businesswoman Amanda Staveley is behind a £300 million (about $398 million) bid to buy Premier League club Newcastle United, according to reports.
Staveley is involved with negotiations alongside her PCP Partners Capital group, a private investment firm, to buy the club that is based in the north-east of England and was promoted to the Premier League last season.
According to the  Newcastle Chronicle, Staveley, 44, has signed a non-disclosure agreement with the club ahead of an official bid, but was recently seen in attendance at St. James’s Park for a game against Liverpool.
After 10 years at the helm, current owner Mike Ashley said he wanted to sell the club and wanted the deal to be done by Christmas—but he is seeking a sale closer to £380 million. So, who is the multimillionaire businesswoman seeking to take his place on Tyneside?
Staveley was born and raised in Yorkshire, a county in the north of England. The daughter of landowner Robert Staveley, whose estate was bestowed to his ancestors by Cardinal Wolsey in 1516, Staveley studied modern languages at Cambridge University but dropped out after suffering from stress. Aged 22, she opened a restaurant with a £180,000 loan despite having no training.
The restaurant, Stocks, quickly proved to be a success, and acted as a meeting point for members of Newmarket's equestrian elite. It was here that Staveley met the ruler of Dubai Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al Maktoum, which sparked a relationship that would make her one of the most influential people in the region from outside the Gulf. Staveley closed Stocks and, in 2000, expanded her business by buying the Q.ton conference center at Cambridge Science Park.
It was in 2001 that Staveley first met Prince Andrew when she gave him a tour of the Science Park. The following day, Prince Andrew invited Staveley out for dinner and secretly proposed to her in 2003, according to British newspaper The Daily Telegraph. But the engagement is said to have been broken off due to the amount of media attention that would come with being the second duchess of York.

A 2008 profile of Staveley by the Telegraph, described Staveley as the “new Queen of British football,” such was her influence on some of the game’s biggest teams. Her working relationship with Sheikh Mansour of Abu Dhabi saw her broker his takeover of Manchester City almost a decade ago, while she also headed up Sheikh Mohammed’s unsuccessful bid to buy Liverpool. Staveley had reportedly been offered a seat on the board if the deal had gone through.
Staveley is reportedly awaiting a response from Ashley on the offer, but the current owner is said to be disappointed that details of the sale have been made public. PCP Capital Partners has been in talks with Newcastle for around a month but a formal offer has only just been made. Staveley’s firm would need to go through the Football Association’s “fit and proper persons test” for potential new owners of English football clubs, which has already been scheduled, according to  The Times.
Founder of U.K. sports retailer Sports Direct, Ashley bought the club for £134.4 million in 2007 and has experienced a turbulent reign at the head of the club. He has seen the team relegated twice and been hit with supporter backlash with fans calling for him to leave. Newcastle manager Rafael Benitez, who led the team to promotion last season, is said to have been kept up-to-date with details of the negotiations by the club’s managing director Lee Charnley.


For once, LeBron James was only partially responsible for a Cleveland Cavaliers blowout. And that’s probably a good thing going forward for everyone concerned.
James has been playing monstrous quantities of minutes so far in the 2017-18 NBA season, as the Cavaliers have battled to overcome a lack of consistency at point guard and some of the more serious defensive issues in the league. The 32 year old played a season-high 46 minutes for 39 points against the Clippers on November 18, and he hadn’t dipped below 36 minutes in any of the Cavaliers’ games up until Monday night.
Against the Pistons, though, James was limited to 27 minutes—still joint second on the team, behind stand-in starting point guard Jose Calderon. James chipped in with 18 points and eight assists but, unusually for this season, the Cavaliers got balanced scoring from all over the court. Kevin Love led the team with 19 points while Jae Crowder had 18. Calderon had 14 while Jeff Green and Channing Frye scored 11 and 10 respectively. By halftime, the Cavaliers led 73-46 against perhaps the biggest surprise of the fall so far. It was never even a contest. Having started the season 3-5, the Cavaliers have won five in a row to move to 10-7, a game behind the Pistons in the Eastern Conference standings.
That they look primed for another deep playoff run following that sticky beginning is largely down to James’ efforts. Coming into Monday night’s game, James led the NBA in minutes-per-game, with 37.9. Only the Milwaukee Bucks’ extraordinary, do-everything 22 year old, Giannis Antetokounmpo, is anywhere close to James’s average. Even after those 27 minutes against the Pistons—Tyronn Lue pulled him with 1.43 to play, with the Cavaliers leading by 37—James  still leads the league.
Not that James, or Lue, wanted to dwell on that topic very much following the conclusion of the game. "You [reporters] make so much a big thing about my minutes," James said according to  ESPN. "It's not a huge issue. But at the end of the day, when we can get a win like this, everybody benefits from it. Not just me. Everybody."
"I hear about that all the time," Lue said. (ESPN reported he sounded “somewhat perturbed” when asked about James’ minutes). "I played with Michael Jordan when he was 39, he played 37 minutes a night. Karl Malone was 37, played 38 minutes a night, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Magic Johnson, Kobe [Bryant]. Everybody's built different. If you're one of the greats, sometimes you've got to play, sometimes you get rest like tonight."
It’s understandable that the Cavaliers want to shrug the question away. But the implications for the rest of their season could be huge if they can find enough scoring not to wear James out before the playoffs. James may appear superhuman at times, but he will wear down like any other elite athlete. At least on Monday, Lue found a solution to preserve the body of the man without whom the Cavaliers cannot win a Championship.


The NBA’s Central Division standings show the Detroit Pistons at the top. The Cleveland Cavaliers sent a message on Monday who really rules the division until further notice. 
Kevin Love had 19 points, 11 rebounds and four assists, and the Cavaliers extended their winning streak to five games with a 116-88 romp over the Pistons. 
The Cavs took the lead for good midway through the first quarter and turned the fourth quarter into extended garbage time. 
LeBron James supplied 18 points and eight rebounds while playing just 27 minutes in the blowout for Cleveland (10-7). 
“I just wanted to keep the pedal down,” James said. “We haven’t had a win like this in a very long time. We come out sometimes in the third quarter and have a slow start and teams get back into it. But today, we just kept it going. That’s a pretty big step for us.” 
Jae Crowder contributed 18 points and Jose Calderon tossed in 14 for the Cavaliers, who led by as much as 39. Cleveland shot 52.5 percent (42 of 80) from the field and 48.5 percent (16 of 33) from long range.

“We just have been playing well of late,” James said. “We’re in a good groove right now, and we wanted to try to continue that coming in here today. They’ve been playing extremely good basketball, coming off a great win last night in Minnesota. We knew they were going to come out and try to give us their best shot, and we had to be ready for that. But we just had a lot of flurries. We had a lot of flurries and we didn’t stop.”

None of the Cavaliers played more than 28 minutes, a welcome development for one of the league’s oldest teams. 
“It’s not a huge issue,” James said of his minutes. “But at the end of the day, when we can get a win like this, everybody benefits from it, not just me.” 
Andre Drummond’s streak of grabbing 12 or more rebounds since the start of the season ended at 16 games. The Detroit center was held to eight points and eight rebounds while committing six turnovers.

Tobias Harris had 11 points, and Stanley Johnson and Reggie Jackson added 10 apiece for the Pistons (11-6). Detroit, which has lost three of its past four games, had its six-game home winning streak snapped. 
“You just brush that one off your shoulder,” Johnson said. “It’s only one loss in the column. I thought we were playing pretty good before that.” 
Cleveland fired in 11 of 17 three-point attempts in the first half and opened a 73-46 lead. 
“For most teams in this league, there’s three, four, five of those games a year,” Pistons coach Stan Van Gundy said. “Tonight was one of them. We didn’t play well at either end, we made mistakes and they played terrifically.” 
The Cavs finished the first quarter on a 19-5 run to gain a 36-23 lead. James, who had 16 points in the quarter, started it with two 3-pointers. Love scored eight points during that stretch. 
Channing Frye scored eight points early in the second, helping the Cavs push the lead to 20 points. 
J.R. Smith hit Cleveland’s last three-pointer of the half during the final minute, and Crowder provided the 27-point lead with a pair of free throws.


On Monday night, Tyronn Lue will turn to veteran point guard Jose Calderon when the Cleveland Cavaliers take on the Detroit Pistons.
With  Isaiah Thomas still recovering from a long-term hip injury, Derrick Rose out for two to three weeks with an ankle sprain, and Iman Shumpert suffering with a knee problem, Lue has been forced to rely on the 36-year-old Calderon. But there has been good news for Lue and  the Cavs this week.
On Sunday,  Thomas stepped up his rehab. Despite being part of the sensational trade of the summer that saw him head to Cleveland while  Kyrie Irving went the other way, the 28-year-old is yet to take to the court in a Cavs jersey.
He has been recovering from a torn labrum in his right hip, but took part in an offensive drill on Sunday that he described to Cleveland.com as the “hardest I’ve run” during rehabilitation. He said afterward that it “felt good for the most part.”
Officially, Thomas is not meant to be available for the team until the new year. The two-time All Star’s progress will please Lue, but Thomas insists he won’t be rushing back.

“I'm protecting myself, so even if they wanted me to hurry back, I'm not going to hurry back, just because I've got a long career ahead of me and an important summer as well,” Thomas told  Cleveland.com.
“I've got to make sure I'm 100 percent healthy before I step out on the floor. But these guys have not rushed me one bit. They've taken their time with me and I appreciate that. Because most teams, they want you out there, especially if things aren't going well.”
So, for Monday, Calderon will stand in at point guard, a situation Lue fully expected. “We knew at some point we were going to need him,” the Cavs' head coach said, as quoted by  ESPN. “He’s a great veteran to have. He gives us steady minutes, and once he gets a feel and gets comfortable out there, I think he'll be great.”
The Cavs are up to fourth in the East after going on a four-game winning run that featured victories against the Clippers, Hornets, Knicks and Mavericks. Monday night’s opponents, the Pistons, may have been beaten twice in the last three games but they’re second behind the Celtics.
Thomas’s former team is on a 15-game winning run and leading the East with ease so far. His new team will be counting the days until Thomas is back.


If the definition of insanity is trying the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result (an oft-repeated aphorism of questionable provenance, one must add)—then consider the Buffalo Bills insane. Possibly.
By now, pretty much the whole of the football-watching world knows that the Bills and Sean McDermott made a personnel decision on Sunday that will go down as one of the more inept in modern NFL history. McDermott, the rookie head coach, benched his dual-threat quarterback Tyrod Taylor for another rookie, Nathan Peterman, for the Bills’ trip to the Los Angeles Chargers. Since the Bills moved to 5-2 on October 29 by beating the Oakland Raiders at home, their pursuit of an AFC Wild Card spot has skidded alarmingly into the long grass.
McDermott’s team lost to the Jets at MetLife Stadium, then got blown out by the Saints in upstate New York last week. To be fair to Taylor, who was under center for each of those losses, the latter result seems to be happening to most teams lately. Taylor’s insecurity may also be compounded by his status as one of the NFL’s harder-to-define quarterbacks. He takes care of the ball and makes LeSean McCoy a better player, but the knock on Taylor has been that he doesn’t take enough risks throwing the ball downfield. "Are you going to win a Super Bowl with Tyrod Taylor?" does feel more than a little like, "Are you going to win a Championship with Alex Smith?" Maybe it’s just a coincidence that the Chiefs, too, have hit the buffers in recent weeks. A “game manager” can be great, but every single facet of the team around them needs to be working well at the same time for it to contend.
That’s enough, though, of defending McDermott. Peterman turned the ball over five times against the Chargers, who led 40-10 at halftime. The fifth-round draft pick out of Pittsburgh completed one more pass than he had interceptions. The game already having disappeared into the distance, McDermott benched Peterman for Taylor, who promptly threw a touchdown and didn’t turn the ball over—albeit in a second half that was all garbage time thanks to Peterman’s nightmare. Hilariously, or tragicomically, the Chargers were so far ahead that they could take Philip Rivers out of the game and put in Kellen Clemens for several snaps toward the end.
Has McDermott learned, then, that a conservative quarterback might actually be a nice thing to have, especially when his offense is geared toward McCoy and the running game? Not really—it seems like the Bills could give Peterman another start next Sunday, against the Chiefs at Arrowhead Stadium. "This is about not only winning now, but also in the future," McDermott told  Joe Buscaglia of WKBW. Mike Rodak of  ESPN reported that McDermott planned to “evaluate” his quarterback situation before the visit to the Chiefs.
That doesn’t sound like he is certain about going back to Taylor. The Bills could yet blow a Wild Card place by sticking with a guy who threw five picks in his first game. Football can be weird.


“Blake Griffin is soft. Like the soft serve. You could put a chocolate coating on top and it gets even softer underneath.”
Those are the words of Raja Bell, a former NBA journeyman who later joined the Cleveland Cavaliers front office, in January 2016 as he discussed the Los Angeles Clippers' power forward. Accusations like this had followed the 2009 No.1 overall pick ever since he joined the team.
The perception of Griffin, over the years, was that he wouldn’t respond or retaliate to aggressive play. The only danger was he'd send a death stare in the direction of row Z. In 2013, Charles Barkley tried to give Griffin some advice. “Blake Griffin, I like you a lot,” he said. “You seem like a nice kid. [But] you gotta stop these guys from hitting on you. Shaq [O’Neal] is a perfect example. At some point Shaq stopped [and said], ‘y’all can’t keep hitting on me because I’m a big guy,’ and, Blake, I’m telling you now, you gotta say I’m gonna be hitting y’all back.”
And, after this weekend, Barkley might be inclined to share the same advice with Lonzo Ball. On Friday night, a scuffle broke out at Staples Center between Kentavious Caldwell-Pope and Tyler Ulis in the fourth quarter of the Phoenix Suns’ 122-113 win over the  Los Angeles Lakers. But instead of Caldwell-Pope and Ulis, the focus after the game was on how Ball, the 20-year-old rookie, reacted.

A clip of the incident was published on social media, showing Ball turn his back and walk away from the scuffle while all of his teammates rushed over. Asked about what happened after the game,  Ball said: “It’s the NBA. People ain’t really gonna fight, so I ain’t trying to get no tech.”
Take a look:

Ball would rather the focus be on his achievements from the weekend, after he registered a triple-double in the Lakers 127-109 win over the Denver Nuggets on Sunday night. He finished the game with 11 points, 11 assists and a career-high 16 rebounds.
It was Ball’s second triple-double of the season, becoming just the second rookie in Lakers history to post more than one, along with Magic Johnson. His 16 rebounds are the most by a rookie this season and since 2000, according to  ESPN.
Ball’s first triple-double came during a loss at Milwaukee earlier this month. “This one is a lot better," he said. “I actually like this one. Just [need to] keep building on it.”
But Ball may also need to build on his reputation now. He wouldn’t want the league to think he’s a soft target—just ask Blake Griffin.


May 8, 2012, Anfield, and Kenny Dalglish’s Liverpool is looking for revenge over Roberto Di Matteo’s Chelsea after being knocked out of the FA Cup the previous weekend.
And they get it, resoundingly. Goals from Jordan Henderson and Daniel Agger followed a Michael Essien own-goal to put the hosts 3-0 up at half-time. Brazilian Ramires gave  Chelsea a pang of hope by bundling in from close range five minutes into the second half but Ross Turnbull’s poor clearance saw Jonjo Shelvey score from distance to win the game 4-1.
Why should we care about this now? But for an emphatic victory that may be remembered by those in the Kop there was little significance in the end for both teams. Yet this was the last time the mighty  Liverpool managed to beat  Chelsea at Anfield. Five years and seven attempts have all ended in defeat or stalemate.
The only survivor from both squads is Henderson. Agger is retired. Shelvey is at Newcastle, his third club since leaving Liverpool. Essien now plays in the Indonesian league after stints in Spain, Italy and Greece. And Ramires was one of the big-money-movers to China. The dugouts have seen six different managers since—two at Liverpool and four at Chelsea. Anfield has been a fortress for quite a while, just not for Liverpool when  Chelsea is in town.

Klopp has actually rather preferred the reverse fixture. His was one of only two teams to beat Chelsea at Stamford Bridge last season in 24 games. The year before, the German orchestrated a 3-1 win in west London in just his second game in charge of the team. 
But this weekend the Blues travel to Anfield, once again. On Saturday, Antonio Conte’s title winners make the 200-mile trip north and they’re back to their formidable best. A 4-0 win over West Brom on Saturday followed the tactical masterclass against Jose Mourinho’s Manchester United before the international break, which ended 1-0.
But Liverpool, too, goes into the game high on confidence. The big criticism of Klopp’s team this season has been its inability to defend, examples being compared to Sunday league football. Yet that gaping hole seems to have been somewhat plugged. Only once has Liverpool defense been beaten in six hours of play, which came against West Ham when the points were already won.
Klopp also has a man with a point to prove in his team. Mohamed Salah was, possibly, the surprise package of the summer transfer window, deemed one of the more savvy buys. Liverpool was willing to pay a club £39.9 million (about $48.9 million) for the Egyptian winger, despite his less than convincing time at Stamford Bridge.
Salah ended up featuring just 13 times in a Chelsea shirt over two seasons after the club bought him from FC Basel in 2014. But he has been no flop for Klopp. Salah already has 14 goals in 18 appearances for Liverpool this season, reaching a tally by November that none of his teammates have managed in the previous two campaigns.
He is a completely different player to the one Mourinho discarded at Chelsea three years ago, but he will be keen to inflict defeat on his previous employers. It has been five long years for the Anfield faithful as well. They’ll be sat in the Kenny Dalglish Stand willing him to help end a record that lasts back to his reign.


Czech tennis player Jana Novotna, a Wimbledon champion in 1998 and 16-time grand slam winner in doubles and mixed doubles, has died at the age of 49 after a long battle with cancer, the Women’s Tennis Association said Monday.
Novotna, who entered the tennis Hall of Fame in 2005, died surrounded by her family in the Czech Republic, the WTA said.
In a career spanning 14 years on the professional circuit that included 24 WTA singles titles and 76 doubles titles, Novotna finally won her only singles grand slam at Wimbledon in 1998 after losing in the final in 1993 and 1997.
She won the hearts of fans around the world when she burst into tears after throwing away victory against Steffi Graf in the 1993 final when on the verge of victory and was consoled afterwards by a British duchess.
“Jana was an inspiration both on and off court to anyone who had the opportunity to know her. Her star will always shine brightly in the history of the WTA,” WTA Chief Executive Steve Simon said in a statement.
Novotna was a three-time Olympic medalist and a member of Czechoslovakia’s 1988 Fed Cup championship team.
“She always supported us from the stands when she could. We will miss her,” the Czech Fed Cup team said on its Facebook page.


You know that trope, surely, repeated through the fight game’s history of pugilists going on too long? Of the old warhorse lured out of a comfortable retirement by the bright lights—and the dollar, too, and that one final promise of late-career glory…
Yeah, so, let’s talk about Jay Cutler and how said trope applies to NFL quarterbacks, too. Cutler was the major casualty of the Miami Dolphins’ horrible 30-20 loss to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on Sunday. The 34-year-old was taken out of the game at halftime and has been placed in the league’s concussion protocol, according to  NFL.com. Cutler, who was replaced by Matt Moore, had already thrown three interceptions and completed six of 12 passes for 83 yards when he was withdrawn.
A reminder that Cutler doesn’t have to do any of this, whether that’s throwing picks or getting his brain beaten around behind a leaky offensive line, or attempting to compensate, however ineptly, for a defense that cannot hold up its end of the bargain by staying off the field for any length of time. He could have been surveying the field from a broadcast booth as part of a three-person  Fox Sports broadcast team alongside Kevin Burkhardt and Charles Davis. Cutler only signed up to be an NFL color commentator in May, after he was released by the Bears. Then Ryan Tannehill broke and the Dolphins came calling with a fully guaranteed $10 million contract, plus incentives, and the chance to work with Adam Gase again and, well, it must have seemed a good idea at the time…
That the Dolphins have been icky isn’t all Cutler’s fault. It seemed the front office was planning for next season already when it traded Jay Ajayi, the Pro Bowl running back, to the Eagles at the end of October for a fourth-round draft pick. (Ajayi had a big day in the Eagles’ blowout of the Cowboys on Sunday, including a career-long run of 71 yards). It isn’t Cutler’s fault that only Ndamukong Suh on the Dolphins’ defense seems to be playing up to his talent level.
Still, Cutler hasn’t been "good," or even good enough to justify giving up the relative comfiness of the broadcast booth. He’s thrown 13 touchdowns against nine interceptions for a total QBR of 36.4, according to the statistics and metrics  ESPN compiles. That’s good enough for 27th in the league among starting quarterbacks, above Joe Flacco, C.J. Beathard, Brian Hoyer, Trevor Siemian and DeShone Kizer. Flacco apart—and he hasn’t really been all that good since the Ravens won a Super Bowl in 2013—those really aren’t names you want to be competing with for futility.
If Cutler were hoping that this season might burnish a legacy that flits awkwardly between unfulfilled and mediocre then it hasn’t gone to plan. It also seems unfortunate that up in the CBS broadcast booth, Tony Romo continues to be one of the best surprises of this year so far. Romo was also, pretty inarguably, a better quarterback than Cutler. Heck, he would almost certainly do a better job for a team now if he came out of retirement.
But then, Romo always was a pretty good decision-maker on the field. As Cutler contemplates a recovery from concussion, maybe there is a gentle lesson in Romo’s new career in learning how to stay retired.


Bring a spare pair of earplugs, because Donald Trump versus LaVar Ball is going to be loud. Like, tooth-shatteringly, earth-shatteringly loud.
The president spent much of the late summer and early fall feuding with the NFL and Colin Kaepernick over the issue of kneeling during the national anthem in protest of police brutality against minorities. But since that dispute seems to have gone down to a gentle simmer—and it wouldn’t be a Trump presidency without a very public argument involving U.S. sports—the president has now become embroiled in a tit for tat with one of America’s most famous basketball families.
To recap: LiAngelo Ball, the UCLA freshman, landed back in Los Angeles on Tuesday after he and teammates Cody Riley and Jalen Hill had been arrested and questioned in Hangzhou, China, on suspicion of shoplifting (all three have been “suspended indefinitely” by UCLA, according to a  USA Today report published on Friday). Trump, who talked about the case with Chinese President Xi Jinping when visiting Beijing last week, tweeted on November 15, “Do you think the three UCLA Basketball Players will say thank you President Trump? They were headed for 10 years in jail!” LiAngelo, Riley and Hill subsequently did thank Trump for their release in a press conference later that same day.

LaVar, though, took issue with Trump claiming credit for his son’s release. "Who?" Ball asked on Friday in an interview with  ESPN. "What was he [Trump] over there for? Don't tell me nothing. Everybody wants to make it seem like he helped me out."
Sure enough, Trump fired back with his own retort on Sunday. “Now that the three basketball players are out of China and saved from years in jail, LaVar Ball, the father of LiAngelo, is unaccepting of what I did for his son and that shoplifting is no big deal. I should have left them in jail!” Trump  tweeted. He followed that up around six hours later with another post again suggesting that he should have left LiAngelo in jail. “Shoplifting is a very big deal in China, as it should be (5-10 years in jail), but not to father LaVar,” Trump  wrote. “Should have gotten his son out during my next trip to China instead. China told them why they were released. Very ungrateful!”
Almost lost in the brouhaha was another peak in a wildly inconsistent rookie season for Lonzo Ball, LaVar’s eldest son. Lonzo had his second triple-double of the season for the Lakers in a win against the Denver Nuggets at Staples Center on Sunday. Unfortunately for the quiet, studious Lonzo, it wasn’t the most noteworthy thing to happen to the Ball family over the weekend. LaVar versus Trump almost certainly isn’t over yet. Prepare for more bellowing, both literal and electronic, from two of America’s loudest individuals.


With the financial might that Real Madrid possesses, the club is used to getting its own way in the transfer market. But when it comes to Harry Kane, money might just not be enough.
The  Tottenham striker has proven to be one of the best hitmen in Europe, with a prolific record that compares to the likes of Barcelona’s Lionel Messi and Real Madrid’s own Cristiano Ronaldo.
Following Spurs’ 3-1 victory over  Real at the beginning of November, there has been increased interest in Kane from the Santiago Bernabeu. Former club president Ramon Calderon told  Newsweek  his successor Florentino Perez would be looking into ways Real could sign the England striker.
But it seems Kane is happy where he is. "My goal is to play my entire career only for Tottenham," he told German newspaper  Bild.

"We have a fantastic team, a great coach, a professional training centre and we're getting a new stadium. At the moment, everything suits me here and I'm happy."
Tottenham has been the main challenger to the Premier League champion over the past two seasons—Leicester in 2016 and Chelsea the following year. Pochettino’s team may wear white but, so far, it has always just been the bridesmaid.
The victory over Real was seen as a step forward for the team, ready to compete seriously in Europe. But it also brought interest from Spain in not only Kane, but also Pochettino and Dele Alli. Tottenham is a team on the ascent but many fear its impressive work could see the club dismantled.
Saturday’s 2-0 defeat to rival Arsenal was also a sobering result for the lilywhite side of north London. It pointed out Pochettino’s poor record away against the so-called “top six” that has included nine defeats, six draws and only one win.
If Tottenham and Pochettino are going to continue this improvement, they’ll need to hang on to the likes of Kane. Fortunately for them, it seems he’s going nowhere.


The January transfer window offers teams the chance to bolster their squads: either by buying the striker that will save them from relegation and propel them into the top four, or bring in the defender that will plug the gap in the defense and prevent them from sliding down the table.
But this year there are concerns in the Premier League that it may well spell the end for the title race. Many believe that it is already over, with  Manchester City holding an eight-point lead after just 12 games and undefeated all season.
Despite spending more than £200 million in the summer, Pep Guardiola has plans to make his squad even stronger. According to the  Daily Mirror, the Spanish coach wants to bring in Southampton center-back Virgil van Dijk and Schalke midfielder  Leon Goretzka.
Both players have drawn interest from a variety of clubs in the Premier League. Goretzka is out of contract in the summer and could be available on a free or cheap transfer, while Van Dijk even went to the extent of handing in a transfer request in the summer.

With the like of Sergio Aguero, Gabriel Jesus, Kevin De Bruyne, Leroy Sane and the rest of City’s army of attacking players providing the goals, Van Dijk would provide the assurance in defense. An experienced head next to the continually improving John Stones.
City will face competition from  Liverpool for both Van Dijk and Goretzka, according to the report. Jurgen Klopp made attempts to sign Van Dijk in the summer, but the club ended up having to apologize to Southampton. But it looks like Liverpool is back now.
Klopp’s team is fifth in the table, and will be wary of missing out on the Champions League positions—the top four teams qualify for the most prestigious competition in European club football. Liverpool’s problem over the past few years has been its inability to defend, keeping just four clean sheets this season.
Van Dijk would, no doubt, provide a classy band aid to the back four at Anfield, and the rest of the league will be rooting for Liverpool. With Van Dijk added to the team, Guardiola’s City would be even more certain of lifting the trophy in May.


With their respective stadiums just five miles apart in North London, Arsenal and Tottenham represent one of the most bitter rivalries in English football.
For most of the last century, Tottenham—most often referred to simply as Spurs—has played underdog to its neighbor, Arsenal, only managing victory in 62 of the 193 matches played between the clubs.
But over the past two years that trend has been reversed. Arsenal, long the richer and more successful of the two clubs, has not won the Premier League—English football’s highest honor—in 13 years. Meanwhile, Spurs have seen a raft of new investment and a successful run that saw them finish only a point behind Arsenal in the 2015-16 season and a healthy 11 points above them last year, narrowly missing out on winning the league title.
As the hoardings that surround White Hart Lane—the Tottenham ground that is currently undergoing an £800 million renovation, prompting the club to play its home games at England's national stadium Wembley—boldly claim ‘There’s something stirring in North London.’

At the Coach and Horses, a pub just a few hundred yards from the stadium and the pre- and post-match watering hole for many diehard Spurs fans, owner Steve Brandon, 57, explains the roots of the rivalry between the two clubs.
“It’s simple, you are either brought up as a Spurs fan or you are brought up to be an Arsenal fan,” he tells  Newsweek, nodding towards a wall of the pub covered head-to-toe in Spurs flags. Brandon, who has been a season ticket holder all his adult life, says that whatever the individual fortunes of Arsenal and Tottenham, the North London derby— as matches between two regional rivals are dubbed in England—will be important: “It’s important to win and have the bragging rights,” he says.
Arsenal fans are rarely not reminded by their rivals that of the two North London clubs, Spurs was there first. Arsenal moved from South East London to Highbury, its former stadium in North London, in 1913, instantly creating friction with Tottenham. It is an animosity that has been passed down through generations: From the playground to the pub to the terraces when the clubs meet on match day.
In the modern era, it has been Arsenal that has dominated, going unbeaten against Spurs at home for 16 years between 1993 to 2009. At the peak of its success in 2004—during the club’s so-called ‘invincible’ season—Arsenal won the Premier League title at White Hart Lane, the ultimate insult to Spurs.
But over a decade later, the two rivals have been heading in opposite directions, with Arsenal only managing one victory over Spurs in the last six meetings. Tottenham is also exceeding expectations in the European Champions League this season group stage, having beaten back-to-back winners Real Madrid at home and holding them to a draw in Spain, while Arsenal failed to secure a spot in the tournament for the first time since manager Arsene Wenger’s tenure began 21 years ago. That failure only added to calls for his resignation.
The Little Wonder Cafe opposite Arsenal's Emirates Stadium in Holloway, North London   Will Thompson
Little surprise, then, that in the shadow of the mighty Emirates Stadium in Holloway ahead of the North London Derby on Saturday, the atmosphere is muted at best. In the Little Wonder Cafe, filled with Arsenal memorabilia including signed shirts and photos, lifelong season ticket holder Stephen Fagg, 64, is despondent.
“I think Tottenham have progressed, Arsenal have stood still or even gone backwards,” said Fagg, who has been watching Arsenal since 1966. “Spurs are a better side.”  
It is a painful thing for an Arsenal fan to admit, but Fagg sees Arsenal’s problems as running all the way from the top, with a chief executive who never leaves his office, a chairman who is more interested in making a profit, and the stubborn manager who refuses to listen to anyone.
Like many Arsenal fans, he bemoans the preference of part-owner Stan Kroenke and Chairman Chips Keswick to treat the club like a business, while doubt about Wenger at the helm remains a recurring theme.
At The Tollington Arms, voted "Best Arsenal Pub" in 2014, Kevin Herron, 53, echoes these concerns. He has supported Arsenal for 34 years since moving to London in 1983, and puts the blame for their recent performance firmly at Wenger’s door.
“Arsene Wenger has been there a bit too long, got a bit complacent. He’s too old, he’s past it,” he says, shaking his head glumly.
Herron, who lives on the doorstep of the Emirates Stadium, says not only has the life been sapped from his club, but fans are expected to pay more and more for the privilege of watching it.
For the cheapest season ticket at the Emirates this year, fans pay £891, more expensive than any other team in the Premier League; Spurs on the other hand, only charge £695 for their equivalent.
“They’re the most expensive tickets in the world but they’re not a world class team anymore,” he says.
Stubborn as ever, Wenger does not share the skepticism of the fans, insisting at a press conference on Thursday that it will be Arsenal’s performance on the pitch that should settle the question. But with Spurs stars Harry Kane, Dele Alli and Harry Winks all set to return on Saturday, Tottenham fans will relish the thought of terrorising Arsenal’s defence, leaving the red half of North London hoping to avoid humiliation yet again at the hands of their neighbors.
Herron, nursing a pint in the Tollington Arms, is not looking forward to the clash: “We used to turn up and smash Tottenham for fun, but the balance of power has changed in the last four or five years, big time,” he says.
“It’s always good to beat Tottenham but I don’t think we’re going to beat them this weekend. I have a horrible feeling we’re going to get spanked, not just beat I mean hammered!”

Fagg, gazing up at at the Emirates stadium over his coffee, is a little more circumspect: “Time will tell,” he says, “but it doesn’t look good.”
If recent results are anything to go by, it certainly doesn’t. Arsenal’s domination of football in this section of London has been uncertain for some time, but Saturday could mark the final shift into a new era—one with a white heart.


It didn’t matter, in the end, that Giancarlo Stanton’s Miami Marlins finished six games below .500 in the 2017 Major League Baseball season.
Or, at least, it didn’t matter for Stanton on Thursday night, as he picked up the National League M.V.P. award for a summer spent slugging his way into the MLB record books.
Sport exists at the same time in different temporal realities, of course, just as individual feats and aims can diverge from the successes and hopes of the collective. So yes, the Marlins finished the season with 85 losses—good, just about, for second in the National League East, where only the Nationals ended with a winning record.
Stanton scorched 59 home runs, coming within one solid connection on the final day of the season of a mark that should not still be reachable by a mortal. In one collective sense, those homers were futile. The Marlins didn’t make the playoffs. But they would have been even further away without Stanton, whose W.A.R. (Wins Above Replacement) of 7.56 was good for fourth in MLB.
In fifth for W.A.R. was Joey Votto, the Cincinnati Reds first baseman who finished as NL M.V.P. runner-up behind Stanton.
“Votto is one of the three National League MVP finalists, and that seemed to catch some by surprise,” David Schoenfield wrote for  ESPN before the award was decided. “One national TV host was foaming like a rabid dog about Votto finishing that high in the voting, and not just because the Reds finished 68-94. You can debate whether the Reds’ bad record hinders Votto’s consideration for MVP, but you can’t debate his value on the field.”
If Stanton is a different case—an unsurprising M.V.P. winner on an average rather than a terrible team—then it’s mostly down to the visceral nature of his feats. Baseballs consistently launched with a rifle crack into the ether are hard for anyone to ignore, particularly if they have a live national television audience. Sometimes you can transcend your team by such a distance that their averageness makes you glisten all the more.

It's not true, however, that Stanton is indifferent to the Marlins' collective achievements. He told  ESPN on Thursday that he wants the team's pitching to be "thoroughly addressed, not just somewhat addressed.”
The game’s preeminent slugger has also made no clear noises that he wants to leave Miami. But the irony at the heart of the matter is that the Marlins, now under Derek Jeter’s co-ownership and intending to slash their payroll for 2018, almost certainly cannot contend while lugging around Stanton’s giant contract.
"It's an interesting feeling and situation for me,'' Stanton said in that ESPN piece. "This is the only place I've known, but I also understand the business part of it. The direction that new ownership wants to go. They're feeling it out. We're going to try to figure out a plan here.''
The ideal, perhaps—or a version of it—would be for Stanton’s temporal reality to match his team’s. That means being traded to a contender, or a team on the verge of contending. One such destination could be the St. Louis Cardinals, who “officially discussed” a potential move with the Marlins on Wednesday according to  Jon Morosi of MLB Network  and Fox Sports.
“The Reds are wasting the Ted Williams of our generation,” read the headline of Schoenfield’s ESPN piece about Votto.
And that does matter, because when greatness is transcribed into annals and histories it requires a wider context than the cult of the individual. Or, to put it another way: it would be a damned shame never to watch Stanton playing baseball in October.


For the first time ever, Nigeria will be represented in the Winter Olympics after the women’s bobsled team qualified for the 2018 Winter Games in PyeongChang, South Korea. Driver Seun Adigun, brakemen Ngozi Onwumere and Akuoma Omeoga completed the fifth out of the five required qualifying races on Wednesday and became the first African team ever to qualify in the bobsled category, ESPN reported.
The all-female squad, led by Adigun, a former African 100-meter hurdles champion and 2012 summer Olympian, completed the qualifying races in Utah and Canada on Tuesday and Wednesday.
“This is a huge milestone for sports in Nigeria,” driver Adigun told KweséESPN. “Nothing makes me prouder than to know that I can play a small role in creating opportunities for winter sports to take place in Nigeria.“Our objective now is to be the best representation of Africa that the Winter Olympics have ever witnessed.”

Solomon Ogba, president of the Bobsled and Skeleton Federation of Nigeria, was thrilled with the team’s achievement and commended the women for their “personal dedication and commitment.” “I have watched them train and work hard to represent Nigeria at the Winter Olympics in a very technical and high-risk sport, and they have achieved that,” he said in a statement. “They should be very proud, and I am very proud of them.”
Bobsledding is a winter sport in which crews of two or four teammates make timed runs down narrow, twisting, iced tracks in a gravity-powered sled.
Driver Simidele Adeagbo, who is also from Nigeria, is two races away from securing another spot at the games for the country, for the Skeleton competition. Skeleton is a single-rider winter sport in which a person rides a skeleton bobsled down a frozen track while lying face down.
The winter Olympics will begin on February 9 and will be broadcasted live for everyone’s viewing pleasure across the United States.


With the international break over, Manchester United returns to Premier League action this weekend with Newcastle United the visitor to Old Trafford.
The old foes  José Mourinho and Rafael Benitez will go head-to-head once again in the dugout, renewing a rivalry made famous during Mourinho’s first stint in  English football when he was at Chelsea and Benitez at Liverpool.
While keen to beat his old rival,  Mourinho will be desperate not to lose any more ground on league leader Manchester City. Pep Guardiola’s team is already eight points ahead after 11 games.
After being hit with a lengthy list of injuries,  Mourinho believes the best of his team is yet to come. "We have the group of players which are the ones that we hope will recover as soon as possible," Mourinho told MUTV earlier this month. “I think we can go into this part of the season, the Christmas period, and after, in a strong position."

Among the long-term injuries were Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Marouane Fellaini, Paul Pogba, Michael Carrick and Marcos Rojo. So, after the international break, has that list got longer or will Mourinho have more to choose from?
According to  The Sun, both Ibrahimovic and Pogba could be available as early as Sunday. Ibrahimovic’s return would be far earlier than expected, having been out since May and not expected to return until 2018.
“He is a lion, he is a fighter,” Mourinho told  Sky Sports. “I think that is a good description of him, he has the anger all the time and that's the reason why he's almost coming back.
“As we expect, he's reduced the timing of his recovering and, as we were saying a few weeks ago, he will be back in 2017, which is a magnificent recovery.”
Pogba has not played since September 12 due to a hamstring strain, while Rojo has been out for seven months with an ACL injury but returned to action for the under 23s this week.
The fitness of Phil Jones is uncertain after he limped out of England’s 0-0 draw with Germany after less than half an hour. Mourinho criticized Gareth Southgate’s decision to play the center-back.
“I don’t think it is possible for a player with a problem to play in a friendly,” Mourinho said, as quoted by the  Daily Mirror.
“Of course, Phil Jones had a problem. He was having a problem for three weeks, he’s having problems that are stopping him to play for his club and then he plays for his club in extreme conditions [in their final match before the internationals] because it’s a big match against Chelsea.
“And then he goes to the national team and he comes home with an ongoing injury that everyone knows is an ongoing injury.”
Fellaini featured in the 1-0 defeat to Chelsea prior to the international break while Carrick has stepped up his training regime and may be in contention.


At Joel Embiid’s current rate of production, his contract could end up looking like the biggest steal in professional sports.
Embiid, the Cameroon-born center who has struggled with injuries to the extent that he’d played only 31 NBA games before the start of the 2017-18 season, exploded offensively against the Lakers on Wednesday night, scoring 46 points to go along with 15 rebounds, seven assists and and seven blocks.
As ridiculous as this outburst was Embiid’s post-game assertion that he is playing at 69 percent (and that is ridiculous mostly because it’s probably true). Also ridiculous: He’s earning less money this year than Markelle Fultz.
That is ridiculous but not odd, once you remember that Embiid was drafted only third overall in 2014, and the rookie pay scale has obviously steepled since then. He’s now in the final year of that deal, which will net him $6.1 million, according to  Spotrac.com.
Because Embiid can do the kinds of things he did on Wednesday night—he just hasn’t been able to do them with any kind of consistency since he was drafted—the 76ers gave him a league-maximum contract extension that could eventually go beyond $148 million, according to  NBA.com. Embiid will earn $25.25 million in 2018-19, rising to $33.33 million in 2022-23 before he becomes an unrestricted free agent.
So the 76ers—who look like they could be playoff-bound, sitting at 8-6 following that Embiid-powered win over the Lakers—find themselves in a strange situation with their multi-talented big man. If Embiid keeps having monster games like Wednesday night’s effort, and if he keeps looking like the NBA’s best center by averaging 23 points per game, then the franchise has an exceptional contract for this season and very good ones for the next few years. Had Embiid’s extension kicked in this year, he would be the 15th best-paid player in the NBA, in between Jrue Holliday and Kevin Durant. (Durant took less money than he could have to keep the Golden State Warriors’ core in place.)
Embiid will be, by some distance, the best-paid center in the league, ahead of the Charlotte Hornets’ Dwight Howard. That kind of money demands production, of course—not 46 points a night, every night, but consistent scoring over a long period of time. For all his brilliance, and the promise of more to come, Embiid has yet to produce while remaining free from injury over a whole season. The 76ers front office may be jumping around joyfully on nights like Wednesday, but it won’t be breathing easily until it has that kind of evidence for a much longer duration.


Lonzo Ball’s start to life with the Los Angeles Lakers hasn’t gone quite as planned.
After all the hype around the 20-year-old rookie—much of which was created by his father LaVar—Ball has seen one side of his game truly stand out, but for all the wrong reasons.
Ball, the No. 2 overall pick, has struggled around the rim. More than struggled, in fact. He is shooting 31.3 percent from the field and 25 percent from the three-point range, both the worst of any qualified shooter in the NBA.
The Lakers are down in 11th in the Western Conference with a record of 6-9 and currently on a one-game losing streak after being beaten by the Philadelphia 76ers and, in particular, Joel Embiid and his 46 points on Wednesday night.
Ball managed just two points, five rebounds and two assists, missing all six of his three-point attempts. And he only played for 21 minutes with coach Luke Walton deciding to leave him on the bench for the entire fourth quarter.

Speaking after the game, as quoted by Tania Ganguli of the  Los Angeles Times, Walton said he went to Ball less because he’d had an “off night.” Walton said Ball’s poor shooting was affecting the rest of his game but insisted he was, in most games, impacting in other ways by running the offense.
Ball has already addressed his rough shooting form, and says it’s a mental issue. “It’s in my head to be honest,” he said after the loss to the Celtics last week. “I know I can shoot the ball.”
Lakers President Magic Johnson suggested the team will have to address Ball’s shooting but will leave it until the offseason. “We’re not gonna mess with it,” he told  ESPN. “We’re gonna let him shoot and play his game. If after the season, he’s not shooting well, then we’ll sit down with him and say, ‘Hey, let’s maybe look at a different way or let’s try to improve the way you are shooting.’”
Ball was a 41.2 percent three-point shooter at UCLA last year. TNT analyst Charles Barkley described him as “half a player” because of his issues with shooting.
The bottom line is that Lakers have too much invested in the rookie to let the slide go on indefinitely. The only question is when they try to address the problem.


The head coach of any team, in any sport, is always tempted to play his best players the most—and the NBA is no exception.
Last year’s MVP Russell Westbrook is averaging 34.1 minutes per game this season, the second highest on Oklahoma after Paul George at 36.3. At Golden State,  Kevin Durant edges the most time on the court with 34.3 minutes over Klay Thompson on 32.9 and  Stephen Curry on 32.4.
Over in Boston, at the top of the Eastern Conference, the work is being shared out:  Kyrie Irving, Al Horford, Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, and Marcus Smart are all averaging between 30 and 31 minutes per game. But that’s not the case in Cleveland where everything's clearly about one man:  LeBron James.
James is spending more time on the court than any of his rivals, averaging 38.1 minutes per game, whereas not one of his teammates is above 30 minutes per game. In six of the last 14 games he’s played, he has gone over 40 minutes. Quite understandable given his impact on the team but the Cavs are still ninth in the East. The Warriors' Draymond Green doesn’t believe that should be a concern, as the season is still young—but James isn’t anymore and the minutes could burn him out.

“I don't think anyone should be panicking 12 games in, or 13 games in,” Green told  USA Today.  “However, there are some glaring concerns with them. And at the same time, you're missing a 30-point [per game] player [in Isaiah Thomas] on the bench who's hurt. So my concern would be that LeBron is playing so many minutes right now.”
James is not only leading the minutes in his own team but the entire league. In his 15th season, this is the highest mark he’s reached since the 2010-11 season and Green says nobody should be on court so much so early.
“He's super human but eventually his super human powers go away,” he said, “so that would be more of my concern if I'm a Cavs fan or somebody with the Cavs or a player, is like 'Man, he's been playing a lot of 40 minute (nights) and it's only Nov. 12.' But I wouldn't be pressing the panic button just yet. At the end of the day, they know how to win. They've got a guy who knows how to win, so I wouldn't necessarily press the panic button. I would see certain things and I would panic about those certain things, just because…I don't think nobody should be playing 40 minutes a game in November.”
Despite their reliance on the King, the Cavs are on a three-game winning streak. Next up they face the Los Angeles Clippers at the Quicken Loans Arena on Friday.


Imagine a world where Jerry Jones is no longer owner of the Dallas Cowboys.
Odd, isn’t it? It doesn’t quite make sense—like a sentence without a full stop, a novel without a satisfactory denouement, a game that passes without Jay Cutler throwing an interception to a wide-open linebacker…
But it may yet happen. Jones’s feud with his fellow NFL owners and Commissioner Roger Goodell over the terms of Goodell’s looming contract extension has progressed to the point where certain owners have discussed the potential for removing Jones from his position, according to the  Wall Street Journal.
A letter sent by the NFL to Jones’s attorney David Boies on Wednesday described Jones’s conduct in repeatedly attempting to block Goodell’s contract extension, which is decided on by the Compensation Committee of which Jones is a non-voting member, as “Detrimental to the league’s best interests.”
That’s potentially concerning language for Jones, as it appears to tie in with Section 8.13 of Article VIII of the NFL’s Constitution and Bylaws, which states that if Goodell finds an owner, “Guilty of conduct detrimental to the welfare of the League or professional football," he can punish them with a $500,000 fine  or invoke the “Cancellation or forfeiture of the franchise in the League… If such occurs, the affected franchise shall be sold.”
That’s the “nuclear option” for the NFL first floated publicly by  Pro Football Talk on November 12 and picked up again by the  New York Post on Thursday morning. “Basically, if Jones ultimately doesn’t oust Goodell, Jones may need to worry about Goodell ousting Jones,”  PFT wrote. That piece makes clear that the prospect of Jones having to give up the Cowboys remains tremendously unlikely—or at least it did as of last Sunday.

Jones himself laughed off the prospect on Tuesday, telling  105.3 The Fan, “If somebody is asserting that [selling the franchise] or thinking about that kind of thing, they’re not knowledgeable on how things work in the NFL,” as reported by the  Star-Telegram. But it’s clear following Wednesday’s letter that tensions between Jones and the league are hardly at the point of de-escalation.
That raises the possibility—albeit still hazy—of who might want to own the world’s most valuable sports franchise? Jones bought the Cowboys for $140 million in 1989 and by October 2017 he had turned them into an entity worth $4.8 billion. You will need deep pockets, in other words—plus a whole load of intangible chutzpah—to take over the U.S.’s most-recognized, and perhaps most polarizing, professional sports brand. There is no shortage of Texan billionaires who might be interested, although it should be noted, as Bloggingtheboys pointed out in 2014, that Jones's line of succession passes down to his son, Stephen. Of course, if the 'Boys are sold then those succession plans will turn to dust. Perhaps more extraordinary than the likely price, however, is the idea that, one conceivable day, the ‘Boys may no longer be Jerry Jones’s property.


The so-called “top six” may be about to be split rather unevenly: On one side there could be a set of teams described as “the chasing five” and on the other, regularly over the hill and far away, Manchester City.
Pep Guardiola has grown comfortable in England. After a tricky first season in the Premier League, his first campaign in management without any silverware, the Spaniard’s work has come to fruition in a way that is dominating the league.
Just 11 games into the season and City is eight points clear of Manchester United, its closest rival in second. Guardiola’s team is already through to the knockout rounds of the Champions League, and has only failed to win just one of its 17 games this season—a 1-1 draw with Everton back in August.
Guardiola’s contract runs until 2019, which would see him at City for three years as he was with Bayern Munich after four seasons with Barcelona. Manchester City is believed to be just the third stop on his tour of proving himself to be the greatest coach on the continent.
But maybe Guardiola is enjoying himself too much in the Premier League.

According to the  Daily Mail, Guardiola is open to discussing a new deal at the Etihad Stadium that would see him stay with the club past 2019: an ominous prospect for the rest of the league.
This season is expected to see Guardiola add to the 21 trophies he has won in eight seasons as a manager. That run has seen him win the domestic league in six of the eight campaigns, turning his team into the dominating force in both Spain and Germany. That trophy cabinet could see four additions by the end of the season with City still competing in four competitions.
City faces Leicester in the league on Saturday and also faces Claude Puel’s team in the EFL Cup in December. Guardiola is yet to learn who City will face in the FA Cup, and the knockout stages of the Champions League will be drawn after the conclusion of the group stages.
Manchester City will be thrilled to see Guardiola’s interest in staying in the north-west. But what of the new “chasing five”?


Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho is furious at the treatment of Phil Jones during his time with the England squad, according to reports.
Jones played 25 minutes of the 0-0 draw against Germany on Friday but had to be removed due to what  Mourinho called an ongoing injury.
The  United center-back is now unlikely to be available for the visit of Newcastle United to Old Trafford on Saturday, leaving Mourinho frustrated by Gareth Southgate’s decision to play him.
“I don’t think it is possible for a player with a problem to play in a friendly,” Mourinho said, as quoted by the  Daily Mirror.
“Of course, Phil Jones had a problem. He was having a problem for three weeks, he’s having problems that are stopping him to play for his club and then he plays for his club in extreme conditions [in their final match before the internationals] because it’s a big match against Chelsea.

“And then he goes to the national team and he comes home with an ongoing injury that everyone knows is an ongoing injury.”
Jones is one of five key players who have been sidelined for United in recent weeks. Paul Pogba, Marcos Roja and Michael Carrick have all had long-term injuries but are on the verge of a return.
Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who suffered a knee injury last season, is still expected to be out until the new year. But it has become increasingly difficult for Mourinho to complain about this situation.
In October, Mourinho spoke about an observation that “other managers they cry and cry and cry,” a criticism that seemed to be aimed at Chelsea boss Antonio Conte who was frustrated by injuries and a lack of signings in the summer.
Conte hit back. “I think that, a lot of times, Mourinho [likes to concentrate on] what is happening at Chelsea,” he said. “A lot of times, also last season. [He has] to think about his team.”


The Italian Football Federation has approached Carlo Ancelotti to replace Giampiero Ventura as manager after the national team failed to qualify for the World Cup for the first time in 60 years, according to reports.
Italy was beaten 1-0 by Sweden over two legs, failing to score in 120 minutes of the playoff match which means the nation won’t be at the tournament in Russia next year.
Ventura, who replaced Antonio Conte as manager after Euro 2016, is still in the role but he is facing pressure to either resign or be sacked in the next few days. And his successor could be the experienced Ancelotti, according to Italian broadcaster Premium Sport, after the FIGC (Italian Football Federation) made contact with the 58-year-old.

Ancelotti’s two decades in management have largely been spent in Italy, as coach of Juventus and AC Milan, where he won the Champions League twice and Serie A.
He left the San Siro and Italy for the first time in his coaching career after being appointed as Chelsea manager in 2009 by Roman Abramovich. He delivered the Premier League title and FA Cup double but was sacked the following year.
Ancelotti remained away from Italy, winning the Ligue 1 title with Paris Saint-Germain before winning a third Champions League trophy at Real Madrid in 2014.
His latest role came in Germany as manager at Bayern Munich. He won the Bundesliga last season but was sacked in September after a 3-0 defeat to Paris Saint Germain in the Champions League.
Taking charge of the national team may make sense for Ancelotti. He would begin planning for Euro 2020, which will be held across Europe, immediately.
But Italy is clearly not a weak team despite failing to qualify for the World Cup next year. Only last summer, Conte took the Italians to the quarterfinal of Euro 2016 and was only beaten on penalties, having knocked out holders Spain at the last-16 stage.


After Soldier Field witnessed a miserable defeat to a depleted Green Bay Packers on Sunday, some Bears fans have begun calling for the end of the John Fox reign.
Fox’s Bears may have had the more talented quarterback against the Packers for once and they had a defensive unit on the rise. They also had an extra week to prepare for the game. But none of that mattered and they still lost 23-16, and many of the fans have seen enough.
Fox, they say, has to go—and they have found a unique way of expressing this opinion. Across social media, many Bears fans have added a new avatar on their Twitter accounts, adopting the logo of the Firefox web browser by Mozilla.  
It was too easy for the Bears fans; a realisation that the logo reflected their view just perfectly, that Fox’s time at Chicago was done and that he must be fired. Now in his third season as  coach, Fox has a losing record of 12-29 during his time with the team, plus 1-5 against the Packers. 
 
Just my new favorite web browser.
 

The @ChicagoBears came out in the 2nd half of the season just like they come out in the 2nd half of every game under John Fox. Flat, unprepared, undisciplined. His in game coaching is the worst ever. #FireFOX #FireFOX FireFOX #FireFOX #FireFOX #FireFOX pic.twitter.com/I3fevBe7GF
 

While that run may not be entirely his fault, the head coach is usually the fall guy. But Fox’s position still doesn’t appear to be in danger, a view he certainly seems to hold.
Related:   Could Jerry Jones move the Cowboys to Canada?
“I’ve been doing this too long,” he said, as quoted by the Associated Press. “I’ve never worried about my job security, and I won’t start going forward.”
The pressure on Fox seemed to tell on Sunday, though, as he lost his cool with a line judge over a call. But for now, Fox would do well to stay away from social media to vent his anger. And if doesn't, he’ll probably be better off using Google Chrome.

Remember what happened the last time anyone entertained the idea of playing an NFL game on short rest?
It, uh, wasn’t great. The Seahawks and Cardinals scrapped out a pretty horrible contest in the Arizona desert; Russell Wilson got popped under the chin and went off for a concussion check that looked cursory at best and which the NFL is now investigating—ESPN reported on Sunday that the Seahawks  did violate the NFL’s concussion protocol by letting their quarterback back onto the field to orchestrate the win without giving him a proper assessment in the locker room. Other players on both sides also went down with injuries.
Oh, and Richard Sherman snapped an achilles tendon that he said was on the verge of rupturing already, but you know, may not have ruptured had the powers that be given him more than a half-week to recover from the Seahawks’ previous game, a bruising defensive slugfest on FedEx Field turf that can be sapping at the best of times.
You can argue until the cows come home, or until Tom Brady retires, about whether Sherman’s bravery or the NFL’s general attrition rate or the CBA’s banning of two-a-day practices leading to increased susceptibility to injury or a short week or a combination of all of those led to the loss of one of the NFL’s best, and almost certainly its most charismatic, defensive player. But it’s difficult to dispute that the debate around the future of Thursday Night Football is getting hotter as we pass the midway point of the 2017 season.
Ben Roethlisberger, the Steelers quarterback who could never legitimately be questioned for his toughness, said on his weekly radio show this week that playing games on Thursdays was “miserable” and “terrible.” “They need to get rid of this game, I think,” Roethlisberger said in quotes reported by  Jeremy Fowler of  ESPN. “I’m sure everyone who’s played on Thursday night would say the same thing. You’ve got to let your body recover a bit.”
Everyone who has played on Thursday night, maybe, but not Jerry Jones who has never played an NFL game on a Thursday night. The Dallas Cowboys owner—currently engaged in a drag-out fight with his fellow owners and NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell—told 105.3 The Fan that his Cowboys are fine playing on short rest. “Not one shred of statistics show that to be a disadvantage, inordinately challenging physically for the players,” Jones said in quotes reported by the  Star-Telegram. “We’re the poster child of playing on Thursday and, as a result, what it does to the demand for players being rested or being healthy.”
If Sherman’s injury didn’t make the NFL take notice, then Roethlisberger’s comments probably aren’t going to have any effect either. Still, if Thursday night games aren’t facing an existential crisis yet, then it’s clear that the debate over their essential safety isn’t going away anytime fast.


When Gregg Popovich speaks about President Donald Trump, people tend to listen—and, indeed, it seems many decide to respond, too.
Popovich, a 1970 graduate of the Air Force Academy who served five years, has been a frequent critic of the president since he took office in January, describing him as a “soulless coward” and calling “our country an embarrassment to the world.” The  San Antonio Spurs coach is not afraid of taking a pop.
He has made clear his belief that  Trump is a liar and divisive. Many listeners and readers take the time to write to the 68-year-old, some messages of support and others of criticism.  Popovich says he reads everything and tries to respond to them all.
“It takes time because there's a lot of letters,” he said, as quoted by  ESPN. “But the only ones I don't respond to are the ones that are so courageous in their negativity that there's no address, just comments. That's hard to respond to. But there are people who have responded and disagreed, and say, 'Why?' And it's erudite and intelligible. [And I'm like], 'Yeah, you've got a point.' Those people deserve to be written back. So, I try. I probably won't get them all, but I try.”

Asked whether he received a negative reaction from supporters on his political opinions, Popovich joked: “Oh, no, no, no. Every single person has agreed with everything I've said. I get flowers. I get trinkets and gifts.” He added: “Just as you would expect: A little bit of both, right? A lot of both.”
Popovich gave an insight into the kind of messages he had received by suggesting that many didn’t have the kind of western beliefs typical of the United States. But Popovich also explained that he was left more with a feeling of hopefulness after reading the letters.  
“Some responses make you wonder what country you live in, and other responses make you very hopeful,” he said. “But there's a lot more hopeful than, 'My gosh, how did this person come up with this?' So overall, it renews my feeling that something can be done because there are enough people willing to listen and feel and compromise.”
Popovich, according to some high-profile figures in the NBA, should be president instead of Trump. Last month, Golden State Warriors coach Steve Kerr said “he would make a great president.” Steph Curry added: “He’s great for the NBA and would be even better for the country, probably.”
For now, Popovich’s concern is the league. The Spurs are third in the Western Conference with a 9-5 record and on a two-game winning streak, and play the Minnesota Timberwolves on Wednesday.


On Thursday night at TD Garden the NBA’s apparently unstoppable winning streak meets the league’ provably unstoppable offense, when the Boston Celtics host the Golden State Warriors.
Already—and yes, almost certainly prematurely—it feels like a preview of the NBA Finals. The Houston Rockets may yet have lots to say to that in opposition, but their defensive problems were exposed by the Raptors on Tuesday in an eye-opening 129-113 defeat at Toyota Center that snapped a six-game winning streak. It has to be a worry for the Rockets that James Harden can produce 38 points, 11 assists and six rebounds and still end up on the losing side—comprehensively so—against a very good, not-quite-great, team. “Each one of their [the Raptors’] sets down the stretch was run to attack Harden’s statuesque defence,” the  Raptors HQ  blog wrote in its postgame wrapup. Which is to say, the Rockets may have the leading M.V.P. candidate as of November 15, 2017 but they remain unbalanced in the direction of a pyrotechnic offense.
The same cannot be said of the Warriors—or the Celtics. The NBA champions, who have shot to 11-3 after a sluggish start, possess the league’s best offense with an average of 119.57 points per game. The Celtics, meanwhile, extended their streak to 13 wins in a row on Tuesday night by beating the Brooklyn Nets in New York City. Kyrie Irving, returning after missing a game with a minor facial fracture and playing in a mask, scored 25 points and was met throughout by chants of “M.V.P.,” according to  ESPN. For all of the offensive punch that Irving has added, though, it’s the Celtics’ team-orientated defensive efforts that have helped Brad Stevens’s team to the NBA’s best record after 15 games. The Celtics rank first in the league in defensive efficiency, giving up 94.5 ppg according to  ESPN. Irving, in particular, has surprised many reasoned observers with his efforts on defense so far this season. He no longer looks so much like the lavishly gifted but defensively fallible foil to LeBron James that he was in Cleveland.

The Celtics’ early-season excellence has caught the attention of Steve Kerr, the Warriors head coach. "It sure looks like Boston is the team of the future in the East, with the assets that they still have and their young talent and their coaching, and Kyrie [Irving] is amazing," Kerr said after practice on Tuesday in quotes reported by  ESPN.
You could, if you so wished, interpret it as a tangential dig at James’s Cavaliers, who have spluttered to a 7-7 record and sit in the middle of a collection of fringe playoff contenders, at best, in the East. Or you could conclude that there is more realism than snarkiness to Kerr’s comments. It is a fact lost on no one, least of all James, that the Cavaliers have been abysmal defensively so far this season, ranking above only the Nets and the Phoenix Suns in average ppg allowed. With James able to test free agency in the summer of 2018, with Isaiah Thomas still recuperating from hip problems and with a starry but old or infirm supporting cast—Dwyane Wade and Derrick Rose have been problems this season as well as solutions—it feels like without James’s transcendence, the Cavaliers could slip back into the pack. So—again, perhaps a premature conclusion that will return to haunt us—Thursday night in Boston has the feeling of a shift in the NBA’s long-established order.


Cristiano Ronaldo has dropped another bombshell at Real Madrid by telling president Florentino Perez he is “angry” and wants to leave, according to reports.
The four-time Ballon d’Or winner was reportedly looking to leave the  Santiago Bernabeu in the summer after being accused of tax evasion in Spain. The possibility of a return to  Manchester United was considered.
Ronaldo stayed and has a contract until 2021, but now it seems increasingly unlikely that the 32-year-old will remain at the club that long.
According to Edu Aguirre, the Spanish journalist who works for  TV station El Chiringuito, Ronaldo has already told Perez that he wants to leave the club and for a “reasonable price.”
The Portuguese forward believes he is under-appreciated in the Spanish capital, Aguirre says, and is ready to depart after eight years at the club.

Ronaldo joined Real from  Manchester United in 2009 for a then-world record £80 million fee (about $105 million), and went on to battle with Barcelona’s Lionel Messi for the position of the best player in the world.
Ronaldo has won two La Liga titles and three Champions League trophies at the Bernabeu, but has had a tough start to the new season. He has scored just one goal in seven league games while Messi is already on 12.
Reports throughout the summer suggested Ronaldo could return to Old Trafford, where he made a name for himself as a skilfully fast and prolific winger.
Almost a decade on and Ronaldo’s style has changed with age. But fellow countryman  Jose Mourinho, the United manager, has worked with Ronaldo already.
Mourinho was manager at the Bernabeu from 2010 through 2013, leading Ronaldo and Real to one of the two league titles Ronaldo has won at the club. At a reasonable price, Mourinho may be tempted to bring him back to England.
And with Manchester City leading the Premier League table by eight points already, it could be Mourinho’s last move to challenge for the title.


Arsene Wenger is considering taking up international management after leaving Arsenal which could see him lead a nation to the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, according to reports.  
The  Arsenal manager, who is the current longest serving manager in the Premier League by far after 21 years at the club, is now contemplating the next stage of his career.
Some fans at the Emirates Stadium wanted to see the 2016/17 season be Wenger’s last after failing to qualify for the Champions League, but the Frenchman signed a new two-year deal.
At 68, it may end up being  Wenger who decides when he leaves the club. Asked whether he could manage at the 2022 World Cup, he told  beIN Sports : “Maybe, you never know.”

For now, Wenger says he enjoys the constant interaction and work that comes with managing at a club rather than international level, so he is likely to see out his contract at Arsenal.
“Four or five weeks [at the World Cup] is a different experience, it’s more concentrated,” he said.
“But I believe the real experience to manage a team is on a daily basis, I will not always have the physical strength to do that so maybe I will move into that.
“Maybe yes, I will do it at some stage but until now I like to be involved every day in the life of a club, you know because the real test is there.”
Wenger’s Arsenal has won the FA Cup in three of the last four seasons, but a failure to truly challenge for the Premier League title has seen many fans lose faith.
Arsenal did finish second in the league in 2016, but only thanks to a late implosion from rival club Tottenham Hotspur—Wenger’s team was too slow for Claudio Ranieri’s champion Leicester City.
This season, not much has changed. Arsenal is sixth in the Premier League table, last out of the top six clubs in English football, and may face a tough transfer window in the new year.
Alexis Sanchez could leave for a low sum as his contract expires at the end of the season, which is also the case for German playmaker  Mesut Ozil. Ozil is expected to sign a new deal while Sanchez looks likely to join league leader Manchester City.


It’s time for a mid-November hoops scouting report on the Ball brothers of Los Angeles: UCLA freshman LiAngelo Ball is bad at stealing and Lakers rookie Lonzo Ball is bad at shooting.
Last week, Bruin LiAngelo, who is 6’5," was arrested in China, along with 6’10” teammates Cody Riley and Jalen Hill, after the trio allegedly pilfered sunglasses from a Louis Vuitton retail outlet in the city of Hangzhou. (What made them stand out to store security?)
On Monday night, 6’6” Lonzo shot three for 10 from the field in a Lakers’ win at Phoenix to maintain his position as the lowest-rated shooter, in terms of percentage, in the NBA (31.3%). He Got Game, meet He Got Lame. Or more to the point, He Got Fame.

In the past week, while the Balls were making news on either side of the Pacific Rim without being able to consistently locate a specific rim, the family garnered more of what it values most: celebrity. There is already a Facebook reality series, “Ball In The Family,” though a better title may be “Creeping Up On The Kardashians.” On Saturday Night Live, Kenan Thompson impersonated the family patriarch, LaVar Ball, on “Weekend Update,” promoting a new shoe, the “Legendo 20,” in which each sneaker would cost $700,000. “You can only buy them one at a time.”
Parody depends upon hyperbole, of course, but then LaVar’s family business, Big Baller Brand, actually does offer a shoe, the ZO2 Prime Remix, for $695. That’s three times as expensive as the priciest Nike Air Jordan on the market. LaVar, who averaged two points per game at Washington State, has brazenly proclaimed that he could beat that shoe’s namesake in a one-on-one contest.
That’s because truth does not matter to LaVar Ball, only sound bytes do. (Sound like anyone else you know?) After Lonzo scored three points on one-for-six shooting in his NBA debut last month, LaVar hijacked ESPN SportsCenter to mansplain that his eldest son had a “great night.” It may only be a matter of time before Big Baller Brand sells shovels and knee-high waders.

To be fair, LaVar’s progeny (a third sibling, 16-year-old LaMelo, is being home-schooled), are legitimate prodigies. Over the weekend, Lonzo became the youngest player in NBA history to record a triple-double. Last season, LiAngelo averaged 33 points per game at Chino Hills High School, in California, and LaMelo once scored 92 points in a game for that same Chino Hills squad.
Moreover, it is not Lonzo’s, LiAngelo’s or LaMelo’s fault that their pops is a summa cum laude graduate of the Trump University school of attention whoredom, or that, when it came to naming them, LaVar must have been binge-watching Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Lonzo, who just turned 20 a few weeks ago, is already well-versed in pro-speak. After being benched for the entire fourth quarter of the Lakers’ 100-93 win on Monday evening, Lonzo said, “We got a win so I got no complaints.”
Meanwhile, teammate and fellow rookie Kyle Kuzma, whom the Lakers selected with the 27th pick in last summer’s NBA draft—25 spots behind Lonzo—is averaging four more points per game in nearly identical minutes. The most delightful aspect of Kuzma’s game is that no one knows who the hell his father is.

Purely as a shooter, Lonzo is not having a ball. He ranks 124, or dead last, in the NBA among in field-goal percentage as well as dead last (140th) in three-point field-goal percentage. Two weeks ago against Portland he played 28 minutes and finished with zero points; the last time a top-five draft pick played that many minutes and went scoreless was 1992 (Dikembe Mutombo).
“He’s been shooting that way his whole life...so we’re not gonna mess with it,” says Lakers general manager Magic Johnson, who earned five championship rings and induction into the Basketball Hall of Fame with an aesthetically frightful jump shot. “If after the season he's not shooting well, then we'll sit down with him and say, 'Hey, let's maybe look at this a different way.”
Lonzo’s problems are mechanical; LiAngelo’s were criminal, at least until the President of the United States intervened. Donald Trump, who just happened to be visiting Asia when the Vuitton larceny went down, asked his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, to do him a solid by dropping the charges. (Give LiAngelo and his pals this: they have impeccable timing.) By Tuesday morning the three Bruin players were on a flight headed back to California, but not before legendary Bruin great Bill Walton shamed them publicly.

Walton, an outspoken and unfiltered broadcaster, happened to be calling UCLA’s game against Georgia Tech in Hangzhou on Saturday. A devoted pupil of his UCLA coach, John Wooden, who developed the “pyramid of success,” Walton lashed out on the Bruin trio’s pyramid of excess, teeing off his rant at the opening tipoff:
“I am sad, disappointed and embarrassed. This is a very big deal. The noble purpose here has been stained. Our hosts...have done everything right to make this all work. Now, members of our family have displayed an appalling lack of honor, lack of decency, lack of respect, by doing something in someone else’s home that they would never do in their own. And I want to apologize right now on behalf of the human race for this travesty.”
Walton’s son, Luke, by the way, is the Lakers’ head coach. Lonzo’s coach.
“Y’all couldn’t steal nothing!”This clip of LaVar & LiAngelo Ball from their reality show #ballinthefamily is so much funnier now.Via @Ananth_Pandian pic.twitter.com/rVtrwU4Ker
LiAngelo’s arrest left his father speechless, but not for long. Initially LaVar said that he was unable to talk due to “the legal nature of the matter,” but the reality show must go on. Before the weekend was out, before his middle son had been excused from house arrest by the clemency of Chinese president Xi, LaVar told ESPN, “Everyone’s making it a big deal. It ain’t that big a deal.”
LiAngelo Ball is bad at stealing. Lonzo Ball is bad at shooting. And LaVar Ball is forever unable to provide an assist.


There seems to be only one likely winner from Jerry Jones’s decision to take on Roger Goodell and the NFL. And it isn’t the Dallas Cowboys owner.
On Monday, The New York Times reported that several NFL team owners have given Jones, the 75-year-old Californian oil billionaire who bought the Cowboys in February 1989, a “cease and desist warning” as he seeks to block a contract extension for NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell. “The warning to Jones, which was issued by the six owners on the N.F.L. compensation committee after the group held a conference call Monday, comes less than two weeks after he threatened to sue the league and the owners on the committee who have been working for months on a new contract for Goodell,” Ken Belson wrote.
In particular, Jones appears to have irritated Arthur Blank, the Atlanta Falcons owner who chairs the compensation committee that decides the terms of Goodell’s contract. Jones’s threat to sue the other six members of the committee has already seen him thrown out of the group, while Blank responded on Monday with a statement saying, “The committee is continuing its work towards finalizing a contract extension with the commissioner.” “Rather than impede Goodell’s contract extension, Jones has all but ensured it’s going to get done,” Nancy Armour wrote in  USA Today on Monday.
Jones’s power-play could have devastating implications. A  Pro Football Talk piece published on Sunday evening mentioned a so-called “nuclear option” that NFL owners opposed to Jones could take should they find him “Guilty of conduct detrimental to the welfare of the League or professional football.” (Section 8.13 of the NFL’s Constitution and Bylaws). The first option in that case would be a $500,000 fine, but if Goodell deems Jones’s conduct deserving of further punishment then the Cowboys franchise could be “cancelled,” according to league rules, essentially forcing Jones to sell his baby.
That seems  highly unlikely, not least because as much as Jones may be annoying his fellow owners and Goodell, the NFL needs the Cowboys to remain a financial behemoth.  Forbes valued the team at $4.8 billion in October 2017, $1.1 billion million more than the New England Patriots, the NFL’s second most-valuable franchise. The Cowboys made $840 million in revenue in the past year. Blank’s Falcons took in $367 million while the Oakland Raiders, 32nd and last in the league for revenue, made $321 million.
It’s those disparities that make Jones the NFL’s most powerful owner, and mean the Cowboys aren’t going anywhere in the short, medium or long-term future.
But if Jones really wanted to test out how scared the league is of losing the world’s most-valuable sports franchise, couldn’t he employ his own “nuclear” tactic.  Newsweek has explored the possibility for him by sending an email to the Canadian Football League exploring their receptiveness to welcoming in the Cowboys. The CFL has not responded to a request for comment.
Sure, there are potential roadbumps. The CFL salary cap for the 2017 season, for instance, is set at $5,150,000 which is a little less than the NFL’s mark of $167 million.

But we feel confident that if both parties are willing, a deal can be done here. It’s not like the CFL is struggling—a June 2016  ESPN piece noted a reported $40 million  TSN deal running until 2021 that has helped boost the financial health of the league. "We don't have $1 billion teams, and that means we're on our own a bit more; we have to be more entrepreneurial and innovative," Bob Young, owner of the Hamilton Tiger Cats, told  ESPN  at the time. "We really are nine different businesses."
Well, the CFL could have a near $5 billion business if it’s willing to just demolish its salary cap and most other rules that have made it savvy and successful. As for the Cowboys? Jones hasn’t won a Super Bowl since 1996, and he would surely fancy his chances against the Edmonton Eskimos. And is it really any more geographically ridiculous to call the Cowboys a Canadian franchise than make them play in the NFC East? Not really.


When you’re an All-Time Great, there are ways and ways to wake up your slumbering teammates.
You can, if the mood so takes you, have a 57-point night. You can play the post one night, from the point the next, maybe both in one night the night after, to show the underperformers that positions are really kind of ephemeral. And if neither of those, or anything else, works? Well, there’s always a Knicks rookie to pick on.
The Cavaliers-Knicks game in New York on Monday was notably weird for several reasons, not least the actually-pretty-decent Knicks taking a 15-point lead in the fourth quarter against a team still searching for an identity post-Kyrie Irving.
Not so weird: James sparking the comeback and sinking what proved to be the game-winning shot, a three-pointer over Kristaps Porzingis that had Isaiah Thomas dancing on the sidelines and gave the Cavs their first winning streak since the start of the season.
Weird: James’s feud with the 2017 Knicks, which doesn’t seem finished even after he apparently had the last laugh with that game-winning shot on Monday at Madison Square Garden. “James converted an alley-oop with 40.2 seconds left in the first quarter to put the Cavs up by one,”  ESPN’s wrap-up stated. “He immediately crowded [Frank] Ntilikina, bumping his chest into the point guard while Ntilikina tried to free himself up to receive the inbounds pass, causing Ntilikina to shove his forearm back into James.”
James, whose real beef is with former Knicks President Phil Jackson (who called James’s business entourage a “posse” in an interview with  ESPN last year), aimed a barb at the former Bulls head coach on Saturday when he said the Knicks, “passed on a really good one” by selecting Ntilikina ahead of Dennis Smith Jr. with the eighth pick of the 2017 NBA Draft. Enes Kanter, the Knicks’ center, accused James of “disrespect” on Sunday. After Kanter came to Ntilikina’s defence on Monday, he and James had to be separated by the officials. Both were assessed technical fouls.
As reported by the  New York Post, James clarified on Monday that his issues remain with Jackson, not the Knicks or Ntilikina. Maybe—and only tangentially related to his dislike of Jackson—James also felt like he and the Cavaliers needed to manufacture a spark from somewhere to power up a stuttering early season. Picking on a rookie who is actually playing very decent defense—and proved on Monday night that he has the chutzpah to stand up to the harshness of the NBA—may have seemed like a strange way to go about that. But hey, the Cavaliers are 7-7 and, maybe, moving less hesitantly in the right direction. "Well, I'm the King, my wife is the Queen and my daughter's the Princess, so we've got all three covered," James said in response to Kanter’s post-game jab at his nickname. The Knicks remain a game ahead of the Cavaliers in the Eastern Conference standings. But it’s hard not to feel like James will soon be laughing longest and loudest.


Italy won’t be at the 2018 World Cup in Russia next summer.
Say that again, and see how weird it starts to sound in the mouth, on the tongue—in the  heart, damnit.
Italy, the country that practically invented defending as an art, that gave the world one of soccer’s greatest-ever nicknames—“The Divine Ponytail”—to describe the blissful talents of Roberto Baggio; that lent us Andrea Pirlo and his sublime passing and equally sublime hair and an unfair amount of urbanity; that made us laugh and cry at the same time by doing hilarious things like torching itself with self-reproach for a match-fixing scandal then winning the 2006 World Cup a few weeks later; that hosted the World Cup, in 1990, that woke English football from its own period of introspection and torpor.
That inspired the stiff-lipped BBC to become dewy-eyed enough to meld opera and soccer and create  this title sequence that won’t be beaten no matter how good special effects or virtual reality get…

The Italian soccer team of 2017 is a wispy imitation, though, of those in your memory. Sure, they wear the same, lovely  Azzurri  shirts, and they still have great clubs and good players to pick from even if the best, Juventus and Napoli, rely on foreign players for much of their success.
But something—or things—are missing. Hence the calamity, no less, of Monday night, when Sweden visited the San Siro in Milan for the second leg of a World Cup 2018 play-off and walked out with a 0-0 draw and a 1-0 win on aggregate, that of course, and shockingly, meant Italy will not be present at a World Cup for the first time since 1958.
"We will not be with you and you will not be with us. A love so great must be reserved for other things. Italy will not participate at the World Cup,”  La Gazzetta Dello Sport, Italy’s famous pink-paged sports newspaper, wrote on the Tuesday morning after the night before.
"It is time to start thinking about what else we can do in June: concerts, cinema, village festivals. Anything but watching Sweden play at the World Cup—that would be too painful." It was a kind of death that presaged a series: Gianluigi Buffon, one of Italy’s greatest-ever goalkeepers, retired after the game. Daniele De Rossi and Andrea Barzagli, stalwarts both, both exited sheepishly, painfully.
Because Sweden—and here we invite hate-mail from Swedes the world over—is just okay at soccer. It has one, transcendent player in Zlatan Ibrahimovic who doesn’t even play international soccer anymore. Its best club teams would be humiliated by Juventus, Napoli, Roma and Lazio were they even good enough to get into the Champions League and yet…
Italy still lost. The 2018 World Cup was already U.S.A.-less. Now Italian-Americans don’t even have Italy to cheer on. It might be time to take  Gazzetta’s advice and start making alternative plans for June and July next year.


With one cruel pop in the third quarter of a Thursday Night Football game between the Seattle Seahawks and Arizona Cardinals, the NFL watched another of its most marketable players disappear for the season.
"No coming back from that until you get surgery," Seahawks head coach Pete Carroll said of the ruptured achilles suffered by cornerback Richard Sherman in the third quarter of his team’s 22-16 win at University of Phoenix Stadium, in quotes reported by Reuters. "He's [Sherman] been a bastion of consistency, competitiveness and toughness. We're going to miss the heck out of him."
Sherman hadn’t missed a game since entering the NFL in 2011, according to  ESPN. He said his achilles had been bothering him all season. "One of those things that you have to play through for as long as you can. When it goes, it goes,” Sherman said of the injury. "I've put a lot of stress on it. Think it would have gone eventually."
The 29-year-old isn’t just the durable centerpiece of the “Legion of Boom”—one of those rare defensive players you would pay to watch. He’s a bright, charismatic and occasionally controversial figure in a league that tends towards the bland soundbite. Even past their zenith, the Seahawks remain one of the NFL’s most intriguing, engaging franchises.

And now there will be no more Sherman for this season, on the field at least. Like there has been no JJ Watt since October 8 (Watt fractured his tibia on a Sunday night, though). The Texans' defensive end is, like Sherman, a dominant and charismatic defensive presence you pay to watch, and listen to.
There’s no way of knowing, of course, whether Sherman’s achilles would have given way had the Seahawks played the Cardinals on Sunday, off a full week of rest. His teammates—like many in the NFL—have long since made up their minds. "This s*** should be illegal,” Doug Baldwin told  The  Tacoma News Tribune after the Seahawks’ victory. “It is not OK. It’s not OK. You can quote me on that.
“This is not OK.... Absolutely, guys do not have enough time to recover. You can’t recover in four days.” Bobby Wagner, the Seahawks linebacker, called on the NFL to, “Change the format” of Thursday night games, possibly by giving the two teams involved a bye in the runup week.
That  News Tribune  report makes grim reading. “So many Seahawks couldn't walk without significant pain after this Thursday night 'showcase,' about 10 piled onto an equipment cart from all angles outside locker room so they could avoid having to walk to the team bus,” Greg Bell wrote. “Sherman and his crutches plus Pro Bowl defensive end Michael Bennett with his plantar-fascia injury on top of wrecked toe were among them.” Quarterback Russell Wilson briefly left the game to be evaluated for a hit to the head, before returning to orchestrate the victory.
Adam Schefter’s alarming list of injured NFL stars,  tweeted out by the  ESPN reporter on Friday morning, includes many injured on Sunday afternoons and evenings, the league’s bread-and-butter. But that, in itself, begs the question. If the league’s most marketable players are dropping so frequently on a regular schedule, should the NFL not reexamine the wisdom of short weeks? Sherman’s injury may yet be a catalyst for a move away from "Thursday Night Football."


The Cleveland Cavaliers found a good way to lose a game on Thursday night in Houston.
Hear us out. Yes, the Cavaliers dropped to 5-7 on the season as James Harden cut loose for 35 points and a triple-double, running riot against a defense that has struggled to contain far worse players than Harden this season. Eleventh in the Eastern Conference isn’t a good look for a team with championship-contending ambitions, although the season is only 12 games old and there are a clutch of middling teams sitting between the Cavaliers and the Wizards in fifth.
And there is still too much reliance on LeBron James. James was everywhere again against the Rockets, at one moment playing point guard, at another scoring from the post, rebounding, shot-blocking, on the floor fighting for loose balls… The sight of Isaiah Thomas exhorting from the sideline in civvies only seemed to reinforce the feeling that this is James’s team, for the foreseeable future. James had 33 points, four rebounds and seven assists in a monstrous 40 minutes, despite appearing to tweak an ankle early on. Right now, though, coach Tyronn Lue has to play the NBA’s best player into the ground as his team seeks to make up early ground ceded to Kyrie Irving’s Celtics, especially. That means putting up with James turning the ball over, too—he did so nine times on Thursday, which is understandable and logical when he is having to shoulder so much of the offensive burden.
For all their ongoing struggles, though, there were chinks of light in the darkness at Toyota Center. Despite Harden’s brilliance, particularly from three-point range (he faded in the fourth quarter, however), the Cavaliers pushed a Western Conference powerhouse really hard. They trailed at one stage by 18 points, and occasionally made the slick Rockets' ball-handlers appear rushed and sloppy in possession. Losing by four points to a team that may well emerge out of the West as the second seed is nothing to be ashamed of.
And then there is Jeff Green. Green, the 31-year-old former first-round pick who missed the 2011-12 season with a heart condition and has bounced around the NBA since leaving the Celtics in 2015, shone against the Rockets with 27 points, second on the team only to James. Green was excellent off the bench in Houston but he has been good all season long.  Fearthesword, the Cavaliers blog, pointed out on November 7 that Green is averaging a career-high 10.1 points per game while shooting 48.6 percent from the field. “The Cavaliers don’t move. There hasn’t been a sign that they want to move. Kevin Love, J.R. Smith, Derrick Rose, Dwyane Wade, Jae Crowder—none of them have been willing to move without the ball how Green has,” Zak Geoghegan wrote, elucidating Green’s ability to drive to the basket.
Geoghegan also makes the salient point that Green’s standout play is an issue for the Cavaliers. “I would argue that Green is as average an NBA player as they come,” he writes. Until Love, Rose, Wade and the Cavaliers’ starry supporting cast for James start backing him up consistently though, Green’s unexpected excellence may be a good problem for Lue to have.


The brain of Aaron Hernandez, a former NFL player who was convicted of murder and later hanged himself in prison, showed clear signs of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) at a stage that researchers had never seen in a person below the age of 46, according to  The Washington Post.  
As Jan Leestma, a forensic neuropathologist has time and again told  Newsweek, it’s very tricky business mapping behavior onto the physical features of the brain. Leestma, who did not evaluate Hernandez’s case, seemed struck by the fact that researchers had observed Stage 3 CTE in the brain of a man who died at 27 years old.  
“It’s certainly worrisome and impressive that you have CTE in such a young person,” Leestma told  Newsweek. “They ought to be able to somehow correlate that to number of hits and concussions and stuff like that. It probably would correlate.”

As for what that could mean behaviorally, Leestma says people with that level of CTE can become impulsive and have “rage attacks.” While Leestma himself has not seen the images of Hernandez’s brain, he speculated that the buildup of tau protein may have led to a disconnection or damage to Hernandez’s frontal lobes, which are associated with impulse control.
At the time of his death, Hernandez was serving out a life sentence for the 2013 murder of Odin Lloyd after having been  acquitted of two other murders.
As the  Post  reports, researchers at Boston University have found evidence of CTE in more than 100 people who had played for the NFL. A small number of those took their own lives. The New York Times reported that in 2011 former NFL player Dave Duerson  shot himself in the chest after texting family members requesting that his brain be studied at Boston University for signs of CTE after his death.
Hernandez’s estate, according to the  Post, filed suit against the New England Patriots in September, with the allegation that the team knew the danger Hernandez’s head injuries posed and that they did not do enough to protect him.


Paris Saint-Germain and FC Barcelona must be feeling like a defender on the other end of one of Neymar’s many step overs and flip-flaps: Utterly confused.
The Brazilian forward turned his back on Catalonia this summer, making transfer history as he completed an astonishing £199 million (about $261 million) move from the Camp Nou to the French capital—more than doubling the cost of Paul Pogba’s £90 million move to  Manchester United the summer before.
And Neymar has seemed to have settled in immediately, certainly on the pitch anyway. He has scored 12 goals in 11 games for his new club. Despite the acrimony with which he left Barcelona, Neymar has remained close with his former colleagues. He has already met up with Gerard Pique, Lionel Messi and  Luis Suarez since leaving.
In one of these meetings, according to Spanish publication  Sport, Neymar suggested to his ex-teammates that he would like to return. “Would you take me back?” is the gist of what the 25-year-old is said to have asked.

Barcelona has done pretty well without him, really. The team sits at the top of the Spanish La Liga, eight points clear of  Real Madrid, and is heading for the knockout stages of the Champions League. But the attacking trio of Neymar, Suarez and Messi—known as the Trident—was one of the most lethal and menacing line-ups in recent history.
During Neymar’s last season at the Camp Nou, they scored a combined total of 111 goals in all competitions. Only money, it seemed, could and would separate them.
But, now, Neymar has reportedly already grown tired of the lack of competition in the French Ligue 1. PSG is undefeated, top of the table and four points clear of a depleted Monaco in second. Neymar reportedly skipped the 5-0 win over Anderlecht in midweek to make sure he was fit enough to feature for Brazil through the international break. Brazil plays Japan on Friday and then travels to London to face England at Wembley Stadium on Tuesday.
The possibility of Neymar returning to Spain has been widely publicized in the past week, but with varied destinations. According to  Marca, the prospect of Neymar joining Barcelona’s biggest rival in Spain, Real Madrid, is not an “impossible dream.” Many in the Spanish capital see the Brazilian as the perfect successor to Cristiano Ronaldo when he eventually retires.


Chelsea is already preparing to make bids for Crystal Palace striker Christian Benteke and Everton’s Ross Barkley in the January transfer window, according to reports.
Antonio Conte was disappointed with the club’s business through the summer despite spending more than £150 million (about $197 million) on new players.
Alvaro Morata became  Chelsea’s record signing when he joined from Real Madrid for £70 million, and the club also picked up Tiemoue Bakayoko, Antonio Rudiger and Danny Drinkwater.
But Conte was frustrated that the club missed out on Fernando Llorente, who joined Spurs from Swansea instead, while Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain opted for Liverpool.
Barkley, the Everton midfielder, had also been a target for  Chelsea, reportedly traveling to London but changing his mind during the last transfer window. But the club is determined to secure his services in the new year, according to  The Mirror.

A hamstring injury has meant Barkley has not featured at all for Everton this season. He had frequently fallen out with former manager Ronald Koeman, and is yet to hear who his permanent successor will be. Sam Allardyce is the favorite, while David Unsworth is in interim charge.
Conte and Chelsea also want Benteke, the Palace striker, as back-up to Morata after missing out on Llorente in the summer. Conte has not shown much faith in Michy Batshuayi, the only other striker in the Italian’s squad.
Conte’s frustrations over Chelsea’s transfer activity stemmed from his belief that the club failed to replace all those who had left the previous year.
Since Conte took charge in the summer of 2016, Mikel John Obi, Branislav Ivanovic, Nemanja Matic, John Terry, Ramires, Diego Costa, Nathan Ake and Oscar have all left the club.
Despite much speculation, Chelsea is avoiding a crisis at the moment as  Sunday’s 1-0 victory over Manchester United saw the club go one point off second place in the Premier League.
Victory or a draw against Atletico Madrid next month, at Stamford Bridge, would see Chelsea qualify for the knockout stages of the Champions League.


Lonzo Ball has shown signs of the player the Los Angeles Lakers expect him to become after picking him second overall in 2017 NBA draft.
So far, in his first season in the league, the 20-year-old rookie is averaging 8.8 assists per game while helping  the Lakers defense become the fifth best in the league.
There is, however, one area in which Ball has not excelled. His shooting has been off, seeing him ranked last in the roster in shooting percentage, at 29.5 percent.
This has been a surprise for the Lakers considering his accuracy was never a problem during Ball’s time at UCLA. He shot at 55.1 percent overall during his one season there, and the reason for the drop is unclear though professional defences probably play a part in it.

But Ball did try to shed some light on the problem: It’s all in the mind, he says. After losing to the  Boston Celtics on Wednesday night, Ball addressed his form while speaking to  ESPN. “It’s in my head to be honest,” he said. “I know I can shoot the ball."
The Lakers, meanwhile, are 11th in the Western Conference, and coach Luke Walton believes he knows the difference between the Lakers and the more successful teams in the league.
“Most of those teams have been together for a while,” Walton said, as quoted by Bill Abram of the  O.C. Register, “and have gone after this and they’ve failed together. There’s nothing like failing to bring a good team together because then you realize how bad that hurts and how much more you want it.”
Walton’s team will have a chance to get back on course quickly on Thursday night as the Lakers travel to the Capital One Arena in D.C. to take on the Washington Wizards.


Mesut Ozil is finally prepared to sign a new contract at Arsenal but has one demand before putting pen to paper, according to reports.
Ozil’s contract at the Emirates Stadium expires at the end of the season, which means he is free to speak to any club he wishes in January and sign a pre-contract agreement.
But the German’s high wages have reportedly put many potential suitors off, and Ozil is happy enough to remain in north London.
He does, however, want to have a new number on the back of his jersey, the number 10, currently held by Jack Wilshere, before he signs a new deal, according to  The Sun.
Ozil has been at Arsenal since 2013 when he was signed for a then-club record transfer. He has won two FA Cups with Arsene Wenger but has been frequently criticized for failing to be the talisman the team needs.

Alexis Sanchez, meanwhile, who is also out of contract at the end of the season, still looks unlikely to sign a new deal. The Chilean forward could leave the Emirates Stadium as early as January as Arsenal looks to get some form of fee for him.
Manchester City has shown interest in him. Pep Guardiola’s team submitted a bid for Sanchez on the final day of the summer transfer window but Arsenal was too slow to find a replacement for him, so the deal collapsed.
Wenger and Arsenal have been unable to show Sanchez that the club will, once again, be a force in the Premier League after slipping to sixth in the table after 11 games and already lagging 12 points behind City.
The idea of Sanchez joining Guardiola’s squad is an ominous prospect for the rest of the league, as he would be another option in attack alongside Sergio Aguero and Gabriel Jesus, who have scored 15 goals between them.
The transfer window reopens on January 1 for a month.


Real Madrid wants to sign Juan Mata from Manchester United for free in January as the Spaniard’s contract expires at the end of the season, according to reports.
Mata is one of the many players at  Old Trafford who has just over six months to run on their contract. He is joined by Marouane Fellaini, Ander Herrera, Daley Blind and Ashley Young.
Madrid is planning on taking advantage of that situation by offering 29-year-old Mata a move to the Spanish capital at the end of the season, according to the  Daily Express.
Mata has played regularly for United this season, making 12 appearances, but has benefitted from the number of injuries the squad has suffered. Many expected him to leave Old Trafford when  Jose Mourinho was appointed manager last summer after he criticized and sold Mata while at Chelsea.
Having spent four years at Valencia, Mata does have experience of the Spanish La Liga, and he even has knowledge of the  Real Madrid system.

The Spain international began his career in the Real Madrid academy and featured 39 times for the B team before leaving for Valencia.
Meanwhile, Madrid has also shown even greater ambition in the transfer market, for a player who would certainly not be joining for free. On Tuesday, reports in Spain suggested the Real President Florentino Perez has already been in talks with Neymar’s father about a move for the Brazilian.
Neymar only completed his world-record £199 million (about $262 million) move from Barcelona to  Paris Saint-Germain a little over three months ago, but  Real is already making a move.
Neymar has shown why PSG was willing to pay such a huge sum for him this summer, having scored 11 goals in 12 appearances for the Ligue 1 giant. And it has attracted the interest of Real, which is planning for life after Cristiano  Ronaldo.
The Portuguese forward, who turns 33 in February, has had a relatively slow start to the new season by his exceptionally high standards. Ronaldo has scored just one goal in La Liga for  Real which is third in the table, eight points behind leader Barcelona.


Former major league pitcher Roy Halladay died Tuesday after his ICON A5 plane crashed in the Gulf of Mexico, 10 miles west of St. Petersburg, Florida, the Pasco County Sheriff's Office confirmed in a press conference. He was 40 years old. 
The man often called "Doc" retired in 2013 after spending 16 years in the major leagues, playing for the Toronto Blue Jays and Philadelphia Phillies. He was an eight-time All-Star and two-time Cy Young winner. He pitched one perfect game and a postseason no-hitter. At his best, there wasn't a person on the planet better at throwing a baseball 60 feet and six inches. 
But after the crash, it was clear Halladay's impact was bigger than baseball.
"Blessed to have shared the field with you as a teammate, competitor, friend and more importantly a brother," wrote former Philadelphia Phillies teammate Shane Victorino. "We lost a great ball player but an even better human being," wrote former teammate Ryan Howard. "[Roy was] one of the most respected human beings to ever play the game," said the Phillies in a statement. Many sent their thoughts to his wife Brandy and his sons, Ryan and Braden. Sheriff Chris Nocco's voice cracked delivering the news Halladay had died. "The worst case scenario happened and it breaks our hearts," he said.
In the aftermath of the tragedy and the outpouring of remembrances, it's easy to forget that Halladay's storied career wasn't inevitable. At times he was impossibly great, but he was never an overpowering or flashy presence on the mound. In 2000, he nearly flamed out of the league, posting a 10.64 earned run average through some 67 innings. But Halladay rebuilt his mechanics in the minors, and by 2003 he had won his first Cy Young award with the Blue Jays. He'd win another with the Phillies in 2010.
By the late 2000s, Halladay was widely considered one the best, if not the best, pitcher in the world. In the 2010 National League Division Series, he tossed a no-hitter against the Cincinnati Reds in his first-ever postseason appearance. It was also just the second no-hitter in MLB postseason history. Earlier in the season, he pitched a perfect game against the Florida Marlins, making him, at the time, the first player to register two no-hitters in a single season since Nolan Ryan in 1973.


When Halladay joined the Phillies in 2010, he was seen as almost mythic figure who was seeking a chance at a World Series ring. He was a competitor with unmatched intensity and a hero who was exceedingly approachable. Sure he won 21 games in a season and pitched a perfect game. But he also took the time to meet with the popular blogger Zoo With Roy at a zoo because, well, the writer made such a meeting the somewhat random goal for his website.  

As the years went on, injuries got in the way of Halladay's dominance. Shoulder problems robbed him of velocity, and he walked off the mound for good in 2013. His retirement gave me more time to purse his passion for flying, which only grew in recent years. He would often post photos of planes or cockpit selfies to social media.
At Tuesday's press conference, it was still too early for the sheriff to have an explanation for how the crash happened. But Nocco used the opportunity to speak about Halladay's accomplishments on the field and praise his positive effect on the community. 
“He was probably one of the most humble human beings you’ll ever meet,” Nocco said. “He was one in a million. It is a true loss for us.”


UPDATE: 4:19 p.m. EDT: Former MLB pitcher Roy Halladay died Tuesday in a plane crash, the Pasco County Sheriff's Office in Florida confirmed in a press conference. He was 40 years old. 
"The worst-case scenario happened, and it breaks our hearts," said Sheriff Chris Nocco.

 
Original story:
A plane owned by former Major League Baseball superstar Roy Halladay reportedly crashed in the Gulf of Mexico Tuesday. Local Tampa, Florida, news station WTSP reported that one person died in the crash. It was unclear early Tuesday afternoon if Halladay was aboard the plane. 
The Pasco County Sheriff's Office told the station that Halladay's ICON A5 plane crashed around 1 p.m. local time, about 10 miles west of St. Petersburg, Florida.
Halladay had a storied career as a pitcher with the Toronto Blue Jays and Philadelphia Phillies, appearing in eight All-Star games and winning two Cy Young Awards. He has long been known to have a passion for flying, and many of his posts to social media involved his hobby.

Former sports radio host Craig Carton is facing up to 45 years in prison on charges of wire fraud, securities fraud and conspiracy. On Tuesday, he broke his silence on the charges leveled against him in an interview with USA Today. 
The former WFAN personality co-hosted a popular New York-themed sports show with former NFL quarterback Boomer Esiason for 10 years. But Carton resigned in September after prosecutors accused him of using money from an alleged Ponzi scheme to pay off gambling debts.
Carton told USA Today that he has lost all income and his "dream job" as he awaits trial. He reportedly plans to plead not guilty in the alleged scheme in which he and others offered large numbers of tickets for face value that would then be sold later for profit.

"It is devastating," he told USA Today. "There is no other word for it. It has thrown my entire life upside down—I have to talk to my kids about things that they might not understand but that I know they are reading...adult things that no kid should ever have to read about, especially when you are talking about their father."
Carton has had some high-profile support. Friend and outgoing New Jersey governor, Chris Christie defended him in the USA Today piece. “I believe in Craig and I believe in his goodness as a person,” Christie told the paper.
Carton has largely stayed out of the media in the midst of the scandal that broke months ago. But in talking to USA Today, he couldn't help get a shot in on former Jets quarterback Geno Smith, who tweeted about the former host when the story broke. “Geno Smith? Who’s that—is he still playing football? It says a lot about Geno Smith’s career that I made him relevant again."

Robert Gottlieb, Carton's lawyer, appears to be building a case that Carton was actually a victim of the scheme, which allegedly involved more than $4 million. Gottlieb told the New York Post that a man named Joseph Meli, believed to be involved in the ticket scam, victimized Carton. 
While he prepares for his day in court, the once-outspoken Carton told the paper that he plans to make a return to his job. "I think about (being on sports radio) every minute of every day," he told USA Today. "You can bet your (butt) that I will do it again at some point."


Jose Mourinho is not a man typically known for changing his mind—stubbornness, indeed, may be one of the characteristics that helped him become the successful coach he is today.
But changing his mind is exactly what he has done over the past few months. 
Six years ago, while manager at Real Madrid, Mourinho sat in a room in Qatar with the new owners of Paris Saint-Germain and listened to their offer to become the club's new manager. A super-club would need a super-coach. But Mourinho decided not to take it.
The French Ligue 1, for Mourinho, lacked the excitement of competitions like the English Premier League, a league he was keen to return. And, of course, he did. After leaving the Santiago Bernabeu in acrimony, Mourinho won the Premier League with Chelsea and then became manager of Manchester United in the summer of 2016.

A successful first season, winning the Community Shield, League Cup and Europa League—taking United back to the Champions League—marked an upturn for both Mourinho and United. The ascent was set to continue this season, with United second in the Premier League table and heading toward the knockout stages of the Champions League. 
Related: Jose Mourinho still messages me and wanted me at Manchester United, says Alvaro Morata 
But how long Mourinho will be around at Old Trafford has grown increasingly uncertain. Speaking to French television last month, Mourinho said he was not planning on finishing his career there. "The only thing I can say is that I’m still a coach with worries, with ambitions and with the desire to do new things. And I don’t believe... no, I’m sure that I won’t end my career here," he said. 
Mourinho then went on to speak effusively about the French capital and the project at PSG. “The other day," he said, "my son who lives in London went to Paris and not to Manchester to watch the match." Asked why his son chose that option, the United manager added: “Because at the moment in Paris there is something special. Magic, quality, youth, it’s fantastic.”
Paris has reportedly been quick to act on Mourinho's words. According to the Manchester Evening News, PSG has contacted the coach's agent Jorge Mendes about Mourinho's future. 
Qatar's aim in 2011 was to dominate in French football. PSG has been champion in four of the last five seasons. And now it wants to dominate on the continent and become king of Europe. 
After Laurent Blanc, the owners turned to Spaniard Unai Emery. Emery won an unprecedented three consecutive Europa League titles with Sevilla before taking over at Parc des Princes in 2016, and saw his team eliminated by Barcelona at the last-16 stage last season. 
Mourinho, though, has the pedigree PSG wants, having won the Champions League with Porto in 2004 and with Inter Milan in 2010. And it suddenly seems to be a fit. Mourinho has changed his mind: French football is now an attractive proposition. 


As LeBron James’ frustrations in Cleveland continue to mount, on the other side of the country a plan may be starting to take shape to lure him to Los Angeles.
James has, again, starred for the Cavs this season, but this time the results have not followed. He is without  Kyrie Irving, who was traded to the Boston Celtics, while Isaiah Thomas, who came the other way, is not expected to be fit until the new year. This has affected  James and the Cavs.
The team is 13th in the Eastern Conference and is 4-6 so far this season, and the victories that have come were thanks, largely, to James’ efforts. On Friday, he scored 57 points against the Washington Wizards at Verizon Center to end a four-game losing skid that was verging on crisis.
In the west, the Lakers have not had the start they had hoped for, with a 5-5 record, which is good for 11th in the standings. But the future looks bright at Staples Center. Lonzo Ball, the rookie, is showing the signs of stardom Magic Johnson and the Lakers had hoped for, and expected.
The rumors are that they want James to opt out of his contract with the Cavs next summer and join the Lakers. And it seems they could already be making space for him.

Luol Deng has been sidelined in L.A. The decision to start rookie Kyle Kuzma over Deng last week after Larry Nance Jr. suffered a broken bone in his hand, appeared to spell the end for Deng. He was certain of it, anyway, and is now ready to leave.
"It definitely hurts," Deng told  ESPN. "But the only answer for me now is to prove myself away from L.A. I'm not asked to play, I'm not in the rotation, so I can't prove myself here.
"Most of these young guys don't understand the business of basketball, so if I come in here and I'm angry every day, I'm taking something away from them. I have to be smiling, I have to be in the best mood I can be in, because they're living their dream of being an NBA player."
He added: “You spend the whole summer like, trying to come back for the city, for the team, to prove that it was just one bad year. But the opportunity's not there. I know I make a lot of money, but for me—I came from nothing so it's always been about the love of the game.”
Deng’s departure would begin to create the LeBron-sized hole on the Lakers roster that Johnson and Luke Walton are so desperate to fill.


Brett Hundley was bad against the Detroit Lions on Monday Night Football, in the most boringly, mind-numbingly, soul-crushingly competent way possible.
Check out his numbers. There was nothing wrong, per se, with Hundley’s performance. Aaron Rodgers’s backup-turned-starter threw for 245 yards in completing 26 of 38 passes and zero interceptions. There was nothing much right with it, though, either. Spreading the ball around between 10 different receivers, including luminaries like Jordy Nelson, Randall Cobb and Davante Adams, Hundley failed to find the end zone all game. The Lions got a near-perfect game from Matthew Stafford, who completed 26 of 33 passes for 361 yards and no interceptions. If Stafford starts heating up, they can probably catch a Vikings team playing Super Bowl–caliber defense that also plans to stick with Case Keenum under center when Teddy Bridgewater returns, according to  CBS. The NFC North, not so long ago one of the strongest divisions in professional football, is now something of a mess.
“An offense that once operated with unparalleled efficiency at the hands of all-time great Aaron Rodgers is unrecognizable with Brett Hundley at the controls,” Matt Harmon wrote in a scathing takedown of Hundley’s performance on  NFL.com on Monday night. “No one makes it look easier than Rodgers. Accustomed to a quarterback who executes every facet of the position, it's painful to watch the Packers' offense manned by a player who makes every play look as laborious as possible.”
There are mitigating factors to Hundley’s futility. Since Rodgers went down with a broken collarbone against the Vikings on October 15, the Packers’ defense has been unable to make crucial stops in conceding 26 points to the New Orleans Saints and then 30 to the Lions. Rodgers could overcome those defensive weaknesses—the Packers are giving up 357.4 yards per game, eighth-worst in the NFL—a backup cannot. Hundley also isn’t being helped by a mediocre running game: The Packers are gaining 98.6 yards per game, which ranks 21st in the league. The Packers’ problems on the ground were on show on Monday night. Head coach Mike McCarthy, who calls the Packers’ offensive plays, spread the carries between five different backs, including wide receiver Cobb. Ty Montgomery ran for 33 yards on six carries, but the Packers’ second-most effective rusher was Hundley.

Once again, it feels like only Rodgers could overcome the Packers’ lack of play-action threat. Hundley, on the evidence of two full games, does not possess the skill set to overcome a laborious running game. So why, with Rodgers nowhere near a return and the offense stagnant, not rip the system up and bring in a dual-threat quarterback? Yes, Colin Kaepernick is now enmeshed in a suit alleging collusion by NFL owners in keeping him out of the league, which may finally have made him a persona never to be  grata again. But it’s uncanny how the situation Peter King outlined in  Sports Illustrated, and that we covered in the middle of October, has and hasn’t come to pass.
“My opinion: The Packers should call Colin Kaepernick on Monday morning. Not necessarily to sign him. If I were general manager Ted Thompson and coach Mike McCarthy, I’d want to meet with Kaepernick to see if he’d be willing to come in as a backup to Hundley while he took a crash course in the offense,” King wrote on October 15, opining that if Hundley struggled, the Packers would have an experienced signal-caller ready to take over for the crucial run-in to the playoffs. OK, it was almost five years ago, which may as well be a lifetime in the NFL, but McCarthy had a ringside seat for that extraordinary, spine-tingling NFC Divisional game on January 12, 2013, when Kaepernick ran for 181 yards, shredding a bemused and ultimately befuddled Packers defense.
Kaepernick is probably never going to do that again, for the Packers or any other team. But couldn’t he offer the Packers more than what Hundley is currently providing? As with the Texans and Broncos—less so the Colts—there’s a sense that certain NFL teams may be prepared to let potential Super Bowl–winning seasons slide into the ether, all for the sake of not hiring Kaepernick. McCarthy still has a chance to buck that trend. No one is holding their breath, though.


Real Madrid is working on a deal to sign Brazilian forward Neymar as Cristiano Ronaldo’s successor at the Bernabeu Stadium, according to reports in Spain.
Neymar only completed his world-record £199 million (about $262 million) move from Barcelona to  Paris Saint-Germain little over three months ago, but  Real is already making a move.
According to Spanish newspaper  Mundo Deportivo, Real Madrid president  Florentino Perez has already been in discussions with Neymar’s father, an influential figure throughout his career, regarding a move for the Brazilian.
Neymar has already shown why PSG was willing to pay such a huge sum for him this summer, having scored 11 goals in 12 appearances for the Ligue 1 giant. And it has attracted the interest of Real, which is planning for life after  Ronaldo.
The Portuguese forward, who turns 33 in February, has had a relatively slow start to the new season for his exceptionally high standards. Ronaldo has scored just one goal in La Liga for  Real which sits third in the table, eight points behind leader Barcelona.

Any deal for Neymar, the report says, is unlikely to be completed before 2021 when Ronaldo’s contract in the Spanish capital expires. But it’s not the first time Real has shown interest in the 25-year-old.
In 2013, Neymar opted to join rival club Barcelona instead of Real Madrid, where he went on to win the Champions League, two La Liga championships and three Copa del Rey titles.
Real Madrid, meanwhile, is in a period that many believe to be verging on crisis. Although only early in the season, the gap to Barcelona is large and will be impressive to recover from and win the league. In Europe, Real still looks set to advance to the knockout stages of the Champions League but Zinedine Zidane’s team was embarrassed 3-1 by Tottenham Hotspur at Wembley last week.
Former club president Ramon Calderon believes the pressure could mount quickly on the French coach. “[Perez] doesn’t like to lose,” he told  Newsweek. “I think Zidane is in trouble now, but if things are not going well in La Liga, I don’t know how he will react. At the moment, it’s too early and I don’t expect him to make a decision and sack him. I hope not.”


The Cleveland Cavaliers are struggling, and losing, and LeBron James is angry and frustrated.
That may be the simplest interpretation of James’s latest Instagram post, published in the early hours of Tuesday morning. “Mood…”, James wrote, beside a picture of the closed fist of Arthur, a cartoon aardvark. The Cavaliers lost to the Atlanta Hawks on Sunday at Quicken Loans Arena, two days after James’s 57 points had dragged them to victory over the Wizards in Washington, D.C. The Cavaliers are 13th in the Eastern Conference after ten games, above only the Chicago Bulls and the Hawks in the standings.
It’s clear that James, who has flashed M.V.P. form amid the Cavaliers’ struggles, is far from happy with what has been a sluggish start to the season at best. “At least James showed some urgency after the game [against the Hawks],  ESPN reported on Sunday. “He didn't even take the time to put on clothes after his shower, entering coach Tyronn Lue's office for a postgame meeting wearing nothing but a towel around his waist and slide sandals.”
The Cavaliers’ struggles have been starkest on the defensive side of the ball, particularly among the starters. Derrick Rose, Kyrie Irving’s replacement at point guard while Isaiah Thomas recovers from hip injuries, was a minus-27 in 20 minutes’ action against the Hawks. Jae Crowder, who arrived in Cleveland in the summer trade that sent Irving to Boston in return for Thomas, was minus-24 in 24 minutes. Dwyane Wade, James’s old buddy who scored 25 points off the bench, pointed fingers squarely at the Cavaliers’ underperforming starting lineup. "It's no secret we're starting games off awful," Wade said. “Terrible. And [Atlanta] got it going early, and the effort or the focus just wasn't there to start off, and you try to battle back, you waste a lot of energy trying to come back from 16-18 down, and it's tough nightly to do this. And we all know this. It's no secret in this locker room, but our first unit, we got to start off better."

Irving, meanwhile, has been better defensively with the Celtics than many expected and has started to produce the kind of offensive form that can help Boston cover for the season-ending injury to Gordon Hayward. Irving scored 35 points on Monday night as the Hawks pushed the Celtics hard in Atlanta, before Irving’s clutch three-pointer from the right wing gave Brad Stevens’s team a one-point lead late in the game that it would not relinquish. James’s Arthur meme was posted soon after Irving’s game finished. “The timing of LeBron's post led many fans to comment that the meme was in response to Kyrie Irving's impressive performance in the Boston Celtics' latest win,”  ESPN suggested on Tuesday morning.
To make things weirder, and funnier, Thomas and Wade both joined in the thread in the comments. “Need me to handle somebody cuz?” Thomas asked. Wade posted a series of laughter emojis.

This isn’t entirely unusual behavior for James, perhaps the NBA’s most savvy exploiter of social media. “Ladies and gentlemen: we’ve reached Inscrutable, Perhaps Deliberately Vague and Endless-Speculation-Inducing LeBron Social Media Season!”  Yahoo Sports wrote on Tuesday morning. The devil is in the ambiguity, of course. We know James is bubbling under. Only those in the Cavaliers’ locker-room will know exactly how, and why.


Jose Mourinho is in danger of losing Marouane Fellaini as the Belgian’s contract is set to expire at the end of the season, according to reports.
Fellaini has been a figure of fun for some quarters at Old Trafford, with some believing his style does not suit  Manchester United’s football.
But Mourinho is a fan of Fellaini and he frequently employs the midfielder as a tactic against certain teams. However, it seems Fellaini's future at the club is now uncertain.
According to  Turkish Football, Turkish team Besiktas is keen on signing the big midfielder and will attempt to make a pre-contract agreement in January.

Besiktas has picked off ageing talent in the European leagues in recent years. Former Real Madrid center back Pepe now plays his football there. Ricardo Quaresma, once of Chelsea, plays for Besiktas, as does Alvaro Negredo, the former Manchester City and Middlesbrough striker.
But Mourinho will not want to see Fellaini follow. He has made a point to praise the midfielder this season, singling him out on Sunday following United’s 1-0 defeat to Chelsea at Stamford Bridge.
Fellaini came on as a substitute despite still carrying an injury and having trained for only one day. Although he struggled in west London, Mourinho made a point to praise him after the game, saying he “amazing.”
“My thoughts with the substitutions was to bring [on] a third creative man," said the Portuguese coach. "And then when Chelsea started putting defensive players on like [Antonio] Rudiger and [Danny] Drinkwater and all the defensive bodies in, it was difficult to penetrate with the creativity of [Marcus] Rashford and [Anthony] Martial and the way to go would be with an amazing Marouane.
“With these different options, we created lots of chances. He has one with the chest and the volley and then the second ball Rashford shoots [just wide] with the left foot when Courtois had absolutely no chance. The players gave everything. We deserved a goal."


Wide receiver Josh Gordon was as promising a talent as any in the recent history of the NFL. But the 26-year-old's career was derailed by a long struggle with substance abuse that saw him suspended time and time again for testing positive for drugs or alcohol. He hasn't played a down since 2014, but last week Gordon was conditionally reinstated by the league.
In an interview with GQ published Monday, Gordon said he is now sober and detailed just how bad things got during his battles with addiction. He claimed that he always had something in his system during each and every NFL game he played.
"I used to make a ritual of it before every game," Gordon told GQ's Clay Skipper. "Even before I was getting tested for alcohol, prior to my DWI in 2014, I would take the biggest bong rip I could."
Sometimes, Gordon's pre-game routine meant downing shots before kickoff. "I would have these little pre-made shots," he said. "I used to love Grand Marnier. I could drink it down smooth. I could usually drink a lot of it. But if it wasn't that, it might be a whiskey or something. And I would drink probably like half a glass, or a couple shots to try and warm my system up, basically. To get the motor running. That's what I would do for games."

In the interview, Gordon described himself as a "highly functioning" alcoholic who had been on some sort of substance for every game dating back to college. But he also seemed to have truly reflected on his past struggles, saying he had finally gotten sober not for a shot at playing pro ball again or for other people but for himself.
Gordon is expected to report to the Cleveland Browns tomorrow, and could participate in team practices as soon as November 27. 
"We respect and commend Josh for taking the steps necessary to have the opportunity to return to the league," Browns executive vice president of football operations Sashi Brown said, according to the team's website. "Josh will be in our building in the coming days and we look forward to having him back and sitting with him to discuss his future on our team."

Less than a month after breaking his ankle in his first appearance for the Boston Celtics, Gordon Hayward is back on the court—though in a wheelchair. 
The 27-year-old, who signed to the Celtics in the summer, suffered a gruesome broken ankle just five minutes into the season opener against the Cleveland Cavaliers. Having signed a four-year, $128 million deal during the off-season, Hayward now looks set to miss the rest of the season.
But fans will be pleased to see Hayward back shooting hoops just 20 days after fracturing his left tibia in a collision with LeBron James.

Speaking at a press conference on Thursday last week, Hayward spoke of his relief to be back out on the court—even if it was sitting down. "Shooting out of a chair is a little bit different than shooting standing up. It's pretty short," he said, as quoted by  ESPN.
"But just to be out on the court with a basketball...that was an incredible feeling, just to start that process. Just because, for two weeks or whatever, I was in a bed with my foot up the whole time. Those hours seem like they last forever because you're just sitting there and bored and can't do much.
"I do whatever I can with the basketball. That's what I love to do. That was fun. Looking forward to any chance to do that.
"It's going to be really important for me and my mental health to stay involved and still be a part of the team as much as I can," Hayward added.


Lamar Odom reportedly collapsed in a nightclub over the weekend, sparking new concern for the former NBA star who nearly died last year amid a struggle with substance abuse. 
According to TMZ Sports, Odom was in the VIP booth of the Los Angeles nightclub Bootsy Bellows when he appeared to collapse at around 2 a.m. Sunday morning. Video posted by the celebrity news site shows Odom on the ground before a group of people lift him back up onto a couch. The former Los Angeles Laker and onetime husband of Khloe Kardashian appeared to be conscious during the incident and has reportedly recovered.
"Lamar is doing well," a representative told E! News. "He was dehydrated and had been in an intense workout earlier in the day. It was also very hot in the club."
Odom played for five teams in his 14-year NBA career. But he became a household name beyond basketball thanks to his frequent appearances on Kardashian-related TV shows. 
In 2015, Odom famously had a brush with death in a Las Vegas brothel. Police said Odom had taken cocaine and a Viagra-like supplement before losing consciousness. Doctors later determined that the drug cocktail led to an overdose. 
"I was home by myself. Bored. I wanted to get out and have a good time," Odom told Us Weekly about the brothel incident. "Looking back, I might have had a drink to get the mood started, but was I drunk or on drugs? Not at all. I remember lying in bed. Two women were in bed and then I fell asleep. That’s all. When I woke up four days later, I was trying to pull the tubes out of my mouth."
Odom told Us Weekly that he has suffered 12 strokes and two heart attacks amid a long struggle with drugs.The 38-year-old has gone to rehab and said in interviews he has embarked on a new path.
In the TMZ report, the person who filmed the incident said they saw Odom drinking before he collapsed.


On Friday night in Washington, D.C., LeBron James did what LeBron James has always done, often had to do, when his teammates were struggling. He loaded them onto his back and dragged them, kicking and screaming, to the win.
James scored 57 points against the Washington Wizards at Verizon Center to power the Cavaliers past an Eastern Conference rival and snap a four-game losing skid that was threatening to become a slide into crisis, even this early in the season. James’s monster night included 23 of 34 shootings, 11 rebounds, seven assists, three steals and two blocks. It was the second-most productive game of his NBA career, and his biggest-ever single-game points haul as a Cavalier.
There’s a paragraph from  SB Nation’s report of the game that gives a pretty accurate portrayal of how James decided to take the Wizards on by himself. “You could see this James emerge slowly over the game: He scored 24 points in the first half within the normal confines of the offense,” Tim Cato wrote. “By the start of the fourth quarter, though, the offense turned into him in a pick-and-roll with Dwyane Wade. As the quarter progressed, even that went to the wayside. It was just James, the ball, and him trying to score.” It was one man’s will against a franchise, and the man won. And it wasn’t even that surprising. James will do something similar again this season, if only because he will be forced to by the Cavaliers’ deficiencies. It’s becoming increasingly clear that if the Cavaliers are going to make a championship run this season, it’s going to be by leaning on James.

And that’s a problem. One, because every prospective suitor is going to get several good looks at just how well James still plays, even at 32. Two, because how long will James want to keep carrying a team, given his history of surrounding himself with uber-talented supporting casts? At this point—albeit it’s a terrifyingly early conclusion—there’s only one winner from the decision to send Kyrie Irving to Boston in exchange for an injured Isaiah Thomas. At least from the Cavaliers’ perspective, the Nets’ early-season hints of promise appear to have vanished, so the first-round draft pick the Cavaliers are getting come spring should be a good one.
On the night James piled up those 57 points in the nation’s capital, Paul Pierce dropped a firecracker into the free-agency speculation around The King. "If it’s not Cleveland [James’s team for 2018], it’ll be difficult to see him going out west, because the west is so tough, and the road to the finals is not easy,” Pierce said in quotes reported by  CBS. “Now, there’s one Eastern Conference team that I think he’s the best fit, and I believe it’s the Washington Wizards.
“I mean, you have a young back court still, guys where LeBron doesn’t have to carry the load every night. You have a young small forward in Otto Porter. You can play LeBron at the four.”
Let’s talk about “carrying the load.” On Sunday, the Cavaliers hosted the 8-2 Atlanta Hawks and produced their most embarrassing performance of the season so far: a 117-115 loss in which several starters struggled mightily. Derrick Rose was minus-27 in 20 minutes,  ESPN reported. Jae Crowder was minus-24 in 24 minutes.
James finished with 26 points, 13 assists and two blocks, and a comparatively excellent minus-four. Somehow the point had been made, if not by James, then by Rose and Kevin Love and Crowder and everyone on the Cavaliers playing staff who can’t seem to raise their game to help James right now (Dwyane Wade was excellent off the bench with 25 points). And the question hangs in the air above Quicken Loans Arena: How long is an MVP candidate going to put up with this?


When Thomas Wolfe’s novel  You Can’t Go Home Again was published posthumously in 1940, the message was clear.
It tells the story of George Webber, a young aspiring author, whose latest book has numerous references to his home town Libya Hill. But on his return he is met with fury and outrage, and his home is no longer familiar.
Nostalgia, Wolfe suggests, can be a dangerous thing, one that can ruin fond memories when attempting to relive them. A pursuit that is doomed to failure, which brings us to Dwyane Wade’s move to the  Cleveland Cavaliers this summer.
Whispers that Wade would sign with the Cavs increased as he continued to spend time with longtime friend  LeBron James. Although never a Cleveland player, the biggest success of the veteran’s career came when he was alongside James.
The two men teamed up at the Miami Heat from 2010 through 2014, when James returned to the Cavaliers. In that time, they won two NBA championships together.

Wade is in the autumn of his career and, as he turns 36 in January, there were suggestions he may not return to the court this summer. But the lure of playing with James once again was too much to resist. The chance to relive their success too tempting.
But it has not come to fruition so far. Not even close. After 10 games the Cavs are 4-6 and currently 12th in the Eastern Conference. They narrowly lost to the Atlanta Hawks at the Quicken Loans Arena on Sunday night, and Wade was already laying into teammates.
"I want one time for the first unit to get on the second unit because we blew a lead. I’m waiting for that day to happen,” Wade said, as quoted by  ESPN’s Dave McMenamin.
The starters, Wade suggests, are not playing well enough to give the bench crew a chance to get into the game, constantly having to fight back from a losing position.
But ESPN’s Brian Windhorst believes Cavs head coach Tyronn Lue never even intended to start Wade. “Dwyane Wade signed, and—not (because of) anything Dwyane did but—that arrival threw five or six people out of whack, including Ty Lue,” he told The Lowe Post podcast. “I’m not saying he would admit to this publicly, but he didn’t wanna start Dwyane. But he knew that he had to because it was the right thing to do for the chemistry of the team.
“He ended up starting five different lineups the first seven games. And it displaced JR Smith who pouted, and he’s playing terribly. The Derrick Rose arrival displaced a couple people—it displaced Kevin Love.”
So Wade may be in a stage of regret, in danger of ruining the memories, in a state of realization that you just can’t go home again.


Antonio Conte was probably unaware of the significance of the tie when fixture lists were released this summer. A trip up the M1 to the Hawthorns in November wouldn't have been the standout date in his calendar. In a month when Chelsea faces Manchester United and Liverpool, West Brom looked like the least of the Italian’s problems.
But given the history between the two, maybe he should be a little worried. Sure, anytime a team like  Chelsea prepares to take on a  resolute West Brom team coached by Tony Pulis, it will have to earn its victory. But Conte will have happy memories of his last visit. In May, his team secured the Premier League title on a Friday night in the Midlands. But for some of his predecessors, losses to the Baggies have proved to be the twilight of their career at  Chelsea.
In March 2012, a scrappy, late Gareth McAuley goal defeated Andre Villas-Boas’s Chelsea at the Hawthorns. Just 24 hours later, the  club’s owner, Roman Abramovich, sacked the Portuguese coach after just one win in seven games. Roberto Di Matteo stepped up, promoted from assistant coach to interim manager.
Of course, Di Matteo’s impact on the club will forever be etched into its history. His goals as a player secured two FA Cup trophies but, more importantly, his management saw the club win its first and only Champions League silverware—the trophy Abramovich truly pined for as owner.
Related:   Alvaro Morata on Texting José Mourinho and Antonio Conte Convincing Him to Choose Chelsea
Such success still bought Di Matteo little time. He took his Chelsea team to the Hawthorns on November 17, 2012, just five months after winning the European Cup, and lost 2-1 to the Baggies. It was the last Premier League game he oversaw for Chelsea, as Abramovich sacked him four days later after the team lost 3-0 to Juventus in the Champions League group stage.
José Mourinho's Chelsea was also embarrassed 3-0 at the Hawthorns in May 2015 but had already won the Premier League title. Seven months later, after a bad run following the trip to West Brom, Mourinho was out.
Will the tie prove fatal for Conte? All the noise around Stamford Bridge now is that the Italian’s future looks less than certain at Chelsea. A power play over the summer saw him fall out with key figures in the hierarchy in west London, with some  reports in Spain suggesting Abramovich was ready to wield the axe.
Conte has driven forward regardless. His players clearly still believe in him and his methods, compounded by the 1-0 win over title rival Manchester United at Stamford Bridge on Sunday. Conte outwitted his predecessor Mourinho; Chelsea would be foolish to let him go.
And, subject to an injury-free international break, Conte’s team will be approaching full fitness once again. He has Álvaro Morata back scoring goals and N’Golo Kanté back from injury and marshaling the midfield. At full strength, Chelsea looks like a force again in the Premier League.
Conte will go into the game at the Hawthorns just one point behind second-place Manchester United. Optimism has returned to west London, but he should beware the curse of the Hawthorns.


Colin Kaepernick, the National Football League’s lightning rod, continues to pursue litigation alleging collusion on the part of team owners.
On Sunday, ESPN reported that Roger Goodell will be deposed and asked to hand over all cellphone records and emails relating to Kaepernick, who began kneeling during the National Anthem in protest at perceived police brutality toward minorities in fall 2016. Among the owners deposed so far are some of the NFL’s most powerful, including the Cowboys’ Jerry Jones and the Patriots’ Robert Kraft. Jed York, the San Francisco 49ers owner, will also be deposed. Kaepernick led the 49ers to a Super Bowl appearance and an NFC Championship game in his time with the franchise before he opted out of his contract in March 2017 prior to being released. Kaepernick has not played a game in the NFL since.
In Kaepernick’s absence—not because of it directly, though as  Forbes pointed out last week, there may be a tangential connection—the NFL has struggled through the first nine weeks of the 2017 season. Aaron Rodgers, the league’s best quarterback bar maybe an ageless Tom Brady, went down for the season, in all probability, with a broken clavicle sustained against the Vikings. Andrew Luck will not see a football field for “months,” according to NFL.com, as he attempts rehab from shoulder surgery. Luck was placed on injured reserve by the Indianapolis Colts last week and won’t play an NFL game until the start of the 2018 season. The league’s best running back, Ezekiel Elliott, is at the epicenter of a convoluted legal battle over a suspended suspension for alleged domestic violence that could or could not cost him playoff appearances—no one really knows, not even the NFL. On the defensive side of the ball, we won’t see J.J. Watt until the start of the 2018 regular season, either.
Then, last week, Deshaun Watson—one of the rare bright spots for the NFL in the 2017 season—tore his ACL in practice. Watson was on pace to break all sorts of rookie records for a Texans franchise that has been screaming for a quarterback to match its dominant defense. In came Tom Savage for Watson and down went the Texans to a redundant Colts team. “What we saw with the Houston Texans on Sunday wasn't just a glimpse of life without Deshaun Watson,” Mike Freeman of  Bleacher Report wrote on Sunday. “It was a team wasting everything. Wasting its talent. Wasting its time. Wasting your time.”
"It's the most frustrating game of my career," Savage told the  Houston Chronicle. Frustrating, too, for Texans fans potentially watching another season slip away in the entirely winnable AFC South. Frustrating for Goodell, for whom a flawed product is hard to sell. Frustrating for the television networks that have to sell that product to the viewers. The rest of the week nine slate wasn’t much better. Andy Dalton just existed for the Bengals in a defeat to the Jaguars. The Chiefs’ loss to the Cowboys in Arlington was pretty fun, as was the Panthers’ narrow win over the Falcons, who look nothing like the team that blew a Super Bowl. The Rams are good and proved it again by pasting the Giants, but no one in L.A. seems to care about football and if a touchdown lands with no one there to see it, does it really count?

But it may have been the Eagles’ blowout of the Broncos that encapsulated the NFL’s problem in 2017. “In a year without an overwhelming favorite, the Eagles are as close to dominance as the NFL has right now,” Judy Battista wrote for  NFL.com on Sunday. After Watson went down, Carson Wentz may be the NFL’s most exciting young quarterback, especially when compared with his counterpart under center on Sunday, Brock Osweiler. Handed another chance to be the Broncos’ starter, Osweiler threw for two interceptions and 208 yards. If anything—and almost unbelievably—the Broncos’ offense seems to be getting worse as the season goes on.
“This [Houston] is a team that has a legitimate chance to make the Super Bowl, and it could still make it with Kaepernick,” Freeman writes. Ditto, surely, for the Broncos had they pulled the plug on Trevor Siemian/Osweiler a few weeks ago. Both teams could ride all-worldly defenses and competent quarterback play through the playoffs. But for whatever reason, they continue to ignore Kaepernick. And the NFL’s product continues to suffer.


Radio phone-ins were surely made for fanatical football fans spitting hyperbole. And on Sunday, José Mourinho’s drab record against rival teams saw one supporter label his Manchester United team a “rich West Brom.”
Dialing in to BBC Radio Five Live, presented by Kelly Cates and joined by former Arsenal and England striker Ian Wright, the United fan was clearly irritated after seeing his team  fall to a 1-0 defeat at Stamford Bridge on Sunday.
Álvaro Morata’s headed goal saw United lose to  Antonio Conte’s Chelsea and slip 8 points behind  Premier League leader Manchester City, which beat Arsenal 3-1 earlier in the day.
After the game,  Mourinho’s record away to top six rivals was highlighted. Since January 2015, while still at Chelsea, the Portuguese coach had overseen six defeats and five draws in the big games on the road.

“Mourinho has played 10 times against the top six: Five 0-0 draws, six defeats, and you know what we are at the end of the day, Kelly and Ian? We’re just a rich West Brom. That’s all we are. We’re playing boring, horrific football,” the caller said.
“We are a rich West Brom. When we are struggling, we bring on a tree in [Marouane] Fellaini and lump it forwards and hope for the best. We're not going anywhere.”

The comparison to West Brom taps into the widely held belief that Tony Pulis, the club’s manager, plays a negative style of football that is far from pleasing to the eye. He is viewed as a safe pair of hands, but don’t expect to be thrilled.
Unlike Pulis and West Brom, however, Mourinho was able to spend around £150 million (about $197 million) to strengthen his United squad this summer.
The caller added: “Where are we going with this team? We’re paying thousands of pounds to watch our team and we’re passing it backwards. We know what’s going to happen, it’s going to be 0-0 after 20 minutes.”
Take a look here:

The statistics get even worse for Mourinho as at both Chelsea and Manchester United his teams have scored just once in the last nine of those games; Wayne Rooney scored a 71st-minute goal at White Hart Lane in May when Tottenham was already 2-0 ahead.
But the coach insisted he had little concern. “I don’t know the number, I don’t know the quality. I was on the bench following the game and not counting. I think we had chances,” Mourinho said.
“If I remember, [Nemanja] Matić's header in the face of [Chelsea goalkeeper Thibaut] Courtois. If I remember, [Romelu] Lukaku's shot in the first half, and if I remember in the last part of the game, [Marcus] Rashford's shot and Courtois without any chance. The cross to the far post to Fellaini with the chest and the volley, and the consequence of that. We had lots of chances to score a goal.”
Just a rich West Brom? Mourinho would disagree.

David Luiz’s future at Chelsea looks increasingly uncertain after Antonio Conte dropped the Brazilian center back from the entire squad for Sunday’s victory against Manchester United.
Luiz sat in the stands behind the home dugout while  Danish defender Andreas Christensen was promoted to the  Chelsea back line against Jose Mourinho’s team.
Christensen provided a performance that justified Conte’s decision, with  Alvaro Morata’s goal the only goal of the game. Speaking after the match, the Italian coach suggested Luiz will remain on the sidelines.

Here’s everything Conte had to say on the matter:
“Christensen is 22 years old, he showed great personality, for sure he is the present and the future for Chelsea, the same for [17-year-old Ethan] Ampadu,” Conte told Sky Sports.
“David Luiz has to work with the others if he deserves to play, otherwise he will stay on the bench or in the stands.”

&quot;Christensen is the present &amp; future for Chelsea&quot;After Antonio Conte&#39;s comments, is time up for David Luiz (again)?https://t.co/lUW7GJbb3M pic.twitter.com/vzMfjMmtl3
In his post-match press conference, Conte was again asked about Luiz and to expand on his comments to the television cameras:
“I don’t know. He has to work really hard, otherwise they are on the bench or in the stand.” The Italian was subsequently asked to clarify those comments, and added: “It’s very simple, no? Very simple. The coach has to make the best decision for the team and tonight the best decision for the team was to play with Christensen and to have, on the bench, [Ethan] Ampadu. Another young player. A really good player for the present and the future.
“Maybe in the future I can decide a different way or continue in this way. That’s normal. I must take the best decision for the club, not for a single player. It’s only a tactical decision. It’s normal. This can happen to every one of my players, if I see they are not in good form. It’s normal. I repeat: I have to put my face to every situation and then sometimes to make important decisions. Today I did this and I think Christensen played a massive game. I was very happy for this.”
Victory saw Conte’s team go one point behind second-place Manchester United, but it also created an eight-point gap at the top of the Premier League table. Manchester City’s win against Arsenal earlier in the day means Pep Guardiola’s team has a hefty lead heading into the international break.


At full-time, José Mourinho stood at the top of the tunnel at Stamford Bridge, lingering, just as he had done two hours earlier. But the expression on his face was entirely different: swagger had been displaced by trauma. 
It may have been down to the realisation that Pep Guardiola and Manchester City now have an eight-point lead at the top of the Premier League. Or, possibly, how short his team had fallen in west London against a Chelsea team supposedly on the verge of crisis. But, just maybe, it was watching Antonio Conte, his new nemesis in England, striding straight onto the turf at full-time, ignoring the usual post-match pleasantries between managers. 
Conte’s players deserved his full praise. He hugged the impressive, immovable Andreas Christensen, promoted to the defense ahead of David Luiz, who was dropped from the squad entirely. He pulled N’Golo Kante into an embrace, clearly relieved at how the industrious midfielder had returned a balance to his team. And he thrust his arms around Álvaro Morata, the man who has helped paper over the cracks at Chelsea this season, and who provided the moment of class here to win this tie. 
When Morata made the £60 million move from Real Madrid to Chelsea in the summer, it was Cesar Azpilicueta who helped him settle in. He welcomed him to the Spanish contingency at the club’s Cobham training ground. He helped him find a temporary home in London. The two men have a clear bond, one that proved to be the difference just ten minutes into the second half.

Driving in-field, Azpilicueta delivered a whipped cross into the United area that found Morata, alone and unmarked. The striker rose high, arched his neck, and sent the ball back toward the far post, looping into the net. David de Gea in the United goal could only stand and watch. It was a sumptuous header, the type of skill that impressed Mourinho so much he gave Morata his debut at Real Madrid in 2010, and has seen the two men keep in touch ever since. Morata shouldn’t expect his next text from Mourinho too soon now, though.

This match ended up being the tight and tense clash that the Premier League was made famous for when Mourinho first arrived in English football. Fears that it would be the type of drab non-contest that he has been accused of creating lately, tactically nullifying games against title rivals, were unfounded. Within the first 10 minutes, both teams could and should have scored. 
Chelsea actually did in the sixth minute, but the goal was disallowed—a decision that appeared slightly unfair. Marcos Alonso’s cross was turned past De Gea by Phil Jones, but referee Anthony Taylor adjudged Morata to have fouled the England center-back. Two minutes later at the other end, Marcus Rashford found himself unmarked at the far post but headed over Thibaut Courtois’ crossbar. He should be studying footage of Morata this week, who has scored five of his eight goals for Chelsea via his head. 
Prior to kick-off though, the headline news had been Conte’s decision to drop Luiz, but also the return of Kante, who had been out injured since the start of October. Kante’s involvement returned a balance to Conte’s team. His industry and artistry provides a significant difference to Chelsea, giving Cesc Fabregas license to roam and freeing Tiemoue Bakayoko of the defensive responsibilities—which was clear in the first half. 
Fabregas was dictator in the middle of the field. He picked out Davide Zappacosta on the right wing who sent a cross that squirmed and skid through a crowd of players, falling to Bakayoko. He took his shot first time and sliced it wide. Minutes later, he picked up the ball again in United’s half but his shot, once again, failed to test De Gea. Chelsea was taking control of the game, dominating in possession. 
United’s best chance of the half came through Romelu Lukaku in the 16th minute. A cross ball was chested down by the Belgian striker, who shifted the ball to his right but his fierce drive was saved by the outstretched Courtois. Lukaku failed to impose himself on the game and the criticism begins to rise again on whether he can perform in the big games, having drawn a blank against Liverpool, Tottenham and now Chelsea. 
Conte’s team continued to create chances. Morata shot straight at De Gea after the half-hour mark and Christensen headed over from a Fabregas corner just before half-time. Conte simmered on the sideline but began to boil as his team spurned each opportunity. 
So when the goal came 10 minutes into the second half, the Italian threw his fists to the sky with relief. He punched the air at Morata’s eighth goal of the season. It was money well spent. 
"Antonio, Antonio," reverberated around Stamford Bridge. Mourinho reacted quickly. Within five minutes, he had Anthony Martial and Marouane Fellaini warmed up and ready to come on. The big Belgian’s impact was almost immediate when he knocked down to Rashford, but the 20-year-old’s shot was deflected to safety. Conte introduced Antonio Rudiger and removed Zappacosta which eased the impact of Fellaini. 
Fellaini’s lack of fitness was clear to see. He was caught in possession by Fabragas and Morata failed to convert the opportunity. Just 10 minutes later, it was Bakayoko who nicked the ball from Fellaini but shot wide. Mourinho and United were let off. 
The story could have been very different for Fellaini. But for the fingertips of Courtois, he would have been the hero, allowing Mourinho to take a point back to the north west of England. With only a minute to go, Fellaini sent a cross toward the bottom corner of the Chelsea goal but his countryman tipped away to safety. 
Mourinho's last switch saw Jesse Lingard introduced for Ashley Young but Conte responded by bringing on Danny Drinkwater for Fabregas, who receieved a standing ovation. United pushed in the final minutes but Chelsea held firm. It wasn't meant to be. 
Conte purred with excitement and Mourinho trudged back down the Stamford Bridge tunnel. This used to feel like home to him. 


Alvaro Morata scored a superb header to see Jose Mourinho lose a third consecutive game at Stamford Bridge and fall eight points behind Premier League leader Manchester City. 
The Spanish striker met a Cesar Azpilicueta cross in the 55th minute with a powerful header that looped over David de Gea and won the game for Chelsea with his eighth goal of the season.
City's 3-1 win over Arsenal earlier in the day meant United had to win in west London, but many now see the title race as practically over.

Antonio Conte's team is within a point of Manchester United in the table now, in fourth. Here are five things Newsweek learned from the game:
It could have been any of Conte’s back line. So far this season the Chelsea defense has been a shadow of last season, with the trusty Cesar Azpilicueta showing signs of uncertainty and Gary Cahill prone to mistakes, but it was David Luiz who was cut. Not just from the team but the squad. A sign of how frustrated Conte has been this season with how his resolute defense of six months ago looks to be strangers. So in came the Dane Andreas Christensen, and fully justified it was. Composed and trustworthy, the 21-year-old kept the back line in order with Cahill to his left and Azpilicueta to his right. He could have even helped Chelsea at the other end when he headed over from a corner just before halftime. It will have made worrying viewing for Luiz, though. 
The memories of Chelsea fans will, Mourinho says, eventually fade. Before his second return to Stamford Bridge since becoming Manchester United manager, Mourinho insisted his time in west London will soon be forgotten and the significance of his return will wane. "In a couple of years it will be even more natural and in four or five years probably no one will remember that I was Chelsea manager and it becomes absolutely normal,” he said. But until then, he will make sure he’s remembered. Mourinho appeared from the tunnel at Stamford Bridge well before kick-off on Sunday, standing at the entrance. He greeted each and every Chelsea player as they arrived, and waited for Antonio Conte to shake hands, his dominance asserted.

In an interview with Newsweek this week, Álvaro Morata revealed that he could have been playing at Old Trafford this season and that he has remained in touch with Jose Mourinho, his former coach, via text message. “It’s good and I appreciate these things because he was my first coach,” Morata said, “but now he’s—not my enemy—my rival.” And so it proved to be, his bond with Mourinho insignificant when Cesar Azpilicueta delivered a whipped cross in the 55th minute. The friendship didn’t matter when Morata met the ball and sent it looping over a helpless David de Gea and into the net. 
Moments after Chelsea took the lead, Mourinho was ready to react Marouane Fellaini and Anthony Martial was prepared and sent on to Phil Jones and Henrikh Mkhitaryan, the intention clear. Immediately, United began to send the ball up toward the fluffy frame of Fellaini. Marcus Rashford almost benefitted when the towering Belgian knocked the ball down to him, only to see his shot deflected away. Fellaini’s cameo was short and rather painful. Although not fully fit, the Belgian was booked for catching Morata with an elbow and almost allowed Chelsea to double the lead when Bakayoko nicked the ball from him but sent his effort wide. The story could have been entirely different, though, as Thibaut Courtois saved low from a Fellaini shot with just a minute remaining. 
The headline news for Antonio Conte ahead of kick-off was the return of N’Golo Kante to his starting line-up. Kante has watched from the sidelines for almost a month as Chelsea verged on implosion; the defeat to Crystal Place, fortunate victory over Watford and embarrassment in Rome. And his importance to this team was clear on Sunday. Not only his industrious nature in midfield that saw United overwhelmed and outnumbered, but his link to attack. He is both the pen and eraser. Romelu Lukaku was given the job to reduce his impact, Mourinho imploring the Belgian striker to drop in onto Kante when Chelsea had possession. 


Adebayo Akinfenwa has become a cult icon in the footballing world, with a big personality and even bigger biceps.
He rose to fame in youth culture after his rating as the strongest player on FIFA, the vastly popular football simulation video game, and procured the name ‘The Beast’ due to his size and power. His time playing for Wimbledon AFC grabbed the nation’s attention with an FA Cup-run reaching the third round in 2015 and then a promotion winning penalty in 2016.
So he is no stranger to the spotlight, despite playing in lower leagues for most of his career. Which is why he gives the strong sense he really enjoys the publicity surrounding his autobiography, The Beast: My Story, published this week.
“It’s just become life, I prefer to be busy than not busy,” the Wycombe Wanderers striker told Newsweek.
“Putting my life on a piece of paper, it’s mad for people to want to read it.”
As a life-long Liverpool supporter, Akinfenwa was delighted that Liverpool legend Steven Gerrard contributed to the book.
“For one of England’s best ever players to write a foreword for my book, I would hope that that would inspire people to say you know what the sky is not the limit and anything can happen. For me, it’s humbling in that sense.”

The striker has joked about his frustration with FIFA after he scored 18 goals last season and yet his stats on the videogame had not improved this year.
“That’s what’s driving me you know! The aim out here is to try and beat 18!”
On the videogame he revealed he always plays with whatever team he is currently playing for in real life, so that he can play as himself.
“I shout at myself all the time! I put myself on corners and free kicks just to see how it feels to take dead balls because I’m never good enough to take them in real life!”
When asked who his dream strike partner would be, Akinfenwa unsurprisingly named Lionel Messi, the five-time Ballon D’Or winner and arguably the best player in the world. In terms of who he thinks would suit his style of play, Leicester City striker Jamie Vardy was his choice though.
“If I were to say someone who would complement me, it would have to be someone really quick because he’d have to do my running for me! I do think me and Vardy would work well together, just because his whole game is about running in behind and it works well when you’ve got someone who is – well I won’t say I’m slow but let’s just say I’m less fast – and someone who is faster!”
The Wycombe wonder clearly knows his strengths and weaknesses. Now 35, Akinfenwa has had a long career in football, an aspect he is grateful for.
“Sometimes you’re not blessed with the materialistic stuff but you’re blessed with a work ethic,” he said, attributing his determination to his upbringing.
The striker was born and raised in Islington, London, and grew up in a council estate. He says football is all he knew from the age of five, when he would play every day until his feet hurt. His work ethic and discipline was instilled in him from a young age by his parents.  
“I think you’re a product of your environment so I will be teaching my kids the same that you can strive to achieve whatever you need to achieve but it doesn’t come easy, you have to put in the work.”
Akinfenwa has been putting in the work for almost 18 years now and is conscious of people categorising him as ‘past it’.
“I’m feeling good and I’m still scoring goals so it’s a mind-set for me – don’t allow anyone to put you in boxes and keep defying limitations,” he says.
“I’m no spring chicken but as long as I feel good mentally and physically I’ll keep playing as long as possible.”
Mentality is one of his main focuses in life and he has now put plans in motion for a footballing academy and a mentoring scheme to help young people across London deal with the trials and tribulations of trying to make it in the game, open to “any and everybody who wants to play football.”
Set to start in summer 2018, Akinfenwa said psychological mentoring will play a crucial role in what he teaches the youngsters.
“I feel that the mind is as important as ability in the body,” he says.
“People concentrate on ‘oh you can’t do that’, or ‘you’re a bit too big for that’ or whatever, rather than just concentrating on what you’re good at.
“It’s about being comfortable with the skin you’re in, being comfortable within your own mind.”
His philosophical attitude may stem from his long stint in the game, playing for 13 clubs to date including teams in England, Wales, and Lithuania. As a footballer in the autumn of his career he feels he can now give something back to the sport.
“I do think there is a responsibility for myself as being a senior professional footballer to be able to pass on my experiences to the younger generation.
“As a leader, as a way to try and channel and get the best out of people, I think I’m pretty good at that.”
However, Akinfenwa is also known for not taking life too seriously and advocating the lighter side of sport.
“For the last four years I’ve really tried to embrace the enjoyment of football, I know sooner or later I’m going to hang up my boots.
“As long as I’m enjoying it I’ll keep putting my body through it.”
Another sport he feels he would enjoy is American football and supports Miami Dolphins.
“I’m a real fan, the last couple of years I’ve been learning and I’ve been watching and the atmosphere is insane. I’ve played in a play-off final, I’ve watched the FA Cup final and then I watched just a normal NFL game and you would think it was a final because the atmosphere was so electrifying.
“I think I would have held my own in the NFL… but I like being the biggest on the pitch so I’ll stick to football!”
Akinfenwa certainly is the biggest on any pitch he walks on, but his character off the pitch is just as giant, moulded by the experiences of many years in the footballing trade and a career including lows as well as highs.
Adebayo Akinfenwa's book, The Beast: My Story, details his life and is available from booksellers across the U.K. and online. 


Álvaro Morata sits at a table in a large conference room just behind the Shed End at Stamford Bridge, a pensive look on his face. He is weighing up the differences between two of the most influential managers of his short career: José Mourinho, the man who gave him his first chance at Real Madrid in 2010, and Antonio Conte, who signed him for Juventus in 2014 and then made him the most expensive player in Chelsea’s history this summer.
A wry smile. “Antonio has the long hair, blue eyes!” he says, before bursting into laughter. “No, they’re two kinds of coaches; they’re different. Both are winners but different in character. It’s wonderful playing with Mourinho and winning with Mourinho [but] now it’s time to try to win with Antonio. It’s a wonderful opportunity.”
And it is an opportunity that, so far, he has thrived upon. Despite his hefty £60 million cost to  Chelsea, charged with replacing  Diego Costa as the main striker at Stamford Bridge, Morata has excelled under the pressure. While  Chelsea may, at times, miss the domineering style of Costa, Morata has added a touch of class to Conte’s attack, developing a natural partnership with Eden Hazard.
The Spaniard, a double Champions League winner who only turned 25 last week, scored seven times in his first eight appearances in  Conte’s team—the last coming in September at the Wanda Metropolitano when Chelsea pulled off an impressive victory against Atletico Madrid in the Champions League. But a lot has changed since then. A hamstring injury saw  Morata limp out of the 1-0 defeat to Manchester City in September and watch the shock 2-1 loss to Crystal Palace from the sidelines.

Despite winning the Premier League title just six months ago, Conte’s future at Chelsea is suddenly in doubt, especially after his team was humbled by a 3-0 defeat to Roma in the Champions League on Tuesday. But Morata’s soft voice reflects his message: He is calm and thoughtful, ignoring the hyperbole outside the club. “Unfortunately,” he says, “football is like this: When we take the three points at Atletico we are one of the best teams in Europe, and this week we lose against a very good team and they think the world ends.”
Chelsea will still likely advance to the knockout stages of the competition as it is four points ahead of third-place Atletico in Group C, but that hasn’t stopped the storm cloud forming above Stamford Bridge. This is not the first time Morata has experienced a tough night on the European stage, though. He recalls an October evening in Athens in 2014 when he and Juventus looked to be heading out of the competition after two defeats from the first three games of the group stage. “I remember when I was at Juventus we lost against Olympiakos and we were in a worse position than we are after this loss against Roma. That year, we arrived in the final [but lost to Barcelona]. It doesn’t matter. The most important thing is to be in the next round.”
Morata and Chelsea must quickly switch their attention back to the Premier League, for on Sunday a familiar face will step out of the tunnel at Stamford Bridge and into the away dugout. Mourinho’s Manchester United travel to west London with 10 wins in the last 12 games, and Morata could well have found himself in the away dressing room this weekend.
“I had the chance to go to Manchester United and other teams in the Premier League,” he says. “The important thing is I’m part of Chelsea and I’m very happy with this and now it’s time to fight for the blue shirt. I want to play well and win with this shirt.”

While Morata recognizes the need for victory this weekend, he remains close to his former coach. Mourinho is known to stay in touch with players even after they part ways; he called Costa this summer during his exile at Chelsea; he texted Romelu Lukaku when he signed for Everton. Is that the case with Morata as well? “Yeah,” he says. “Not only this summer. I have a good relationship with Jose. He was my first coach in professional football and he gave me the chance to be a professional. He made me the first contact. Sometimes we send messages but not speaking about football, asking if everything’s OK and some jokes.
“It’s good and I appreciate these things because he was my first coach, but now he’s—not my enemy—my rival. We need to win.” The worry for Mourinho, however, is how much Morata will be keen to impress him on Sunday.

The Banana Boat Photo has become NBA canon, part of the lexicon of the league and something immediately recognizable to people who pay attention to (and crack jokes about) hoops.
For the remaining few who are uninitiated, the picture shows actress Gabrielle Union and NBA superstars Dwyane Wade (Union's husband), Chris Paul and LeBron James all sitting in an inflatable banana boat, ready to be tugged along the water. The group was on vacation together in the summer of 2015 and decided to take an excursion off their yacht. The photo became an instant internet sensation because it showed these untouchable stars—all of which are massively wealthy and talented as well as effortlessly cool—looking, well, kind of dorky. 
The photo, which was snapped surreptitiously by a photographer, still comes up in interviews with those involved, including Union in the most recent episode of First We Feast's Hot Ones, which features stars being interviewed as they eat chicken wings laced with increasingly spicy sauces. (Newsweek recently published a story on Complex Networks, which owns First We Feast, that you can read here.)

"Whose idea was it? Who put the credit card down? Was it as much fun as it looked?" asked host Sean Evans.
Union can certainly spin a tale. Much of her answer dripping with sarcasm, she explained how she'd actually planned the activity and that the photographer missed the best part: the group of NBA superstars and the leading actress tumbling into the water. Here's what she told Evans:
“I will take credit for the banana boat fiasco or glory, depending on how you look at it. The first year that we started going on the couple trip, LeBron and Savannah [James], they chose the boat, they chose the location, and that boat had all kinds of bells and whistles. There was, like, a three-story slide into the ocean, they had jet skis and then they had other inflatable toys that could be pulled because this smaller boat called the tender. So I saw that banana boat and I wanted to ride it… I was like, ‘Who’s coming with me?’ And none of the girls wanted to go. So I had to try to convince Bron and D and CP to get on the banana boat. It took some convincing. Though we had not been photographed, everyone was convinced we were being surveilled. And I was like, ‘No, not everyone cares about us guys. No one is gonna see us. And if anyone is coming down the slide or dancing or whatever, we’re safe. Get over yourselves.’ So we mount the banana boat, I am in front, then my spouse, then I think it’s CP [and LeBron]. Then what they did not capture was actually the best part. Once we had all mounted the banana, that boat took off and no one was really prepared. We were there for the initial jolt, and then [the driver] hung a hard left and we flew off and landed, side-face first, like [claps loudly]. All of us were like, ‘Fuck, fuck, fuck,’ like that’s all you heard in the water. It hurt, it was painful, but magically, [photographers] only got us astride.”
Of course, despite Union's assertions, the picture got out, and the NBA stars ribbed her about it. NBA fans made their jokes, and many still refer to that group of superstars as the "banana boat crew." 
James and Wade, who were once teammates in Miami, joined forces again this season on the Cleveland Cavaliers. The full interview with Union goes into their friendship, Union's impressive career in Hollywood and her own high school career on the basketball court. You can watch it embedded below.



The college basketball season begins Friday, November 10, amid fallout from an ongoing FBI investigation into alleged bribery among coaching staffs at several of the nation’s top schools.
But the hype, expectations and excitement—all the stuff those schools would probably be really happy to focus on—is already with us, courtesy of the preseason rankings.
How do the nation’s best basketball analysts see Duke’s chances of fulfilling the lofty achievements expected of it? Will the recruiting scandal affect highly-rated Arizona? Read below to find out.
The Associated Press
AP has Duke ranked first in the country, followed by Michigan State, Arizona and Kansas. The Wildcats round out the top five.  NCAA.com has a word of warning, though: While it’s hard to argue against Duke’s No. 1 ranking, Duke was ranked first going into the 2016-17 season, too, and lost in the second round to South Carolina. The Gamecocks, who lost in the Final Four to Gonzaga on April 1, are unranked. In a national media poll published Wednesday, Duke, which will start the season with the top-ranked recruit in the nation, Marvin Bagley III, received 33 of 65 first-place votes, according to  ESPN. North Carolina, the defending national champion, will begin the season ranked ninth.
ESPN
John Gasaway’s exhaustive and labyrinthine effort makes the AP Top 25 look like a comic strip next to  War and Peace. In a piece for ESPN Insider published Friday, and via some methodology you can read about  here, Gasaway comes out with Arizona, followed by Wichita State, followed by Duke. Michigan State and Villanova round out his top five. Gasaway’s 351st-and-last ranked team in the nation? Mississippi Valley State Delta Devils. This is some piece of work.
Sports Illustrated
SI has also produced an impeccably comprehensive list of all 351 teams in college ball this season. Claiming its rankings have been “more accurate than similar 1–351 rankings produced by ESPN, CBS Sports and noted analyst Ken Pomeroy for three consecutive years,” and using a combination of “college and AAU statistics, recruiting rankings and coaching data,” SI places Arizona first in the country, followed by Michigan State, Duke and Wichita State. SI’s reasoning for Duke only being third-ranked? “Even if Bagley is as gifted as scouting reports imply, this is still a young team, and SI’s model isn’t looking past head coach Mike Krzyzewski’s less-than-stellar track record coaching defense in recent seasons,” the publication opines.
Ken Pomeroy
The noted basketball analyst lists his ranking for 2017-18 on his website  here. As usual, Pomeroy has crunched a volume of data that would make mere mortals feel a little queasy. At the end of it all, he lists Villanova as his top team in the nation. Arizona is third, Duke a relatively lowly sixth. Gonzaga, fresh off a loss in the national championship game, is down in 20th.


Top of the Eastern Conference and on a six-game winning streak, life has been pretty good for Kyrie Irving since he traded Cleveland for Boston.
After three years in  LeBron James’ shadow, Irving was part of the summer’s most sensational trade, joining the Celtics from the Cavaliers with  Isaiah Thomas going the other way.
But the 25-year-old point guard has clearly shown flashes of resentment toward his former team. He was fined $25,000 last month for lashing out at a  fan who taunted him about James, and snapped at reporters when asked whether he had  spoken to James about leaving the Cavs.
And, now, it seems he has subtly criticized Tyronn Lue, his former coach in Cleveland, by describing Brad Stevens of the Celtics as the kind of coach he had been “unbelievably craving.”
“Brad fits perfectly in terms of that because he has an intellectual mind and is an intellectual human being,” Irving told Geno Auriemma on the  Holding Court podcast. “It was something I was unbelievably craving in terms of what I wanted for my career.”

Stevens is widely regarded as one of the brightest young coaches in the league since he took over the Celtics in 2013, a sentiment shared by Gregg Popovich, who knows a thing or two about great coaching.
“He’s going to be a great one before it’s all over with, and he’s already a hell of a coach,” the San Antonio Spurs coach said.
The Cavs, meanwhile, have struggled without Irving, and with Thomas likely to be sidelined with injury until the new year. The team is 13th in the Eastern Conference and currently on a four-game losing streak.
The latest defeat came against the Indiana Pacers on Wednesday, ending 124-107 at the Quicken Loans Arena. “It’s a new month,” James said, as quoted by  ESPN. “We have an opportunity to be very good and then you see some of the lulls that we have and it's just very difficult on our team right now.
"We're just trying to figure it out on the fly. So, our team is kind of depleted as well, both on and off the floor."


Coaching at an elite level, we are regularly assured, is an awful lot about making the tough and unfriendly decisions about individuals in order to improve the prospects of the collective.
Like benching Lonzo Ball, for instance?
On Thursday night at Moda Center in Portland, the Lakers lost for the fifth time this season, on a three-pointer by Damian Lillard as time expired. Lillard, a two-time All Star, finished with 32 points, six rebounds and five assists—the kind of numbers you expect regularly from an elite point guard eight games into his sixth NBA season.
And Ball? Ball, in his eighth game of a rookie season that has soared, occasionally, and explored the hinterland of rough promise, sometimes, was held to zero points.
Nul points, as they tell the United Kingdom at the Eurovision Song Contest, or the Brexit negotiations, as that discordant musical show has come to be known. Ball attempted two shots, according to  ESPN, missed both of them, and ended the game with four assists, three rebounds, two blocks and a steal. That the Lakers pushed the Trail Blazers into the final second of the game was mostly down to Ball’s supporting cast. Brook Lopez led the Lakers in scoring with 27 points. Brandon Ingram and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope chipped in with 14 each, Jordan Clarkson too. Since he broke out with 29 points against the Phoenix Suns on October 21, Ball’s points per game have read eight, six, five, nine, 13, and nada. In the Lakers’ past two games, and past two losses, against the Pistons and Trail Blazers, Ball has played 28 minutes in each and attempted four three-pointers in total, hitting one.
"I thought he was a little too passive tonight," Luke Walton, the Lakers head coach, said after the defeat as reported by  ESPN. "I think that'll continue to be [an area to work on]. The hardest thing for young players is the consistency when you just play so many games. He's so unselfish. We want him to be more aggressive with attacking the defenses. I feel like tonight was one of those nights where he was more passive with it than looking to really attack them."
Points totals can fail to tell the whole story, especially with a facilitator like the Lakers’ rookie. Ball was a plus-10 in his 28 minutes of action on Thursday night—even when he is struggling to be noticed offensively, there is evidence to suggest he is improving the players around him. There were moments against the Trail Blazers—as there have been throughout the season—when Ball flashed the kind of promise that Walton and the Lakers hope will become consistent excellence. You can watch one slick feed to Lopez in the video below.
 
&quot;A great feed by Lonzo Ball&quot; #LakeShow(_: TNT) pic.twitter.com/Tf11RKer2K
 

The Lakers have stressed regularly that this season is about Ball, and the Lakers, showing off enough rough promise to convince interested parties—impending free agents among them—that the franchise is on track to contend again. The hype around Ball, though, means stat lines like Thursday night’s are going to be noticed and blown up in widescreen and feed the ravenous desire to polarize Ball’s abilities and achievements. Maybe it’s time for Walton to take Ball out from under the NBA’s sunlamp. Then again, maybe that would just increase the feeding frenzy.


Antonio Conte is set to become the ninth manager sacked during the Roman Abramovich era at Chelsea, despite winning the Premier League title six months ago, according to reports.
Conte led  Chelsea to a surprise championship in his first season in English football after suffering a poor start, but rumors of rifts and poor results have followed this season.
The Italian was reportedly unhappy with the transfer business the club completed over the summer, missing out on Fernando Llorente and Antonio Candreva.
And now, it seems, Abramovich has once again seen enough. According to Spanish newspaper  Marca, the ruthless Russian has already decided that he is ready to sack Conte and is not even on speaking terms with him.
But his second season at the club has been far from a disaster.  Chelsea is fourth in the Premier League, nine points short of Pep Guardiola’s rampant Manchester City, but looks set for the knockout stage of the Champions League.

Chelsea beat Atletico Madrid at the Wanda Metropolitano last month but a disastrous 3-0 defeat away to Roma on Tuesday sent dark clouds over Stamford Bridge.
Conte’s opportunity to lift them comes on Sunday, ironically against  Manchester United and  Jose Mourinho, the last man Abramovich sacked as Chelsea manager—for the second time—in December 2015.
Mourinho, like Conte, had won the Premier League the previous year but player unrest and an alarming slide down the table saw Abramovich act early and bring in Guus Hiddink as interim manager.
Abramovich has a track-record in English football for being relentless with managers. His ultimate aim, winning the Champions League, was achieved in May 2012 by Roberto di Matteo. Six months later, he was sacked and replaced by Rafael Benitez.
Before them, Carlo Ancelotti won the double with Chelsea in 2010, his first season at the club, but was sacked the following season after finishing second in the table. 


The end doesn’t come suddenly. That would be too easy, too clean and too painless. One day you’re here, and the next you’re not—no. Sport may be a metaphor for death but death is mostly unlike sport, or the opposite way around. Even the noblest declines have a malingering quality—unavoidable and inevitable, maybe, with a kind of death that presages another life.
"This was probably the worst training camp for me in my career because of the injury," LeBron James told  ESPN on Wednesday morning, before the Cleveland Cavaliers hosted the Indiana Pacers at Quicken Loans Arena. "I didn't get an opportunity to do the things that I like to do and with the summer that I had, I kind of had a setback."
James was talking about a left ankle sprain he suffered in September, that caused him to miss four of the Cavaliers’ five preseason games. It wasn't always this way—so much so that one wonders, as may be de rigeur in 2017, quite which version of the truth to believe. "This is one of the best offseasons I've had in my career," James said on September 26. "And I'm extremely excited."
On Wednesday night the Cavaliers got beaten for the fifth time in eight games this season, by a Pacers team that now lacks Paul George, that’s meant to be shuffling somewhere in the middle of the deck of the Eastern Conference, maybe around that eighth seed at best, certainly craning its neck up at the regal Cavaliers led by their King, James.
"We have an opportunity to be very good and then you see some of the lulls that we have and it's just very difficult on our team right now," James told  ESPN on Wednesday night. "We're just trying to figure it out on the fly. So, our team is kind of depleted as well, both on and off the floor." Tristan Thompson limped out of that Pacers loss with a left calf strain. Isaiah Thomas won’t be seen on a basketball court in Cleveland until January, at the earliest. Kyrie Irving’s Celtics are 6-2, younger, faster, more dynamic than the Cavaliers, further into a rebuild and, maybe, closer to a Championship too. Extraneous, maybe, to anyone who doesn’t have a claim of being the greatest basketball player of all time.
The start of the end comes with little white lies, maybe, to convince yourself that everything is going to be as it always was. Maybe it comes when you find yourself playing on a team that can’t manage defense, regularly giving up more than 100 points, with a starting point guard you can only watch through your fingers. A team that you have to carry at a stage of your career when it should be at least pulling as much weight as your 32-year-old body.
James is averaging 24.6 points per game, 7.1 rebounds and 8.6 assists. James has played all over the court, including at point guard, just to haul the Cavaliers to 3-5.
He hasn’t even begun the great malingering decline. So how bad are the Cavaliers going to be when he does?


There was little surprise when, at the end of last season, as Stephen Curry entered free agency he decided to re-sign with the Golden State Warriors.
Curry had just won his second championship in three years with the Warriors, easing to a 4-1 win in the NBA Finals against  LeBron James and the  Cleveland Cavaliers.
Signing a new deal and committing his future to  Golden State seemed inevitable, and so followed his $201 million five-year contract.
There is, however, a pang of doubt about whether Curry will make it to 2022 with the Warriors, especially after the team refused one of his requests during the negotiations.
Curry wanted a no-trade clause included in his new deal but Golden State declined, according to  Marcus Thompson of  The Athletic, and author of Golden: The Miraculous Rise of Stephen Curry.

The 29-year-old, according to Thompson, also preferred that the fifth year of the deal be a player option. Again, the Warriors refused his request.
Curry, a four-time All Star, has been at the center of the Warriors’ success over the past few years, but the fact he will be 34 by the time his contract expires is clearly in the minds of those at Golden State.
So, are the Warriors considering trading Curry? For the time being, certainly not. After giving him such a bumper contract they now need him to deliver.
The team is sixth in the Western Conference after a slow start to the season with losses to the Rockets, Grizzlies and Pistons. But on Monday they beat the Western Conference-leading LA Clippers with a resounding win at Staples Center.
“Our defensive effort really got us to where we wanted to be,” Curry said, as quoted by  Associated Press. “The coach gave us a challenge before the game to just try and win the possession and field-goal game. Throughout the course of the game, that was the key. We played Warriors basketball and now we have to sustain it.”
On Thursday, they travel to the AT&T Center in San Antonio to take on Gregg Popovich and the Spurs.


In the biggest moment of his career, on the grandest stage, under the brightest lights, Yu Darvish failed in a way that is unlikely ever to be forgotten by the Los Angeles Dodgers, Houston Astros or anyone with even a remote interest in baseball.
Darvish, a four-time All-Star, gave up five runs to the Astros on Wednesday night, bringing to a dramatic conclusion one of the finest World Series in modern collective memory. By the time Darvish was finished, having registered only five outs and failing to complete the second inning—having thrown 47 pitches and given up a home run to George Springer with his 47th and last pitch of the game, “almost certainly the last one he’ll throw as a Dodger,”  ESPN opined while sifting through the debris—the game was pretty much up. Clayton Kershaw came in and pitched four scoreless innings, leading to predictable howls about why he hadn’t started. But the Astros got lights-out pitching all the way through, and their young hitters delivered in the clutch for their first-ever title, leaving the Dodgers to contemplate a 104-win regular season and the biggest payroll in Major League Baseball alongside a loss that will burn, sting and hurt like a deep bruise for years to come.
“Darvish did the unimaginable and inexcusable, following one historically atrocious start with another,” the  Los Angeles Times wrote Wednesday night, when the bruises were still coming up purple all over Dodger Stadium. Darvish went 0-2 in the World Series, his Game 7 debacle following up a Game 3 start where he threw 49 pitches, lasted one-and-two-thirds innings and gave up four runs at Minute Maid Park, where he had a previously impeccable record. The Astros wouldn’t fall behind again in the Series. The man the Dodgers acquired in July to hop them over the hump ended up tripping over his own obstacles.

It happens, doesn’t it? Was it really “unimaginable?” Well, Kershaw pitched a horrible Game 5, as the  L.A. Times noted in the same article. The idea that a human could malfunction under this kind of stress test hardly seems inconceivable. “Inexcusable?” That’s the funny thing about professional sports, a postmodern magnifying glass where everything matters completely, totally, fatally, and simultaneously doesn’t really matter at all. “Games like this can happen to anyone,” the  L.A. Times wrote. Quite. It’s baseball, a game, fun and frolics on a Wednesday night. It’s Game 7, the most important moment of the life of anyone involved, for those hours at least, the hours they will be remembered for forever on film. Schrödinger should have been given a free ticket in the plushest seats at Dodger Stadium on Wednesday evening.
“Everyone has really awful days,” Darvish said, in quotes reported by the  L.A. Times on Wednesday. “When I have an awful day, what I think about is how for every awful day I’ve had, I’ve had a great day and I’ve added another wonderful person to my life. When I think like that, it’s easier. But what I did today affected everyone on the Dodgers, so I don’t know if that’s going to work.”
Even those deep-purple bruises heal. It’s easy to forget—the  Times seemed to—how cruel this Series was on Darvish. In Game 3, he was the subject of a racist taunt from Yuli Gurriel after the Astros first baseman struck a home run off of Darvish. There’s a legitimate question as to whether Gurriel should even have played the rest of the Series; some grim poetry, maybe, in Darvish having to watch on as Corey Seager hit a ground ball to Jose Altuve, who threw to Gurriel to end an epic in seven acts.
“I would like to return here with the Dodgers,” Darvish said after the game. Do the Dodgers have capacity for forgiveness and its second cousin, redemption? With their wounds still open, can they see Game 7 for what it was—a game of baseball? If so, Darvish may get another chance in L.A.


NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell proved Tuesday that he either doesn't understand or won't acknowledge the true cause of the national anthem protests that have drawn President Donald Trump's anger. 
Goodell circulated a letter around the league saying he wanted players to stand during the pre-game national anthem, in effect ending the protests that were first started by quarterback Colin Kaepernick. But something was conspicuously absent from the note sent to all 32 NFL teams—any mention of what the protests are actually about. The commissioner does his best to avoid discussion of police brutality and the oppression of black people in America, instead insisting players are addressing vague "issues."
"I am very proud of our players and owners who have done the hard work over the past year to listen, understand and attempt to address the underlying issues within their community," Goodell wrote in the second paragraph of the letter (emphasis added). 
"We also care deeply about our players and respect their opinions and concerns about critical social issues," he wrote. "The controversy over the anthem is a barrier to having honest conversations and making real progress on the underlying issues. We need to move past this controversy, and we want to do that together with our players."

The letter from Goodell only hints at the larger problem as the protests have garnered more national attention amid Trump's many broadsides. The demonstrations have been cast as a referendum on patriotism, the military, the flag, the anthem, the president or countless other things that were never the point. But, to steal Goodell's phrase, the real issue is, and always has been, the oppression of black people in America.
San Francisco 49er Eric Reid has been taking a knee since just about the time former teammate Kaepernick began the demonstration last year. He has been very clear about what the protests mean. 
"I have the utmost respect for the military, for the anthem, for the flag. So I will say that every time ya’ll interview me," Reid told reporters after his game this weekend, which Vice President Mike Pence walked out of, claiming he was offended by the protesters. "This is about systemic oppression that has been rampant in this country for decades on top of decades. And I will continue to say and encourage people to educate themselves of how we got to where are today, because it didn’t happen overnight."
That's what Kaepernick began kneeling for and what the protests have been about ever since—even if the president inspired more folks to take a stand by calling anyone who kneeled a "son of a bitch."
"I'm going to continue to stand with the people that are being oppressed. To me, this is something that has to change," Kaepernick said when he was first asked about his protest.
But it appears owners, the vast majority of whom are white men, have grown tired of the protests. The Dallas Cowboys' Jerry Jones said he would bench any player who didn't stand for the anthem, and ESPN wrote "many NFL owners have grown concerned about the appearance of unpatriotic acts." The league power brokers are now considering a rule mandating that players stand during the anthem, exactly as Trump demanded in one of his many tweets slamming the NFL.
But even if the kneeling is forced to go, the issues remain. Just don't Roger Goodell what they are. 


After Friday’s victory over Panama, the pressure on Bruce Arena’s USMNT has been relieved somewhat, but they still have one hurdle to jump to reach next year’s World Cup.
On Tuesday night, at 8 p.m. Eastern Time, the U.S. men’s team takes on Trinidad and Tobago in the final game of the qualification stage before confirming their place at Russia 2018.
Arena’s team won the crucial game against Panama on Friday night at the Orlando City Stadium 4-0, with goals from Christian Pulisic, Jozy Altidore and Bobby Wood.

The USMNT leapfrogged Panama and now sits third in the group, in the final automatic qualification place, behind first-place Mexico and Costa Rica which are already through.
Anything but defeat—and even that may be enough—should confirm the USMNT’s place at the World Cup next year. The game is being shown live on television on beIN Sports, with coverage starting at 7.50 p.m., while it can also be streamed at  fuboTV.


Donald Trump launched into a new tack in his battle with the NFL on Tuesday morning, demanding the league’s “massive tax breaks” be taken away if its players keep protesting during the national anthem.
“Why is the NFL getting massive tax breaks while at the same time disrespecting our Anthem, Flag and Country? Change tax law!” Trump tweeted. In another tweet, posted late on Monday evening, Trump had praised Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones for stating that he would not tolerate kneeling while the “Star-Spangled Banner” plays before NFL games.
It’s all part of the long-running dispute Trump has been engaged in with the NFL since he told a rally in Alabama on September 22 that NFL players should be “fired” if they knelt during the anthem. The practice has caught on since it was started by Colin Kaepernick, the former San Francisco 49ers quarterback, at the start of the 2016-17 regular season in protest at police brutality against black people in the U.S.
NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell called Trump’s comments “divisive,” while Trump has continued to retaliate by taking jabs at the league’s television ratings. On Sunday, Vice President Mike Pence left the game between the Indianapolis Colts and San Francisco 49ers at Lucas Oil Stadium early after around 12 49ers players kneeled for the anthem. Trump said in a tweet later on Sunday evening that he had asked Pence to walk out if more protests occurred.
Trump’s latest angle of attack represents a fresh direction for the president; before Tuesday, he had never criticized the league for its tax affairs. And perhaps that should have remained the case. While the league has attracted criticism for using public money for new stadiums—a March 2017 ESPN article said new stadiums and renovations to old ones since 1997 cost the taxpayers $6.7 billion, including the Oakland Raiders’ upcoming transition to Las Vegas, which will come in at almost $1 billion—it has moved in recent years to close up one tax loophole. As fact-checking website  Snopes.com explained, the NFL’s tax-exempt status prior to 2015 applied only to the league central office, which handles the administrative side of the game. The 32 teams themselves, private organizations, all pay tax as normal. Anyway, in 2015, the league office voluntarily gave up its tax-exempt status.
If Trump was making a point about using taxpayers’ money for shiny new billion-dollar arenas, he might have a point. The NFL may have many questions to answer, but its teams do pay taxes. As The New York Times pointed out, any change to the way the NFL pays tax would be “more about symbolism than impact.” Trump, of course, spent in the region of $250,000 flying Pence to Indianapolis on Sunday, apparently to make a political statement. As  Business Insider noted, he also stands accused of wasteful spending of taxpayer dollars for that incident. The president’s latest attack on the NFL was not an entirely successful one.


In less than two weeks, President Donald Trump has tweeted to criticize the NFL on 27 separate occasions.
His issue with the organization began when players started kneeling during the national anthem, a form of protest started by former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick in 2016.
In preseason this year, more players began to take a knee during the anthem, prior to kick-off, which Trump attacked on September 23. At a rally for Republican senator Luther Strange, Trump urged NFL players be sacked for protesting.
“Wouldn’t you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say, ‘Get that son of a bitch off the field right now. Out! He’s fired. He’s fired!’” the president said. But this only led to more players protesting and Trump has taken to attacking the NFL from his Twitter account.

Below,  Newsweek  recaps all of the posts Trump has made in reference to the NFL and its national anthem debate:
Why is the NFL getting massive tax breaks while at the same time disrespecting our Anthem, Flag and Country? Change tax law!
 

 
A big salute to Jerry Jones, owner of the Dallas Cowboys, who will BENCH players who disrespect our Flag.&quot;Stand for Anthem or sit for game!&quot;
 

Referring to the game between the Indianapolis Colts and San Francisco 49ers that Vice President Mike Pence walked out of when players began protesting the national anthem:
 
The trip by @VP Pence was long planned. He is receiving great praise for leaving game after the players showed such disrespect for country!
 

 
I asked @VP Pence to leave stadium if any players kneeled, disrespecting our country. I am proud of him and @SecondLady Karen.

Very important that NFL players STAND tomorrow, and always, for the playing of our National Anthem. Respect our Flag and our Country!
 

 
Spoke to Jerry Jones of the Dallas Cowboys yesterday. Jerry is a winner who knows how to get things done. Players will stand for Country!
 

 
Ratings for NFL football are way down except before game starts, when people tune in to see whether or not our country will be disrespected!
 

 
The booing at the NFL football game last night, when the entire Dallas team dropped to its knees, was loudest I have ever heard. Great anger
 

 
But while Dallas dropped to its knees as a team, they all stood up for our National Anthem. Big progress being made-we all love our country!
 

 
The NFL has all sorts of rules and regulations. The only way out for them is to set a rule that you can&#39;t kneel during our National Anthem!
 

 
Even Usain Bolt from Jamaica, one of the greatest runners and athletes of all time, showed RESPECT for our National Anthem! ____ pic.twitter.com/zkenuAP9RS
 

 
So proud of NASCAR and its supporters and fans. They won&#39;t put up with disrespecting our Country or our Flag - they said it loud and clear!
 

 
Many people booed the players who kneeled yesterday (which was a small percentage of total). These are fans who demand respect for our Flag!
 

 
The issue of kneeling has nothing to do with race. It is about respect for our Country, Flag and National Anthem. NFL must respect this!
 

 
#StandForOurAnthem

If NFL fans refuse to go to games until players stop disrespecting our Flag &amp; Country, you will see change take place fast. Fire or suspend!
 

 
...NFL attendance and ratings are WAY DOWN. Boring games yes, but many stay away because they love our country. League should back U.S.
 

 
Great solidarity for our National Anthem and for our Country. Standing with locked arms is good, kneeling is not acceptable. Bad ratings!
 

 
You can boycott our anthemWE CAN BOYCOTT YOU! #NFL #MAGA pic.twitter.com/ryYzZnXjXE
 

 
Courageous Patriots have fought and died for our great American Flag --- we MUST honor and respect it!  MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
 

 
Sports fans should never condone players that do not stand proud for their National Anthem or their Country. NFL should change policy!
 

 
If a player wants the privilege of making millions of dollars in the NFL,or other leagues, he or she should not be allowed to disrespect....
 

 
...our Great American Flag (or Country) and should stand for the National Anthem. If not, YOU&#39;RE FIRED. Find something else to do!
 

 
Roger Goodell of NFL just put out a statement trying to justify the total disrespect certain players show to our country.Tell them to stand!
 



As if anyone needed another strand to the storyline of LeBron James and Kyrie Irving staring each other down across a court for the first time in Cleveland on October 17, Tyronn Lue may just have provided it.
Lue, the Cavaliers head coach, said Monday he would play free-agent acquisition Dwyane Wade at shooting guard, alongside Derrick Rose, Jae Crowder, Kevin Love and James, in his starting five. Barring injury, that lineup will be expected to take to the court against the Celtics in a week.
Lue’s decision is something of a surprise.  NBA.com noted that Wade, who arrived from the Chicago Bulls at the end of September, had been expected to play point guard for the Cavaliers’ second unit. He filled that role for Lue during the Cavaliers’ preseason training camp. That means J.R. Smith, a regular starter over the past two seasons, is relegated to a bench role.
Wade wasn’t terrible for the Bulls in 2016-17, the first season of his professional career outside of Miami. He averaged 18.3 points per game on a team that shuffled into the playoffs, exactly five ppg lower than his career average, according to  Basketballreference.com. Wade’s statistics have been declining since his career year of 2008-09, in line with what you would expect from an aging star. He’s 35, so it seems unlikely those numbers are going to go up again significantly.
Maybe that doesn’t matter, though—or at least that is what Lue must be hoping. In the Heat’s back-to-back championship years, Wade could rely on James and Chris Bosh to share the scoring burden. Four years on from the “Big Three” winning their last title together, and with James seemingly as good as ever, Lue is attempting to recapture that lightning in a bottle, or at least two-thirds of it. If James and Wade can re-create something approaching their original connection, maybe it won’t mean so much that the Cavaliers are starting a 35-year-old on the downslope of his career in the backcourt.
But then, there are other points of conjecture for the Cavaliers, not least the Derrick Rose question. If and when Isaiah Thomas is ready to play, he will presumably replace Rose at the point in the starting five. But as  The Ringer points out, while Rose starts and Wade plays next to him, the Cavaliers are stuck with two players who would prefer to be creators than scorers, in a league where the three-pointer is increasingly important. It’s a staggering statistic, pointed out by that website, that Rose tried less than one three-point attempt per game last season. The 2017 Cavaliers are basically going to defy everything the Warriors have taught everyone about basketball over the past few seasons. It’s going to be interesting, to say the least.
And even if Rose can stay healthy, James’s desire to be the primary ball-handler looks as if it could create problems. And as  The Ringer notes, perceptively, again—what happens to the Cavaliers defense without Smith, and with one player entering his late 30s and one whose career has been stalled, repeatedly, by injuries? In a week’s time, James will face down his old teammate Irving, leading a team that looks to have more questions about it than answers.


The NFL quietly changed its rules on players protesting the national anthem following a torrent of criticism from President Donald Trump, according to reports.
Trump slammed the organization last month as more and more players took a knee during the anthem prior to games. “NFL must respect this!” he tweeted on September 25, followed the next day by: “The NFL has all sorts of rules and regulations. The only way out for them is to set a rule that you can’t kneel during our National Anthem!”
On Sunday, as Cowboys GM  Jerry Jones spoke to reporters, it emerged that he had spoken to Trump “about an NFL policy in game operations manual that dictates players stand for the national anthem.”
The rule that Jones was referencing was published on Twitter by ESPN’s Chris Mortensen:
.@mortreport referencing @NFL game operations manual policy for national anthem on Monday Countdown. Here it is in full: pic.twitter.com/ifSMYuvOV9

Crucially, it warns that failure to follow these rules “may result in discipline, such as fines, suspensions, and/or the forfeiture of draft choice(s) for violations.” This rule, however, seems to have been altered.

According to  Deadspin, the 2014 edition of the game operations manual—officially named the Policy Manual for Member Clubs—is significantly different when it addresses punishment. It says: “Failure to be on the field by the start of the National anthem may result in disciplinary action from the League Office.”
The version currently being pushed out by the NFL differs in two ways: Firstly, there are increased penalties for not standing for the national anthem, but also the punishment does not have to come from the league office now.
Following the Cowboys’ 35-31 defeat to the Green Bay Packers on Monday, Jones said that “if there’s anything that is disrespectful to the flag, then we will not play,” a move Trump was quick to praise.
A big salute to Jerry Jones, owner of the Dallas Cowboys, who will BENCH players who disrespect our Flag.&quot;Stand for Anthem or sit for game!&quot;

“A big salute to Jerry Jones, owner of the Dallas Cowboys, who will BENCH players who disrespect our Flag. “Stand for Anthem or sit for game!” Trump tweeted Monday night.
It is unclear when the change was made to the language in the manual, and  Newsweek  is yet to hear back from the NFL for comment.


In his seemingly neverending series of skirmishes with the National Football League, Donald Trump at last found support from an old friend.
Jerry Jones, the charismatic oil billionaire and owner of the Dallas Cowboys, performed something of a  volte-face on Monday night, telling  ESPN that his players “need consequences” should they feel the desire to kneel during the national anthem.
Jones outlined those consequences on Sunday night after the Green Bay Packers beat his Cowboys at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas. "If there's anything that is disrespectful to the flag, then we will not play," Jones told assembled reporters. "Understand? We will not... if we are disrespecting the flag, then we will not play. Period."
Jones told  ESPN that the policy of suspending Cowboys players from games if they fail to stand during the anthem is not a new one, and has been in place since last season when Colin Kaepernick, the former San Francisco 49ers quarterback, first began to kneel in protest at perceived police brutality toward minority groups in the United States.
But it still appeared a departure from Jones’s previous stance displayed earlier this season, when he knelt along with the Cowboys players prior to the anthem, before a game against the Arizona Cardinals in Glendale on September 26 on Monday Night Football. Jones and the Cowboys then stood and linked arms for the anthem.
Jones, who donated $1 million to Trump’s inauguration fund, drew praise from the embattled president late on Monday. “A big salute to Jerry Jones, owner of the Dallas Cowboys, who will BENCH players who disrespect our Flag."Stand for Anthem or sit for game!" Trump tweeted. Trump has faced strident criticism since he told a rally in Alabama on September 22 that any NFL player who knelt for the anthem should be “fired.” On Sunday, Vice-President Mike Pence left Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis early after around half a dozen 49ers players knelt during the anthem. Trump explained later that evening in a tweet that he had instructed Pence to leave the game between the Indianapolis Colts and 49ers if “any players kneeled, disrespecting our country.”


Barcelona will consider entering the race to sign Atletico Madrid’s Antoine Griezmann next summer, potentially scuppering Jose Mourinho’s transfer plans once again, according to reports.
Griezmann agreed a new deal at Atletico this summer, following intense speculation that he would leave for  Old Trafford. The Frenchman said it would have been a “dirty move” for him to leave given the transfer ban placed on Atletico that would have prevented it signing a replacement.
So Griezmann stayed, but the move just looked to be delayed. That looked especially true when the club bought Diego Costa back from Chelsea (though can't register him until January), and when Griezmann’s new contract still had the same buyout clause. His move to United still seemed likely.
But now, it seems,  Mourinho has a rival, and an old rival at that. The club he worked for as an assistant, and has come up against frequently throughout his managerial career, is looking to swipe their top target next summer.

According to Spanish newspaper  Mundo Deportivo, Barcelona will meet Atletico’s asking price of £89 million (about $117 million), which United is also reportedly willing to match. So, it may either become a bidding war between the two clubs or Griezmann will have to make a decision between the two.
The 26-year-old Frenchman is believed to be friends with United midfielder Paul Pogba, who reports suggest played a big role in the capture of Romelu Lukaku from Everton in the summer. United, once again, looks an attractive proposition. Although not the three trophies he would have wanted, Mourinho delivered silverware in his first season at the club and took it back to the Champions League. This season, he is already building on that as United sits joint top of the Premier League with  Manchester City.
Barcelona, meanwhile, is top of La Liga with seven wins from seven games in Ernesto Valverde’s first season at the club, but there is uncertainty off the field. Neymar left in the summer for Paris, and it remains unclear whether Lionel Messi’s future lies at the Camp Nou. An opportunity, perhaps, for Griezmann to become one of the leading men at Barcelona. Griezmann will likely have a decision to make.


President Donald Trump told Dallas Cowboys general manager Jerry Jones he’d found a policy from the NFL that dictates players must stand for the national anthem, according to reports.
Last month,  Trump urged owners of  NFL teams to fire any player that  protested during the national anthem, a message which backfired when the numbers of players kneeling and linking arms increased.
But on Sunday, Jones emphatically announced that any players from his team who “disrespected” the national anthem by not standing would not play. “If there's anything that is disrespectful to the flag, then we will not play,” Jones said after the Cowboys' 35-31 defeat to the Green Bay Packers.
Following other teams protesting the national anthem,  Trump reportedly called Jones and repeatedly implored him to prevent the Cowboys from kneeling. On Sunday, Jones spoke about his conversation with the president and revealed how he had advised him on the NFL rules.

According to Brandon George of  The Dallas Morning News, Jones said part of their conversation was “about an NFL policy in game operations manual that dictates players stand for the national anthem.”
Trump said to Jones: “This could have all been resolved.” The NFL rule book may not mention the national anthem, but the game operations manual certainly does.
Speaking to  Sports Illustrated, an NFL spokesperson said: “The national anthem must be played prior to every NFL game, and all players must be on the sideline for the national anthem. During the national anthem, players on the field and bench area should stand at attention, face the flag, hold helmets in their left hand and refrain from talking. The home team should ensure that the American flag is in good condition. It should be pointed out to players and coaches that we continue to be judged by the public in this area of respect for the flag and our country. Failure to be on the field by the start of the national anthem may result in discipline, such as fines, suspensions and/or the forfeiture of draft choice(s) for violations of the above, including first offenses.”
The NFL is not considering fining players or teams who choose to kneel, link arms or remain in the locker room during the national anthem, the spokesman added.
Despite Jones claiming Trump had informed him of this rule, the president didn’t seem to have this view when tweeting, for he said on September 24 that the “NFL should change policy” to force players to stand.


Manchester City is seriously considering making a bid that would almost double the current transfer world record if Lionel Messi doesn’t sign a new contract at Barcelona, according to reports.
Barcelona announced in June that Messi was signing a contract extension that would keep him at the club until 2021. But that is yet to materialize, and the 30-year-old's current deal expires on June 30, meaning Messi could leave the club for free next summer. 
Manchester City isn't willing to take the risk of waiting that long, though, according to Spanish newspaper  AS, which says Pep Guardiola's team is monitoring the situation and could be ready to make a serious bid. So serious, in fact, that the fee being mentioned would shatter a transfer record that was already devastated this summer.
According to the report, City is preparing an offer of €400 million (about £358m/$470m) for Messi in January if he hasn’t agreed to stay with Barcelona by then. That would see the world transfer record almost quadruple in just six months.

In August,  Paris Saint-Germain activated the release clause in Neymar’s contract, paying Barcelona £199 million for the Brazilian forward. The transaction saw the world record more than double following Paul Pogba’s £90 million move from Juventus to Manchester United in summer 2016.
But Manchester City has always had its sights set on Messi. In addition to making the Etihad Stadium look appealing to Pep Guardiola, employing Ferran Soriano and Txiki Begiristain, two former Barcelona executives, was also intended to attract Messi.
The question, however, was whether the Argentinian would ever leave Catalonia, and it remains that way. Since joining the famous La Masia academy as a 14-year-old boy in 2001, Messi has won eight La Liga titles, the Champions League four times, and the Ballon d’Or five times.
It seemed increasingly unlikely that he would ever leave. But with Neymar’s departure and Barcelona entering a new era under Ernesto Valverde, the team’s new manager, the prospect of reuniting with Guardiola in Manchester may appeal to Messi.


The New York Yankees kept alive their season—barely and thrillingly—Sunday night with a 1-0 win over the Cleveland Indians in the Bronx in Game 3 of the American League Division Series.
The victory, secured at Yankee Stadium thanks to a solo home run from Greg Bird, may have kept Joe Girardi in a job, too, for one more night at least.
"I've never worried about my future," Girardi said before the game, quoted by Sports Illustrated. "I worry about other people’s future, but not my own. Whatever happens, happens."
The 52-year-old Girardi, who is out of contract at the end of the season, is under pressure for a variety of reasons and was booed by sections of the crowd during the introductions prior to Game 3.
The crowd’s anger stemmed principally from a decision Girardi made on Friday, which may have cost the Yankees victory in Game 2. 
With the Yankees leading 8-3 in the sixth inning at Progressive Field, the Indians’ Lonnie Chisenhall walked after he was hit by a pitch from Chad Green. Catcher Gary Sanchez pointed out that the ball had hit the end of Chisenhall’s bat, but Girardi opted not to review and then watched as Francisco Lindor hit a grand slam. Yan Gomes walked the game off in the 13th inning.
Giradi had two challenges remaining at the time, but explained his decision after the game in quotes reported by ESPN. He said: "I think about the rhythm and never want to take a pitcher out of rhythm and have them stand over there to tell me he wasn't hit."
Girardi's decision continues to influence the series. The Yankees could, and probably should, be 2-1 up going into Game 4 on Monday night rather than facing elimination at the hands of the powerful Indians.
“There’s a lot of people that are upset with me, and that’s all part of it," Giradi told  Boston.com. "And that’s something that I have to deal with. The only thing I can do is give my best to this team moving forward, and that’s what I’ll do.”
He said he had cleared up any lingering drama with Aroldis Chapman after the closer “liked” an Instagram post calling Girardi an imbecile after Friday’s game. Chapman apologized to Girardi, according to the manager, and said liking the post had been an accident.
It seems strange that Girardi could leave after this of all his 10 seasons, when the Yankees have surprised everyone in baseball, and maybe even themselves, by contending a year ahead of schedule with a young core led by Sanchez, Aaron Judge and Luis Severino, and bolstered by Bird’s comeback from injury.
But  NJ.com did report in the spring that there was a possibility Girardi could leave after this year, to return to the broadcast booth.
In Monday's Game 4, the Yankees will look to prolong his career in the Bronx by one more game again.


Vice President Mike Pence left the NFL game between the Indianapolis Colts and San Francisco 49ers early on Sunday night—apparently at President Donald Trump’s bidding—after around a dozen 49ers kneeled during the anthem.
Pence was ostensibly visiting Indianapolis to honor Peyton Manning, the Colts’ Super Bowl-winning quarterback who had a statue of himself unveiled before the Colts’ overtime victory. The vice-president was Governor of Indiana from 2013 to 2017.
Pence didn’t get to see any of the game, though. "I left today's Colts game because @POTUS and I will not dignify any event that disrespects our soldiers, our Flag, or our National Anthem," Pence  wrote in a series of explanatory tweets on Sunday evening.
“I stand with @POTUS Trump, I stand with our soldiers, and I will always stand for our Flag and our National Anthem.” Trump tweeted about an hour later on Sunday evening that he had orchestrated Pence’s walkout. “I asked @VP Pence to leave stadium if any players kneeled, disrespecting our country,” Trump wrote. “I am proud of him and @SecondLady Karen.” Eric Reid, the 49ers safety, called Pence’s walkout a “stunt” after the game, as reported by Jennifer Lee Chan of  NinersNation.com.
Trump has been engaged in a battle with the NFL and its players since he told a rally in Alabama on September 22 that any player protesting the perceived treatment of black people in the United States by kneeling during the anthem should be “fired.” The practise has caught hold in the NFL since former 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick began to kneel at the start of the 2016-17 season.
Curiously, Pence was never meant to take in the whole of the game.  The Guardian reports that Air Force Two was scheduled to take off from Indianapolis International Airport at 4 p.m. E.T. to get the Vice-President to a political fundraiser in Los Angeles. The Colts and 49ers finished their game, after overtime, after 4.30 p.m. ET.
That, as well as a report from  NBC that the Vice-Presidential pool never got to enter the stadium and was told that Pence could leave the game early, seemed to have angered Democrats who pointed out the potential cost of Pence’s trip. Brian Schatz, the Senior United States Senator from Hawaii,  tweeted, “Wait. This was orchestrated to make a point? That's not an inexpensive thing to do,” in response to Trump’s explanation.
Schatz was probably about right. Totalling up the money spent flying Pence from Las Vegas to Indianapolis and then on to Los Angeles,  CNN calculated the entire trip would have cost around $242,500. Flying from Las Vegas to L.A. would have cost around $45,000. A Pence aide told  CNN on Sunday that the game had been on the Vice-President’s schedule “for several weeks.


Updated | Miami Dolphins offensive line coach Chris Foerster resigned his position after a video appeared on social media showing him snorting white powder. 
The  Miami Herald reported late on Sunday evening that the Dolphins are “aware” of the video. The newspaper cites an unidentified club source as confirming that the man in the video is Foerster, though it is unclear when the footage was taken. But another  Herald source told the publication that the video looked like it had been filmed inside the Dolphins facility.
“I want to apologize to the organization and my sole focus is on getting the help that I need with the support of family and medical professionals,” Foerster said in a statement released by the Dolphins and reported in the Sun Sentinel. 
The video was posted to Facebook late on Sunday by a user named Kijuana Nige, who describes herself as a model from Nevada. “ I really don't do this often but... since it's NFL Sunday let's talk about these coaches folks” Nige posted on her account on Sunday. Introducing Christopher Foerster Miami Dolphin [sic] offensive line coach. Hey honey are you still high.”
In the video Foerster begins by talking to someone off camera. “Hey babe, miss you. Thinking about you. How about me going to a meeting and doing this before I go?” He says. He then snorts one of three lines of the white substance on the table, referencing “those big grains falling” before taking the second line. After snorting the third and final line, the subject of the video raises a finger to his lips with a remnant of the drugs on it and says, “I wish I was licking this off your p****.”

It is unclear whether the video was intended for Nige, although she appeared to claim it was in another Facebook post published in the early hours of Monday morning. “The white people mad at me like I forced blow down this mans nose and like I recorded it on tha low,” she wrote. “No those are his habits and he recorded himself and sent it to me professing his love.” She goes on to draw a parallel between perceived sympathy for Foerster and attitudes towards black players in the NFL.
“We were made aware of the video late last night and have no tolerance for this behavior. After speaking with Chris this morning, he accepted full responsibility and we accepted his resignation effective immediately. Although Chris is no longer with the organization, we will work with him to get the help he needs during this time," the team said in a statement. 
This story was updated on 9 October to include details of Chris Foerster​'s resignation. 


San Francisco 49ers safety Eric Reid has accused Vice President Mike Pence of "a PR stunt" after walking out an NFL game when players kneeled during the national anthem.
Reid, one of the NFL players who began protesting a year ago alongside Colin Kaepernick, was in Indianapolis for Sunday’s game against the Colts, which ended 26-23 to Indianapolis.
Pence made a special appearance at the game but didn’t get to see a minute of play. The vice president rose to his feet for the national anthem, but after seeing members of the 49ers team take a knee he walked out of the stadium.
“I left today's Colts game because @POTUS and I will not dignify any event that disrespects our soldiers, our Flag, or our National Anthem,” Pence wrote on Twitter. But Reid, the 25-year-old from Louisiana, thinks it was all part of a set-up.
“My honest reaction … Does anybody know the last time he’s [Pence] been to a football game?” Reid said, as quoted by  Jennifer Lee Chan of Niners Nation.
“With that being said, he tweeted out a three-year old photo of him at a Colts game so with the information I have the last time he was at a Colts game was three years ago. So this looks like a PR stunt to me.”
 
Statement by @E_Reid35 regarding the Vice President&#39;s brief appearance at the game. &quot;This is what systemic oppression looks like.&quot; pic.twitter.com/Aoy2GWons2
 
Reid continued: “He knew our team has had the most players protest. He knew that we were probably going to do it again. This is what systemic oppression looks like. A man with power comes to the game, tweets a couple of things out and leaves the game with an attempt to thwart our efforts. Based on the information I have, that’s the assumption I’ve made.”
Later, on Twitter, President Trump explained how he had been behind Pence’s departure from the Lucas Oil Stadium. “I asked @VP Pence to leave stadium if any players kneeled, disrespecting our country. I am proud of him and @SecondLady Karen,” he wrote on Twitter.
 
I asked @VP Pence to leave stadium if any players kneeled, disrespecting our country. I am proud of him and @SecondLady Karen.
On Monday morning, he claimed on Twitter that Pence's trip to Indianapolis was "long planned," but the VP was never going to see the whole game, anyway. According to the Guardian, Air Force Two was due to take off from Indianapolis international airport at 4 p.m. on Sunday, while the game finished at 4.30 p.m. after overtime.
Trump has been in an on-going feud with the NFL ever since he suggested players who protested the national anthem should be “fired.” At a rally last month he said: “Wouldn’t you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say, ‘Get that son of a bitch off the field right now. Out! He’s fired. He’s fired!’
“You know, some owner is going to do that. He’s going to say, ‘That guy that disrespects our flag, he’s fired.’ And that owner, they don’t know it [but] they’ll be the most popular person in this country.”
His comments led to mass protests across the sport the following weekend, which looks set to continue through the season.


Barcelona is considering making a move for Manchester United forward Anthony Martial as he struggles to get a start at Old Trafford, according to reports.
Martial has made significant progress under  Jose Mourinho since last season, scoring five goals in nine appearances already this campaign. The statistics are even more impressive given that the 21-year-old has only started four games—and there lies what Barcelona sees as an opportunity.
But despite his quality, Martial has struggled to get into  Mourinho’s starting line-up. Barcelona,  Mundo Deportivo says, believes he is capable of playing at the Camp Nou and will look to take advantage of Mourinho’s reluctance to start him.
The French forward moved to United in the summer of 2015, then under Louis van Gaal, and he impressed at the age of 18, scoring 17 goals in his first campaign in English football.
Related:   Manchester United forward can be better than me, says Thierry Henry
There was friction between the player and his manager last season as Mourinho spoke publicly about Martial’s need to improve: “Do I think Anthony is player with great potential? Yes. Do I think he can play successfully for me? Yes. But he needs to give me things that I like,”  Mourinho said in April.
“We are together for almost 10 months or something like that. The same way I know the players much better now, the players should also know me much better now.”
Martial, as  Mourinho said, has clear potential to thrive in England and Europe’s top leagues, which is a belief shared by his fellow countryman, Thierry Henry.
Henry, the former Arsenal striker who moved to Barcelona, believes Martial could progress to a similar level to him in the Premier League, which saw Henry named PFA Player of the Year on two occasions.
“Anthony Martial is a far better player than I was at that age,” Henry said, as quoted by the  Daily Mail. “He can become a world-class player.”
Henry, now a pundit for Sky Sports, moved from north London to Catalonia in 2007, where he won two La Liga titles and the Champions League in three years at the club.
Barcelona’s blockbuster summer-signing Ousmane Dembele from Borussia Dortmund for £135 million (about $177 million)—after selling Neymar to PSG for £199 million—is injured and expected to be out until the new year.

For the first and only time this postseason, Major League Baseball presents four playoff games in one day on Friday. A double doubleheader of sorts. To help you prepare for the four divisional series (Boston Red Sox–Houston Astros and New York Yankees–Cleveland Indians in the American League, and Chicago Cubs-Washington Nationals and Arizona Diamondbacks-Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League), we present a diamond dozen: 12 players who will most impact the outcomes of these four matchups.
Predictions? We like the Astros and Indians to advance in the AL and the Nationals and Diamondbacks to move forward in the senior circuit.
The 5-foot-6 inch Altuve smote three home runs in Thursday’s Game 1 victory against the Boston Red Sox. He will likely be the shortest Most Valuable Player in baseball since 1952, when Bobby Shantz, also 5 feet, 6 inches, of the Philadelphia Athletics, won the award.
How does the 2011 Cy Young winner, who arrived in Houston in August via trade from the Detroit Tigers, like his new clubhouse? Verlander is 6-0, including Thursday’s Game 1 win, with a 1.35 ERA.
The team leader in home runs (24), RBI (102) and stolen bases (26) would love to celebrate his 25th birthday (a day early) on Friday by evening up the series before it returns to Fenway Park.

Baseball’s most celebrated rookie led the American League in home runs (52) and strikeouts (208) this season. In Thursday’s Game 1 in Cleveland, the 6-foot-7-inch slugger only increased the latter stat, whiffing four times.
The Tribe’s ace is the American League’s presumptive Cy Young winner (it would be his second), as he led the AL in wins (18), ERA (2.25) and WHIP (.869).
In 21 career postseason innings (excluding last year’s World Series), the 6-foot-7-inch southpaw reliever has yet to allow a run. As fans of both the Indians and  Major League know, Miller is about as far from Ricky “Wild Thing” Vaughn as you get.

The Nationals have yet to win a postseason series in three tries since the wild-maned slugger became the bedrock of their lineup. Harper missed most of August and September with a knee injury after slipping on a wet first base while legging out a hit.
The two-time Cy Young winner tweaked his hamstring in his last start, but he should be on the mound for either Game 2 or 3. Another former Tiger, Scherzer has led the National League in strikeouts and WHIP each of the last two seasons.
Overshadowed by his former Rookie of the Year and MVP teammate Kris Bryant, Rizzo led the reigning world champions in home runs (32) and RBI (109).

The most dominant hurler since Sandy Koufax, if not World War II, in the regular season, Kershaw has been abysmal in October. How does a three-time (and possibly soon four-time) Cy Young winner with a career 2.36 ERA have a 4-7 record in the playoffs with a 4.55 ERA?
The Dodgers embarked on a 56-11 tear in June, July and August, and the precocious slugger was the fulcrum behind that machine. Just 22 years old, Bellinger set an NL rookie record with 39 home runs.
Since being traded from Detroit at the advent of August, Martinez has crushed 29 home runs in only 65 games. The Dodgers remember well the four home-run game he had against them on Labor Day in a 13-0 rout.


England officially qualified for the FIFA World Cup 2018 in Russia last night, beating Slovenia 1-0 to top the group with a game still left to play.
Current world champions Germany has also already qualified, along with seven other sides including Brazil, Iran, Japan, Mexico, Belgium, Saudi Arabia, and South Korea.
But other nations are yet to secure a spot and there are upsets on the cards if they do not perform.
The three-time World Cup runner-up is balancing on the edge of qualification for the finals and will need to win all its remaining games to have any chance of making it to Russia next year.
Having won only half of its games so far—having suffered a heavy defeat by France in August—the Dutch team face bottom of the table Belarus tomorrow in Borisov. It should be a comfortable win but Sweden on Tuesday will be a challenging clash that will decide which team secures a play-off position.
The hosts of Euro 2016 lead Group A by only a single point, France will need to secure at least a win on Saturday away to Bulgaria in order to settle manager Didier Deschamps' nerves.
He will be confident in his team, though, with star players such as Kylian Mbappe and Thomas Lemar shining in the Champions League recently.
But the French will have to shake off the last result, a 0-0 draw with Luxembourg, and be clinical on Saturday to increase the pressure on the rest of those in Group A hoping to secure a play-off spot.
If France fails to win the last two games in their group, Sweden and Holland could both pounce and beat the French to Russia.
In a two-horse race with the Spaniards for qualification in Group G, Italy will be desperate for a win against Macedonia.
Gian Piero Ventura can only hope Spain drops points in its last two matches for any chance at winning the group—if the Italians cannot manage a draw at the Stadio Olimpico tonight, the team will not even guarantee second place in the group.
The Euro 2016 champions face Andorra away on Saturday, with three points to make up on Switzerland who lead Group B.
Portugal must at least match Switzerland's result to keep hopes alive of top spot, otherwise they will be staring down the prospect of missing out on the chance to become simultaneous European and World champions.
In what is turning out to be the toughest-fought of all the battles for top spot, the Croatian team is far from securing a place at the finals next year.
Croatia only leads the group with a superior goal difference to Iceland, with Ukraine and Turkey both only two points behind.
The team faces Finland at home tonight followed by a vital encounter in Ukraine on Monday. Iceland plays Turkey tonight but end with an easier fixture against bottom team Kosovo on Monday.
Spain has progressed through the World Cup qualifiers with a point to prove after going out of Euro 2016 at the quarterfinal stage.
They are yet to lose a match going into the weekend and the clash against Albania tonight would provide a comfortable points cushion with only one game remaining.
On the other hand, if Italy win tonight and Spain fail to do so, both nations would be on equal points going into the last qualifier on Monday.
This means that the top spot in Group G is still all to play for and could see one of the European footballing giants face strong opposition in a play-off scenario to secure their path to Russia.
The Swedes are currently second in Group A, a point behind leaders France, and host Luxembourg on Saturday.
If Sweden wins, a top two finish will be confirmed; should they lose and the Netherlands beat Belarus, the Swedes will be on equal points to the Dutch and risk losing out on the chance for a play-off spot and consequently a place in the finals.


The United States Men's National Soccer Team (USMNT) may be 32 places higher than Panama in the FIFA world rankings, but that will count for nothing on Friday night. If Bruce Arena’s team loses, the U.S. will not qualify for next year’s World Cup in Russia.
Panama sits third in the qualifying group, one point and one place above USMNT, and in the final qualifying position, along with Costa Rica and first-place Mexico. The U.S. must beat Panama and then get either a draw or a win from their match against Trinidad and Tobago on Tuesday.
Lose, and it will be the first time the U.S. has not been at the World Cup finals since 1986 in Mexico. Since then, the USMNT has been ever present, reaching the quarterfinal stage in 2002 and the last 16 at the previous two tournaments. 
So the pressure is high on Arena and his team, especially as Panama has no World Cup experience; victory would see Hernán Darío Gómez become the first man to take the country to the finals. 
The game kicks off Friday night at 7:35 Eastern time and is being televised on ESPN2 and Univision Deportes. You can also live-stream the game through fuboTV.

Arena, meanwhile, needs look no further than former U.S. player and current Fox Sports analyst Alexi Lalas for his team talk. Last month Lalas tore into individual members of the team after losing to Costa Rica and drawing with Honduras.

Former Premier League goalkeeper Tim Howard was the first to be criticized by Lalas, who said, “The Belgium game ended three years ago; we need you to save the ball now.” Lalas was referring to the World Cup 2014 quarterfinal, eventually won 2-1 by Belgium, but only after Howard had made the most saves in a single match in World Cup history.
Speaking to Sports Illustrated this week, Howard hit back at Lalas. “He’s been blowing hot air for a long time,” Howard said. “He was an average player. He was a failed GM. And I think he gets the great thing about sports: Now you have an opportunity to get paid for your opinion when you’re finished playing, and it’s a good thing.”
Howard added: “Everyone has an opinion. And I think you have to deal with praise and criticism the same way. If you deal with praise the wrong way, it can be detrimental. This is my 20th year playing as a professional. I’ve gotten criticized a lot. But I’m still doing something right. If Alexi wants to speak to me personally, he’s always around. He can find me. The likelihood is he won’t speak to me personally. But that’s just who he is. He’s a character.”


The New York Yankees can overcome a 1-0 deficit and beat a mighty Cleveland Indians team to make it to the American League Championship Series if Aaron Judge’s bat stays silent.
Some offense from Judge wouldn’t go amiss, though—especially if the Yankees starting pitching continues to be as bad as it has been through the wild-card game and Game 1 against the Indians.
The Yankees got terrible pitching from Luis Severino in the wild-card win over the Minnesota Twins Wednesday; the 23-year-old ace was pulled after one out of the first inning. But the bullpen did a cleanup job, and the offense, led by Didi Gregorius and backed up by Judge, hammered and clawed them out of a hole.
On Thursday the Yankees got bad pitching from Sonny Gray, acquired in July from the Oakland A’s before the trade deadline. In three-and-one-third innings, Gray gave up three runs. “Jay Bruce is the guy that really hurt him,” Yankees manager Joe Girardi told the  New York Post. “Besides that, he pitched pretty well.” Bruce, the former New York Met, struck a two-run home run and drove in three of the Indians’ four runs on the night.
Girardi got a bad Judge, too—not the one who lit up the early season and September, but the guy who struck out so many times in the lean summer months. Against the Twins, Judge struck a memorable line-drive home run, on a good night all around for the Yankees in the Bronx. Against the Indians, he struck out four times in four at-bats—three to the starting pitcher Trevor Bauer, and once to closer Cody Allen.
"That's the beauty of baseball,” Judge told  NJ.com after the game when asked if he could forget his bad night. “You get to go out there again and do it tomorrow. So if we go out there and win, we can forget about today. It's just about learning from today, regroup and get them tomorrow."
The same website also reported Judge had an ice pack on his knee during the interview.
"I thought he had some good swings tonight and he'll be back tomorrow," Girardi said, echoing his star rookie. The difference is Judge and the Yankees have to face the Indians’ ace, Corey Kluber, on Friday. Hitting won’t get easier, at least until Game 3.
They can get offense from elsewhere, of course. Maybe Gary Sanchez can fill the hole if Judge keeps striking out, or Todd Frazier, or Greg Bird, or the phenomenally consistent Gregorius. It’s difficult to shake the feeling, though, that when Judge goes cold, so do the Yankees.
Girardi could do with some fire from his baby behemoth in Ohio on Friday night.


The New England Patriots just about squeezed past the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on Thursday night on the strength of a previously pilloried defense.
That doesn’t mean their worries are over.
The Buccaneers got to Tom Brady repeatedly at Raymond James Stadium, sacking him twice and forcing one fumble. That’s the same defense that came into the game with one sack in three games on the season so far, as reported by WEEI Radio,  which covers Bill Belichick’s team.
“Just football,” the quarterback said when asked about the hits, quoted by  Yahoo Sports. “Just football. I’ll be there next Sunday.”

The phlegmatism is very Brady, very Patriots, very NFL. You take the licks, you struggle back up, you go again next Sunday.
Or do you, if you’re past the age of 40? We’re still less than a year removed from that strange controversy in the spring, when Gisele Bundchen let slip that her husband is not as immune to the stresses and strains and brutality of football as he might appear. “He had a concussion last year. He has concussions pretty much every... I mean, we don’t talk about it. He does have concussions,” Bundchen told  CBS in May.
The NFL could find no record of a Brady concussion in the 2016 season. But the cloak of immunity was lifted, partially, at that point. It was easy, before that, to imagine Brady as he appears on the field, a kind of constantly exhorting cyborg fashioned to play the quarterback position as well as it has ever been played. Now? There’s a vulnerability creeping in. Brady has been sacked 15 times in five games of the 2017 season, according to  Yahoo Sports. He is well on pace to break his record for sacks taken in a season, set in 2001.
It’s not too difficult to work out why Brady is getting hit so often. A pocket quarterback not known for his mobility, and now on the wrong side of 40, he needs to be releasing the ball quickly. But the Patriots’ chronic injury problems at wide receiver mean New England lacks downfield threats. Brady is having to hang around in the pocket, and he doesn’t even have a dominant run game to fall back on and hand the ball off to. He threw the ball 40 times against the Buccaneers; six times fewer than his counterpart Jameis Winston, sure, but still probably too many. Worst of all, Brady is playing behind a struggling offensive line. “There are always things you can fix,” left guard Joe Thuney told the  Boston Herald after Brady had been harried against the Houston Texans. “It’s all about execution, little details here and there. There’s always room for improvement.” It’s one thing taking sacks from the Texans’ fearsome defense, though, and quite another allowing pressure from the Buccaneers.
The Patriots are struggling to win with Brady; had Buccaneers kicker Nick Folk not missed three field goals on Thursday night, they would have dropped to 2-3. Without Brady—if they keep letting a 40-year-old man get hammered to the turf—a season that promised dominance for Belichick and Co. is going to go south, fast.


Carolina Panthers quarterback Cam Newton has issued an apology for his sexist remarks after being dropped by one of his sponsors.
On Wednesday, during a news conference, Jourdan Rodrigue of  The Charlotte Observer  asked Newton a question regarding the route-running of receiver Devin Funchess. Newton began his answer by saying, “It’s funny to hear a female talk about routes.”
Newton received a backlash for his comment, with the N.F.L., the Pro Football Writers of America and The Observer condemning his remarks as unacceptable. Rodrigue also made clear she didn’t find it funny.
Dannon, the yoghurt manufacturer, ended its advertising agreement with Newton, which was soon followed by him apologizing via a video on his Twitter account. Take a look:

“We are shocked and disheartened at the behavior and comments of Cam Newton toward Jourdan Rodrigue, which we perceive as sexist and disparaging to all women,” Dannon's Michael Neuwirth said in a statement, as quoted by  The New York Times. “It is entirely inconsistent with our commitment to fostering equality and inclusion in every workplace. It’s simply not O.K. to belittle anyone based on gender.”
And then came Newton’s apology. “After careful thought, I understand my word choice was extremely degrading and disrespectful to women,” Newton said. “And, to be honest, that was not my intentions, and if you are a person who took offense to what I said I sincerely apologize to you.
He continued: “I’m a man who tries to be a positive role model in my community and tries to use my platform to inspire others, and I take ownership to everything that comes with that. And what I did was extremely unacceptable.”

In the majority of polls rating the best players the Premier League has ever had, Thierry Henry is the last man standing.
One hundred and seventy four goals in 254 appearances is a pretty impressive return, but it was the grace with which the Frenchman played the game that saw him adored by many, even outside  Arsenal.
He won two Premier League titles and three FA Cups with Arsenal, also being named PFA Player of the Year twice, before lifting the La Liga and and Champions League trophies at Barcelona. 
So it will come as quite an ominous message to the rest of the  Premier League when it hears that Henry believes  Manchester United, one of Arsenal’s biggest rivals, has a player with quality that usurps him.
“Anthony Martial is a far better player than I was at that age,” Henry said, as quoted by the  Daily Mail. “He can become a world-class player.”

Martial, who turns 22 in December, has shown his true potential for United this season, scoring five goals already and starting just four games.
Related:   Mesut Ozil identifies three clubs he’d leave Arsenal for–and it won’t please Arsene Wenger
It seems the French forward has responded to his manager’s words, for Jose Mourinho was critical of him at times during the coach’s first season at Old Trafford.
“Do I think Anthony is player with great potential? Yes. Do I think he can play successfully for me? Yes. But he needs to give me things that I like,”  Mourinho said in April.
“We are together for almost 10 months or something like that. The same way I know the players much better now, the players should also know me much better now.
“The same way I know what the players like, I think the players also know what I like. The same way I have to go with the direction of the players, the players have to come in my direction.”
Martial, like many of United’s players, has given Mourinho reason to be pleased this season, and he was rewarded with the club’s player of the month award.


When Arsene Wenger confirmed that Mesut Ozil would not be leaving the Emirates Stadium this summer but that he also hadn’t signed a contract extension, the Arsenal manager seemed to be hopeful that over the next six months he could persaude the German to stay.
If not, Ozil is able to sign a  pre-contract agreement with another club in January and join for free in the summer.
That plan has not gone too well so far. After seven games of the new  Premier League season, Arsenal is fifth, already six points off the two Manchester clubs at the top of the table. It is early days, but as things stand that leaves them out of the Champions League places where they finished last season.
So Ozil looks to be on his way, but he will only leave north London for three clubs, according to  Goal. The 28-year-old would be keen on rejoining  Real Madrid, the Spanish giant he left for Arsenal in 2013, or, alternatively, the other force in La Liga, Barcelona.

There is also one other destination that appeals to Ozil, and that is heading up the M1 to Manchester and reuniting with  Jose Mourinho, who worked with in Madrid, at Manchester United.
The prospect of Ozil, one of Arsenal’s best players, leaving to join United for nothing would drain the blood from any supporter’s face, partially because they remember what happened last time.
Although Wenger and Arsenal for £24 million for Robin van Persie in 2012, the Dutch striker went on to score 26 league goals that guided United to the title, while Arsenal finished fourth.
There is still time for Wenger to convince Ozil to stay. The German likes his life in London and has just bought a new house which suggests he’s not desperate to flee the club, but Wenger doesn’t have long.
After the international break, Arsenal faces Watford at Vicarage Road on October 14 with a chance to get some more points before traveling to Red Star Belgrade in the Europa League. Midweek Europa trips to Serbia will not appeal to Ozil.


On Friday, the USMNT faces an era-defining match. Bruce Arena’s men are teetering on the brink of missing out on next year’s World Cup in Russia and face Panama in the penultimate game of the group.
Panama sits third in the table, one point and place above USMNT, and in the final qualifying position, along with Costa Rica and first-place Mexico. They have to beat Panama and then get either a draw or win from Trinidad and Tobago on Tuesday.
Despite winning the Gold Cup in July, Arena’s men risk watching the 2018 World Cup from the couch, having failed to win their last three qualifying games. Defeat on Friday night would end all hope.
So Arena needs the pep talk of all pep talks. Though, all he needs to do to get his players fired up is show them the clip below, which sees former U.S. player and current Fox Sports analyst Alexi Lalas rant about certain members of the team.

Just hit play, Bruce:

Former Premier League goalkeeper Tim Howard was the first one picked out by Lalas, who said “the Belgium game ended three years ago, we need you to save the ball now.”
Speaking to Sports Illustrated this week, Howard hit back at Lalas. “He’s been blowing hot air for a long time,”  he said. “He was an average player. He was a failed GM. And I think he gets the great thing about sports: Now you have an opportunity to get paid for your opinion when you’re finished playing, and it’s a good thing.
“Everyone has an opinion. And I think you have to deal with praise and criticism the same way. If you deal with praise the wrong way, it can be detrimental. This is my 20th year playing as a professional. I’ve gotten criticized a lot. But I’m still doing something right. If Alexi wants to speak to me personally, he’s always around. He can find me. The likelihood is he won’t speak to me personally. But that’s just who he is. He’s a character.”
But Howard, and the rest of the team, will still need to prove themselves on Friday night. The game kicks off at Orlando City Stadium at 7 p.m. ET and is on ESPN2.

The head of Brazil's 2016 Olympics in Rio De Janeiro was arrested Thursday after it was revealed he had 16 bars of gold stashed away in a Swiss bank. It's alleged Carlos Nuzman was involved in a vote-buying scheme. 
The revelations come after prosecutors from across the globe launched the so-called "Unfair Play" investigation last month.
"In the past 10-22 years of his presidency of the Brazilian Olympic Committee, Nuzman increased his wealth by 457 percent, without a clear indication of [where this came from], as well as maintained a part of his wealth hidden in Switzerland," prosecutors said, according to the Financial Times. "For example, he only declared 16 bars of gold, each weighing one kilogramme… on September 20, 2017, after the start of Operation Unfair Play."

Brazilian and French authorities have alleged Nuzman played a key role in funneling $2 million to former IOC member Lamine Diack, who helped land Rio the 2016 games, ESPN reported. Rio won the games in 2009 with 66 votes in the third round of voting among the IOC members.
"Nuzman was the agent responsible for uniting the different interests, making contacts, oiling the relations and arranging the mechanism for passing the bribes from [former Rio State Governor Sergio] Cabral directly to African members of the International Olympic Committee," the prosecutors' office said after Nuzman was questioned by authorities, according to the Financial Times. 

Just two weeks after being questioned, Nuzman amended his tax forms to add some $600,000 in income.
It's not particularly shocking that the 2016 Olympics have been tainted by corruption charges. The international sporting event, alongside its soccer counterpart the World Cup, has regularly been the subject of various shady plots involving millions of dollars in alleged bribes as well as vast cheating schemes (remember the 2014 doping scandal in Russia?).
Nuzman, 72, who has headed up Brazil's committee since 1995, has denied any wrongdoing. The International Olympic Committee has offered to work with prosecutors, but defended Nuzman.
"The IOC’s Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer has asked the Brazilian authorities for full information in order to proceed with the IOC’s investigation, and has offered the IOC’s full cooperation," the group said in a statement, but added later, "[The IOC] also reiterates that the presumption of innocence prevails."


President Donald Trump is good at golf—but he may be overstating his talent a bit. 
An article published Wednesday by CNBC looked at Trump's golf game, with quotes from legendary golfers like Gary Player and Tom Watson. But it also featured a throwaway line with a pretty remarkable claim. 
"He even holds the title of 'club champion' at each of the 19 courses around the world with his name on it," the article says. 
"I told him that if anyone beats him, he kicks them out. So he had to win," Player joked to CNBC about the titles.

Again, Trump is good at golf—a fair bit of the CNBC article, titled "Golfers Say Trump Has the Best Game of Any President," featured professionals praising his game. But his game isn't perfect. The president is known to have a lot of power off the tee but struggles around the green, where the game requires a deft touch and attention to detail. And winning a club championship is hard. Trump has said it himself.
“You know, I’ve had great success," Trump told Time magazine in 2015. "Even in golf, I’ve won many golf club championships. I don’t know if you guys play golf. But to win a club championship is hard, literally hard. And you have to beat scratch players. You got a lot of good players."
That's true. Elite, members-only clubs feature men and women who have the means to play very frequently at tough courses with the best equipment. Club tournaments are likely chock-full of scratch golfers, who typically shoot par over 18 holes. The CNBC article seems to suggest Trump currently holds a club champion title—an honor that is typically up for grabs every year—at each of his 19 clubs, which would be quite a feat (and likely one with logistical challenges involving quite a bit of travel). Past articles have said Trump claims to have won 18 or so championships total, which would be more realistic if still difficult. 
The Washington Post this year poked holes in his championship boasts. For instance, the paper found that Trump claims the 1999 club championship at Trump International Golf Club in Palm Beach, Florida. But the club didn't officially open until 2000, and the president apparently won the title during a "soft opening" when only a few select members were allowed to compete in the tournament.
The Post article also found that Trump claimed on Twitter that he won the 2013 championship at Trump International but saw on a plaque at the club that the honor actually belonged to a man named Tom Roush. Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks told the Post he actually won the senior championship, which is certainly an accomplishment but not the outright club title. He has apparently won the senior title a few times at his club in Bedminster, New Jersey, as well.

And that gets to the point of the 19-title claim about Trump. It seems a bit outlandish to believe a man in his 70s is hitting the links and thoroughly crushing his younger competition. It's not quite the same as the late North Korean leader Kim Jong Il famously making anywhere from five to 11 hole-in-ones in a single round of golf—but it would be quite an accomplishment on the links.
Maybe Trump has won 19 championships, and one at each of his clubs. It seems quite unlikely he's had the time to hold the title at each of his clubs right now. Like most things with Trump, it seems a layer of bluster conceals the truth. 


Manchester United is set to miss out on would-be free agent Mesut Ozil as the Arsenal man looks most likely to join Inter Milan, according to reports.
Ozil’s contract at the Emirates Stadium runs out at the end of the season, meaning he is free to come to a pre-contract agreement with any club he wishes in January.
On Tuesday,  The Independent reported that  Jose Mourinho was keen on a reunion with Ozil at Old Trafford, a move that would be devastating for Arsenal and Arsene Wenger–and one they could do little about.
But on Wednesday the  London Evening Standard suggested that the German playmaker’s most likely destination is Italy, joining Inter Milan.
Arsenal, the report says, is still in negotiations with Ozil but is not likely to meet his demands of £350,000-a-week. The club is offering him an increase of £110,000, from £140,000-a-week to £250,000-a-week. But Ozil is showing no signs of committing his future to north London.

Last summer, Serie A giant Inter Milan was taken over by Chinese investors Suning Commerce Group, which is expected to lead to considerable investment in the coming years.
It would, however, be a coup for  Mourinho to convince the 28-year-old to join him at Old Trafford. The  Manchester United manager worked with Ozil at Real Madrid from 2010 through 2013, both leaving at the same time for London.
Mourinho returned to Stamford Bridge to become the Chelsea manager, where he took the club to the Premier League title in 2015. Ozil became Arsenal’s most expensive signing at the time.
Arsenal’s attempts to negotiate a new deal with the 28-year-old German have been unsuccessful, and could lose both him and Alexis Sanchez to  Manchester at the start of 2018.
Sanchez’s contract in north London also finishes next summer and Arsenal looks certain to lose him for nothing, despite Manchester City’s deadline day offer of £60 million (about $79 million).

There’s a moment in Youth, director Paolo Sorrentino’s uneven but frequently hilarious follow-up to his masterpiece, The Great Beauty, that seems to sum up the nature of celebrity in the modern age.
“But who were you? Who? That’s what I always ask myself,” Rachel Weisz’s character demands of her father, a once-famous composer now living out the remainder of his days in a strange, sterile Swiss health farm.
The famous become alien even to their closest family members and friends, Sorrentino seems to suggest, let alone to those who seek to peer into their lives from the outside. It’s a theme that seems applicable to Cristiano Ronaldo, the world’s most famous footballer if not one of the world’s most famous faces, period. The public knows a little about Ronaldo, the Portuguese forward who made his name at Sporting Lisbon and Manchester United before magnifying his fame at Real Madrid, many times over. We know he grew up on the small Portuguese island of Madeira, that he dotes over his mother, that he is almost fanatically committed to keeping his body healthy. That he has three children with another on the way, the first born to a surrogate mother in the United States. Glimpses through a frosted window-pane—even a long-form 2016 piece in  GQ seemed designed to show you can get close to Ronaldo, physically, and remain at several arms’ lengths.
Perhaps it shouldn’t be such a surprise that if Ronaldo were ever going to open the window a little more, it should be to the  Players’ Tribune. Sportspeople seem to like Derek Jeter’s publication, and with reason. They can be heard, or read, in their own words; they can transmit the message they want. Sometimes that is a problem in the case of controversies, but it can also produce unexpectedly honest results. With a pen, or keyboard, rather than a microphone and journalist comes a certain increase in freedom, a decrease in tension.
Jeter, the face of the New York Yankees turned Miami Marlins co-owner, has got Ronaldo to divulge details on his life and emotions. In a piece penned for the website and published on Tuesday, Ronaldo indulges in a little Proustian reminiscence about his childhood. “I would look to the sidelines before every match and see my dad standing there alone,” he writes. “Then one day—I will never forget this image—I was warming up and looked over and I saw my mom and sisters sitting together on the bleachers. They looked...how do I say this? They looked cozy. They were kind of huddled close together, and they were not clapping or yelling, they were just waving to me, like I was in a parade or something. They definitely looked like they had never been to a football match before. But they were there. That’s all I cared about.”
“When you lose, it’s like you’re starving. When you win, it’s  still like you’re starving, but you ate a little crumb. This is the only way I can explain it.” Ronaldo writes later in the piece. It’s good stuff—the kind of insight into the mind of an uber-elite athlete that he would never give you on your terms. Ronaldo even gives insight into the most private part of his very private life, his children. “When I was on the pitch after the final whistle [of the 2017 Champions League final won by Real Madrid], it felt like I had sent a message to the world,” he writes. “But then my son came on the field to celebrate with me... and it was like the snap of a finger. Suddenly, the entire emotion changed.”
It’s kind of odd, perhaps, that a former baseball icon got a European football icon to provide more emotion than he ever has in a newspaper interview. This is probably as open as Ronaldo is ever going to be, so make the most of it.


Aaron Judge has accomplished and endured many things in his rookie season with the New York Yankees: 52 home runs, an American League rookie record; a much-publicized slump; highlight reel grabs in the outfield and, on Monday night, a booming line-drive into the bleachers in the Bronx in his first-ever postseason appearance.
That’s saying nothing, either, of Judge’s intangibles: the easy smile, the quiet, confident manner and the aura that his size lends him. Whether or not he is named American League M.V.P., Judge has been the breakout star of baseball in 2017, a superheroic figure for a sport and a league in need of some youthful zip.
The crack of his bat when he smashes a ball in the middle of the plate is probably the loudest thing about Judge, a reserved character whose political views remain a source of mystery at a time when professional sport in the United States is humming with the spirit of political and social rebellion. The National Football League has found itself at the epicenter of the debate over the treatment of black Americans by police, after San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick began kneeling during the National Anthem last October. President Donald Trump’s remarks at a rally in Alabama on September 23 that NFL owners should “fire” anyone choosing to kneel seemed to unite the league against him, as well as provoking arguments over the place of the NFL, and professional sport, within social justice movements.
Type “Aaron Judge and politics” into Google, though, and you get nothing. Judge, who was adopted as a child and who is listed by a June 2013 MLB article as African-American, has said nothing about the great issue currently meshing sport and politics together in the U.S.
Conservatives seem to have picked up on Judge’s apparent reluctance to speak out. A  National Review article published on Tuesday with the headline, “A Judge Both Conservatives and Liberals Can Admire” listed his feats as usual before moving on to his politics, or lack of it. “In a time where sports has become politicized on both the left and the right, Aaron Judge has remained refreshingly above the fray,” the piece read. “Aaron Judge is the one judge in this country that both conservatives and liberals can unite behind, except of course for those who are Boston Red Sox fans.”
Judge’s silence may be less his own than MLB’s in general. In an interview with  GQ magazine published on Tuesday, Gary Sheffield lamented the declining number of African-American players in professional baseball. “When I was a kid, you had all these guys, athletes like Jim Brown, Muhammad Ali, and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, following Dr. Martin Luther King. I’ll only speak for baseball, but nowadays we don’t have an Ali,” Sheffield said. “We don’t even have the  personalities of my generation and the one before me. Baseball has become so soldier-like, bow your head type stuff.” Only Oakland A’s catcher Bruce Maxwell has taken a knee so far of all the players in MLB.
Of course, there is no obligation for Judge to say what he thinks. His job is to crush baseballs, a job he continues to do extremely well. As his fame grows due to his on-field accomplishments, though, the man waking baseball up with his bat may come under increasing pressure to be woke off the field, too.


Bizarre advertisements for Fox Sports 1 caught the attention of many taking the 42nd Street shuttle between Times Square and Grand Central Terminal in New York this week, but one man took particular offense.
Pictures of  New York Knicks duo Tim Hardaway Jr. and Joakim Noah, who in 2017 will earn $16.5 million and $13.4 million, were featured on the sides of the train next to the word "hopeless."
Once on the train, there was more. One seat featured a sign that said: “Sit here if you’re hopeless,” while another said, “The high point of the last 25 years was the movie Eddie,” referring to the 1996 film in which fan Whoopi Goldberg is named as the Knicks coach.
A third seat with a print on it sent a very direct message: “Nothing will change until Dolan sells the team” in reference to Knicks owner James Dolan. And it seems to have caught his attention. According to  SNY’s Adam Zagoria, Dolan was “furious” and called Rupert Murdoch, Executive Co-Chairman of Fox Sports parent company 21st Century Fox, directly to complain.

Maybe this is like Triangle marketing... pic.twitter.com/3DVfNBIKCL
 
The campaign was meant to last four weeks, the  New York Post reported, but came to a premature end on Tuesday evening after Dolan’s complaint.
Fox bosses found themselves “dealing with a shitstorm internally,” an industry source told Zagoria. “If you post something like this you have to expect Dolan’s wrath.” In the end, the Fox campaign lasted little more than 48 hours.

It wasn’t all doom and gloom, however. Players like Kristaps Porzingis, Michael Beasley and Mindaugas Kuzminskas were presented as the light at the end of the tunnel for the Knicks. The word "hopeful" appeared next to their photos.
The Knicks haven’t won a Championship since the 1970s, when two-time Most Valuable Player Willis Reed led the team to victory.
The preseason began for the Knicks on Tuesday night with a 115-107 loss to the Brooklyn Nets. They play four more times before the regular season begins against the Oklahoma Thunder, when they come face-to-face with the just-traded Carmelo Anthony once again.

Supporters of Arsenal Football Club may have yet another reason to be grumpy. 
Arsenal’s largest shareholder, Stan Kroenke—who also owns several U.S. sports franchises, including the Los Angeles Rams—has made a bid of around £525 million ($696.7 million) to buy out Alisher Usmanov, the second-largest shareholder at Emirates Stadium, according to  The Guardian newspaper.
Kroenke owns 67 percent of Arsenal’s shares while Usmanov, the Uzbek-born Russian billionaire, has a 30.4 percent stake. If Kroenke is successful in buying out Usmanov he will own 97.4 percent of the club, with the remaining 2.6 percent belonging to minority shareholders, many of whom have long-standing interest in the club handed down through generations according to  The Guardian.
Kroenke, who also owns the Denver Nuggets, Colorado Avalanche and Colorado Rapids of Major League Soccer, would potentially be in a position to buy up the remaining shares should Usmanov accept his offer of £28,000 per share, making Arsenal a private business.
Usmanov has previously tried to outmanoeuvre Kroenke to increase his own stake in the club. The Telegraph reported in May that Usmanov had made a $1 billion bid to buy Kroenke’s shares. Usmanov was described by the newspaper at the time as “increasingly frustrated” at his lack of influence over the north London club.
The attempt by Kroenke to buy out Usmanov not likely to go down well with Arsenal fans. The move to Emirates Stadium from Highbury in the summer of 2006 was meant to ensure the club remained one of English football’s superpowers. But Arsenal has not won the Premier League since 2004 and is not playing in the lucrative Champions League this season, having finished fifth in England’s top division in 2016-17.
While Manchester United, one of Arsenal’s great rivals, has mostly prospered since the Glazer family took control in 2005,  The Guardian claims a similar move from Kroenke would be “troubling,” as the American would no longer need to hold A.G.M.s or publish accounts and could also leverage debt against the club.
Kroenke’s interest in Arsenal has raised considerable interest in the U.S. that is certain to increase should he assume full control. A  USA Today piece from October 2016 described Kroenke as “even more of an enigma” in the U.K. than in the U.S.
Still struggling to regain its form and success of the early 21st century on the pitch, Arsenal may now be forced into more upheaval off it.


One of the wealthiest women in the world has reportedly become the newest owner of an NBA team. Laurene Powell Jobs, the billionaire philanthropist, has bought a stake in Monumental Sports & Entertainment which controls the NBA's Washington Wizards and NHL's Capitals, according to The Washington Post.
Her investment, said to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars, will see Powell Jobs own 20 percent of Monumental, the second largest stake after Ted Leonsis. Though the deal is yet to be approved by the NBA and NHL, Powell Jobs is set to become one of the most influential women in sports.
She would be only the fourth female NBA franchise owner, joining Jeanie Buss of the Lakers, Ann Walton Kroenke of the Nuggets, and Gail Miller of the Jazz. 
On March 18, 1991, Laurene Powell’s surname got a little longer, adding what would become one of the world's most well-known names: Jobs. She married Steve Jobs, the late chief executive and co-founder of Apple Inc. who died in 2011, and much of her $20 billion fortune comes from her stock in the company.

According to the Post’s report, Powell Jobs also owns four percent of the Walt Disney Company. This vast wealth has allowed her engage in philanthropic work. In 2004, she launched Emerson Collective, which is an organization “dedicated to removing barriers to opportunity so people can live to their full potential.”
It focuses on education, immigration reform, environmental issues and social justice. Earlier this summer, Emerson Collective also bought a majority stake in The Atlantic  magazine, sharing ownership with David Bradley. The name Emerson Collective, Powell Jobs says, was inspired by the co-founder of  The Atlantic, Ralph Waldo Emerson.
“What I loved about Laurene from the first is that her confidence was forged on a different coast,”  Bradley said. “And, if anything, her ambition is greater than my own.”
Owning an NBA franchise has clearly been a target for Powell Jobs. A few years ago, she reportedly launched an ultimately unsuccessful bid for the L.A. Clippers and, according to NetsDaily, she was also interested in purchasing the Brooklyn Nets in 2015. Fortunately, for Powell Jobs, she looks to have been more successful this time round with the Wizards, valued at $1 billion in 2015 but likely to be worth more now.
Her desire to get involved in an NBA team is intended to help drive forward the Emerson Collective goal. “Laurene and Ted share the same commitment to a double bottom line, that the best companies are those that do good in their communities,” a source told the Post.


Luis Severino dug the New York Yankees, and himself, a hole on Monday night in the Bronx.
The Yankees’ mix of young sluggers and veterans dug them out of it, seeing off the Twins in a raucous American League wild-card game 8-4. After Severino gave up three runs for one out and was pulled without completing the first inning, Didi Gregorius hammered a home run to even up the score at 3-3.
Brett Gardner, the longest-tenured Yankee on the roster, hit his own home run in the second inning to put his team ahead, waking up a crowd that had been stunned by Severino’s struggles.
And then, in the fourth inning, Judge hammered his name into MLB postseason history. The 25-year-old took a pitch in the center of the plate from Jose Berrios, who had replaced a struggling Ervin Santana, a line drive that went low and hard into the front rows of the bleachers.
"He's just very intimidating—the size and the strength," Twins manager Paul Molitor said post-game in quotes reported by  ESPN. "There's just a very small margin of error."
Judge exploded out of the blocks early in the season but slowed down markedly after he won the 2017 Home Run Derby at Marlins Park in Miami on July 10.
He found form, though, in the final weeks of the regular season and ended with 52 home runs to lead the American League. That feat broke Mark McGwire’s previous American League rookie record of 49, set in 1987 for the Oakland Athletics. With his home run on Monday, Judge became only the third rookie in Yankees history to homer in his postseason debut, according to  Elias Sports Bureau.
The Yankees move on to a five-game Divisional Series matchup against the Cleveland Indians, which begins at Progressive Field on Thursday. It remains to be seen whether Severino gets another start in Game One. Judge, though, looks set to take over the postseason as he did in the regular part of a remarkable rookie campaign.



Real Madrid is considering making a £177 million (about $235 million) offer for Tottenham striker Harry Kane next summer, according to reports in Spain.
Kane has stood out as one of the most prolific players in the Premier League in recent years, finishing the last two seasons as top scorer. The  England striker, who only turned 24 in July, has scored 13 times in his last eight games for club and country.
Such numbers are reminiscent of only two players in world football: Real’s  Cristiano Ronaldo and Barcelona’s  Lionel Messi. Messi is the only player to have more goals than Kane this season in Europe’s top leagues.
According to Spain’s  Don Balon, Kane’s continuous prolificity has caught the attention of the Madrid and they will not be scared off by a €200 million price tag, which equates to about £177 million.

Kane signed a new deal at  White Hart Lane in December, which would keep him at the club until 2022, but his wages only reach £120,000-a-week–relatively low for a player of Kane’s ability.
He would, also, not be the first player to trade the Lily White of Spurs for the Los Blancos of Spain. Four years ago, Gareth Bale became the most expensive footballer in the world when he signed for Madrid from Tottenham for £86 million, joining Luka Modric who had made the same move a year before.
Both have thrived since signing, winning the Champions League three times, La Liga once and a Copa del Rey. While Spurs has improved dramatically under  Mauricio Pochettino’s guidance, becoming one of the most complete team’s in English football, the Argentine is yet to win any silverware.
Spurs chased Leicester City for the majority of the way in 2016 before falling away in the last weeks of the season, finally finishing third. Then, Pochettino’s team was the only competition for Chelsea throughout the last campaign, ending as runner-up.
Kane’s importance to the team is clear, scoring a third of the team’s goals last season and half so far for this campaign. The lure of silver in Madrid is strong for most players, but Tottenham will, once again, be desperate to resist.


As the face of the New York Yankees for so many years, Derek Jeter built a legacy on being able to deliver repeatedly in high-pressure situations.
Now Jeter finds himself in another, if very different, high-pressure situation as the Miami Marlins co-owner. And it sounds as if he’s going to try and put those clutch, Hall of Fame nerves to good use.
In a series of essays for the  Players' Tribune, the publication he founded, Jeter laid out a general blueprint for how he plans to run a franchise that was touched by tragedy last year with the death of Jose Fernandez, and finished the 2017 regular season with a losing record.
Jeter and controlling owner Bruce Sherman led the investment group that made the $1.2 billion purchase from Jeffrey Loria, who oversaw eight straight losing seasons in Miami—the longest streak in Major League Baseball.
“The way I see it, doing things the right way, over and over, leads to sustained success,” Jeter wrote on Tuesday. “I’m not just talking about wins and losses—winning games is very important to everyone—but also about developing a winning culture throughout the organization. That’s what is most important, and that journey starts today. It will not happen overnight. But our ownership group is focused on building a team that this community can be proud of.
“The next era of Marlins baseball begins now. Let’s have some fun—it’s the Miami way.”
Alongside Jeter’s piece, the  Players Tribune' published a photo essay of a mostly-smiling Jeter on his first day at work as co-owner. In one, Jeter signs a ball for a small boy in a Giancarlo Stanton jersey.
The timing is interesting, for sure. The decision over whether to trade Stanton, the probably National League M.V.P. and MLB home-run king this season, is the most pressing on-field challenge Jeter faces. Stanton slugged at a historic rate in the 2017 season, hammering 59 homers.
But the face of the franchise, as Jeter was in New York, has that vast $325 million contract tying him to the Marlins through the 2029 season. “I don’t want to rebuild… I’ve lost for seven years,” Stanton told  FanRag Sports last Friday, on a weekend when he could have broken Roger Maris’s mark of 61 home runs in a season. In an article published on Tuesday,  Yahoo Sports noted the debt the new Marlins ownership has taken on, claiming that Jeter will look to slash the payroll and naturally enter a rebuild. In which case, Stanton’s contract no longer fits in Miami. Of course, with a full no-trade clause it’s Stanton’s decision where he goes, if he goes.
Interesting timing, too, on the day the young, rebuilding Yankees play the Twins in the Bronx in the American League wild-card game. The Yankees look to have a core in place now with Aaron Judge, Gary Sanchez, Luis Severino and Greg Bird. The Marlins can’t hope to accomplish the same, really, unless they trade Stanton.
It’s unlikely someone as savvy as Jeter would use Stanton’s name in a picture, on his own publication no less, without some kind of significance behind it. Perhaps he stays; more likely he goes—either way, it’s a decision that will define the first part of Jeter’s tenure.


God bless Joel Embiid. He's a fun-loving dude who seems to create that fun wherever he goes. 
If Embiid isn't dancing, he's either sleeping, training or playing basketball—I don't think he walks, he just dances from place to place. The massive Philadelphia 76er center cracks jokes on the regular—he nicknamed himself "The Process" in homage to the motto "Trust the Process" adopted by diehard Philly fans and listeners of the hit Sixers podcast The Rights to Ricky Sanchez. And oh, if he's healthy—which granted, is a big if—Embiid is an absolute monster on the basketball court. In short: right now, there's nobody as beloved in Philly as Embiid—it's hard to overstate the level of beloved-ness. It's like he has gone out of his way to ensure he's exactly the star the town has been craving. (If you can't tell, I grew up outside of Philadelphia and I'm well acquainted with Embiid's story and Philly fans.) 
So, folks in Philadelphia predictably got excited when the seven-foot center was spotted on a somewhat random jog through the city late at night Monday. Embiid is slowly returning to full health after suffering a knew injury last year, hopefully to return to the team for the start of the regular season later this month.
A Lyft driver captured Embiid running through streets—a la fictional Philly hero Rocky—with a dash-cam video. According to the time stamp on the dash camera, this happened at about 9:15 p.m. Monday night. 
Sports Illustrated's Twitter account uploaded the video (credited to Evan Bowen-Gaddy's YouTube channel), which begins with Embiid and another unidentified person running through an intersection, entering the frame of the Lyft dash-cam video out of nowhere.
The Lyft driver, clearly excited, only manages to say, "YO!" as Embiid crosses through the street. From there, according to the text of the video, the driver got a pick-up request that happened to be in the same direction as Embiid. He rushes that way, slowing down behind a driver in a truck who appears to be chatting up the Sixer. "I panic... and say the only words I know" reads the text of the video. 
"Yo, trust the process," yelled the driver, to which Embiid raised both his hands triumphantly. "I love you!"
Read the text of the video, "Pure happiness." 
Watch the video in the embedded tweet below (also if you have more video of Embiid running or doing pretty much anything, hit me up at @timmarcin on Twitter or email t.marcin@newsweek.com.)



Jose Mourinho is planning to make a move for Arsenal midfielder Mesut Ozil in January which would see him move to Old Trafford for free in the summer, according to reports.
The  Manchester United manager worked with Ozil at Real Madrid from 2010 through 2013, and is highly confident about convincing him to join him in the north west of England,  The Independent says.
Ozil, who joined  Arsenal in 2013 for a then club record fee, is free to speak to any club in January as his contract at the Emirates Stadium will expire in the summer.
Arsenal’s attempts to negotiate a new deal with the 28-year-old German have been unsuccessful, and could lose both him and Alexis Sanchez to  Manchester at the start of 2018.
Sanchez’s contract in north London also finishes next summer and Arsenal looks certain to lose him for nothing, despite Manchester City’s deadline day offer of £60 million (about $79 million).

Reports in the summer suggested City forward Raheem Sterling had been part of the deal proposed to Arsenal, as a cash-plus-player offer.
But now Arsene Wenger looks in danger of losing two key players for free.
It would not be the first time the French manager saw his best players move to Manchester. In 2012, Arsenal sold Dutch striker Robin van Persie to United for £24 million, and he went on to win the Premier League title and the Golden Boot in his first year at Old Trafford.
Manchester United, meanwhile, is joint top of the Premier League table with neighbour City heading into the international break. Mourinho’s team has scored an average of three goals a game in the first seven fixtures, conceding just twice.
Arsenal has begun to recover from a poor start to the season with back-to-back victories against West Brom and Brighton and Hove Albion. 


Ever since Carmelo Anthony was traded to Oklahoma City Thunder last week, there has been one question on the mind of Knicks fans.
Who, they want to know, will replace  Anthony as the new star forward in New York and help propel  the Knicks back up the Eastern Conference? They will be pleased to hear, then, that Jeff Hornacek has a man in his team with the qualities of  Kevin Durant, equal with  LeBron James and “up there with the best guys in the world.” Michael Beasley says that man is Michael Beasley.
The 28-year-old small forward signed with the Knicks at the beginning of August after just a year with the Milwaukee Bucks. He says he is underestimated.
"[It's] mostly perception. As far as talent-wise, I match up with Kevin [Durant], LeBron, I match up with the best guys in the world," Beasley told  Bleacher Report. "I'm not being cocky, it's just always how I felt. But I got into trouble as soon as I got into the NBA, and it left a bad taste in a lot of people's mouths."

In nine years, Beasley has already played for 10 teams, including three stints with the Miami Heat, where he started his career. He was with the Timberwolves for two years, and then spent a year with the Phoenix Suns. Beasley also spent time in China, playing for the Shanghai Sharks and Shandong Golden Stars before returning to the U.S. in 2016.
He joined the Houston Rockets in March 2016 but was traded to the Bucks seven months later, before making his move to New York two months ago. His record, he says, shows his quality but he has never been given a fair chance.
"If you look over the past nine years, I never played more than 24-25 minutes a game,” Beasley said. “Being a No. 2 pick, especially in my first 3-4 years, that should raise a question mark. Not to toot my own horn, but not a lot of guys come into the NBA after the kind of year I had at Kansas State. For whatever reason, I just never got a fair shake."
He may be given his first opportunity in Hornacek’s team on Tuesday night when the Brooklyn Nets are the Knicks’ opposition at Madison Square Garden. Hornacek’s team then plays four more preseason games before the regular season begins on October 20 against the Thunder.


Remember what happened when Zaza Pachulia landed on Kawhi Leonard’s precious left ankle on Sunday, May 14, 2017 at Oracle Arena in Oakland?
Leonard, the two-time All-Star, two-time All-NBA, two-time Defensive Player of the Year, limped off with eight minutes remaining in the third quarter of the Western Conference Finals Game One against the Golden State Warriors, with the San Antonio Spurs leading by 25 points.
What happened next was accurately, if tangentially, captured by Spurs head coach Gregg Popovich in his post-game words. Bear in mind that Popovich—an articulate, reasonable, not to mention woke soul—had a whole night to sleep off his anger. "Who gives a damn about what [Pachulia's] intent was?” Popovich said in quotes reported by  Sports On Earth. “You ever hear of manslaughter? You still go to jail, I think, when you're texting and you end up killing somebody, but you might not have intended to do that…A two-step, lead-with-your-foot closeout is not appropriate. It's dangerous, it's unsportsmanlike. It's just not what anybody does to anybody else. And this particular individual has a history with that kind of action."
Popovich was angry with Pachulia, of course, but also with what Leonard’s absence would mean for the Spurs. Without Leonard on the court, Popovich watched that lead evaporate. Without Leonard for the series, the Spurs were swept 4-0, bounced from the Western Conference’s exclusive club without ceremony.
And now the Spurs are without Leonard again, for the whole preseason, The Washington Post reported over the weekend. The 26-year-old has what is described as a “lingering” quadriceps injury. “We’re not going to put a timetable on it,” Popovich said on Saturday. “But he’s working at it, and we’ll get him back as soon as we can.”
With Leonard’s extraterrestrial two-way game, the Spurs have a chance of upsetting the Warriors in the playoffs. History, frustratingly, won’t tell us what might have happened in Game 1 had Leonard not gone down but logic suggests the series would not have turned into a procession for the Warriors.
Without Leonard, and as well-coached as they are, the ageing Spurs look a step or several behind the Western Conference’s monoliths. The Rockets, to name but one, re-tooled in the summer after the Spurs edged by them in the semifinals in May—a series in which Leonard took over. Popovich needs his All-Star back, as soon as possible.


Despite starting preseason with two defeats, Luke Walton and the Lakers are not feeling too down about their prospects this season after Lonzo Ball starred in his first games for the team. He does, however, have some room for improvement.
Lakers lost their first game 108-99 to the Minnesota Timberwolves on Saturday and were then beaten by the Denver Nuggets on Sunday.  Ball, the 19-year-old point guard who has been described as the “new face of the Lakers,” scored five points, made eight assists, seven rebounds and two steals against the Timberwolves.
Although the youngster is already exciting  the Lakers fans, Walton wants him to improve on his quality in and around the basket, and actually be more selfish.
“Lonzo is so gifted as far as the way he always makes everyone on the court a threat," Walton said, as quoted by  ESPN. "With him, we have been working on that. He is so unselfish that sometimes he has good shots for himself and he tries to get someone else a shot. We want him taking those.
Related:   Lonzo Ball, Lakers big hope, seems to think he’ll go down in NBA history
"We are looking for him to be a little more aggressive to score the ball, especially early on. I thought he was great the way he was moving around out there and getting people involved."
The rookie did, however, receive a standing ovation from  the Lakers president of basketball operations Magic Johnson, who has been effusive over Ball ever since he signed in the draft.
Take a look:

After Ball signed for the Lakers in June, Johnson said the point-guard reminded him of himself, saying they had the same “basketball IQ.”
“I'm going to put a little pressure on you right now," Johnson said to Lonzo Ball. "You look to your right, there's some jerseys hanging on that wall. We expect a Ball jersey hanging up there one day, all right? Good."
Walton, for now, is the man charged with getting him there. Ball has some work to do yet with six games to go until the regular season resumes on October 20 against the Clippers.

The NFL’s last unbeaten team in 2017 is a franchise with one playoff victory since January 8 1994.
The Kansas City Chiefs maintained stayed perfect on Monday night when Alex Smith calmly took his offense for a late field goal to see off the talented but error-riddled Washington Redskins.
CBS put it neatly in its post-game wrap-up: “The Patriots’ defense stinks, the Seahawks’ offensive line is a catastrophe, the Packers always need their quarterback to perform like a god, the Falcons have been playing down to their level of competition… the Chiefs have been the lone exception.”
In a league where all the supposedly elite teams have at least one major flaw, the Chiefs have reached 4-0 by doing everything pretty well.
The receivers, led by Tyreek Hill and Travis Kelce, are excellent. The defense, when fully healthy, can be great. Special teams, and in particular the return game again led by Hill, are dangerous. The quarterback, as he showed on Monday night, is rarely less than good.
They get good coaching—outside of the playoffs at least—from Andy Reid and Bob Sutton, one of the NFL’s sharpest defensive minds. The running game now looks borderline elite with the emergence of Kareem Hunt.
But it is the absence of major mistakes that is allowing the Chiefs to win tight games. The Redskins, with an inarguably more talented quarterback in Kirk Cousins and a talented defense, tripped themselves up on Monday with penalties—head coach Jay Gruden admitted as such. The week before, Philip Rivers threw three interceptions at StubHub Center, while Smith did not turn the ball over. The Chargers—and the Redskins, for that matter—can seem like the reverse of Reid’s group, repeatedly finding ways to lose.
That a mid-market, fiscally prurient franchise—outside linebacker Justin Houston carries the heaviest cap hit this season at $22.1 million—can lead the NFL will please the league’s powerbrokers, including Commissioner Roger Goodell.
Good drafting means key offensive players like Hill and Hunt are on comparatively tiny contracts, allowing money to be spent on the defense and Smith. Even then, Smith will earn the 15th-highest salary of all franchise quarterbacks this season, at $16.9 million. That’s less than the injured Sam Bradford, Eli Manning, Rivers and Carson Palmer, whose vast deal looks a weight around the Cardinals’ neck. Kelce, locked in through 2021, is surely on one of the NFL’s best contracts. The tight end will make $5,418,400 this season according to  SpotRac .
But it seems a good bet that despite all that the Chiefs will come unstuck in the playoffs, possibly in the AFC Championship game against the Steelers. At this rate, the Patriots could also lurk as a nasty wild-card team. Still, they may be showing the league’s rich, talent-stocked and underperforming franchises a safer, more solid way forward in the strange, topsy-turvy world of the NFL in 2017.


Kyrie Irving got his first outing in a Celtics uniform at TD Garden on Monday night, a 94-82 win over the Charlotte Hornets at TD Garden in Boston.
Irving’s Celtics debut was solid—though it was strange to see him in green-and-white and not lining up next to LeBron James in red-and-yellow.
Along with Gordon Hayward, the Celtics’ major free-agent summer acquisition and a man also making his debut, the Celtics had a very different look from the team that lost to the Cavaliers in the Eastern Conference finals at the end of May.
Irving, who was benched along with Hayward for the second half, has been pretty quiet since  that trade in August that sent Isaiah Thomas, beloved in Boston, to the Cavaliers along with a draft pick that relies on the Brooklyn Nets playing down to expectations.
Even in his  ESPN First Take interview with Stephen A. Smith and Max Kellerman, Irving was careful to keep his criticism of James, the Cavaliers and their coaching staff veiled. The nearest Irving came to outright criticism of James was when he described the leaked trade news as “hurtful.” (Smith had  previously claimed Irving’s camp believed James had leaked the news).
Irving’s apparent shot at James on Monday night was in the same vein. The point guard wore a cap after the game that read, “Popularity contests are not truth contests,” in a video posted to YouTube by the Boston Globe’s national NBA writer Gary Washburn.

Irving and James meet on opposite sides of the court for the first time on October 18 when the Cavaliers visit the Celtics in the NBA season opener at TD Garden. Perhaps only then will the weird passive-aggressiveness stop.


As the Knicks prepare to begin their preseason on Wednesday, there seems little to be excited about in New York.
The team lost  Carmelo Anthony last month, traded to the Oklahoma Thunder in return for Enes Kanter, Doug McDermott and a second-round pick for the 2018 draft. There isn’t much optimism over the deal.
And that comes after a season in which the Knicks had the 23rd worst defense in the league, with a points differential of minus 3.7. But coach Jeff Hornacek is pretty certain he knows why.
Last year,  Hornacek left the defensive organization to the veteran players in his team, giving them the opportunity to determine the opposition. That didn’t work out so well, so Hornacek and his staff have learned from their mistakes.
Related:   Carmelo Anthony has left New York, so do the Knicks have a plan in place?
“We're not doing that this year," Hornacek said, as quoted by  ESPN. "When we go to shoot around that (defensive) plan will be in place. We'll know the adjustments, instead of trying to give the guys the idea, ‘Hey, you guys play, you guys know these guys. What's the best way to do it?'"
Hornacek suggested the errors last season may have been down to him, but insisted the Knicks have spent this summer focusing on defensive work.
"I played on teams that had great veteran players,” he added. “We had a basic thing, but most of the time it was, ‘Okay, I'm going to be doing this, you're going to be doing this and we worked it out.' That's maybe what I thought we'd be able to do last year with the guys. But that's, we found out that didn't work the best for us. This year we worked all summer to try to figure these things out."
The Knicks launch their preseason at Madison Square Garden on Wednesday, with the Brooklyn Nets traveling to New York for the first warm-up game of the campaign.
They then face the Wizards twice, Nets again, Rockets, and Thunder before starting the regular season in Oklahoma where Anthony will face his old team in his first competitive start for the Thunder. The defense, by then, may not be as easy to beat as he remembers.

Fortunately for Dwight Howard there is still 15 days and five warm-up games remaining for Charlotte until the regular season resumes.
On October 19, the Hornets travel to the Little Caesars Arena in Detroit to take on the Pistons and, by then, the team will hope that Howard will have spent much of his time on the court—at the free-throw line.
Howard is becoming increasingly notorious for his inaccuracy from the line, so on Monday night there was anticipation when the Hornets were awarded a free-throw in the first quarter against the Celtics, with the scores at 17-12 to Boston.
Howard, a 13-year  NBA veteran, stepped up, stretched his arms out and sent his effort looping to the left of the net, hitting nothing but air.
A stunned silence filled the arena and the NBC commentator simply said: “Wow.”

Take a look:

This is not the first time Howard has made an airball from the charity stripe, and has record of just 56.6 percent as a shooter.
Hornets went on to lose the game 94-82, and although Howard’s miss made little difference in the scheme of things, Steve Clifford will want him perfecting his shot over the next two weeks or his duties may have to be passed on.
Kyrie Irving, meanwhile, making his first game for Boston, may have had a little sympathy for Howard: “You know what it felt like, it was just so wide out there," said Irving, quoted by  ESPN.
"I don't know if you even understand what I'm saying, like when we start off the game, like my eyes were just wide. And the basket was a little bit smaller and things were just a lot bigger than what they are. And that's just literally not playing basketball on an NBA floor for a few months.”
Not playing basketball in a few months won’t be an excuse for Howard if he’s hitting airballs by the end of October, though.

A former Marine kicked two Texas students off a school football team, telling them to remove their jerseys and leave the field, after they protested the national anthem before a game.
The two Victory & Praise Christian Academy football players and cousins, Cedric Ingram-Lewis and Larry McCullough, protested the anthem by raising a fist and kneeling Friday night in solidarity with former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick who kneeled because he could not stand for “a country that oppresses black people and people of color,” he once told reporters.  

Kaepernick’s kneel has spurred copycats and sparked a nationwide debate that led President Donald Trump to throw his two cents into the ring when he called anyone who refused to stand a “son of a b***.”
The debate is now playing out in classrooms and high school football fields like the Crosby field where Ingram-Lewis and McCullough played. The school coach, Ronnie Mitchem, told the Houston Chronicle that he had a deal with his students that no one would kneel during the anthem. Mitchem, a veteran and pastor, said kneeling is offensive to veterans.
"Like I said, I'm a former Marine,” he told the Chronicle. "That just doesn't fly and they knew that. I don't have any problem with those young men. They chose to do that and they had to pay for the consequences."
Mitchem would have preferred for his students to kneel after a touchdown or hand out papers about the issues.
The students went against their coach’s wishes Friday night and the coach told them to leave their uniforms on the field.
"He told us that disrespect will not be tolerated," Ingram-Lewis, a sophomore, told the Chronicle.
Before the game, one of the teens had posted about kneeling on social media. The team has previously discussed the subject of kneeling in the locker room.
Ingram-Lewis’s mother told ABC13 that the coach can't keep students from exercising their right to protest. 
"He has a slave master mentality," she said. "If you were to go back to that when they wanted to tell us this is what you are going to do and this is how you do it. And if we didn't comply, we were beaten, whooped or even killed."
Courts have long upheld that students have the right to abstain from standing for the national anthem or saying the Pledge of Allegiance.
“In terms of student rights, there seems little to discuss,” JoAnn Bartoletti, executive director of the National Association of Secondary School Principals, said in a statement.  “Courts have affirmed and reaffirmed that students do not check their First Amendment rights at the schoolhouse gate, and speech cannot be curtailed unless it creates a material disruption to the educational process.”


Though the Kansas City Chiefs would go on to win the game, they were dealt a crushing blow in their season-opening game against the defending Super Bowl champion New England Patriots. Eric Berry, the team's best defensive player, tore an achilles while covering Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski and his season was over. The Chiefs have certainly missed his presence in the defensive backfield, but not as much as one might think. Entering Monday night's game against the Redskins, they're the only remaining undefeated team in the NFL.
Related: 'Monday Night Football' injury news for fantasy owners
The secret to the Chiefs's success has been breakout rookie running back Kareem Hunt, who has rushed for a league-leading 401 yards in three games, and the near-flawless play of quarterback Alex Smith, who had been known mostly as a game manager rather than someone who could light up a box score. Throw in a top-of-the-line defense (even without Berry) and a dominating home-field advantage, and you have what may be the best team in the league, a quarter of the way through the season—that is, if they can take care of business against the Redskins Monday night.
Before the season began, experts didn't think much of the Redskins. They'd be average, maybe, which is about how good they looked after a Week 1 loss to the Eagles and a Week 2 victory over the Rams. Things changed last week, though, when they demolished the undefeated Oakland Raiders, holding the AFC West frontrunner's high-powered offense to a measley 128 yards. Speaking of their defensive might, the Redskins have allowed only 816 yards through three games. In fact, the Redskins so far have allowed only 15 more rushing yards (187) than Kareem Hunt tallied last week against the Chargers alone (172). In other words, something's gotta give.
Both teams are in extremely competitive divisions, so every game is crucial. If the Chiefs win, they will be a game ahead of the 3-1 Broncos in the AFC West, and two games above the 2-2 Raiders. The 2-1 Redskins will need to win to keep pace with the 3-1 Eagles atop the NFC East. If they lose, they'll fall into a tie for second place with the 2-2 Cowboys. Fortunately for the Chiefs, Broncos and Raiders, the 0-4 Chargers don't look like they're going to challenge for a playoff spot. Same goes for the 0-4 Giants in the NFC East. Outside of the cellar dwellers, though, both of these divisions are up for grabs.
So, yeah, it's looking like a good game, but how do you watch it? As always, this week's edition of Monday Night Football will be broadcast on ESPN and live-streamed on the WatchESPN app. Kickoff is at 8:30 p.m. ET, and Sean McDonough, Jon Gruden and Lisa Salters will call the action.


In an NFL season where it seems that anyone really can beat anyone (OK, not the Browns), the Kansas City Chiefs stand alone in front of the pack.
The Atlanta Falcons’ loss to the Buffalo Bills at Mercedes-Benz Stadium on Sunday left Andy Reid’s Chiefs as the only unbeaten team left in the league, at 3-0. With the New England Patriots—whom the Chiefs beat in Foxborough the opening night of the 2017 season (September 8)—struggling at 2-2, the Chiefs have possibly the best chance they will ever get under Reid to take the top seed in the AFC and secure home advantage through the playoffs. Perhaps the Pittsburgh Steelers, who knocked the Chiefs out of the divisional round last season during an ice storm at Arrowhead, now offer the stiffest opposition in the AFC.
Once derided in the mold of their quarterback Alex Smith as good but too safe to actually win a Super Bowl, the Chiefs have benefited from several good drafts. In his second year in the league, Tyreek Hill remains probably the NFL’s most dynamic receiver-runner-returner hybrid. Travis Kelce is one of the league’s best tight ends, while the Redskins may have to stack the box to deal with the threat of rookie sensation Kareem Hunt. Hunt is averaging 8.5 yards per carry, numbers that demand respect and could open up room in the passing game for Smith, Kelce and Hill.
The Chiefs will definitely be without outside linebacker and premier pass-rusher Dee Ford and center Mich Morse. Ford and offensive tackle Eric Fisher both have back injuries, according to the  Kansas City Star, though Fisher could play on Monday.
The Redskins, currently at 2-1, can take advantage of the NFC East's logjam after the Cowboys lost at home to the Los Angeles Chargers on Sunday. The Giants are already out of contention, at 0-4, but the Redskins need a win to keep pace with the Philadelphia Eagles. The NFC East looks almost as tricky to work out as the NFC North—such is the lack of a dominant, consistent team.
The Redskins have concerns on offense before Monday night’s game at Arrowhead. The latest injury report lists wide receiver Jamison Crowder as questionable with a hamstring problem. Tight end Jordan Reed was limited in practice on Saturday with what the Redskins  describe as a “rib/sternum” injury. Rob Kelley has a rib injury and is also questionable, but Jay Gruden can lean on Chris Thompson to provide the Redskins’ running game. Thompson is averaging 8.5 yards per carry after three games.


A season of baseball—spring training, epic road trips, homestands, injuries, tears, smiles, 400-foot homers and too many pop-ups to count or remember, of 162 games—comes down to one night in the Bronx between the New York Yankees and the Minnesota Twins.
The Yankees, the “Baby Bombers,” are probably ahead of schedule in reaching the playoffs this year. Few expected Aaron Judge or Gary Sanchez to be quite this good this soon in their careers. Judge has powered the offense in his first full season and led the American League with 52 home runs—and strikeouts. Sanchez hammered 33, helping the Yankees heat up again at the end of the season following a sticky patch in the early summer. Joe Girardi got another baby back in Greg Bird for the closing stretch of the regular season, while General Manager Brian Cashman added depth to the pitching before the trade deadline as it became clear that Girardi’s team was in the playoff race. David Robertson, acquired in midseason from the Chicago White Sox, has a 1.03 ERA through 30 games; Tommy Kahnle, another player added by Cashman this year, has also impressed.
Girardi has already confirmed that his ace, Luis Severino, will be starting on Tuesday at Yankee Stadium. But with the American League Division Series against the Cleveland Indians starting at Progressive Park on October 5, how deep Severino pitches into the game is a matter of conjecture.  ESPN 1500 noted last week that the depth of the Yankees bullpen means Girardi could potentially pull Severino after three innings and rely on his relievers the rest of the way, to save his starting pitcher for the Indians.
All that presupposes, of course, that the Yankees jump out to a lead early. The Twins, who finished the regular season with 85 wins and a stroll of a victory against the Detroit Tigers on Sunday, have the more experienced starting pitcher in Ervin Santana. And while they have an infamously terrible record against the Yankees over the past 15 seasons, the Twins have young slugging power of their own in Miguel Sano. It was a veteran who led the team in home runs, though, as 30-year-old Brian Dozier hit 34. Dozier also led the Twins in RBIs with 93.
You can watch the Yankees and Twins from 8 p.m. E.S.T. via  ESPN and ESPN Deportes. Those streaming the game can use the  Watch ESPN service.


The NFL in 2017 is really, really odd.
Not in a stylish, avant-garde, fashionable kind of way, though: The league this year is wild, messy, scruffy and unkempt. There’s a lot of very poor football and a glut of very average teams. And that is making it tremendous fun to watch.
Take Week 4, for example. The Los Angeles Rams at best were expected to show flashes of promise this season under rookie head coach Sean McVay, but they went into AT&T Stadium on Sunday, withstood a first-half onslaught from Dak Prescott and the Cowboys, and then munched the clock—and the Dallas defense—led by Todd Gurley and the surprisingly effective Jared Goff. The Rams are now 3-1, a game ahead of the Seattle Seahawks in the NFC West.
So far, so odd, and the strangeness kept coming. The Buffalo Bills somehow pulled out a road win in Atlanta to end the Falcons’ undefeated streak. The Bills got just enough offense from Tyrod Taylor and a huge defensive effort to shut down Matt Ryan. They too sit at a surprising 3-1, and lead the AFC East by a game.
Oh, and the Patriots lost for the second time this season—in Foxborough. Cam Newton and the Carolina Panthers jump-started a hitherto sluggish offense, exploiting what is now the NFL’s worst defense through four weeks. Bill Belichick’s team conceded 42 points on Week 1 to the Kansas City Chiefs, 20 points to the Saints, 33 to the Texans and now 33 to the Panthers.  NFL.com, in a fairly brutal takedown, pointed to a chronic lack of pass-rush and confusion in the secondary. Arguably as important, the same article noted, is the pressure the failing defense and lack of receiving threats is putting on Tom Brady. His brilliance got the Patriots out of trouble against the Texans last week, but he cannot be asked to pull off fourth-quarter miracles every game. Brady was hit seven times and sacked three more, which is going to happen when you have no rushing attack to speak of. Brady is 40, and the Patriots can’t afford to have him hit this much.
All of this early-season oddness has given a psychedelic look to the AFC East standings. There are the Bills at the top, followed by the New York Jets and then the Patriots. Weirdness of weirdness, the Jets haven’t been the 1-15 team even sage people were predicting. At least the Browns look set to be as bad as, if not a bit worse than, everyone thought.
It might not be fun to watch, exactly—the Jaguars-Jets overtime game was best viewed through fingers and with frequent breaks for fresh air. But it has been fun so far, and that’s not something you can always say about the NFL.


In hindsight, the first-ever NFL game at Wembley may have been a warning of things to come.
On October 28, 2007, rain fell in great sheets over Wembley Stadium. Eli Manning and Cleo Lemon—a pub-quiz answer if ever there were one—combined for 168 total passing yards as the New York Giants beat the Miami Dolphins 13-10.
It was ugly. And while London’s enthusiasm for the NFL hasn’t waned over the subsequent decade, the games the U.K.’s capital has hosted—or been subjected to—have not increased in prettiness.
Sunday’s fixture between the New Orleans Saints and the Dolphins at Wembley fit the pattern. The Dolphins mustered zero points, Jay Cutler threw a red-zone interception and got sacked, lots. Jay Ajayi, the London-born running back, was forgotten after a promising first half as the Dolphins fell further and further behind. The Saints defense, with all its holes and rookies in the secondary, looked like the 1985 Chicago Bears. The great Drew Brees only had to be adequate.
“New Orleans Saints beat Miami Dolphins in Wembley stinker” was British newspaper  The Guardian’s headline on Sunday evening in a report of the game, describing it as “error-riddled” and “penalty-strewn.” “There rightly remains a healthy degree of scepticism about whether a full-time London NFL team is viable,” Sean Ingle wrote, before continuing pithily: “But perhaps this was another small step forward in realizing the ambitions of the sport’s power brokers. If people tolerate this, perhaps a franchise will be next.”
It isn’t entirely fair to say that the International Series has never seen a good game. In October 2014 Matthew Stafford did a Matthew Stafford and dug the Detroit Lions out of a hole against the Atlanta Falcons, the game eventually finishing 22-21 to the Lions after a fierce comeback. The Redskins-Bengals tie last year was exciting, and amusing for the result alone (it ended 27-27 to the delight of London fans.) The novelty factor has provided more and better memories, though, than the games themselves.
The NFL is in something of a bind, of course. The teams that really want to come over—with the aim of eventually establishing a London-based franchise—would like to relocate because they are struggling in the U.S., as in the case of the Jacksonville Jaguars. And they are struggling, at least in part, because they are not very good. The NFL used to send over matchups like the Steelers against the Vikings or the Broncos against the 49ers. But where is the logic in reducing your television audience for big-market teams when you could be promoting a luckless, unhappy franchise to a new audience?
There’s a serious question here for the NFL. While the London games continue to sell out on the experience of going to an NFL fixture, the league need not worry. But will London put up with games like the Saints’ win over the Dolphins every week? While Mexico only gets one game this year, that game is the Patriots against the Raiders. Twickenham, the home of English rugby, has the delights of the Cardinals against the Rams and Vikings against the Browns to come. The choice of teams isn’t the only factor to consider, of course. There’s also the travel element, and in the Dolphins’ case this year the stress caused by Hurricane Irma. London has been a boon for the NFL and will likely be for many years to come. But it won’t put up with the novelty of terrible football forever.


With three weeks remaining until the start of the new NBA season, there is just one question on the lips of Knicks fans: Is there a plan in place to cope without Carmelo Anthony?
But, according to point guard Ramon Sessions, the Knicks have a player in their ranks who has the qualities and potential to succeed  Anthony, who traded to  Oklahoma Thunder. Knicks got Enes Kanter and Doug McDermott for Anthony, plus a second-round pick in the 2018 draft, but Sessions’s praise was for a youngster in the ranks.
The veteran has been assigned to work as a mentor with Frank Ntilikina, a 19-year-old point guard from Belgium, and he believes the Knicks could have a superstar of the future, comparing him to  Kyrie Irving.
"I played with Kyrie when he was young. He’s got a lot of Kyrie tendencies," Sessions said. "Not the most athletic guy but can handle the ball in tight spots. It’s still early on, but he definitely gives me that Kyrie feel when Kyrie was a rookie."
When told about Sessions's comments, Ntilikina was flattered by the praise. “Kyrie is Kyrie,’’ Ntilikina told the New York Post. “That’s something. He’s an All-Star, has done crazy things. Hearing that is a blessing. Ramon is here for me. Giving me a lot of advice. I’m learning a lot from him.”

Head coach Jeff Hornacek has also been impressed by the work of the young Belgian, and says he is gradually becoming more and more confident, and imposing himself on the group.
“I think he’s playing with more confidence every day,’’ Hornacek said. “In the beginning, he was probably more tentative which is understandable—19-year-old kid coming across and playing with these guys that he’s probably seen on TV and now he’s in the middle of it. But now he’s just one of the guys out there playing and he looks good.’’
Irving, meanwhile, is preparing for the start of a new season but with a different team. After the sensational trade of the summer to the Boston Celtics, with Isaiah Thomas going the other way, Irving will begin the campaign by playing his former team, the Cleveland Cavaliers on October 18.


A week after the Rams and 49ers shocked Thursday night viewers by combining for 80 points, Week 4 brings a Thursday Night Football matchup that is actually pretty good on paper...which of course means the game is likely to be boring.

The Packers needed overtime to beat the lowly Bengals in Week 3, but Aaron Rodgers and company have been one of the most exciting teams this season, and at 2-1 are tied with the Lions and Vikings atop the NFC Central. A game behind them at 1-2 are the Bears, a team many predicted would be one of the worst in the league. This hasn't been the case. Though the Buccaneers blew them out in Week 2, they nearly beat the Falcons, who appear to be the class of the NFC, in the season opener, and last week they took down the Steelers in overtime.
A good game on paper, indeed. So, how do you watch? The game will be broadcast on CBS and the NFL Network at 8:25 p.m. ET. Jim Nantz and Tony Romo will be in the booth. It will be available to stream on Amazon Prime Video, which this season will host 10 Thursday Night Football games and a Christmas Day game. Check out their commercial for the showdown between the Bears and Packers.

Not bad.
Following last week's to-kneel-or-not-to-kneel controversy, it will be interesting to see to what extent player protests continue into Week 4. Thursday night will be our first indication, and the Packers have made it clear that they are not going to let up. On Tuesday, players including Aaron Rodgers urged fans at Lambeau Field to lock arms during the national anthem, as many players, coaches and even owners did last Sunday.
“This is about equality,” Rodgers said Tuesday, according to ESPN's Rob Demovsky. “This is about unity and love and growing together as a society and starting a conversation around something that may be a little bit uncomfortable for people.
“But we’ve got to come together and talk about these things and grow as a community, as a connected group of individuals in our society, and we’re going to continue to show love and unity, and this week we’re going to ask the fans to join in as well and come together and show people that we can be connected and we can grow together.”
The show of solidarity will be a turnoff for many, including country music legend Charlie Daniels, who on Wednesday night tried and failed to boycott Thursday Night Football.

We'll be watching for more from Charlie's Twitter feed tonight.


We are yet to even gain a halfway decent inkling as to how Lonzo Ball will do as a point guard in the NBA—and no, summer league basketball doesn’t count, as impressive as he was at times.
Still, the hype surrounding Ball and the constant buzz around the Los Angeles Lakers means the rookie is being made a part of Dream Teams before he has even started a regular-season game. The latest report comes from  Metro.us, and it should get Lakers fans very excited indeed while remembering that there is almost no chance this actually happens as perfectly as described.
Russell Westbook,  Metro  notes, is approaching the October 16 deadline for signing a “supermax” contract extension with the Oklahoma City Thunder. The 2016-17 regular-season M.V.P. is out of contract with the Thunder in the summer of 2019 but he can test free agency next summer.
As can LeBron James.
Now, the Thunder have bent over backwards to keep Westbrook. They signed Paul George on a rental this past summer and just added Carmelo Anthony at the power-forward position. They look like a contender again in the Western Conference, at least for a season.
But that still may not be enough to keep Westbrook, especially if the rumors and reports turn into reality and James decides to spend the final portion of his career in a city where he has business interests.
In that case, there is a possibility that the Thunder are just incubating the Westbrook-George partnership in a laboratory before both hop across to a bigger, if far more recently dysfunctional, franchise.
While the Lakers have Ball on a rookie contract, they can probably just about find a way to fit three more superstars around the salary cap. It sounds extraordinary to be talking in these terms when Ball could still be a bust, but this may be too tempting a proposition for Magic Johnson to ignore.


The eyes of the nation and the rest of the world may be on the NFL again this weekend to see how players act before kick-off, but there are still games to play.
After the  national anthem is played and the teams are out and on the field,  President Donald Trump will be forgotten. Games are there to be won.

Once upon a time—even as recently as a year ago—the Chicago Bears visiting the Green Bay Packers would have existed in a bubble as a battle for supremacy in the NFC North (yes, let’s enter a parallel reality for the moment where the Bears are contenders).
In 2017, though, the NFL can no longer stay divorced from the political climate of the country. Colin Kaepernick awoke a protest movement by kneeling during the national anthem last September, transmitting a message about the treatment of black and minority Americans by the police. But it took President Donald Trump’s extraordinary intervention last Friday to light another fire under U.S. professional sport. Trump’s statement to a rally in Alabama that NFL owners should “fire” any player kneeling during the anthem provoked a show of unity across the league at the weekend from players and owners. In London, England, the Baltimore Ravens and Jacksonville Jaguars knelt for the Star Spangled Banner and stood during the rendition of God Save the Queen. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell called Trump’s words “divisive.”
On Monday night, the Dallas Cowboys knelt briefly before the national anthem, accompanied by owner Jerry Jones, before defeating the Arizona Cardinals at University of Phoenix Stadium in Glendale. Jones, who  donated $1 million to Trump’s inauguration, had previously voiced his belief in “respect for the flag.”
And so to Thursday Night Football, and a game that might once have revolved around whether Mitch Trubisky should replace Mike Glennon, or whether Aaron Rodgers can shed some unusually inconsistent early-season form. The Packers released a  statement on Tuesday evening calling on their fans to join in their own gesture at Lambeau Field, by linking arms as the players and coaches intend to do.
“Let’s work together to build a society that is more fair and just,” the statement read. “Join us this Thursday by locking arms with whoever you’re with, stranger or loved one, wherever you are—intertwined and included—in this moment of unification.”
On Sunday before the overtime win over the Cincinnati Bengals, only Martellus Bennett, Lance Kendricks and Kevin King sat on the bench at Lambeau for the anthem while the rest of the team linked arms on the sideline. Bennett is the brother of Michael, the Seattle Seahawks defensive end who has been one of the most prominent faces and voices in the debate.
The Packers’ behavior is an illustration of how Kaepernick’s original message has become diversified—Kendricks told  ESPN that he sat in order to bring awareness to the plight of Puerto Ricans affected by Hurricane Maria. Rodgers, meanwhile, said the Packers’ gesture was about “unity” not protest. "This is about equality," Rodgers  said. "This is about unity and love and growing together as a society and starting a conversation around something that may be a little bit uncomfortable for people. But we've got to come together and talk about these things and grow as a community, as a connected group of individuals in our society, and we're going to continue to show love and unity, and this week we're going to ask the fans to join in as well and come together and show people that we can be connected and we can grow together."
The Bears were involved, indirectly, in one of the most visually arresting moments of last weekend when the entire visiting Pittsburgh Steelers team except left tackle Alejandro Villanueva declined to come out of the locker room for the anthem. The Bears linked arms while the Star-Spangled Banner played.
CBS  will air the anthem before tonight’s game, according to the  Chicago Tribune—the first "Thursday Night Football" game since Trump blundered into the debate and set the NFL, social justice and politics rushing head-on to meet each other. In a superheated political climate, the actual game is an afterthought.


There was a sense of deja-vu on Champions League Matchday Two, at least for the English clubs involved in the competition.
While Manchester United and City strolled to victories, and Tottenham Hotspur and Chelsea won away impressively, Liverpool again dominated but failed to put away limited opposition. Celtic, meanwhile, registered its most impressive European victory in several seasons. Here’s how they, and the Premier league teams, rated.
Even without the injured Paul Pogba (and Marouane Fellaini, who remains important to Jose Mourinho), United ran a steamroller over CSKA Moscow. What should have been a difficult away trip became, thanks to Romelu Lukaku and some horrendous defending from the home side, a stroll to the top of Group A. Basel hammering Benfica in Switzerland means everyone else is now pretty much fighting for second in the group behind United.
Grade: A
Woah, that was impressive. Chelsea marched into the Wanda Metropolitano, not as intimidating yet as the old Vicente Calderon in terms of atmosphere but still a tremendously difficult place to visit, and fully deserved a victory given to them by a last-minute goal from Michy Batshuayi. Antonio Conte’s team created multiple chances against Atletico’s suffocating defense and midfield, while limiting the Spanish side’s best attacking player in Antoine Griezmann to half-chances. If Chelsea takes four points from the double-header against Roma, it should win what looked like a tricky Group C.
Grade: A+
It wasn’t always easy for Spurs in Cyprus but in Harry Kane Mauricio Pochettino has a genuine world-class striker. Kane’s hat-trick means Tottenham is level at the top of Group H with two delicious matchups against Real Madrid and their former player Gareth Bale to come. Borussia Dortmund’s surprising ineptitude means Madrid and Spurs should be fighting it out to win the group.
Grade: A
Once Kevin De Bruyne had opened the scoring with a delicious long-range strike, City had little problem in easing past their Ukrainian opponents. Napoli’s surprising opening-day defeat to Shakhtar means City’s path to winning Group F is simpler than it might have been.
Grade: A
It’s no good creating two games’ worth of goalscoring chances if you can’t put them away. Call it profligacy or bad luck, but games like Tuesday night’s are becoming a recurring theme for Jurgen Klopp in the Premier League and in Europe. Liverpool should still qualify from a weak Group F, along with Sevilla. But what should have been easy progress to the knockout rounds now looks like a struggle.
Grade: B-
Anyone can be beaten handily by Paris Saint-Germain, as Bayern Munich showed on Wednesday night. With a vibrant performance and 3-0 victory in Belgium, Brendan Rodgers’ team put themselves forward as serious challengers to Bayern to claim the runner’s-up spot in Group B. At the very least, Celtic should now progress to the Europa League.
Grade: A


Steph Curry has ripped into the latest Sports Illustrated cover on the unity of sport for not including NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick, according to reports.
Released earlier this week,the magazine features an image of Curry, star of the Golden State Warriors team, arm in arm with LeBron James and Roger Goodell. Warriors coach Steve Kerr also features, along with football players such as Michael Bennett.
All 10 people on the new cover have spoken out against  President Trump in the last week after he urged  NFL owners to fire any players who kneeled down during the anthem. But Curry said there was one crucial absentee: Colin Kaepernick, the former San Francisco 49ers quarterback who started the idea of taking a knee.
“That was terrible,” Curry said,  according to the  San Francisco Chronicle. “It’s just kind capitalizing on the hoopla and the media and all that nonsense. The real people understand exactly what’s been going on, and who’s really been active and vocal and truly making a difference.
Related:   NBA is Trump’s next big problem, and it’ll be worse than the NFL
“If you don’t have Kaepernick front and center on that, something’s wrong. It’s kind of hard how certain narratives take place, being prisoners of the moment.”

Curry also criticized the idea to have him pictured linking arms with Goodell, as he “had the most on-the-fence comment.” Curry was not the only one to notice the absence of Kapernick.

“I looked at it and went, ‘Where the hell is Kap?'” Kerr said,  according to  The Athletic. “If the article is about activism in sports, how is Kaepernick not on the cover? I just don’t understand how you can omit the guy who basically began this movement.”
The backlash from the sports world came after Trump hit out at the NFL for kneeling, saying it was “disrespectful to our country and our flag.” Curry, a member of the Warriors Championship winning team this year, was quick to make clear he would not be attending the visit to the White House, a tradition for the NBA champions.

“By acting and not going, hopefully that will inspire some change when it comes to what we tolerate in this country and what is accepted and what we turn a blind eye to,” Curry said, as quoted by  The Washington Post.
Though a rival on the court, James, of the Cleveland Cavaliers, backed Curry both on social media, calling Trump a “bum”, and to reporters on Monday. “Going to [the] White House was a great honor until you showed up!” James  wrote on Twitter.


Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho has sent scouts to watch Roma midfielder Radja Nainggolan and is considering fighting Chelsea to sign him, according to reports.
The Belgian midfielder was the subject of interest for  Chelsea throughout the summer, but the move never materialized and Antonio Conte ended up signing Tiemoue Bakayoko.
Nainggolan remains on the club’s radar for when the transfer window reopens, but the 29-year-old is also now a target for  United and Mourinho, according to  The Sun.
The Manchester United manager, the report says, sent his scouts to go and watch Nainggolan during Roma’s  Champions League tie with Atletico Madrid earlier this month.
But they also had an eye on two players in the red and white of Madrid, with Mourinho a long-term admirer of both  Antoine Griezmann and Saul Niguez.

Griezmann has a buy-out clause of £88 million (about $117 million) and reports suggest United will activate it next summer, while midfielder Niguez is also expected to cost around £85 million.
Both players featured in the Champions League last night, in a 2-1 defeat to Conte’s Chelsea at the Wanda Metropolitano, the first time Atletico has been beaten at home by English opposition.
Griezmann opened the scoring from the penalty spot before Alvaro Morata, Chelsea's shiny new striker from Real Madrid, equalized and Michy Batshuayi came off the bench to grab the winner in injury time.

Mourinho would not have been watching the game, however, as his United team was in Russia in its own group stage tie against CSKA Moscow.
Romelu Lukaku grabbed two, Anthony Martial scored from the spot, and Henrikh Mkhitaryan put United four ahead before the hour mark. United and Chelsea both put in performances into impress Nainggolan.


The director of the Michigan State Police has apologized for calling NFL players who kneel in protest of police brutality "anti-American degenerates"—but critics are still calling for her resignation, citing the agency's long history of racial discrimination.
Col. Kriste Kibbey Etue posted the controversial meme on her personal Facebook account, which appears to have been deleted, saying athletes who are kneeling during the national anthem in protest are "millionaire ingrates who hate America and disrespect our armed forces and veterans."
"We stand with the Heroes, not a bunch of rich, entitled, arrogant, ungrateful, anti-American degenerates," she posted. 
Etue later apologized, calling the post "a mistake," but critics called for her resignation from a department already facing criticism after an officer killed a black teen under questionable circumstances in August. 
"Etue's words simply reflect the continued racist actions of the Michigan State Police, both in how they treat our citizens and in how their hiring demographics fail to even approach equity," Kenneth Reed, a spokesman for the Detroit Coalition Against Police Brutality, told the Detroit Free Press. 
The department has been sued by troopers 52 times since 1993, with the majority of the suits filed by black officers charging racial discrimination, the Detroit Free Press reported.
Meanwhile, President Donald Trump continued his tirade against the NFL on Twitter on Wednesday, starting his morning with a post claiming that the Dallas Cowboys, who all kneeled at their game on Monday night, will in future "stand for Country." 
The NFL protest, started by Colin Kaepernick after a number of high-profile police shootings of black men, gained more attention last week after a fiery speech by Trump where he called on the NFL to fire athletes who take a knee during the anthem. 
“Wouldn’t you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say, ‘Get that son of a bitch off the field right now. Out! He’s fired. He’s fired!'" Trump said. 


Chelsea is favorite to sign Paris Saint-Germain striker Edinson Cavani after the striker’s public fallout with teammates earlier this month, according to reports.
Cavani, the Uruguayan forward, reportedly fell out with teammates in the French capital following a dispute with the team’s new £198 million (about $265 million) signing Neymar.
French newspaper  L’Equipe  claimed Neymar and Cavani had to be kept apart following a 2-0 French league win over Lyon earlier this month in which Neymar took a penalty over Cavani.
It is increasingly expected that Cavani will be on his way out, with far too much invested in Neymar to go against the Brazilian. And, according to  The Sun, it is Premier League club Chelsea that leads the race for him.
Cavani, the report says, rejected an offer of £880,000 from the club to step aside and allow Neymar to take over penalty duties; he refused.

PSG is also under pressure to sell players after spending such a massive amount of money this summer, breaking the transfer world record to take Neymar from Barcelona plus the addition of Kylian Mbappe.
Mbappe, the French teenager, is currently on loan with Unai Emery’s team but an agreement is in place to make the move permanent, which will cost PSG up to £163 million.
The idea of Cavani joining Antonio Conte’s team in west London is an ominous prospect for the rest of the Premier League. Cavani has scored 56 goals in his last 57 games for PSG, and with Alvaro Morata easing into life at Chelsea, scoring six in his first six games for the club, Conte would have a lethal strike force at his disposal.
For now, Morata remains the new main man at Chelsea. But on Wednesday night he and the rest of the squad will come face-to-face with his predecessor. Chelsea takes on Atletico Madrid at the Wanda Metropolitano in the group stage of the Champions League, with Costa expected to be in attendance.


The Golden State Warriors may still, it seems, celebrate their NBA championship in Washington with politicians—just not President Donald Trump.
In a week in which  Trump’s relationship with sports has nosedived, the Democrats have tried to take advantage by inviting Steve Kerr and the Warriors to D.C. for a visit. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi posted an image to Twitter of a letter she had sent to Kerr and his team, tagging  Stephen Curry and the Warriors. “The offer still stands,”  she wrote.
The letter, from June, invites Golden State to celebrate the championship at the United States Capitol. “We look forward to honoring your championship in the heart of our democracy,” Pelosi wrote.
.@StephenCurry30 &amp; @warriors – the offer still stands. #DubNation pic.twitter.com/qfi2DEsKLk

It comes just days after Curry publicly said he wouldn’t be attending the White House to visit  Trump, who then withdrew the offer.
“You can talk about all the different personalities that have said things and done things—from Kaepernick to what happened with Michael Bennett to all sorts of examples of what has gone on in our country that has led to change,”  Curry said. “We’re all trying to do what we can using our platforms, using our opportunities to shed light on that. That’s kind of where I stand on that. I don’t think us not going to the White House will miraculously make everything better, but this is my opportunity to voice that.”

The president tweeted the following day to say that the invitation was withdrawn. He wrote: “Going to the White House is considered a great honor for a championship team. Stephen Curry is hesitating, therefore invitation is withdrawn!”
Championship teams visiting the president at the White House has become something of a tradition, but Kerr says that has become increasingly tricky to continue. “The president made it really, really difficult for us to honor that institution,” he told The New York Times.
Trump’s warring with the NBA wasn’t even the main subject of conversation in sports this week following the president’s message to NFL owners that they should fire players who take a knee during the national anthem.
“Wouldn't you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say, 'Get that son of a bitch off the field right now! Out! He's fired. He's fired'?” Trump said at an Alabama rally Friday.
But there was no firing, just backfiring for Trump. And the image of the Curry, Kerr and the Warriors celebrating with the Democrats will not please him any more.


John Kasich has the answers to more than just Ohio’s politics. The state governor says he even knows how the Oklahoma City Thunder can win the NBA Championship: playing with two balls.
Kasich, governor of Ohio since 2010 and a fervent basketball fan, followed the summer’s trades and signings with intrigue, especially  Carmelo Anthony’s move from New York Knicks to the Thunder.
Asked by  TMZ in the streets of New York what he thought about the trade on Monday, Kasich gave his advice to  Anthony’s new coach Billy Donovan.
“I don’t know,” Kasich said. “They’re gonna need two basketballs when Oklahoma City plays, one for him and one for his teammates.”
Seems Kasich believes the addition of the 33-year-old forward is not going to transform  the Thunder into Championship contenders overnight, even with Russell Westbrook and Paul George in the team.

Like many Cavs fans, it took a while for Kasich to decide what he made of the departure of Kyrie Irving to Boston, with Isaiah Thomas arriving in Cleveland in the trade of the summer.
“At first, I didn’t know what to think,” Kasich added, “because Kyrie is so great, but now, as people say, Thomas is healthy.
“A couple of the other pics they got, the guy plays good defense. So on balance it's a draw or maybe slightly Cleveland but I'm not sure.”
The  big debate that has gripped the nation as well as the sports world over the past week and beyond is players taking knees in the NFL. On Friday, President Trump urged the heads of football teams to fire any player who chose to kneel during the national anthem.
“Wouldn't you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say, 'Get that son of a bitch off the field right now, out, he's fired. He's fired',” Trump said at an Alabama rally Friday. But the reaction was not what he’d hoped for.
Prior to the  NFL games Sunday, many players protested—some took a knee, others linked arms and some remained in the locker room—during the national anthem.
Asked what he made of the debate, Kasich simply said that “everybody has a right to protest in America.”


No-one, it seems, is safe from being dragged into the national anthem debate, not even Jamaican sprinters. On Tuesday night, President Trump chose eight-time Olympic gold medalist Usain Bolt to put on a pedestal for respecting the anthem.
Trump posted a video of Bolt from the 2012 Games in London, during an interview with a television crew. Bolt asks the interviewer to pause as the American national anthem sounded over the loudspeaker in the stadium.
Five years on,  Trump uploaded the footage to his Twitter account and wrote: “Even Usain Bolt from Jamaica, one of the greatest runners and athletes of all time, showed RESPECT for our National Anthem!”

Trump's latest tweet on the matter comes six days after he urged the heads of football teams to fire any player who chose to kneel during the national anthem.

Former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick was the first to kneel during the anthem during preseason last year, protesting about the social inequality and treatment of blacks across the country.

Prior to the  NFL games Sunday, many players protested—some took a knee, others linked arms and some remained in the locker room—during the national anthem. Players came out after the games and commented on the act and defying  the president’s words, including Patriots’ quarterback  Tom Brady.
“Yeah, I certainly disagree with what [Trump] said. I thought it was just divisive,” the 40-year-old said on WEEI’s  Kirk & Callahan. Like I said, I just want to support my teammates. I am never one to say, 'Oh, that is wrong, that is right.' I do believe in what I believe in. I believe in bringing people together, and respect and love and trust. Those are the values that my parents instilled in me.”
Trump is refusing to back down from the debate, however, and on Tuesday urged football to create a ban on kneeling. “The NFL has all sorts of rules and regulations,” he tweeted. “The only way out for them is to set a rule that you can’t kneel during our National Anthem!”
Bolt is yet to comment on the post, but the debate over the national anthem seems far from over—especially if Trump has anything to do about it.


Jurgen Klopp’s Liverpool is in the Russian capital tonight to take on Spartak Moscow in the second game of Group E in the Champions League.
Klopp’s team drew with Sevilla in the opening match of  the competition and has now made the 2,000-mile journey to Moscow.
The game kicks off at 2:45 p.m. Eastern Time and will be shown on Fox Sports 2 on television. It will also be live-streamed on fuboTV which you can find  here. For U.K. viewers, coverage begins on BT Sport 2 at 6:45 p.m. BST with kick-off an hour later.
One of the main issues for  Klopp ahead of the game has been how to fit all his attacking players into his team, with Philippe Coutinho available once again.
The Brazilian midfielder, who was reportedly the subject of a £140 million offer (about $188 million) from Barcelona last month, returned to action for  Liverpool’s 1-1 draw with Burnley 10 days ago. He fitted in, conveniently, for Sadio Mane, who was suspended after being dismissed for a high boot in the 5-0 defeat to Manchester City, and showed his quality against Leicester Sunday.

But Mane is available for European action, along with new signing Mohamed Salah, who has eased into life at Anfield with five goals, and Roberto Firmino. So Klopp has all Liverpool’s weapons at his disposal.
The German prefers a front-three of attacking players with two deeper midfielders behind. Should he remain with this formation, one of the four will have to watch from the sidelines Tuesday night.
Alternatively, Klopp could go all-out attack, play the quartet together and look to overpower Spartak with talent; Firmino upfront, Mane on the left and Salah on the right, with Coutinho picking up the No. 10 role in behind.
The issue for Klopp of late has not been his team’s attacking potential, though. Defensive woes have haunted the Liverpool manager, cost his team crucial points and irritated him in press conferences. So he may be unwilling to leave his defense even more exposed by adding to the attack.
Liverpool, meanwhile, has no new injury concerns. Klopp is still without Adam Lallana (thigh) and defender Nathaniel Clyne (hamstring).


Donald Trump tweeted an amendment to his usual statements about falling NFL television ratings early on Tuesday morning, noting the trend of pregame show audiences rising in line with the conjecture over whether, and which, players will kneel during the national anthem.
“Ratings for NFL football are way down except before game starts, when people tune in to see whether or not our country will be disrespected!” Trump  wrote.
There was certainly huge interest in the preamble to Monday Night Football, when the Dallas Cowboys travelled to the Arizona Cardinals. In the end, Jerry Jones and the Cowboys knelt briefly before the anthem before standing to acknowledge it, linking arms with the Cardinals at the same time in what  ESPN called a “unity statement.” Trump tweeted on Sunday that standing arm-in-arm during the anthem was acceptable. “Great solidarity for our National Anthem and for our Country. Standing with locked arms is good, kneeling is not acceptable. Bad ratings!" He wrote.
As it turned out, television ratings for the Cowboys’ 28-17 victory over the Cardinals rose 63 percent on the same date last year, when the Atlanta Falcons visited the New Orleans Saints in the Mercedes-Benz Superdome.  ESPN reported on Tuesday that Nielsen measured a 9.3 overnight rating for the game, peaking at 10.3 between 9:15 p.m. and 9:45 p.m. ET.
There are a couple of major reasons for this that have little to do with interest in, or displeasure at, the current player protests. The Saints-Falcons game took place on the same night as the first Presidential debate between Trump and Hillary Clinton at Hofstra University in New York. The Cowboys, meanwhile, are a consistent ratings monster capable of bucking trends and forces that would negatively affect smaller markets and teams.
Trump, for his part, seemed satisfied with the way the Cowboys had conducted their protest. After praising the “great anger” of the University of Phoenix crowd for booing while the Cowboys knelt, Trump  tweeted, “But while Dallas dropped to its knees as a team, they all stood up for our National Anthem. Big progress being made—we all love our country!”
While ratings fluctuated between the major television networks on Sunday—CBS saw an improvement for the Packers-Bengals game while Fox and NBC experienced dips—the popularity and notoriety of the Cowboys ensured Monday’s rating held up for ESPN. Next weekend’s games will shed a little more light on if, and how, the protests are going to affect NFL television audiences in the long-term.


It is seven years since the Lakers last won the Championship, beating the Boston Celtics 4-3 in the NBA Finals. Seven long years.
Among  the Lakers roster that day was Luke Walton, also part of  the Lakers team that won the championship the previous year. Now, however, Walton is on the sidelines, charged with returning the team to those heady days—but he insists he knows how to do it.
As  the Lakers prepare to begin a new campaign, starting with a training camp this week, Walton says there will be one main focus for the team in the days to come.
“Until we fix the defense it’s gonna be tough to win ballgames, which is ultimately what we want to do,” Walton told  SportsNet.
“First practice: All defense. We are not doing a single offensive drill in our first practice. Everything to us going into training camp is getting better on defense.”

Last season, the Lakers had the worst points differential of the whole league, with minus 6.9 points per game. But the team’s offense was far from outstanding given that they were only 17th in the league for scoring.
New additions to the roster will already help Walton and  the Lakers. Brook Lopez, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, and Andrew Bogut will all help protect the team defensively, while Josh Hart, a rookie, adds more depth for Walton.

Lakers shouldn’t have any problems in attack, however, especially after getting  Lonzo Ball in the draft earlier this summer, who then excelled in the summer league. His biggest admirer in L.A. seems to be the team’s president Magic Johnson.
Johnson has been effusive about the 19-year-old all summer, and the feeling has been mutual. “He’s the best point guard to ever play,” Ball said Monday, so it will please him to hear that Johnson believes that he possesses strong comparisons to him.

“I told him he's just like me. When I came here, there were a lot of expectations put on my shoulders and put on the Lakers as an organization,” Johnson said, as quoted by  NBC.
“I think now, as I told him, I'm his boss but I'm also his big brother. So, when he comes into my office, I don't want to be his boss. I just want to be his big brother and give him either a pat on the back or give him some information to help him.”
For now, however, Ball and the gang will have to focus on the defensive work if they want to win a championship again.


President Donald Trump, who over the last few days has repeatedly inserted himself into the country's most popular sport, tweeted Tuesday that he wants the NFL to create rules against football players kneeling in protest during the national anthem. He has a pretty good example for such a move in the U.S. Soccer Federation.
"The NFL has all sorts of rules and regulations. The only way out for them is to set a rule that you can't kneel during our National Anthem!" Trump tweeted Tuesday morning. 
The president has slammed players who kneel during the anthem to protest the oppression of black Americans. (It should be noted that the protests, sparked by Colin Kaepernick, have never been aimed at the anthem or the flag, as some have claimed. Rather, they're a peaceful demonstration during a quiet moment when folks are paying attention.) Trump even yelled at a rally that the league should fire any "son of a bitch" who kneeled. 
After much of the league, including owners, coaches and players, banded together last weekend over the issue, it seems unlikely the NFL will create new rules against demonstrations. But U.S. Soccer has already done so.
After the women's national team participated in protests last year, U.S. Soccer in March created a new bylaw that decreed: "All persons representing a Federation national team shall stand respectfully during the playing of national anthems at any event in which the Federation is represented." That's a slight but vastly important difference from the NFL regulation that "encourages" players to stand but does not require it. 
Star player Megan Rapinoe largely inspired the new rule. She had demonstrated in league games, and she sparked backlash after she kneeled before the U.S. team took on Thailand last September. 
“I'm very proud to pull on this shirt and play for this country, and also represent my country in a different way in speaking out for people that are oppressed,” she said during the ESPN broadcast, according to the Los Angeles Times. 

Rapinoe indicated at the time that she had planned to continue her protest. "As of now I plan to keep kneeling," she said, according to the Times. "I'm trying to kind of formulate a better plan and an action step moving forward. But until then, this is how I can help." 
But the bylaw stopped the star in her tracks. After the new rule from U.S. Soccer banning kneeling was adopted, Rapinoe said she would accept the decision. "I will respect the new bylaw the leadership at USSF has put forward," she said in a statement, via Fox Sports. "That said, I believe we should always value the use of our voice and platform to fight for equality of every kind."
It's unclear what the punishment for a player might be, should she or he disobey the rule, but it would reportedly be decided on a case-by-case basis. 


Donald Trump Jr.’s entrance into the argument around NFL player protests against racism provoked by his father last Friday night was at once entirely predictable and curious.
“If only Roger Goodell cared as much about domestic abuse and traumatic brain injury as he does about disrespecting America.” Donald Jr. tweeted on Monday, attacking the NFL Commissioner for a perceived lack of action over players kneeling during the national anthem. The NFL’s game operations manual states the league “may discipline” players who aren’t on the field by the start of the national anthem. That would include every member of the Pittsburgh Steelers apart from Alejandro Villanueva. The Steelers stayed in the locker room during the anthem prior to Sunday’s loss at Soldier Field against the Chicago Bears. The NFL, though, has yet to fine any player involved in the protests.
That Donald Jr. believes Goodell is guilty of double standards is hardly surprising. On Monday he tweeted out two stories, one from the Daily Caller that pointed out the NFL prevented the Dallas Cowboys from wearing police-themed decals, the other from Fox Business referencing the NFL fining players for sporting shoes honoring 9/11 victims. The son has been vociferous in his support for the father’s stance on social media.
So perhaps Donald Jr. was deflecting when he tweeted about “traumatic brain injury,” using concussions as a rhetorical tool to hammer on Goodell’s head. Just before he posted that, Donald Jr. retweeted a post apparently mocking those NFL players suffering from brain damage.
 
President Trump just proved that the folks with the highest rate of brain damage (according to science) think he&#39;s Hitler. #concussions https://t.co/jlRWOflDc9
 

And yet, the post still revealed a level of awareness surrounding concussions that Trump has yet to display. At the same rally in Alabama last Friday where he called on NFL owners to “fire” any player taking a knee during the national anthem, Trump called out football for “ruining” itself by adopting rules designed to limit hits to the head. (Despite what Donald Jr. says, the NFL has made serious attempts under Goodell to protect its players’ brains better). “Today if you hit too hard—15 yards! Throw him out of the game!” Trump said, reported by Sports Illustrated. “They had that last week. I watched for a couple of minutes. Two guys, just really, beautiful tackle. Boom, 15 yards! The referee gets on television—his wife is sitting at home, she’s so proud of him. They’re ruining the game! They’re ruining the game. That’s what they want to do. They want to hit. They want to hit! It is hurting the game.”
Trump’s comments on player safety came the day after the family of Aaron Hernandez, the former New England Patriots tight end, announced he had committed suicide in prison in April while suffering from Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy, the degenerative brain condition found in more than 100 deceased NFL players in a 2017 study conducted by the Boston University researcher Dr. Ann McKee. Shayanna Jenkins, Hernandez’s wife, plans to sue the NFL and the Patriots on behalf of their daughter for alleged negligence regarding Hernandez’s brain injuries.
Trump’s views on football and brain injury are consistent. At a campaign rally in Lakeland, Florida, in October 2016 the future president used the example of someone fainting in the crowd to pour scorn on the seriousness of concussion. “The woman was out cold and now she’s coming back,” Trump said, as reported by Sports Illustrated. “See? We don’t go by these new, and very much softer, NFL rules. Concussion. Oh, oh! Got a little ding on the head. No, no, you can’t play for the rest of the season. Our people are tough.”
In defending his father over a row about race, Trump Jr. perhaps inadvertently revealed himself to be at least a little wider awake than the president about concussion and brain injury, one of the NFL’s other, permanently looming crises. In these febrile days of their surreal war with America’s sporting institutions, the Trumps will surely cling to what succor they can.


Manchester United is already considering reigniting its interest in Atletico Madrid forward Antoine Griezmann following the return of Diego Costa to the Spanish capital, according to reports.
Chelsea finally came to an agreement for Costa to resign with Atletico last week, in a deal said to be worth around £57 million (about $76 million). That,  United hopes, will loosen Atletico’s hold on Griezmann who  United had a strong interest in during the summer, according to  ESPN.
Griezmann, the French forward, was expected to move to  United for a club-record fee at the beginning of the transfer window, but news of Atletico’s transfer ban ended that. The La Liga club is not allowed to register new players until January, which saw Griezmann commit his future to the club.

Instead,  Jose Mourinho added Romelu Lukaku to his attacking line for £75 million, Nemanja Matic made the switch from Chelsea, and Victor Lindelof bulked up his defense. The United boss wanted a fourth signing, an attacking player who could cut in from the wing, but that will have to wait.
Despite the deal appearing to go dead as Griezmann signed a one-year extension, ESPN  says United is as keen in signing the forward as he is on moving to Old Trafford. Griezmann’s new deal still has his original release clause of 100 million euros (£88m/$118m), which would see him become United’s second most expensive player.
Griezmann will be visiting England in December, but he’ll be in London. Atletico will face Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on December 5, but the two teams play first on Wednesday night at the Wanda Metropolitano in the second Group C Champions League game.
United, meanwhile, is in Russia for its Group A tie with CSKA Moscow. Mourinho’s team tops the group after winning the opening game 3-0, but is without midfield pair Marouane Fellaini and Paul Pogba, who are both injured.


The problem, for Jurgen Klopp this week, is that four doesn’t go into three. It’s a nice problem, one he wanted to have, was determined to have, but now finally faces.
His  Liverpool team is in Russia, preparing to take on Spartak Moscow in the second game of Group E, having drawn the first with Spanish side Sevilla. After recovering from a back injury, and his desire to leave Anfield in the summer, Philippe Coutinho is available for selection in Moscow.
The Brazilian midfielder, who was reportedly the subject of a £140 million offer (about $188 million) from Barcelona last month, returned to action for Liverpool’s 1-1 draw with Burnley 10 days ago. He fitted in, conveniently, for Sadio Mane, who was suspended after being dismissed for a high boot in the 5-0 defeat to Liverpool, and showed his quality against Leicester Sunday.

But Mane is available for European action, along with new signing Mohamed Salah, who has eased into life at Anfield with five goals, and Roberto Firmino. So Klopp has all Liverpool’s weapons at his disposal.
Related:   English Teams’ Injury News Ahead of Champions League Return
The German prefers a front-three of attacking players with two deeper midfielders behind. Should he remain with this formation, one of the four will have to watch from the sidelines Tuesday night.
Alternatively, Klopp could go all out attack, play the quartet together and look to overpower Spartak with talent; Firmino upfront, Mane on the left and Salah on the right, with Coutinho picking up the number 10 role in behind.
The issue for Klopp of late has not been his team’s attacking potential, though. Defensive woes have haunted the Liverpool manager, cost his team crucial points and irritated him in press conferences. So he may be unwilling to leave his defense even more exposed by adding to the attack.
Liverpool, meanwhile, has no new injury concerns. Klopp is still without Adam Lallana (thigh) and defender Nathaniel Clyne (hamstring).


There was a resounding message that took up many column inches on Monday discussing the NFL’s backlash toward the president: Donald Trump took on the NFL but lost, and he got it very wrong. Now, he needs to prepare himself for an even more impassioned opponent.
The  president’s message on Friday urged team owners to back him, saying “wouldn’t you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say, 'Get that son of a bitch off the field right now, out, he's fired. He's fired.'”
They, of course, didn’t. In fact,  Trump underestimated the impact of his words, seeing more and more players take a knee, link arms, or remain in the locker room during the national anthem. Even New England Patriots QB Tom Brady, who is a friend of the president's, came out and condemned his words, as “divisive.”
Trump thought he would have the backing of football, but he surely knows he doesn’t when it comes to the NBA. For a long time, key figures, such as  LeBron James and Steph Curry have spoken out about the president’s influence. The new NBA season is yet to start, but the players are managing to make their views heard in any way.

Curry made clear last week that he will not be attending the White House, as the championship-winning team usually does, which was followed on Saturday by Trump saying Curry’s invitation was withdrawn.
“By acting and not going, hopefully that will inspire some change when it comes to what we tolerate in this country and what is accepted and what we turn a blind eye to,” Curry said, as quoted by  The Washington Post. Though a rival on the court, James backed Curry both on social media, calling Trump a “bum”, and to reporters on Monday.
“Going to [the] White House was a great honor until you showed up!” James  wrote on Twitter. Speaking to the media on Monday, the Cavs man said he wouldn’t be surprised if the NBA staged protests when the season begins.
“He doesn’t understand the power that he has for being the leader of this beautiful country,” James said.
“He doesn’t understand how many kids, no matter the race, look up to the President of the United States for guidance, for leadership, for words of encouragement.”
James continued: “It’s powerful what all these athletes are doing. It’s not about disrespect for the flag and military and people who served. It’s about equality and having the option and freedom to speak about things they feel are unjust.”
L.A. Lakers legend  Kobe Bryant was also keen to have his voice heard on the subject over the weekend. On Saturday, he wrote on Twitter: “A #POTUS whose name alone creates division and anger. Whose words inspire dissension and hatred can’t possibly “Make America Great Again”.”
So while Colin Kaepernick remains on the sidelines, without a team in the NFL after being the first player to take a knee during the national anthem, the NBA’s biggest stars are ready to make even greater noise against Trump. Will the president be wise enough not to take on the NBA?


Donald Trump wants everyone to believe that player protests over the national anthem are negatively affecting the NFL’s popularity, hitting the league in its most sensitive area of television ratings. “Great solidarity for our National Anthem and for our Country. Standing with locked arms is good, kneeling is not acceptable. Bad ratings!” Trump tweeted on September 24. As a former—some might say current—television personality, Trump knows that falling ratings lead to a decline in advertising revenue for companies like CBS, NBC and Fox, the NFL’s major national television broadcasters. The controversy  could be bad news for television networks, if vast numbers of viewers decide to tune out all at once.
Trump isn’t right about “bad ratings,” though. Not exactly. In fact, he may be completely wrong in one sense. NFL pregame ratings on CBS and Fox were “significantly higher” on Sunday in comparison with previous weekends, the  Los Angeles Times reported on Monday, when purely football-related topics were discussed.  The NFL Today on CBS scored its highest rating since 2010, the newspaper reported, but viewership of the live games themselves still depended on the quality of the action and the teams involved. CBS benefited from an overtime thriller between the Packers and Cincinnati Bengals, while NBC and Fox showed less appealing games that contributed to an overall dip in viewership compared to the same weekend in 2016. The Redskins-Raiders game on NBC’s Sunday Night Football was down 11 percent on the equivalent game from Week Three in 2016,  Forbes reported.
Still, the dip in audience is hardly “way down” as Trump claimed again on September 24 in a separate tweet, on a weekend when he told a rally in Alabama that NFL owners should consider “firing” any player that kneels for the national anthem in solidarity with black America.  Forbes notes that the rise of internet streaming likely accounts for the NFL’s declining cable ratings, compounded more recently by the spate of hurricanes that have hit the south and east coasts. Trump acknowledged the popularity of the weekend's pregame shows in a tweet posted on Tuesday morning. "Ratings for NFL football are way down except before game starts, when people tune in to see whether or not our country will be disrespected!" He wrote.It seems likely, and logical, that Trump’s vast social media presence—his personal Twitter account has around 39.3 million followers—is helping to bring a new audience to a league and sport electrified by the president’s very public opposition. Austin Karp, an editor at the respected  SportsBusiness Daily, tweeted on Monday: “Fans wanted to see NFL talking heads react to Trump.”
 
Fans yesterday wanted to see NFL talking heads react to Trump. Fox 11am NFL show, +30%. Fox NFL Sunday, +9%. CBS&#39; The NFL Today, +33%.
 

The president wants the American public to turn off the NFL. But he may have enlivened a whole new audience to the league.


Donald Trump continued his running battle with the NFL Monday night, dragging Chief of Staff John Kelly and CNN into the debate.
“.@CNN is #FakeNews. Just reported COS (John Kelly) was opposed to my stance on NFL players disrespecting FLAG, ANTHEM, COUNTRY. Total lie!” Trump tweeted late Monday.
CNN had claimed in a report Monday evening that Kelly, a former United States Marine, was “not pleased” with the way Trump’s comments erupted into a fight over the weekend between the president and the country’s biggest sports leagues, including the NFL and NBA. At a rally in Alabama Friday, Trump spoke of his desire to see NFL owners “fire” NFL players who kneel during the national anthem, a gesture that has become widespread since former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick first performed it in a regular-season game last September in protest at the mistreatment of minorities in the United States.
Kelly, whose son Robert Michael was killed in combat in Afghanistan in 2010, told CNN Monday night he believed players should stand for the anthem. "I believe every American, when the national anthem is played, should cover their hearts and think about all the men and women who have been maimed and killed," Kelly said.
Trump’s comments—he also attacked Stephen Curry, the Golden State Warriors point guard, on Twitter on Saturday by rescinding his invitation to visit the White House—have drawn widespread condemnation from inside the NFL. Commissioner Roger Goodell called them “divisive,” while the players made their point during Sunday’s games.
The Pittsburgh Steelers, with the exception of Alejandro Villanueva, refused to leave the locker room during the national anthem, while the Baltimore Ravens and Jacksonville Jaguars knelt for the Star Spangled Banner before their game at Wembley Stadium in London. On Monday Night Football, the Dallas Cowboys and owner Jerry Jones knelt briefly but stood for the anthem, with the Cowboys and home-town Arizona Cardinals linking arms during the anthem. Jones had previously voiced his belief in “respect for the American flag.”
The White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, spent the first part of her press briefing Monday answering questions on Trump’s row with the NFL. “It’s always appropriate for the president of this country to promote our flag, to promote the National Anthem, and ask people to respect it,” Sanders said in defense of Trump, who himself  claimed Monday that his comments had “nothing to do with race.”
Sanders also, somewhat confusingly, appeared to suggest NFL players should “protest officers on the field” rather than the American flag. “I think if the debate for them is really about police brutality they should protest the officers on the field that are protecting them instead of the American flag,” she said in quotes reported by  Variety, later clarifying, “That if the goal is and the message is police brutality which they have stated, then that doesn’t seem very appropriate that they would protest the American flag.”
Trump was not finished at one tweet, sending out another two minutes later refuting CNN’s story. “General John Kelly totally agrees w/ my stance on NFL players and the fact that they should not be disrespecting our FLAG or GREAT COUNTRY!”
In a more general tweet returning to his theme of the NFL losing popularity over the protests, Trump ended his barrage with: “Tremendous backlash against the NFL and its players for disrespect of our Country.” Trump vs. the National Football League shows no sign of abating any time soon.


Two National Football League teams largely steered clear of a controversy over national anthem protests that have ensnared U.S. President Donald Trump and threatened to damage the game’s popularity, staging a “moment of unity” on Monday instead.
The entire Dallas Cowboys team, including owner Jerry Jones, linked arms and knelt on the playing field for a moment before the game, but then stood respectfully as the “Star-Spangled Banner” was performed by singer Jordin Sparks.
“We all agreed that our players wanted to make a statement about unity and make a statement about equality,” Jones said after his team beat the Arizona Cardinals 28-17.
Jones has previously expressed pride that no players on his team had taken to one knee as the anthem was played and said he was disappointed to see such protests.
Cardinals players joined arms as a giant flag was unfurled on the field but did not kneel.
“Prior to the National Anthem, the @DallasCowboys and @AZCardinals shared a moment of unity on the field,” the NFL said in a Twitter post that was retweeted by the Cowboys.
Former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick stirred a polarizing national debate in 2016 after refusing to stand during pre-game renditions of the “Star Spangled Banner” to protest against police violence against African-Americans.
Kaepernick was not signed by an NFL team this season but several players have made similar gestures.
Trump kicked off his battle with the largest-grossing U.S. professional sports league at a rally on Friday, when he said any protesting player was a “son of a bitch” who should be “fired.”Those remarks touched off protests by dozens of NFL players, coaches and even some owners at games on Sunday, along with criticism from many corners of the sports world.
“The childishness, the gratuitous fear-mongering and race baiting has become so consistent that we almost expect it, the bar has been lowered so far,” Gregg Popovich, head coach of the San Antonio Spurs basketball team, told reporters.
The head of the U.S. Olympic Committee (USOC) spoke out in support of the protesters at NFL games.
“The athletes you see protesting are protesting because they love their country,” USOC Chief Executive Scott Blackmun told reporters in Park City, Utah.
The International Olympic Committee’s charter prohibits “demonstrations of political, religious or racial propaganda” at Olympic venues.
Not all players joined in Sunday’s protests. Notably, Pittsburgh Steelers lineman Alejandro Villanueva, a U.S. Army veteran, stood alone at the entrance to the stadium for the anthem on Sunday while his teammates waited in the locker room.
Villanueva jerseys and other apparel have outsold those of all other players in the past 24 hours, said a spokesman for online retailer Fanatics, which operates NFLShop.com.
Villanueva’s teammate, Ben Roethlisberger, said on Monday he regretted having missed the anthem.
“I was unable to sleep last night,” Roethlisberger said in a statement. “I personally don’t believe the Anthem is ever the time to make any type of protest.”
Trump kept up his verbal battle with the players on Monday, saying on Twitter that his objection to the protests had nothing to do with race but was “about respect for our Country, Flag and National Anthem. NFL must respect this!”
The president, who has called for a boycott of NFL games, also tweeted: “Tremendous backlash against the NFL and its players for disrespect of our Country.”
The demonstrations have become a thorny issue for the league, which has sought to support players’ rights to protest while trying to keep politics from overshadowing games.
CBS Corp said overall viewership of games it broadcast on Sunday was up 4 percent from last year and 1 percent from last week. NBC, owned by Comcast Corp, said viewership for its Sunday night game was down compared with the week before.
“The protest has nothing to do with respecting the flag. I agree with their message but not doing it during the anthem,” U.S. Air Force veteran Jimmy Phillips, 43, said before Monday’s game in Phoenix.
Nike Inc said it supported athletes who had joined the protests.
“Nike supports athletes and their right to freedom of expression on issues that are of great importance to our society,” Nike said in a statement.
The debate attracted intense attention online, with the hashtag “#TakeAKnee” racking up 2.4 million mentions and “#TakeTheKnee” used 1.2 million times by Monday, while “#BoycottNFL” had 101,500 mentions.
Prominent players continued to speak out against Trump on Monday.
New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady, who has said he considers Trump a friend, said on Monday he disagreed with the president’s remarks.
“I thought it was just divisive,” Brady told Boston’s WEEI radio.
At the same time as he berated the NFL, Trump praised car-racing league NASCAR, which saw no protests at its Sunday race in New Hampshire.


Mauricio Pochettino will have to shuffle his Tottenham team Tuesday night as Spurs has been hit with a flurry of injuries before the Champions League tie.
The Argentine’s team is in Cyprus for the second game in Group H, facing Apoel Nicosia while Jurgen Klopp’s Liverpool and Pep Guardiola’s Manchester City are also in action.
Pochettino has known he will be without midfielder Dele Alli and central defender Jan Vertonghen due to suspension, but is missing key players due to injury.
Alli’s absence is even more concerning for Pochettino as he will be without Danish playmaker Christian Eriksen due to illness.
Moussa Dembele is unlikely to feature after getting a knock to his ankle during Spurs’ 3-2 win over West Ham at the London Stadium on Sunday. Victor Wanyama remains on the sidelines with a knee injury.
Erik Lamela has not played since October 2016 due to a hip injury, and will not be back for the trip to Cyprus, nor will left-back Danny Rose, who has been out for eight months.
Ahead of Manchester City’s Group F match against Shakhtar Donetsk, Guardiola’s is sweating over the fitness of Benjamin Mendy, the City left-back signed from Monaco in the summer who has eased into the Premier League. The Frenchman limped off during City’s 5-0 win over Crystal Palace at the weekend.
Guardiola knows he will be without club captain Vincent Kompany due to a calf strain. The Belgian center back has not played since August, following a 9-0 win for his country over Gibraltar.
After Ilkay Gundogan’s 10-month return from an anterior cruciate ligament injury in his right knee, the German midfielder suffered a sprain to his left knee in a the Carabao Cup last week. Gundogan is not expected to be available for Tuesday.
Liverpool has no new injury concerns ahead of its game against Spartak Moscow, but Klopp is still without Adam Lallana due to a problem with his thigh and Nathaniel Clyne who has a hamstring issue.

Donald Trump says he is “so proud” of NASCAR after team owners backed the president by threatening to fire drivers who protest the national anthem.
Trump tweeted his support of the sport on Monday morning following strong words by NASCAR owners including Richard Childress and Hall of Fame driver Richard Petty against the "take a knee" protests in the NFL.
“So proud of NASCAR and its supporters and fans,” Trump wrote on Twitter. “They won’t put up with disrespecting our Country or our Flag - they said it loud and clear!”
Both Childress and Petty were direct with their views, with Petty threatening to fire anyone that didn't stand for the anthem.
“It’ll get you a ride on a Greyhound bus,” Childress said, as quoted by The Guardian. “Anybody that works for me should respect the country we live in. So many people gave their lives for it. This is America.”

Petty went even further, saying that “anybody that don’t stand up for the anthem oughta be out of the country. Period. What got ’em where they’re at? The United States,” adding that any protester from Richard Petty Motorsports would be fired.
The threats follow Trump’s call on Friday for owners of  NFL teams to fire any player that takes a knee during the national anthem, which didn’t receive the reaction in the sport that he’d hoped.

On Sunday, there were protests across the league, with more than 20 players kneeling at London’s Wembley stadium on Sunday where the Jacksonville Jaguars were playing the Baltimore Ravens. Jaguars owner Shahid Khan also joined in the protest.
Back home, members of the Titans and the Seahawks opted to stay in the locker rooms during the anthem.
Trump continued to comment on the subject on Twitter. “Many people booed the players who kneeled yesterday (which was a small percentage of total). These are fans who demand respect for our Flag!
“The issue of kneeling has nothing to do with race. It is about respect for our Country, Flag and National Anthem. NFL must respect this!”


Amid the brouhaha caused by his repeated attacks on the NFL and NBA over the weekend, Donald Trump sought support from an unlikely source Sunday evening.
“Please [sic] to inform that the Champion Pittsburgh Penguins of the NHL will be joining me at the White House for Ceremony. Great team!” Trump tweeted Sunday.
The Penguins, led by superstar Canadian center Sidney Crosby, beat the Nashville Predators in the Stanley Cup finals in June by four games to two. The Penguins released a statement Sunday confirming Trump’s tweet, saying they “respect the office of the President.”
“The Pittsburgh Penguins respect the institution of the Office of the President, and the long tradition of championship teams visiting the White House,” the statement read as reported by the  Pittsburgh Gazette. “We attended White House ceremonies after previous championships—touring the historic building and visiting briefly with Presidents George H.W. Bush and Barack Obama—and have accepted an invitation to attend again this year.”
“Any agreement or disagreement with a president's politics, policies or agenda can be expressed in other ways. However, we very much respect the rights of other individuals and groups to express themselves as they see fit.”
Trump began his stormy weekend of feuding with the United States’ professional sports organizations at a rally in Alabama Friday, when he called for NFL owners to “fire” players who kneel during the anthem.
Then Trump called out Stephen Curry, the Golden State Warriors point guard, announcing via Twitter that Curry’s invitation to the White House as part of the Warriors’ NBA Championship-winning team had been rescinded. Curry had already said he would not take up the invitation, while rival NBA star LeBron James called Trump a “bum” for the tweet.
While Trump looks to have turned most of the NFL and NBA against him—Sunday’s NFL games featured widespread gestures of defiance from players in light of his comments—ice hockey and the NHL seem like odd bedfellows for Trump. The Penguins’ roster features 17 players from the United States, par for the course in a sport and league dominated by Canadians and Russians.
A friend in need is a friend indeed, though. Having done his best to alienate football and basketball, Trump could probably do with some support from the neglected half-brother of American sports.


President Trump has condemned NFL players more harshly than he did neo-Nazis, says Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Alex Smith.
Trump urged the owners of football teams to fire any players who took a knee during the national anthem, and for fans to leave the stadium. “Wouldn't you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say, 'Get that son of a bitch off the field right now, out, he's fired. He's fired',” he said.
Smith described the criticism as “alarming” as the president was “targeting the NFL, targeting the quality and character of guys in this league for that very protest.”
The 33-year-old said he felt uncomfortable talking about politics but that Trump’s comments had “upset” him.
“It’s the same guy who couldn’t condemn violent neo-Nazis,” Smith said, as quoted by  The Hill. “And he’s condemning guys taking a knee during the anthem.
“There are bigger issues out there that he probably should be worried about. But for some reason the NFL is on his mind.”
Last month, one person died and 19 others were injured when a car, allegedly driven by a white supremacist, rammed into a crowd of people opposing a far-right rally in Virginia.
At the time Trump condemned “in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry, and violence on many sides,” failing to specifically denounce the far-right.
Smith continued to say that the NFL is “not perfect” but that he is proud of teammates. On Sunday, many players, coaches and owners took part in a protest following Trump’s criticism.
“There are so many good things, great things that go on in this league,” Smith said. “It struck a chord a little bit to see guys get attacked for a peaceful protest.”


Over the years, footballers’ celebrations have become as choreographed as the plays that produce touchdowns. From the Redskins’ fun bunch celebration to the Falcons’ dirty bird, players have continually reacted to TDs in entertaining ways.
But  Odell Beckham Jr. produced one of the more bizarre celebrations after his first score on Sunday, in the Giants 24-27 defeat to the Eagles in Philadelphia. The 24-year-old wide-receiver fell to all fours and crawled along the floor before simulating the act of peeing like a dog.
Inevitably, Beckham was asked after the game for the meaning behind his celebration, but gave little explanation. “I don’t know,”  he said. “I’m in the end zone, I’m a dog, so I acted like a dog.”
Take a look at the celebration:
Odell Beckham pees like a dog. pic.twitter.com/uBZqGNIZ1o

When Beckham hit the end zone for a second time, he raised his first to the sky. This act seemed more in tune with a theme running throughout the NFL this weekend, with teams defying the words of  President Trump.
On Friday,  Trump said NFL owners should fire players who took a knee during the national anthem. "Wouldn't you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say, 'Get that son of a bitch off the field right now, out, he's fired. He's fired,'" Trump said.
“You know, some owner is going to do that. And that owner, they'll be the most popular person in this country.”
On Sunday, before the Baltimore Ravens and Jacksonville Jaguars met at Wembley Stadium in London, the players defied the words of Trump and took a knee during the national anthem.
But Beckham wouldn’t reveal whether his fist to the sky was a message to Trump. “Did it look like it [meant something]?”  he said. “Then it might have meant something.”

Donald Trump went into battle with the NFL over the weekend, sparking a backlash and a show of unity from the league’s players and team owners on Sunday night.
After provoking a defiant reaction with his comments at a rally in Alabama on Friday that NFL owners should “fire” any player taking a knee during the national anthem, Trump continued his barrage on Sunday evening.
“Sports fans should never condone players that do not stand proud for their National Anthem or their Country. NFL should change policy!” Trump tweeted during the league’s Sunday night schedule.
Sports fans should never condone players that do not stand proud for their National Anthem or their Country. NFL should change policy!

While the president was likely trying to appeal to his right-wing supporter base with his calls for defense of patriotism, there could be another, less obvious reason for Trump’s decision to take on one of the world’s biggest and most lucrative sports brands.
During  Sky Sports’ broadcast of the Kansas City Chiefs’ victory over the Los Angeles Chargers at StubHub Center Sunday,  Sports Illustrated  and Monday Morning Quarterback writer Peter King appeared via video link to provide analysis of the weekend’s events.
Trump, King suggested, has held a grudge against the NFL since 2014, when he failed in an attempt to buy the Buffalo Bills franchise.
“I’m going to give it [buying the Bills] a heavy shot,” Trump told the  Buffalo News in April 2014. “I would love to do it, and if I can do it I’m keeping it in Buffalo.”
It didn’t happen, of course. While Trump did join the bidding process, part of an eclectic cast including Jon Bon Jovi, the team was eventually sold to Terry Pegula. “I bid a billion dollars, all cash on the table,” Trump told  Sports Illustrated in September 2015. “He [Pegula] bought it for a billion-two, I believe, although they say it was a billion-four. I think he got it for a billion‑two.”
Trump’s bruised ego was evident from his tweets following the Bills’ sale. In October 2014 he wrote:
Even though I refused to pay a ridiculous price for the Buffalo Bills, I would have produced a winner. Now that won’t happen.

While the Bills have mostly been terrible since Pegula took control, they have shown signs of life this season. Under head coach Sean McDermott, the Bills are first in the AFC East ahead of the New England Patriots and took out an impressive victory over the Denver Broncos at Ralph Wilson Stadium on Sunday.
At least Trump could once count on the team he failed to buy being terrible. The Bills’ improvement may just compound a difficult weekend for the president.


The weekend that woke the United States up—and reminded everyone including President Donald Trump that athletes can have a powerful political voice—also dragged a famously reticent megastar into the debate.
Michael Jordan, the current owner of the Charlotte Hornets and de-facto greatest basketball player of all time, told the  Charlotte Observer Sunday night that those athletes taking a knee during the national anthem should not be “demonized or ostracized.”
“One of the fundamental rights this country is founded on was freedom of speech, and we have a long tradition of nonviolent, peaceful protest. Those who exercise the right to peacefully express themselves should not be demonized or ostracized,” Jordan said.
“At a time of increasing divisiveness and hate in this country, we should be looking for ways to work together and support each other and not create more division.
“I support Commissioner Adam Silver, the NBA, its players and all those who wish to exercise their right to free speech.”
Trump provoked one of the more extraordinary weekends in the history of U.S. professional sport when he told a rally in Alabama on Friday that NFL owners should respond to their players’ peaceful protest by saying, “Get that son of a bitch off the field right now, he's fired. He's fired!"
In a separate gesture, Trump then rescinded via Twitter an invitation to the White House for Golden State Warriors point guard Stephen Curry that Curry had already refused. Trump’s behavior appeared to solidify the NFL against him, with players linking arms on the sidelines and the Pittsburgh Steelers refusing to exit the locker room altogether for the anthem.
“Going to the White House is considered a great honor for a championship team.Stephen Curry is hesitating, therefore invitation is withdrawn!” Trump tweeted. Curry described the rejection as “surreal” in quotes reported by the  Washington Post.
Jordan’s intervention is significant because, as perhaps the United States’ highest-profile black athlete, he has been known for his reluctance to comment on political issues. A  Slate article published in July 2016 recalls Jordan’s controversial non-endorsement of Harvey Gantt, the black North Carolina Democrat, against Jesse Helms in the 1990 Senate race. Legend has it that Jordan justified his decision to stay out of the election by saying, “Republicans buy sneakers too,” although that has never been verified.
Trump’s comments, though, are dragging even the most politically bashful athletes out of their shells. Jordan’s intervention is another significant moment on an extraordinary long weekend.


President Donald Trump tweeted Sunday about the NFL's television ratings being down—and for the most part that's correct. But he seemed to be somewhat wrong about why the ratings were down.
"NFL attendance and ratings are WAY DOWN. Boring games yes, but many stay away because they love our country. League should back U.S." he tweeted early Sunday as NFL players took knees and locked arms during the national anthem amid the president's repeated recent criticisms of players who do so. 
"Great solidarity for our National Anthem and for our Country. Standing with locked arms is good, kneeling is not acceptable. Bad ratings!" he tweeted later.

For the most part, NFL ratings are down. (It's worth noting that even bad NFL ratings are amazing compared with nearly everything else on television, including every other major American sport.)
The website Sports Media Watch posted a helpful graphic of the major games thus far in the NFL season (not counting Sunday's matchups since the ratings were not out yet) and nearly every important game had ratings that were down or relatively flat. This week's Thursday Night Football game, however, was actually up 38 percent. The late game on Fox last week was up 17 percent as well. But most of the other major games were down anywhere from 3 percent to 28 percent. CBS's Sunday games, for instance, were down about 10 percent from last year. The Hollywood Reporter reported that ratings were down 15 percent in Week 2, even after ratings were down 8 percent last year.
Trump tweeted that the NFL being "boring" had some effect on its ratings, and he might have a point there. Some league observers have noted the quality of play has been down, including Kevin Clark at The Ringer in a story titled "How Football Stopped Being Fun." 
But experts have said the ratings in the first week were likely affected by massive hurricanes that the struck the country. It's also very early in the season and—importantly—if ratings are actually down and stay that way, it's likely more a sign of the changing media landscape rather than fans tuning out because of protests. 
"In general people's attention spans have changed," Brian Hughes, a senior vice president at audience tracking firm Magna, told CNN. "There's evidence that people are intensely interested in fewer things and generally interested in more things, and I think that's a function of deluge of content that we are finding ourselves in nowadays."
Sports Illustrated's media reporter Richard Deitsch wrote this week that you "can make some legitimate ratings assessments by Week Four," while Ad Age's Anthony Crupi wrote about NFL ratings on Twitter: "It's early yet. No need to snort a Xanax."
The effect of the protests on ratings, which Trump apparently feels is real, is not 100 percent clear either. Even as the Kaepernick controversy continues (many league observers think he deserves an NFL job), the protests were actually less of a story this season until Trump resurfaced the issue. It wasn't as much a part of the national conversation as it was last year, when the quarterback was in the league.
But some fans certainly have expressed the anthem protests playing a part in tuning out. As reported by ESPN, a J.D. Power poll found that just 12 percent of respondents (who went to at least one major sporting game) described watching fewer NFL games. Of those who said they watched fewer football games, 26 percent described doing so because of anthem protests (note the survey was not open-ended, meaning this option was presented to them). Still, other reasons combined to outweigh the anthem protests, such as domestic violence issues within the league (24 percent), excessive commercials (20 percent), being distracted by the 2016 election (16 percent) and cord-cutting (5 percent). 
This survey has been oft-cited by conservatives like Trump, but as a Washington Post analysis of the poll pointed out that if you actually look at the data it shows some people likely did tune out because of the protests but it's not a "fair conclusion" to say it was the main driver for a ratings decline. 
So Trump was correct that ratings have been down and he's not wrong that some may have tuned out because of protests. But a lot of nuance got lost in the 140 character missives. 



If Thursday night's game between the Rams and 49ers was any indication, we could be in for an action-packed third week of the NFL season. Jared Goff and the Rams held on for a wild 41-39 victory against their division rival, bucking Thursday Night Football's habit of producing sluggish, boring football. Bring on the points!

In addition to the Broncos trying to move to 3-0, the Giants trying to stave off 0-3 and the Colts and Browns trying to draw viewers who aren't in the immediate families of the players, Week 3 will also bring the first London game of the season, between the 2-0 Ravens and the 1-1 Jaguars. You'll probably have to set an alarm if you want to watch it, though. It begins at 9:30 a.m. on the East Coast and, gulp, 6:30 a.m. out west.

“The Black Mamba” struck Saturday away from the NBA court. This time on Twitter and against President Donald Trump.
Retired five-time NBA champion Kobe Bryant, who famously nicknamed himself after a black snake, used Trump’s signature phrase “Make America Great Again” against him.
“A #POTUS whose name alone creates division and anger. Whose words inspire dissension and hatred can't possibly ‘Make America Great Again,’” the retired Los Angeles Lakers superstar, destined to be inducted into the Hall of Fame, tweeted.

Initially, the tweet had a typo that Bryant fixed, and a Twitter user pointed out Bryant’s renowned work ethic. That prompted Bryant to tweet back “#mambamentality.”

The comment followed a whirlwind 24 hours for Trump, the NBA and some of its biggest stars. Before Bryant, Golden State Warriors point guard Stephen Curry said he would not visit the White House if the rest of his team did, which prompted Trump to tweet Saturday he rescinded the invitation.
Trump’s disinvite of Curry then resulted in Cleveland Cavaliers forward LeBron James to clap back and call the president a “bum” and state visiting the White House was an honor before the Republican billionaire moved in. Thus far, the tweet has garnered more than 600,000 likes.

Other NBA stars like Houston Rockets point guard Chris Paul also took to Twitter in Curry’s defense to tell Trump he should be focused on other matters while serving as president rather than players refusing to stand for the national anthem or visiting the White House.

Paul also touched on Trump calling NFL players a “son of bitch” for not standing for the anthem, doubting Trump would insult them to “their face.”

Championship teams from professional sports leagues, as well as college teams, traditionally visit Washington and meet with the president after claiming their titles. Most recently, the NFL’s New England Patriots went in April but several players skipped the event, with some citing Trump’s politics. Quarterback Tom Brady did not attend but cited “family matters.”


Cleveland Cavaliers star LeBron James has faced comparisons to NBA Hall of Fame and Chicago Bulls great Michael Jordan throughout his career, with most claiming Jordan was the greatest of all time, or the GOAT, for winning more championships.
Jordan claimed six championships during his career, twice winning three consecutive titles in a row, while James has hoisted three championship trophies—two with the Miami Heat and one with Cleveland.
That is until James took to Twitter Saturday to call President Donald Trump a “bum” while defending rival Golden State Warrior Stephen Curry, who said Friday he did not want to visit the White House with the rest of his championship squad.

Trump tweeted Saturday that the invitation to the Warriors, who defeated James’ Cavs in June for their second championship in three years, was “rescinded.”
James fired back by stating such visits were an honor until Trump became president. That tweet became the most “liked” James has ever sent out with almost 500,000, while Trump’s call out of Curry garnered more than 100,000 likes.

The feud has since taken over social media, with many pointing out how Jordan, who is alleged to have said that Republicans also buy sneakers, has not been more outspoken on political and social issues.
The trends, including the hashtag “#uBum,” all pointed to James coming to Curry’s aide, as well as other current stars like the Houston Rockets’ Chris Paul and James’ teammate JR Smith. 









The users are, of course, speaking figuratively since Jordan and James never shared a court or faced head-to-head.
The reactions appear to be based more on Trump’s widespread unpopularity and attack Friday during a rally in Alabama. Trump also called for NFL owners to fire players who kneel or sit during the national anthem.


Shortly after making controversial comments about the NFL, President Donald Trump moved on to the NBA.
On Saturday morning he tweeted that the Golden State Warriors--the 2017 NBA Champions--are no longer invited to the White House. It’s not clear whether his statement is referring to the entire team or just Warriors guard Stephen Curry.
“Going to the White House is considered a great honor for a championship team.Stephen Curry is hesitating,therefore invitation is withdrawn!” he wrote.
Trump's comments come less than 24 hours after Curry, two-time MVP, said he doesn’t have any intention to go to the White House and hopes his team can make a statement.
“I don’t want to go. . .my beliefs stay the same,” Curry told reporters during a news conference.

“By acting and not going, hopefully that will inspire some change when it comes to what we tolerate in this country, what is accepted and what we turn a blind eye toward,” Curry said when asked what declining the visit would mean, according to Anthony Slater,  who covers the Warriors for The Athletic.

Many have took to Twitter to support Curry’s decision.




Curry isn’t the first player on the Warriors to speak out against the visit, which is a tradition by U.S champion teams that dates back to at least 1865. In August, his teammate, Kevin Durant, said he would skip it too.
"I don't agree with what he agrees with, so my voice is going to be heard by not doing that," Durant told ESPN. "That's just me personally, but if I know my guys well enough, they'll all agree with me."

Earlier in the year, New England Patriot's Tom Brady skipped the celebratory White House visit, citing 'personal family matters,' but Trump did not comment on Brady's decision.
On Friday night, Trump also criticized NFL players who choose to protest by sitting during the playing of the national anthem. During the political rally in Huntsville, Alabama to campaign for Sen. Luther Strange (R-Ala.), he said: "Wouldn't you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say, 'Get that son of a b---- off the field right now. Out. He's fired! He's fired!"
NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell released a statement on Saturday morning responding to Trump’s comments.
“The NFL and our players are at our best when we help create a sense of unity in our country and our culture.  There is no better example than the amazing response from our clubs and players to the terrible natural disasters we've experienced over the last month.  Divisive comments like these demonstrate an unfortunate lack of respect for the NFL, our great game and all of our players, and a failure to understand the overwhelming force for good our clubs and players represent in our communities.”


Tottenham Hotspur striker Harry Kane scored twice as Tottenham survived a late fight back from West Ham to move into third place in the Premier League.
In-form striker Kane fired the visitors into a two goal lead before half time, marking seven goals in six outings against West Ham and a total of 21 in 29 Premier League outings against all the London clubs combined, the Daily Mail reports.

Kane was inches away from a hat-trick for the second time when he hit a 59 minute free-kick against the post but barely a minute passed before midfielder Christian Eriksen claimed a third for Spurs, as he slipped in Serge Aurier's deflected cross.
However, five minutes later West Ham claimed a goal back through Mexico forward Javier Hernandez, who headed in from close range.
Twenty minutes from time and Tottenham were down to ten men, after defender Serge Aurier was shown a second yellow card for a late tackle on forward Andy Carroll.
West Ham pressed forward, and claimed another goal back three minutes from time when Cheikhou Kouyate blasted in a ball from substitute Arthur Masuaku.
Tottenham held on to claim their third consecutive league victory, and consigned West Ham to their fourth league defeat this season.


In 1971, international tennis star Billie Jean King began a secret relationship with Marilyn Barnett. What unfolded between the two women was marked by the repression of that period, and their affair nearly destroyed King's career.
This Friday, audiences will fall in love with King, as played by Emma Stone, in Battle of the Sexes. They'll also watch a fictionalized version of King meeting Barnett (Andrea Risenborough), the hair stylist who eventually became King's personal assistant and girlfriend, though King was married. The true nature of their love affair was much more toxic than the film suggests.

Because of the legal limitations on lesbian relationships at the time, Barnett and King’s breakup was particularly damaging to King’s tennis career when it was exposed. The world now celebrates King’s monumental gift to women’s tennis, but the rest of her story is a reminder of how the world treated women just years ago. When Barnett sued King in 1981, for instance, King's counsel was able to use the fact that no legal protections existed for lesbian couples. "Palimony law," which Barnett tried to invoke, had never protected two women's assets after a romantic relationship, and she lost her case against King. The scandal of having been in a relationship with a woman, King says now, kept her on the court, earning money though she had wanted to retire.
Though our society is slightly more inclined to celebrate queer athletes than we were in the 1970s, the law hasn't fully caught up to public opinion. Gay marriage became legal across the United States only in 2015. Before 2017, it was still legal in many states for an employer to terminate someone simply because the person identified as queer; the decision to protect LGBT employees' jobs was made at the federal level only this year, and even then, the decision wasn't unanimous. If King was faced with coming out now, she'd still have to grapple with possible damage to her public image, finances and career.

King is now considered a feminist and a lesbian icon, but she didn't have agency in her own coming-out story; Barnett forcibly outed her when they broke up. Pressure from her family and colleagues meant King had to distance herself from both Barnett and her actual sexuality, telling the press that her affair had been a product of deep loneliness and not a real attraction to women. It took decades for King to reclaim what had been taken from her.
King told The New York Times in a 2006 feature that she discovered her attraction to women in 1968. “The whole world was in tumult, and so was I," King said. "I was so ashamed." She didn’t tell her family or husband about her feelings and was unprepared to cope when she met Barnett.
Barnett and King began their affair in 1971, six months after first meeting, according to The Boston Globe. Also in 1971, King privately had an abortion, which her husband made public without her knowledge in 1972, by giving his wife’s name to Ms. magazine. King appeared in a feature about high-profile, pro-choice women and didn’t know the piece was being published. It was yet another example of King's public image being manipulated by those around her.

According to one biography of King, she compartmentalized her romantic feelings for Barnett by hiring her as a personal assistant and bringing her on the road, reportedly paying her $600 a month. Barnett and King ended their seven-year relationship in 1979, and King asked Barnett to vacate the Malibu beach house where King had been allowing Barnett to stay. Until 1981, news of their affair and breakup stayed private, until Barnett sued King publicly.
Barnett attempted suicide unsuccessfully in 1981, the same year the trial concluded, and was left paralyzed from the waist down. To date, King has never commented on Barnett's actions.

It took decades for King, whom President Barack Obama gave the National Medal of Freedom in 2009 for her work in women’s advocacy and LGBT initiatives, to publicly admit to being gay, not because of a lack of courage (as Vanity Fair suggested in 2008) but because her livelihood would have been crushed if she had come out during her career. Battle of the Sexes, though it frames the initial attraction between King and Barnett in a lovely way, doesn’t fully engage with the insidious world in which the two women met.
Battle of the Sexes paints King as a triumphant figure in athletics, but it doesn't fully explore how King's queerness was treated widely as perversion for years. While her true story doesn’t negate what she did for women’s tennis in 1973, it exposes how our culture pounded guilt and shame into an American icon for decades. The film does King's legacy a disservice by not taking those around her to task, and it has already been called into question for letting Bobby Riggs off the hook for his performative misogyny, putting the onus instead on promoter Jack Kramer (Bill Pullman).
By telling a famous lesbian's story in soft focus, romanticizing her first connections with women and not taking to task the system that controlled her, Battle of the Sexes ignores some of the most difficult aspects of King's life. One recalls other historical biopics about queer figures in the media, The Imitation Game and The Danish Girl included, which integrate their subject's sexuality and gender identity into their portrayal while communicating the full scope of the distress they felt as they became self-actualized.
There has to be a way to tell stories about queer women without characterizing their sexualities as "alternative" and by forcing society to contend with its historical errors. Though large-scale changes in law to support queer Americans are undoubtedly important and worth celebrating, King's story proves that discrimination against lesbians often happens within legal loopholes. By shedding a light on the way insidious homophobia finds a way into our world, future projects about queer American heroes will enact cultural change of their own. It's not enough to tell an uplifting story; we have to find art in our mistakes.
Battle of the Sexes is in theaters nationwide.


Chelsea forward Pedro will return to Antonio Conte’s squad for the trip to Stoke on Saturday, while Tiémoué Bakayoko is available despite being involved in a car accident on Thursday.
Bakayoko, the midfield summer signing from Monaco, was in a minor car crash on his way home from Chelsea's training complex on Thursday, according to ESPN. Conte confirmed that it would not affect the Frenchman's involvement in Saturday's game at the Bet365 Stadium. 
Conte will also have Pedro, the Spanish forward, available to him, as well as PFA Player of the Year Eden Hazard. "All the players are available apart from [Danny] Drinkwater," the Italian coach said. 
The main talk in west London over the past few days has been about a striker who will not be available to Conte in a Chelsea shirt again this season. Diego Costa completed his acrimonious departure from Stamford Bridge on Thursday, moving to Atlético Madrid in a deal said to be worth £53 million (about $72 million).

Speaking to reporters on his way to Madrid, Costa said he had "no grudge" toward Conte, and the coach echoed the sentiment. 
"We want to thank him for what he did with this club. We wish him all the best for the future," Conte said. "Don't forget, we won together last season. I repeat: For sure we want to thank him for his effort, not only last season but in the period that he played for Chelsea."
Conte had texted Costa to tell the Spaniard that he was not in his plans for the future at Chelsea, with Álvaro Morata signed from Real Madrid in the summer as Costa's replacement. 


We are into Week 3 of the NFL season, and that means the attrition rate is growing and teams' injury lists are lengthening.
Thursday night’s game between the L.A. Rams and the San Francisco 49ers was pretty brutal, with no fewer than five players going down with concussions. Ahead of Sunday’s (and Monday’s) games, here are the key injury details for each team.
Terrance West, who ran for 80 yards on 19 carries in the Ravens’ Week 1 shutout of the Cincinnati Bengals, has a calf injury and did not appear at practice, according to  CBS.
Cornerback Jalen Ramsey was held out of practice Thursday,  CBS reports. But he played through the same ankle injury last week against the Tennessee Titans.
All-pro linebacker Von Miller injured a knee on a low hit against the Texans last week but participated in practice on Thursday. Bennie Fowler, the wide receiver, is in concussion protocol and out of Sunday’s game.
LeSean McCoy, the running back and centerpiece of the Bills’ offense, has been battling wrist and groin problems over the first two weeks of the season but participated fully in practice on Thursday.
Marshon Lattimore, the 11th overall pick in the 2017 NFL draft, collided with teammate Vonn Bell in the defeat to the New England Patriots last Sunday and remains in concussion protocol. Cornerback Sterling Moore should play after recovering from a chest injury as the Saints’ struggling defense attempts to rebound.
Quarterback Cam Newton did not throw in practice on Thursday, according to  USA Today. Newton was sacked against the Bills on Sunday and hurt a knee in the process.
Ben Roethlisberger is listed on the Steelers’ injury report this week but participated fully in practice on Thursday.
Running back Jordan Howard has been limited in practice this week.  NFL.com says he was limited in practice on Wednesday.
Vic Beasley, the NFL’s sacks leader from last season, is likely to miss a month with a hamstring injury, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports. Beasley was dominant Sunday in the Falcons’ impressive defeat of the Packers.
Ezekiel Ansah, the pro bowl defensive end, was limited in practice on Wednesday with a knee injury, according to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.
Kenny Britt, the wide receiver, is listed on the  Browns’ injury reports this week although he participated fully in practice on Wednesday. Britt has been challenged to produce more by head coach Hue Jackson.
The ailing Colts are still without Andrew Luck, whose shoulder injury again kept him out of practice this week.
The Buccaneers, who look ready to challenge in a crowded NFC South, have no offensive injuries. Gerald McCoy, the brilliant defensive tackle, returned to limited practice on Thursday, according to  CBS. McCoy was seen limping on Wednesday.
Sam Bradford was limited in practice on Thursday, according to  1500ESPN.com. Bradford missed the Vikings’ loss to the Steelers last week with a knee injury.
The Texans’ struggling offense could use a running game. Alfred Blue, who suffered a high-ankle sprain in Houston’s preseason training camp, could return against the Patriots.
The Patriots, already thin at wide receiver, have had Chris Hogan, Rob Gronkowski and Phillip Dorsett listed as “limited in practice” all week.
Running back Jay Ajayi was limited in practice on Wednesday, according to the  Sun-Sentinel. Wide receiver Jarvis Landry is battling a knee injury.
The Jets, who need any scrap of good news they can get, should have Matt Forte available on Sunday. Forte carried nine times for 53 yards against the Raiders.
Odell Beckham Jr., who had four catches for 36 yards on Monday night, has been limited in practice this week but should play against the Eagles, according to  USA Today.
The Eagles’ offense is fine, but they are stretched at safety.  BleedingGreenNation.com reports that Rodney McLeod is not practicing. Nor are his two backups, Corey Graham and Jaylen Watkins, forcing the Eagles to look way down the depth chart in the defensive backfield.
The Seahawks have injuries on both sides of the ball, but those to the malfunctioning offense may be most concerning. Jimmy Graham missed practice on Wednesday with an ankle injury, while Doug Baldwin was absent with a family issue, according to the  Seattle Times.
The Titans’ main offensive concern surrounds DeMarco Murray. Murray injured a hamstring against the Jaguars, but Titans head coach Mike Mularkey is “hopeful” he can start on Sunday, according to  ABC News. If Murray can’t go, the Titans can load more work onto Derrick Henry, who ran impressively last weekend.
The Bengals, who could use a connection that isn’t Andy Dalton throwing to a triple-covered A.J. Green, will likely be without tight end Tyler Eifert, who has  missed two practices with a bad back.
The Packers have Randall Cobb as a doubt for Sunday. Cobb is battling a chest injury, according to CBS, although Aaron Rodgers’s preferred target Jordy Nelson should play.
The 2-0 Chiefs’ main worry is over outside linebacker and premier pass-rusher Justin Houston. Houston missed practice on Thursday with sickness, according to  USA Today. Houston looks like a major factor against the Chargers’ inconsistent offensive line.
Running back Melvin Gordon was limited in practice on Thursday with a knee problem, according to  Yahoo Sports.
Amari Cooper, the standout wide receiver in the Raiders’ high-powered offense, was limited in practice Wednesday but was better Thursday and should play against the Redskins, according to Michael Gehlken of the  Las Vegas Review-Journal.
Jordan Reed, the tight end, is improving from rib and sternum injuries, according to head coach Jay Gruden, who said, “We’ll see how he does tomorrow [Friday].”
The Cowboys are healthy on the offensive side of the ball. Orlando Scandrick, the cornerback, broke his hand against the Giants in the season opener but says he will be ready to go Monday night.
The Cardinals look thin, with linebackers Karlos Dansby and Deone Bucannon listed as limited in practice this week.


When Gordon Hayward was considering whether to make the 2,500-mile move from Utah to Boston, he sought advice from a colleague.
Hayward, who had spent seven years with the Jazz, becoming an all-star last season, was planning his next move. He had a lucrative offer on the table from  the Celtics but wanted to learn more about the team and the city.
The 27-year-old forward turned to  Isaiah Thomas, one of the leading players at the Celtics.  Thomas sold the team to Hayward, and on July 14 Hayward announced he was signing a four-year contract at Boston worth $128 million.
But a little more than a month later, Thomas was gone, traded to  Cleveland as part of a deal that saw  Kyrie Irving join the Celtics. “That was a really strange moment, because I’d really been looking forward to playing with him,”  Hayward wrote on his blog.

“He didn’t just help recruit me to Boston—he was a big piece of that recruitment. He had talked a lot about [the] city and how it was different to be a Celtic. He talked about the intensity of playing in the Eastern Conference Finals, playing at the Garden in the playoffs and how much fun it was, and how much fun he had playing in Boston.
“All of that ultimately helped win me over. And by the time of the trade, I had already started to build a little bit of a relationship with him.”
In what was the most sensational trade of the summer, Hayward will now be playing alongside Irving in the point guard position. Hayward continued: “I have spent enough years in the NBA to realize that things can change like that, in an instant. Still, even though we didn’t necessarily get to be teammates, I’m definitely going to be watching him as a fan.”
But it won’t be long before the two men meet Thomas once again. As fate would have it, the first regular game of the NBA season will see the Celtics travel to Cleveland on October 18 to take on the Cavaliers.

It will take some time for Kevin Durant to live down his recent faux pas on social media. And to some, like ESPN’s Stephen Jackson, the Warriors man may be in danger of being forever remembered for the mishap.
Earlier this week,  Durant was caught defending himself on  Twitter on what was likely intended to be a burner account. A fan had responded to a post from  Durant on Sunday, asking for “one legitimate reason” why the eight-time NBA all-star would leave the Thunder for  the Warriors, a move he made last summer.
Writing in the third person,  Durant responded saying that “he didn’t like the organization or playing for Billy Donovan” and went on to say that “his roster wasn’t that good, it was just him and [Russell] Westbrook.”

Durant, who won the NBA championship in June with  the Warriors, has since apologized for the move, describing it as “childish” and “idiotic.” But Jackson, speaking on ESPN’s The Jump, was critical of the 28-year-old and doesn’t believe the incident will ever be forgotten.

“Kevin Durant,” Jackson said. “I look at you now as I look at everybody else on Twitter and Instagram that has a little egg avatar. You are that person now. You cannot be excluded from that.
“Who creates a fake page? I'm the person, if I want to respond to somebody on social media, it has to come from my page with a verified check on it.”

Speaking on Tuesday at the TechCrunch Disrupt event in San Francisco, Durant apologized for the criticism of Oklahoma. “I don’t regret clapping back at anybody or talking to my fans on Twitter,” he said, as quoted by the  Guardian. “I do regret using my former coach’s name and the former organization I played for. That was childish. That was idiotic, all those type of words. I apologize for that.”
But the damage to Durant’s reputation has been done, and his current team has noticed. According to  The Vertical, officials and players at Golden State have taken note of his “oddball off-season and are perplexed by it.”

Aaron Hernandez, the former New England Patriots tight end who took his own life in jail in April, was suffering from severe brain degeneration when he died.
Hernandez’s family announced the news late Thursday that Hernandez, who was serving a life term without parole for a murder conviction in a Massachusetts jail, had Stage 3 Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy.
The penultimate stage of severity of the brain disease was diagnosed in 99 percent of 111 deceased NFL players in a study conducted by Dr Ann McKee of Boston University and published in July.
McKee also conducted the examination of Hernandez’s brain. A statement from the Concussion Legacy Foundation, which collaborates with Boston University School of Medicine to collect deceased athletes’ brains for study, said Hernandez’s brain was also showing early signs of shrinkage and “large perforations” in a central membrane.
Hernandez, who was 27 when he died in Souza-Baranowski Correctional Facility in Lancaster, Massachusetts, on April 19, was drafted by the Patriots in the fourth round of the 2010 NFL Draft following a career at the University of Florida where he was named an All-American. In a three-year professional career with the Patriots he never made the Pro Bowl but formed a key part of Bill Belichick’s offense alongside Rob Gronkowski.
Hernandez’s later years became marked by violence and crime, however. He was found guilty of the first-degree murder of Odin Lloyd, the boyfriend of the sister of Hernandez’s then-fiancee and later wife Shayanna Jenkins. Hernandez was acquitted of the 2012 double homicide of Daniel de Abreu and Safiro Furtado five days before his suicide.
Jenkins has announced plans to sue the NFL and the Patriots in the wake of Hernandez’s diagnosis on behalf of their daughter, Avielle. A copy of the lawsuit posted by the Boston Herald’s Bob McGovern claims the Patriots and the NFL “failed to disclose, treat or protect” Hernandez from repeated brain injuries.
Jose Baez, Hernandez’s lawyer, told the New York Times on Thursday that Hernandez had “the most severe case [of brain damage] they [McKee’s team] had ever seen in someone of Aaron’s age.”
But Hernandez did not have a public history of diagnosed concussions as an NFL player. A report posted by Boston.com from the Associated Press in April notes he had just one diagnosed concussion in his three seasons that caused him to miss practice the week before the 2011 AFC Championship game against the Baltimore Ravens.
The Patriots won 23-20 with Hernandez playing in the game, catching seven passes and running the ball three times. ‘‘We’re not suggesting anything,’’ Baez said in April when asked if brain damaged had contributed to Hernandez’s suicide. ‘‘You go where the evidence takes you. We need to examine every aspect of this case.’’


Injuries, for athletes, can be some of the darkest and loneliest times of an athletes career.
On Wednesday,  The New York Times published an article following the long recovery of Manchester City’s Ilkay Gundogan, who returned to the football pitch this week after 10 months out with a torn anterior cruciate ligament in his knee.
Gundogan saw his return to fitness as his new job, working hours upon hours until he felt the pain again. “The general feeling,” he said, “is of loneliness.”
Across town at Manchester United, Paul Pogba is set to endure a period on the sidelines after injuring his hamstring a couple of weeks ago in the team’s 3-0 win over FC Basel in the Champions League.
Reports suggested the 24-year-old could be out for between four and 12 weeks, but recent videos of the French midfielder have suggested the former is more likely than the latter.
 
Happiness is always there even injured..yaaaaah @axeltuanzebe_38 your laugh _#manchesterunited #dance
A post shared by Paul Labile Pogba (@paulpogba) on Sep 20, 2017 at 5:07am PDT
 
At this time of the season, with the domestic cup competitions and teams getting into European group stages, it is one of the busiest periods for a club.
Manchester United wants Pogba to return in the best possible form, and according to  The Sun, the club has told him to go on a 10-day vacation before returning to work on his injury.
Pogba had a strong start to the season with a new partner. United had paid Chelsea £40 million (about $54 million) to bring Nemanja Matic to Old Trafford, and his presence is helping Pogba, allowing him to get further upfield.
But now Mourinho will have to make do without him, which he says will be fine. “Squads are for this,” Mourinho said. “Squads are for injuries, squads are for suspensions. So if no Paul for Sunday, we have [Ander] Herrera, we have [Michael] Carrick, we have [Marouane] Fellaini and we have [Nemanja] Matic. We don't cry.”

Manchester United may have begun the new Premier League season at a sprint, but Jose Mourinho clearly believes there’s room for improvement.
In the transfer round-up today,  United is linked with a Brazilian midfielder while rival  Manchester City may no longer be favorites to sign  Alexis Sanchez from Arsenal.
Here,  Newsweek  guides you through all the news and rumors circling the Premier League’s transfer market:
Manchester United has identified Santos’ 27-year-old midfielder  Lucas Lima as a potential target for when the transfer window reopens in January, according to  TalkSport. The Brazilian is out of contract at the start of next year, and  Mourinho sees him as a possible replacement for Michael Carrick, who is expected to retire.
Across town, Manchester City has had a blow to its hopes of signing  Alexis Sanchez from Arsenal as  Pep Guardiola’s club believes Paris Saint-Germain is now favorites,  The Sun says. City looked set to sign the Chilean forward on transfer deadline day but the move fell through, and now it fears PSG will offer the £400,000-a-week wages Sanchez wanted from Arsenal.

Juventus chairman Beppe Marotta has revealed that his club would be powerless should Barcelona look to sign forward  Paulo Dybala, according to  The Sun. The 23-year-old has stood out as the team’s star player over the past two seasons. Liverpool, however, would argue that Barcelona can be resisted after Philippe Coutinho was prevented from joining from Liverpool this summer.
Liverpool signed Naby Keita from RB Leipzig in the summer for a club-record fee, set to join up with the team next summer, but Jurgen Klopp also wants one of his teammates. According to  Bild, Liverpool is planning to make a move for Leipzig’s 18-year-old center back  Dayot Upamecano .
And finally, after chasing Antoine Griezmann for the early stages of this summer, Jose Mourinho now even looks unlikely to get the French forward next year. According to  The Mirror, the 26-year-old has decided to stay with Atletico Madrid. On Thursday, he welcomed the arrival of former Chelsea striker Diego Costa, who was expected to be a replacement for Griezmann.


Another week of Thursday Night Football, another absolutely atrocious game for degenerate NFL fans to convince themselves they enjoy sitting through. Last week, it was a 13-9 barn-burner between the Texans and the Bengals, a team that has yet to score a touchdown in 2017. This week, it's the 49ers, who lost a similarly thrilling Week 2 game to the Seahawks 12-9, and the Rams, who are still the Rams.

This season's uninspiring slate of Thursday Night Football games—minus the opener between the Patriots and Chiefs—is not unusual. It's a time-honored tradition for the NFL to bequeath to its own network the week's least intriguing game (or at least one of the least intriguing games—there are plenty to go around).
But things could be looking up for midweek NFL entertainment. The rest of the 2017 slate of games features a three-week stretch of the Patriots traveling to Tampa to play the upstart Buccaneers, the Eagles playing the Panthers in North Carolina and the Chiefs playing the Raiders in Oakland, which could be one of the best games of the early season. The schedule kind of goes downhill after that, minus an intriguing matchup between the Titans and the Steelers in Pittsburgh in Week 11.
The schedule leaves something to be desired, but it's not the only problem. Teams playing on Thursday night have three days less to prepare than they would if they were playing on Sunday, and, more important, three days less to recover physically. The 49ers on Sunday endured a knock-down, drag-out defensive battle within the home stadium of one of the toughest teams in the league. It was one of the later games on Sunday too. They can't be expected to be at their peak on such short rest. Neither can any team that played 60 minutes of football four days earlier.
The result is sloppy football, and when that sloppy football is being played by teams that aren't very good anyway, it can be excruciating to watch. Ask anyone who tuned in to watch the Texans and Bengals last week.
If this Thursday night you are indeed bored enough to strap in and watch the Rams gut it out against the 49ers at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California, the game will start at 8:25 p.m. ET, or 5:25 p.m. if you're on the West Coast. It will be broadcast live on the NFL Network and available to stream on NFL Mobile from Verizon. Next week's game between the Packers and Bears will be the first of 10 Thursday night games available to stream on Amazon Prime Video.
An added reason to watch this week, we guess, is that the Rams and 49ers will be wearing their Color Rush jerseys. Check them out.


Though the uniforms are cool, staring at those bold colors bouncing around in HD for three hours isn't easy on the eyes. Hopefully, the same won't be said for the actual game.


The Brooklyn Nets lost more games than any other NBA team in the 2016-17 season—and the Cleveland Cavaliers need them to be just as bad this year if LeBron James is going to stay in northeast Ohio.
A report from the New York Times claims James is “increasingly restless” at the Cavaliers, although he could yet be persuaded to stay if Koby Altman can revamp a team that has lost an All-Star point guard in Kyrie Irving and gained one in Isaiah Thomas from the Boston Celtics.
A key part of that deal, of course, was the Nets’ 2018 first-round draft pick that the Celtics acquired in 2013 in the trade that sent Paul Pierce and Kevin Garnett to New York.
The Times notes how a confluence of factors could lead to James’ inevitable departure from Cleveland, for a second time—or how circumstances could fall into place for the Cavaliers so that remaining with his hometown team is left as the only, logical, option.
Isaiah Thomas could perform like he doesn’t have a troubling, troublesome hip injury. Russell Westbrook and Paul George could decide they like the quietude of the Midwest over the neon glare of Los Angeles.
Most importantly, the Nets could once again finish stuck fast to the bottom of the Eastern Conference, losing 60-plus games again and sending the first or second pick in the 2018 NBA Draft to the Cavaliers.
If all of that happens, then the fantastical, purported Los Angeles Lakers team of James, Westbrook, George and Lonzo Ball directing them from the point would appear dead in the water.
Then, James gets a rejuvenated Thomas and an elite prospect to nurse through the juvenile stages of his professional career. James could be the big brother that he was to Kyrie Irving, and see out the end of his career where his emotional attachment will always be strongest.
The NBA’s worst team from last season could certainly help the Cavaliers out by being equally terrible in 2017.


Amid legal wrangles and existential concerns over the future of American football, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell continues to earn a fat wad of cash.
ESPN reports that Goodell, who took over as commissioner from Paul Tagliabue in 2006, should finalize the details of a contract extension in the next few days or weeks after a meeting with the NFL’s “compensation committee” on Wednesday that consists of six franchise owners.
"It's done from ownership perspective," ESPN quoted an unnamed source as saying. Goodell’s current contract, which paid him $32 million in 2015, the last year his salary was disclosed, ends in 2019.
Perhaps more intriguing than Goodell’s salary—$32 million earned in 2015 is more than Matthew Stafford, the NFL’s highest-paid player ever, will earn on average for the next five years of his contract—is the reaction of certain NFL owners to the news. The report claims Jerry Jones, the owner of the Dallas Cowboys, “raised issues” about Goodell’s new deal. Jones, it is claimed, thinks Goodell makes “way too much money.”
Under Goodell the NFL has set itself ambitious revenue targets. The league expects to make $14 billion in 2017 while Goodell has set a target of $25 billion in annual revenue by 2025.
Against that financial growth—the NFL generated $8 billion annually as recently as 2010—Goodell has faced controversies on his watch, including the handling of former Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice’s domestic violence case. In an August 2014 letter to NFL owners, Goodell apologized to NFL owners for only giving Rice an initial two-game suspension. After video emerged of Rice knocking out his then fiancée in an elevator Goodell extended the ban indefinitely, only for that decision to be overturned in court.
Goodell remains unpopular in New England for the “deflategate” saga, which resulted in a four-game suspension for Tom Brady at the start of the 2016-2017 season. Goodell’s tenure has also been marked by the NFL’s public-relations struggle around brain injuries and their aftereffects. The NFL is currently engaged in a high-profile legal battle surrounding the domestic violence case of Ezekiel Elliott, the Dallas Cowboys running back.
As the highest-profile face of the business side of the NFL, Goodell has taken considerable buckshot. But he survives and prospers because the NFL’s business is, on the bottom line, booming. That looks likely to win him more years in the league’s top job.


It is a little over a year now since Kobe Bryant called it a day and, after five NBA titles, retired from basketball. But the Lakers are still in a state of both celebration and mourning.
He spent his entire career, 20 years, playing for  the Lakers and the team has made it clear that it wants to thank him for his service and make sure he’s remembered in the sport.
Earlier this month,  the Lakers announced that they would be retiring not one but two jerseys, worn by Bryant—he wore numbers 8 and 24—during his time playing at the Staples Center. He becomes the 10th Lakers player to have his shirt retired, but the first to have two.
“As a kid growing up in Italy, I always dreamed of my jersey hanging in  the Lakers rafters, but I certainly never imagined two of them,”  Bryant said. But team president Jeanie Buss doesn’t believe any player would want to go near those numbers given the success of Bryant.
“My feeling is that even if we just retired one number, no one’s ever gonna wear the other, so you may as well retire… no one’s ever gonna wear 8 or 24 for the Lakers ever again,” she said, as quoted by  SB Nation.

Buss and  the Lakers aren’t stopping there, though. There are possible plans, she suggested, that the Staples Center may see a statue of the 18-time All-Star outside it at some point in the future.
She added: “It just worked out that that was the right date to do it, and I think we’ll have a great celebration, and certainly someday there will be a statue as well.”
Bryant, now 39, helped guide the Lakers to five NBA Championships—in 2000, 2001, 2002, 2009 and 2010—and was voted MVP in 2008.
“Kobe was one of the greatest Lakers and NBA players of all-time and he’s definitely on my Mount Rushmore,” said Magic Johnson, director of operations at the Lakers.
“I look forward to seeing both of his jerseys be retired and celebrating this special day with Kobe and his family.”
The Lakers, meanwhile, are busy planning for the future. LeBron James, whose status in the sport is equal to Bryant’s, is the main target for Johnson and the team as he can opt-out of his contract at Cleveland next summer.
The idea of a move to Los Angeles has been backed up. In June,  The Ringer's Kevin O'Connor reported that James looked set for a move to L.A., but whether that was to join the Lakers or the Clippers was uncertain. This was echoed by  Yahoo's Adrian Wojnarowski, who claimed that James's championship win in 2016 "liberated" him to leave Cleveland once again.


Kevin Durant got his wish: He moved from Oklahoma City last summer to Golden State last summer in order to win the NBA championship—it took less than a year to achieve that.
Now,  the Warriors look like they have the potential to go on and dominate for years to come, but  Durant could be in danger of sabotaging himself. The latest incident has reportedly harmed his reputation among the team.
Durant was caught out, red-handed, defending himself on social media from what was likely intended to be a burner account. On Sunday, a fan responded to a post from the eight-times NBA all-star asking for “one legitimate reason” why  Durant would leave the Thunder for the Warriors.
Durant responded, writing in the third person, saying that “he didn’t like the organization or playing for Billy Donovan” and went on to say that “his roster wasn’t that good, it was just him and [Russell] Westbrook.”

Users of the social media site were quick to notice that the comments had come from the 28-year-old’s official, verified account. On Tuesday, speaking at the TechCrunch Disrupt event in San Francisco, Durant apologized for his actions.

“I don’t regret clapping back at anybody or talking to my fans on Twitter,” the 28-year-old said, as quoted by the  Guardian.
“I do regret using my former coach’s name and the former organization I played for. That was childish. That was idiotic, all those type of words. I apologize for that.”
But the damage to Durant’s reputation has been done, and his current team has noticed.
According to  The Vertical: “Many in Golden State, team officials and players alike, have taken note of Durant’s oddball offseason and are perplexed by it. They see a bright future for Durant in Oakland, league and team sources told The Vertical, and are bewildered as to why he is still addressing his past.”
Related:   Why is Kevin Durant So Angry At The Moment?
He is far from afraid of engaging with fans. Durant’s even got involved in ESPN’s ranking of NBA stars, agreeing with Chris Brickley’s suggestion that placing Carmelo Anthony at 64th in the list was purposely controversial to gain clicks. “Death to espn lol,” Durant commented.
He won’t, however, be disappearing from social media. “I don’t think I’ll stop engaging with fans,” he said. “I really enjoy it and it’s a good way to connect us all, but I’ll scale back a little bit right now and just focus on playing basketball.”

Having the NBA’s best all-round player on your team apparently provides no guarantee of financial success, as the Cleveland Cavaliers are finding out.
A report by ESPN shows 14 NBA franchises lost money in the 2016-17 season. Nine of those teams made losses even after revenue-sharing was taken into account.
Those teams include the Cavaliers, who reached the NBA Finals for the second year in a row in June, losing to the Golden State Warriors. The Cavaliers made a net loss after revenue-sharing and the luxury tax were factored in.
That almost half of the league’s teams are loss-making even in the wake of a new $24 billion television deal presents a headache to the NBA as it attempts to balance the desire for parity and the development of smaller-market teams with the league’s behemoths. ESPN notes that smaller-market teams like the Memphis Grizzlies (and the Cavaliers) are struggling to keep up with a rising salary cap because their local television deals are worth far less than the bigger-market franchises.
The report also highlights how financial success in the NBA often fails to correlate with on-court performances. The Los Angeles Lakers finished next-to-bottom of the NBA’s Western Conference in 2016-17 but made a profit of $115 million even after they shared out $49 million to the rest of the league. The Grizzlies, meanwhile, took around $140 million less in local television rights than the Lakers. Four teams, the Warriors, Lakers, Chicago Bulls and New York Knicks, doled out 71.9 percent of the league’s revenue-sharing payments. Only the Warriors, the eventual NBA champions, and the Bulls made the playoffs.
The NBA’s owners are going to review the league’s revenue-sharing agreement at a Board of Governors meeting in New York from September 27-28, according to ESPN. There are arguments on both sides. As the salary cap rises, so smaller-market teams need a larger slice of revenue-sharing in order to stay financially viable. But the Lakers and their counterparts in the United States’ biggest television markets will continue to bristle at sharing the benefits of their popularity with teams who then make the playoffs ahead of them. The NBA’s business continues to boom—but that doesn’t mean there aren’t bumps along the way.


Jurgen Klopp declared himself “sick” after Leicester City rode its luck and displayed some profligate finishing to beat Liverpool in the League Cup third round on Tuesday evening at the King Power Stadium.
Liverpool has now failed to win their last four games and the visceral hammering of Arsenal at Anfield back in August seems a long time ago now. Here are some of the problems with Klopp’s team.
A recurring theme under Klopp—Liverpool is sparkling in attack and holey like a Swiss cheese in defense. Once Leicester warmed to its task in the second half, it found it far too easy to cut through Liverpool.
And this, remember, is a team 15th in the Premier League averaging less than a point a game. There was little anyone could have done about Islam Slimani’s thunderous goal that made it 2-0 to Leicester, but the reactions for Shinji Okazaki’s strike that opened the scoring were far too slow.
When Liverpool is on top in games, as it was in the first half at the King Power Stadium, then Jordan Henderson looks a perfectly capable, even excellent, central midfielder.
Henderson regularly fails to convince, though, when Liverpool comes under pressure. In the second half, when he should have been leading the inexperienced Marko Grujic through the game, the former Sunderland man began to misplace passes. By the end of the game Liverpool was regularly inviting attacks on those nervous central defenders. Conceding goals regularly is rarely just the defense’s fault.
Liverpool spent £35 million on Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain from Arsenal. Oxlade-Chamberlain, the boyfriend of someone from the pop band ‘Little Mix,’ came to Liverpool to play in central midfield, rejecting Chelsea in the process.
At the moment, the pricey experiment is yet to work out for either party. On his first start for Liverpool Oxlade-Chamberlain was occasionally promising, more often clumsy especially in the second half as his team was pushed back towards its own goal. It is more than slightly dizzying to consider that Mohamed Salah, Liverpool’s other expensive summer signing, cost the same amount of money as Oxlade-Chamberlain. Salah looks more than worth the money; “The Ox,” as of yet, does not.
This comes heavily prefaced with the caveat that neither Roberto Firmino, Sadio Mane nor Salah, Liverpool’s first-choice attacking trident, played against Leicester. Even so, it was impossible not to notice the contrast between Liverpool’s performance in the first half when Coutinho was on the pitch and the second, when he was withdrawn for the prodigal teenager Ben Woodburn. Liverpool is a better team when Coutinho prods and prompts; for its supporters, the prospect of his seemingly inevitable departure must be a terrifying one.
Against Burnley at the weekend, Liverpool took 35 shots and scored only once. Against Leicester, it had 21 but just three were on target and it was held off the scoresheet. It is becoming as much of a problem as the defense that Liverpool will regularly dominate teams in terms of possession and chances, yet just as regularly fail to kill the game off.
Daniel Sturridge played against Burnley but he looks a shadow of the player who was so successful alongside Luis Suarez under Brendan Rodgers. Liverpool can be thrilling to watch but that will be remembered less than their ability to put their many chances away.


Jack Wilshere is looking to move to London rivals West Ham in January after Arsenal showed little interest in extending his contract when it expires at the end of the season, according to reports.
Wilshere, whose career has been plagued by injuries, spent last season on loan with Eddie Howe’s Bournemouth after  Arsene Wenger made it clear he wasn’t a first choice at  Arsenal.
The 25-year-old is back in north London this season but has played just 22 minutes so far, coming off the bench in a 3-1 win over Cologne in the Europa League group stage.
Wilshere was linked with a move to  West Ham over the summer but now the English midfielder is looking to make that move go through in January, according to the  Daily Star.
The Hammers had been reportedly put off from buying Wilshere last month after being given a valuation of £20 million (about $27 million) for the midfielder.
Related:   Why is Jose Mourinho in Danger of Doing an Arsene Wenger at Manchester United?
Wenger, however, has suggested Wilshere does have a future at the Emirates Stadium, challenging him to prove his fitness the season to earn a new contract.
“It’s a dream for all of us,” Wenger said, as quoted by  The Daily Telegraph. “I gave Jack his start at 17 years of age. You have to be convinced to play a boy at 17 that he is a special player. He is a special player, but we are all the same in that you need health to work.”
Wenger’s team faces Doncaster in the League Cup on Wednesday night, with Wilshere expected to be given an opportunity to prove himself in a weakened Arsenal XI.
In the Premier League, however, Wenger will need his best team out as the Gunners look to climb up from 12th in the table. Two defeats, to Stoke and then Liverpool, have left Wenger’s team six points behind leaders Manchester City and Manchester United.


Manchester United will battle Manchester City for the signing of Arsenal forward Alexis Sanchez who can leave on a free next summer, according to reports.
Sanchez, the Chilean forward, looked set to join  Pep Guardiola’s City on the final day of the transfer window in August, after a reported £80 million (about $108 million) bid.
But  Arsene Wenger resisted selling, meaning Sanchez is free to talk to any club he wishes in January and make a pre-contract agreement for the summer.
That looked set to be City, but  Jose Mourinho has thrown a spanner into the works by entering  United into the race for the 28-year-old, according to  The Sun.
Sanchez has made just one start in the Premier League this season, and scored his first goal of the campaign in a 3-1 win over Cologne in the Europa League last week.
Related:   Why is Jose Mourinho in Danger of Doing an Arsene Wenger at Manchester United?
While Arsenal sit 12th in the table after five games, Sanchez’s two potential suitors are level on points and goal difference at the top of the league. City leads only due to the fact that teams are listed in alphabetical order.
Guardiola’s men, even without Sanchez, have torn past teams at the start of this season, scoring 15 goals and conceding zero in the last three games, including a 5-0 win against Liverpool.
Manchester United’s football has not been quite as aesthetically pleasing, but  Mourinho’s team has succeeded in grinding down teams and then trampling over them. Twice, against Swansea and Everton on Sunday, United has not played particularly well but come out on the right end of a 4-0 result.
Sanchez only has to wait four months to know where he’ll be playing his football next season, and with two good choices, Mourinho has given him a nice problem to have.


Home run number 55 was one of those shots that only Giancarlo Stanton, maybe, in the whole of professional baseball can hit. In the bottom of the fourth inning, not an arcing moonshot to left field but a viciously cracked laser beam that hardly seemed to leave the ground and yet traveled 455 feet, straight, to the right of that weird tropical structure as the viewer saw it on television.
That it would be a homer was never in doubt from the moment the ball left Stanton’s bat at the bottom of the fourth inning at Marlins Park, the knockout artist formerly known as "Mike" cracking open what had been a tight game on the way to a 13-1 win over the tailspinning New York Mets.
Stanton is hitting with the certainty of a man closing in on a record. Only five players have ever hit the 60-home-run mark in a single season: Babe Ruth in 1927, Roger Maris in 1961, Sammy Sosa, Mark McGwire and Barry Bonds.

Sosa did it three times, the first in 1998 when McGwire cracked 70, beaten only by Bonds three years later. Already, through 150 games Stanton stands at 19th on the all-time list and yet Bonds’s 73 is out of reach even in this jaw-loosening season.
Each mighty swing carries with it a physical sureness, yes, and questions trailing in the vacuum behind. The seemingly unreachable marks of McGwire and Bonds stand, officially, as do Sosa’s 60-plus seasons. Each has been tarnished. McGwire admitted to steroid use, Sosa allegedly tested positive for steroids in 2003 although he has always denied using PEDs, and Bonds became tangled up in the Balco scandal tightly enough that he still awaits entry into Cooperstown and the Hall of Fame.
“You’re never going to see that again in your life…never,” Sosa said in January of this year, as quoted by Sporting News. “You’re never going to see the show Mark and I put on…never. You’re not going to see that excitement again. We were the ones bringing more fans to the stadium.… I feel proud of what I did. The only thing is, they can say whatever they want to say about me. First of all, I’m clean. They don’t have a case on me. I never failed a drug test. Never in my life.”
Sosa is right, even in a season of unprecedented consistency in home-run hitting across the league. Behind Stanton only Judge, on 44, and the Arizona Diamondbacks’ J.D. Martinez have passed 40 this season. Which leaves more questions swirling around Marlins Park with the fast-food wrappers, around the seats dented by Stanton’s exocets. “We’ve had that talk a couple of times: Which one? What do they mean individually?” The Marlins’ Christian Yelich said last week in quotes reported by The New York Times of discussions with Stanton about which mark he is really chasing. “We were both like, ‘I don’t know.’’’
Where does Stanton stand, when he’s not threatening the roof of Marlins Park? “Considering some things, I do,’’ he said in August when asked whether he considered Maris’s 61 home runs as the true single-season record.
Each blow from now on brings him closer to that mark, answering a question of himself and posing an existential one to baseball. The Marlins’ muscled superhero is showing the gossamer uncertainty of MLB’s recent past.


Someone may need to tell Magic Johnson that secret weapons lose effectiveness when you name them on national television. That was what the Lakers president of basketball operations did earlier this week on ESPN.
Despite how effusive he has been about the newly drafted Lonzo Ball,  Johnson wasn’t referring to the 19-year-old point guard when he described a Lakers player as having the same “basketball IQ” as him. No, Johnson told First Take that he believed it would be Larry Nance Jr. who would be a key figure for  the Lakers this coming season.
“Our secret weapon is Larry Nance,” Johnson said. “We’ve gotten calls from a lot of teams wanting to trade for him and Brandon Ingram and we’ve said no. Larry is such a fundamentally sound basketball player.”
Nance, the 24-year-old forward, has averaged 6.3 points and 5.4 rebounds in his first couple of seasons with  the Lakers. Yet Johnson must be expecting those numbers to increase significantly this coming season, which begins on October 1 with the Timberwolves traveling to California.

There may, however, be another reason that Nance could play a key role in the Lakers season, and that is due to the fact the team has less than 12 months to tempt  LeBron James to join. The  Cavs man can opt out of his contract at Cleveland at the end of the season, with Los Angeles a possible destination.
Los Angeles appears to be making itself appear as attractive as possible, given the fact that it is signing former Cavaliers center Andrew Bogut on a one-year deal, according to  ESPN. Nance may also play a role in luring LeBron considering both come from Akron, Ohio, though it's difficult to ascertain how much pull that might have.
It seems increasingly likely that James will not be playing in Cleveland come next summer, with Los Angeles as a possible destination. This theory was reported by  The Ringer’s Kevin O’Connor in June, and echoed by  Yahoo’s Adrian Wojnarowski earlier this summer, both saying James would end up in L.A. with either the Lakers or the Clippers.  Peter Vecsey, the Bleacher Report columnist, went one step further this week to say the decision had already been made and he was going to the Lakers.
At least, with Nance and Bogut, he would have something in common with his new teammates.


Eden Hazard has praised the work of Antonio Conte, Jose Mourinho’s successor at Chelsea, claiming that he improved him in just a week.
Hazard won the Premier League with both  Mourinho and Conte, in 2015 and 2017, respectively, as well as being named PFA Player of the Year and runner-up.
Conte, the former Juventus and Italy national team coach, took over from  Mourinho last summer, winning the title in his first year at Stamford Bridge, and Hazard says his impact was immediate.
“Even after a week I think I had progressed with him,” the 26-year-old Belgian said, as quoted by the  Daily Mail.
“I think he's shown not just at Chelsea but also at Juve that he's a good coach and I think he has some good years ahead of him.”
Related:   Why is Jose Mourinho in Danger of Doing an Arsene Wenger at Manchester United?
Conte is in his second season as Chelsea manager despite speculation over the summer that the 48-year-old Italian was close to leaving Stamford Bridge.
After returning the west London club to the Champions League, Conte is now aiming to take the club to its third European trophy in six years, after Chelsea won the Champions League in 2012 and Europa League in 2013.
“There's a lot of tactics,” Hazard said of training with Conte. “It's not always nice as a forward as you have to run, defend and everything, but at least at the weekend, you know exactly what to do, you can even close your eyes and play. That's good.”
Mourinho, meanwhile, is now manager at  Manchester United, tasked with bringing back the Premier League trophy, a title he has won three times, back to Old Trafford.
His team is currently second in the Premier League table, to rival Manchester City, but only alphabetically;  United has the same points and goal difference as Pep Guardiola’s City after five games.


When Pep Guardiola, one of soccer’s most coveted managers, signed as coach of English club Manchester City in January 2016, the deal had been a work in progress for four years. City had built a foundation that would make the Etihad Stadium an attractive prospect for Guardiola.
Other than the material attraction of the club, a 55,000-seater stadium and state-of-the-art academy,  City’s strongest offensive to lure  Guardiola was through recruitment. In 2012, the club made Ferran Soriano its CEO and Txiki Begiristain its director of football; both had worked with Guardiola at Barcelona, as vice president  and technical director, respectively.
City transformed itself from alien to familiar for Guardiola, and that may well be the approach the  Lakers are looking to take as  L.A. also tries to pull off one of the most sensational signings in sports.
LeBron James, the four-time MVP with three rings, has a decision to make. Next summer, the 32-year-old has the opportunity to opt out of his contract with the Cleveland Cavaliers, the team he won the championship with in 2016, and the team he also left in 2010 for the Miami Heat.

But that departure worked out for James. In four years in Florida, he enjoyed the most prosperous years of his career, winning back-to-back NBA titles and three of his four MVP awards.
It seems, increasingly, that James will not be playing in Cleveland come next summer, and heading for Los Angeles instead. This theory was reported by  The Ringer’s Kevin O’Connor in June, and echoed by  Yahoo’s Adrian Wojnarowski earlier this summer, both saying James would end up in L.A. with either the Lakers or the Clippers.  Peter Vecsey, the Bleacher Report columnist, went one step further this week to say the decision had already been made and he was going to the Lakers.
The Lakers, like Manchester City, look like they’re trying to make Los Angeles seem as familiar as possible for James. According to  ESPN, they have even begun to sign his former teammates, taking center Andrew Bogut on a one-year deal.
Fortunately for the Lakers, L.A. is already home for James. He owns a house in Brentwood, and reports last week even suggested he and wife Savannah had  spent time scouting schools in the area for their 12-year-old son Bronny.
But will the Lakers, like Manchester City, get their man? Time, as they say, will tell.


In his first major interview since the blockbuster trade that took him from the Cleveland Cavaliers to the Boston Celtics, Kyrie Irving veered between succinct and testy.
Irving, the point guard who in conjunction with LeBron James took the Cavaliers to the first NBA Championship in their history in 2016, sat down for an hour with ESPN First Take’s Max Kellerman, Molly Qerim and Stephen A. Smith to discuss why he pushed for a move away from northeast Ohio.
Irving was careful to avoid direct criticism of either the Cavaliers coaching staff or James in the interview, although some of his words could certainly be interpreted that way. Asked about the factors that provoked his decision to ask for a trade, Irving said: “As a 25-year-old evolving man, coming in to perfect my craft every single day, I just wanted to be in an environment where I felt I could be taught every single day and have that demand from my coaching staff and have that demand from a franchise that would propel me to exceed my potential and see how far I can go.” As ESPN noted in its own analysis of the interview, that sounded like something of a shot at Tyronn Lue, the Cavaliers’ head coach.
Of course, most of the casual interest in the interview surrounded Irving’s relationship with James, the “big brother” who took Irving under his wing after the Duke graduate was drafted first overall in 2011.
Irving deferred on a definitive answer as to whether his trade that sent Isaiah Thomas to the Cavaliers in return was motivated by a desire to get away from James’s shadow, as had been widely reported. And he offered the shortest of answers when asked if he had spoken to James prior to demanding the trade. “No,” Irving said. “Why would I have to?”
Pressed repeatedly on the status of his friendship with James, Irving finally snapped. “Why does it continually have to be about one player? Do you realize I play with 13 other guys on the team?”
Irving sounded most hurt when talking about the way that the news of the trade leaked out in late July. Smith was the journalist who claimed back then that Irving believed James’s camp had leaked the news of his desire to leave the Cavaliers.
“I think that how ironic it was that I was on my China trip and my trade request all of sudden just came out publicly. It was hurtful, because I knew how professional I had kept it throughout the whole entire process. And how strategic it was, because I knew that it was going to be madness, and it turned out to be like that.”
It’s all a pretty compelling prelude to the first time Irving and James meet as opponents on the court, on opening night of the 2017-18 NBA season at Quicken Loans Arena on October 17.


On the pitch, Romelu Lukaku has made a rapid start to his Manchester United career.
Off it, the Belgium striker is causing controversy through no fault of his own.
To accompany their new forward’s goalscoring feats, a section of United’s support has started up a chant referring to Lukaku’s penis, to the tune of a song by English 1980s rock band The Stone Roses' called ‘Made of Stone.’ (United, it should be pointed out tangentially, walks out onto the Old Trafford pitch to another Stone Roses song, ‘This Is The One.’)
“Romelu Lukaku, he’s our Belgian scoring genius with a 24-inch penis, scoring all our goals, bellend by his toes,” the song goes.
A piece posted Monday on the well-known United blog, Republik of Mancunia, called the chant “drivel that belongs in the 1980s” and now The Independent reports that United will “seek advice” over the chant after being contacted by anti-racism organization Kick It Out.
“Kick It Out is aware of footage of alleged racist chanting by supporters of Manchester United that emerged on Wednesday evening [September 13],” a Kick It Out statement reported by The Independent read.
“The lyrics used in the chant are offensive and discriminatory. Racist stereotypes are never acceptable in football or wider society, irrespective of any intention to show support for a player.
“We have contacted Manchester United regarding the issue and will be working closely with them and the FA to ensure that it is addressed swiftly. If we receive any reports relating to the discriminatory chant, those will be passed on to the governing body and the perpetrators can expect to face punishment.”
The specter of supposedly “ironic” derogatory chanting by Premier League supporters has already raised its head earlier this month, when Chelsea condemned as “unacceptable” anti-Semitic chants from its supporters during the victory against Leicester at the King Power Stadium, aimed at the large Jewish fanbase of rival club Tottenham Hotspur. Alvaro Morata, the unwitting Chelsea striker around whom the chant revolved, appealed for “respect for everyone” in the wake of the incident.


Look, no one wants to tank, just like no one wants to have a troublesome tooth removed. Just like no one wants to cut ties with or demote a multiple Super Bowl-winning quarterback.
But when your team is lumbering as badly as the New York Giants, there may not be many better choices.
The Giants were horrible again under the spotlight on Monday night, falling to 0-2 against an intermittently brilliant but flawed Detroit Lions team.
Even the Detroit Free Press tempered its enthusiasm for the Lions’ 24-10 victory by noting that the Giants were “terrible,” pointing out New York’s preponderance for “stupid penalties” on both sides of the ball.
The Giants’ problems probably don’t start or end with Eli Manning, the 36-year-old quarterback who led both of those improbable Super Bowl runs in the last decade. Manning, who has never been a running quarterback, must work behind an offensive line that gave up three sacks on Monday to Ziggy Ansah alone. Although Brandon Marshall was added to the Giants’ offense this year—the Pro Bowl wide receiver had a disappointing evening against the Lions—Odell Beckham is yet to get up to full speed after an ankle sprain. The Giants have no running game to speak of. Manning is working, metaphorically, on one leg.
And yet…there is rarely room for nostalgia in the NFL, at least before a player has long since retired. Even Tom Brady is going to find that out. Manning wasn’t good on Monday despite completing 22 of 32 passes for 239 yards with a touchdown and an interception. “No part of the offense was functional,” head coach Ben McAdoo said in quotes reported by ESPN.
That includes the signal-caller. ESPN quotes an unnamed NFL executive as saying Manning’s age, coupled with his lack of protection, is beginning to count against him. “Combination of age and questionable offensive line isn’t a favorable pairing for Eli,” the executive said. “No one seems to think of their [quarterback] situation as a potential weakness. I do.”
Manning is signed through 2019, and the Giants did draft a quarterback in the spring in Davis Webb, a third-rounder out of Texas Tech. Manning, who says he wants to play into his 40s, almost certainly isn’t going anywhere while Webb develops.
But the 2018 NFL Draft looks like a special year for quarterbacks, with USC’s Sam Darnold the biggest prize for the league’s biggest loser. Behind Darnold there are other potential NFL starters waiting. Manning isn’t the problem, and a more measured option may be to use the draft to get Manning some premium-quality help on the offensive line. But the pot of gold lying at the end of the rainbow for any team willing to be truly awful this season means he may be one of the easier problems for the Giants to solve.


The list of criticisms provided by some quarters at the Emirates Stadium would be long: Stubborn, lacking dynamism, too purist, failure to think forward. These are some of the accusations made against Arsene Wenger, Arsenal manager for 21 years, made famous by Arsenal Fan TV.
The latest grumble that has rumbled on in north London over their manager is the gamble  Wenger and the board have taken over player contracts;  Arsenal, somehow, allowed a string of first-team players to reach the final year of their deals, leaving the club vulnerable to their departing next summer for nothing.
On transfer deadline day, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain moved to rival club Liverpool for £35 million (about $47 million); Alexis Sanchez came close to switching to Manchester City; Mesut Ozil’s future at the club was never certain. Arsenal was forced into a corner by its failure to get key players to sign contracts earlier.
And here’s where  Jose Mourinho comes in. The prospect of  Mourinho being compared to Wenger is almost unthinkable; purist vs. pragmatist, they differ in so many ways. But  Mourinho may have found himself in a similar position to Wenger, because the Manchester United manager has at least seven first-team players in the final year of their contracts.

According to  Sports Mole, Juan Mata, Daley Blind, Ander Herrera, Marouane Fellaini, Luke Shaw, Michael Carrick and Ashley Young are all in the last year of their deals at Old Trafford. Come January, each player, worth a combined £100 million and, possibly, more, could make a pre-contract agreement with another team and leave for free next summer.
Turning 37 next year, Carrick, the club captain who is yet to feature this season, is likely to retire from football at the end of this campaign. But Mourinho has relied heavily on Fellaini, Mata, Herrera and Blind this season, who have made a total of 23 appearances in the first team between them in United’s first seven games of the season.
United, the  Daily Mail says, has fallen short of Fellaini’s hopes with its latest deal to the Belgian midfielder. But Fellaini is turning 30 in November and United’s policy is to give one-year rolling contracts to players aged 30 and above.
Ed Woodward, Manchester United’s executive vice-chairman, will have to resolve the situation over the next few months or feel the wrath of Mourinho. The Portuguese coach won’t take kindly to being compared to Wenger.


Marouane Fellaini is yet to accept Manchester United’s offer of a new contract and could leave Old Trafford for free next summer, according to reports.
The Belgium midfielder has become a key figure for  Jose Mourinho since the Portuguese coach took over from Louis van Gaal last summer, with Fellaini featuring in all  United’s games so far this season.
According to the  Daily Mail, United’s latest offer to the 29-year-old midfielder has not met his expectations. Fellaini turns 30 in November and the club’s policy has been to offer one-year rolling contracts to players aged 30 and above.
Mourinho, however, will want to make sure the Belgian remains in his squad. Earlier this month the United boss said: “I always thought that he was a player with special qualities and players with special qualities are players with a place in your team or in your squad.

“I knew he was a player with a lot to give, but I think the relation between the players and the managers are very important in their performance levels, confidence levels and self-esteem levels.”
Fellaini joined United in 2013, brought to Old Trafford from Everton by his former coach David Moyes who was sacked after less than a year in the job.
Despite many fans believing the midfielder’s style didn’t fit in at United, Fellaini remained under Van Gaal and is flourishing with Mourinho, becoming a key figure in his squad.
Top of the Premier League, United travels to Southampton on Saturday as it looks to keep up with rival  Manchester City, which is level on points and goal difference.
First, though, United hosts Championship club Burton Albion at Old Trafford on Wednesday in the League Cup.


Just about two weeks through the 2017 NFL season, we can see pretty clear divisions between who’s the class in both conferences. It’s also a strong enough sample size to really break down who’s a surefire bet for FanDuel, DraftKings and other daily fantasy lineups.
Thus far, very little has changed compared to last season and who DFS owners can trust on a week-to-week basis.
We waited a couple weeks for the divisions to form and it should be worth the wait since it allowed us to assess who is falling and who’s on the rise. How many of us really thought Bengals quarterback Andy Dalton would collapse and turn top DFS weapons like receiver A.J. Green and tight end Tyler Eifert into wasted salary cap? That’s something we wouldn’t have known prior to Weeks 1 and 2.
Or what if Chiefs' running back Kareem Hunt’s Week 1 annihilation of the New England Patriots’ depth-lacking defense was just an outlier? Turns out it totally wasn’t.
Hunt’s the prime example of rookie running backs — like the Jaguars' Leonard Fournette and the Vikings' Dalvin Cook — taking over this season, while Cowboys sophomore Ezekiel Elliott has failed to regain the power and speed from his rookie campaign with a suspension and court battles hanging over him.
As far as receiving goes, there’s very few, if any, fresh faces making cases for regular DFS consideration. The Vikings' Adam Thielen is currently No. 2 in the league in receiving and Eagles tight end Zach Ertz is right behind him, but otherwise, we have the regular cast of characters of the Steelers' Antonio Brown, the Falcons' Julio Jones and the Raiders' Michael Crabtree maintaining his solid connection with quarterback Derek Carr.
Speaking of quarterbacks, Carr and Kansas City’s Alex Smith are currently second in the NFL with five touchdown passes apiece, behind only…the Broncos' Trevor Siemian. That might be the only true surprise NFL fans and fantasy players have experienced so far in 2017.
The tried-and-true stars still provide the lifeblood of DFS lineups — for now — but finding that proper combo is what help owners win each week. Here are the rankings for Week 3 at each position, including FLEX.
QB
1. Matt Ryan, Falcons
2. Tom Brady, Patriots
3. Carson Wentz, Eagles
4. Dak Prescott, Cowboys
5. Drew Brees, Saints
Ryan has kept the momentum from his MVP campaign last year and his price could be lower against a Lions secondary that picked off three passes in its first game. At 40, Brady’s leading the league in passing yardage and is fifth in yards per attempt, so it makes sense to go with the hot hand. However, he is facing Houston’s No. 6 pass defense, even if it only has three sacks so far. Brady’s also expensive for DFS owners so Wentz could be a solid fill-in. The second-year passer can light up the Giants and he can make up for his three picks in two games against New York last year. Everyone expected Prescott to come back to earth and he could still struggle against an Arizona defense that looked far better in Week 2, but Brees has an even tougher matchup against a Panthers D that hasn’t surrendered a passing touchdown in its first two games.
RB
1. Kareem Hunt, Chiefs
2. Jay Ajayi, Dolphins
3. Javorious Allen, Ravens
4. Carlos Hyde, 49ers
5. Mike Gillislee, Patriots
Hunt’s the hottest and likely the most expensive back in the league, so if you opt not to blow a huge chunk of your cap on him Ajayi’s matchup with the Jets last placing rushing defense is quite tempting. Allen could the stabilizing force the Ravens’ backfield has missed since Ray Rice and he draws the Jaguars fourth-worst rushing D. Hyde has a short week, which could be a drawback, but he meets the Rams, who are letting up 4.8 yards per carry. Gillislee seems like a steady red-zone battering ram, even if he doesn’t get a ton of yards, so maybe he’s your No. 2 back or FLEX spot.
WR
1. Antonio Brown, Steelers
2. Julio Jones, Falcons
3. Michael Crabtree, Raiders
4. Keenan Allen, Chargers
5. Dez Bryant, Cowboys
Brown and Jones are expensive but locks to put up solid numbers in very favorable matchups. Brown has the Bears, who are eighth-worst in yards surrendered to receivers and Jones can muscle his way for extra yardage against the Lions. The Redskins, coughing up 559 yards and three touchdowns at 13.3 yards per catch, will have to figure out Crabtree, while a healthy Allen is worth a gamble in DFS since you would have him for just one week. Bryan is obviously reliant on Prescott, but he has the power to bust out of tackles and gain huge chunks of yardage with Arizona allow more than 10 yards a catch.

TE
1. Rob Gronkowski, Patriots
2. Travis Kelce, Chiefs
3. Delanie Walker, Titans
4. Zack Ertz, Eagles
5. Jason Witten, Cowboys
Gronk has only caught eight of the 15 balls sent his way, but he’s the ninth leading pass catcher in the league, meaning he’s making the most of each target. Ertz has 190 yards and two scores, and pairing him and Wentz could mean beaucoup points since the Giants are likely to be focused on Philly’s primary receivers. Walker has snatched 11 of 13 balls and Marcus Mariota will look his way more than deep balls against Seattle. Witten is padding his Hall of Fame career and might be good for a few catches and a touchdown.
FLEX
1. Ty Montgomery, RB, Packers
2. Lamar Miller, RB, Texans
3. Adam Thielen, WR, Vikings
Montgomery will stare down the Bengals second-worst rushing defense and be even stronger than he was against Atlanta in Week 2, especially if you’re in a PPR-league. Miller gets to take advantage of the Patriots severely lacking rush defense this week, but could be a big gamble since Houston’s offense is so limited. Thielen clearly has a good rapport with Case Keenum but Sam Bradford could return from a bone bruise in his knee, although that’s a premature assumption at the moment.
Defense
1. Baltimore
2. New England
3. Denver
4. Miami
5. LA Rams
The Ravens lead the league in total takeaways with 10 and will face Blake Bortles, making them pricey but probably a sure thing. The Texans turned things over to Deshaun Watson and he was fine against Cincy, but the rookie has to face a Bill Belichick defense. Denver meets a one-dimensional Bills offense, while Miami draws the hapless Jets. The Rams, though it’s a Thursday game, get a 49ers offense averaging six points after two games.


After two Sundays of NFL football, seven teams are undefeated. The Broncos, Ravens, Panthers, Chiefs, Steelers, Raiders and Falcons all turned in impressive wins to move to 2-0 on the season (all right, the Panthers 9-3 barn-burning win against the Bills wasn't that impressive, but a win's a win). The Detroit Lions will have a chance to join the ranks of the early-season elite Monday night as they take on the New York Giants, who looked absolutely putrid in a 19-3 loss to the Cowboys in Week 1.
Related: Detroit Lions star could become NFL's highest-paid player
Many blamed the Giants' sluggish Week 1 offense on the absence of star reciever Odell Beckham Jr., who was out with an ankle injury suffered during the preseason. He'll be a game-time decision to take the field at home vs. the Lions, but the Giants better hope he plays if they want to keep up with Matthew Stafford, Golden Tate and the rest of the Detroit offense, which dropped 35 points on the Cardinals a week ago.
Both teams are competing in a tough division this year. Though the Bears look like a write-off, the Vikings are much improved and the Packers employ Aaron Rodgers. The Lions will have to fend them both off if they want to win the division, and would love to move a game clear of their 1-1 rivals.
It's anybody's guess who will emerge as the NFC East champion. Last year's surprise breakout, the Cowboys, looked great in Week 1 against the Giants, but were absolutely manhandled by the Broncos on Sunday. The Eagles took care of the Redskins, before losing to the Chiefs in Week 2, while the Redskins moved to 1-1 this week with a dramatic win over the Los Angeles Rams. If the Giants can manage a win at home Monday night, the East will be the only division locked in a four-way tie with two weeks of football in the books.
Fortunately for NFL fans who have to be at work early Tuesday morning, the Giants/Lions contest is the only Monday Night Football game this week, so no one will have to stay up until 2 a.m. trying to figure out what the hell Rex Ryan is talking about (or waiting for another appearance from sideline sensation Sergio Dipp). The lone game—which will be called by Sean McDonough, Jon Gruden, Lisa Salters—will begin at 8:30 p.m. ET on ESPN, and be available to stream on the WatchESPN app.
Now, because the game Monday night will likely be underwhelming, as most NFL games seem to be these days, let's once again enjoy the sideline stylings of Dipp. ESPN, we know you've had a rough few weeks. Give the people what they want and bring back Sergio.



If you're not obsessive about Twitter (God bless your innocent heart), you may not understand that the social media site—and I'm being generous here—generally features a breakdown of 60 percent absolute trash, 30 percent of what's effectively online sawdust, and 10 percent quality things. 
NBA superstar Kevin Durant, or at least his Twitter account, gave us a very good thing very early Morning morning. Here's another thing you should understand about Twitter: the more prominent you are in the public eye, generally speaking, the shittier your experience will be on the site. Speaking as a writer with roughly 16.9 million fewer followers than Durant—I can safely say hate tweets directed my way are a nearly daily occurrence. As a somewhat controversial NBA star, I cannot imagine Durant's steady diet of vitriol. 
Celebrities and athletes, however, rarely use Twitter to defend themselves because there's no point in them diving into the gutters with us plebeians. For starters, the volume of hate is likely too great to address, plus athletes like to be "better than the haters" and "above the pettiness." But late Sunday night, Durant's account, in what was almost definitely a mistake of some sort, bluntly defended the player's decision last summer to defect from the Oklahoma City Thunder to the Golden State Warriors.
In tweets that have since been deleted, but apparently were screenshot (hat tip to @harrisonmc15), a user with the handle @ColeCashwell tweeted, "man I respect the hell outta you but give me one legitimate reason for leaving okc other than getting a championship."
Durant's account apparently responded, "he didn't like the organization or playing for [OKC coach] Billy Donovan. His roster wasn't that good, it was just him and [Russell Westbrook]."
Not stopping at just one tweet, Durant's account then tweeted, "imagine taking russ off that team, see how bad they were. Kd can't win a championship with those cats."
(Now these screenshots could have been faked, but it appears to have been caught by multiple people and written about by sites such as Sports Illustrated and Yahoo, and the original tweet from @ColeCashwell seems to still be up.) 





Now, there's a pretty decent chance this wasn't Durant himself, since most athletes (especially someone as famous as Durant), have folks who handle a lot of their social media presence. Someone could have meant to respond from a personal account before realizing they were still logged in to @KDTrey5. It would have to be a social media manager who is relatively anonymous, however, since the NBA is a small, insular world and a league reporter would likely notice if a known Durant associate was defending him online with inside information about the star's thinking. 
Meanwhile, some have suggested the star could have meant to post the messages from a secret account he uses to defend himself online. Durant has been pretty active on social media recently, spending a fair bit of his summer ruthlessly roasting Twitter trolls in posts that were clearly from the player. On the podcast from Bill Simmons, head of The Ringer, Durant even said he felt he had earned the offseason social media MVP with his candor.
"I should be," he said. "I keep it real, man. I keep it real. I mean, I used to think, 'man, let me watch what I say about this or that'; [but] at the end of the day it’s all jokes to everybody anyway. They make jokes about whatever goes on in this basketball world anyway, so why can’t I just chime in and tell y’all how I feel?"
It's not unprecedented for someone with a large following to have a secret account. The Facebook account for polarizing Fox Sports personality Skip Bayless once infamously responded on Facebook with, "Skip, you are the man!"
Regardless of who tweeted the now-infamous post, it was amazing to see both candor and weapons-grade levels of pettiness from a world-famous athlete. (His former teammates might not agree with that sentiment.) Twitter snafus are often the best snafus, and this Durant business is no exception. And, of course, the reaction jokes have been wonderful.






By Monday, Durant had not yet issued the requisite, "I was hacked," or "the intern did a bad thing" statement, so for now, all we have is our theories. 


Anthony Martial still doesn’t seem to be trusted enough by José Mourinho to actually start a Premier League game.
For the moment, though, the situation seems to suit player, club and manager just fine.
Martial scored again after coming on as a substitute late in the second half against Everton in United’s 4-0 victory on Sunday that kept it joint top of the Premier League with cross-city rival Manchester City. The Frenchman won a penalty, then converted it, taking the kick ahead of regular penalty taker Romelu Lukaku.
Martial has made five Premier League appearances this season, starting just once. In those games, according to WhoScored.com, he has scored three goals and assisted once. In 122 minutes of football this season, Martial averages a goal or assist every 30.5 minutes.
It’s a stark contrast to last season, when Mourinho would regularly complain about Martial’s performances. “We are together for almost 10 months,” Mourinho said last April, as reported by The Guardian, after dropping Martial from United’s match-day squad altogether. “The same way I know the players much better now, the players should know me much better. Do I think Anthony is a player with great potential? Yes, I think. Do I think he can play successfully for me? Yes, I think. But he needs to give me things that I like.”
Mourinho’s strategy in the league this season, for the most part, has been to use Martial late in games as a replacement for Marcus Rashford on the left wing. Far from sulking at apparently being used as a backup option, Martial appears reinvigorated. It is no less than a horrible prospect for a full back to have to face someone so skilful, quick and powerful late in a game.
The Frenchman’s reemergence is surely one of the main reasons behind United’s rush of late goals this season. Against Everton, as against Swansea, United labored through much of the second half before Martial, in conjunction with Jesse Lingard, added zest and energy to its attack—a Rolls-Royce burning rubber and fuel in the tractor’s trail.
These are early days, of course. United’s schedule in the league has been a comfortable one so far, and maybe we haven’t yet had a true indication of how it performs under pressure. In Martial, though, Mourinho has a player who resembles a new signing, such is the difference from last year. Several of Sir Alex Ferguson’s great title-winning teams contained supersubs—think of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer or, later, Javier Hernández. Martial’s second coming should worry the rest of the league.


The Giants were boosted ahead of Monday’s clash with the Lions as Odell Beckham Jr., the team’s influential wide receiver, looks set to return from injury—and may sign a new contract as well.
The 24-year-old sprained his ankle during the NFL preseason and was expected to miss several weeks due to the injury, but could return for the team's second game.
After missing the 19-3 defeat to the Cowboys last week, Beckham’s status for the game at MetLife Stadium on Monday night remains unclear.
According to The  Washington Post, Beckham looks set to play, having practiced for the first time this week since the injury on August 21. He is said to have moved well while practicing in the red zone.
In Saturday’s final injury report, Beckham was listed as questionable. He will be assessed in the warm-up for the game.

Beckham’s long-term status with the Giants is a talking point as well. The positive news for the Giants is that Beckham and his team are willing to discuss a contract extension during the season, according to  CBS.
Having totaled 288 receptions for 4,122 yards and 35 TDs in his first three seasons, Beckham has proved to be one of the most prolific players in the NFL. He also has proved to be a steal for the Giants, with New York paying him just $1.8 million this season. (That salary will rise to $8.5 million in 2018.)
Beckham’s absence in the Giants' loss to the Cowboys will only strengthen his negotiating position as he reportedly seeks a salary that reflects his value to the team.
Beckham made it clear he was frustrated being on the sidelines. Over the weekend, he tweeted those who were messaging him about their fantasy football teams: “No offense,”  he wrote. “I could care less about ur fantasy teams. This is my Real Life.”


When the NBA season resumes next month and Golden State welcomes the Rockets to Oakland on October 18, Kevin Durant will be part of a defending championship team. In his first year after signing to the Warriors from Oklahoma, Durant won his first NBA ring and now heads into the new campaign with his team as favorites again. Plenty of reasons to be cheerful, you’d think.
So why then has  Durant been sounding off so frequently of late? Earlier this week, he was angered by claims that his public dispute with teammate Stephen Curry over sports brands was a genuine falling out.
Nike athlete  Durant criticized the sportswear brand Under Armour, which uses Curry as its leading sportsman. Curry then felt the need to hit back, telling The  Charlotte Observer that  Durant’s statement “does not ring true at all.”
But  Durant insists that reports of discord are inaccurate, telling  ESPN’s Rachel Nichols that “everybody [is] trying to figure out a way to break us up, so they gonna use that too.”
“We was never in a bad place when I said it [the criticism of Under Armour],” Durant said. “So it was, like, we didn’t have to patch anything else. Me and Steph, we talked about it. He had a conversation with me about it; I understood. We moved on. We the Warriors.”

And then there are Durant’s new sneakers. Printed on the insoles of his new shoes are messages from social media trolls from last season after Durant traded the Thunder for Golden State.
Words and phrases such as “snake,” “Can’t beat ’em join ’em,” and “follower” appear on the bottom, with Durant aiming to show that he doesn’t care about his critics and has proved them wrong.

But even ESPN’s ranking of NBA stars is irritating the small forward. Last week, trainer Chris Brickley suggested that ESPN’s ranking of players, such as putting Carmelo Anthony as the 64th best player in the league, was purposely controversial to gain clicks.
It&#39;s funny, I was just reading that several outlets were reporting that ESPN was near collapse as a network. They lost more than 600,000 subscribers in the month of November.......I guess when a media outlet like @espn wants more clicks/views they create controversy. #TheSeasonWillTellTheStory #stayme7o

Durant clearly agreed. “Death to espn lol,” he commented on the photograph.



LeGarrette Blount doesn’t care about your fantasy football team, and he wants you to know it.
Blount, the former New England Patriots running back, got one touch of the ball in the Philadelphia Eagles’ 27-20 loss to the Kansas City Chiefs at Arrowhead Stadium on Sunday night.
The Eagles’ failure to use Blount in the running game seemed to annoy the veteran less than the reaction to his futility from fantasy football owners.
“I really could care less about all y'all fantasy teams, get outta my mentions with that s***,” Blount tweeted after the game in response to fantasy owners complaining to him.
I really could care less about all y&#39;all fantasy teams, get outta my mentions with that shit. ✌_

Blount’s blowup—which he followed up by humorously quoting a tweet congratulating him on his fantasy performance last season—follows a trend of NFL stars becoming more irked by jibes over their fantasy value.
Odell Beckham Jr., who, with a sprained left ankle, may not play against the Detroit Lions on Monday night, tweeted his displeasure with fantasy football on Saturday.
No offense. I could care less about ur fantasy teams. This is my Real Life. Focusing on gettin healthy and gettin better. 1 day at a time.__

And at the start of September, Green Bay Packers tight end Martellus Bennett posted similar thoughts, saying he was a “real-life football guy.”
I don&#39;t care about your fantasy football team. Thanks! Sincerely real life football guy.

You can understand the players’ frustrations, particularly if they're dealing with injuries. While fantasy football has helped widen the NFL’s popularity and—as was pointed out to Bennett on Twitter—made him and others more marketable faces, there is a tendency among fantasy owners to talk about athletes as if they are pawns in a virtual reality first, human flesh and blood a distant second. Beckham, Bennett, Blount and others probably have enough to worry about getting on the field, and staying healthy, without having thousands of people remind them that they are currently unproductive.
Fantasy football isn’t going anywhere, of course. But expect its protagonists to continue to bite back this season.


Will he stay or will he go? While this question has surrounded LeBron James for much of the offseason and will follow him when the NBA begins play next month, a decision has already been made, according to reports.
Speculation over whether  James, the three-time MVP, will decide to opt out of his contract at Cleveland next summer and become a free agent has been rife. It would be the second time that  James has left the Cavs, after having done so for the Miami Heat in 2010.
The reports and questions will roll into the new season when it begins in October, but  Bleacher Report columnist Peter Vecsey claims that a decision has already been made. Media speculation, he says, can end here: LeBron’s off to  the Lakers.  
Related:   LeBron James scouts L.A. schools as Lakers rumors build
“Accordingly,” Vecsey wrote, “I’m publicly terminating the pandemic of speculation surrounding LeBron James’ playing plans past this season. For months, many in the media declared or composed presumption the Lakers would be the beneficiaries of his talents when he became a free agent July 1, 2018.
“I’m eradicating all conjecture and uncertainty! I’m comfortable now in stating unequivocally, LeBron will leave the Cavaliers a second time and join the Lakers, and return the team to LA Lore status.”
Related:   Isaiah Thomas trolls former teammate, promises championship in first year at Cavs
Regardless of Vecsey’s claim, the speculation will no doubt continue until confirmation comes from the mouth of James, who has been quiet on the topic.
But the idea of a move to Los Angeles has been backed up. In June, The Ringer's Kevin O'Connor reported that James looked set for a move to L.A., but whether that was to join the Lakers or the Clippers was uncertain. This was echoed by Yahoo's Adrian Wojnarowski, who claimed that James's championship win in 2016 "liberated" him to leave Cleveland once again. 
Life with the Cavaliers, meanwhile, doesn’t seem so cheerful for James at the moment. This is partly down to the Cavs having lost the NBA Finals to Golden State, 4-1, but also because of Chairman Dan Gilbert having let go popular General Manager David Griffin.
Also in the offseason, James has seen star guard Kyrie Irving leave for the Boston Celtics in a trade that brought Isaiah Thomas to the Cavs. Life in Cleveland is changing for LeBron, and so he may indeed fancy a change for himself.  


The Manchester clubs continued to set the pace in Week Five of the Premier League, as both United and City recorded comprehensive victories.
United jumps above City by dint of its ability to keep clean sheets. Jose Mourinho’s team has conceded just twice in five league games so far. Here’s how everyone else ranks.
It’s kind of cute, the way Mourinho’s United seems to hold teams at bay for 80 minutes before roaring past them in the last 10. Everton was the latest club to feel United’s wrath. Ronald Koeman’s team put up a decent fight in the second half on Sunday but somehow lost 4-0.
Watford was very obliging at Vicarage Road on Saturday, but Pep Guardiola’s team acquiesced in turn by producing something that approached the sublime. Crystal Palace, without a point or a goal, visits Etihad Stadium on Saturday.
Jamaal Lascelles may not be the best central defender in the Premier League, but he could well be the best captain. That’s three league wins in a row for Newcastle, which visits Brighton and Hove Albion next.
A strange performance from Antonio Conte’s team, which conceded the better chances to Arsenal and lost David Luiz to a straight red card late on. Chelsea travels to Stoke City on Saturday.
Sean Dyche’s team may be the toughest nut in the Premier League to crack. Burnley seems to have sorted out its terrible away form from last season though it is back to home comforts on Saturday when it hosts Huddersfield.
"Home" form at Wembley is costing Tottenham. Mauricio Pochettino’s team is already five points off the two Manchester clubs after a huffing, puffing 0-0 draw against Swansea. Tottenham visits another team ill at ease in its new environment, West Ham United, on Saturday in the early kickoff.
A big jump courtesy of a big win over utterly pathetic Crystal Palace. Arguably, just as important is getting Virgil Van Dijk back playing.
Teams with title aspirations can’t afford to be as wasteful as Liverpool was on Saturday. Up next in the league is a tricky-looking away game at Leicester City.
An instantly forgettable 0-0 draw with West Ham means West Brom hasn’t won in three games. There’s no danger of relegation under Tony Pulis, but also no danger of it doing anything really exciting or hopeful.
Scoring goals looks to be a problem for Huddersfield, which has struck more than once in a game just once in the season so far—on the opening day of the season against Palace. Still, being tough to beat is a virtue in itself and not one you can say about many newly promoted teams.
Arsenal produced the kind of performance against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge that makes you wonder why it has to be so bad, so often, in big games. Still, the top four looks to be a challenge, let alone the title following an uncertain start. Up next it's West Brom at the Emirates on Monday.
It’s possible Stoke is going to be one of those teams that turns up against the league’s giants, then fails to perform against opponents its own size. That will be put to the test when Chelsea visits the Potteries on Saturday.
Leicester missed a great chance to pick up three points at Huddersfield after a brutal run of fixtures at the start of the season. Liverpool visits the King Power Stadium on Saturday.
Swansea becomes the first team in 30 games to stop Tottenham from scoring at home in the league. Scoring goals is a concern for Paul Clement, who has watched Swansea net just two in five league games so far.
Perhaps the most important result for Bournemouth since it was promoted to the Premier League, as a Jermain Defoe goal overcame Brighton on the English south coast. Eddie Howe’s team visits Everton on Saturday.
A big fall, but Marco Silva’s team isn’t as bad as it looked against Manchester City on Saturday.
The game against Newcastle, manager Chris Hughton’s former side, looms large for a Brighton team averaging less than a goal a game.
A second clean sheet in a row is something to savor for Slaven Bilic’s strugglers.
It sounds stupid and crazy to suggest Everton could be a relegation candidate. Doesn’t it?
No points, no goals and games against Manchester City, Manchester United and Chelsea to come. It looks likely that Palace will have zero points from a possible 24 by the middle of October.


Former Celtics teammates Isaiah Thomas and Amir Johnson will start the new basketball season as rivals, and they’re making a show of it on social media.
Thomas was part of the NBA’s most sensational trade of the summer, when Boston confirmed it was taking  Kyrie Irving from the Cavs with Thomas heading to  Cleveland.
Forward Johnson also ended a two-year stay in Boston by joining the Philadelphia 76ers on a one-year deal. The 30-year-old seems pleased with his move, as he posted an image of himself to Instagram on Sunday with the hashtag “#trusttheprocess.”
Thomas, the 28-year-old point guard, commented on the image soon afterward, mocking Johnson. He wrote: “F that process LOL.” This sparked a war of words in which both players made predictions.
#trusttheprocess
A post shared by @iamamirjohnson on Sep 16, 2017 at 3:45pm PDT

Johnson claimed that “the process will be complete before you win a ring,” to which Thomas claimed he would be winning the championship in his first year with the Cavs.
Related:   Isaiah Thomas Calls Out His New Team, Tells Cavaliers He’s Not Damaged
Thomas quickly clarified that there was no real dispute between the two players, commenting: “all love big bro LOL. Don’t switch on me cuz it’s a wrap for u.”
The NBA season restarts next month, and Thomas will be very familiar with the Cavaliers’ first opponent of the season. On October 18, his former team, the Celtics, will be the first opposition Thomas faces in his first competitive match alongside LeBron James, as they take on Irving in his debut.
The first sighting of Irving in his new Celtics jersey came as an animation, as the 28-year-old posted the new NBA 2K18 game on Twitter.

Tony Romo was a really good, almost great, quarterback, for 13 years with the Dallas Cowboys.
He may be an even better football analyst.
Romo was in the booth with Jim Nantz for the CBS broadcast of the New England Patriots’ win over the New Orleans Saints in the Mercedes-Benz Superdome on Sunday evening—just his second game as a color commentator.
He is putting his vast NFL experience to good use already. The Washington Post noted how in the second quarter of the Patriots’ 36-20 victory, Romo predicted that Drew Brees would throw a fade to Brandon Coleman for a touchdown.
Call him Romo or Nostradamus, because Brees indeed threw a fade to No. 16, Coleman, for the TD.
Romo also brings a sense of freshness and fun to the broadcast booth. There was a moment during Sunday evening’s game when he and Nantz were discussing the longevity of Brees and Tom Brady, and how their diets have allowed them to play toward the age of 40 (and beyond it, in Brady’s case). The broadcast cut away to a picture of Romo with a big pile of dessert. It’s that kind of levity that sometimes seems to be missing from Fox Sports’ coverage with Troy Aikman, one of Romo’s great predecessors in a Cowboys jersey.
Undoubtedly Romo is helped by his novelty. It’s going to be much harder to entertain when he’s a season into his career as a color guy, rather than two games. But he’s off to a fine start, which apparently includes an ability to get inside the head of football’s indecipherable genius Bill Belichick.
Late in the fourth quarter, with the game already won, the Patriots did something odd on defense: lining up for a blitz with five rushers on their own ten-yard line. Brees promptly hit Coby Fleener for an ultimately meaningless touchdown, unless you were Belichick or Romo. “Analytics,” Romo explained in quotes reported by SB Nation. “When they [other teams] go through it next week, they’re going to want to say, ‘On what percentage do they play man and rush five?’ He [Belichick] just added to that number right there.”
Romo, the good-to-great QB, looks like he has another potentially more successful career to come.


Of course once anyone began to suggest he might be done, Tom Brady showed he’s a long way from it.
The New England Patriots quarterback, who is the wrong side of 40, don’t you know, carved up a predictably porous New Orleans Saints defense Sunday in the Mercedes-Benz Superdome.
Brady completed 30 of 39 passes for 447 yards and three touchdowns, despite losing pretty much every previously healthy receiving target to injury.
Rob Gronkowski left the game in the third quarter with what was diagnosed as a groin injury, while Chris Hogan was limping by the end of the game. NFL.com reported Phillip Dorsett left with a knee injury, while Rex Burkhead, the running back, suffered a rib injury. With Julian Edelman out for the season with his own knee injury and Danny Amendola still in concussion protocol, the Patriots were down to one fully fit wide receiver by the game’s end.
No one schemes like Bill Belichick, though, and no one uses adversity to increase his aura quite like Brady. He looked much like his old self on Sunday, regularly exploiting the Saints’ inexperienced linebacking corps with short throws for yards after the catch. With the Saints’ defensive front struggling to generate any real pressure all game, Brady had time in the pocket to launch downfield, too. A fourth-quarter missile to Dorsett, thrown into double coverage, was a particular highlight.
Undoubtedly the Patriots were helped by that Saints defense, which is managing to look as bad as it has in the past few seasons under Sean Payton. The Kansas City Chiefs managed to hassle Brady; once it became clear that the Patriots’ offensive line was going to hold up, the Saints were in trouble. Brady also was helped by an improved defensive effort. While the Saints scored 20 points and Brees passed for 356 yards and two touchdowns, seven of those came toward the end of the fourth quarter, when the game was already sealed. Adrian Peterson gained just 26 yards on eight carries, a fact that is almost certain to increase his frustration.
It was only over a week ago that we, right here, suggested Brady’s mediocre Week One performance—under 300 yards passing and no touchdowns—might be evidence that he was in decline. Perhaps he read our story; more likely, Brady went away and studied film and came back seemingly better than ever. So Tom Brady—sorry for ever doubting you.

The Premier League is beginning to take shape. Jose Mourinho, as he has done so often before, has guided Manchester United to an early lead in the Premier League, with Manchester City and Chelsea just behind.
This weekend, the league enters the fifth weekend of the season. Brighton and Hove Albion, which got its first win of the season on Saturday against West Brom, travelled to lowly Bournemouth on Friday night.
Seven games take place on Saturday with high-flying Watford, fourth in the table, hosting second-place Manchester City at Vicarage Road, while Tottenham looks to get its first league win at Wembley when Swansea City visits.
Super Sunday sees Arsenal travel to Stamford Bridge having beaten  Antonio Conte’s Chelsea in the Community Shield last month and the FA Cup final at the end of last season. The final match of the weekend involves struggling Everton visiting Mourinho’s Manchester United.
Here,  Newsweek  looks at five key talking points ahead of this weekend’s games.
Iceland. The word that will haunt Roy Hodgson for the rest of his career, however long that may be now. There was a suggestion that the defeat at Euro 2016 to a nation of 334,000 people may have been too painful for the former England manager, now 70, to return to the dugout. But he has, and in south London, tasked with saving Crystal Palace from relegation. It is too early for crisis talks at Selhurst Park but Steve Parish, the Palace chairman, was not willing to find out how far the club could fall under former manager Frank de Boer, who was sacked after just 77 days in charge. The Dutchman oversaw just four games in the Premier League, four point-less games that saw Palace score a total of zero goals. Time for a change, and the steady hand of Hodgson takes the reins, with Southampton standing in the way on Saturday.
De Boer may have been the first casualty of Premier League managers, but Slaven Bilic wasn’t expected to be too far behind him. West Ham is 18th in the Premier League having lost its first three games of the Premier League: mullered by Manchester United, then Southampton turned them over, before being embarrassed by Newcastle in a 3-0 defeat. But the noose was loosened on Monday when the Hammers beat newly promoted Huddersfield Town 2-0—and at the club’s London Stadium, which is yet to feel like home let alone a fortress. West Ham is on the road this Saturday, though, travelling to the Midlands to take on Tony Pulis’s West Brom. The pressure may have eased on Bilic, but the points need to keep coming.
Jose Mourinho said a “real legend” was coming back to Old Trafford this Sunday. Wayne Rooney, back in the blue of Everton after 13 years at Manchester United, will be taking on his former club for the first time since his departure this summer. Nostalgia and sentiment will be left at the door, as Rooney and Everton are in need of a return to form. Ronald Koeman’s team is 16th in the Premier League and has conceded eight goals without reply in its last three games. United, meanwhile, is looking to get back to its fine start to the new season. A blip at Stoke City last weekend, drawing 2-2, slowed down Mourinho’s charge, but Everton will be looking to cause more damage.
Mauricio Pochettino hopes that Tottenham’s 3-1 victory over Borussia Dortmund on Wednesday will end talk of a Wembley jinx for his team. But a win against Swansea will make that certain. So far, in the league, Pochettino has seen his side beaten by Antonio Conte’s Chelsea and Burnley's Chris Wood score a late equalizer to deny the first three points at the national stadium. But Spurs are beginning to shine under the arch. On Wednesday, in the Champions League, new signings Davinson Sanchez and Serge Aurier slipped into the team with ease, strengthening the starting XI and, certainly, the squad. With Harry Kane in formidable form, and a victory in midweek, Spurs will feel a greater confidence when Swansea travels to the capital on Saturday.
Arsenal fans, in recent years, rarely return from Stamford Bridge in high spirits. Only once in their last eight visits have they seen their team win, a dramatic and resounding 5-3 victory in 2011 when Robin van Persie scored a hat-trick against Andre Villas-Boas’ Chelsea. Other than that, the record is dire; Arsenal has conceded 13 goals in the last four trips to Stamford Bridge and scored just once. It may be comforting to Arsene Wenger to go into Sunday’s game knowing he has beaten Antonio Conte’s team in the last two games, both at Wembley, in the Community Shield last month and FA Cup final in May. Plus, of course, Alexis Sanchez is back in an Arsenal shirt and scoring, having hit the back of the net in the Europa League on Thursday. He will hope the curse of the Bridge can be broken.


A surprising name sits at 0-1 heading into week two of the 2017 NFL season.
The New England Patriots, heavy favorites to reach, if not win, a third Super Bowl in four years, ran into a Kansas City–shaped wall in Foxborough last Thursday night and lost their opening game.
The Patriots are one of a clutch of notable story lines to watch in week two. Here are the best of them.
Falling to 0-2 is surely unthinkable for the New England Patriots, who host the New Orleans Saints on Sunday at Gillette Stadium.
And yet there are reasons to believe Tom Brady won’t be able to bounce back as springily as he has in the past.
ESPN notes wide receiver Danny Amendola is in concussion protocol following a hit on a punt return in last Thursday night’s loss to the Kansas City Chiefs. The Patriots looked thin even before they lost Amendola, with Julian Edelman out for the season with a knee injury.
Of more concern, especially against the Saints in New Orleans, may be Bill Belichick’s defense. Torn apart for 42 points by Andy Reid’s methodical Chiefs, the Patriots could face Drew Brees without middle linebacker Dont’a Hightower. Hightower missed practice on Wednesday with a sprained knee.
If the Patriots are seeking solace, then the Saints’ defense looked progressively worse against the Minnesota Vikings after a strong start. Plus, Sean Payton seemed to spend a lot of that game arguing with Adrian Peterson. Which is to say that even with identical records at this stage of the season, the Saints have more problems than the Patriots.
With the previously mentioned Patriots already a game back, a window has opened up for teams to steal a march in the AFC. The Chiefs host the Philadelphia Eagles on Sunday at Arrowhead Stadium, while the Pittsburgh Steelers entertain the Vikings and their dominant defense.
The surprising Jacksonville Jaguars, meanwhile, will look to their own defense and the power running of Leonard Fournette against the Tennessee Titans. The Oakland Raiders will surely move to 2-0 at home against the terrible New York Jets, while the Buffalo Bills travel to Carolina to face the Panthers. There could be some unexpected teams at 2-0 atop the AFC by the end of Sunday.
While Elliott’s temporary injunction against his suspension by the NFL remains in place, the star running back is free to play for the Dallas Cowboys.
The NFL is seeking a lifting of the injunction Elliott has been granted while his lawsuit against the suspension for allegedly violating the league’s domestic violence policy progresses through the courts. As reported by the Star-Telegram, on Wednesday the NFL asked Judge Amos Mazzant, the U.S. district judge who granted the injunction, to decide by Thursday whether the injunction should be lifted. If it is, Elliott will be suspended for the remainder of the season.
Either way, Elliott will play on Sunday when the Cowboys visit the Denver Broncos. Brilliant, controversial and crucial to the Cowboys, Elliott is one example of the NFL’s arm-wrestle with morality. His will be a story to follow all season long.
Hurricane Irma prevented the Miami Dolphins from playing in week one against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. That game has been moved to November 19. Instead, Jay Cutler will make his Dolphins debut in Los Angeles against the Chargers.
Cutler enjoyed the best statistical season of his NFL career under Dolphins head coach Adam Gase while the two were together on the Chicago Bears, though he will only go as far as the Dolphins’ shaky offensive line can carry him. The Chargers, who lost a messy game 24-21 to the Broncos in week one, will look to test out Cutler’s toughness following a year out of the game with reigning Defensive Rookie of the Year Joey Bosa.


President Donald Trump sent out a tweet demanding that ESPN, the multimedia giant, “apologize for untruth.”
“ESPN is paying a really big price for its politics (and bad programming),” Trump tweeted on Thursday. “People are dumping it in RECORD numbers. Apologize for untruth!”
The president did not elaborate on his message, but it comes as ESPN is facing pressure over its handling of one of its presenters, Jemele Hill.
Hill, a co-host of ESPN’s SportsCenter, triggered a firestorm of criticism after tweeting on Monday that Trump was a “white supremacist who has largely surrounded himself [with] other white supremacists.” Hill apologized to her employer via Twitter on Thursday, noting she “regretted…painting ESPN in an unfair light.”
So, to address the elephant in the room ... #Facts pic.twitter.com/RTrIDD87ut

Among the fiercest critics was Trump’s communications director, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who on Wednesday called Hill’s words a “fireable offense.” 
While a report published Thursday by the website ThinkProgress claimed ESPN had attempted to take Hill off the air for a night to allow the controversy to blow over, the network has not heeded Sanders’s words, and Hill remains an employee.
In his tweet, Trump may have been referring to perceived hypocrisy by ESPN over its handling of Hill and another prominent employee, former Major League Baseball pitcher Curt Schilling.
ESPN fired Schilling in April 2016 after apparently mocking North Carolina’s transgender bathroom law in a Facebook post. On Wednesday, Schilling waded into the Hill debate and appeared to compare his behavior with hers. He claimed Hill had not been fired because “Disney and ESPN are fine with liberal racism vs. conservative logic.” Schilling has in the past made clear his conservative political views.
Yahoo Finance had a less conspiratorial take on the issue, noting that Hill had transgressed the company’s policy on political impartiality only once, while Schilling had multiple offenses.
All this likely won’t be enough to appease Trump, whose tweet sounded very much like those the president has used against another bête noire, CNN.


The Cleveland Indians had to endure a wild overtime game Thursday before they made history.
In the 10th inning against the Kansas City Royals at Progressive Field, Jay Bruce ripped a shot down the right-field line for an RBI single and a walk-off victory that was the Indians’ 22nd in succession.
The previous record of 21 straight wins in Major League Baseball had stood since 1935 and belonged to the 1935 Chicago Cubs. The Indians have been particularly severe on the Kansas City Royals and Detroit Tigers, and the playoff-contending Yankees have also come in for punishment.
Here’s the Indians’ streak since August 24 in one handy list.
1. Thursday August 24 vs. Boston Red Sox at Progressive Field. Score: 13-6. Record: 70-56.
2. Friday August 25 vs. Kansas City Royals at Progressive Field. Score: 4-0. Record: 71-56.
3. Saturday August 26 vs. Royals at Progressive Field. Score: 4-0. Record: 72-56.
4. Sunday August 27 vs. Royals at Progressive Field. Score: 12-0. Record: 73-56.
5. Monday August 28 vs. New York Yankees at Yankee Stadium. Score: 6-2. Record: 74-56.
6. Wednesday August 30 vs. Yankees at Yankee Stadium. Score: 2-1. Record: 75-56.

The cramped room in Midtown Manhattan was packed wall-to-wall with YouTubers—a relentlessly cheery bunch—the lot of them excitedly live-streaming, likes and comments bobbing across their screens. 
It was August, and the crowd was previewing the latest product from the NBA 2K video game series—NBA 2K18, which was released Friday to those who pre-ordered—and the event was crowded with elite gamers, social media stars, 2K staffers and, pocked about the room, honest-to-God, in-the-flesh NBA players. Security stood at the front door. Booze flowed from a bar in the back. TVs pinstriped the length of the room, cutting it into even rows. That was the main attraction, with the gamers lining up, jostling through the morass of people to get their turn on the joysticks (all of this, of course, beamed over the internet to 2K devotees). 
In a room full of presumed NBA fans it was somewhat disorienting to see these NBA players—Brooklyn Nets guard D'Angelo Russell, or No. 3 overall pick Jayson Tatum, or Portland Trail Blazers' star C.J. McCollum—move through the place relatively un-bothered. Sure, they posed for a few photos—and yes, one particularly pushy guy inch-wormed his way into a conversation with all of them—but things were relatively calm, a break from the usual onslaught of middle-aged fans stampeding for autographs any time a pro athlete is near. The NBA stars were focused on doing NBA star things—posing for endorsement photos, chatting with press—while the gamers were focused on doing gamer things: hurriedly testing NBA 2K18's new features and describing it, beat by beat, into selfie sticks. 
The scene hints at a larger symbiosis between the NBA itself and 2K, the pre-eminent basketball video game: It's all part of the same machine. The two have grown together, not necessarily in lockstep, but in conjunction. The NBA is more popular than ever and fans now count the days each year until the release of the game. Pro players stress about, and get angry over, their 2K rating. And with each year's iteration, 2K's gameplay edges ever-closer to mirroring the real NBA—that's to be expected, sports games are judged, in part, by their realism. 
Gamers and video games, 2K chief among them, in some ways foretold years ago where the NBA is now. The recent innovations in the league—the explosion of 3-pointers, so-called tanking, the focus on "small ball"—which, combined, represent a sea-change in NBA play—nearly all of these tactics have been employed by 2K players for years. 
Virtual has met reality. 

2K debuted in 1999 on the Sega Dreamcast, a long-dead antique of a system. It has since sold 70 million units, according to the company. It's widely considered the gold standard for modern sports video games, and has benefited from the yearslong absence of NBA Live, the basketball game from giant EA Sports that's finally returned this year to middling reviews.
If you loved basketball growing up in the aughts then you almost definitely played 2K, and the controls—X button to shoot, A to pass, Y to block—are retained in your muscle memory.
"I was obsessed with the game," McCollum told Newsweek at the aforementioned 2K event, as the Portland guard stood to the side of a huddled group of gamers inspecting the demo for 2K18. "I worked out as much as I could and basically hooped all day, played the video game all night, then did it all over again."
But to understand 2K—and sports video games at large—you need to understand there's far more to it than controlling fuzzy players on a court, a la '90s arcade games. There's all different kinds of game modes that allow a user, for instance, to live through a custom-created player's entire career or control every miniscule aspect of a team, such as free agent signings, trades, city relocation, coaching hires, even the price of virtual tickets. For the uninitiated: gone are the arcade days, with sports games more like World of Warcraft or Grand Theft Auto—it's a world inside a game.  
And the gameplay itself grows more realistic ever year. You can call intricate plays. You can watch closely as virtual LeBron James chews on his fingernails just so, exactly as real world James does. 
To achieve this, 2K shuttles in NBA players and top-level talent, then uses motion capture filming to record everything they do on the court. They then tear into all that data—while also studying film of NBA games—and create something as true to life as possible. 
And people care—really care—about the game. Mike Wang, NBA 2K's director of gameplay, said they set a precedent for capturing a player's "signature style" a decade ago and now 2K enthusiasts aren't shy about pointing out if something isn't quite right. 
"The way guys celebrate after a shot. Their pre-game routines. The way they shoot. The way they dribble. All these things, if it’s a little bit off, our fans let us know about it," Wang said.

In some circles, elite 2K players are treated like celebrities. A top player at the event in New York told me "everyone knows who I am," and I didn't doubt him. He and his team had won $250,000 playing a video game tournament.
Basketball, both virtual and reality, is on the rise. Franchises are worth more than ever, broadcasting rights cost tens of billions of dollars, arenas are sold out and, importantly, the NBA is built around highly marketable young stars who draw the youngest audience, by far, of the four major American sports. 
"It’s a 365 [day-per-year] thing," said Ronnie Singh, who heads up consumer engagement, social media and digital marketing for 2K. "The NBA itself is doing a really good job at being a 365 league. But we are right alongside that."
Singh might be his given name, but everyone knows him as Ronnie2K. Tall and confident and happy to shake hands, to the hardcore folks, he's as much the face of the game as anyone. Gamers pulled him aside on the street in New York, recognizing him as the Ronnie2K. NBA players give him shit on Twitter when they think their rating is too low. In short: People are engaged. So engaged, Singh, a guy who was a top-10 player in 2K5, is now something of a celebrity with more than 800,000 Twitter followers.
People tend to get invested with a game they grow up with, a game that grew with them. Why else is Pac-Man still around? That in mind, 2K remains popular with NBA players. 
"A lot of guys play 2K, especially younger generation guys, you know, low-20s, mid-20s, even some guys high-20s," McCollum said.
The Boston Celtics' Tatum, a 19-year-old NBA rookie, backed up that assertion. "I think all kids, basketball players, play 2K growing up. I did a lot," he told Newsweek, later adding that now in the "downtime that you do have, video games is what most guys do."
Now, to avoid grizzled sportswriter clichés, this piece is not a massive effort to complain about the me-first attitude of video games that has infected the professional ranks. But video games have, at the very least, likely grown players' obsession with basketball and, on some deeper level, might have afforded them comfort with real-life hoops by ramping up the number of times they saw a pick-and-roll or a perfectly motion-captured, smooth-as-silk jumpshot. 
"The way I would put it is [like] this: When I first got behind the wheel—when I first drove a car during driver’s ed., 15 or 16 years old, for me it had felt like I had did it before, despite never doing it," said Kevin O'Connor, NBA staff writer at The Ringer. "And I think the reason why is because I logged so many hours playing games with cars in it, whether it was Grand Theft Auto, whether it was riding around in a tank in Call of Duty, whether it was Mario Kart. ... It felt like I had done it before."
O'Connor, who tracks the league closely and is great at analyzing the game, said he couldn't know for sure if 2K helped players understand the game, but he "would assume so." The father of De'Aaron Fox, drafted fifth overall this year by the Sacramento Kings, certainly thinks that's the case, and has credited 2K with helping to teach his son the intricacies of high-level basketball.
"He'd play that PlayStation, and he could master it in no time," Aaron Fox told Bleacher Report. "I tell kids if they want to learn something about basketball, go put it on pro mode on 2K and let them play."

The league Fox and Tatum will enter is fundamentally different than the league LeBron entered back in the early 2000s. Basketball has changed. To put it simply, the NBA has done away with anything inefficient. For the best teams, gone are the days of one guy taking on three defenders (think Jordan and Kobe). Three-pointers (lots and lots of 3-pointers) are en vogue, as are dunks and lay-ups; smaller, versatile players are coveted; and play is increasingly up-tempo, with more open space on the hardwood. Certain teams (like the famous Seven Seconds or Less 2005-'06 Phoenix Suns) have dabbled with this style throughout the years, but it's hard to overstate how widespread and massive the shift in style-of-play has been in the last few seasons. Guys who are seven-feet tall, traditionally the lumbering type, are now firing up 3-pointers without a moment's hesitation.
"There’s always been kind of little previews of what we see today, but, with that said, the way it’s escalated in the last four or five years is really remarkable," O'Connor said. 
But for anybody who played 2K, this shouldn't come as a shock. Hell, these are the hacks we've been using for years. The video game truly began to look truly advanced (and closer to real life) in the mid-2000s, just about when the 2K4 game introduced icons that displayed whether an NBA player was exceptionally good at a certain thing—like a little "3" that indicated the player could shoot from distance—that hovered underneath the player during gameplay. It didn't take long for gamers to realize having a bunch of players with little "3" icons (or icons that indicated they were elite at other things such as defense) helped you win. 
Mitch Goldich, now a writer and social media producer at Sports Illustrated, was just the type of kid to figure out that hack back in the day. He's a self-described sports nerd, the kind of kid who trawled through box scores and rattled off memorized baseball stats at recess. Goldich (who, full disclosure, is a friend I attended journalism school with) had the original 2K on Sega Dreamcast. I asked him about his style of play in the game. 
"I definitely liked shooting threes—I have to say, now we have to go way back, I have been playing basketball video games since I was a very young child," Goldich said. "It is amazing to me that it took until just like the last five, 10 years for the whole league to get crazy about taking threes and dunks and nothing else. Because I made a living on that playing NBA Jam, when I was like 7 years old. And I would just do threes and dunks, nothing else... and I’m sure those tactics carried over [to 2K]."
What Goldich described was effectively the radical strategy the Houston Rockets employed to great success on offense last season, described by SB Nation as "the wildest scheme in basketball analytics." To be clear, it's not like gamers deeply studied complicated stats, as the Rockets did, to arrive at that strategy. Far from it. But in the mid-2000s especially, when 2K looked similar to how it does now but was not yet as complex, you could cheat the system a bit by finding a few stars, then surrounding them with shooters (prescribed positions be damned). And it didn't hurt that it was super entertaining to play that way—chucking up long shots, slamming dunks and whipping passes around the court to find the best possible shot. 
"It’s less fun to have your friends come over on Saturday to take a bunch of mid-range jumpers. That’s not what you do," Goldich said. 
Joseph Chan, a 27-year-old who works in tech in California, hooped in high school and has played 2K for many years. He has long approached the game a lot like Goldich.
"For me it was really fun to get people open, shoot jump shots," he said. "I never played the Kobe [style], I felt like it was harder to do anyways, but generally didn't like it."
In other words: it was more fun to play smart. And just like that, 2K kinda, sorta foretold the modern NBA style of play.

Outside of a shift in style of play, the other massive, recent innovation in the NBA was losing—and losing with purpose. Sam Hinkie, former general manager of the Philadelphia 76ers, gamed the league's draft system by committing to losing. Hinkie traded veterans for draft picks, ditched high salaries and let the young Sixers lose in order to secure picks toward the top of drafts (teams at the bottom of the standings have the best chances at landing, through a lottery, the top picks to select the best, young players fresh out of college).
I grew up outside of Philadelphia—shouts to Wilmington, Delaware—and it was strange to see my hometown team do the thing I had always done in video games. Again, remember: In 2K you're able to control every last move a team makes. So a losing season in the game passes in a few minutes of simulation, and, if you're willing to wait and maneuver, your patience gives you a stacked team with young talent. In other words, it makes a ton of sense to tank in 2K. 
"People hated what the Sixers did and what Sam Hinkie did: Tanking," O'Connor said. "But it’s like, 'Dude! I was doing that shit when I was 14 years old in Madden (NFL). I was doing that in 2K and NBA Live when I was a teenager.' It's not anything new to do that, to tank and get high draft picks, and increase your assets and be able to open [salary] cap space. But what is new is seeing it happen in real life. So, in a way, seeing how effective tanking could be in a video game kind of makes it so unsurprising that it worked in real life."
And indeed, while the Sixers haven't won anything, they are now stacked with promising young players like Joel Embiid, Ben Simmons, Dario Saric, Robert Covington and Markelle Fultz. Bad teams have always tried to angle their way to the top of the draft, but not in the radical way Hinkie did it. He entirely abandoned the charade that the team was trying to compete with the top NBA squads. It was a uniquely bold action from an actual GM. But 2K, that's a different story—in video games you have infinite chances to fix things and there's no real consequences. So you take risks. 
"In the world there are high stakes because there are high salaries and people lose jobs and it affects their families and their career," said Sports Illustrated's Goldich. "Whereas when you’re playing video games you can throw the controller and shut down everything if things don’t go well... You can be more aggressive and have fun…messing around in a low-stakes environment you might discover something that actually works."
Hinkie didn't get to see if his strategy would actually work—he was effectively forced out in 2016. He remains a Philadelphia folk hero, however, and has inspired fans to proclaim things like "Hinkie Died For Our Sins."

2K and the NBA will never be one-and-the-same, even if gamers predicted the brand of basketball that sparked a revolution in the game. At the end of the day, a video game is a video game, no matter how good the graphics or gameplay. It can imitate the thing but could never be the thing. That became clear to me when the Trail Blazers' McCollum described frustration over not being able to do his real life moves in a video game—pretty much the exact opposite of the common person's complaint.
But the game and the league, at least for now, are inextricably entwined. The league's stunning popularity helps 2K, and 2K's stunning popularity helps the league.
That much was clear in that cramped, sweaty room in New York City back in August. Video games aren't for the pimply, isolated basement-dwellers anymore; they're for kids with thousands (and thousands and thousands) of people who follow their every move.
I talked with that guy who pulled in $250,000 playing 2K in a hallway outside the preview event for 2K18. It shocked me; he talked just like a pro athlete. It was all careful bursts about working hard. "I took a lot of losses," Artreyo Boyd, aka Dimez, said. "But ultimately, that made me better. In order to get to where I’m at now, you have to play the better people."
The 23-year-old talked about his virtual team shooting a lot threes and priding itself on defense that earns quick, open shots. I told him that sounded a lot like how the Golden State Warriors play. Dimez bristled. The Warriors had just beaten his favorite team in the NBA Finals.
"Our play style, of course," he conceded. "But I’m a Cavs fan, man. I’m from Cleveland."
At his core, Dimez remained anchored to the authentic thing, the flesh-and-blood teams. Yes, he's one of the best 2K players in the world: He's won tens of thousands of dollars, and he's set to play in the NBA's eSports league, where real NBA teams draft virtual 2K players. But he remains a fan, imagining to life a virtual NBA with buttons and joysticks. As we talked, those honest-to-God NBA stars were just inside. Dimez could never be that—but damn if he hasn't come close to their world. And hasn't that always been the point?


Deshaun Watson passed for 125 yards and had a 49-yard run for a touchdown in his first career start on his 22nd birthday, lifting the Houston Texans to a 13-9 victory over the Cincinnati Bengals on Thursday night at Paul Brown Stadium.
DeAndre Hopkins had seven catches for 73 yards for the Texans (1-1), who avoided their first 0-2 start since 2015.
The Texans relied heavily on their rushing attack, with 168 yards, including Watson’s 67. Lamar Miller had 61 yards on 18 carries.
Cincinnati, meanwhile, has not scored a touchdown in eight quarters to begin the season. It’s the 15th time the Bengals have started 0-2, which is an ominous sign for the team, considering it has never reached the playoffs after losing two to start the season.
The mood after the game reflected the result.
“We suck,” Dre Kirkpatrick, the Bengals' 27-year-old cornerback said, according to  Fox Sports' Jeremy Rauch. A Bengals player was  also overheard shouting, “We just lost to the worst team in the league.”
Cincinnati quarterback Andy Dalton was coming off one of the worst performances of his career in last week’s 20-0 loss to the Baltimore Ravens, when he threw four interceptions. He didn’t throw an interception Thursday night but was off-target for much of the game, going 20 of 35 for 224 yards.
“If you’re going to win in this league, you have to score touchdowns,” he  said.
Watson earned the start after passing for 102 yards with a TD and an interception after taking over for Tom Savage in the second half of last week’s loss to Jacksonville. Watson was 15 of 24 and was sacked three times Thursday but maintained his composure throughout.
The teams traded field goals in the second half as Ka‘imi Fairbairn’s 42-yarder with 2:01 left gave Houston a 13-9 lead. Cincinnati’s last drive ended when Dalton threw incomplete on 4th-and-9 from his own 44.
There were a combined nine punts in the first half.
Cincinnati rookie wide receiver John Ross’s first career touch looked to be a 12-yard gain on an end-around, but he fumbled, and Jadeveon Clowney returned it 48 yards to the Bengals' 20-yard line.
That led to a 26-yard field goal by Fairbairn to put Houston ahead 3-0.
After 15 scoreless possessions to begin the season, the Bengals finally got on the board with a 39-yard field goal by Randy Bullock, set up by A.J. Green’s 50-yard catch.
Later in the second quarter, Watson was drilled by Geno Atkins for an 11-yard sack, one of three sacks for the Bengals in the half.
Two plays later, Watson scrambled on third-and-15, broke two tackles and raced 49 yards for a touchdown, putting the Texans ahead 10-3.
Cincinnati drove 64 yards in 48 seconds just before halftime but was forced to settle for a 29-yard Bullock field goal, making the score 10-6.


Could Manchester United move for Mesut Özil?
That is the claim from The Sun newspaper and SportBild in Germany. Both outlets note that German national Özil, 28, is out of contract at Arsenal in the summer of 2018 and has so far rejected all of the north London club’s attempts to sign him to a new deal.
The Sun claims Arsenal offered Özil £8.1 million a season in salary to remain at Emirates Stadium, but he appears determined to move on from the club he signed for in 2013 from Real Madrid.
Özil will be free to sign where he wants next summer, and that could mean a possible reunion with José Mourinho at United. Özil played for Mourinho at Real between 2010 and 2013.
Mourinho was searching this summer for a left-sided attacker to complement United’s attack. The United manager looked at Ivan Perišić of Inter Milan and was even linked with Real winger Gareth Bale, but he ended the summer transfer window without having filled that position. Özil, predominantly left-footed, would represent a significant addition in a position of need for United.
Arsenal could have sold Alexis Sanchez to Manchester City this summer for £60 million but chose to keep the Chile striker at the club for one more season. Sanchez, too, is out of contract in summer 2018. According to The Guardian, he has made a decision on his future and will sign for City as a free agent.
Real would like Sanchez, but as that possibility recedes, head coach Zinedine Zidane has identified several new strikers he would like to sign, according to reports in Spain. Robert Lewandowski and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang of Borussia Dortmund and Andrea Belotti of Torino are all targets for Zidane, according to Don Balon, as Real seeks to move on from the celebrated era of Karim Benzema. The French striker has a hamstring injury and Zidane wants a replacement for Alvaro Morata, who departed for Chelsea in the summer.


He was the player Antonio Conte had wanted at Stamford Bridge ever since he arrived as manager of Chelsea last summer. Last month, when Conte was finally on the verge of bringing him to west London, one phone call changed all that.
Having played under Conte at Juventus, Fernando Llorente was a striker the Italian manager knew he could rely on; one who would fit in at  Chelsea as an experienced back-up to its new, £60 million ($81 million) prize asset: Álvaro Morata, the 24-year-old signed from Real Madrid.
But then Tottenham, and Mauricio Pochettino in particular, came into the equation. “At the very last minute, Pochettino called me and convinced me [to join Tottenham]. The Tottenham project is impressive. They have done very well in the last few years, and I think I fit very well with this project,” Llorente said, as quoted by the  Daily Mail.

“I think I can help them a lot,” the 32-year-old former Swansea striker added. “It is clear that Pochettino played a very important role in the decision. I have known him since he was playing in Spain.
“There is even a nice anecdote because I made my first team debut [with Athletic Bilbao] against him at San Mamés. He was at the end of his playing career, and I was at the beginning of mine. Then he was the Espanyol manager, and I faced him several more times. Now I play under him at Tottenham, and I really want to give my best.”
Llorente joins Harry Kane in what has become a lethal Tottenham team with a strong depth to it, while over in west London Conte will now rely on the 23-year-old Belgian Michy Batshuayi when Morata is rested.
Llorente made his debut for Spurs in the 3-1 win over Borussia Dortmund on Wednesday, and is likely to be involved in the squad for the visit of his former club, Swansea, to Wembley on Saturday.


José Mourinho got angry after Ander Herrera invited a friend with close links to Celta Vigo to Manchester United’s training ground ahead of the pair's Europa League clash last season, according to British media.
The Spanish midfielder, who was voted  United’s player of the season for the last campaign, has made just one start in the Premier League so far this season.
The 28-year-old invited a visitor, said to have links with Celta Vigo, to  United’s Carrington training base ahead of the Europa League semifinal, according to source quoted by the  Daily Mail. Manchester United won the game 1-0.
Mourinho, who guided United to three trophies last season, is said to have recognized the person and ordered Herrera into his office to discuss the problem.
Herrera started the game against Stoke on Saturday, but Mourinho will need to rely once again on the former Athletic Bilbao player in the coming weeks.

In United’s return to the  Champions League, a 3-0 win over FC Basel on Tuesday, Mourinho had to withdraw captain Paul Pogba after just 19 minutes. The French midfielder left the stadium on crutches and could be out for up to six weeks.
Mourinho has already said he has a good depth to his squad, with Herrera being one of the players he may have to call upon with Pogba sidelined for a possible eight games.
“Squads are for this,” Mourinho said Tuesday night, as quoted by ESPN. “Squads are for injuries, squads are for suspensions. So if no Paul for Sunday, we have [Ander] Herrera, we have [Michael] Carrick, we have [Marouane] Fellaini and we have [Nemanja] Matić. We don't cry.”
The first test without Pogba comes Sunday, when Everton is the visitor to Old Trafford. Wayne Rooney will return for the first time since returning to the Toffees, while Mourinho will look to keep Manchester United at the top of the Premier League following a rampant start to the season with 10 points from a possible 12.


Rumors are growing about LeBron James heading to the Lakers next summer after he and his wife scouted a school in Los Angeles this week, according to reports.
On Tuesday,  James spent time on the court with a basketball team from Notre Dame High School in  L.A. while his wife, Savannah, got a tour of the grounds,  TMZ reported.
While James may have been innocently surprising a group of aspiring athletes, some believe it was part of the  James family’s planning for the future.
The 32-year-old can opt out of his contract with the Cleveland Cavaliers next summer, and  the Lakers have been seen as a smart fit, given that he owns a home in Brentwood.
The report suggests that the couple were looking at private schools in the area for their 12-year-old son, Bronny.
James’s future with the Cavs is far from certain. With the team losing the NBA Finals to Golden State this summer, the star was reportedly irritated by the firing of Cavs General Manager David Griffin.

He then saw the team weakened as  Kyrie Irving was traded to the Boston Celtics. Next summer, James can leave if he wishes, and the Miami Heat and Houston Rockets have been suggested as possible destinations.
In July, reports suggested James’s agent, Rich Paul, has been in talks with the Lakers, which sparked speculation over whether an agreement had already been put in place.
USA Today reported earlier in the summer that James was frustrated at how passive the Cavs’ front office had been during the offseason. James had expected the team to be more aggressive in attracting free agents.
All may have gone quiet in Cleveland, but James’s presence in L.A. will continue to fuel speculation over his next move.


The UFC stripped Jon Jones of the light heavyweight championship title Wednesday following his positive drug test and reinstated Daniel Cormier as champion.
Jones tested positive for a steroid prior to his July 29 title fight against Cormier, which he won in a third-round TKO.
The second sample from Jones’s failed test also came back positive Tuesday and the Cormier fight was subsequently ruled a “no contest” by the California State Athletic Commission.
Jones, 30, was previously banned for a year after failing a doping test in the run-up to a title fight against Cormier in July, 2016.
He was originally stripped of the title in 2015 following a hit-and-run incident. As a repeat offender, he faces a suspension of up to four years.

Cormier, speaking on UFC Tonight, said he was unsure whether to accept the belt but was convinced by Dana White, the president of UFC.
He said: “I talked to Andy Foster (Executive Director of the California State Athletic Commission) and I was like, 'Man, you know, I lost. I lost the fight.' As a competitor, that's how I felt. Then Dana White called me today and he said, 'If it's a No Contest, then the fight didn't happen.'”
“He said, 'If one of you guys would have missed weight [and] he would have won the fight, you still would have kept the belt. He said, 'because of that the championship is getting returned to you, the fight is a No Contest. If he cheated, he could not have fought and cheated and still won the fight.”


The Boston Red Sox ejected four people from Fenway Park on Wednesday night after a banner reading “Racism is as American as baseball” was draped over one of the stands.
The sign appeared during the middle of the fourth inning of the Red Sox’ 7-3 loss to the Oakland Athletics, according to the The Boston Globe, in the front row of Section Six of the “Monster Seats” positioned behind Fenway Park’s famous “Green Monster” wall.
The newspaper reported that the sign was visible for around two minutes before security personnel intervened and removed two women and two men between the ages of 25 and 30 from the stadium.
“We are a group of white anti-racist protestors,” the fans said in a statement to The Washington Post. “We want to remind everyone that just as baseball is fundamental to American culture and history, so too is racism. White people need to wake up to this reality before white supremacy can truly be dismantled. We urge anyone who is interested in learning more or taking action to contact their local racial justice organization.”
In its own statement, the Red Sox said the fans had “violated” the club’s policy on “affixing signs to the ballpark.”

In May, the Red Sox apologized to the Baltimore Orioles’ Adam Jones after the outfielder was abused with racist slogans and had peanuts thrown at him. Jones told USA Today he had been “called the n-word a handful of times.”
“It’s unfortunate that people need to resort to those type of epithets to degrade another human being,” Jones said at the time. “I’m trying to make a living for myself and for my family.”
Sam Kennedy, the Red Sox president, made a public apology to Jones and said: “No player should have an object thrown at him on the playing field, nor be subjected to any kind of racism at Fenway Park."


ESPN host Jemele Hill has apologized to the network for calling Donald Trump a “white supremacist” on social media, but not to the president.
In a Twitter exchange on Monday,  Hill, a co-host on  ESPN’s SportCenter, described Trump as a “white supremacist who has largely surrounded himself [with] other white supremacists.”
The network released a statement the following day, distancing itself from Hill’s words. “We have addressed this with Jemele and she recognizes her actions were inappropriate,” the statement said.
On Wednesday night, Hill returned to Twitter to address the “elephant in the room.”
“My comments on Twitter expressed my personal beliefs,” she wrote. “My regret is that my comments and the public way I made them painted ESPN in an unfair light. My respect for the company and my colleagues remains unconditional.”

Donald Trump is a white supremacist who has largely surrounded himself w/ other white supremacists.

Trump is the most ignorant, offensive president of my lifetime. His rise is a direct result of white supremacy. Period.

He has surrounded himself with white supremacists -- no they are not &quot;alt right&quot; -- and you want me to believe he isn&#39;t a white supremacist?

ESPN released its statement via its public relations Twitter account Tuesday, condemning the words of Hill.

Hill did, however, receive plenty of support on social media. NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick, the first athlete to take a knee during the American national anthem to protest police violence against black people, posted to Hill.
“We are with you @jemelehill,” he wrote.

With the exception of Liverpool, Premier League teams enjoyed fine starts to their Champions League campaigns this week.
Alone among the five, Liverpool failed to win. Jurgen Klopp watched his team draw with Sevilla at Anfield the night after bitter rival Manchester United had celebrated its own return to European football’s elite competition with an easy victory.
Here is how all the Premier League teams involved in the competition rated.
On its return to the Champions League following a two-year absence, United encountered a supine opponent in the Swiss champion FC Basel.
United got goals from Marouane Fellaini, Romelu Lukaku and Marcus Rashford at Old Trafford to make sure it heads Group A after one game. Fellaini’s goal, though, may have come with a slightly bitter aftertaste for Jose Mourinho, who lost Paul Pogba to a hamstring injury after just 19 minutes. Fellaini proved a capable replacement but United will feel Pogba’s absence keenly.
Next up: A trip to CSKA Moscow on September 27. Win that, and Mourinho can feel confident of topping the group.
Rating: 7/10. United brushed Basel aside but Pogba’s injury should keep a lid on any overexuberance.
That Antonio Conte could rest several players against the Azerbaijani league champion and still come away with a 6-0 win is perhaps a hint in a long line of them to UEFA that the Champions League group stage requires a revamp.
Still, Chelsea did what it had to and then some more to top Group C after the first round of matches. Conte will have been heartened by a goal off the subsitutes’ bench for Tiemoue Bakayoko, and a 32-minute cameo from Eden Hazard. But this really was the entree before the meaty main courses to come.
Next up: Conte’s team visits Atletico Madrid, which drew 0-0 with A.S. Roma on Tuesday, on September 27.
Rating: 8/10. Terrible opposition but Chelsea already has a two-point advantage in the group and pragmatically, that is all that matters.
Liverpool should have beaten Sevilla at Anfield on Wednesday evening, of that there seems little question or doubt. Jurgen Klopp’s team outshot the La Liga side 24-7, according to BBC Sport, and yet familiar problems stopped it from beginning Group E with a win. Vibrant in the first half following a horrible mistake from Dejan Lovren, Liverpool allowed a 72nd-minute equalizer from Joaquin Correa. In the easiest group of all the English teams Liverpool should still progress to the knockout rounds. But it must find a way of cutting out defensive lapses.
Next up: A trip to Spartak Moscow on September 26.
Rating: 6/10. In this group, a home draw against the only other strong team is hardly disastrous. But Liverpool will probably now need to beat Sevilla away to top the group and that will not be easy.
From the time John Stones scored the first of his two goals two minutes into the game at De Kuip in Rotterdam on Wednesday, there was precisely zero danger of Manchester City leaving the Netherlands with anything but a winning start to Group F. Sergio Aguero and Gabriel Jesus also showed further signs of forming a scary partnership in attack.
Next up: City hosts Shakhtar Donetsk at Etihad Stadium on September 26. The Ukrainians defeated Napoli in Kharkiv on Wednesday.
Rating: 8/10. In its second season under Pep Guardiola, City looks ready to contend for the Champions League.
Spurs came out on top on a strange, frantic and entertaining evening at Wembley mostly thanks to the growing influence of Harry Kane. While Borussia Dortmund dominated possession and had at least one goal from Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang incorrectly disallowed, Kane bullied the Dortmund defense all night en route to two fine goals.
Next up: Tottenham travels to Apoel Nicosia on September 26. The Cypriots lost to Real Madrid 3-0 at Santiago Bernabeu on Wednesday.
Rating: 8/10. With Real Madrid lying in wait, Tottenham simply had to get off to this kind of fast start.


Manchester United’s Paul Pogba could be out for up to six weeks after suffering a hamstring injury against FC Basel in the Champions League on Tuesday, according to reports.
Pogba, the  United captain for the 3-0 win at  Old Trafford, had to be removed after just 19 minutes, and was seen hobbling away from the ground on crutches.
But the 24-year-old midfielder may be set for a lengthy stint on the sidelines as  the BBC reports that Pogba could be out for up to six weeks, which would see him miss eight games.
Jose Mourinho would be missing his most expensive signing for key games against Everton and Liverpool in the Premier League, and a trip to CSKA Moscow in the Champions League.

Here is the full list of games Pogba could be absent for:
17th—Everton
20th—Burton Albion (EFL Cup)
23rd—Southampton
27th—CSKA Moscow (UCL)
30th—Crystal Palace
14th—Liverpool
18th—Benfica (UCL)
21st—Huddersfield Town
Mourinho, who is in his second season at Old Trafford and has guided United to the top of the table after four games in the Premier League, says he’s not too concerned due to his squad’s depth.
“Squads are for this,” Mourinho said on Tuesday night, as quoted by  ESPN. “Squads are for injuries, squads are for suspensions. So if no Paul for Sunday, we have [Ander] Herrera, we have [Michael] Carrick, we have [Marouane] Fellaini and we have [Nemanja] Matic. We don't cry.”
A player Mourinho doesn’t have this season is Wayne Rooney, who played for United for 13 years and will make his return to Old Trafford with Ronald Koeman’s Everton on Sunday.


December 9, 2014, was the last time Liverpool played a group stage match in the Champions League. Steven Gerrard hit a late equalizer but it wasn’t enough to save Brendan Rodgers’ team from elimination, and the 1-1 draw at Anfield against FC Basel saw Liverpool finish third in Group B and exit the competition with just one win in six games.
Three years on, Gerrard sits in the comfortable, modern studios of BT Sport as a pundit while Rodgers saw his Celtic team lose 5-0 to Paris Saint-Germain Tuesday night.
It is now the turn of  Jurgen Klopp, the charismatic, affable German, to lead  Liverpool onto Europe’s biggest stage. But there will be no easing back into the competition, as Liverpool’s first game is Sevilla, which beat  Liverpool in the Europa League final last year.
Klopp looks set to reintroduce Brazilian playmaker  Philippe Coutinho to the team on Wednesday night, after a turbulent summer in which the 25-year-old was denied a move to Barcelona.

The teams are due to kick off at 2.45 E.T. and the game will be shown on Fox Deportes, while also being live streamed at  fuboTV.
This is only the fifth time Sevilla has made it into the Champions League, but the team has a good track record in the competition, having advanced to the knockout stage in three of four years.
Eduardo Berizzo’s team had to fight for its place in the group stage, beating Turkish team Istanbul Basaksehir 4-3 at the qualifying stages.
Liverpool, meanwhile, come into the game off a poor result at the weekend, beaten 5-0 by Manchester City in what was Klopp’s worst defeat in management since 2006.


When Lonzo Ball was drafted by the Los Angeles Lakers this summer, Magic Johnson struggled to hide his excitement. To him, the capture of Ball was the crucial moment that would set the Lakers on a path to contending.
In June,  Johnson, the team's president of basketball operations, described Ball as the “new face of the Lakers,” he compared  Ball to himself, saying they had the same “  basketball IQ.” But  Ball isn’t the only rookie who has Johnson buzzing this summer.
“I’ll tell you, the steal of the draft is going to be Kyle Kuzma,” Johnson told  ESPN. “The young man can shoot the basketball, he also can put it down on the floor and create for himself or for his teammates.”
Kuzma, the 22-year-old small forward from Utah, was the Brooklyn Nets' 27th overall pick and was traded with Brook Lopez to the Los Angeles Lakers in exchange for D'Angelo Russell and Timofey Mozgov. He has already spoken about how much he is looking forward to working with Ball after the two had their first taste of playing in Lakers jerseys in the summer league.

“It was a great experience being able to play in front of the country, allowing people to see my game,” Kuzma told  Clutch Points. “You know, just for me to go out there and play the way I did was pretty tremendous. It’s a credit to my work ethic and how hard I work on my game.
“I like to score the ball, and [Lonzo] likes to pass, so me and him are a good duo because of that. He finds me on the break, and I finish baskets so he can get assists,” he added.
Kuzma was as effusive about Johnson, explaining how he was feeding from the rich experience of the five-time NBA champion and three-time league MVP.
“It’s great,” Kuzma said. “Magic is a legend, so anytime you get an opportunity to talk to a legend like Magic it’s great. He has so much knowledge about the game, and it’s really fun to learn from him.”


ESPN has issued an apology after one of its hosts, Jemele Hill, described President Trump as a “white supremacist” on social media.
Hill, a co-host on the network's SportsCenter, was involved in an exchange on Twitter on Monday in which she labeled Trump a “white supremacist who has largely surrounded himself [with] other white supremacists.”
ESPN was quick to distance itself from Hill’s words, releasing a statement on Tuesday saying the tweets “do not represent the position” of the network. It said Hill had been spoken to and claimed that she “recognizes her actions were inappropriate.”
Donald Trump is a white supremacist who has largely surrounded himself w/ other white supremacists.
Trump is the most ignorant, offensive president of my lifetime. His rise is a direct result of white supremacy. Period.
He has surrounded himself with white supremacists -- no they are not &quot;alt right&quot; -- and you want me to believe he isn&#39;t a white supremacist?
 
ESPN released a statement on Tuesday from its public relations Twitter account that condemned the words of Hill.

Hill has received plenty of support on the social media website, however. Colin Kaepernick, the NFL quarterback who was the first athlete to take a knee during the American national anthem to protest police violence against black people, posted a message backing Hill.

Former basketballer Reggie Miller, who played for the Indiana Pacers for 18 years, also supported Hill on Twitter, writing: “I’m on Team @jemelehill…”


Jose Mourinho accused his Manchester United team of playing “PlayStation football” Tuesday night despite beating FC Basel 3-0 in the club’s return to the Champions League.
Marouane Fellaini opened the scoring for  United in the first half after coming on for the injured Paul Pogba, while his compatriot Romelu Lukaku continued his fine goalscoring form in the second half.
Mourinho had more to be pleased about when Marcus Rashford came off the bench to score on his Champions League debut, but the  Portuguese coach had a word of caution for his players at the final whistle.
“After 2-0 I think everything changed and we stopped to play, stopped to think, stopped to play seriously,’ Mourinho said, as quoted by the  Daily Mail. “We stopped to make the right decisions on the pitch and we could put ourselves in trouble.
“Bad decisions, fantasy football, PlayStation football, tricks and when you stopped to play as a team and when you stopped to play seriously I don't like and you gamble a little bit.
“The players probably felt that the game was under control with the 2-0 but football is football and you have to respect your opponent.”

Pogba, who captained United on the night, was forced off after just 19 minutes with a hamstring injury, and left Old Trafford on crutches, according to  ESPN.
Mourinho said he was yet to find out the severity of the injury but was not too concerned due to the depth of his squad ahead of Sunday’s visit from Everton in the Premier League.
He added: “So if no Paul for Sunday, we have [Ander] Herrera, we have [Michael] Carrick, we have Fellaini and we have [Nemanja] Matic.”


The first week of the 2017 NFL season has been a little underwhelming thus far. It was fun to watch the Chiefs upset the Patriots on Thursday night, but Sunday didn't deliver many memorable games. The Jets and Giants looked terrible. The Falcons and Steelers squeaked out wins against inferior opponents. The Ravens, Jaguars and Panthers turned in impressive wins. The Colts put in a solid early-season bid for Worst Team in the League, getting drubbed by the formerly lowly Rams, 46-9. Ouch.

But Week 1 isn't over quite yet. There are still two more games to be played as part of ESPN's Monday Night Football doubleheader. The Minnesota Vikings will host the New Orleans Saints at 7:10 p.m. ET, and the Denver Broncos will host the San Diego Chargers at 10:20 p.m. ET. Both games will air on ESPN and will be available to stream on the WatchESPN app. It's a lot of football for a single evening.
The most notable story line from the first game is Adrian Peterson's return to Minnesota. The Vikings parted ways with the future Hall of Famer earlier this year after he missed most of 2016 due to injury. The Saints signed him to a two-year deal in April, but his role with his new team is yet to be determined. Now 32, Peterson is not likely to be the workhorse he once was for the Vikings. To replace him, the Vikings drafted Flordia State standout Dalvin Cook in the second round of the 2017 draft. He has a lot to live up to, though: Ten years ago, when Peterson was a rookie, he rushed for 1,341 yards and 12 touchdowns.
The Broncos and Chargers are AFC West rivals, and this opening-weekend contest will be crucial if either team wants to keep pace with the Raiders and Chiefs, who are both 1-0 and look to be two of the best teams in the AFC. It also will be the Chargers' first game since moving just more than 100 miles up the coast from San Diego to Los Angeles. Though the Broncos lost defensive coordinator Wade Phillips to the Rams, both teams have strong defenses, so this could be a low-scoring affair. Just what everyone wants from a game that will run well beyond midnight on the East Coast. If you're a displaced Broncos or Chargers fan, good luck at work on Tuesday.


The National Football League is set up to ensure, or at least attempt, some kind of parity among its 32 teams.
Revenue sharing, a salary cap and floor, the draft… All are measures that should mean fans don’t lose interest in a team that bottoms out for year after year after miserable year.
It doesn’t always work, of course. The New England Patriots have managed to override the system for the past 17 years with a genius coach and a once-in-a-generation quarterback. The Patriots have won the AFC East for the past eight seasons, a time span including two Super Bowl victories and six AFC Championship games.The Cleveland Browns, meanwhile, have endured losing seasons every year since 2007. The Browns haven’t been to the playoffs since losing to the Steelers in the Wild Card round in 2002. The Browns have been so bad for so many years it is a testament to the doughtiness of anyone who still turns up at FirstEnergy Stadium.
Something happened on the first weekend of the 2017 season, though, to suggest that many of the NFL’s basement dwellers may experience long-awaited renaissances this season. Here is how the league’s worst franchises from last season got on.
Rookie quarterback DeShone Kizer was solid on his NFL debut, completing 20 of 30 passes for 222 yards. Kizer was hit too often, though, and sacked seven times by the Steelers defense. Still, the Browns were in the game against the AFC’s second-strongest team until late in the fourth quarter.
The Bills got 110 yards rushing from LeSean McCoy, and a dominant defense held the Jets to 187 yards passing and 12 points in Buffalo Sunday. Any praise for the Bills must be tempered with “Yes, but they were facing the Jets.” But strong running from McCoy and that defense could have the Bills at least in contention for a Wild Card past October.
Jacksonville Jaguars
Leonard Fournette and Chris Ivory could be one of the better running-back tandems in the league. The Jaguars ran rookie Fournette 26 times for 100 yards and chased Houston Texans quarterback Tom Savage hard enough that Bill O’Brien was forced to put in his own rookie, Deshaun Watson, in Savage’s place. Whisper it, but the Jaguars could actually win a fairly appalling AFC South.
Speaking of the ineptitude of the AFC South, the Rams piled up 46 points against the Indianapolis Colts as Jared Goff finally won an NFL game. Without Andrew Luck, the Colts are pretty much redundant, so any prognostications on the Rams’ season ahead can wait. But Goff did look pretty good.
Next.
Kyle Shanahan may very well be an offensive genius, but he may need to be a magician to win with Brian Hoyer under center.
OK, so the Jets and 49ers still look really bad. But this was a pretty good weekend for Roger Goodell, at least in terms of the overall parity of the league. It even started with the Patriots getting blown out, which may give Goodell more than one reason to smile.


Manchester United dropped its first points of the new Premier League season on Saturday in a 2-2 draw with Stoke City, hours after Manchester City had demolished Liverpool 5-0 at Etihad Stadium.
Those results led to a shift in Newsweek’s power rankings, with City vaulting United at the top if not in the league itself. At the bottom, three Premier League teams remain winless, while Watford continues to impress in the top half. Read on to see how the rankings shake down with one game to play in week 4.
Sure, Sadio Mané was probably unlucky to be sent off for kicking City goalkeeper Ederson in the face, a decision that ultimately changed the game. But City had to be good enough to capitalize and they did so in rampant manner, with Gabriel Jesus and Leroy Sané filling their boots. This was a statement win with a caveat that may be forgotten in time, if not by Liverpool supporters. Next up for City, Feyenoord away in the Champions League on Wednesday.
United remains unbeaten, though it conceded its first two goals of the Premier League season against a Stoke City team performing above expectations through four games. Phil Jones’s mistake that allowed Eric Choupo-Moting to head Stoke’s equalizer in the 2-2 draw at the Bet365 Stadium was out of character, as was Eric Bailly’s error for Choupo-Moting’s first goal. In time, though, this may look like a good point gained. United entertains FC Basel at Old Trafford in the Champions League Tuesday.
Antonio Conte’s team was tested against Leicester at Stamford Bridge but came through unscathed, and already that opening-weekend defeat to Burnley seems a long time ago. If Alvaro Morata keeps scoring, Chelsea will be in the title race once again. Chelsea faces Qarabag at home in the Champions League Tuesday, before the big Premier League contest with Arsenal Sunday at Stamford Bridge.
This is now a seriously impressive start from Marco Silva at Watford, which went to Southampton and won 2-0 with goals from Abdoulaye Doucouré and Daryl Janmaat. Watford remains unbeaten through four games, which won’t last, of course. But Silva is building on the good work he did at Hull City last season. Next up is the trickiest test of the season so far: Manchester City at Vicarage Road on Saturday.
If only Tottenham could play all of its games away from pesky Wembley, and if only Harry Kane never had to play in August. Kane kept up his record of only beginning to be prolific in September against Everton on Saturday at Goodison Park. Spurs had better sort its Wembley problem out soon, though. It faces Borussia Dortmund at the national stadium on Wednesday, followed by Swansea City at the same venue on Saturday evening.
A terrific start to the season for Sean Dyche’s physical, well-organized team got better with a 1-0 win over Crystal Palace at Turf Moor Sunday. Chris Wood has settled quickly since his move from Leeds United.
It's not helpful for Jürgen Klopp to consider what might have happened had Sadio Mané not been dismissed. Klopp's team has now conceded eight goals in four league games. Sevilla visits Anfield Wednesday before Liverpool hosts Burnley Saturday.
West Brom’s own excellent start to the season came to a shuddering halt on the English south coast against Brighton. West Ham visits The Hawthorns on Saturday.
Mark Hughes’s side sits 12th in the league with five points from four games, hardly a rousingly brilliant start to the season. But Stoke has played Everton, Arsenal and Manchester United in that stretch. An easier run beckons.
A small step in the right direction following the hammering two weeks ago at Anfield. Arsenal was dominant against a poor Bournemouth team at Emirates Stadium, although the Chelsea game will tell us more about how it has recovered.
Two wins in a row in the league for Newcastle, with victory against Swansea City secured without the ill Rafael Benítez. Stoke visits St James’ Park on Saturday.
At last, relief for Chris Hughton, who watched his side score three past West Brom. Next up, a winnable game away at Bournemouth Friday evening.
A vicious opening stretch to the season—including games against Arsenal, Manchester United and Chelsea—means Leicester’s current position of 17 is probably a false one. A trip to Huddersfield Town on Saturday provides the chance for three points.
Slipping only by virtue of being inactive, Huddersfield travels to West Ham’s London Stadium Monday night.
One win from four Premier League games hides the fact that Everton has already played Manchester City, Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur. That, though, suggests Ronald Koeman’s club is not looking to break into those upper echelons of the league and that it did not spend heavily in the summer in an effort to do so. After Atalanta away in the Europa League comes a visit to Manchester United.
One defeat from four games, or five points from those fixtures and five points off relegation? Southampton travels to Crystal Palace on Saturday, after which its identity should be clearer.
Renato Sanches is not the answer to Swansea’s attacking woes, at least not yet. Paul Clement’s team has scored two goals in its opening four league games and faces Tottenham next on Saturday.
Monday night against Huddersfield looms horribly large for pointless West Ham. Defeat could spell the end for manager Slaven Bilić on his birthday.
Palace created more chances than Burnley and missed an extraordinary open goal through central defender Scott Dann. But no points and no goals in four games is still an extremely bad look for Frank de Boer, who must now be at risk of losing his job even this early in the season.
Has the bubble burst for Eddie Howe? Bournemouth competed against Manchester City in defeat but subsided against Arsenal. A point, at least, at home to Bournemouth on Friday is a necessity.


Thursday night's NFL season-opening game between the New England Patriots and the Kansas City Chiefs was a good one. It featured two of the best teams in the league, one of which is quarterbacked by Tom Brady. The game was high-scoring and well contested, until the Chiefs pulled away in the fourth quarter, sealing the upset win with touchdowns from running backs Charcandrick West and rookie sensation Kareem Hunt.
Unfortunately for the NFL, not many people watched it. Just over 21 million Americans tuned in, down 13 percent from last year. It was the first time in five years the game has drawn less than 25 million viewers, and its 14.6 overnight rating was the worst since 2009. Not good.

In 2016, regular season viewership was down by an average of 8 percent, according to ESPN, which is alarming. This may have been a result of presidential election coverage, but it also may indicate that people just aren't as into the NFL as they were five years ago, before Ray Rice, CTE revelations and some of the other unsavory aspects of the league surfaced. The ratings for Thursday night's game were less than stellar, but the NFL shouldn't panic just yet. Not totally, anyway.
We'll know far more about the outlook for the 2017 season after Sunday, when 12 of the 15 opening week games will take place. (The game between the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Miami Dolphins was postponed due to Hurricane Irma.) If you do decide to watch, here's a guide for who is playing whom when, and on what network.

The Premier League returns on Saturday following the international break, promising the resumption of some delectable narratives—at least for neutrals.
At the top of the table there is a momentous clash between Manchester City and Liverpool at Etihad Stadium. At the bottom, Crystal Palace and West Ham United face pivotal fixtures, even this early in the season.
Here is Newsweek’s guide to the weekend’s fixtures.
United, yet to concede a goal in three games so far in the Premier League, travels to Stoke City on Saturday evening, knowing it could establish an already significant lead on its nearest challengers.
Against West Ham United, Swansea City and Leicester City, United combined ruthless efficiency with an artfulness missing from its play over the past few seasons. It also has gained increased production at the start of the season from Paul Pogba, its marquee player (although no longer the world’s most expensive, following a wild summer in the transfer market).
At some stage, United is going to run into adversity. It probably won’t be against mid-table Stoke.
Arsenal’s slow start to the season took a horrible turn against Liverpool at Anfield on August 27: a 4-0 drubbing in which many of its best players seemed disinterested at best. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, one of the underperformers, departed soon afterward for Anfield, although Alexis Sánchez stayed.
Arsenal is already six points behind United. More significant in terms of its current prospects could be the four points that separate it from Manchester City in fourth, the final Champions League qualifying place.
Against Bournemouth at Emirates Stadium, Arsenal has a chance to rebound and release some of the pressure on Manager Arsène Wenger. Much will depend on the mood of Sánchez, and whether Mesut Özil can reproduce his international form on the club stage. Anything but a win, and the jeers for Wenger may turn into howls and screams.
Defeat to Chelsea at Wembley, the Spurs’ temporary home for the season, was hardly disastrous; a 1-1 draw with Burnley at the same venue was much more damaging. Now Tottenham faces a difficult trip to an Everton team that harbors ambitions only one notch or so below its own. Seven points from four games would be an acceptable start. Four from four would not.
Manchester City versus Liverpool should be an aesthetic treat, even without Philippe Coutinho. The Brazilian is back in training following the saga of his transfer to Barcelona that never became reality, though Liverpool Manager Jürgen Klopp is in the handsome position of having a smoothly functioning team even without his best technical player.
Sadio Mané, Robert Firmino and new signing Mohamed Salah have formed the Premier League’s slickest attack so far. City has looked impressive in bursts but needed the latest of goals to beat Bournemouth. Something—either Liverpool’s attacking verve or City’s ability to extricate itself from bad situations—must give here. Which probably means it will be a draw.
Neither de Boer, who is new to the Premier League, or the seasoned Bilic has collected a point so far this season. De Boer may be given longer by dint of being a newcomer; Bilic hangs more precariously, having bought Marko Arnautović and Javier Hernández in the summer after a disappointing first season in the former Olympic Stadium.
De Boer’s Crystal Palace faces a trip to Turf Moor against Burnley. Sean Dyche’s team is one of the best in the league at its home ground. West Ham entertains upstart Huddersfield in front of the Sky television cameras on Monday. A defeat, and an embarrassing showing against David Wagner’s commendably organized team, could leave Bilic hanging on to his job by a fingertip.


Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho has spoken for the first time about how Neymar’s world-record move from Barcelona to Paris Saint-Germain distorted the summer transfer window.
Neymar, 25, shocked the football world when he left the Catalan giant for the French capital this summer for £201.9 million ($263 million). His transfer opened up a bitter rift with Barcelona, the club that brought him to Europe from Santos in Brazil. On Tuesday, Neymar called Barcelona President Josep Maria Bartomeu a “joke,” after Bartomeu had claimed in the Spanish press that Barcelona would be better off this season without the Brazil international.
Neymar’s transfer did not just cause problems for Barcelona, though. Mourinho told The Times that the huge fee paid by P.S.G. inflated the market for other star players, though United was apparently prepared for such an eventuality.
"I think we were very clever," Mourinho said. "We thought that something could happen that could change the market forever. Normally the last part of the market is less expensive, but this season, after Neymar, everything changed and changed for the worse in terms of prices.
"I think [Romelu] Lukaku on August 31 would have been £150 million. [Nemanja] Matic would have been £60 million or £70 million. Neymar changed everything. If the biggest transfer in history had still been [Paul] Pogba, I think Philippe Coutinho would now be in Barcelona at £101 million.”
United signed Lukaku from Everton for around £75 million, while Matic cost a reported £40 million. Matic, the Serbia midfielder, signed at the end of July while the Lukaku deal was completed even earlier, at the start of July.
While Neymar has begun in vibrant fashion at P.S.G., both Matic and Lukaku have also been influential for a United side that leads the Premier League after three games with a perfect record of nine points.


It'll cost you more than ever to own an NBA team nowadays, and Texas billionaire Tilman Fertitta found out the hard way Tuesday when he purchased the Houston Rockets for a reported $2.2 billion. That's the largest sale in the history of the league.
But that's about the list price for an NBA team—Microsoft billionaire Steve Ballmer set the tone when he parted with $2 billion in 2014 to purchase the Los Angeles Clippers.
"I am truly honored to have been chosen as the next owner of the Houston Rockets. This is a lifelong dream come true," said Fertitta—who still awaits approval of the sale from the NBA—in a statement.
And, true, it must be fun for a sports fan to own a franchise, but don't chalk up Fertitta's investment solely as a vanity purchase. Season tickets, after all, don't cost billions of dollars, and they buy you a lot of fun and basketball. The NBA is in the middle of a boom. It's a league growing in popularity—especially among young people—with a massive nine-year, $24 billion TV deal.
Fertitta hasn't said much about the purchase, noting in his statement that outside of expressing excitement he wouldn't say more "out of respect for the NBA’s approval process." But he was willing to part with some 70 percent of his estimated net worth to own the team.
Ballmer, the last person to buy an NBA team, has commented on why he was willing to give up $2 billion. "It's not a cheap price, but when you're used to looking at tech companies with huge risk, no earnings and huge multiples, this doesn't look like the craziest thing I've ever acquired," he said in 2014. "There's much less risk. There's real earnings in this business. There's real upside opportunity."
In other words, NBA teams bring in real dollars with butts in seats, jerseys sold and eyeballs on TVs—unlike some tech companies with huge valuations and little to show in profits. 
Fertitta did pay more for the Rockets than Forbes estimated the team to be worth in its annual ranking. The magazine pegged the team as the eighth most valuable NBA franchise, at $1.65 billion. Yet its actual sale price of $2.2 billion would have been good enough for the Rockets to be the 30th most valuable sports team in the world, or the estimated worth of the fifth most valuable NBA franchise, the Boston Celtics, according to Forbes. 
The world's 10 most valuable sports franchises in 2017, according to Forbes, featured a couple of NBA squads, but the Rockets weren't close to breaking in. It went, in descending order, the Dallas Cowboys (NFL, $4.2 billion), the New York Yankees (MLB, $3.7 billion), Manchester United (soccer, $3.69 billion), Barcelona (soccer, $3.64 billion), Real Madrid (soccer, $3.58 billion), the New England Patriots (NFL, $3.4 billion), the New York Knicks (NBA, $3.3 billion), the New York Giants (NFL, $3.1 billion), the San Francisco 49ers (NFL, $3 billion) and the Los Angeles Lakers (NBA, $3 billion). 
And while the Rockets clearly fetched a high price, at least one NBA observer was calling it a bargain. The Ringer's editor-in-chief, Bill Simmons, tweeted: "Getting any top-7 NBA market franchise for under 2.5b is a steal in my opinion. Most marketable stars and much more streaming $$$$ coming."
Only time will tell if valuations keep rising in the NBA. A lot of that comes down to what happens with the next TV deal. But at least one thing is clear: Houston's former owner, Leslie Alexander, made out pretty damn well. He bought the team in 1993 for $85 million.


Jose Mourinho will move for Gareth Bale in the summer of 2018 as he seeks a “world-class” winger to complement Manchester United’s squad, according to reports in the British media on Tuesday.
According to  The Sun, Mourinho considered bidding for the Real Madrid midfielder in this summer transfer window, but the Spanish giant was unwilling to sell the 28-year-old.
However, Real apparently told United that while Bale would not be moving anywhere this summer, he could be available for sale in two transfer windows’ time.
While Bale is widely acknowledged to be a favorite of Real president Florentino Perez, his time in the Spanish capital has not been free from strife.
Bale has struggled with injuries and must now contend with the rise of Marco Asensio, the 21-year-old Spain international who plays in the Welshman’s position on the left wing of Real’s attack. Asensio has been in sparkling form for Real at the start of the new La Liga season.
Real could seek to cash in on Bale knowing it would receive upwards of £90 million from United, with a replacement already at the club in Asensio.
As for United, which leads the Premier League after three games, a left winger appears to be one of the final pieces in the jigsaw. Mourinho was interested in Ivan Perisic from Inter Milan this summer although a deal with the Serie A club eventually proved unworkable.
Bringing Bale back to the Premier League would represent a significant, if costly, coup for United. Bale dominated the division during his time with Tottenham Hotspur and returns a far more experienced player, albeit one with injury concerns.
As it is, Mourinho’s team looks like being a contender for the Premier League this season. Bale could tip it over the edge and make United a genuine challenger for European club honors, too.


Spending hit new heights in the Premier League in the summer 2017 transfer window.
Buoyed by a record-breaking television deal, Premier League clubs spent £1.41 billion this summer, an increase of £250 million on the summer of 2016. Since 2013, when Premier League clubs spent “just” £629.54 million, spending has risen sharply past the billion-pound mark.
Unsurprisingly, then, eight of the summer’s most expensive transfers were to Premier League teams, including the £76.2 million purchase of Romelu Lukaku by Manchester United from Everton.
With new billionaire owner Farhad Moshiri and the Lukaku money, Everton also spent heavily. Ronald Koeman’s club features in the top ten of Europe’s most expensive transfers this summer, having purchased Gylfi Sigurdsson from Swansea City for £45 million.
Neymar was the summer's most expensive transfer.   Daniele Palumbo/Transfermarkt
While the Premier League clubs collectively spent the most money of any league in Europe, the biggest individual transfer fees came from Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) and Barcelona.
PSG, the Qatari-funded French giant with its eyes on the Champions League, spent a world-record fee on Neymar from Barcelona of £199.8 million. Needing a commensurate replacement to appease its supporters, Barcelona spent £94.5 million on Ousmane Dembele from Borussia Dortmund. That deal, according to The Telegraph, could eventually rise to £135.5 million once add-ons have been taken into account.

While its rivals, in particular Arsenal, flounder at the start of the new Premier League season Manchester United has raced into an early lead.
Jose Mourinho’s team is the only member of English football’s top division to have won three out of three games so far. In part that may be due to a settled squad, with Mourinho having concluded his dealings long before deadline day. Here is how United graded for the summer transfer window.
Romelu Lukaku has started like a runaway train, while Nemanja Matic has added control and poise to the midfield. Chelsea must already regret allowing him to leave, though they would never admit it.
Very early days, but Victor Lindelof has yet to appear in a Premier League game and looked shaky in the UEFA Super Cup defeat to Real Madrid at the start of August.
Zlatan Ibrahimovic was superb last season as United’s main source of goals but following a serious knee injury, can Mourinho trust him to produce anything like the same rate of scoring? It shouldn’t be so much of a problem if Ibrahimovic does falter, though, with Lukaku now the first-choice striker.
Mourinho never got the left winger he wanted, with Ivan Perisic of Inter Milan linked frequently throughout the summer. A deadline-day move for Leicester City’s Riyad Mahrez never materialized though the early-season form of Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial suggests United can do without that final piece of the puzzle.
United got its business done early and it is no surprise to see it topping the Premier League after three games of the season. It will be interesting to see if Lindelof can force his way into the first team, as Phil Jones has played impressively next to Eric Bailly so far. Keeping Matic fit appears crucial to United’s chances of winning the league while Lukaku’s goals will determine how far Mourinho’s team progresses in the Champions League.


The craziest—many might say overhyped and overblown—day in the professional football calendar ended at 11 p.m. last night when the Premier League transfer window closed.
As ever, some of England’s biggest teams seemed to leave their most important business until the last minute. As a result, several of the biggest mooted deals did not come off. Here are the main winners and losers from the Premier League.
Leaving deadline day and all its superheated paraphernalia well alone is a mark of how smoothly United conducted its business this summer. Yes, Jose Mourinho would have liked a left winger—it looks like Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial will have to fill in as square pegs once again this season in that round hole. But Mourinho got his striker in Romelu Lukaku and his dominant, ball-winning midfielder in Nemanja Matic. United looks well-placed to contend for the Premier League title once again.
Signing Alexis Sanchez might have tipped City over the edge into the status of title favorite but even without the Chilean, there is little doubt that Pep Guardiola will be happy enough with his summer transfer window. City addressed its biggest need, signing two full backs—albeit at vast expense. Bernardo Silva looks like a younger, faster version of his namesake David. And Guardiola will almost certainly get Sanchez for free next summer, anyway.
Tony Pulis had done excellent business even before deadline day, when he picked up Grzegorz Krychowiak from PSG on loan. The Polish midfielder will add skill and power and should help West Brom finish in the top ten of the Premier League.
Paul Clement’s connection with Bayern Munich manager Carlo Ancelotti brought Swansea one of the more intriguing deals of the final day of the transfer window: Renato Sanches. The teenager is one of world football’s most promising midfielders, even after a disappointing year in the Bundesliga. But does he really want to be at Swansea? If Clement can coax out his talent, he could be vital to Swansea’s chances of survival.
Naby Keita, who will arrive next summer, has the potential to be one of the world’s best central midfielders. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain will add squad depth. Virgil Van Dijk would have been nice, but you can’t have everything can you?
Lordy, what a disaster. Arsenal kept hold of an unhappy Alexis Sanchez but lost Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain—how bad that deal turns out to be depends entirely on whether Jurgen Klopp can eke consistency from a player who can be flaky. Bidding £92 million ($118.8 million) for Thomas Lemar on the day he was due to play an international game for France just looks like poor planning.
Antonio Conte missed out on a long-term target in Fernando Llorente, while the Diego Costa impasse seems no closer to being solved. And is Danny Drinkwater as good as, let alone an upgrade on, Matic?
This is Chelsea’s loss, too, though really it is the Everton midfielder who has lost out. Barkley was reportedly in the middle of his medical at Chelsea when he decided to reevaluate his options in the January window. A once-promising career seems to have hit the buffers.
Llorente will be a fine addition, especially if Harry Kane gets injured. Serge Aurier is a good replacement for Kyle Walker although concerns about his character and past conduct shouldn’t be ignored. Perhaps, though, Tottenham could have pressed more to sign a creative player to provide competition for Christian Eriksen. The pursuit of Andre Gomes from Barcelona ended in failure.


Jose Mourinho is looking to raid his former club for a second time this summer and bring Willian to Manchester United from Chelsea, according to reports.
Mourinho, who led  Chelsea to the Premier League title in 2015, managed to persuade his former club to sell Nemanja Matic to  Manchester United for £40 million earlier this summer.
Matic was the third signing of the summer for United, following Swedish center back Victor Lindelof and Belgian striker Romelu Lukaku to Old Trafford.
Mourinho wanted a fourth player this summer, though, one capable of playing on the wing but cutting inside, and he sees Willian as that man.
According to  The Sun, United is making one last attempt to sign the 29-year-old Brazilian from  Chelsea this summer, expected to cost around £35 million.

Chelsea is unlikely to sell, however, as Conte is more intent on bringing players to Stamford Bridge rather than seeing them leave.
Alvaro Morata, Antonio Rudiger and Tiemoue Bakayoko have all arrived in west London this summer, for a combined total of around £150 million, but Conte wanted at least three more signings.
Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain looked set to join Chelsea but snubbed a move to Stamford Bridge for Liverpool from Arsenal, while Fernando Llorente looks set to choose Tottenham over the Blues.
Chelsea does appear to have one deadline day deal wrapped up as Torino full back Davide Zappacosta is reportedly set to join Conte’s squad before the window closes.


With less than 12 hours remaining of the transfer window in England, Premier League clubs are looking to finalize their last deals of the summer. But their are still bargains to be had.
While  Chelsea and  Tottenham fight over Fernando Llorente,  Arsenal tries to hold onto Alexis Sanchez, and Liverpool aims for Virgil van Dijk and  Thomas Lemar, there are some cheap signings still rattling around.
Here,  Newsweek  guides you through the five biggest bargains still available in the  Premier League:
Loic Remy
Ever since Chelsea bought the French striker in 2014, he has played little Premier League football. But, before then, Remy was known for his prolificity. Wherever he went, goals were delivered. At Newcastle, he scored 14 goals in 16 league starts; with Marseille he scored 28 times in 74 games in Ligue 1 and 26 times in 68 for Nice before that. Although he is now 30 years old, Remy may be a cheap buy or loan for a club like Brighton that is struggling for goals this season, and fears the relegation places.
At Bournemouth, Wilshere failed to quite light up the south coast. He was the extreme talent that Eddie Howe felt fortunate to have, but Wilshere never quite lived up to his potential: the story of his career so far. But while he looks unlikely to break back into the Arsenal starting lineup, his ability is still clear and, for that reason, is worth taking on loan.

Being number two to Harry Kane is an unenviable task. Janssen has had little opportunity in north London since his £17 million move from AZ Alkmaar last summer. But there is an obvious talent there, having scored 27 goals in 34 league games for Alkmaar, and that talent can be tapped into elsewhere. With Llorente possibly on his way to north London, Spurs may be willing to offload the striker on loan or a permanent deal.
Another forward who failed to live up to the high expectations after his arrival last summer, Lucas Perez made just two league starts for Arsenal since moving from Deportivo last summer. His prolific ability, like Janssen, is clear, having scored 18 goals in 37 games for Deportivo in the 2015/16 season. And Arsenal is keen to get rid of the Spaniard from its wage bill, so he could be a bargain for a struggling Premier League club.
There are two sides to Sissoko’s reputation. First, and most importantly, he’s a good footballer, a quick winger capable of lighting up a team, as Newcastle United saw. But, also, his approach and focus on the team is questioned, as Tottenham and Mauricio Pochettino saw this season having spent £30 million on him. Although he may be the biggest gamble on this list, it may just be worth it.


It was the move that shocked the NBA world, but now there’s an even bigger twist.
Kyrie Irving got his wish to leave Cleveland, and he was heading for Boston while Isaiah Thomas went the other way, joining the Cavs. Then, uncertainty surrounded the deal, as  the Cavaliers were not happy with the physical status of  Thomas, who was recovering from injury.  Cleveland felt it had been undersold in the deal.
So, with new doubt surrounding the deal, Irving suddenly seems to be up for grabs again—or so the Milwaukee Bucks assume, anyway. According to  ESPN, the Bucks have made an offer to the  Cavaliers, with a package that includes Malcolm Brogdon, the Rookie of the Year, and Khris Middleton.
The offer may also include a future first-round pick, but Milwaukee is yet to put that part on the table for the Cavs. It will now be up to the Cavs to take the next step, depending on whether it is happy to continue with the deal for Thomas.

Speaking earlier this week to  ESPN, the point guard told the Cavs he expected to return to the court next season in the same condition as before he was injured.
“I am not damaged,” Thomas said. “I'll be back, and I'll be the same player."
He added: “There's never been an indication that I wouldn't be back, and there's never been an indication that this is something messing up my career. Maybe I am not going to be back as soon this season as everyone wants me to be, but I'm going to be back, and I'm going to be the same player again. No doctor has told me anything different than that.”
Thomas insisted that he had been in constant contact with his new team, but was unsure of what was going on. “I don't know what [the organization] is doing,” he said. “It's out of my control. I just want to talk about what I can control, and I know that this [hip] won't be a problem into the future.”


It is a new feeling for Chelsea. Being on the other end of a transfer snub as Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain opted to move to Liverpool from Arsenal despite Chelsea agreeing a fee with the Gunners.
But  Antonio Conte and Chelsea have little time to stare into space, bemused; the transfer window closes in less than 12 hours. So the club has identified a new target.
Bayern Munich’s veteran midfielder Rafinha is on  Conte’s radar with the Italian coach desperate to bring in another option for his wing back position, according to the  London Evening Standard.
The Brazilian has been with Bayern Munich since 2011, and the 31-year-old fits Conte’s role for the right wing back as an alternative option to Victor Moses.

Chelsea had agreed a fee with Arsenal for 24-year-old Oxlade-Chamberlain but reports suggest the Englishman took a paycut to join up with  Jurgen Klopp at Anfield.
So  Conte has looked to make Rafinha one of his final signings of the summer window. Also on his list of targets is Swansea striker Fernando Llorente and Leicester City midfielder Danny Drinkwater.
Llorente, the 32-year-old striker, has been a target for  Chelsea throughout the summer but Tottenham has reportedly made a late bid to Swansea.
Drinkwater, meanwhile, has reportedly handed in a transfer request at the King Power Stadium to push through a move to west London. The transfer window closes at 6 p.m. ET.


For most Premier League clubs, the transfer window will close at 11 p.m. on Thursday August 31—but not for Liverpool. 
Jurgen Klopp must wait another 25 hours before learning whether or not he will lose his best attacker, Philippe Coutinho, to Barcelona.
That’s because the Spanish transfer window shuts a day later than in England, at midnight on Friday, leaving La Liga clubs available to sign players from the Premier League through tomorrow.
FIFA, world football’s governing body, allows individual football associations to decide on their respective deadlines for registering players. The Spanish window opens a day after the English summer transfer window.
Barcelona has had three bids turned down already for Coutinho, who is now on international duty with Brazil. The latest bid for the 25-year-old was reported by the BBC to be £114 million ($146.8 million).
"[Transfer speculation] has affected him and will continue to affect him until the transfer window closes,” Brazil coach Tite said in a press conference on Thursday.
"If he leaves, he will continue to be affected because he'll need time to adapt to his new club. Players are human beings and they respond in different ways.
"I'm not sure how he will respond because it depends on the person.”
Barcelona’s transfer activity this summer has been sparked by the departure of Neymar to Paris Saint-Germain for a world-record fee. The Catalans have already bought Ousmane Dembele from Borussia Dortmund this summer to replace Neymar for a fee believed to be close to £100 million.
Barcelona’s determination to get Coutinho, coupled with the 25 hours’ difference between the Premier League and La Liga transfer windows, means that Klopp may be in for a nervous Friday as he seeks to hang onto Coutinho ahead of the commencement of Liverpool’s Champions League campaign.


Leicester City winger Riyad Mahrez has been given permission to leave the Algeria national team’s training camp as he closes in on a possible transfer away from the east Midlands.
Mahrez, 26, has been consistently linked with a move away from Leicester this summer although he has featured prominently in the club's Premier League campaign so far.
"Leicester City's Algerian international Riyad Mahrez, who is currently with the national team in Sidi Moussa to prepare for the double confrontation against Zambia for the 2018 World Cup qualifiers, was authorised by the national coach Lucas Alcaraz and the Algerian Football Federation to make an express trip to Europe to formalise on Thursday his transfer to his new club, read a statement on the Algerian Football Association’s website on Thursday.
"The national team will fly without him on Thursday morning to Lusaka to face Zambia on Saturday."
The identity of Mahrez’s next club, though, remains a source of conjecture. The Manchester Evening News reported on Thursday that United has “no concrete interest” in Mahrez, the creative lynchpin in Leicester’s astonishing Premier League title triumph in 2016-17.
That’s despite manager Jose Mourinho requiring and desiring a left winger to add balance to a team that nevertheless leads the Premier League with a perfect record after three games.
The BBC claims Barcelona, Chelsea and United are “interested” but only A.S. Roma has made any formal bids for Mahrez, with the third and latest worth around £32 million ($41.3 million).
Mahrez is clearly going somewhere that isn’t staying at Leicester City before the British transfer window closes at midnight on Thursday, but his destination seems to be a genuine source of mystery. As for United—having failed to land Mourinho’s first-choice left winger in Ivan Perisic, it looks like being a quiet close to the window for the Premier League leader.


Liverpool has set up a base in Paris where it can complete a medical and carry out further negotiations for Thomas Lemar should its £74 million bid for the midfielder be accepted, according to reports.
Lemar, the A.S. Monaco midfielder, has been a target for  Jurgen Klopp’s team in the final weeks of the window, as  Liverpool completes a late spree of spending.
The club has signed Naby Keita from RB Leipzig, but he won’t join until next year, it looks set to announce the arrival of  Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain from  Arsenal, and is now preparing for a potential deal for Lemar.
Liverpool is persisting in its pursuit of the French midfielder and is willing to offer £74 million (about $95 million,) according to  The Independent.
But the club is so prepared for the deal to go ahead that a team is on standby to travel to Paris and carry out the medical today, the  Liverpool Echo says.
Lemar was a target for Arsenal earlier in the transfer window, but the Gunners gave up on the deal because Monaco was unwilling to sell him this summer.
This was due to the fact that the majority of Monaco’s team has been sold, including Tiemoue Bakayoko, Bernardo Silva, Benjamin Mendy and Kylian Mbappe looks likely to leave.
But Liverpool hasn’t given up yet. It has been a successful transfer window for Klopp as he looks set to hold onto  Philippe Coutinho, who was wanted by Barcelona, and strengthen his team hugely.
The only downside will be if he misses out on strengthening his defense, having chased the signing of Southampton center back Virgil van Dijk throughout the summer.


It is finally here. After 62 days of an open transfer window in which Premier League clubs spent have spent more than £1 billion, the end is finally in sight.
Unlike in previous years, there is still likely to be big business. The future of  Arsenal’s top players is still uncertain,  Chelsea is hoping for a few more players through the door, and Manchester City’s summer spending spree may not be over yet.
Here,  Newsweek  takes you through all the news and rumors swirling around the  Premier League’s transfer market for one final time this summer:
Arsenal is preparing for a £70 million offer from Manchester City for  Alexis Sanchez, currently on international duty for Chile, according to the  Independent. City has sent a team of legal and medical officials to south America in preparation for a last-minute deal.
According to the  Daily Mirror, Arsenal will make a last-ditch attempt to sign  Julian Draxler from Paris Saint-Germain, and if it is unsuccessful the Gunners will not sell Sanchez to City.
Antonio Conte still wants three players at Stamford Bridge, according to the  Daily Telegraph. One of those targets is Spanish striker  Fernando Llorente, who has been in advanced talks with Chelsea over a move from Swansea,  ESPN say, but reports also suggest that Tottenham has made a late bid for him.

Tottenham has also joined West Ham in the race for Barcelona midfielder  Andre Gomes, according to the  Daily Mirror. West Ham had originally been in negotiations with Sporting Lisbon’s  William Carvalho.
Everton looks to strengthen its defense even further as Ronald Koeman’s club has made a late bid for Barcelona center back  Thomas Vermaelen, aiming to take him on a season-long loan, according to the  Liverpool Echo.
Chelsea may finally complete the sale of awol striker  Diego Costa today as the club has been in negotiations with Atletico Madrid, Costa’s preferred destination, and has received a new offer of £49 million, according to  The Sun.
And finally, West Ham has made a last minute attempt to sign  Jack Wilshere from Arsenal, according to  The Sun. The English midfielder has struggled to break into Arsene Wenger’s team and spent last season on loan at Bournemouth.


Isaiah Thomas hasn’t even begun his fresh start to life in Cleveland, and it’s already looking rocky.
Thomas, the Celtics point guard, was part of the sensational trade with  the Cavaliers that saw  Kyrie Irving heading to Boston. But the move hit a snag due to uncertainty over Thomas’s physical state.
Reports suggested  the Cavs were looking for further compensation from the Celtics due to the 28-year-old’s injury, but Thomas has been forceful with his belief that he’ll come back stronger.
“I am not damaged,” he told  ESPN. “I'll be back, and I'll be the same player.
“There's never been an indication that I wouldn't be back, and there's never been an indication that this is something messing up my career. Maybe I am not going to be back as soon this season as everyone wants me to be, but I'm going to be back, and I'm going to be the same player again. No doctor has told me anything different than that.”

Thomas insisted that he had been in constant contact with his new team, but was unsure of what was going on. “I don't know what [the organization] is doing,” he said. “It's out of my control. I just want to talk about what I can control, and I know that this [hip] won't be a problem into the future.”
The extent of uncertainty surrounding the deal was confounded further by Thomas deciding not to comment on his departure from Boston, nor his arrival in Cleveland, stuck in limbo.
Related:   Isaiah Thomas may not have been the Cavs’ first choice of trade
Boston claims to have been clear about Thomas’s physical limitations throughout negotiations with the Cavaliers, but Cleveland says this was not the case.
It has put a dark cloud over Thomas’s arrival at the Quicken Loans Arena as both team and player enter a relationship with contradiction. It may not be the dream move Thomas had hoped for.


Manchester United has registered an interest in signing Riyad Mahrez from Leicester City with little over 24 hours remaining of the summer transfer window, according to reports.
Jose Mourinho has had a busy summer that has pleased him as his new signings have helped take  Manchester United to the top of the  Premier League table.
But  Mourinho was never satisfied. To be totally content with his team, the Portuguese coach wanted just one more signing this summer, a player who can play wide and cut inside.
Ivan Perisic, of Inter Milan, was his top target, but now  United has shown interest in Leicester City’s 2016 PFA Player of the Year Mahrez, according to  The Independent.
Mahrez is keen to leave the King Power Stadium this summer but Leicester is yet to receive an offer that it feels is worth selling the Algerian forward. Roma was interested in signing him, but failed to reach the £50 million valuation Leicester has for Mahrez.

Mahrez would become the fifth big name to move to  Old Trafford this summer. Swedish center back Victor Lindelof was the first through the door, joining from Benfica for £34 million, and Romelu Lukaku soon followed.​The Belgian striker transferred from Everton for £75 million and has eased into life at United, already scoring four goals in four games for Mourinho’s team.
United then managed to complete a £40 million signing of Nemanja Matic, the Serbian midfielder who Mourinho worked with at Chelsea, before renewing Zlatan Ibrahimovic’s contract at Old Trafford for another year.
Mourinho’s team already looks strong, and the addition of Mahrez would make United an even stronger contender for the title.


With Premier League clubs spending more than £1 billion on signings already this summer, there are high expectations for the purchases.
Three weeks into the new season and we are already getting an idea of who is fitting in seamlessly and who is struggling to live up to the hype.
Here,  Newsweek  rates how each club’s top signing so far this summer has fared in the season's first few weeks.
It was after Ake was recalled by Chelsea from his loan deal at Bournemouth last season that the south coast club realized how vital he was to the team. So Eddie Howe’s club paid a club record £20 million to bring him back to the Vitality Stadium. But it hasn’t been the best start for the Dutchman, as Bournemouth has failed to keep a clean sheet and has lost every game so far.
The French striker took just 94 seconds to announce himself to the Premier League and Arsenal Football Club, when he scored in his league debut in the dramatic 4-3 win over Leicester. But two games later, Lacazette, who cost Arsenal a club record £46 million, has been unable to score again and was just a substitute in the 4-0 defeat to Liverpool.

With just one game played in the blue and white of Brighton and Hove Albion, it would be harsh to judge Izquierdo too severely. His job at the Amex Stadium is to bring some much-needed goals, as Chris Hughton’s team is yet to score this season. But there was some approval in the 0-0 draw with Watford on August 26, when Izquierdo made a charge back to prevent a late counter from Watford. That will please the Amex faithful for now anyway.
With even less time to fit into his new surroundings, Wood made an immediate impression for Sean Dyche’s team after joining from Leeds in a club record £15 million move. At Wembley on Sunday, just days after completing the transfer, Wood, 25, scored a dramatic late equalizer against Tottenham to show Burnley it was money well spent.
Those boots of Diego Costa are pretty big to fill, but Morata has done a fine job so far. In his opening three Premier League games since joining Chelsea for a club record £60 million, he has two goals and two assists to his name. He has linked up smartly with Cesc Fàbregas, his fellow Spaniard, as well as Pedro and Willian. His goal tally could, and should, be larger, however, as he has missed a couple of clear chances. The absence of a clinical finish prevents Morata from achieving a higher mark.

There are high hopes for 21-year-old Loftus-Cheek at Stamford Bridge, and he has been sent to south London to get some game time in the Premier League. And while Palace’s start to the season has verged on dreadful, losing all three games and failing to score a goal, Loftus-Cheek has been the standout performer. Athletic and powerful, with a lethal shot, the midfielder has provided a small ray of hope for manager Frank de Boer.
It was meant to be a sentimental move, but Rooney’s return to Goodison Park at the age of 31, 13 years after leaving for Manchester United, has been anything but that. He scored the winning goal against Stoke and put Everton ahead against Manchester City. It’s not even September, and Rooney has already played seven games this season.
There were never any great expectations for Huddersfield in the Premier League, and we got that wrong. And Australian midfielder Mooy was barely known before he scored the winner against Newcastle last weekend to see David Wagner’s team go—temporarily—top of the Premier League. While Huddersfield have been the surprise team of the season so far, Mooy is certainly the surprise signing.
There were times last season when Iheanacho was outshining Marcus Rashford, his youthful rival at Manchester's other club. Both young strikers were impressing, but the Nigerian appeared to be the more complete player, leading Leicester to pay £25 million for him. But so far, he has played just eight minutes of the defeat at the Emirates Stadium, and Craig Shakespeare will be hoping for more.
Philippe who? Jurgen Klopp’s front three at Liverpool have looked as deadly as ever after the arrival of Salah from Roma this summer. The Egyptian winger failed to set the league alight with Chelsea three years ago, but under Klopp he has linked up with Sadio Mane and Roberto Firmino perfectly, scoring twice and assisting once.

One of the Monaco alumni expected to thrive abroad. The one-footed wizard is yet to find his place on Pep Guardiola’s team, as he tries to fit in alongside David Silva, Kevin De Bruyne, Leroy Sane, Yaya Toure and Fernandinho. It’s a talented but cramped midfield, and Silva could turn out to be one of Guardiola’s key players. But for now, he’s finding his footing in English football.
The £75 million fee Manchester United paid for Lukaku is increasingly looking like good value for money. With three goals in three games so far this season, the Belgian striker is looking comfortable in the No. 9 jersey at Old Trafford. He would have had a perfect start to life under Jose Mourinho had he not seen his penalty against Leicester City saved on August 26.

After making his move to St. James’ Park permanent, having excelled in the promotion winning season last year, Atsu, like Newcastle, is starting to ease into Premier League life. Setting up a goal in the 3-0 win over West Ham sparked life into both Rafael Benitez’s team and especially the 25-year-old winger.
Steady. It’s been a positive start to life in England for Lemina after completing his move from Italian giant Juventus this summer. In the defensive midfield position, Southampton has kept two clean sheets in the league this season with a couple of goalless draws. It may be the attacking position that is more of a concern for the Saints.
Stoke has managed to attract another European starlet. After Bojan, now comes Jese. And he was quick to make his mark on the Bet 365 crowd after joining from Paris Saint-Germain on loan. The 24-year-old scored the only goal in a 1-0 win over Arsenal and has looked like the most talented player in Mark Hughes's squad. Jese could turn out to be the best business of the summer if that form continues.
There are high hopes for Mesa after his move from Spain to Wales, but he hasn’t had the easiest start, with a 4-0 beating from Manchester United. The 28-year-old midfielder may fear Swansea’s links to signing another midfielder, Renato Sanches, on loan from Bayern Munich.
With such little business so far this summer, it is tricky to put Spurs on the list. Sanchez, the center back signed from Ajax, is expected to follow in the footsteps of Jan Vertonghen and Toby Alderweireld, who make up the most feared defensive line in England. But we’re yet to see it. He came on to play one minute against Burnley at Wembley on August 27, and, unfortunately for the 21-year-old, Burnley scored its equalizer in that time.
The signing of Gray was a big coup for Marco Silva at his new club. Burnley is a direct rival to Watford, so to take its prolific striker away was a fine piece of business. But Watford is yet to see the goals. In four appearances, Gray has not found the target. But with Watford enjoying a positive start to the season, the pressure is not too high for Gray just yet.
In 2013, Rodriguez’s performances earned him a call up to Roy Hodgson’s England squad, but injuries have hindered him since. Tony Pulis’s West Brom paid Southampton £12 million for him this summer, and he is already paying that back. Rodriguez has two goals in his last two games, and the Baggies will hope that trend continues.
West Ham could end up paying Stoke City £25 million for Arnautovic. Such a high sum comes for the fact that he guarantees a skillful ability with goals, but there are more certainties with the Austrian forward. Arnautovic is a temperamental player, and West Ham has already seen that after he was sent off against Southampton in the second game of the season, a second defeat in a row.


The speculation will go on for another 12 months. With the option to leave Cleveland next summer, what NBA jersey will LeBron James be wearing in a year’s time?
It is debated at the Quickens Loan Arena, in newspapers, in bars across the country, and on  The Bill Simmons Podcast. Simmons was joined by  Golden State star Kevin Durant to discuss the future of the  Cavaliers man, and they have different opinions.
Both men believed in their prediction so much so that a wager was placed on the outcome: The loser would buy the other man a Fat Sal’s combo meal. So, what were the predictions?
Durant expects little change. “I personally always said he was staying,” the Warriors forward said. “I told him this. That’s me. I feel like he’s going to end it in Cleveland. That’s his crib now. He run it and he gonna turn it into something mega when he’s done. He’s going to do something.”
But Simmons sees  James heading west. “I’m betting L.A.,” he said. “I think the Lakers thing makes a lot of sense.”
Related:   The Trade Cavaliers Must Make to Hold Onto LeBron James Next Summer
The turbulent offseason in Cleveland has been one signal that James may head for the exit when he has the opportunity next summer. David Griffin, the former General Manager of the Cavs, was popular with James but was fired by owner Dan Gilbert.
There has been change in the roster as well. James was disappointed to see Kyrie Irving make a trade request, and is yet to comment on the incoming Isaiah Thomas, who is coming the other way from the Celtics as part of the trade.
Simmons’ prediction that James will end up with the Lakers is partly backed up by the fact the 32-year-old has a home in Los Angeles, where he has spent much of the summer.
But the two men will have to wait until next summer to find out what James will do next, and, more importantly, who wins the Fat Sal’s combo.


Throughout the summer, no matter what subject he discussed, Arsene Wenger spoke with hope.
He was constantly questioned about the contracts of  Arsenal’s key players—how the club had allowed Alexis Sanchez, Mesut Ozil and  Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain’s contracts to run down withut trying to renew them.  Wenger’s response always suggested some belief that, through performances, those players would be convinced that they wanted to remain at the Emirates Stadium, and not leave for free next summer.
Performances and, more importantly, results it seems, have had an effect on whether Arsenal’s players want to stay or go—and in most cases it’s the latter. Arsenal has held on for as long as it can, but the board cannot risk seeing £50 million players walk out the door for nothing.
So, with just 48 hours remaining of the transfer window, Arsenal may need to install a swing door for the amount of players who could be on their way out of it.
Oxlade-Chamberlain’s exit looks inevitable; it is now just a matter of where he goes. At the moment, that looks likely to be Stamford Bridge with  Chelsea, but  Liverpool is reportedly also in the hunt for the 24-year-old midfielder, and reports suggest Oxlade-Chamberlain prefers Anfield.

The most talked about player of the summer at Arsenal is Sanchez. Images of the Chilean forward in serious talks with Wenger have been doing the rounds, with Sanchez looking likely to leave.
On Tuesday, he looked set for Manchester City, but Arsenal reportedly wanted a player from City as part of the deal. Arsenal rejected a cash-only offer of £50 million, in the hope that Raheem Sterling or Sergio Aguero could be part of a cash-plus-player trade.
And even Shkodran Mustafi could be on his way out of north London. The German center back was signed for £35 million last summer, but found himself watching from the bench as Liverpool eased passed the Arsenal defense on Sunday to a 4-0 victory.
Mustafi could be on his way to Inter Milan on a loan deal with a view to a permanent move next summer, the  Daily Mail says.
With no Champions League football and chances of a Premier League title slipping away before the leaves even begin to darken, hope at Arsenal is increasingly disappearing.


After such a long summer, with more than £1 billion spent in the transfer market, there are only 48 hours remaining until the window closes.
Liverpool is highly active,  Arsenal may be doing more business than it wants to, and  Chelsea is desperate to get a final few deals completed before the August 31 deadline.
Here,  Newsweek  guides you through all the news and rumors circling the transfer market as the window closes:
Chelsea wanted to complete the signing of  Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain after reportedly agreeing a fee of £40 million ($55 million) with Arsenal. But the  Daily Mail says Antonio Conte’s team fears the 24-year-old midfielder is stalling on agreeing personal terms as he would prefer a move to Liverpool.
After a successful summer, Jurgen Klopp’s Liverpool may have a sour end to August. According to  Yahoo, the Anfield club has agreed to sell 25-year-old Brazilian midfielder  Philippe Coutinho to Barcelona for £148 million.
Tottenham has long looked the likely destination for Everton midfielder  Ross Barkley, but now the transfer looks unlikely to happen as the  London Evening Standard says Spurs has concerns over the 23-year-old midfielder’s injury issues.

West Brom center back  Jonny Evans looks set to join Manchester City and would snub any offer from Arsenal, according to the  Daily Mail.
Southampton’s wantaway defender  Virgil van Dijk is still clinging to hope that he can get the transfer he so desires before the window closes. Liverpool has looked the likely destination, but Arsenal and Chelsea are also lurking for the 26-year-old Dutch center back, according to the  Independent.
Newly promoted Newcastle United may be about to lose its striker  Dwight Gayle as manager Rafael Benitez is willing to sell for a fee of around £18 million, according to The Guardian.


Say you're walking the streets of New York City—perhaps near my local grocery store in Astoria, Queens (shoutout Key Food)—and you happen to spot me trawling through the jalapeños attempting to discern which peppers appear especially spicy. If you, my good friend and dear reader, approach me and strike up a conversation about your fantasy football roster, know that I will grimace and nod politely. I am nothing if not a coward who avoids confrontation. 
But internally I will be screaming. 
I do not need to hear about your fantasy team. Please. Just please. It feels almost played out to complain about this in the year of our lord two-thousand-and-seventeen and yet, AND YET, without a shred of doubt before this week is done—as jabronis nationwide draft fantasy football teams—I will no doubt be regaled multiple times with tales of brilliance and mastery of all things fantasy (otherwise known as reading the ESPN position rankings like everyone else.) 
So, if you—godforsaken internet person who clicked on my content—find yourself one-on-one with me, here are a few things I would rather politely endure than listen to you describe how, "Actually, drafting Kirk Cousins as early as you did was genius."
1. I would rather hear about a stranger's ingrown toenail than listen to you jabber about running backs. God, I would happily hear about how the problem was ignored for a while then things got infected and now it's got this awful puss—goopy and yellow and thick—that just won't fix itself and "Here, why do you don't take a look..."
2. I would rather invite a college sophomore from, say, the University of Vermont or UC Boulder and fire up, at exactly the same time, The Wizard of Oz  and The Dark Side of the Moon then just see what that student has to say for the next couple of hours.
3. I would rather challenge a dad, any dad, to remember the year something happened then listen to the inevitable oscillations among, "It was '89, well no, it was '91, ah but I don't think Janet was born yet so it must have been 1990 but wait, no, yes, it was '89 because I was jogging a lot at the time and well, maybe it was..."
4. I would rather watch The Emoji Movie than hear half a syllable about "how your strategy makes sense in a PPR-style league."
5. I would rather fall into some sort of mysterious portal and be forced to relive the time I called my elementary-school teacher "mom" than be forced to bear 2 minutes of you rattling off wide receivers you think will take you over the top this year; holy shit, I don't care.
6. To ward off your fantasy preachings, I would rather sit on the New York City subway, which proves daily to be a near-Sisyphean task of fighting hordes of passengers, enduring unbearable heat and zen-acceptance of bureaucratic slothfulness. 
7. Speaking of New York things, I would rather attend a gig for Knicks owner James Dolan's shitty blues band/vanity project.  
8. Do you know that thing where you eat too much Cap'n Crunch and it scrapes the roof of your mouth, leaving little dangly bits of flesh in the wake of the deluge of crunch? I'd rather have that than hear a single thing about your fantasy draft.
9. I would rather plop myself directly across from one of those people who slurps everything really loudly—I'm talking inner-ear rattling sluuuuuuuuuuurps—and sit through them deliberately housing a family-sized pot of soup.
10. You know those YouTube personalities who start their videos with "Hey guys!"—those online monsters who peddle a witch's brew of bootstrap optimism, crap products and influence over The Teens? I would rather watch their latest 20-minute soliloquy on how a good life starts with reminding yourself of your truth and a particular avocado oil than hear one word about how, actually, taking a kicker before the last round was innovation at its finest. 


Week three of the Premier League season continued a theme, as Manchester United powered on at the top of the table.
Draws for Huddersfield Town and West Bromwich Albion meant United is the only team left in the league with a perfect record. Here’s how the power rankings look after three games.
Top of the league, still, and still no goals conceded. Mourinho’s United juggernaut keeps on rolling. A visit to Stoke City is next up after the international break for Paul Pogba and co.
No Coutinho, no problem. Liverpool carried its blistering form from its two-legged Champions League playoff victory over Hoffenheim into the weekend, toying with an admittedly woeful Arsenal. Somehow, Liverpool looks in better shape than Manchester City heading into that huge game at Etihad Stadium on September 9.
Somehow, City keeps finding ways to win despite not playing to its potential and having players sent off. Raheem Sterling saved Pep Guardiola for the second game in a row by scoring the winner against Bournemouth on Saturday in injury time before Sterling was dismissed for celebrating with the City fans. City could have easily left with nothing, though, had Bournemouth striker Benik Afobe not spurned a chance seconds earlier. At some point soon it will start playing well, and that is a concern for everyone else.
Dominant against Everton at Stamford Bridge by a wider margin than the 2-0 scoreline, talk of a crisis suddenly seems a very long time ago. Chelsea could still do with clearing up the Diego Costa stand-off before the end of the transfer window, mind.
Still unbeaten, and like United, yet to concede a goal. Unlike United, Huddersfield looks like it could struggle to score, too. David Wagner’s impressive team visits struggling West Ham United following the international break.
Still unbeaten, and it’s a measure of West Brom’s progress under Tony Pulis that his team should have felt disappointed not to beat an obdurate Stoke City team at The Hawthorns on Sunday. Now Pulis must resist offers for his best defender, Jonny Evans, before the transfer window closes.
Perhaps a 0-0 draw at home against Brighton and Hove Albion isn’t too much cause for celebration. But having lost Miguel Britos to a red card on 24 minutes, Marco Silva will have been happy to escape with his team’s own unbeaten record intact. Watford travels to Southampton on September 9.
The purchase of Chris Wood is already paying off. Wood’s calm finish grabbed Burnley an impressive point at Wembley against Tottenham Hotspur. In a reverse of last season, Burnley’s form away from Turf Moor continues to be better than at its home ground. Crystal Palace visits next.
There is no shame in being well beaten away from home, and Everton have had two tremendously tricky away fixtures so far. Ronald Koeman would like to add a striker before the end of the transfer window.
For Everton, read Leicester and vice versa. Losing Jamie Vardy would be a significant blow. Jonny Evans and/or Mohamed Elneny would be terrific additions.
A good start will become a great one for Mauricio Pellegrino if Southampton can beat Watford after the international break.
Much, much better. Mikel Merino looks a fine addition, although West Ham are poor enough to make it difficult to evaluate Newcastle comprehensively on the basis of one comfortable win alone.
Back to mid-table for Stoke, which out-shot West Brom at the Hawthorns but had to rely on a defensive mistake to snatch a draw. Mourinho’s marauders come next.
Breathing room for Paul Clement, who nevertheless needs a replacement for Gylfi Sigurdsson before the transfer window closes.
No points from its first three games, but Eddie Howe’s club played better than a team battling relegation against Manchester City.
With one point from its last two games, Mauricio Pochettino’s team is already well off the pace of Manchester United.
A point is better than none for Chris Hughton’s struggling side, but Brighton may come to rue not putting ten-man Watford away.
Frank De Boer’s side has yet to score in three completed games. That’s bad, obviously. The rot must stop soon or the Dutchman will be the first Premier League manager this season out of a job.
Rock bottom, with ten goals conceded in three games. Slaven Bilic and De Boer may be competing now to see who gets fired first.
That new contract for Arsene Wenger looks worse by the day. Liverpool schooled, roasted, humiliated Arsenal, sending red shirts scurrying back to north London in their thousands. This was the most abject performance by any Premier League team so far this season.


It is a photograph that has been doing the rounds in recent weeks, mocked for its false promise. Arsene Wenger, in 2012, stands father-like over the future of his Arsenal team that had British blood flowing through it.
From left to right, Carl Jenkinson, Aaron Ramsey, Jack Wilshere, Kieran Gibbs and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain smile as they pen long-term contracts at  Arsenal. Five years on, only Ramsey remains a key figure in the first-team, with Gibbs and Oxlade-Chamberlain both set to leave this week for West Brom and  Chelsea, respectively.
There is a possibility, come Friday, that it may be Antonio Conte who assumes the role of Wenger, standing over his new British core. Oxlade-Chamberlain is just one of three English players the  Chelsea manager reportedly wants before the August 31 transfer deadline; Everton’s Ross Barkley and Leicester’s Danny Drinkwater are also targets for the west London club, according to  The Times.
But with  Conte and Chelsea already spending £150 million (about $194 million) this summer, where would the new arrivals fit into the  Premier League champion’s new-look team?  Newsweek  takes a look:
The 24-year-old Arsenal man is on his way to Stamford Bridge in a deal worth around £40 million (about $52 million), according to the  BBC. Chamberlain is capable of playing in an attacking midfield position as well as on the wings, giving Conte options for Chelsea’s packed schedule. But Chamberlain, known as "the Ox" at the Emirates Stadium, has been an attractive addition to Conte due to his versatility. Potentially, the midfielder could fill the role of right wing-back at Chelsea, sharing the role with Victor Moses, who Conte successfully remodeled last season after three disastrous years at Stamford Bridge.

Since making his debut for Everton five years ago, Ross Barkley has been full of promise. Tall, strong, athletic, fast, smart, with a lethal shot, the 23-year-old possesses all the assets a top Premier League player requires. But, three managers later at Goodison Park, Barkley has failed to progress, to take that next step in his career. Now, it seems, he wants to do that elsewhere. Conte may see him as the creative link in his midfield, able to play box-to-box unlike Cesc Fabregas. With N’Golo Kante and Tiemoue Bakayoko alongside him, Barkley could make up one of the most imposing midfield trios in the Premier League. But Conte will demand discipline. Barkley frustrated Ronald Koeman throughout last season, yet it seems the Italian manager believes he can get the best out of him.
When Chelsea sold Nemanja Matic to Manchester United for £40 million, it came as a surprise to many that Danny Drinkwater was identified as his replacement. The Leicester City man won the title alongside Kante in 2016 but, like the rest of the Foxes, failed to live up to the performance last season. But with Chelsea competing on four fronts this season, returning to the Champions League, Conte is in need of back-up in midfield. At the moment, he has three central midfielders in Kante, Fabregas and Bakayoko but needs reinforcements, and Conte sees Drinkwater’s industrious efforts as fitting with his own work ethos.


A heavy sigh of relief was almost audible across Merseyside on Monday as Ousmane Dembele was unveiled 1,150 miles away in Catalonia as FC Barcelona’s record signing.
Liverpool has little to do with the deal, but therein lies the comfort for  Jurgen Klopp and his team. The fear at Anfield this summer has been that Barcelona’s big unveiling would be centered around  Philippe Coutinho, the jewel in Klopp’s team last season.
Instead,  Coutinho remains a  Liverpool player, set to be inserted back into the team when he finally recovers from a back injury. But could there be a last-minute twist to the plot? Here,  Newsweek  looks at why everything still points toward Coutinho playing at the Camp Nou by September.
Coutinho is yet to play a minute of football for Liverpool this season. Down to injury, the club say. The official line is that the Brazilian midfielder is struggling with a pain in his back, which has kept him sidelined and away from the pitch so far this campaign. So it came as quite a surprise—or possibly not so great—for Liverpool fans to see images of Coutinho training with Brazilian teammates ahead of the international break. Just two days after missing the 4-0 win against Arsenal, the 25-year-old was ready to train for the national team with Brazil saying he is fit to play.
Having sold Neymar to Paris Saint-Germain for £198 million (about $257 million), Barcelona was seeking a replacement. Dembele and Coutinho were the two names put forward as potential candidates. Now, 20-year-old Dembele looks to have been that man, after Barca paid £135 million (about $175 million) for the former Borussia Dortmund man. But Barcelona’s pursuit of Coutinho is far from over. The Catalan club reportedly never viewed Coutinho as Neymar’s replacement, but rather Andres Iniesta’s. The 33-year-old midfielder is gracefully heading into the twilight years of his career, and Barcelona and new manager Ernesto Valverde want Coutinho to be his replacement.

“We hope to present another player before the end of the month,” Robert Fernandez, Barcelona’s technical director,  said. “My intention is for one player to come or maybe two, if possible. I won’t go into names but I admit that the club is working on the possibility of signing new players.”
From being the brightest light in the Liverpool team, Klopp may now find it difficult to find a place for Coutinho in his startling line-up. Few players have begun the season better than Sadio Mane and Roberto Firmino; fewer still have eased into a new team as seamlessly as Mohamed Salah, who moved to Anfield from Roma for £34 million ($44 million) this summer. Mane has three goals in three leagues games, while Firmino and Salah both have two apiece. So who makes way for Coutinho’s return? Liverpool fans also wouldn’t be best pleased with the Brazilian’s desire to leave, with uncertainty surrounding how the supporters would react should Coutinho be in the team for the trip to Manchester City on September 9.


For the neutral, Liverpool’s demolition of Arsenal on Sunday at Anfield was sadly free of much drama.
Sure, there was enjoyment to be had in Liverpool’s blistering attack, somewhere in the hinterland between a saber and a sledgehammer, some diversion in the interplay between Roberto Firmino, Sadio Mane and new signing Mohamed Salah, in the artful muscularity of Emre Can.
And there was the commentary of Gary Neville. Neville, the former Manchester United defender who has become one of English football’s most respected and forensic analysts, rarely tried to hide his distaste for United’s great rival Liverpool during his successful playing career.
On Sunday, though, it was Arsenal’s listless performance that attracted Neville’s ire. Apparently growing increasingly frustrated through a one-sided first half, Neville let fly with some zingers.
"I'm absolutely fuming watching them [Arsenal]. It's ridiculous some of the things you see from them," Neville said on commentary for Sky Sports, as reported by The Telegraph. "I'm not a Liverpool fan but this Arsenal team deserve a battering.
"I'd stick them all up on the transfer list. Some of these Arsenal players want a move. Who would buy them?"
Neville reserved his pithiest remark for Aaron Ramsey, the Arsenal central midfielder who put in a particularly ineffectual performance against Liverpool.
“They took Aaron Ramsey off, which is a shame because he would have been my man of the match… So I could get the post-match interview with him.” Ouch.
Still, it looks as though several Arsenal players will get moves away from Emirates Stadium in the remaining few days of the transfer window. Chelsea has reportedly agreed a fee for Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, while Alexis Sanchez was linked on Tuesday morning with a move to Manchester City. Raheem Sterling could head the other way, though he should be prepared to become the subject of Neville’s brilliantly barbed analysis.


There's an endearing distinctiveness to Conor McGregor's swagger. It's not his strut—chest puffed out, arms half-raised as though anticipating a TSA patdown on his way to the ring. Nor is it his sartorial style—the outsized shades and flashy three-piece suits that call to mind an upwardly mobile loan shark.
No. It's the lower face: the constant, contemptuous gum chewing. The jutting jaw, as solid and tested as a blacksmith's anvil. The lips that don't so much smile as offer an affable warning of lurking menace.
Yes, Conor McGregor is all mouth.
His well-rehearsed swagger had been on obnoxious display for months before the Irishman finally climbed through the ropes at the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas to face Floyd Mayweather Jr. in a Saturday night pay-per-view spectacular that pitted Ultimate Fighting's biggest star against one of boxing's all-time greats.
Even at age 40 and retired for two years, Mayweather cuts a fearsome figure in a boxing ring. He was a perfect 49-0 in his career, having vanquished every notable fighter of his era within his weight class. He had nothing to prove against McGregor, but the promise of a $100 million payday to fight a non-boxer was too much to resist for a man who, according to Forbes, may owe $30 million in taxes. (That’s what McGregor took home for his efforts Saturday night.)
To serious fight fans and more than a few medical professionals, this woeful mismatch threatened to be a Saturday night massacre.
What McGregor lacked in boxing credentials he made up for in showmanship. During the prefight publicity routine he goaded Mayweather with gusto. "I'm a 170-pound Irish gorilla," he announced. "I'm going to rip his head off and play football with it."
But as Harambe found, even exceedingly popular gorillas can be felled by ruthless marksmen.
All weekend, the Las Vegas Strip was awash with McGregor fans, many with tricolor Irish flags draped around their necks, and even more sporting faces reddened by triple-digit temperatures—such that the Irish seldom experience outside a crematorium. Few had tickets to the main attraction, and most didn't seem to care. McGregor is one of their own made good, a man who literally fought his way out of Dublin's inner city and is loudly fuckin’ proud of it—as are his fans, who came to Vegas for the spectacle, even if they had to enjoy it at casino viewing parties rather than at T-Mobile Arena, where even $10,000 couldn't buy them a seat close enough to hear cheekbones breaking.
The mobs of over-served fans roaming the Strip while their hero was facing certain defeat made it a good bet that the night's most competitive fights would be seen on closed-circuit security cameras rather than pay-per-view. Yet the vibe remained good-humored before the main event. Local Vegas TV news shows surrounded the visitors, every one of whom confidently predicted a McGregor victory, albeit offering no support for this position other than his Irish passport. (This easy sentimentality—and whiskey—may explain why my people have never had an empire.)
"He's the king, and kings have an army. That's us!" said one fan outside the arena, his arms finding support on the shoulders of his equally enthusiastic friends. Up and down the Strip that army marched, all in green but none camouflaged. Many of its soldiers, the men and the women, looked as though they'd had plenty of experience landing punches.
McGregor's arrival in the arena was met with rapturous cheers by a crowd blind to the inconvenient fact that his credentials as a fighter weren't earned by observing the Marquis of Queensberry's rules. The UFC is like a semiprofessional bar brawl, with many deft and deafening kicks to the head. McGregor isn't the type to defer to English nobility on matters of the fist.
By the time McGregor and Mayweather left their corners for the start of round 1, a large segment of the crowd had convinced itself that an epic upset was in the offing, a delusion fueled by beer and a flurry of early punches from McGregor. But mostly beer.
On several occasions in the early going, the Dubliner openly mocked Mayweather, placing both hands behind his back and sticking out his jaw. That got his devotees hooting gleefully, proving that sport can make even the most jaded of fans happily whistle past the graveyard.
With each toll of the bell for the next round, it became more apparent that McGregor was tiring badly, while his more seasoned opponent hadn't even moved into high gear. Mayweather circled his prey, knowing that all he had to do was wait until even the showmanship was exhausted.
Starting in the fifth round, McGregor adopted a "brokeback boxing" strategy, hugging his opponent tightly to avoid receiving blows to his skull and spleen. Rather like admirers of the owner of the nearby gaudy Trump Casino, it was apparent to all but the most diehard believers than their man was ill-equipped for such proximity to power.
In the last fight of the undercard, Gervonta Davis had defeated Francisco Fonseca, aided by a punch to the back of Fonseca's head. The crowd had furiously jeered the illegal blow, but many of those same folks cheered when McGregor landed similar thumps to the back of Mayweather's head. It was about all their man had left, and they knew it.
By the eighth round, the most feared man in the UFC was scuffling with all the ferocity and accuracy of a middle manager arguing with a colleague at after-work cocktails.
In the 10th round, a fusillade of blows from Mayweather forced the referee to end things. With that TKO, Mayweather improved his record to 50-0, an impressive tally that does not include his numerous assaults against women outside the ropes that have resulted in arrests or citations.
When it was over, McGregor slouched against the ropes, battered and bruised, but still steadier on his feet than most of his supporters. It was, his fans gamely declared, a very respectable performance. In Vegas, the fight game is more about entertainment than sporting achievement, and they had been entertained. Perhaps so too had the many viewers who paid $99 to make this the most lucrative pay-per-view event in history.
That this ludicrous mismatch lasted into the 10th round—and that so many were willing to spend so much to see so little—will inevitably fuel calls for a rematch. It was already on the minds of fans as they wandered into the scorching Nevada night. "They have to fight again!" one tricolor-draped man shouted to no one in particular. "We'll make it UFC rules next time."

There has been a darkness over Stamford Bridge over the last three months, an ominous cloud that made that day in May, when John Terry and Gary Cahill lifted the Premier League trophy, seem like a distant memory. But not on Sunday. No, on Sunday, as Everton traveled to west London, the sky was blue, the sun shone and scorched. Chelsea was red hot. 
Alvaro Morata is excelling in difficult circumstances since moving from Madrid to London for a club record fee this summer. After playing a role in both goals in the 2-0 win over Everton, assisting then scoring, Morata has already shown his potential for the champions. Willian and Pedro caused the Everton back line problems all afternoon, while Cesc Fabregas dictated from midfielder for the hosts. Admittedly, Everton made it look easy for Chelsea. Ronald Koeman’s team, which has hopes of Champions League football next season, struggled to truly worry Antonio Conte’s team. 
Here, Newsweek looks at five things we learned as Chelsea looked back to its title-winning best on Sunday: 
Even though it may not look like it this season, Antonio Conte’s life has gotten easier already this summer. The Italian has had a slight moan about the lack of signings at Stamford Bridge and admitted there were times his future in west London was in doubt. But there were two key reasons why Conte is happier this season, and they were sat behind him at Stamford Bridge on Sunday. Elisabetta Conte, the Chelsea manager’s wife, and their daughter Vittoria have moved to London this summer. “Honestly for sure this season wasn't easy for me about my family, because we decided my wife and my daughter would stay in Italy to allow my daughter to finish school," Conte said in May. They both sat behind the dugout for the Everton match, Conte’s daughter wearing a Chelsea shirt with "Champions 17" on the back. 
Ever since arriving in England, the pressure has been on for Alvaro Morata. With Diego Costa awol and refusing to return to west London, Morata is Chelsea’s main man in attack, a role he has not been used to at either Real Madrid or Juventus. The 24-year-old has shown his potential already, scoring and assisting in his debut against Burnley, but also missing a sitter in the victory over Tottenham at Wembley last weekend. Here, he was surrounded. An Everton back three consisted of Michael Keane, Ashley Williams and Phil Jagielka, covered by a defensive midfield of Idrissa Gueye and Tom Davies. But when the ball spilled out to Cesar Azipilcueta with five minutes remaining of the first half, and the Spaniard whipped in an inviting, arching cross, Morata was unchallenged. He leapt high and directed his header past Jordan Pickford. After setting up Cesc Fabregas for the first goal, Morata already has two assists and two goals to his name at Stamford Bridge. Diego who? 
Everton, so far, has been the surprise package in the transfer window so far this summer. The Merseyside club has backed Ronald Koeman, opening up the purse as wide as can be, sparking talk of whether the Toffees can mount a top-four challenge. But even though the core of the team may be considerably stronger, with Keane in defense, Pickford in goal, plus Sigurdsson and Wayne Rooney supporting the attack, there is still no replacement for Romelu Lukaku. Sandro, signed from Malaga, is an industrious forward but not once did he concern the Chelsea defense. Dominic Calvert-Lewin impressed in the draw with Manchester City last weekend and had a positive cameo here, but he is still only 20 years old. Koeman knows that, and he also knows how much Everton will miss Lukaku. The purse will need to be dipped into further in the next four days if those top-four dreams are to be any more than just that. 
After scoring a stunning goal from 50 yards in the Europa League on Thursday night, Gylfi Sigurdsson’s Premier League debut wasn’t quite so thrilling. The Icelandic midfielder, a club record signing, started on the left of the attack for Everton but barely had any involvement in the game. Everton paid £44 million for his creativity, but he needs the support. The introduction of Calvert-Lewin and Aaron Lennon breathed life into Everton and aided Sigurdsson, but Koeman knows his new star man will need more. 
At Wembley last weekend, Chelsea was dominated by Tottenham while also showing a sense of control. Conte’s team can win ugly; we know that. But, here, with Fabregas back in the line-up, playing at home, Conte put his team out to dominate—and it did just that. Chelsea enjoyed more possession, had 12 more shots than the opposition, and seven more on target. The champion looked back to its best, dynamic and adaptable. The sun is once again shining over Chelsea and Conte. 


José Mourinho has overseen a dominant start to the season for Manchester United in the Premier League.
Mourinho can be pretty happy about United’s prospects for the Champions League, too. In the draw in Nyon, Switzerland, on Thursday evening, United drew Benfica, the Portuguese champions, CSKA Moscow and Basel.
Benfica, as is customary, lost several of its best players this summer. United should be too strong for Basel across both legs, although a trip to Moscow on September 27 presents some difficulty. United has a Premier League game three days later, at home against Crystal Palace.
Tottenham Hotspur was handed undoubtedly the hardest draw of the five English clubs in the competition. Mauricio Pochettino’s team looks the third-strongest in its group, behind Real Madrid and Borussia Dortmund. APOEL Nicosia should provide some relief, although the Cypriots reached the Champions League quarterfinals in 2011-12, where they were beaten 8-2 on aggregate by Real.
Chelsea should make it through Group C, but Antonio Conte’s team has the potential to slip up, perhaps in the away tie against Eusebio Di Francesco’s dangerous A.S. Roma side. Diego Simeone’s Atletico Madrid is competing under a transfer ban and has begun the new La Liga campaign slowly. Chelsea will also have to travel to Qarabag. The Azerbaijanis are competing in the Champions League for the first time in their history.
Manchester City is in Group F, with Shakhtar Donetsk, Napoli and Feyenoord. Napoli can present a dizzying array of attacking talents, and no team will relish a visit to a rocking Stadio San Paolo. Liverpool should finish at least as runners-up in Group E behind Sevilla, provided Jürgen Klopp’s team can avoid calamitous defensive mistakes. Liverpool’s pace and precision in attack, at least, should be more than enough to see off Spartak Moscow and Maribor.


When the dust settled over Comerica Park on Thursday evening, the Detroit Tigers had denied the New York Yankees a series sweep with a 9-6 victory, denting the chances of Joe Girardi’s team catching the Boston Red Sox to win the American League East.
The result, though, is about the last thing anyone is going to remember from Major League Baseball’s wildest game of the season so far.
Five players, both managers and a bench coach were ejected from the game after a bench-clearing brawl that began with a confrontation between Yankees catcher Austin Romine and Tigers slugger Miguel Cabrera.
“Began” here is something of a misnomer, as often seems to be the case in baseball where tensions are allowed to fester and mutate for months between series. MLB.com noted that the Yankees and Tigers began to stew on July 31 when Tommy Kahnle, the Yankees pitcher, hit the Tigers’ Mike Mahtook on the helmet with a fastball. In the next inning, Tigers pitcher Michael Fulmer hit Jacoby Ellsbury.
And so to downtown Detroit, almost a month later, and a demonstration that baseball players have unusually long memories. Fulmer, the starting pitcher for the Tigers, hit Gary Sanchez in the fifth inning, on the hands. Then Kahnle threw a ball behind Cabrera’s back, leading to his immediate ejection. Girardi came stomping out to protest; the Yankees manager, too, was ejected, before Romine and Cabrera began jawing and throwing punches. In the melee that followed, Sanchez appeared to aim punches at Cabrera in the pile, a decision that will almost certainly lead to a multiple-game suspension for the Yankees catcher and sometime Designated Hitter.
That wasn’t even the end of it. After Cabrera and Romine had been ejected, Yankees closing pitcher Dellin Betances struck James McCann in the helmet at 98 miles per hour. Betances and Yankees bench coach Rob Thomson were both ejected. In the eighth inning, Tigers relief pitcher Alex Wilson hit Todd Frazier, leading to his ejection and another clearing of the benches.
It’s just as well, perhaps, that the Yankees and Tigers will not meet again this season.

It is said that God created the world in six days, so Antonio Conte’s request to get two deals over the line at Chelsea by transfer deadline day shouldn’t be too hard.
The  Blues boss is the most active manager in the Premier League as the countdown begins to the window closing on August 31.
Conte wants two more signings to join his  Chelsea squad, but he’s not the only manager still looking to completes deals. Here,  Newsweek  looks at all the news and rumors circling the Premier League transfer market:
Conte, the Italian coach, has grown confident over the club’s chances of capturing  Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain from Arsenal by the time the window closes, according to the  Daily Telegraph. The 24-year-old midfielder’s club has to accept that it will have to sell this summer or face losing him for free next year, the  Daily Mirror says.
But Conte also wants another striker at Chelsea, someone to support summer signing Álvaro Morata. Ever since he moved to Stamford Bridge last summer, Conte has wanted to sign Spanish striker  Fernando Llorente, and now may be the time, according to the  Daily Telegraph. The 32-year-old Swansea City striker has worked with Conte before, during his time at Juventus.
Manchester City has finally given up hope on signing Monaco’s 18-year-old sensation  Kylian Mbappé, according to  The Sun, as the Frenchman looks destined to move to Paris Saint-Germain. City had been willing to spend £150 million (about $176 million) on the signing.

But there may be one more player yet coming through the door at the Etihad Stadium in the next six days. City has not,  The Times says, given up on the signing of West Bromwich Albion defender  Jonny Evans, and will launch a third bid worth £25 million (about $32 million).
Crystal Palace is interested in signing Tottenham Hotspur’s second choice goalkeeper  Michel Vorm, according to the  London Evening Standard. New Palace manager Frank de Boer wants to play a more attractive style of football and sees Vorm, a skillful goalkeeper, as key to that.
And finally, England’s 37-year-old veteran  Robert Green may be back in the Premier League soon. The former West Ham goalkeeper, currently with Leeds, is wanted by newly promoted Huddersfield Town, according to the  Daily Mail.


LeBron James fired off a tweetstorm Thursday, ostensibly about fans burning jerseys, but it all got at something bigger—a double standard in the NBA. 
Players are supposed to be loyal, but teams have no such responsibility, and, in fact, are often lauded for being ruthless in their personnel decisions.
The Cavs star was responding to videos of what seemed to be (more on that in a moment) Boston Celtics fans burning the jersey of Isaiah Thomas, the pint-size superstar who was shipped to Cleveland as part of a blockbuster trade for James’s former teammate, Kyrie Irving. 
Here’s what he posted in a series of five tweets (read from the bottom up):
LeBron James called out fans for burning jerseys in a series of tweets Thursday August 24, 2017.   Twitter/Screenshot/Lebron James (@KingJames)
The whole jersey-burning thing—a played-out trope that should have been played out before it even began—kicked off years ago, back when James departed Cleveland for Miami in 2010 following the infamous broadcast on ESPN dubbed “The Decision.” Fans were legitimately angry and burned Cavs jerseys with James’s name on it. It was probably a bit much, but at least at the time it was somewhat novel. Now, any time a player leaves a team, some jamoke with a lighter rushes to set a shirt on fire. 
As many have pointed out, burning the jersey of a player has become a cheap ploy for folks desperate to go viral. And as James noted, Thomas was traded for Chrisake, meaning he had absolutely no choice in the matter. 
But the fact that anyone could somehow transfer some sort of rage to Thomas gets at an NBA truth—one that the players themselves are increasingly aware of—that we demand loyalty of players, somehow, yet expect none from the franchises. As LeBron put it, players get called “coward” for leaving a team yet when the franchise callously jettisons a player past their prime, it’s just “business.”
The NBA is a business, and the 2017 offseason has, in many ways been defined by players using their power to their advantage. The league is defined by superstars who can increasingly take control of the shape of their careers, something LeBron shone a light on with his choice in 2010. A brief recap of the splashiest moves this offseason: Paul George used his leverage as a top talent to force his way out of Indiana, Chris Paul maneuvered his way to Houston, Jimmy Butler was shipped to Minnesota, Gordon Hayward signed with the Celtics and, finally, Irving demanded out of Cleveland and ended up in Boston. Most, if not all, of those moves were initiated by the star players indicating they wanted something new. 
The players—the roughly top 20 players in the league, at least—have more power than ever and they’re using it. Good! They’re already not getting paid what they’re worth because of an arbitrary maximum salary limit, they should at the very least be permitted to play in the circumstances they prefer. The NBA is a massive $8 billion business that’s growing largely because of its best players.
Those players are not without obligations: Their job is to be very good at basketball, but not to be very good at basketball for one team forever-and-ever, amen. Loyalty is great—but it’s a two-way street. Consider that Thomas was traded at all (and briefly forget the idiocy of burning his jersey for that fact). The 5-foot-9-inch point guard was a sports god in Boston, as beloved as any athlete since the Red Sox’s David Ortiz. The Ringer’s Editor-in-Chief Bill Simmons (and the most famous Boston sports guy) put it like this on his podcast immediately following the trade: 
“Isaiah Thomas, who becomes a folk hero in Boston—every kid under age 15 has his jersey, he has this unbelievable season, he’s an MVP candidate last season, he gets hurt, he plays hurt in the playoffs, has a tragic death of his sister, plays through it anyway, we go through an emotional roller-coaster ride, they finally shut him down in round three, bled Celtic green.... Now he’s gone. We have to start there, right? That’s the biggest thing in all this.”
If a team can unceremoniously dump someone who meant so much to the franchise then it’s preposterous to expect players to feel any real sense of loyalty. 
It’s nonsense that we—the royal we referring to fans, Twitter trolls, blowhards on TV—get all bent out of shape when players leave but hardly ever direct our anger so fiercely at franchises for, say, not creating a team with a modicum of hope of winning a championship. In a reasonable world, we wouldn’t get mad at players who did an amazing job then decided to do that job somewhere else. No, in a reasonable world, if there must be ritual burnings, Knicks fans would be sewing together makeshift James Dolan jerseys and blazing those suckers in perpetuity. 


On Sunday afternoon, Manchester United’s Twitter account posted an image of Zlatan Ibrahimovic smiling, dressed in the Red Devils’ new kit. “He’s not finished yet,” the post said, as it announced his new deal.  
Ibrahimovic is returning to  Old Trafford on a one-year contract, teaming up with Romelu Lukaku, Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial in  Jose Mourinho’s lethal attack.
He is an ominous addition to the squad.  United is the early frontrunner in the top tier of English football, winning both the opening two games of the season 4-0, against West Ham and Swansea. Already tipped for the title, Ibrahimovic’s return has enthused  Manchester United fans even further. How could it be beaten now?
But this season will be different for the 35-year-old Swede. He was the savior last season for  Mourinho and his men, scoring 28 goals for United that took the team to three trophies—the Community Shield, League Cup and Europa League.
Now, he’s not the main man up front. Manchester United spent £75 million (about $98 million) to bring Lukaku to Old Trafford from Everton this summer, and he is already repaying the faith, having scored three times in the opening two games.

And here, the questions begin to arise. Will Ibrahimovic and Lukaku play together? No, probably not, given the similarity in style and Mourinho’s preference for one striker in his team. Will they share the role then? Again, it’s unlikely given the Belgian’s start to the season and his desire to be the main man at Old Trafford.
So, how does Ibrahimovic react to spending the majority of the season on the bench? Does he mentor Lukaku, the lion raising a young cub, or will this leave him disgruntled? The "great" Ibrahimovic, who has been the star everywhere he has gone, sat watching from the sidelines.
There was, of course, one club where the Swede was not the focal point of the team. Under Pep Guardiola at Barcelona, the team was built around Lionel Messi, and it didn’t end well for Ibrahimovic and Guardiola’s relationship.
“You bought a Ferrari and drove it like a Fiat,” the striker said of his former manager. With Ibrahimovic turning 36 in October, will United be able to manage him into a purring, classic car or will his presence bring the Mourinho machine crashing to a halt? 


Let me tell you a bit about the course where I learned—taught myself, really—to play golf during my high school years.
It cost 10 bucks to play—that is, if you didn’t sneak on the property through a clearing in the woods behind the green on No. 2. There was a pond on the course, but it was fenced off and seemed to function as a water-treatment plant rather than a trap for golfers. Your ball was sooner to be impeded by a drained bottle of Smirnoff than a sand trap. Basketball shorts, T-shirts, a cut-sleeve polo—you read that correctly, a cut-sleeve polo—were all considered golfing attire. I've since graduated to nicer but still modest public courses that will run you anywhere from $25 to $75 to play. But even those are a far cry from the manicured lawns of Liberty National, a luxe,  uber-exclusive golf club that cost $250 million to build in Jersey City, New Jersey, that I was given a chance to play before it hosts the best professional golfers in the world for the Presidents Cup next month.
Golfing is seen as a hobby for old, rich (largely white) dudes—data shows more than a quarter of all hobbyist golfers make at least $125,000 and the average (average!) PGA Tour viewer is 64 years old—but my retort to this typically is: It doesn’t have to be. If it’s possible for there to be an Average Joe golfer, I’m him. I play on the weekends with normal folks, using gear I bought refurbished or on sale. I’m aggressively mediocre at the sport—I don’t really track my handicap but shoot anywhere from an 85 to a 100 on a typical 18 holes—but enjoy the challenge of the game and the peace of getting outside. And I’d argue there is no feeling in sport as pure as the poetic joy of visualizing a shot, then having your body somehow make it happen. It doesn't hurt that while you do that, you can also drive around carts and drink beer with friends in the sunshine for four hours or so. 
But this all kind of goes to say that Liberty National, which boasts sweeping, panoramic views of the Manhattan skyline and the Statue of Liberty, is way outside my norm. I’m obsessive about the game and watch the PGA Tour relentlessly, but that was a golf world sort of separate from the one in which I existed. But I found myself there to play a round alongside other media members and corporate sponsors and honestly, I was nervous. I hadn’t golfed all summer before I got the invite last week and was able to squeeze in just one practice round. I’d be going in cold and completely unaware of what to expect. Liberty National, in its normal state, was already nicer than any course I’ve ever played or will likely ever play again. To make matters more frightening, I was playing it as it was in the process of getting revamped for the top golfers around the world, meaning narrower fairways, greens as smooth as glass and greater distances to travel to get to the hole. It was a beautiful, difficult course with the volume turned up to 11. So I felt a bit like a fraud as I rolled into the Cadillac-laden valet area in an Uber and attended a press conference before the golfing portion of the day began.

I attempted to calm myself at the driving range—equipped with pristine Bermuda grass and pearly white Titlist Pro V1 practice balls—but I flubbed shot after shot, barely able to lift the ball off the ground. I did that thing where you feign frustration and mutter soft-but-not-too-soft grievances like “God, what is happening,” in an attempt to let people nearby know you’re not this terrible despite knowing in your heart you’re precisely that terrible. My hands were slick with sweat. I’m not really sure why I was so nervous, but it felt like it had something to do with getting laughed off the course, discovered as a guy who definitely didn’t belong.
But off the range and sitting in a golf cart with my playing partner, an editor at NJ.com, I was relieved to learn we’d be playing a shamble-style round, which meant myself, my partner and a third player in a different cart would each tee off at every hole and then the three of us would complete the hole from the spot where the best of the three tee-shots landed. So basically as long as one of us started the hole decently, we’d be okay. I was also relieved to learn we’d be playing from the member tees and not the tournament tees, which effectively meant my shots wouldn’t have to travel as far as, say, world No. 3 Jordan Spieth might hit them. (Side note: Spieth happened to start a practice round at Liberty National during the aforementioned press events, and I can confirm he absolutely bombed his shot.)

My group started the day on Liberty National’s signature hole, which will be hole No. 10 when the pros play the Presidents Cup. It’s a short par 3—meaning it should take three shots to complete—set to the backdrop of the Manhattan skyline and the Statue of Liberty shimmering above the Hudson River. I nervously clutched my pitching wedge, took an exaggeratedly deep breath, addressed my ball and promptly shanked that sonuvabitch about 15 feet into a dense swampy area.  Shit. I three putted from where the best shot ended up, just off the green. So, by the weird, modified rules, I ended up with a very fake bogey. All the while I took diligent notes on what happened on each shot, which proved to be the beginning of a very embarrassing document.
I tried to clear my mind before heading into the second hole. Our caddie, a supremely helpful young man named Davis, suggested an aiming on the 423-yard par 4. I pulled out my driver then clunked my shot off the heel of the club. I cringed as my ball clanked off a half-built riser—presumably where fans will watch the pros launch much better shots—no more than 15 yards away. I took a six on the hole.
It wasn’t until the fourth hole that I managed to hit a decent shot, when somehow my drive was the best out of the group’s three attempts. I wasn’t sure, exactly, what I did to correct my swing but felt a brief pang of joy that I didn’t completely suck. That didn’t last. I lined up my next shot from the fairway and hit the ball directly into the trees.
At this point, most of my fears about the day are coming true. I looked at Davis—who, throughout my struggles, displayed the patience of a monk who received total consciousness—and I felt like a fraud. He kindly doled out tidbits of advice—how far left to aim putts or how much to correct for wind gusts—but I couldn’t help but wonder if he was thinking all the while, “What the hell is this jabroni doing here, last week I caddied for Ray Romano, goddamn it.”
My notes for the fifth hole read, “Almost killed Davis.” I hit a screaming line drive off the tee of the par 4. Davis stood off to the side of the fairway so he could spot where our groups’ shots landed. My ball whistled directly at Davis’s head, and he stared it down like Neo stopping bullets in The Matrix. Panicked, I shouted, “HEADS UP, DAVIS HEADS UP,” somehow forgetting in golf you yell “Fore!” to alert folks of an errant drive. At the last second, Davis sidestepped the little white projectile. Behind me, a crew laughed as they set up what appeared to be a television set. Davis later told me he saw it all along, but I’m not sure if I believe him. I bogeyed the hole. 

I stooge my way through a third of my round before, weirdly, despite my struggles, I started to realize that I could potentially hack my way through the course. Sure, the margin for error was thinner, and a small mistake on the course was amplified, but everything was so nicely maintained—the fairways could pass as greens—that you don’t have to deal with some of the randomness of an average course. On my typical public course, any given shot might bounce off a stray rock, sink into muddy grass, take a weird roll on a shoddy green, or run up against any number of weird chance encounters. Liberty National was like playing on a clean, perfect slate—it was difficult but remarkably fair, a stern but even-keeled judge.
By the 11th hole I again feared I had physically harmed a human being with my utter lack of ability to do anything right. I hit an errant shot toward a crew constructing bleachers. At the same time my ball was set to land, a metallic ping  rang out and I briefly thought I hit a guy. Luckily, after hearing a few more pings, I ascertained it was just a hammer. I finished the hole 14 shots over par for the day.
It was about here I felt free, not even embarrassed. Both of my playing partners had hit some bad shots as well, which selfishly made me feel better. But I also realized that unless journalism starts paying a lot—and I mean A. LOT.—better, than I might never get the chance to play at a country club like Liberty National again. I decided I was going to soak it in.
The 14th hole my notes simply read: “Utter collapse.”
The 15th hole I hit a nice drive.

In an almost cruel fashion, the 17th and 18th holes remind me why I torture myself by playing golf. I have a theory about the game: One good hole a day is what keeps everyone coming back. All it takes is piecing it all together one time out of 18 attempts to make you pay to play again the next weekend.
I hit a perfect drive on 17, and my playing partner cried out, “Shot of the day!” then told me, as I went to take notes, that it was “inspired by Ron.” (His name was Ron, and, Ron, you’re welcome.) The entire group hit their next shot from where my drive ended and I somehow landed my second shot about 15 feet from the hole. I missed my birdie putt but made a God’s honest par, no help from the modified rules necessary. I immediately started thinking about playing the next weekend, albeit at a much cheaper course that wouldn’t stop me at the gate on any day besides media day.
On the final hole, I again bombed my drive. It was a par 5 and I decided to attempt to hit my second shot about 220 yards over a massive pond to the green instead of taking a safer option. I asked Davis how dumb my plan was. “You didn't come here to lay up,” he helpfully pointed out. I smashed my ball past the green. Pure euphoria. It took me three shots to end with a par, but I somehow finished the day looking like I kind of knew what the hell I was doing.
For the day my score was a 92, which sounds like it falls directly in my normal range, but considering there were modified rules that made things much, much easier it was pretty abysmal. But as I picked my ball out of the cup on the final hole, I realized I just spent a day of “work” duffing my way around an incredibly fancy golf course. Not half bad.

I was expecting the golf course to be nice—and of course, it was. But it felt like a different experience entirely from my normal golf routine. Hell, I’d never even had a caddie before.
There were the obvious differences due to the simple fact that the place was gearing up to host an international golf competition. Liberty National was effectively in the process of building what amounts to a miniature city of risers, stands, sponsor tents and luxury boxes.  
But the most surprising thing about being a normal guy at an event held at a course for the uber-rich: Everything was free. A bar serving specialty Grey Goose cocktails handed out not just free drinks and free hats but also free bottles of Grey Goose. A pizza truck gave away slices. Golf carts came pre-equipped with hats, balls and a nametag. A rest-stop house halfway through the course was stocked with beer, sodas, Gatorade and snacks. Lacoste handed out gift cards like Halloween candy.
Keeping with that theme, the organizers issued a challenge for what will be the opening tee of the Presidents Cup in September. Any player at media day whose tee-shot found the fairway would be allowed to take home any polo shirt from the course's shop for free. The hole is a par 4 with a narrow fairway lined on the left by a man-made pond and on the right by thick rough grass. It was the same tee shot that Jordan Spieth crushed down the center of the fairway—oh, and, in case this isn’t incredibly obvious I don’t often see the best golfer in the world when I go golf.  My drive didn’t rival Spieth’s, although at first it looked all right, but then quickly took a hard left turn toward the wet stuff.  Splunk.
I was curious about the free polo I didn’t win, so after I finished my round, I walked back to the club house. It’s a term that conjures images of quaint cottages, but at Liberty National means a sleek, multifloor glass structure. Passing through the bar area, I wandered into the pro shop, found a shirt and turned over the tag. There were no list prices, which let me know they were out of my price range. Heading out of the clubhouse, I saw folks in the lobby passing out more gift bags ahead of a reception later that night. But I had to go to ensure I caught a ferry back to the city before they stopped running.
I hailed an Uber. My driver arrived in a Ford Focus, and as we rumbled down the long path out of the complex she gazed out at the clubhouse. “This is a golf course?” she asked incredulously. 
“Yeah,” I answered. “I usually can't afford to play here.”


Although it would pull the average age of the Cavaliers up considerably, Cleveland may have found a way to ensure LeBron James’ services past 2018.
James, as is well known by now, has the option to skip town next summer, to opt out of his contract with  Cleveland and join a new team. It remains unclear whether or not James is considering that option.
But there are reports that he is unhappy in Cleveland. After losing the NBA Finals to Golden State Warriors, he saw General Manager David Griffin get fired and  Kyrie Irving get traded to the Celtics.  Isaiah Thomas came the other way from Boston, but James is yet to acknowledge his new teammate.
But there is one way in which new General Manager Koby Altman could help secure James’ future at the Quicken Loans Arena, according to reports. Joe Vardon of Cleveland.com says that James wants to join forces with Dwyane Wade again.

“As of right now, people close to James are fairly confident that, at some point this year, Dwyane Wade is going to end up on the Cavs,” Vardon said on ‘The Wine and Gold Talk Podcast’.
“If Dwyane is healthy and he and LeBron are playing great together and they go on this crazy playoff run, that matters,” he added, referring to James’ decision on whether to stay at the Cavs next summer.

James played with Wade while with the Miami Heat from 2010 through 2014, where the duo won two championships together and reached the NBA Finals each year.
Although there would certainly be experience in the team, at 35 years old Wade would be a player for the here and now. But that may be exactly what the Cavs need right now.


LeBron James has a lot of things on his mind: basketball, businesses and organizing the greatest children’s birthday parties known to man.
So perhaps the NBA star has just forgotten to say a public hello and welcome and all that polite, friendly, essentially meaningless stuff to Isaiah Thomas.
Thomas arrived as a Cleveland Cavalier earlier this week in a blockbuster trade with the Boston Celtics for Kyrie Irving, the man James has described before as a “little brother.”
James has tweeted about Irving since the trade: On Wednesday he urged Cavaliers fans to respect “the kid” Irving for his work in Cleveland, which included helping James to the franchise’s first-ever NBA Championship.
But “The King” has posted nothing about Thomas, the All-Star point guard expected to pick up where Irving left off and then some, by piloting the Cavaliers to another championship. Not on Twitter, where James has posted just once since August 23 about Nike’s Air Zooms. Not on Instagram, where James has posted videos of himself working out in Los Angeles with Cavaliers staff.
Indeed, James hasn’t spoken publicly since the trade, and Cleveland.com has noted he is “keeping mum” on Thomas.
His silence almost certainly doesn’t mean much, of course. James is busy preparing for the new NBA season which begins in October. If anything, he should be pleased that the Cavaliers have got such good value for a player whose desire to be traded was such public knowledge. In addition to Thomas, whose statistics from last season match up very well to Irving’s, the Cavaliers received a first-round draft pick in 2018, Ante Zizic and Jae Crowder.
The longer James goes without saying anything about Thomas, though, the more people are going to talk. Like it or not, James has a new sidekick and he is going to have to acknowledge him soon.


Paul Pogba has warned the rest of the Premier League that Manchester United is not “scared of anyone” and is capable of winning the title this season, according to reports.
Jose Mourinho’s team is the early front-runner in English football’s top division, winning both its first two games of the season 4-0 and sitting top of the  Premier League table.
Pogba, who joined the team last summer for a then-world record £90 million (about $115 million), believes  United is now capable of winning the title for the first time since Sir Alex Ferguson retired.
“I'm pleased and happy that we have started really well, but it is not finished yet,” Pogba told  ESPN. "It is just the start of the season.
“The biggest challengers? We are our own rivals and we think about ourselves first. But we don't have to be scared of anyone in the league because we know we are a strong team as well. We know we can do great this season.
“I hope [we can win the title]. Every team is strong, like when Leicester won it two years ago and nobody expected it, so you don't know what's going to happen.”

United’s ominous start to the season has been partly down to Pogba’s impressive performances: Scoring in the first two games, against West Ham and Swansea, as well as adding an assist.
The signing earlier this summer of £40 million (about $51 million) midfielder Nemanja Matic, from Chelsea, has helped ease the defensive duties on Pogba.
“That helps me more be myself,” the 24-year-old said. “I still do the defensive part, but now I can go forward more and help the strikers. I like to be in front of the goals, too.”


Arsene Wenger has publicly reminded Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain of the “time and money” Arsenal has invested in him amid reports of a £35 million (about $45 million) bid from Chelsea.
Antonio Conte, the  Chelsea manager, is looking to bring in a few more signings before the transfer window closes on August 31, and  Oxlade-Chamberlain is high on his list.
The Italian coach sees Oxlade-Chamberlain’s versatility as meaning he would be capable of playing in the wing-back position. But Wenger, who signed the 24-year-old midfielder from Southampton in 2011 for £12 million, wants him to consider the effort  Arsenal has put into his career.
“I want to keep my best players—my only target is to keep everyone on board,” Wenger said, as quoted by the  Daily Mail. “We've invested time and money and confidence on players like Ox and they have a responsibility. I hope he commits.
“I want him to stay at the club and be one of the big players of the future. He is one of the players we want to build around in the future. He will be a big player in this country.  
“I've had to deal with big departures many times, and I always focus on the team and Arsenal. Of course you want to keep your best players, but you have to find a way to survive.”
Related:   Even British Police Are Mocking Arsenal on Twitter Now
Oxlade-Chamberlain featured in Arsenal’s FA Cup final win over Chelsea in May, as well as the Community Shield victory at Wembley earlier this month. But the Englishman is in the final year of his contract at the Emirates Stadium.
Should Arsenal fail to get him to sign a new deal by January, he will be free to speak to any club he wishes in January and sign a pre-contract agreement, leaving north London for free next summer.
Alexis Sanchez, the Chilean forward, is in the same position at Arsenal, and Wenger is desperate not to lose his star players. In 2012, Robin van Persie left Arsenal for Manchester United and won the title the following season.
The possibility of that happening again would be far too painful for Wenger. Pulling on the heartstrings of his players now may be desperate but may just work.  


The basketball world saw another sensational trade this week when Kyrie Irving got his wish, to leave Cleveland for Boston, while Isaiah Thomas went the other way.
Irving issued a trade request earlier this summer, with reports that the point guard wanted to escape the giant shadow of  LeBron James, to be the star of a team.
Many saw Cavs as getting a good deal.  Irving may have asked to leave, but in Thomas new General Manager  Koby Altman now has one of the NBA’s elite scoring point guards. Not a bad start to life in the hot seat.
But things could have been very different had  Cleveland had its way. According to Marc J. Spears of  The Undefeated, Altman put in a call to Cavs' biggest rival Golden State Warriors before completing the deal, inquiring about the possibility of trading Klay Thompson; there was no interest.

Thompson has heard the rumors, and says he is flattered but mainly reassured. “It's really cool. It shows the Warriors believe in me and these other teams want me to be a part of their success. So I appreciate it,” he told  The Athletic.
“I've been in trade rumors forever. Everyone has. Except for maybe LeBron James, Steph [Curry]—well, even Steph early in his career.”
He added: “It's part of the business. It is flattering and I do appreciate it.”
Related:   LeBron James Misunderstanding Led to Kyrie Irving’s Trade Request at Cavs
Meanwhile, as Cavs say goodbye to Irving, James has urged fans to do so in the right, respectable way. Replying to a video on Twitter of a fan thanking Irving, James wrote: “That’s the only way to be to the kid! Special talent/guy! Nothing but respect and what a ride it was our 3 years together.”


In a summer when the lid has consistently threatened to blow off the transfer market, perhaps the most combustible deal is yet to come.
Cristiano Ronaldo began the season with his own explosion: a substitute’s appearance against Barcelona in the Spanish Super Cup that included a superlative long-range goal, a red card and a push of the referee that resulted in a five-game ban he called “incomprehensible.”
Ronaldo rarely seems entirely happy at Real Madrid, of course, perhaps not helped by the fact he is still jeered by sections of the club’s support at the Santiago Bernabeu, despite eight years at the club.
That apparent animosity has led to frequent reports linking Ronaldo with a transfer away from the Spanish capital. The latest comes from Spanish newspaper El Pais and the Daily Mirror, which claims there is “uncertainty” over Ronaldo’s future at Real.
There is reportedly a chance that Ronaldo could leave Real before the end of this summer transfer window, as he has become “angry” at the length of his current ban. If that came to pass then Manchester United, Ronaldo’s former club, would likely go back in to sign the player it lost for a then-world-record transfer fee in the summer of 2009.
“For now, he’s [Ronaldo] just concentrating on playing,” The Mirror quoted a source described as “close to Ronaldo” as saying.
“He is angry about the five-game ban, but he is working just as hard with the team.
“We’ll see what happens in between now and August 31.”
A transfer appears highly unlikely, not least because the summer of 2017 has seen Real move definitively ahead of Barcelona due to the latter’s loss of Neymar to Paris Saint-Germain. The departure of Ronaldo, especially so late in the transfer window, could redress the imbalance.
However, it’s also worth pointing out the enduring mutual love and appreciation between Ronaldo and United and its supporters. Despite Ronaldo’s progression at Real into one of the finest footballers of all time, the sense persists that Old Trafford is the venue to which he belonged best. Perhaps those emotional ties could yet lead to the biggest transfer of an already overheated summer.


Just one week remains for Premier League clubs to complete last-minute business in the transfer window.
After August 31, the opportunity will be closed for four months, until January, so there is quite a bit of speculation around this morning about comings and goings.
Here,  Newsweek  guides you through all the news, rumors and whispers swirling around the Premier League:
Chelsea has been rocked as  The Times reports that Barcelona will make a late bid for 29-year-old Brazilian winger  Willian, who has been the best player for Antonio Conte’s team so far this season.
But  Chelsea is trying to complete some deals of its own. According to the  Daily Telegraph,  Conte’s team has made a new £35 million bid for Arsenal winger  Alex Oxlade Chamberlain. The 24-year-old is in the final year of his contract at the Emirates Stadium.
Chamberlain is not the only Arsenal player of interest to clubs. Italian team Inter Milan has made an offer for German defender  Shkodran Mustafi, planning a season-long loan with a view to a £20 million deal the following season, the  Daily Mirror says.
After completing the signing of center back  Davinson Sanchez and goalkeeper  Paulo Gazzaniga, Tottenham is considering some more deals before the window closes. According to  TalkSport, Mauricio Pochettino’s team is preparing a new offer for Lazio forward  Keita Balde Diao, a player also linked with a move to Juventus.
Related:   The Four Major Issues Chelsea Must Address Before Transfer Deadline Day
The  same newspaper also says that  Jonny Evans’ move to Manchester City from West Brom looks likely to be completed next week, with a fee in the region of £30 million.
West Ham is considering a bid for Sunderland midfielder  Didier Ndong, according to the  Sunderland Echo, but Slaven Bilic’s team is yet to make an offer for the 23-year-old.
If you thought the Neymar deal was big, there is potential for this summer to go even bigger. According to  The Sun,  Lionel Messi’s father has been in talks with Manchester City about a potential move from Barcelona this summer.
And finally, former Liverpool goalkeeper  Pepe Reina could be on his way from Italy to France. The 34-year-old Napoli goalkeeper is wanted by Paris Saint Germain, according to  AS.


Liverpool playmaker Philippe Coutinho is considering releasing a public statement about his desire to leave Anfield for Barcelona, according to reports.
The Brazilian midfielder has been the subject of interest from  Barcelona ever since it sold Neymar to Paris Saint Germain for £198 million (about $251 million).
Coutinho has been at the top of the Catalan club’s wish list, and it has been willing to pay great sums to see him move to the Camp Nou.
On Wednesday, it was reported that Barcelona was preparing a £136 million (about $174 million) bid for  Coutinho. But, before  Liverpool even received the offer, it had reportedly got in contact with Barcelona and told the club it would not even sell for £150 million ($192 million).
Coutinho has already handed in a transfer request but Liverpool bosses have insisted they are not willing to sell the Brazilian, and he will respect his contract.
Related:   The Massive Transfer Weaknesses Liverpool Must Address Before Deadline Day
So, according to  Yahoo Sports, Coutinho could now put pen to paper, making a public statement to explain his discontent at Liverpool that would, in his eyes, hopefully push the deal through.
This was a method used by Southampton defender—and Liverpool target—Virgil van Dijk earlier this month. The Dutch defender wants a move away from the St Mary’s but the club has refused to sell, so he wrote a public letter explaining his desire to leave.
Van Dijk, at the moment, remains a Southampton player.


The blockbuster trade that sent Kyrie Irving to the Boston Celtics and Isaiah Thomas to the Cleveland Cavaliers on Tuesday night threw up a bunch of intriguing storylines, now and down the road.
The ultimate, overarching question of who actually wins one of the more eye-opening deals in recent NBA history is going to have to wait for an answer, at least until it becomes clear how badly the Brooklyn Nets are going to tank in the 2017-18 season.
At least we won’t have to wait long for the instant gratification of one narrative: Irving getting traded within the Eastern Conference means he’s going to come into direct contact on a regular basis with LeBron James, the future Hall of Famer whose looming influence over Irving was one major reason for the trade.
TNT is the lucky broadcaster that gets to air the first-ever meeting between James and Irving on opposite sides. The Cavaliers and Celtics get the NBA regular season under way on Tuesday, October 17 at Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland at 8 p.m. EST. Watch TNT will also show a livestream of the game for those watching on a computer or via the TNT app.
Add in the intrigue of Thomas as a Cavalier, and whether he can create anything like the chemistry Irving had with James; the presence of major free-agent acquisition Gordon Hayward on the Celtics; and the fact that this is a repeat of the Eastern Conference finals from 2017 with the Celtics seeking revenge, and the NBA could hardly have wished for a more enticing build-up to the season’s curtain-raiser. The countdown to James versus Irving, Thomas versus the Celtics, Hayward versus the weight of expectation and Irving versus the franchise that pushed him toward greatness starts right about now.


It has become a bizarre, almost sadistic, trend in the NBA world: One of the top players from a team decides to leave, to take up a new challenge elsewhere, and his fans—or former fans—show their fury, their pain.
Sometimes, a jersey with the name of the player on the back is placed on the pavement, doused in fuel and ignited, a symbol of fan feelings—betrayal after being left in favor of another team. It happened when Kevin Durant last year left Oklahoma for Golden State, when Dwight Howard left the Magic and when LeBron James left the Cavs in 2010.
But James, now of course back in Cleveland, has urged Cavs supporters not to do the same as Kyrie Irving departs. The All-Star point guard is heading for the Boston Celtics, with Isaiah Thomas coming the other way.
A Cavs fan posted to Twitter on Tuesday night a video of Irving’s jersey that was reminiscent of those that featured lighters, but this user placed a note on Irving’s top instead. Take a look: 
That&#39;s the only way to be to the kid! Special talent/guy! Nothing but respect and what a ride it was our 3 years together Young Gode #Filayy https://t.co/wKYmYsmdgG

James spotted the video and retweeted it with a message for all Cavs fans to show their appreciation to Irving. “That’s the only way to be to the kid!”  James wrote. “Special talent/guy! Nothing but respect and what a ride it was our 3 years together Young Gode #Filayy”

Of the move, Celtics President Danny Ainge said: “This has obviously been a roller coaster of a day for us, trading away Isaiah and Jae and Ante, especially Isaiah and Jae, who have been such a big part of our team and our success and our Celtic culture as leaders of our team. Very, very difficult day.” 


Tottenham Hotspur is set to beat Manchester United to the signing of Fulham’s teenage sensation Ryan Sessegnon, according to reports.
The 17-year-old, who is capable of playing anywhere on the left side of the pitch, has a few potential suitors in the Premier League, including United,  Spurs and  Jurgen Klopp’s Liverpool.
Sessegnon featured 25 times for the west London club in the Championship last season, and is valued at £25 million (about $32 million) by Fulham.
According to  ESPN, the teenager will snub the advances of  Jose Mourinho’s Manchester United to join  Mauricio Pochettino at  Tottenham in the final days of the summer transfer window.

Mourinho has already spent £150 million (about $192 million) this summer at Old Trafford, strengthening the core of his team. Swedish center back Victor Lindelof was the first through the door, followed by Belgian striker Romelu Lukaku for £75 million (about $98 million).
Serbian midfielder Nemanja Matic was the third and, so far, final signing to arrive in the north west of England, from Chelsea for £40 million. But Mourinho reportedly wants Sessegnon, too.
But there may be more opportunity in north London for the youngster. Tottenham has been one of the lowest spenders in the Premier League so far this summer.

Colombian center back Davinson Sanchez is set to become the club’s first signing, subject to a medical, joining from Ajax for a fee of around £36 million (about $46 million).
Working with  Pochettino will be an attractive prospect for Sessegnon because the Argentine coach has promoted from the Spurs academy frequently since he arrived at the club.
Kyle Walker-Peters, Harry Winks and Josh Onomah, all 21 or younger, benefitted from working with Pochettino and appeared in the Spurs first team last season.


In all the sound and fury and general astonishment at the blockbuster trade that sent Kyrie Irving to the Boston Celtics and Isaiah Thomas the opposite way, to the Cleveland Cavaliers, the two most important protagonists were the quietest of all.
While the Celtics announced the Irving signing on their Twitter account with the message, “Welcome to Boston Kyrie Irving,” the All-Star point guard was silent on social media. Irving made no announcement on Instagram, where he has 9.9 million followers.
On Twitter, Irving’s last post is a retweet from August 7 that now looks a little awkward: It is an announcement that Irving would be the cover star of the videogame NBA 2K18, in his new Cavaliers uniform, of course.
The tweet in reality is probably a lot more awkward for 2K Games than it is for Irving, who has more pressing issues to be worrying about, like acclimatizing to his new surroundings in Boston. NBA 2K18 has a release date of September 19, giving 2K Games a limited window to scramble for another cover—possibly with Irving in the right uniform.
There’s an argument that videogame companies should be prepared for this kind of eventuality, but then, how many people saw Irving being traded within the Eastern Conference, let alone to the Cavaliers’ principal rival in the East? Thomas and Irving trading places actually makes a lot of sense but only post-fact, and if basketball’s soothsayers couldn’t get it right, then 2K Games can’t be expected to be Nostradamus either.
All the same, it might be useful for all parties if Irving broke his social media silence to retweet a few Celtics-related posts, to bump that unavoidable slice of awkwardness down the page a little. Thomas is less of a problem, not being the cover star, but 2K also has to change his uniform in the run-up to the game’s release. Pity the poor videogames developer when franchises decide to pull off mega-trades.
Newsweek has contacted 2K Games for comment.


It is just 94 days since John Terry and Gary Cahill lifted the Premier League trophy at Stamford Bridge. In the process, Antonio Conte became the ninth manager to win the championship in his first season in English football. But, since then, a lot has changed at Chelsea.
Conte’s future at the club has been questioned as he battles with the  Chelsea board over signings. Diego Costa, the team’s prolific striker of last season, is unwanted and awol, refusing to return to London. And despite spending around £150 million (about $192 million) this summer, the Italian coach is far from content.
Conte and  Chelsea have just eight days to make the necessary changes, before the transfer window closes. So, here,  Newsweek  looks at the issues that must be addressed.
Alvaro Morata was Chelsea’s third signing of the summer, brought in from Real Madrid for £60 million and billed as Costa’s successor. The 24-year-old Spaniard has impressed in his first few appearances for the Blues, scoring on his debut against Burnley, but with Chelsea potentially facing 60 games this season he will need some support. Conte doesn’t appear to view Belgian Michy Batshuayi as that man despite the 23-year-old scoring four times in the final three games of the Premier League last season. So maybe someone with more experience? Swansea’s 32-year-old striker Fernando Llorente has been on Conte’s radar since he arrived at Stamford Bridge, having worked with him at Juventus between 2013 and 2015. Jamie Vardy has even been linked with a move to Stamford Bridge. An experienced striker would ease the pressure on Morata.

Although he played a pivotal role from the bench last season, Conte doesn’t appear to see Cesc Fabregas as capable of playing in his team. Fabregas may not possess the intensity Conte demands. With the addition of Tiemoue Bakayoko, Chelsea’s midfield has a formidable presence but could still do with a creative addition. Conte will need options in his squad as he faces playing three games a week with Chelsea returning to the Champions League this season. Leicester’s Danny Drinkwater has been linked with a move to Stamford Bridge, but doesn’t quite have the creative intelligence Fabregas does.

The Premier League season had not even begun when Chelsea first discovered its lack of depth. When the team sheets were announced prior to Chelsea’s defeat to Burnley at Stamford Bridge on August 12, Conte had named Jeremie Boga as one of his forwards. Eden Hazard was still out injured. Pedro was not yet fully recovered. So Chelsea ended up naming a player barely known outside of west London who was born in the same year Tony Blair became the British Prime Minister. Some claimed it was a message from Conte to the board, presenting his lack of depth. He reportedly wants Antonio Candreva from Inter Milan, but is battling with the club to sanction a bid for a player aged 30.
Despite the huge success he has brought to Chelsea, Conte’s position as manager has never quite appeared certain—something he admitted to this summer. Reports in Germany on Wednesday morning even suggested Chelsea was sounding out Thomas Tuchel, the Borussia Dortmund manager, as a potential replacement. There is little certainty around any manager’s future at Stamford Bridge, but Conte will need reassurance and backing. That sunny day in late May, when he lifted the Premier League trophy, already seems a distant memory.


As opening statements in a job go, Koby Altman’s was the equivalent of Bart Simpson smashing all of Springfield’s windows by shouting down a combined 20 megaphones.
On Tuesday, Altman orchestrated one of the more remarkable trades in modern NBA history, moving an All-Star, all-world talent in Kyrie Irving to the Boston Celtics.
In his first major assignment since replacing David Griffin as Cavaliers General Manager, Altman knew he could accept nothing less than a king’s ransom for Irving, who informed the Cavaliers of his desire to leave northeast Ohio in July as he sought success away from the shadow of LeBron James.
He got it, too. In return for Irving, the Cavaliers received one of the NBA’s elite scoring point guards in Isaiah Thomas, small forward Jae Crowder, seven-foot prospect and 2016 first-rounder Ante Zizic and the Brooklyn Nets’ unprotected 2018 first-round pick.
It’s a move of extraordinary chutzpah from Altman and the Cavaliers’ front office, who could have moved Irving west to the Phoenix Suns, say, and not seen much of him again for most of the season. If Irving produces a clutch performance in an Eastern Conference series against the Cavaliers, well, Altman is not going to be very popular.
But the Cavaliers decided that the only appropriate value for Irving lay in the East. Crowder can help them out immediately, Zizic is intriguing and the Nets are almost certainly going to nosedive again so the draft pick is going to be a high one. As Stephen A Smith said on SportsCenter on Tuesday evening, if the Cavaliers lose LeBron James to free agency next summer then the pieces should already be in place to start the rebuild. Thomas, too, becomes an unrestricted free agent next summer.
“You’ve got to love what Cleveland did for itself,” Smith said. “Because remember, in the event that LeBron leaves then you can elect not to pay Isaiah. So you’re getting Isaiah’s numbers off the books, you’re getting LeBron James’ numbers off the books, you’ve still got an anticipated high first-round pick to rebuild and retool. All of those things can potentially work in your favor.”
The Celtics just entered win-right-now mode. The Cavaliers are there already but gave themselves wriggle room for regeneration if the Thomas experiment goes wrong. Altman’s first move was brassy but inspired.


Antonio Conte’s bumpy summer at Chelsea appeared to get a little smoother with a gritty victory over Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday at Wembley.
Or maybe not. 
According to a report in German football magazine SportBild, Chelsea has lost its patience with Conte, who won the Premier League in his first season as a manager in English football.
In the Italian’s place, Chelsea is reportedly keen on appointing Thomas Tuchel, the 43-year-old German manager who spent two years at Borussia Dortmund before leaving the Bundesliga giant in May.
Roman Abramovich, the Chelsea owner, and the Russian billionaire’s senior adviser Marina Granovskaia have decided that Conte’s reign as Chelsea manager has to end after Granovskaia’s relationship with the 48-year-old deteriorated, it claims. Tuchel would be “interested” in the job.
While Conte should have credit in the bank following Chelsea’s title triumph last season, two factors may count against him. Chelsea’s summer has been tumultuous, beginning with a row between Conte and star striker Diego Costa and ending with Costa in exile in Brazil.
Then Chelsea lost 3-2 to Burnley at Stamford Bridge in its first Premier League game of the season, losing two players to red cards in the process. Throughout his 14 years as Chelsea owner, Abramovich has also shown a ruthlessness in dismissing managers. Even Jose Mourinho was not spared the axe, twice, despite being the most successful manager in Chelsea’s recent history.
Tuchel has also won far less than Conte, although of course that may mean he feels he has more to prove than the former Juventus manager.
It would seem an extraordinary decision for Chelsea to dispose of Conte this early, especially given his relationship with the club’s fans. But Abramovich and Granovskaia have little room for sentiment—possibly why Chelsea has remained a consistent winner through consistent upheaval. Even after last season, Conte looks like he may be on borrowed time.


And the countdown continues. Just eight days to go until each Premier League manager will have to make do with the players he has—well, until January anyway.
Over in west London,  Antonio Conte seems the most desperate manager in the division to get deals over the line before the August 31 deadline. His  Chelsea team may be Premier League champion, but the Italian coach is linked with a few high-class players.
On Merseyside,  Jurgen Klopp has the opposite problem. The Liverpool manager cannot wait for the transfer window to close as he desperately looks to keep hold of his most valued, and sought-after players.
Here,  Newsweek  guides you through all the news and rumors in the Premier League with little over a week remaining:
Chelsea has at least three players on its list of targets over the next week, two of which currently play at Leicester City. Conte’s team is closing in on a deal for central midfielder  Danny Drinkwater, which is likely to see a fee of around £30 million (about $38 million), according to the  Daily Mirror, while also considering making a bid for 30-year-old striker  Jamie Vardy.

The  same newspaper also says Chelsea is keen on Italian midfielder  Antonio Candreva, who has been told he can leave Inter Milan for £25 million (about $32 million). The board at Stamford Bridge are not keen on signing players past their peak, however, because there is no sell-on value.
At Anfield, Klopp and Liverpool thought they had seen off Barcelona’s interest in Brazilian playmaker  Philippe Coutinho, but not quite yet, apparently. The Spanish giant will make a fourth and final bid for the 25-year-old in the region of £136 million, according to  The Sun.

Chelsea is not the only London club looking to do some last-minute business. Mauricio Pochettino’s Tottenham is looking to sign Paris Saint Germain defender  Serge Aurier, who has been linked to both Manchester United and Chelsea, according to  Sky Sports.
Manchester City will return to West Bromwich Albion with a second bid for center back  Jonny Evans, a former Manchester United defender, having seen an £18 million offer rejected last week,  ESPN says.
French Ligue 1 club Marseille has confirmed, according to the  Daily Telegraph, that it would be interested in signing Chelsea outcast  Diego Costa this summer if he cannot complete a deal to Atletico Madrid.
Costa, the Spanish striker, is not wanted by Chelsea and his desire is to return to Atletico, his former club.
And finally, Crystal Palace is looking to sign Scottish winger  Oliver Burke from RB Leipzig, according to the  Guardian. The 20-year-old has worked with Palace’s new sporting director Dougie Freeman before, at Nottingham Forest.


“September’s coming soon; I’m pining for the moon,” Michael Stipe sings in R.E.M.’s "Nightswimming," the greatest track at the center of the elegiac masterpiece that is 1992’s Automatic for the People.
Stipe, of course, is mourning the disappearance of summer, or summers long gone, now fading in his memory. “What if there were two,” he goes on, “Side by side in orbit, around the ferrous sun.” We don’t know, of course, but we can glean that he’s wishing for another youth.
Football has its own elegiac side, though the transfer market often appears concerned only with the present and future. Arsene Wenger, for instance, wants September because that will mean the end of the summer transfer window, enabling him to free himself from worries about Alexis Sanchez, his best player.
Wenger has often appeared an unwilling participant in the transfer market, but he hasn’t survived for more than two decades by being a dreamer unable to live within the boundaries of the system. Here are the areas he needs to fix before the window slams shut.
Gabriel Paulista is leaving while Shkodran Mustafi, too, looks like he could be on his way out of Emirates Stadium to Inter Milan. Both of those players have had their faults and weaknesses while at Arsenal but Friday’s first Premier League fixture against Leicester City showed that Wenger cannot go into the new season without replacing them.
While new signing Sead Kolasinac was impressive on the left-hand side of a back three against Leicester, Arsenal’s defense was breached too many times and too often. Nacho Monreal is not the dominant central defender to carry Arsenal to that long-awaited first league title since 2004. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain is not the wing-back to help a team to the Premier League. Hector Bellerin is assuredly not a left-wing back. Against Stoke, Arsenal’s defense looked muddled if not exactly awful. And that confusion, inevitably, filters forward to the rest of the team.
While the rumors and reports about Arsenal making another approach for Julian Draxler could be met with understandable fatigue, a transfer for Paris Saint-Germain’s German forward could actually make sense this time.
Wenger’s preferred system this season is shaping up as a 3-4-2-1 formation with Alexandre Lacazette at the point, supported by two attacking midfielders or “pivots.” Against Leicester Danny Welbeck played in one of those positions alongside Mesut Ozil. But Welbeck is a striker not an attacking midfielder. Arsenal would be exponentially more dangerous if they could team Draxler and Ozil, the two Germany international teammates, together—Ozil the passer and Draxler the dribbler who is adept at finishing, too. It appears that Draxler is available because PSG needs to clear out players after the Neymar transfer. Arsenal should move quickly to snap up an unwanted talent.
The Telegraph reported last week that Sanchez, who missed Arsenal’s victory over Leicester and its defeat at Stoke City, was being lined up by Manchester City for £60 million. The Sun claimed on Tuesday that Arsenal will accept a bid of £70 million from City for Sanchez, who has entered the final season of his current contract at Emirates Stadium.
Losing Sanchez next summer for nothing would clearly not be ideal for Arsenal, but the current state of limbo is arguably more damaging. As in the contemporaneous case of Liverpool and Philippe Coutinho, Arsenal will struggle to spend £70 million in the limited time remaining in the transfer window. Wenger has to stand firm and hold onto Sanchez or Arsenal’s season is going to begin on a discordant note.
Against Leicester, Wenger played Mohamed Elneny and Granit Xhaka as deep-lying central midfielders. Against Stoke, Xhaka played next to Aaron Ramsey, with the Welshman provided license to run forward and support the attack.
Neither combination was entirely convincing. Elneny and Xhaka should have prevented goals; instead Leicester scored three and seemed to play through and over Arsenal with some ease. Against Stoke, Xhaka’s pass towards Ozil never met its intended target, but Jese Rodriguez should not have been allowed to run so far after the mistake to score.
Xhaka is capable of excellence but he needs the right man next to him to bring out his best qualities and stop him having to lunge into tackles. Jose Mourinho went out this summer and bought Paul Pogba a supremely useful lump of granite in Nemanja Matic. Wenger should do the same.


Jurgen Klopp may have received a major fillip ahead of Liverpool’s Champions League second leg against Hoffenheim on Wednesday after a report claimed Philippe Coutinho will be staying at the club this season.
Coutinho has been the subject of several huge bids from Barcelona—which is seeking a replacement for Neymar in the final weeks of the transfer window—the latest reported to be £114 million ($146.5 million), although that apparently included Coutinho winning multiple Champions Leagues with Barcelona.
Liverpool’s response to each approach from Barcelona has been the same: a firm no.
The Guardian reported on Monday that Barcelona was weighing up a fourth offer for Coutinho, 25, who has not featured in either of Liverpool’s two Premier League games so far this season due to injury.
But the Daily Mirror claims Liverpool has “won the battle” to keep Coutinho, with the deadline for Liverpool to accept the latest bid having passed on Sunday. Coutinho signed a new five-year contract in January, and Liverpool is under no pressure to sell. Indeed, a sale at this stage even for upwards of £100 million would make it difficult for Liverpool to find a replacement before the transfer window closes on August 31.
That deadline passing means Barcelona has had to give up on the idea that it can lure Coutinho to the Nou Camp this summer. Instead it will have to look elsewhere as it seeks to spend the world-record £200 million it received from Paris Saint-Germain for Neymar.
The news will come as a relief to Klopp, who is attempting to pilot Liverpool through a tricky Champions League playoff tie against Hoffenheim. Liverpool takes a 2-1 lead back to Anfield on Wednesday night, knowing that victory on aggregate over the two legs will secure it safe and lucrative passage through to the Champions League group stages.


Premier League managers now know the strengths of their teams after two games of the new season, but, more importantly, they also know their weaknesses.
They also know that they have just nine days to fill those holes with new additions before the  Premier League transfer window comes to a close on August 31.
Premier League champion  Chelsea may have shown its grit and mettle at Wembley on Sunday but  Antonio Conte is still desperate for new signings.
Tottenham, which has only made one signing this summer, is also looking to strengthen  Mauricio Pochettino’s team, while Pep Guardiola is looking to add a final polish to his pricey Manchester City squad.
Here,  Newsweek  guides you through all the news and rumors in the Premier League’s transfer market:
Tottenham Hotspur is preparing a £20 million (about $26 million) bid for Everton’s 23-year-old midfielder  Ross Barkley, but Pochettino’s team faces a battle with Chelsea for the Englishman’s signature, according to the  Daily Telegraph. Everton reportedly wants to see a figure closer to £50 million (about $64 million) offered.

The  same newspaper also says that Chelsea is heavily interested in Southampton center back  Virgil van Dijk, and has been all summer. But the St Mary’s club has said the Dutch defender is not for sale and Chelsea will not bid until Southampton says otherwise.
In better news for Conte, 31-year-old midfield target  Claudio Marchisio has revealed that he wants to leave Italian Serie A champion Juventus, according to  TalkSport, leaving an opportunity for Chelsea to bid.

Liverpool may have finally held off Barcelona’s pursuit of  Philippe Coutinho, rejecting a third bid from the Catalan club for the 25-year-old Brazilian playmaker, according to the  Daily Mirror.
Manchester City will turn its attention to signing  Ben Gibson from Middlesbrough if West Brom will not sell Northern Irish center back  Jonny Evans this summer, according to  The Independent. Guardiola’s team is willing to bid £20 million for Gibson, the 24-year-old defender.  
Andy Carroll could yet make a return to St James Park with Newcastle, but it would have to be on a permanent basis, according to the  Newcastle Chronicle. West Ham has ruled out the possibility of loaning out the 28-year-old striker but is open to the possibility of a transfer.
And finally, Paris Saint-Germain is on the verge of agreeing a season-long loan deal for Monaco’s 18-year-old star forward  Kylian Mbappe, according to  Sky Sports.


Le’Veon Bell kept the Steelers sweating his future this summer. But the wait may be over.
Bell has spent most of August in South Florida, skipping preseason training and games for  Pittsburgh while also failing to sign his new $12.1 million franchise tender.
According to  ESPN, the 25-year-old’s teammates expect Bell to be back with them by the time Labor Day comes round, having been in contact with him via text.
But the Steelers may have to go back to the negotiation table to ensure Bell is playing for the team in the coming years.
According to the  Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, Bell wants his salary increased to an average of $15 million a year, significantly north of the $12.1 million the Steelers offered before the summer.

The Steelers have played two preseason games without Bell, beating the Atlanta Falcons on Sunday 17-13 and the Giants 20-12 on August 12.
James Conner, the third-round pick, has started in place of Bell for the Steelers and had 98 yards on 20 carries against Atlanta.


Stoke City was long a bogey team for Arsenal after it was promoted to the Premier League in 2008. Its bullish, direct style contrasted dramatically—and effectively—with Arsenal’s silky football.
But there seemed to be a change over the past few years. As Stoke established itself in the top tier of  English football and looked to play a more aesthetically pleasing style by signing former  Barcelona and Real Madrid players, the results against  Arsenal actually deteriorated.
Since the start of 2015, Stoke has managed to take just one point from five games against  Arsenal. But on Saturday, new signing Jesé scored during his debut at the bet365 Stadium, and Wenger’s team of superstars had no reply.
It was a painful return to north London for Arsenal, made even worse by Stoke’s local police force hitting a zinger on social media. An Arsenal fan with the Twitter handle @TheIwobiEffect tagged the town’s police force and wrote that he “would like to report a robbery,” suggesting the Gunners should have won.

Almost 12 hours later, a reply came from the police account. It read: “apologies for the delay in replying. We’ve been busy looking for a missing person, surname Ozil. Have you seen him? #Banter”
apologies for the delay in replying. We&#39;ve been busy looking for a missing person, surname Ozil. Have you seen him? #Banter
The reply referred to Mesut Özil, the German midfielder Arsenal signed from Real Madrid in 2013 for £42.4 million (about $55 million), who's been criticized for failing to have an impact on big games.
The post got more than 10,000 likes and 8,000 retweets.


Manchester United continued to set the early pace in the Premier League at the weekend as José Mourinho’s side demolished Swansea City for its second 4-0 win in two games.
Elsewhere, Liverpool registered its first victory while Arsenal slipped up at Stoke, and there was a seesaw battle between Tottenham and Chelsea at Wembley in what could be an early preview of the title race.
Who moved up and down the Premier League form ladder? Newsweek assesses the weekend’s action.
Top of the Premier League after two games with eight goals scored and none conceded. United had to bide its time before disposing of Swansea with the same ruthlessness it reserved for West Ham United a week before. Leicester City at Old Trafford on Saturday will be a harder test.
Newcastle was a supine opponent, but this was still an impressive home debut from David Wagner’s team. The victory was more comfortable than the one-goal margin would suggest, although it’s possible that Huddersfield could come to over-rely on the excellent Aaron Mooy. Southampton visits John Smith’s Stadium Saturday at 3 p.m.
Oh ye of little faith who doubt Tony Pulis. Hal Robson-Kanu scored, then got sent off as West Brom pulled off a fine victory at Turf Moor, where Burnley is always strong. Stoke City visits The Hawthorns on Sunday.
All the promise Watford showed against Liverpool on opening weekend was present again at Vitality Stadium, with a first goal for summer signing Richarlison, a screamer from Étienne Capoue and a defensively solid effort. Marco Silva’s team hosts winless Brighton on Saturday.
Mark Hughes’s team did not look like a squad in crisis on Saturday against Arsenal. New signing Jesé Rodriguez took his goal well enough to suggest there may be more to come, too. A visit to West Brom looks a tough test next up in the league.
Antonio Conte’s side was not perfect against Tottenham at Wembley, but it was resilient, and that may be the more important quality right now. Marcos Alonso continues to be perhaps the Premier League’s most underrated full back.
Jürgen Klopp got a win and a clean sheet amid rumblings off the pitch as Barcelona continue to hurl money at Liverpool in a desperate chase for Philippe Coutinho. Liverpool faces Hoffenheim in midweek in the Champions League playoff before an early-season game of huge proportions against Arsenal on Sunday.
City plays Everton Monday night knowing it must win to keep pace with United.
Can Ronald Koeman’s team hang with the best in the league? Here’s an early indication.
Two goals, none conceded against Brighton and two assists for Riyad Mahrez, who now looks like he may remain with Leicester for another season. An injury to striker Jamie Vardy may prove costly in the weeks to come.
Spurs didn’t play badly at Wembley, but nor did Mauricio Pochettino’s team do enough to suggest it can prosper playing 19 games at the home of English football this season. And its terrible run against Chelsea continues.
Yes, Southampton picked up its first win of the season. But it also allowed ten-man West Ham back into the game at St. Mary’s Stadium, losing a 2-0 lead. A Charlie Austin penalty saved the day.
A bump back to earth for Sean Dyche’s team after the opening-weekend heroics against Chelsea. Burnley needs to stay strong at home or it could yet be in trouble.
If Javier Hernández scores regularly, West Ham will be OK, but that first win needs to come soon. Slaven Bilić’s side visits Newcastle United on Saturday in a game that already looms as horribly important for both.
Perhaps Arsène Wenger’s side got a little unlucky at Stoke with a marginal offside call against Alexandre Lacazette and penalty claims that could have been given in its favor. But great teams can override misfortune. Arsenal still seems to have a weak underbelly.
Worrying times for Eddie Howe, who must find a way of converting pretty football into goals. Bournemouth has failed to score in each of its two Premier League fixtures this season, and both have ended in defeat.
Insipid against Huddersfield apart from one Matt Ritchie shot, Newcastle looks a prime candidate to be relegated unless Rafael Benítez is allowed to add to his squad in the final days of the summer transfer window.
Palace moves a place up by virtue mostly of other teams’ ineptitude. There is no shame in losing to Liverpool at Anfield, but two defeats and no goals is not the way Frank de Boer would have wanted the season to begin.
Where are Swansea’s goals going to come from? Tammy Abraham toiled against Manchester United with little service or help. Paul Clement simply must spend all of the Gylfi Sigurðsson money to haul Swansea away from danger.
This looks like a long, hard season for Chris Hughton and his team. A visit to Watford on Saturday means the going gets no easier from here.


Breitbart has issued an apology to German World Cup winner Lukas Podolski after mistaking him for a traveling migrant on a jet ski.
The  article, published Friday, was about Spanish police shutting down a gang that was charging migrants 5,000 euros to travel from Morocco via Gibraltar on jet skis.
But the post was accompanied by a photo of former  Arsenal footballer Podolski, now at  J-League club Vissel Kobe, on the back of a jet ski, taken in 2014 during the World Cup in Brazil.
The error was corrected swiftly, but it was picked up on social media just as quickly.
Breitbart seem to think Lukas Podolski is part of a people smuggling gang on jet-skis... pic.twitter.com/0VmHDk9hi4
Breitbart amended the article with a new image and added a note from the editor.
“Breitbart London wishes to apologise to Mr. Podolski,” it said. “There is no evidence Mr. Podolski is either a migrant gang member, nor being human trafficked. We wish Mr. Podolski well in his recently announced international retirement.”

Podolski has not commented on the error. The 32-year-old played football at Arsenal, in London, from 2012 through 2015. There, he won the FA Cup under French manager Arsène Wenger before moving permanently to Turkish club Galatasaray.
The German played 130 times for his country before announcing his decision to retire this year. He won the World Cup with Germany in 2014, the tournament at which he was photographed in the Breitbart article.


Kyrie Irving’s trade request to Cleveland Cavaliers came after he mistakenly believed LeBron James wanted him out of the team this summer, according to reports.
Irving surprised the basketball world by formally asking  the Cavs to trade him, with many believing that he wanted to get out of  James’ shadow and become the main man elsewhere.
But, according to  Fox’s Chris Broussard, Irving was angered after he thought James wanted him gone to make space for Eric Bledsoe and Paul George in this summer’s draft.
“The final straw as to why he wanted out of Cleveland, or wants out of Cleveland, I’m told the Cavaliers had a deal done heading into the draft. This was reported by Cleveland Scene magazine, no one really picked it up, but I’ve talked to a few people who said it was true,” Broussard said.
This deal, according to Broussard, would have seen  Irving move to Phoenix, with Phoenix sending Bledsoe back to Cleveland as well as the number four pick. Cavaliers would, then, send the number four pick to Indiana for George.
Related:   Kevin Durant Opens Up On Whether LeBron James Should Leave Cavs
“Now, Kyrie Irving finds out about the deal,” Broussard said. “Whether it was from David Griffin telling him after he left or however he found out. But he found out about the deal. And he assumed, he rightly assumed, that there’s no way the Cavaliers are doing this unless LeBron gives consent. That’s why he got mad with LeBron. He thought LeBron was in on it.
“LeBron’s take was more, ‘Look, I’m not trying to trade Kyrie Irving. He’s great. But that’s a heck of a deal—Eric Bledsoe and Paul George. So if you do it, hey, that’s a great deal.’ But Kyrie took it as LeBron wanted him out of there. A few days or a week later that’s when Kyrie made his trade request.”

So could this all be a misunderstanding? Regardless, it seems that the situation has gone too far to be resolved. The problem for Cleveland, however, is that there are some suggestions that James will definitely not be playing for the Cavs by next summer.
Veteran NBA reporter Chris Sheridan claimed last week that James was “100 percent leaving” the Cavs at the end of this season. The relationship with the Cleveland owners, Sheridan said, is beyond repair.


Despite spending in the Premier League reaching more than £1 billion already this summer, some of the biggest deals are yet to go through.
Just 10 days are left for English clubs to do some last-minute business. The majority of these deals have seen protracted stand-offs over the summer, with clubs desperately trying to keep hold of a player who wants to leave.
But for a while, it has become clear how much power footballers themselves now have over their future, rather than their clubs. Here,  Newsweek  guides you through six of the biggest deals that could still happen by August 31:
Diego Costa
The war between Costa and Chelsea went public at the beginning of the season when it was revealed that manager Antonio Conte had told Costa he was not in his plans going forward.
From then, the striker has spent his summer in Brazil and says he will never return to Stamford Bridge, In an interview with the  Daily Mail, the Spaniard criticized Conte as a coach, claiming he lacked “charisma” and said that he only wanted to move back to Atletico Madrid.
Chelsea wants Costa to return to its training base in London and to fitness, because the club wants £50 million (about $64 million) for him. Atletico, according to reports, is willing to pay the price tag but its transfer ban will mean Costa would not play until January.
Philippe Coutinho
The most bizarre of situations has played out with Barcelona’s desperation to make Coutinho the successor to Neymar in Catalonia. After selling Neymar to Paris Saint Germain for a world-record £198 million (about $255 million), Barcelona needs a big statement to come in and the club sees Coutinho as that man.
The La Liga giant is willing to spend £120 million of the Neymar money on Coutinho, but Liverpool is unwilling to accept: Jurgen Klopp deems Coutinho priceless, especially now with just 10 days remaining of the transfer window. Coutinho, though, has handed in a transfer request as he looks to force the move through. Will we ever see him in a Liverpool jersey again? It’s become increasingly unlikely.

Virgil van Dijk
And here’s where Liverpool is on the other side of the table. Klopp wanted Van Dijk to become his first signing of the summer in early June, likely to move to Anfield for £60 million (about $77 million). But then the move reached a snag: Southampton didn’t want to sell. Liverpool ended up apologizing to Southampton and ending its interest in the Dutch center back, officially anyway.
Now, Van Dijk wants to go but Southampton doesn’t want to sell, so what’s the outcome? Just like Coutinho, Van Dijk delivers his transfer request to St Mary’s. But he goes one step further by releasing a statement where he tells fans he wants to leave to progress his career. Liverpool is joined by Chelsea and Manchester City in wanting the defender.
Alexis Sanchez
Abdominal pains have kept Sanchez sidelined at the start of this season, according to Arsenal, but the pain may, in fact, be in his gluteus maximus. Sanchez reportedly wants to leave Arsenal this summer and will not sign a contract extension as he heads into the final year of his contract. But Arsene Wenger is willing to take a big gamble. He will risk Sanchez moving to a rival club next summer, for free, in order to keep him at the Emirates Stadium for just one more season. Manchester City, Chelsea and Bayern Munich are all looking to take the Chilean forward, and they don’t want to wait that long.
Alex Oxlade Chamberlain
Again, like Sanchez, Chamberlain is a player in the final year of his contract. Unlike Sanchez, however, Chamberlain has featured in Arsenal’s first two games of the Premier League season, starring in fact and showing why Chelsea is so determined to sign him. At 23 years of age, the English midfielder is a valuable asset, but Arsenal risks losing him to a Premier League rival. Antonio Conte, his biggest admirer, sees his versatility and wants him to play as a wing-back at Stamford Bridge. The Italian manager wants him this summer, and will hope the deal can be done over the next 10 days.
Danny Rose
Unlike many of the other potential transfers, Rose popped up late in the window. In an interview with  The Sun, the Tottenham left-back said that he was worth more than the north London club paid him. The interview upset Spurs and saw Rose apologize, but that has put other clubs on alert. Manchester United and Chelsea are both willing to give Rose a considerable pay rise to lure him away from north London. Conte sees Rose as a perfect player to play at left wingback, while Jose Mourinho is still in need of an orthodox left-back.


With just 10 days remaining of the transfer window, the Premier League’s biggest clubs are looking to do some last minute business.
In the north west of England,  Jose Mourinho’s early front-runner  Manchester United could get even stronger before the summer window closes. The United manager is considering bringing back an old, popular face to  Old Trafford.
At Arsenal, in north London,  Arsene Wenger is stuck with a predicament. While he would like more signings, the French manager has admitted he needs to sell before he can sign, slimming down his squad before the end of the window.
Here,  Newsweek  guides you through all the news and rumors you need to know in the Premier League’s transfer window:
Manchester United is expected to resign  Zlatan Ibrahimovic as early as next week, according to  ESPN. The 35-year-old Swedish striker is expected to return with a part-coaching role, having been the team’s top scorer last season, but he has now been replaced by 23-year-old Romelu Lukaku.
Ibrahimovic has shown on his social media accounts that he has recovered from the injury sustained at Old Trafford last season:

Arsene Wenger is prepared to offer  Alex Oxlade Chamberlain a new four-year deal worth £125,000-a-week (about $161,000) to keep him from joining Premier League rival Chelsea, according to the  Daily Star. Chamberlain is in the final year of his contract and the 23-year-old midfielder will be free to speak to any club he wants in January.

But Wenger has also revealed he has a problem at the Emirates. The Arsenal manager needs to trim down his giant first-team squad before he can bring in any new signings,  The Independent reports.
West Ham is on the verge of signing 25-year-old midfielder  William Carvalho from Sporting Lisbon, according to  Sky Sports. The midfielder is likely to become the club’s record signing, with Sporting demanding a fee of around £40 million (about $51 million).
Crystal Palace is unlikely to complete the permanent signing of  Mamadou Sakho, the French defender who became a fan-favorite at Selhurst Park in just a few months last season, according to the  Guardian. New manager Frank de Boer says 27-year-old Liverpool center back is too expensive.
And finally, Leicester City players are urging wantaway forward  Riyad Mahrez to remain at the King Power Stadium this summer, according to the  Leicester Mercury. Leicester rejected a £30 million (about $39 million) bid from Roma for Mahrez, as the club wants around £50 million (about $64 million) for the 2016 PFA Player of the Year.


Mauricio Pochettino believes Tottenham is actually stronger than it was last season and insists Wembley Stadium did not play a factor in his team’s 2-1 defeat to Chelsea on Sunday. 
Marcos Alonso scored twice, either side of a Michy Batshuayi own goal, that saw Tottenham’s jinx at Wembley continue, losing the eighth time in 11 games under the arch. Those on social media mocking Spurs’ record pointed out that British boxing heavyweight champion Anthony Joshua had won more times at Wembley than Tottenham. 
But Pochettino insisted that it was not an issue and that he knew why Chelsea won and his team didn’t. “I understand we need to talk [about it], but today the ‘Wembley effect’ is not the reason we lost the game,” Pochettino said. “The team played very well. It’s not fair to blame Wembley, because Wembley for me is one of the best places, if not the best, to play football.”
Tottenham dominated for much of the game, having more than two-thirds of possession and hitting 18 shots to Chelsea’s two. Antonio Conte’s tactics, Pochettino suggested, worked to perfection. 
“It was very clear the idea of Chelsea to contain us and play counter attack, with Willian and [Alvaro] Morata up front,” the Argentine said. “I am only disappointed, I am not frustrated or upset. 
“I am happy to lose in that way, keep working and prepare the team for next week here against Burnley.” 
Chelsea’s two shots on target delivered two goals, with Conte’s makeshift team delivering a performance from “fighters,” without Eden Hazard, Cesc Fàbregas, Gary Cahill and other notable absentees.
“I must be pleased,” Pochettino said. “I want to thank my players, because they showed me great desire, great spirit, great will, great art, great will to fight. I saw today fighters.”


Last weekend, there was a suggestion that Antonio Conte was sending a message to the Chelsea board with his team selection. This week, it was his team that was sending the message. 
Marcos Alonso scored twice to hand Conte and Chelsea their first win of the season, having lost the opening game at Stamford Bridge to Burnley. Alonso hit a perfect free kick in the 24th minute to put the away side ahead, but Spurs looked set to take a point when Michy Batshuayi headed into his own net with his first touch of the game. 
But, as the game opened up, and it looked like either side could win, Chelsea showed why it was Premier League champion. Alonso broke into the penalty and, with two minutes to go, shot hard and low. His shot squirmed under Hugo Lloris and drew Conte into wild celebration. 
Here, Newsweek looks at five things we learned from Tottenham’s first Premier League game at Wembley Stadium: 
Takes Time to Settle In
Tottenham did all it could to make Wembley feel like home. ‘To Do is To Dare’ and ‘The Game is About Glory’, Spurs’ two mottos, were everywhere you looked inside and out of the stadium. Some 67,000 white flags waved from side to side before kick off. And then there was the drum, the dreaded drum (we’ll get to that later). But whatever Tottenham did, this was still Wembley; it still felt like a place in the FA Cup final was up for grabs for the winner. This rented accommodation will become more homely in time, but the Premier League doesn’t allow for much of that. With so many teams in contention for the title, Pochettino’s team will have to bed in quickly. 
We Don’t Like to Bang Out Own Drum
But Spurs, apparently, do. Maybe it was through fear of seeing what happened with West Ham last year, when the east London club moved out of Upton Park and into the London Stadium. The atmosphere was flat, and the results were even worse; Tottenham can’t afford that. So, in the planning for the first Premier League home game at Wembley, someone at Spurs suggested an artificial drum. It boomed across the stadium, intended to raise the volume of the home fans. It brought jeers from the 3,000 away fans packed into the corner of Wembley, and a sense of embarrassment from the majority of fans under the arch. And, in the end, it was highly unnecessary, especially when Tottenham’s equalizer went in. Had the roof been on Wembley, it would have been blown off. 
Conte’s Men Step Up to The Task 
Injuries and ill-discipline has left Antonio Conte well short at the start of this season. Four of his substitutes were aged between 19 and 21, while Tiemoue Bakayoko was rushed back from injury to start the game while six defenders were named in the starting line-up. David Luiz was deployed in midfield, alongside Bakayoko and N’Golo Kane, and was magnificent. The Brazilian put in the all important tackle that set up Alonso’s winner. Up front, Alvaro Morata missed a glorious opportunity in the opening minutes of the game to put Chelsea ahead, but looks a lethal striker. He was bullied at times by Tottenham’s powerful defense. 
Vertonghen Should Have Seen Red 
This being a London derby, played in a venue that felt like home to neither team, there was always going to be a feisty edge to the game. A few bullish challenges went in between these two physically powerful teams, but Jan Vertonghen could—and probably should—have been sent off just five minutes into the second half. The Belgian center back saw the ball get away from him on the half-way line and, in a desperate attempt to get the ball back, he lunged toward Victor Moses. High and reckless, Vertonghen’s studs scraped along Moses’ kneecap, leaving the Chelsea man writhing in pain. Anthony Taylor, the referee, reached for his pocket but produced only a yellow card. It wasn’t too dissimilar to the challenge that saw Chelsea’s Gary Cahill receive a straight red card against Burnley last weekend, and Conte made that clear to fourth official Mike Dean. 
Who Needs Danny Rose, Anyway?
A hand flies up from Jose Mourinho and, possibly, Antonio Conte as well. Rose, the outspoken Spurs defender, has upset his club by telling The Sun newspaper that he deserved more money than he was paid; Mourinho and Conte’s clubs would both be able to offer more. Rose remains sidelined at the start of this season, not due to being disciplined but injury. Pochettino has turned to Ben Davies, and the 24-year-old Welshman has filled in well. His ability to get forward, with a dangerous left boot, has always been his strength; it is the defensive work that has the question marks. But already this season he has shown improvements, with perfectly timed challenges. Pochettino may not want Rose to leave, but he may not be missed too sorely with Davies around. 


After the first week of Premier League games came to a close, managers in each and every team were able to assess the tools at their disposal. They now know what they have and, more importantly, what they need.
In the past week, Premier League champion  Chelsea has frantically searched for new signings after losing the first game of the season 3-2.  Antonio Conte has already made four signings but wants more by August 31.
Last season’s runner-up  Tottenham Hotspur looked to be on the verge of spending its first bit of cash this summer, while  Manchester United and Jose Mourinho contemplated a fourth signing.
Here,  Newsweek  looks back on the biggest transfer news and rumors in the Premier League over the past week:
Manchester United target  Ivan Perisic had a new suitor, with Chelsea reportedly showing interest in the 28-year-old winger. Southampton defender  Virgil van Dijk was also wanted by Conte, with Chelsea willing to bid £50 million. Tottenham was considering making Lazio forward  Keita Balde his first signing of the summer, while  Gylfi Sigurdsson looked set for a move to Everton.
Chelsea was growing confident over the signing of Arsenal midfielder  Alex Oxlade Chamberlain for £35 million, with Conte desperate to strengthen his squad. But one man who wouldn’t be returning to Stamford Bridge was  Diego Costa who said he wanted to move to Atletico Madrid. Liverpool was looking to convince  Philippe Coutinho to stay at Anfield, while Chelsea and Manchester City rivalled Jurgen Klopp for  Van Dijk . The first sign of  Davinson Sanchez signing for Tottenham appeared in the news, with the 21-year-old Colombian defender likely to join from Ajax.

Spurs was in the news again but this time in reference to another defender. Tottenham looked set to hijack Manchester United’s deal with Paris Saint Germain for  Serge Aurier, while Chelsea was preparing a £50 million offer for  Danny Rose. But Conte hadn’t given up on Juventus left back  Alex Sandro nor  Oxlade Chamberlain. West Ham was again looking to spend big as it considered breaking the club record to sign  William Carvalho from Sporting Lisbon.
Chelsea’s move for Spurs defender  Rose was unsuccessful, while Conte would have to pay at least £60 million for  Sandro. Manchester United looked set to bring 35-year-old  Zlatan Ibrahimovic back to Old Trafford, but with the striker set to take up a part-time coaching role. Across town, Manchester City made a shock bid for former United defender  Jonny Evans, who now plays for West Brom. Another name popped up on Spurs wishlist with Celta Vigo midfielder  Pape Cheikh Diop catching Mauricio Pochettino’s eye.
Tottenham was on the verge of completing the deal for 21-year-old center back  Sanchez, while Chelsea had a £63 million offer for  Sandro rejected. Manchester United was determined to sign Inter Milan winger  Perisic, but has only offered £38 million. Chelsea outcast  Diego Costa had a surprise offer from Everton, but only wants a return to Atletico Madrid.


When asked Friday for his reaction to Diego Costa accusing Chelsea of treating him like a “criminal,” Antonio Conte had a striking reaction. The 48-year-old Italian burst out laughing.
In an interview with the  Daily Mail on Monday,  Costa said he would not return to Stamford Bridge this summer and that he wanted a move to his former club, Atlético Madrid. The fallout at  Chelsea came after  Conte allegedly sent Costa a text telling him he would not be in his plans for the future.
“I’m not a criminal! I don’t think it is fair after all I have done to be treated like that,” Costa said. Asked for his reaction to the interview on Friday,  Conte said all he could do was laugh at the situation.
Watch the Italian’s reaction here:

“It’s great, it’s great, it’s great. I prefer to laugh,” Conte said. In the interview,  Costa claimed his Italian manager “lacks charisma” and accused him of blocking contract negotiations in January.

Conte is now without Costa and has signed Álvaro Morata as his replacement. The Spaniard scored and assisted in his debut last weekend, but Chelsea lost 3-2 to Burnley.
On Sunday, Conte’s team travels to Wembley Stadium for a London derby against Tottenham Hotspur, the runner-up to Chelsea in the Premier League last season.


First impressions can often be misleading.
What felt like love, until it wasn't. The cable package you were sure was a good value until you got that first bill. The promise of the Great American Novel that turned out to be hackneyed and contrived. The American President who promised to Make Your Country Great Again and brought division and violence. 
And Paul Pogba and Nemanja Matić? Well, we will have to wait on that one, but the first signs were worryingly promising. Against West Ham United, in Manchester United’s first Premier League game of the season, Matić did all the work Pogba is too creative to want to do on a consistent basis, cleaning up behind him and generally providing a sense of positional awareness that United lacked last season, especially when Marouane Fellaini played next to Pogba.
“I think we [Pogba and Matić] play together very well,” Matić told United’s official website on Friday. “We help each other. I have to say he played good in attack and also helped a lot when we were defending. He always played next to me. We are there on the pitch to fight for each other. We will continue like this, and I’m happy to have him in the team.”
It’s interesting that Matić pointed out Pogba’s defensive contribution, because that isn’t something the Frenchman has often been praised for. Criticisms of Pogba’s defensive awareness seemed justified at times last season, particularly from set pieces.
It is illuminating, though, how quickly inserting a player like Matić into a football team can improve the perception of the players around him. Another complaint about Pogba last season, less fair than the barbs about his defensive game, surrounded the idea that a footballer costing £89 million should be able to perform without players bought specifically to help him out.
It’s a nonsense theory, of course, and the signing of Matić proves it. Mourinho knows that Pogba’s game is at its best when he is allowed to break forward without concern for what is going on behind him. The fourth goal against West Ham, when Pogba strode into an advanced midfield area before unleashing a precise shot past Joe Hart, is the kind of thing Mourinho must have envisaged when he bought Matić.
Initial impressions only. If Matić and Pogba dovetail against Swansea City on Saturday like they did against West Ham, perhaps United supporters will have cause to get giddier.


Real Madrid is could be about to reignite its interest in Manchester United goalkeeper David de Gea by bidding £46 million (about $59 million) for the Spaniard, according to reports.
Zinedine Zidane, the Madrid manager, has decided against the need for more outfield players, cancelling plans to bid for Monaco’s  Kylian Mbappe, according to  The Sun, which means the club can return for  De Gea.
The rise of Marco Asensio, the 21-year-old forward who scored a stunning goal in El Clasico on Wednesday night, has reassured the French manager about his team’s strength in depth.
But Real has long been interested in bringing former Atletico Madrid goalkeeper De Gea back to the Spanish capital and the report says the club is preparing an offer of £46 million.
United puts the 26-year-old’s valuation as considerably higher than that, but Jose Mourinho is believed to have faith in his reserve choice Sertgio Romero should a deal be completed.

Manchester United has, however, only strengthened its squad this summer, with Mourinho spending £150 million during the transfer window on three players in different areas of his team.
Swedish center back Victor Lindelof was the first through the door at Old Trafford, followed by Belgian striker Romelu Lukaku for £75 million. Then, Mourinho pulled off the shock signing of Nemanja Matic, for £40 million from Chelsea, which has significantly bolstered his midfield.
All three featured in United’s Premier League opener against West Ham on Sunday, with Lukaku scoring twice and Matic allowing Paul Pogba license to get forward.
United faces Swansea on Saturday with De Gea expected to start in goal for Mourinho’s team. But with just two weeks remaining of the window, the prospect of losing De Gea would not please either Mourinho or the Old Trafford faithful.


Through most of the summer transfer window of 2017, Tottenham Hotspur has resisted the urge to spend its share of the Premier League’s vast television contract.
Mauricio Pochettino’s team hasn’t signed a player yet, and even worse—for those who cling to their team’s activity in the transfer market with a fervor bordering on the religious—it lost one in Kyle Walker: The right-back went to Manchester City for £50 million ($64.4 million).
Tottenham, which finished runner-up in the 2016-17 Premier League and has been the league’s most consistent side over the past two seasons, may be more circumspect than its rivals, but it is not a totally different beast and knows it must speculate even to stand still, let alone move forward.
Pochettino waited until two weeks before the summer transfer window closes to move for a player. Davinson Sanchez, the 21-year-old Ajax defender, is set to arrive in a deal that could eventually rise to £42 million, according to The Guardian.
Sanchez caught Tottenham's eye during Ajax’s run to the Europa League final last season as a skilful, muscular presence in central defense. He was one of a select few players to emerge in credit from the chastening Europa League Final defeat to Manchester United in Stockholm in May. That night, José Mourinho brilliantly nullified Ajax’s talented young team, but Sanchez remained defiant. Such qualities, mental as much as physical, do not come cheap.
Despite Sanchez’s undoubted talent and potential, in a way this appears a curious signing. A club-record transfer would expect, normally, to slot straight into the first team, but Spurs already have two of the Premier League’s best center backs, and perhaps its best central defensive partnership, in Jan Vertonghen and Toby Alderweireld.
As it stands, Tottenham has paid £42 million for a backup, but Vertonghen in particular has struggled with injuries, so Sanchez should get his chance soon enough.
There wasn’t much to fix in Tottenham’s team, so Pochettino has instead chosen to patch over future problems before they appear. If Sanchez plays up to and beyond expectations, that could prove a prudent strategy.


Kevin Durant has joined the long list of American athletes protesting against President Donald Trump, with the NBA star insisting he won’t attend the White House if Golden State is invited.
Traditionally, the NBA champions visit the president in Washington at some point during the season after winning the title. In November,  President Obama hosted the 2016 champion Cleveland Cavaliers at the White House.
But ever since  Donald Trump was elected to office, there has been questions about whether the Warriors would meet with him. The answer, for  Durant anyway, is a resounding no.
“Nah, I won’t do that,” Durant told  ESPN. “I don’t respect who’s in office right now.” Durant’s words follow that of fellow  basketball star LeBron James, one of the Cavaliers players to visit Obama last fall. He said Trump had made hate “fashionable again” and described him as the “so-called president.”
Prior to that, NFL’s Michael Bennett had protested against the national anthem by sitting down, and implored white players to join in to have any impact. Last year, Colin Kaepernick set the tone by kneeling during the anthem.

The disdain toward  Trump comes after he was condemned for defending far-right marchers that were involved in violence in Charlottesville, which saw one woman killed when a car was deliberately driven into a crowd. “Not all of those people were neo-Nazis, not all of those people were white supremacists,” Trump said.
Durant believes his teammates will support him in his boycott. “I don’t agree with what [Trump] agrees with, so my voice is going to by heard by not doing that,” he said. “That’s just me personally, but if I know my guys well enough, they’ll all agree with me.”
The 28-year-old insisted that Trump was not only having a negative effect on race relations, but was heavily involved in it. “He’s definitely driving it,” Durant added. “I feel ever since he’s got into office, or since he ran for presidency, our country has been so divided and it’s not a coincidence. When Obama was in office, things were looking up. We had so much hope in our communities where I come from because we had a black president, and that was a first.”


You can almost hear it: that deep, heavy exhale of relief coming out of north London this morning as Tottenham Hotspur finally spends some money in this transfer window.
Mauricio Pochettino’s team has plodded along all summer, retaining its best players and squeezing all the juice out of its sales (Manchester City paid £54 million, or $69 million, for Kyle Walker), while builders put together a shiny, and expensive, new stadium in  Tottenham.
But finally, the team can put an end to jibes from rival fans comparing Spurs to  Arsenal. Tottenham, it seems, has opened its wallet. Elsewhere,  Manchester United is looking to dig even deeper into its purse as it searches for a winger.
Here,  Newsweek  guides you through all you the news and rumors swirling around the Premier League’s transfer window:
Tottenham is on the verge of completing the signing of Ajax center-back  Davinson Sanchez, according to the  Daily Telegraph. And it won’t be cheap. Spurs will pay £28 million for the 21-year-old with a possible add-on fee of £14 million, according to  The Independent.
Manchester United, however, is a club that is used to spending a lot of money, particularly over the past few seasons. This summer, José Mourinho’s team has already spent around £150 million, but the Portuguese wants more and is determined to sign Inter Milan winger  Ivan Perisić. The  Daily Mirror says United has only tabled a bid of £38 million, though.  
The  same newspaper says that Chelsea has seen a £63 million offer for Juventus left-back  Alex Sandro rejected, with Antonio Conte determined to sign the 26-year-old Brazilian.

Barcelona has admitted it will be “difficult” to sign  Philippe Coutinho from Liverpool due to the fact he does not have a buyout clause from Anfield, the  Liverpool Echo says. The La Liga giant has reportedly been willing to pay £120 million for the Brazilian, but the  Daily Telegraph says Barca will continue to fight for the signing until the end of the transfer window.
Chelsea outcast  Diego Costa says he will not return to Stamford Bridge as he wants a move to Atlético Madrid, according to the  Daily Telegraph. But in a surprise move,  The Sun says, big-spending Everton will look to take the Spaniard on loan from Chelsea this season.
Finally, Arsenal is set to lose center-back  Gabriel for £10 million, according to the  London Evening Standard. The 26-year-old Brazilian is set to join Spanish club Valencia.


Marco Asensio’s goal in the second leg of the Spanish Super Cup against Barcelona on Wednesday was wonderful, but it was not a surprise.
Asensio, the 21-year-old winger from Mallorca, picked the ball up around 30 yards from the Barcelona goal. He shifted the ball almost imperceptibly onto his left foot and then, with minimal backlift, he sent a swerving, dipping shot into the top corner. Marc-Andre ter Stegen, the Barcelona goalkeeper, was well-positioned to save the strike and yet he didn’t move, just watched it scorch past him, a firework from a world slightly more fabulous than this one.
If you wear spectacles, sometimes you will search madly for them in drawers and on worktops before finding them on the end of your nose. Signed from Mallorca in 2014, Asensio was always meant to be good but it’s probable Real never expected his progression to be this rapid. He scored in the Champions League final against Juventus in June and he scored in the first leg of the Super Cup last week with a goal almost as ridiculous as his second-leg effort.
It takes a special talent to make Gareth Bale seem like the past. Bale continues to work his way back tentatively from injury; he was left out of the Real team on Tuesday for Asensio and when the youngster was substituted it was for Theo Hernandez, not Bale.
It’s possible to view Bale’s omission from several different perspectives, of course. Isco, too, was left on the bench and he remains a crucial part of Zinedine Zidane’s plans this season. But Isco does not have to compete with the startling Asensio. Right now, it is hard to see how it is possible for Zidane to leave Asensio out of his starting lineup. So either he luxuriates in a 86 million pound substitute or Real signals to Europe’s circling predatory birds that Bale is available for a transfer. It was revealed this week that Jose Mourinho and Manchester United have made one play for Bale this summer already. The rise and rise of Asensio should give them renewed hope for the chase.


Although the game provided drama and entertainment for the neutral, Jurgen Klopp will have been dissatisfied with Liverpool's start to the Premier League season.
Away to Watford, at Vicarage Road on Saturday,  Liverpool saw a lead slip away twice and had to settle for a draw. Free-flowing, creative  Liverpool was at its best going forward but, also, at its typical worst at the back.
Sadio Mane returned to the ranks after injury kept him out of the team at the end of last season, scoring the first goal for  Klopp’s team. Then, new summer signing Mohamed Salah, £34 million (about $44 million) from Roma, looked to have won the game as  Liverpool went 3-2 ahead with half an hour to play, only to see a late equalizer from Miguel Britos.
With Mane and Salah joining the impressive Roberto Firmino up front, Klopp’s attack looked as lethal as ever. But his defense was crying out for organization and more quality.
All three of Watford’s goals game from poor marking by the Merseysiders. The defense, it seemed, was the first area Klopp would strengthen this summer, with Liverpool set to sign Virgil van Dijk from Southampton.

It has turned out not to be, so far, with Liverpool apologizing to the St Mary’s club for its pursuit of the Dutch center back and withdrawing interest. There is, though, still a chance that Van Dijk could begin September playing football at Anfield after he submitted a transfer request.
Although Liverpool possesses one of the league’s strongest forward lines, it is still lacking. Last season, of the six defeats Klopp’s team suffered in the Premier League, only one game against a team that finished in the top half of the table — and that was Eddie Howe’s Bournemouth.
Related:   Liverpool Fends Off Coutinho Bids, Now Faces Offer For Other Star Player
These losses, in most cases, came when Liverpool was up against teams that put out a regimented team, wary of throwing too many men forward. Games like this required a big man up front, a striker who could score from a set piece or bully his way to goal; a player Liverpool doesn’t have.
This is an area Klopp should consider, but the German manager seems satisfied with his squad and determined to play with his philosophy.
But with Liverpool competing in both the Premier League and Champions League this season, will one signing be enough for Klopp to finally deliver some silverware?


Arsene Wenger is willing to take a £200 million (about $258 million) gamble on keeping out-of-contract players, and insists he has the backing of the Arsenal board, according to reports.
The north London club has begun this  Premier League season with some of its best players heading into the final year of their contracts.
Alexis Sanchez, Mesut Ozil and  Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain will all leave for free next summer if new deals are not made, seeing  Arsenal write off at least £200 million worth of business.
Earlier this week,  Wenge r insisted that none of his star players would be sold during this transfer window but also refused to guarantee they would be at the Emirates after the August 31 deadline closes.
“One hundred per cent never exists, because in our job [guarantees] never exist,” said Wenger, as quoted by the  Daily Mail.
“But today, yes. I think all...three will stay. I will fight for them to stay. It’s my decision, but after the board has to, of course, agree with me.
“And if they don’t agree we have to consider it as well, and I will accept it. But the board is behind me on that. [Keeping them] is a financial sacrifice; it is a sacrifice that you have to calculate, how much it costs.”

And it could be a costly error for Arsenal this season. A variety of clubs, including Manchester City, Chelsea and Bayern Munich wanted Sanchez, who looked unsettled at the Emirates last season. Offers of around £80 million are thought to have been made to Arsenal, but Wenger did not want to sell to a direct rival through fear of negatively affecting his team.
Oxlade-Chamberlain is another target for Antonio Conte’s Chelsea, with some reports saying the west London club is confident of landing the 23-year-old midfielder for £35 million.
Chelsea is desperate for signings after losing the opening game of the season 3-2 to Burnley with a slim squad.


Golden State star Kevin Durant insists the Cavaliers shouldn’t trade LeBron James but believes Cleveland could be a force without him.
Durant, who was part of the Warriors team that beat James and the Cavs in the NBA Finals earlier this summer, entered into a debate about his rival on social media.
Responding to rapper Lil Dicky, who once featured  Durant in one of his music videos, the Warriors man claimed Cleveland would be foolish to allow James to leave.
After Lil Dicky said the team should “one thousand percent” trade James, Durant jumped in and said that you “can’t trade a legend. He is Cleveland, he gets to hold the cards."
James is believed to be unsettled, though. After losing the NBA championship and seeing Cavs chairman Dan Gilbert fire General Manager David Griffin, the 32-year-old is reported to be frustrated and can opt out of his contract next summer.       
Because of this, Lil Dicky said that if he were James, he would “despise Gilbert for a variety of reasons.” He also told Durant that he thought Gilbert would want to get “something back this time” after James left Cavs for Miami Heat in 2010. “He’s gone,” Lil Dicky said.
But although Durant said he understood the situation, he added that James, the three-time NBA champion, was not a unique player, suggesting Cavs could not treat him like any other.
He added: “Last time he left they got like 3 number one picks. So either way they are good lol.”
 
u can&#39;t trade a legend. He is Cleveland, he gets to hold the cards
 
 
I feel what you&#39;re saying. Most owners think that way, but then you realize it&#39;s lebron james.
 
 
last time he left they got like 3 number one picks. So either way they are good lol
 
Cleveland, however, will not want to lose both James and Kyrie Irving, who made a trade request earlier this summer; that could be nuclear.


The Oxford English Dictionary defines F.O.M.O., or “Fear Of Missing Out,” as, “Anxiety that an exciting or interesting event may currently be happening elsewhere, often aroused by posts seen on social media.”
But this peculiarly millennial angst can seep into Premier League football clubs too. It is possible to imagine Jose Mourinho sat in darkened room at the weekend, pain in his eyes and unspent banknotes weighing heavily in his pocket, as he watched Neymar's sparkling debut for Paris Saint-Germain—in which he scored once and generally looked like one of the world’s best players, if not one worth €222 million ($261 million), 
Mourinho reportedly tried to sign Neymar this summer from Barcelona, and that is not all: on The Transfer Podcast, journalist Duncan Castles also reveals that United made approaches for Antoine Griezmann and Gareth Bale.
“Antoine Griezmann he [Mourinho] tried to get, Neymar he was involved in trying to persuade to come to Manchester United, he's tried to get Gareth Bale,” Castles said, quoted by the Daily Star.
“He obviously sees that Man Utd need more of that if he's to make them what he's expected to—contenders for the Champions League.”
Griezmann remains an Atletico Madrid player, while Bale is still at Real Madrid. Mourinho beat Chelsea to the signing of Romelu Lukaku to fill his need for a striker, and the Belgian has made a prolific start to his United career.
Still, it’s instructive to learn a little more of Mourinho’s plans this summer. Clearly, he still sees United’s left wing as a problem area. Neymar is clearly now off limits and a Bale transfer is probably unachievable too, at least this summer. But don’t be surprised to see United active in the last two weeks of the transfer window, as Mourinho tries to avoid missing out on any more invitations to parties.


The last two weeks of the summer transfer window will be frantic for Antonio Conte more than any other manager as he looks for new signings to galvanize the underperforming Premier League champion.
Despite  Chelsea spending £150 million (about $193 million) this summer, the Italian coach is desperately in search of new additions to his squad. While Tottenham hasn’t made a signing this window, it has also retained its players, something Chelsea hasn't managed—Conte lost Nemanja Matic and  Diego Costa is believed to be leaving.
But  Conte is not the only manager on the lookout for new signings. Manchester City’s £250 million spending spree doesn’t look over, while  Manchester United is planning on bringing back a fan favorite to Old Trafford.
Here,  Newsweek  guides you through all the news and rumors swirling around the Premier League as the transfer window gradually begins to shut:
Chelsea looks set to miss out on Tottenham left-back  Danny Rose as Spurs is not willing to entertain any offers for the 27-year-old, according to the  London Evening Standard. Chelsea was willing to pay £50 million for Rose and would have doubled his salary, following the defender’s comments last week that he wasn’t paid what he was worth.
But Chelsea has not given up on its other target at left-back. Conte is relying on Juventus’  Alex Sandro to hand in a transfer request after it had two bids rejected by the Italian giant, the  London Evening Standard also reported. But the fee is likely to be at least £60 million.
Related:   Manchester United’s summer spending spree is over, but Jose Mourinho already has plans for January
Manchester United might have found a way to bring  Zlatan Ibrahimovic back to Old Trafford this summer, according to  The Independent. The 35-year-old Swedish striker was released by United after getting injured at the end of last season, and is still unlikely to play until the new year. But Jose Mourinho wants Ibrahimovic to return with a part-time coaching role.
Across town, Pep Guardiola’s Manchester City has had an £18 million bid for West Brom defender  Jonny Evans rejected, according to  the BBC. The move would be controversial after Evans played for Manchester United for so many years, but it has been done before. Argentinian striker Carlos Tevez played in both red and sky blue.

Tottenham continues to search for its first signing of the season, but it doesn’t look likely to be Celta Vigo midfielder  Pape Cheikh Diop, according to the  Daily Mail, after Lyon outbid the north London club’s £9 million offer.
Leicester City wants £40 million from Chelsea for midfielder  Danny Drinkwater but Conte’s club has offered £25 million plus add-ons, also according to the  Daily Mail. Should Chelsea meet Leicester’s demands it would see all the cash received for Matic spent on Drinkwater.


The chorus rebuking President Donald Trump grows louder by the day, and it isn’t exactly novel for just about anyone—outside of Republicans in Congress, that is—to admonish the president. But when LeBron James does something—anything, really—it stands out.
There is no current American athlete more important, famous or relevant. For the better part of a decade he’s been the best player in a sport that’s increasingly popular with young Americans. And his entire career he’s avoided the sorts of scandals that have plagued countless other top athletes. So it matters when James criticizes the president of the United States.
He did so repeatedly and forcefully this week after Trump opted to half-heartedly condemn neo-Nazis—claiming counterprotesters were also bad—even after a white supremacist drove a car into a group of anti-Nazi marchers in Charlottesville, Virginia, killing a woman and injuring more than a dozen. Said James in front of thousands of kids at an event for his charity:
“I know there’s a lot of tragic things happening in Charlottesville. I just want to speak on it right now. I have this platform and I'm somebody that has a voice of command, and the only way for us to be able to get better as a society and us to get better as people is love. And that’s the only way we’re going to be able to conquer something at the end of the day. It’s not about the guy that’s the so-called president of the United States, or whatever the case. It’s not about a teacher that you don’t feel like cares about whatˆ’s going on with you every day. It’s not about people that you just don’t feel like want to give the best energy and effort to you. It’s about us. It’s about us looking in the mirror. Kids all the way up to the adults. It’s about all of us looking in the mirror and saying, ‘What can we do better to help change?’ And if we can all do that and give 110 percent...then that’s all you can ask for. So, shoutout to the innocent people in Charlottesville and shoutout to everybody across the world that just want to be great and just want to love. Thank you, and I love you all.”
He would later follow up with a tweet that was also critical of Trump. James wrote, “Hate has always existed in America. Yes, we know that but Donald Trump just made it fashionable again! Statues has nothing to do with us now!”
James had no obligation to speak his mind. And his decision to do so—even if to say something as ostensibly obvious as Nazis are bad, racism is wrong, and love is good—comes with potential negative ramifications. When it comes down to it, athletes are effectively in sales—they’re convincing you their thing (a ticket to a game, a sneaker, a television package) provides more value than literally anything else you could spend that money on. A lot of people voted for Trump, which means a lot of people might disagree with James. But his generation, perhaps with the Cleveland star at the helm, has done well to ignore the “Stick to sports” folks who seem to plague every message board online.

That hasn’t always been the case. Michael Jordan—James’ historical counterpart and the barometer by which the Cleveland Cavalier has always been measured—famously avoided anything that might put a crack in his sterling image. It’s lore that Jordan once avoided giving an endorsement on a political race in his home state of North Carolina, even though one candidate was widely considered a racist, because, “Republicans buy shoes, too.” And while that quote was secondhand and has since been called into question, it does do a nice job of summarizing the way Jordan operated.
But more and more athletes—African-American athletes, especially—have begun taking stances against things they feel are unjust, in the model of predecessors like Kareem Abdul Jabbar, Jackie Robinson and Muhammad Ali. In 2016, for instance, James and fellow NBA superstars Carmelo Anthony, Chris Paul and Dwayne Wade cited these former athletes when they opened ESPN’s ESPY Awards with a call for social change after a week defined by police-involved shootings. 
“The system is broken, the problems are not new, the violence is not new, and the racial divide definitely is not new, but the urgency for change is definitely at an all-time high,” Anthony said.
Since then, NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick began taking a knee during the national anthem to protest the oppression of people of color in the United States, inspiring others to follow suit, and has since effectively been blackballed from the league. But athletes aren’t relenting. Recently unretired Oakland Raider Marshawn Lynch sat during the anthem this week, as did Seattle Seahawk Michael Bennet. 
“The last week, with everything that’s been going on in the last couple months—especially after the last couple days seeing everything in [Charlottesville] Virginia...I just wanted to be able to continue to use my platform to be able to speak on injustice,” Bennett said.

It all points to a simple fact: Sports are not a haven from politics or real-world issues anymore. That’s important. The country is divided at the moment, and we largely only ingest the news and entertainment we want to ingest. Consider that the most popular TV show these days, Game of Thrones, is watched by about 16 million people while more than 105 million people watched the finale of M*A*S*H in 1983.
Live sports are one of the few things we really pay attention to en masse. About 111 million people watched the latest Super Bowl, while nearly 25 million watched Game 5 of the latest NBA Finals. LeBron James could live a sterilized public life. It’d likely be easier. But he has millions of people at his beck and call, and in a 24-hour news cycle, literally everything he does is news. (Similar to the aforementioned “so-called president.”)
It might seem a benign observation on James’ part to condemn white supremacists and to tell the world he felt heartbreak over senseless death. But the year is 2017, and amid the constant tumult and shouting, it’s helpful to have a voice—especially one massively amplified by celebrity—advocate for love.


Is the second goodbye harder or easier than the first, or does a repeated parting further numb the lover already desensitized to grief?
The Cleveland Cavaliers may be about to find out.
For most of high summer it has seemed the Cavaliers’ biggest headache is finding a suitable trade partner for Kyrie Irving, to surround James with the experience he needs to win a second title in Cleveland.
In other words, the plan appeared to be to placate James, who is likely to lose the man he has called his “little brother,” one of the NBA’s elite offensive players and a prized asset despite his suspect defense.

Not so, according to ESPN. Adrian Wojnarowski reported on Tuesday that the Cavaliers have been stung into action by Irving’s trade request and want to accelerate the process of making their roster younger. That’s at odds with James’s wishes but the Cavaliers have decided they cannot be “reactive” to James, according to Wojnarowski. Cleveland is looking at the Knicks’ Kristaps Porzingis and two of the top draft picks from 2017, the Celtics’ Jayson Tatum and the Phoenix Suns’ Josh Jackson.
What does this mean? The Cavaliers are going to rebuild with or without James, who can opt out of the final year of his contract next summer. Wojnarowski says the Cavaliers haven’t “given up” on re-signing James but they want him to commit to a long-term deal. That seems fair enough on both sides, as a proper rebuild is going to be pretty difficult while there is still uncertainty over your two marquee players in James and Irving. From James’s point of view, this will almost certainly be the last time in his career he can test free agency.
What will the mood be like in northeast Ohio should James leave for a second time? Now James has led the Cavaliers to a championship, the lover’s bile should be less poisonous but then you can never predict the strength of a sports fan’s scorn. Regardless, James has to do what’s right for James, and the Cavaliers have to consider the best option to allow them to re-tool. A parting of the ways, bitter as it may sound, may be the most logical option.


Last year, Usain Bolt had the opportunity to train with German Bundesliga club Borussia Dortmund, but it wasn’t where he wanted to be.
Bolt, the  eight-time Olympic gold medalist, would have rather been in the northwest of England, wearing the red jersey of the Red Devils. “For me,”  he said in November, “if I could get to play for  Manchester United, that would be like a dream come true. That would be epic.”
And now, having retired from athletics Saturday at the World Championships in London, he will have his chance.  Bolt is due to feature for  Manchester United in a “Legends” game against Barcelona on September 2, according to Spanish newspaper  AS.
Bolt, who says he is a fan of Jose Mourinho’s team, will be joined in the lineup by former United stars including Edwin van der Sar, Paul Scholes, Dwight Yorke and Phil Neville.
In the blue and garnet of Barcelona will be Gaizka Mendieta, Eric Abidal, Miguel Ángel Nadal, Gheorghe Popescu, Ion Andoni Goikoetxea and Julio Salinas.

Bolt hung up his running spikes Saturday after competing in his last race, the 4x100 meter relay for Jamaica, having run the 100 meter final on August 5. The 30-year-old came third in the very last weekend, behind Americans  Justin Gatlin, who was first, and Christian Coleman.
Bolt then raced on Saturday in what would be his final competition, in the Jamaican relay team, but it ended in disaster. Running the last leg of the 4x100 meters, he pulled his hamstring and was unable to finish.
He will hope the injury recovers enough to allow him to appear in the red of Manchester United in a fortnight. Dortmund just won’t do.


In his second season as Manchester United manager, Jose Mourinho appears close to building a team capable of challenging for the Premier League.
His United team was one of the most impressive performers on the opening weekend of the 2017-18 season, bolting out of the starting gate in a 4-0 victory against a poor West Ham United team at Old Trafford on Sunday.
Two of United’s new signings, Nemanja Matic and Romelu Lukaku, played key roles in the victory and look as if they will be vital in helping United improve upon its sixth-place finish from last season.
Even Mourinho’s detractors would struggle to deny that United is close to title contention, with another new signing, Victor Lindelof, yet to be integrated into the starting lineup.
There is, though, an area of United’s team Mourinho is yet to fix completely, and he manages it then it could put the club over the top as title favorite alongside Manchester City.
Though Marcus Rashford performed strongly against West Ham, providing the assist for Lukaku’s first goal and almost scoring himself with a curling shot off the post in the second half, Mourinho cannot rely on a teenager to fill that crucial space on the left wing all season long. Nor can he totally trust Anthony Martial to track back and defend. In any case, Martial is more of an inside-forward, as he showed with his fine late goal in the West Ham victory.
Mourinho has been chasing a left winger all summer, with Ivan Perisic and Real Madrid’s Gareth Bale both linked with moves to Old Trafford. Neither of those transfers look likely to come off and if they don’t, it will not be a disaster for the Portuguese. United has enough of a threat from the right, with Henrikh Mkhitaryan, to make up for the inconsistency of youth on its left-hand side.
A left winger does look like the final piece, though, in a potential title-winning side. Expect Mourinho to go all in for one in the final two weeks of this transfer window.


Liverpool returns to Champions League action Tuesday night, but faces tough competition in the qualifying stage.
Julien Nagelsmann, the 30-year-old German manager, welcomes  Jurgen Klopp and his  Liverpool team to the Rhein-Neckar-Arena for the first leg against Hoffenheim.
Liverpool has not appeared in the group stage of the Champions League since 2014, but will end that run by beating Bundesliga club  Hoffenheim over two legs.
The game will be aired live on Fox Sports 1 and Fox Deportes, while you can also stream it at  fuboTV and  Fox Sports Go. Kick-off is at 2.45 p.m. (ET). 
Liverpool is without its star player  Philippe Coutinho, who is still linked with a move to Barcelona after submitting a transfer request, but that is not concerning Klopp.

“For three months we have been looking forward to this game,” he said, as quoted by the  BBC.
“We are here, in a good mood, looking forward to the game but aware of the qualities of the opposition and the difficulty of the game.
“But it is just good to be here and to have the chance even though we know it is really hard.”
Liverpool’s start to the season didn’t go quite as planned as Klopp’s team was held to a 3-3 draw with Watford at Vicarage Road.

The positive for the Merseysiders was that new signing Mohamed Salah scored on his debut for the team, while Sadio Mane was also on target after returning from injury.
Liverpool will host Crystal Palace at Anfield on Saturday before Hoffenheim travels to the north-west of England on Wednesday, August 23 for the second leg.


Since the Major League Baseball All-Star break, Aaron Judge had been slumping, missing pitches he was crushing in the first half of the season.
On Monday night Judge broke out at one of the Yankees’ more crucial moments of the season. With Joe Girardi’s team trailing the Mets 2-1 in the sixth inning, Judge took a pitch from Rafael Montero and hammered it to right-center field.
Aaron Hicks put the Yankees ahead in the eighth inning with his own home run, before catcher Gary Sanchez added another homer for a 4-2 Yankees victory.
Judge and Sanchez both reached 40 career home runs with the hits, while the Yankees gained a game on the Boston Red Sox in the race for the American League East title. The Red Sox lost 7-3 to the Cleveland Indians at Fenway Park on Monday night.
You can watch Judge’s blast, his first home run in 11 games, here.



Arsenal has put up a fierce stance over the future of Alexis Sanchez. “He is not for sale,” is the constant message from Arsene Wenger’s mouth, but it doesn’t seem to be getting through to Manchester City.
Despite spending about £250 million this summer (around $324 million) on new recruits,  Pep Guardiola is not finished. According to the  Daily Telegraph, City will test the resolve of  Arsenal once more before the transfer window closes by making an £60 million ($78m) offer.
The report says that City is willing to make  Sanchez the highest paid player in the Premier League by offering him £400,000 a week, including bonuses and image rights, to lure him from the  Emirates Stadium.
Despite Wenger’s adamant approach to Sanchez, uncertainty still surrounds the Chilean forward due to his absence. Although he was sat in the stands at the Emirates Stadium on Friday for Arsenal’s dramatic 4-3 win over Leicester City, he is said to be unavailable due to abdominal pains. He may even miss this coming weekend’s match with Stoke City, too.
Sanchez has already worked with Guardiola, signed by the Spaniard during his time at Barcelona. Together, they won four trophies in two seasons, before Guardiola left for a sabbatical.

Chelsea has also been linked with a move for Sanchez but, like City, Arsenal does not want to sell to a direct rival, fearing the harm he could do. The more likely destination has been Bayern Munich, capable of paying Sanchez’s high wages and not a direct rival of Arsenal.
If the saga rumbles on into January unresolved, the north London club will not have a say over the type of jersey Sanchez next wears, for he will be free to speak to any club he likes and come to a pre-contract agreement.
Arsenal already has reinforcements at the Emirates Stadium this summer. The Gunners signed Alexandre Lacazette for a club record £46.5 million ($60m), with the Frenchman scoring on his debut while Olivier Giroud came off the bench to head in a dramatic winner.
After such a positive result, Arsenal may be willing to consider a high offer for Sanchez instead of letting him go for free next summer.


It is only mid-August, but already Liverpool faces two defining fixtures in itsseason.
Jurgen Klopp’s team travels to Rhein-Neckar-Arena in southwestern Germany on Tuesday evening to face Hoffenheim in the Champions League playoffs. The prize: lucrative qualification for Europe’s premier club competition.
Failure will mean more soul-searching for Klopp and Liverpool, and the unravelling of last season’s progress in the Premier League. Here’s how defeat by the Bundesliga team could hurt Liverpool.
While the Premier League television contract still dwarfs money earned from the Champions League, that doesn’t make the prize money irrelevant. In reaching the semifinals in 2015-16, Manchester City took in €83.8 million ($98.5 million) according to The Guardian - enough to afford one more elite player, if not his wages too.
Beating Hoffenheim to reach the group stage of the Champions League would earn Liverpool €12.7 million ($14.9 million) plus its share of the market pool - the money UEFA allocates to Champions League participants according to the size of the television markets in each club’s country. Qualification from the group stage becomes progressively more lucrative thanks to UEFA’s prize money system.
Yes, footballers want to play for money. That’s not going to change, ever. But it often seems a little insulting to suggest that is their only motivation. The best players want to play in the best club competition, which remains the Champions League.
Liverpool has endured a difficult summer attempting to recruit players, with several huge, failed bids for RB Leipzig’s Naby Keita. Leipzig can hold onto Keita because they are in the Champions League; qualification could allow Liverpool to attract the players Jurgen Klopp wants and needs to improve his squad. Fail against Hoffenheim over the two legs, and Klopp will have to market the Europa League as an attractive destination.
Coutinho won’t play in the first leg against Hoffenheim as reports and rumors swirl around a transfer to Barcelona. Liverpool seems determined to keep hold of its best and most crucial player but missing out on playing in the Champions League would give Coutinho leverage to put even more pressure on Liverpool to let him leave.
It’s too early in the season to say that Klopp is a man under pressure but Liverpool showed some familiar mistakes in its first Premier League fixture of the season against Watford on Saturday, including defensive weaknesses from set pieces. Smooth progress to the group stages would relieve much of the early-season tension around Anfield.
Liverpool held its nerve at the end of last season to qualify for this stage of the Champions League but it lost two major finals in its first season under Klopp and there may remain a perception that it chokes at crucial moments. Failure against Hoffenheim would add weight to that view.
Not directly Liverpool's problem, of course. But for a league regularly marketed as the “best in the world,” the Premier League has a poor recent record of sending teams to the later stages of the Champions League. Only Leicester made it last season, harming the Premier League’s reputation compared to Serie A, the Bundesliga and La Liga.
Hoffenheim, the fourth-best team last season, against England’s fourth-best team in Liverpool is a fascinating test of how strong the Premier League really is, versus its self-regard.


The Lakers fans adored Magic Johnson on the court, but they’ll love him even more in the boardroom if he completes the move of the decade.
Johnson played a pivotal part in bringing  Lonzo Ball to Staples Center earlier this summer in the NBA trade, but he could complete the ultimate scoop next summer.
LeBron James's future in Cleveland in far from certain. The 32-year-old was left frustrated by losing the NBA Finals to Golden State, irritated by the firing of General Manager David Griffin and then seeing Kyrie Irving make a trade request.
James has a get-out clause, though. Next summer, he is able to exercise the right to opt out of his contract with the Cavs, to move away once again. Miami Heat has been mentioned as a  possible destination; Houston Rockets, too. But the potential of a move to  the Lakers grows ever more plausible.
James has a home in Los Angeles, he is wanted there by its newest asset and future star Ball—in an interview with ESPN earlier this summer, Ball said to James, “I think our games could help each other out a lot. Anytime you want the ball, just let me know, and it’s going to be there”—and he is close with Magic Johnson. On Monday, he wished the Lakers president a happy birthday and praised him for always being there for him throughout his career.
Related:   LeBron James Agent to The Lakers: ‘Let’s Talk’
"Happy birthday @MagicJohnson!! One of the few that's always showed love from day 1 to me! Thank you. Enjoy your day!!"  James tweeted.
Happy birthday @MagicJohnson!! One of the few that&#39;s always showed love from day 1 to me! Thank you. Enjoy your day!!

In July, reports suggested  James’s agent Rich Paul has been in talks with the Lakers, which sparked speculation over whether an agreement was already being put in place.
Whether James does decide to leave home for a second time next summer remains to be seen. What we do know is that he'll have plenty of offers, but the Lakers is increasingly making more sense.


The NBA released its schedule for 2017-18 on Monday night, and immediately threw up a whole clutch of intriguing story lines.
Chief among those is the unresolved question of where Kyrie Irving, the Cleveland Cavaliers’ star point guard, will be playing. Irving, linked with the Phoenix Suns this month, wants a trade away from the Cavaliers, who entertain the Boston Celtics on opening night.
Here are the games you should look out for in the first week of the new season.
A doozy from Oracle Arena on the first day of the season. Can Chris Paul and James Harden’s two-headed ballhandling monster provide a real rival for the Warriors? We will get a first hint here.
Can the Celtics repeat as Eastern Conference champions? Much will depend on how Gordon Hayward, one of the marquee free-agent signings of summer 2017, can help Isaiah Thomas.
Jimmy Butler, Karl-Anthony Towns and Andrew Wiggins could be one of the most dynamic front courts in the league. They run into Kawhi Leonard and the ever-excellent Spurs first up.
Will Kyrie Irving be playing in the Nevada desert by the middle of October? Even if he isn’t, the Suns should improve on last season with the startling talent of shooting guard Devin Booker.
Unmissable for a variety of reasons. Are the Knicks going to be dysfunctional again? Will Carmelo Anthony still be there? And how good are Russell Westbrook and Paul George going to be together?
The Chris Paul-less Clippers visit the Lakers for a first sighting on national television in the new season of Lonzo Ball and Magic Johnson’s young, exciting team.
LeBron James and friends head out on the road to Wisconsin, but will it be James and Irving in the back court or James and Derrick Rose?
The Warriors are certain to be one of the top two seeds in the Western Conference but some mystery still surrounds the Pelicans. Anthony Davis and DeMarcus Cousins is the scariest front-court combination in the league but only if they can work together effectively.
The Markelle Fultz-led 76ers should be energetic and exciting at the very least. One of the league’s elite point guards, DeMar DeRozan, needs to take the Raptors to the next level.
How far can an ageing Dwyane Wade take the Bulls now that Butler has departed? What Wade would give for a player of Leonard’s ability to pay alongside him…


The start of the Premier League season may be a whole new relaxing experience for managers next season.
By next summer, a rule could be in place that will see the transfer window close before the Premier League season begins, according to the  Daily Telegraph.
The news will please Jurgen Klopp who is trying to hold onto  Philippe Coutinho at Liverpool and Paul Clement who is desperate to have Gylfi Sigurdsson beyond August 31.
But, for now, the rules are yet to change, and  Premier League clubs are still looking to poach from rivals in the final few weeks of the window.
Here,  Newsweek  guides you through all the news and rumors swirling around the Premier League:
We begin with a club trying to land one of its rival’s star players. Chelsea is growing increasingly confident that it will sign English midfielder  Alex Oxlade Chamberlain from Arsenal for £35 million (about $45 million), according to the  London Evening Standard . Antonio Conte is desperate to add to his depleted squad.
But one Chelsea player has been ordered to return. After  Diego Costa claimed in an interview with the  Daily Mail on Monday that the west London club had treated him like a “criminal,” Chelsea has now ordered the Spanish striker back to Stamford Bridge, the  Guardian says, and that he must meet demands before being sold. Costa says he wants to return to Atletico Madrid.

Another player who could be on the move to Spain is  Philippe Coutinho, as Barcelona wants the Brazilian to replace Neymar at the Camp Nou. But Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp insists he will not be sold, and the  Mirror reports that midfielder and captain Jordan Henderson will look to convince Coutinho to remain at Anfield this season.
Liverpool is likely, however, to miss out on long-term target  Virgil van Dijk , according to  Yahoo. The Southampton defender wants a move away from St. Mary’s but is reportedly more likely to end up at Chelsea or Manchester City, although the club has slapped a £70 million price tag on the Dutch center back.
Tottenham has made little headlines in the transfer market this summer, bar for its notable inactivity; Spurs is yet to spend a penny while others reach up to £250 million. But that could be about to change as  The Independent says  Davinson Sanchez, the 21-year-old Colombian defender, has told Ajax he wants to leave for Mauricio Pochettino’s team.


Almost a month after he demanded a trade, Kyrie Irving remains a member of the Cleveland Cavaliers.
Moving Irving, the all-star point guard, was always likely to be a delicate process for the Cavaliers. The 25-year-old should command a huge return, likely a combination of draft picks and a star forward to help out LeBron James and Kevin Love right now. Anything less than a king’s ransom could be seen as a failure for the Cavaliers—and worse, it could upset James.
But finding a team willing to give up the combination of assets that will satisfy the Cavaliers is apparently proving tricky.
The latest report comes from Darren Wolfson of 1500ESPN.com. Wolfson claims the Phoenix Suns want Irving and would be prepared to give up Eric Bledsoe, a first-round draft pick in 2018 or 2019, and the number four overall pick from 2016, Dragan Bender.
The Cavaliers would ideally like the Suns’ rookie Josh Jackson in any deal, but Jackson, the fourth overall pick from the 2017 NBA Draft, doesn’t sound too positive about the likelihood of moving to northeast Ohio. "I think if that [a trade to the Cavaliers] was going to happen, it would have happened by now," Jackson said on Sunday in quotes reported by CBS.
Giving up Jackson for Irving would be a major risk for the Suns if Irving doesn’t resign with the franchise in 2018 and walks away after a year.
Another option for Irving, reported at the start of August, is a trade to the Detroit Pistons. The Detroit Free Press reported “conversations” between the Pistons’ front office and the Cavaliers. Neither the Suns nor the Pistons were on Irving’s reported list of preferred trade options.
The interest in Irving is not the problem. ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski reported at the end of July that “approximately 20 teams” had registered interest in Irving. The issue for those teams is in deciding how much they can risk giving up for Irving, and for the Cavaliers, on the other side of the trade, in being adequately compensated for a perennial all-star and elite scorer.
If no one makes the Cavaliers a satisfactory offer, then the only realistic option is to head into training camp with Irving still a key member of the team, although Cleveland.com reports that Irving will be moved before the season starts. Irving does, however, have two years remaining on his contract. It isn’t completely inconceivable that Irving and James will end up playing together this season, though it would be strange. The process of moving Irving is certainly taking up time that the Cavaliers could use on getting better.  


Dennis Rodman has claimed San Antonio Spurs coach Gregg Popovich “hated” him and looked at him like he was “the devil,” according to reports.
Popovich joined the Spurs in what became  Rodman’s second and final year at San Antonio, before he left for the Chicago Bulls in 1995.
Rodman, now 56, finished his career with five NBA titles, the same number Popovich has won in his time with the Spurs.  Rodman averaged 5.9 points and 16.8 rebounds for the Spurs, but he looks back on his time with mixed emotions.
“The city kind of embraced me, but what’s his name, Popovich, he hated me,” Rodman told Joe Buck on Undeniable. “He hated my guts because I wasn’t a Bible guy. They looked at me like I was the devil.
“I said, my God, am I the same guy that helped get David Robinson a scoring title and MVP? Am I the same guy that averaged 19.3 rebounds per game for you? Am I the same guy who won 68 damn games? Am I that same guy, but you guys don’t like me? So I said, ‘OK, trade me.’ They traded me to the damn Bulls.”

Despite his feelings, Rodman performed just as well in Chicago. Under coach Phil Jackson, he managed an average of 5.3 points and 15.3 rebounds per game over three seasons. He was also part of the 1995–1996 Bulls team that set an NBA record of 72 wins out of 82 games in the regular season.
Rodman is known as one of the most outspoken players to have ever played basketball and continues to be well into retirement, taking on one of the sport’s most well-respected figures in Popovich.
In June, Rodman made headlines after traveling to North Korea, where he had befriended the country’s leader, Kim Jong-un.
He  said: “My purpose is to actually see if I can keep bringing sports to North Korea, that’s the main thing.”



Seahawks defensive end Michael Bennett believes his new book, Things That Make White People Uncomfortable, will help “start a conversation,” according to reports.
The 31-year-old followed his fellow NFL stars this weekend in protesting during the national anthem. Like Oakland Raiders running back  Marshawn Lynch on Saturday, Bennett sat down during the anthem on Sunday ahead of the Seahawks game against the Los Angeles Chargers.
Both Lynch and Bennett were moved to react after the violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, involving far-right groups and white nationalists. “The last week, with everything that’s been going on in the last couple months—especially after the last couple days seeing everything in Virginia... [I] just wanted to be able to continue to use my platform to be able to speak on injustice,” Bennett said, as quoted by The Guardian.
“First of all, I want to make sure that people understand I love the military. My father was in the military. I love hot dogs like any other American. I love football like any other American. But I don’t love segregation. I don’t love riots. I don’t love oppression. I don’t love gender slander. And I just want to see people have equality that they deserve.”

NFL quarterback  Colin Kaepernick was the first to protest against the national anthem by taking a knee. But Kaepernick, who is now without a team ahead of the new season, was criticized and accused of disrespecting the American armed forces.
After the game, Bennett spoke about his upcoming book that he hopes will spark a new conversation in the United States. The title, Things That Make White People Uncomfortable, is considered controversial, but Bennett insists it is meant to catch people's attention.
“I think the title is just a title to start a conversation so people want to read it,” he said. “The book I’m focusing on is issues that I see that are important in America, and they are my views and opinion.”


The first weekend of the new Premier League season threw up surprises and predictability in almost equal measure.
Routine victories for Manchester United and Manchester City were counterbalanced by an opening-day implosion from defending champion Chelsea and a star turn from Huddersfield Town, which blitzed Crystal Palace in South London.
Here’s how the form guide looks after the first set of fixtures.
Further games will shed more light on whether Huddersfield is getting that strange phenomenon of the newly promoted team, the “bounce” before the bigger clubs work out David Wagner’s tactics.
For the moment, though, the club from West Yorkshire can bask in the mid-August sun. Huddersfield’s quick, clever attackers buzzed around a Crystal Palace side that must improve quickly under new coach Ronald de Boer. Huddersfield’s biggest problem was always likely to be scoring enough goals, but if new striker Steve Mounie can keep up the form he showed against Palace, Wagner may yet pull off the unlikely and keep his team away from relegation.
Presented with the best opportunity it will ever have to knock off the defending Premier League champion on its home ground, Burnley grasped the initiative and did not let go. Three first-half goals, two from Sam Vokes and one from defender Stephen Ward, stunned Chelsea, who also lost Cesc Fàbregas to a red card in the second period. Chelsea pulled two goals back, including one via Álvaro Morata on his Premier League debut. But Antonio Conte’s team could not spoil a terrific display from a Burnley side that was woeful away from home last season.
José Mourinho’s first season at Manchester United was defined by a fragility at Old Trafford that contributed to a disappointing finish of sixth in the league.
That doesn’t seem likely to be a problem this time around. United exploded out of the starting blocks against a sleepy West Ham United, with new signings Romelu Lukaku and Nemanja Matić particularly impressive. Lukaku scored twice. Mourinho would have been pleased with a sharp cameo from Anthony Martial and a fine strike to round the victory off from Paul Pogba, who showed sublime touches throughout. Mourinho finally has a team built in his image.
Sometimes you don’t have to make expensive signings to move forward as a team. In a summer when Paris Saint-Germain and Neymar redrew the boundaries of believability, Tottenham’s approach to the transfer market harkens back to a calmer, bygone era. Mauricio Pochettino sold Kyle Walker to Manchester City for 50 million pounds, safe in the knowledge he had a replacement already at the club in Kieran Tripper.
Tottenham also possesses talent coveted by Europe’s biggest clubs, and Christian Eriksen, Dele Alli and Harry Kane eventually proved too much for Newcastle, which lost captain Jonjo Shelvey to a senseless red card. The margin of victory could have been more than the two goals Tottenham ended with. Next week’s game against Chelsea at Wembley looms large.
Job done for Pep Guardiola, who had to wait until the 70th minute for Sergio Aguero to fire Manchester City in front against a durable Brighton team that had 22 percent of possession. City faces a tricky second game at home against Everton on August 21.
Everton’s heavy summer spending must be matched by results, and it got a win on the first day of the season from a returning favorite. Wayne Rooney’s header in first-half stoppage time was the highlight of a scrappy game against Stoke City.
Is Olivier Giroud ever going to get the love he deserves from pundits and supporters? The Frenchman came off the substitutes’ bench to complete a thrilling Arsenal comeback against Leicester City Friday night. It’s not the first time he has rescued Arsenal, and given the team’s defensive frailties, it almost certainly won’t be the last.
If Marco Silva can continue to coax dominant performances from Stefano Okaka like the one the Italian produced against Liverpool on Saturday, Watford will be well clear of relegation this season.
Tony Pulis will never play with the style to please everyone, but the West Brom manager is superb at what he does: keeping a team in the Premier League. West Brom ceded possession to Bournemouth and scored with a trademark Pulis goal, a set-piece header from defender Ahmed Hegazi.
Southampton remain in a hinterland while the future of Virgil van Dijk is resolved, but they had the better chances in a draw with Swansea City.
Swansea’s situation is strangely similar to Southampton’s, with their best player, Gylfi Sigurðsson, possibly on his way to Everton. In the circumstances, manager Paul Clement will have been pleased with a point.
As thrilling and heroic a defeat as you could imagine, although Leicester would have found a way to win this two seasons ago. Jamie Vardy scoring prolifically again will be a very good thing for Craig Shakespeare, who has Kelechi Iheanacho still to integrate.
Eddie Howe’s team should have made more of its possession against West Brom. Two frightening fixtures against Manchester City and Arsenal loom after it hosts Watford.
After almost a decade in the Premier League, Stoke could finally be at serious risk of dropping into the second tier again. This was a limp start, and they face Arsenal at home on Saturday evening.
Jürgen Klopp’s team is still vibrant in attack, still vulnerable from set pieces and still unable to hold onto a lead against one of the league’s perceived weaker teams. Until two of those three things are solved, a first Premier League title will remain a distant dream.
Chris Hughton’s team will have to be better on the ball if they want to stay up, though fixtures against the likes of City will not define their season.
Does Newcastle have the firepower in attack to avoid relegation? Not on this evidence. Manager Rafael Benítez must be backed in the transfer market before the window closes.
West Ham’s new signings looked good in theory, but only Javier Hernández emerged in credit from a horrible afternoon at Old Trafford. Slaven Bilić’s side was brittle in defense and insipid in attack.
Frank de Boer could hardly have had a more nightmarish start to life as a Premier League manager.
Is it too early to talk of a crisis? Antonio Conte’s team must find a response against Tottenham on Sunday or risk the recurrence of painful memories from its last failed title defense under Mourinho two years ago.


You see it in playgrounds across the world. One child picks another as her target and chases him. She pursues him, getting closer and closer, until he is near enough to reach out and touch. “TAG,” she shouts at the point of contact, and then it’s his turn.
Tag is a game without language, without cost; one that can be played from the moment a child begins to run. It is synonymous with youth, the happy memories of an adult’s childhood. But now, a father and son have relaunched the sport to a new competitive level, one that combines the pace and rules of tag with the agility and skills of parkour.
Christian and Damien Devaux, who live half an hour west of London, are the founders of World Chase Tag. Here,  Newsweek  guides you through everything you need to know about the sport.
“Chase Tag,” Christian says, “is basically the game of tag done with obstacles.” The game can be played as individuals or multiplayer, and there can be up to four athletes on the course, with only one chaser.
In 2009, the Devaux family was doing a little gardening in their family home just outside Windsor, England. They came up with the idea to play tag, using garden rubbish, benches and bins as obstacles to run around. “And then it just grew from there,” Christian says. In 2014, they submitted a patent for the sport, then arranged its first event that summer. “We had meet-up sessions in Hyde Park with a bit of barrier tape and then into parkour gyms, and then we built our first course.” The following year, they named it Chase Tag. 
There are four different formats of games: team chase off, multiplayer, singles chase off and winner stays on.
In team chase off, there are two teams with up to six competitors. The match is divided into an agreed number of sets which consist of around 10 to 16 chases. During each chase, the chaser has 20 seconds to catch and tag his opponent, with the winner staying on to face the next opponent from the loser’s team. A point is awarded to the team that wins each chase.
Similarly, in the singles chase off, there are only two competitors in the match, but the winner is the first to get 10 points, and he or she must win by two clear points. In this game, the match is played in rounds, with competitors taking it in turns to be evader and chaser. Again, there are only 20 seconds to catch your opponent.
In multiplayer, four competitors are involved in each match, which consists of four 40-second rounds. But in this format, each round starts with a different athlete on tag, and it is the competitor with the lowest accumulated tag-time who wins.
The main rules for Chase Tag are that tags can only be made with a hand, and dangerous play is prohibited. Should a competitor step outside the arena, they are considered "tagged," while tag-backs are not allowed in any of the formats other than team chase off. In the winner stays on format, no points are awarded for a tag, but competitors who evade being tagged are awarded one point. Inevitably, the last remaining athlete has the most points and wins.
Who better to ask than the two-time WCT champion Marrero Gang, made up of Jamie De Smet, Greg Ball, James Kirsop Maine, Connor O'Carroll and Kieren Owen?
Ball: “You’ve got to be versatile. The main thing is training yourself not to react how you would react normally, because that’s just fight or flight. You’ve got to take a step back and relax and think, 'What do I need to do to get myself out of this situation,' not just run. I’d say it’s more a mental game than physical.”
Maine: “You can’t just do chasing or evading, you’ve got to be good at both.”
Owen: “A good competitor is having tactics, knowing kour [parkour], having kour experience, being physically strong and physically fit.”
O’Carroll: “That stamina has got to be up there. Like cardio, focusing on your breath is one of the main things. It’s the same as any sport, you look at the best fighters in the world; if you keep yourself under control, keep breathing and getting that oxygen in, then your muscles have the power; without that, you just fall over.”
World domination, according to Christian and Damien: a global competition with the best teams and athletes from across the world. “We want to have an American qualifier, an Asian qualifier and a European qualifier, and then the winning teams will all qualify for the World Championships,” says Christian.


Diego Costa has hit out at Chelsea manager Antonio Conte and accused him of lacking “charisma” as the striker refuses to return to London, according to reports.
Costa,  Chelsea’s top scorer in the title-winning campaign last season, has been in Brazil throughout the summer after being told he was not needed by  Conte.
The  Italian coach was involved in an infamous text message exchange with Costa in which he reportedly told him he was not in his plans going forward.
In an interview with the  Daily Mail, Costa accused his manager of preventing him from signing a new contract at Stamford Bridge and claiming he is not close with any of his teammates.
“In January, things happened with the coach,” Costa told the  Daily Mail. “I was on the brink of renewing my contract, and they put the brakes on it. I suspect the manager was behind it. He asked for that to happen.

“His ideas are very fixed and clear. I have seen the sort of person he is. He has his own opinion, and that will not change.
“I respect him as a great coach. He has done a good job and I can see that, but as a person, no. He is not a coach who is very close with his players. He is very distant. He doesn't possess charisma.”
The 28-year-old said he is still in contact with some of his teammates, such as David Luiz and Cesc Fàbregas, and said he admired his successor at Stamford Bridge.
Chelsea signed Álvaro Morata from Real Madrid in a deal worth around £70 million (about $91 million) earlier this summer, with the Spaniard replacing Costa as Conte’s top striker.
He scored on his debut on Saturday but couldn’t prevent Chelsea from losing the first game of the season 3-2 to Burnley.
Next Sunday, Chelsea faces Tottenham at Wembley with a weakened squad due to injuries and suspensions, after Cesc Fàbregas and Gary Cahill were sent off.


Romelu Lukaku accomplished what Manchester United paid £75 million for on Sunday as Jose Mourinho’s team opened its Premier League season with a 4-0 victory over West Ham United.
Lukaku scored twice, once in the first half with a sweet finish in off the post to set United on the way to three points, the second a glancing header on 52 minutes to double his side’s advantage.
Mourinho kept a straight face at full-time but the Machiavelli inside the Portuguese manager, barely suppressed even at his sunnier moments, will surely have been cackling.
This was the weekend when Chelsea’s apparent off-field dysfunction gained physical manifestation, in a calamitous 3-2 defeat to Burnley at Stamford Bridge. Chelsea had two players sent off, too, and a grim weekend was compounded Sunday evening when the Daily Mail published an interview with exiled striker Diego Costa in which the Spaniard laid several heavy boots into manager Antonio Conte.
Lukaku could have gone to Chelsea, Mourinho’s former club, this summer and probably would have done so had it not been for the influence of his close friend Paul Pogba. United snuck in as quickly and as quietly as you can with £75 million in a suitcase and Chelsea turned to another of Mourinho’s targets, the Spain and Real Madrid striker Alvaro Morata. The strange merry-go-round may yet benefit both clubs—Morata scored on Saturday—but Lukaku’s swagger suggests he was born to wear United’s shirt. Certainly, he did not appear cowed by the occasion and his partnership with Pogba could be a prolific one.
Behind Lukaku, a man recruited from Chelsea looks as though he could be just as important to whatever United achieves this season. Mourinho told the BBC following Sunday’s game that he had been surprised at Nemanja Matic’s availability for £40 million. Last week Conte described losing the Serbian midfielder as a “great loss” and Matic’s Premier League debut for United will not have changed his opinion.
Matic was a key figure in Lukaku’s first goal, winning the ball from Pedro Obiang midway through the United half and allowing Marcus Rashford to race forward to set up the Belgian. Matic dictated the pace of the game, playing the ball simply and quickly forwards. That enabled Paul Pogba freedom in a more advanced role to cause damage, as he did by sliding in United’s fourth goal on 90 minutes.
Mourinho and United will have plenty more difficult tasks than this one through the season—West Ham was a supine opponent. But with Chelsea already stumbling, this was something of a statement of intent. Lukaku and Matic have added pace, power, skill and control to United. Mourinho’s gain is his old club’s great loss.


Liverpool manager Jürgen Klopp will bid for Napoli forward Lorenzo Insigne if he needs to replace Philippe Coutinho, according to reports.
Liverpool’s most creative spark last season, Coutinho may be on his way out of Anfield this summer and heading for Catalonia.
The club's owners released a statement on Friday insisting that Coutinho would not be for sale after reports that  Barcelona was willing to pay £120 million ($156 million) for the 25-year-old. But hours later, Coutinho delivered a transfer request to  Liverpool.
Now, despite Klopp’s and his club’s resolve about holding onto their star player, they will have to consider a potential replacement should Coutinho end up leaving, and Insigne is a possibility.
According to the  Daily Mirror, Klopp has long been an admirer of 26-year-old Insigne, who plays in a similar position to Coutinho and scored 20 goals in Serie A last season. He is reported to be valued at around £60 million ($78m).

Like Liverpool, Napoli says Insigne is not for sale, with the club facing the start of the Italian season next weekend and a Champions League campaign. But should Liverpool give in to selling Coutinho, it would have enough financial might to prize Insigne from Napoli.
There is still the possibility that Liverpool will hold onto Coutinho, as he is not the only man lined up by Barcelona as a potential replacement for Neymar, sold to Paris Saint Germain for £198 million ($257 million) earlier this month.
Ousmane Dembélé, the Borussia Dortmund striker, is being considered and has also shown a strong interest in moving to the Nou Camp. Last week, Dembélé failed to turn up for training with Dortmund or get in contact with the club. Each team has until August 31, when the transfer window closes, to resolve the situation. 


LeBron James has often shown himself to be an athlete unready to bury his head in the sand when it comes to social justice.
James proved that again when he tweeted an apparent criticism of President Donald Trump’s actions and words regarding the events in Charlottesville, Virginia, after a white nationalist protest resulted in violence and the death of a woman.
“It's sad what's going on in Charlottesville. Is this the direction our country is heading? Make America Great Again huh?! He said that,” James wrote, referring to Trump’s 2016 electoral campaign slogan.

Trump has been widely criticized by both Republicans and Democrats for his failure to single out white nationalists for blame over the clashes that resulted in the death of Heather Heyer, an anti-fascist protester. Trump spoke of violence “on many sides” after white nationalist groups descended on Charlottesville for a “Unite the Right” march against the proposed removal of a statue of Confederate Army General Robert E. Lee.
Trump’s daughter and close adviser Ivanka went further than her father in her criticism, labeling the far-right protesters in Charlottesville as “white supremacists and neo-Nazis.” Mike Pence, the vice president, condemned the marchers in quotes reported by The Hill on Sunday evening but defended Trump’s response. “We have no tolerance for hate and violence, white supremacists or neo-Nazis or the KKK,” Pence said. “The president also made clear that behavior by others of different militant perspectives are also unacceptable in our political debate and discourse.”
James is not the only athlete to speak out over the events in Charlottesville. Chris Long, the Philadelphia Eagles defensive end, called the far-right protesters “man babies” in a tweet posted on Saturday. Long attended high school in Charlottesville and went to the University of Virginia.
“Obviously, people ask, ‘You’re from Charlottesville?’ [and] it kind of leaves a bad taste in their mouths thinking that one of their guys is from Charlottesville, where they see all these rallies and stuff happening,” Long’s brother and fellow NFL player Kyle said. “Like I said, don’t let a few bad apples ruin what is really true about Charlottesville and that area—there’s good folks there.”

In February, James, 32, was presented with the NAACP’s Jackie Robinson Sports Award for “high achievement in athletics and contributions in the pursuit of social justice, civil rights and community involvement.” The LeBron James Family Foundation, founded by the Cleveland Cavaliers small forward in 2004, works in his hometown of Akron, Ohio, to mentor inner-city children through school.


Premier League managers had the first chance to see how their new squads were working together this weekend, and where their weaknesses lie.
Manchester United set the early pace with a 4-0 win over West Ham, while Watford held Liverpool to a 3-3 draw at Vicarage Road and Burnley beat Chelsea 3-2 at Stamford Bridge, with Antonio Conte's side finishing the game with nine men. Chelsea's holes were plain to more than just managers.
But now the clubs have an opportunity to bring in some last-minute reinforcements in the next three weeks before the transfer window closes. Here,  Newsweek takes you through all the news and rumors swirling around the Premier League today:
Manchester United's pursuit of Inter Milan winger  Ivan Periš​ić has rumbled along throughout the summer without much success, and now José Mourinho has competition. According to the  Daily Mirror, Chelsea has shown an interest in the 28-year-old winger and will make a late move this August.
As part of a spending spree, Chelsea will also bid £50 million for Southampton center back  Virgil van Dijk, the  Daily Star reported, after the Dutchman released a statement last week saying he wanted to leave St Mary’s for a bigger club. Liverpool has always been the expected destination for van Dijk, but Antonio Conte hopes to pip his Premier League rival to the signing.

After drawing 3-3 with Watford on Saturday, Jürgen Klopp said he will need to bring some new additions to his Liverpool squad before the transfer window closes on August 31, according to the  Liverpool Echo.  Van Dijk and RB Leipzig midfielder  Naby Keïta have both been at the top of Klopp’s wish list this summer, but he has had no success landing either.
Tottenham may make Lazio's Keita Baldé its first signing of the summer, stepping up its interest in the 22-year-old forward after he was left out of the Supercoppa Italiana squad this weekend, according to the  Daily Mirror. Mauricio Pochettino’s club is yet to spend anything in this transfer window.
Finally, Swansea manager Paul Clement has said he wants to see the transfer window closed before the Premier League season begins, as he continues to fight to hold onto  Gylfi Sigurðsson, a target for Everton, reported the  Daily Mail.


After two months off, the Premier League finally returned this weekend, after more than £1 billion was spent trying to improve its teams.
In the past week, however, many of the teams in England’s top tier have been preventing their best players from leaving, in addition to bolstering their squads.
Newsweek  guides you through the highlights of the week:   
Monday
After Chelsea lost the Community Shield to Arsenal, Antonio Conte was looking to add depth to the champion’s squad. The Italian’s team was rivaling Manchester United for Gareth Bale, who was believed to be available should Real Madrid land Kylian Mbappé. In Liverpool, Jurgen Klopp was giving up on his pursuit of Southampton defender Virgil van Dijk, while Barcelona was growing increasingly confident it would be able to sign Philippe Coutinho from Anfield for around £120 million, to be Neymar’s successor at the Nou Camp.
Tuesday
Twenty-four hours after Barcelona’s message of confidence over Coutinho, Klopp put his foot down, saying he would block any potential move. Liverpool had another boost when van Dijk released a statement saying he wanted a move away from Southampton, with Liverpool set to bid £60 million for the center-back. Chelsea and Manchester United were competing again, but this time for Serge Aurier, the Paris Saint-Germain right-back.
Wednesday
After losing the Super Cup final to Real Madrid, a game Gareth Bale featured in, José Mourinho admitted that signing the Welshman this summer was unlikely. But United had positive signs from PSG that Ivorian right-back Aurier would be available to sign. In west London, Antonio Conte was looking to sign another left-back, with Tottenham’s Danny Rose at the top of his wish list, while Inter Milan was considering a bid for Leicester City’s Riyad Mahrez.
Thursday
Chelsea was once again after an Arsenal player, swooping for English midfielder Alex Oxlade Chamberlain with a £35 million bid. But Conte’s team faced competition from United for Spurs left-back Danny Rose, while Mourinho was still keen on signing Inter Milan’s Ivan Perišić. Reports in France also suggested that Serge Aurier had agreed a five-year deal to join Manchester United. West Ham was willing to break its transfer record after bidding £25 million for Sporting Lisbon midfielder William Carvalho.
Friday
Liverpool looked to end speculation over Coutinho leaving Anfield by releasing a statement saying he would not be sold. Ousmane Dembélé, of Borussia Dortmund, looked most likely to be Neymar’s successor at Barcelona instead, after failing to turn up at the German club’s training session. In north London, Arsenal made a last-ditch attempt to keep Alexis Sanchez at the Emirates Stadium by offering him a £300,000-a-week contract, which would make him the highest paid player in the Premier League.


When the owners of Liverpool Football Club, Fenway Sports Group, issued a statement on Friday morning, a feeling of relief would have flown over Jurgen Klopp.
“We wish to offer clarity as regards our position on a possible transfer of  Philippe Coutinho,” it read. “The club’s definitive stance is that no offer for Philippe will be considered and he will remain a member of  Liverpool Football Club when the summer window closes.”
The statement followed Barcelona’s strong pursuit of the Brazilian midfielder this summer, willing to pay around £120 million (about $156 million) to take him to the Nou Camp. Having sold Neymar to Paris Saint-Germain for £198 million, Barcelona needs a successor;  Coutinho and Borussia Dortmund’s Ousmane Dembélé have been at the top of the list.
But  Liverpool’s strong stance will prevent it from being Coutinho, which will come as a relief to Klopp. Yet, after managing to fend off interest in one of his star players, reports in Italy now suggest the German faces a fight to keep hold of another of his midfielders.
According to  Gazetta dello Sport, Serie A champion Juventus is preparing an £23 million offer for Emre Can, the German midfielder who has become an integral part of Klopp’s team.

With less than one year remaining on his contract at Anfield, Can will be free to talk to clubs in January about a move away from the Merseyside club.
Last month, however, Klopp insisted the club had “good talks” with the 23-year-old over the summer about a new contract.
“You can imagine we're involved in talks, and we all feel good and confident in this moment,” he told the  Liverpool Echo.
“That means they're not the worst talks, but until anything is done or signed there's nothing to say.
“Emre is a very important player for us. We don't want to sell or lose players who are in our first lineup or close to it.”
For now, Can will be part of Klopp’s Liverpool squad when it travels to Hertfordshire on Saturday to face Watford in the team’s opening game of the Premier League season.


Arsene Wenger has admitted that Arsenal is “not super optimistic” that it will be able to keep hold of star striker Alexis Sanchez beyond this season, according to reports.
Sanchez heads into the 2017-18 Premier League campaign with just one year remaining on his contract, meaning he will be free to talk with other clubs in January.
Arsenal has not given up on agreeing a new deal with Sanchez, but according to  SFR Sport, Wenger has said he is not confident that the 28-year-old will extend his contract.
The  Daily Mail says Arsenal is making one last-ditch attempt to keep Sanchez by making him the highest paid player in the Premier League. The deal would be worth £300,000 a week.
Wenger says that Sanchez will not feature in  Arsenal’s opening game of the season, against Leicester City on Friday night, and may miss the clash with Stoke City the following weekend. Sanchez, the Frenchman says, is suffering with an abdominal issue.
Related:   Arsenal faces fresh attempts to lure star striker
Manchester City and Chelsea are both reported to be keen on signing Sanchez, but Arsenal is not willing to sell to a Premier League rival. By January, however,  Arsenal will have no choice over his future.
German giant Bayern Munich is also reported to be interested in signing Sanchez, with Carlo Ancelotti keen to add the former Barcelona forward.
Arsenal, meanwhile, will begin the season without Sanchez, but new signing Alexandre Lacazette is set to make his Premier League debut. The Frenchman signed from Lyon for a club record £46 million (about $59 million).


The summer transfer window, as it always does, has left the Premier League’s biggest clubs in a precarious position.
As they try to recruit new players to strengthen the team, they also have to fend off any interest in their star players. There is always the potential of finishing the summer in a weaker position.
And that will have been the fear for  Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp, who has dipped into the transfer market but could also lose his star player. Arsenal is in a similar position.  Tottenham, too. And the biggest stories of the transfer round-up today address this issue of loss rather than gain.
Here,  Newsweek  guides you through all the new and rumors you need to know from Thursday’s transfer market:
After weeks of uncertainty at Anfield surrounding  Philippe Coutinho, Liverpool has had a major boost. The Brazilian midfielder was a target for Spanish giant Barcelona, supposed to be a successor to Neymar, sold to Paris Saint-Germain for a record £198 million earlier this month. Barca was willing to pay £120 million for Coutinho.
But the La Liga club is also interested in Borussia Dortmund’s  Ousman Dembele, who didn’t turn up to training on Thursday and looks likely to complete the move to Spain.  Spanish football expert Graham Hunter believes Barcelona would be unable to buy Coutinho as well as Dembele, which will ease Klopp and the Kop’s concerns greatly.
In north London, Spurs fears an exodus after  Danny Rose’s comments on Thursday. The English left-back, who has been linked with a move to Manchester United, said Tottenham was not paying him what he is worth. The  Daily Mirror says Daniel Levy is now battling a pay crisis while  The Sun says Rose received a “hero's welcome” from his teammates when he returned to training.

Just down the road, at Arsenal, Arsene Wenger is making a last-ditch attempt to get Chilean striker  Alexis Sanchez to remain at the club, with his contract set to expire at the end of the season. Arsenal, the  Daily Mail reports, will make Sanchez the highest paid player in the Premier League to get him to stay, paying £300,000 a week.
West Ham is set to continue its ambitious spending this summer. After signing Joe Hart and Javier Hernandez, Slaven Bilic’s team has bid a club record £27.1 million for 25-year-old Sporting Lisbon midfielder  William Carvalho, according to the  Daily Telegraph.


Ivorian defender Serge Aurier has agreed to a five-year deal to join Manchester United from Paris Saint-Germain (PSG), according to reports.
Although  Jose Mourinho’s club is yet to agree on a fee with PSG,  Goal says Aurier has completed personal terms with  United and will be at Old Trafford stadium until 2022.
The 24-year-old will provide more options for  Mourinho at right-back, with Antonio Valencia currently filling the role and Matteo Darmian also an option.
There are, however, two issues for United to deal with before Aurier can complete the move. The first is a fee with PSG, and the second is ensuring he can get a visa to be eligible to enter and play in the United Kingdom.
Last November, Aurier was denied entry to England ahead of PSG’s Champions League clash with Arsenal, due to a  two-month suspended prison sentence he received in September for assaulting a police officer.
Related: Old Trafford favorite on verge of Manchester United return
Aurier has been playing at the Parc des Princes in Paris for two years, after signing from Toulouse in 2015, and he has won two Ligue 1 titles, three Coupes de la Ligue and three Coupes de France.
But the French giant brought former Barcelona defender Dani Alves to Paris this summer from Juventus, leaving Aurier down in the pecking order.
The signing would see  Mourinho’s quota of four signings completed, with Aurier following Victor Lindelof, Romelu Lukaku and Nemanja Matic to Old Trafford.
But the United manager has also said he wants to see a new winger signed, someone capable of cutting in to join the attack. Inter Milan’s Ivan Perisic has been the player most linked to a move to fill that hole.


Most reasonable folks with a modicum of boxing—or Mixed Martial Arts, for that matter—knowledge expect Conor McGregor to get soundly schooled by Floyd Mayweather, Jr, when the two meet in Las Vegas on August 26.
Most except, uh,  Conor McGregor, apparently.
On Tuesday morning, McGregor posted a seemingly ordinary training picture to his official Instagram account, showing the Irish UFC lightweight champion about to start hitting the heavy bag.
The eye is drawn up the wall, above McGregor’s head, to a painted mural of a green-gloved fist striking a boxer in the face.
In typical McGregor style, he’s already trash talking, albeit in an understated way .
Of course, it’s probably not just for show. McGregor is as meticulous in his preparation as he is flashy outside the gym and this way he gets to see Mayweather’s face every time he spars, skips rope or hammers that heavy bag.
There’s a nice level of detail to the picture, too. McGregor’s left hand is rearranging Mayweather’s face—perhaps the best chance the Crumlin man has of causing one of the biggest upsets in combat sports history at T-Mobile Arena later in the summer.

In another Instagram shot posted overnight giving a better view of the mural, McGregor called himself a “filthy Irish animal.”

The braggadocio has started early although trash talk and murals are unlikely to help McGregor if Mayweather begins to dance around him as is his style in the ring. To land the kind of shot that knocked out Jose Aldo—the kind depicted in the mural—McGregor is going to have to get close to Mayweather. Against a man of “Money’s” consummate boxing skills, that spells danger, quite possibly in the form of a K.O.
Still, at least there’s one person in the world who thinks this fantasy fight isn’t a foregone conclusion. Let’s see if visualization techniques can genuinely help McGregor pull off the greatest of all shocks.


Cristiano Ronaldo will not be leaving Real Madrid to join Manchester United or any other club, according to club president Florentino Perez.
Ronaldo, the four-time Ballon d’Or winner, reportedly wanted a transfer away from Real and out of the country after being accused by Spanish prosecutors last week of defrauding tax authorities of €14.8 million (about £12.9m/$16.5m).
But Perez, the newly reelected president at the Bernabeu, said he had not spoken to  Ronaldo since the Champions League final in Cardiff, Wales, last month, but insisted the Portuguese forward would not be leaving the club.
“Nobody at Real Madrid is contemplating that Cristiano will go,” Perez told Spanish radio station Onda Cero, as quoted in  The Times.
“He is a Real Madrid player and will remain so. I haven’t spoken to him. I have only heard what a newspaper has said. It is very strange. Life brings you unexpected situations, but you have to face them and find a solution. Cristiano is a good guy. I have a good relationship and a good friendship with Cristiano and I want to talk to him. When the Confederations Cup finishes [on July 2], we will deal with the issue.”
Jose Mourinho coached Ronaldo at Real Madrid from 2010 through 2013, and reports suggested the two could be reunited at  Manchester United this summer in what has been described as a “£183 million mega deal.”
Related:   Manchester United ‘Plots £183 Million Mega Deal’ to Sign Cristiano Ronaldo
Ronaldo has also been linked with a move to the wealthy French Ligue 1 club Paris Saint Germain, but Perez insisted that there had been no approaches from clubs.
“I have never told Cristiano to bring me an offer,” he added. “We are delighted with him as a person and as a player. If Cristiano wants to leave Madrid, it will not be for money. We have not received any offer for Cristiano, nor for [Álvaro] Morata [the striker wanted by United] or James [Rodríguez]. PSG’s owner [Nasser Al-Khelaifi] is a friend of mine. He hasn’t called me and I haven’t spoken to anyone.”
“I will always defend Cristiano as a footballer and as a person. He is a very good person. It has affected me how the news of Cristiano was treated in the media.
“The presumption of innocence was not respected. I am sure that Cristiano fulfils his fiscal duties. It must be a confusion that will be clarified. I am sure he would not want us to pay his fine if there was one. He is not like that.”


Kevin Durant is going to restructure his deal with the Golden State Warriors to take less money, according to reports.
That’s very bad news for anyone who thought the  Warriors might pose less of a threat in the new  NBA season.
According to  ESPN, Durant will voluntarily become an unrestricted free agent on July 1 before immediately re-signing with the Warriors. Durant was due a salary of $27,734,405 in 2017-18 according to  Spotrac but he will take around $4 million less than than the maximum available to him.
The reason? Durant may end up a little less rich but the Warriors should then have the capacity to re-sign Andre Iguodala, who hits the market as an unrestricted free agent this summer. The 28-year-old former Oklahoma City Thunder forward wants to win, repeatedly, in the Bay Area and it seems he is willing to delay a long-term deal in search of more championships.
Alongside negotiating Iguodala’s deal, the Warriors will also have to pay out this summer on a new contract for Stephen Curry expected to total more than $200 million across five years. After four years of making less than perhaps his performances deserve, the point guard will sign one of the NBA’s new Designated Player Veteran Contracts.
In theory, the Warriors’ core could have started to break up this summer. But Durant’s reported decision means the juggernaut will likely go on, at least until the subject of Klay Thompson’s contract extension comes up again next summer.
Somewhere in northeast Ohio, LeBron James is quietly banging his head against the wall. If James wants to win another championship with the Cavaliers, or even, as rumored, in the western conference with the Los Angeles Lakers, he will have to accomplish it against the same lineup that ended the Cavaliers’ championship hopes in 2017.


The city of Manchester dominates much of the news and rumors this morning as Jose Mourinho and Pep Guardiola look to improve their respective squads for next season.
In today’s round-up, the future of Cristiano Ronaldo, plus his potential terms for a reunion with Mourinho at Manchester United, takes a turn, while Guardiola’s Manchester City looks for  another  striker.
United is also on the hunt out for a new goalkeeper and midfielder, and reports today suggest the club isn’t looking very far to fill each department.
Liverpool’s ongoing chase for former Chelsea forward Mohamed Salah is included in the round-up, and it’s good news for Jurgen Klopp’s team. Here,  Newsweek  guides you through all the latest on Tuesday morning:
Mixed messages are found in today’s reports regarding  Ronaldo.  The Sun says the Portuguese forward will not hold United to ransom over his wage demands, but Mourinho isn’t even interested in signing the 32-year-old forward, according to the  Daily Star.
Mourinho is, however, interested in two players from rival teams. He will battle West Ham for the signing of Manchester City goalkeeper  Joe Hart, according to the  Daily Telegraph, and is looking to raid his former club Chelsea to bring midfielder  Nemanja Matic to Old Trafford,  The Sun says.
City may be keen to part company with Hart, having loaned him to Torino last season, but it is the attacking department that Guardiola continues to improve at the Etihad Stadium.  Sky Sports say that the Spanish coach is preparing a bid for Borussia Dortmund forward  Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang.
City and Liverpool are two of the teams believed to be in the race to sign  Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain from Arsenal, but now, according to the  Daily Mirror, Chelsea has also made the English midfielder a target this summer.
A player who could be on the way out of Stamford Bridge is 20-year-old midfielder  Izzy Brown, who spent last season on loan at Huddersfield and could be about to join the club permanently. The  Daily Mail say the newly promoted club will offer £8.5 million for the Chelsea player.
Barcelona is activating a £10.5 million buy-back clause for Spanish forward  Gerard Deulofeu that the club put into a deal with Everton, according to the  Daily Mail.
Swansea City is among the clubs looking to sign  John Terry after he left Chelsea at the end of last season. The 36-year-old defender is linked with a variety of English clubs, including Bournemouth, Birmingham and Aston Villa, but  The Mirror says Terry has now held talks with Swansea.


Tiger Woods said on Monday he is receiving "professional help" to manage his use of the medications he takes to relieve back pain and insomnia following his arrest for driving while intoxicated last month. 
Florida police found the 41-year-old asleep behind the wheel of his vehicle in the early hours of May 29. He tested negative for alcohol after his arrest and later released a statement saying he had experienced an unexpected reaction to prescription medicines.
"I'm currently receiving professional help to manage my medications and the ways that I deal with back pain and a sleep disorder," he posted on Twitter on Monday. 
"I want to thank everyone for their amazing outpouring of support and understanding especially the fans and players on tour." 
Woods is the winner of 14 major championships, second only to Jack Nicklaus, but has hardly played in the last 22 months after undergoing multiple back surgeries.


Among the reactions to UFC fighter Tim Hague’s death, perhaps the most sobering came from Anthony Johnson.
Hague died at age 34 on Sunday, having  reportedly fallen into a coma following a boxing match in  Edmonton, Canada, on Friday.
Hague, who fought five times in the UFC, was knocked down five times in the first two rounds by opponent Adam Braidwood, the  BBC reported.
The Canadian, who had also been an elementary school teacher, fought 34 times in Mixed Martial Arts and lost eight of those contests by knockout. He then began a boxing career in which he was knocked out in two of his four fights.
On Saturday, former UFC light heavyweight champion Johnson posted on Instagram, saying Hague’s death was a “reality check” for him.
“This is why I walked away. This is a reality check for me!” Johnson wrote. “I've knocked a lot of ppl out and idk how this didn't happen when I fought. I've been afraid of this happening to me and after learning about CTE I'm afraid of it happening to anybody.”

Johnson, 33, left the fight game on his own terms in April, following a submission defeat to Daniel Cormier at UFC 210.
Hague wasn’t so lucky.
Known as “The Thrashing Machine,” Hague was an imposing six foot four and 264 pounds, according to  Sherdog.com.
That website also shows Hague suffered, often, for his art. After opening his MMA career with ten wins from 11 contests, he lost 12 of his next 23 fights. Eight of those defeats came by technical knockout or by knockout.
Hague boxed professionally for the first time on December 9, 2011, according to  BoxRec, winning by knockout.
He fought three more times as a boxer, losing his last two bouts by technical knockout.
YouTube footage of Hague's fateful fight shows him knocked down four times before Braidwood knocks him out, his head appearing to smash into the ring surface as he falls.
His tragic death was confirmed in a statement issued by his family.
"It is with incredible sadness, sorrow and heartbreak to report that Tim has passed away," the  statement released Sunday said.
"He was surrounded by family, listening to his favourite songs," they added. "We will miss him so greatly. We ask for privacy during this difficult time."
Hague’s passing seems likely to lead to uncomfortable questions. Why was a man with a lengthy history of knockouts still allowed to fight? Should boxing’s stoppage rules come under review? Had Hague been fighting in MMA, the contest would likely have been over following the first knockdown. And why was a fight that Hague was clearly losing, badly, not halted when it became clear he could no longer defend himself?


Former Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard believes Jurgen Klopp needs just two or three signings this summer to win the Premier League title for the first time in the club’s history.
Liverpool finished fourth in the top tier of English football last season, 17 points off champion Chelsea and just one ahead of Arsenal.
But Gerrard, who now works as a coach in the club’s academy, believes  Klopp needs a few additions and a change of tactics against rigid opposition.
“I think we've got a fantastic manager at the helm, who will hopefully attract a few big names to complete the jigsaw," Gerrard told  BT Sport. "I think Liverpool are very, very close and if you look at the statistics of the top six from last season, they were the best team in terms of head-to-head.
“So Liverpool know where they need to improve and it's consistency against the teams in the bottom half of the table—the teams that sit narrow, compact and are difficult to break down.”
Virgil van Dijk looked likely to become  Liverpool’s first signing of the summer earlier this month, but the club ended its interest and apologized to Southampton.

Now, former Chelsea winger Mohamed Salah, currently at Roma, is reported to be Klopp’s top target. But Roma is believed to want more than the £35 million  Liverpool is said to have offered.
Gerrard thinks one of the first priorities is in defense. “I think we need someone in the left-back position. James has done a fantastic job out there, but it would be nice to have another option out there as well,” he said.
“And maybe one more attacking player to give some more firepower and help unlock the defenses that are really narrow and compact. I don't think we need major reconstruction, I think it's just a couple of pieces of the jigsaw left and I'm really happy with where we are at the moment.”


The night before he battered his ball for the fourth and final day around the wide fairways of Erin Hills, Brooks Koepka took a phone call from Dustin Johnson.
“Dustin actually called me on Saturday night and told me to take one shot at a time, just to stay patient,”  Koepka  said. “It was a case of ‘just keep doing what you’re doing, you’re going to win the thing. Just don’t get ahead of yourself’.
“It was a long phone call for us; it was like two minutes. But he just said a few things, about just staying patient. And that I’ll win if I stay patient and just keep doing what I’m doing.”
It must have worked. Koepka stayed patient and calm and outlasted the field, including a charging Hideki Matsuyama and Rickie Fowler, who fell away to finish tied for fifth in another major disappointment.
Down the field and out of view, Johnson had the quietest of tournaments for a man usually surrounded by noise of the good and bad variety. The 32-year-old ended the weekend in Wisconsin tied for 92nd.
There was drama as Koepka produced a final round of 67 to hold off Brian Harman, the 30-year-old Georgian, albeit of the purists’ variety. Harman’s previous best finish in a major was tied for 26th at the British Open in 2014. Besides the enigmatic Fowler and Matsuyama, the top ten was made up from a collection of American journeymen and those with more promise than fame, in Justin Thomas and Xander Schauffele.
They would never admit as much, but one wonders whether the good members of the United States Golf Association might have secretly wished for Johnson, and not the impressively unflappable Koepka, to be on the end of the pep talk on Saturday evening.
Koepka’s path is unusual enough that he may be more familiar to a European golf public than his countrymen. Born in West Palm Beach, he attended Florida State University before making his way through the Challenge Tour and then the European Tour.
There may be more majors to come for Koepka—as there may for Danny Willett, who shot an 81 then withdrew before the start of the second round with back pain.
They are two of the past seven major winners. Each of those tournaments have been won by a different man, dating back to Jason Day’s victory at the PGA Championship at Quail Hollow in 2015.
There is an argument that a level, almost random playing field increases excitement in a tournament. It also, indisputably, makes rivalries difficult to form and sustain.
There was no chance for a final-day shootout on Sunday between Rory McIlroy and Jordan Spieth. The American finished strongly but McIlroy had long since missed the halfway cut, before getting drawn into an unseemly  Twitter spat with Steve Elkington.
In the post Tiger Woods-void there were possibilities for a group of elite players to establish hegemony. It seems the opposite has happened, which creates a headache for anyone attempting to sell a golfer as Woods was sold for so many years before scandal and injury put buffers on his career. The best thing for Koepka, of course, would be to go on a run of victories in majors. Perhaps it would be best for the game of golf, too.


When Brooks Koepka won his first career major at the U.S. Open at Erin Hills on Sunday, he was greeted by his delighted team.
Among them was his girlfriend Jena Sims, an American actress, who embraced Koepka as he walked off the 18th green after shooting 16-under-par for the tournament, tying a  U.S. Open record.
For Fox Sports viewers, though, there was some confusion. Commentator Joe Buck incorrectly identified Koepka’s girlfriend as professional soccer player Becky Edwards. To make things even more awkward, Koepka had dated Edwards but the two broke up earlier this year.
Co-commentator Brad Faxon was on hand to correct Buck. Take a look:

The relationship between Koepka and Sims was fairly unknown before the major championship in Wisconsin. Then she posted this:

And this:



Shortly after John McEnroe approached Donald Trump’s box at the 2015 U.S. Open, the president only a Republican candidate at the time, the former tennis star ended up leaving very confused.
He’d known Trump “a little over the years.” In 2000, Trump offered $1 million to see McEnroe play either Serena or Venus Williams but none of the players had shown an interest. He had called McEnroe his “dear friend.” “[That was] news to me,” McEnroe told  The Sunday Times.
McEnroe’s father, however, was a fan of Trump. “In fact, my dad—also called John—had written to Trump at the start of his campaign for the Republican nomination, asking if there was anything he could do to help,” McEnroe recalled.
And it was this letter that caused the confusion when McEnroe approached Trump’s box at quarterfinal of the tournament between the Williams sisters at the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center.
“Donald has a box at the U.S. Open, right next to the broadcasters’ booth. At the 2015 tournament I went over to say hello, against the advice of my wife and daughter: ‘Don’t you dare go over there. He’s a misogynist and a blowhard—it could hurt your reputation.’ Sure enough, it was caught on TV, me hugging Donald like we were long-lost brothers.
“He did seem more pleased to see me than usual, and I only realised why when he said, ‘John, thank you so much for the letter. I’ve got it on the wall in my office!’ I hoped this was fake news. I didn’t want everyone who went into Trump’s office thinking I was his No. 1 fan.”
Before the election, McEnroe revealed he would be voting for Hillary Clinton but described the two presidential nominees as “not the best you could have.”


This is hardly the first time that Ronaldo has reportedly been unhappy at Real Madrid. Every time, it seems, his former club Manchester United is mentioned as a possible retirement home.
This time, though, could it actually happen that  Ronaldo returns to the team he left in 2009?  Sky Sports News claimed on Monday morning that the  Portuguese player was “interested” in a return to United.
Would that even be a good idea? It’s certainly a tempting one for United but there are plenty of reasons why it doesn’t make sense...
Ronaldo is 32 and while his dedication to diet and training means he probably has longer left at the top than most of his contemporaries, there are no guarantees when a footballer reaches his mid-30s.
Can United risk tying Ronaldo down to a long-term deal, only for him to suffer a serious injury at some point in that contract? You could say the same for almost any signing but younger players have a chance to recover and still reach their peak. Ronaldo is cresting his—he’s been round about it for years, a mark of his greatness—but the only way from here is down. Does United really want to be saddled with an ailing great?

Which is, or would be, ridiculous even for modern transfer fees. Talk of a £132 million fee is one thing—that would obviously be a world record—but Ronaldo’s wages are a reported £365,000 at Real and he’s unlikely to accept much less at Old Trafford. The fans may see it as a nostalgic move and there may be a touch of that for Ronaldo but for club and player, this would be a commercial proposition. United can expect to make a lot of money out of a Ronaldo return just in shirt sales.
But that’s still an awful lot of money going out on someone the wrong side of 30. Real may spend a similar amount on one transfer this summer, on A.S. Monaco’s Kylian Mbappe. Mbappe, though, is 18 and has his whole career ahead of him. United could risk looking like it is desperately harking for the past. It would be an expensive slice of nostalgia.
Transfers don’t take place within a vacuum. If Real was forced to sell Ronaldo then that would almost certainly change its strategy for the summer.
For instance, United has reportedly been close to sealing a deal for Real striker Alvaro Morata for weeks. But what happens if Real loses Ronaldo and with him 40 guaranteed goals in all competitions? United may find it suddenly unwilling to sell any more players. And what, then, for the prospect of David De Gea to the Spanish capital?
Of course there are caveats here. If United buys Ronaldo it may no longer want—or be able to afford—Morata. If Real sells Ronaldo then it may just free up more funds for Mbappe. Still, there are obvious complications here that could affect United’s transfer business even past this summer window.
There’s nothing wrong with big egos in a squad but too many can risk upsetting a carefully-crafted balance. Last summer’s world-record purchase of Paul Pogba suggested Mourinho wanted to build a team around the France midfielder. Pogba is also a dominant presence and character within the dressing room. Would adding Ronaldo to the mix cause United’s team spirit more harm than good? The danger is that Mourinho ends up with a situation like at Real, where player power and factions grow more powerful than the manager. It’s why “super teams” invariably work better on FIFA than in real life.
Few United supporters begrudged Ronaldo his then world-record move to Real in the summer of 2009, given what he achieved under Sir Alex Ferguson.
Ronaldo’s United legacy remains almost pristine. What, exactly, could he do to improve upon it? He’s won a Champions League with United, he has Premier Leagues, League and F.A. Cups.
Perhaps there is the desire on his part to prove he can still dominate the Premier League into his 30s. With that desire—hubris even—comes the danger that Ronaldo’s performances could head south in his second spell at Old Trafford. He might then be remembered, at least in part, as a broken-down, aging relic, rather than the raging thoroughbred he once was. And that would be a shame.




When you’re the offspring of LeBron James, you can expect a better-than-average birthday party.
Bryce Maximus James, the youngest son of the  Cleveland Cavaliers  small forward, turned 10 on June 14.
On Sunday, James put up a video on Instagram showing the kind of wild time you can have when you’re the son of the world’s best basketball player.
A James birthday party apparently involves mini American football games, basketball, of course, and ice-throwing competitions.
James even got in some training, dunking over a group of kids half his height, if that.
As reports and rumors swirl over James’ future in Cleveland past the summer of 2018, it looks at least like he’s putting any thoughts of the new NBA season and stopping the Golden State Warriors’ juggernaut off for now.



Whether it was a dive or a push, there was certainly an Oscar in there somewhere.
Former Chelsea midfielder Oscar, who moved to Shanghai SIPG in January, was involved in an incident Sunday that sparked a mass on-pitch brawl.
The Brazilian was at the heart of a feisty game with Guangzhou R&F in the Chinese Super League that ended 1-1.
But the game could have been abandoned when Oscar went down over a challenge that saw most of the 22 players on the pitch, as well as coaches and substitutes get involved in a mass melee.
Oscar moved to SIPG, coached by former Chelsea manager Andre Villas-Boas, for £40 million and has been one of the standout players for the Super League team.
SIPG is second in the table, four points behind leader Guangzhou Evergrande.
Watch the fracas here:



Reports that Cristiano Ronaldo wants to leave Spain this summer shocked the football world and sparked speculation of where the Real Madrid striker will move.
The destination could be Manchester United, Real Madrid, China or even the United States. But there is plenty more going on in the transfer market today, or plenty more rumors and whispers, anyway.
Chelsea is looking to wrap up its first deals of the summer after potentially falling behind title rivals, while a Liverpool offer has fallen short putting the deal in danger of falling apart.
Here,  Newsweek takes you through all the deals you need to know about this Monday morning:
First, to the Premier League champion. Chelsea is yet to sign a player this summer, but the  Guardian reports this morning that Antonio Conte’s club will look to wrap up two deals this week. Juventus left-back  Alex Sandro and Monaco central midfielder  Tiemoue Bakayoko are the two players Conte wants to bring to Stamford Bridge.
A former Chelsea player has been on the radar for Liverpool since the Premier League season ended.  Mohamed Salah, of Roma, is the target of a £35 million offer from Jurgen Klopp’s club, according to  Sky Sports, but the offer does not meet the Italian team’s asking price and Liverpool will not increase the fee.
Should United lose Spanish goalkeeper  David de Gea to Real Madrid this summer, Jose Mourinho has lined up a replacement. According to  Calciomercato  via  Metro, Mourinho wants 18-year-old Italian goalkeeper  Gianluigi Donnarumma from AC Milan.
Former Premier League champion Leicester City is considering an offer for West Brom center back  Jonny Evans, according to the  Daily Telegraph.
Bournemouth’s  Joshua King has been linked with a move to Premier League runner-up Tottenham Hotspur and the 25-year-old striker has said he is flattered by the news, according to the  Bournemouth Echo.
At Arsenal, speculation has grown over the future of English center back  Calum Chambers after the defender dodged a question over his future at the Emirates Stadium, according to the  London Evening Standard.


Following are five key moments that helped Pakistan win the Champions Trophy for the first time with a crushing 180-run victory over holders India at The Oval in London on Sunday.
Pakistan captain Sarfraz Ahmed loses toss: 
India have done well chasing down targets so captain Virat Kohli opted to put his rivals in to bat first. 
It proved to be a good toss to lose as Sarfraz said he would also have elected to field if he had won it. 
"We wanted to bowl first. But the toss is out of our control. Hopefully, we can post more than 300," Sarfraz said.
Pakistan opener Fakhar Zaman is caught by Mahendra Singh Dhoni for three—off a no ball: 
With his bat tucked under his arm, Fakhar begins the long walk back to the pavilion as the Indians celebrate grabbing their first wicket with only four Pakistan runs on the board.
The celebrations swiftly change direction, however, when replays on the big scoreboard show that Jasprit Bumrah had bowled a no ball and Fakhar is called back to the crease. 
It proved to be a costly no ball as Fakhar goes on to score his first international century before falling for 114.
Kohli fails to capitalise on a dropped catch on five:
The Indian captain had come into the match with an astonishing batting average of 253 runs in this year's tournament, having been dismissed only once in four matches.
So when he was dropped by Azhar Ali in the slips off Mohammad Amir in the third over, huge cheers erupted around the arena. Pakistan made sure it did not turn out to be a costly mistake, though, as Amir dismissed him with the next ball. 
His departure proved to be a bad omen for the Indians as the only other time he had been dismissed in this year's Champions Trophy—against Sri Lanka in the group stage—the holders also lost the match. 
Amir back in the team after missing semi-final with back injury: 
Amir, once vilified for his role in the 2010 Pakistan spot-fixing scandal which led to him serving a prison term in the U.K., was at his brilliant best when he produced a devastating opening spell. 
He removed India's top three batsmen—Rohit Sharma (0), Shikhar Dhawan (21) and Kohli (5). 
After leaving India reeling on six for two following the dismissals of Sharma and Kohli, Amir's figures read 1.4 overs, four runs, two wickets. 
His transformation into a hero was complete as his final tally was six overs, two maidens, 16 runs and three wickets.
Hardik Pandya, India's last hope, run out for 76 after showering the ground with sixes:
Pandya came to the crease with India teetering on 54 for five after Yuvraj Singh and former captain Dhoni departed in quick succession. 
He raised hopes of pulling off a one-man Indian Houdini act as he hit three successive sixes to reach his half century. But just when it seemed that he was blazing towards a first international century, he was run out after a mix-up with Ravindra Jadeja.
India still had three wickets in hand but the deafening cheers from the Pakistan fans made clear that the end was nigh.
India lost their last four wickets for the addition of only six runs. 


Manchester United is preparing for one of the biggest deals in world football that would see Cristiano Ronaldo return to Old Trafford, according to reports.
Ronaldo, the four-time Ballon d’Or winner, reportedly wants to leave Spain this summer and United is among the clubs that he could move to, along with Paris Saint Germain.
According to the  Daily Mail, Italy’s  Tuttosport  reports that Jose Mourinho’s club will offer £183 million (about $234 million) for the 32-year-old Portuguese forward that would include other exchanges.
United’s original summer target Alvaro Morata would also be a part of the deal. Mourinho wanted a striker to replace Zlatan Ibrahimovic at Old Trafford, and Morata reportedly topped that list.
Real reportedly wanted £70 million for Morata but United will now look to put the 24-year-old Spaniard into a deal with Ronaldo.
The offer would also include David de Gea, the United goalkeeper formerly of Atletico Madrid. Real has been targeting the Spaniard as a replacement for Keylor Navas at the Bernabeu this summer.
The deal appeared to have disappeared but United is now looking to use De Gea as a bargaining chip to get both Ronaldo and Morata to Old Trafford.
Manchester United has already secured the signing of center back Victor Lindelof this summer and has a number of other transfer targets.
Inter Milan’s Ivan Perisic is high among that list, with spending at United looking certain to climb above £200 million (about $255 million).


It is unlikely to get much mainstream exposure in the United States, but that doesn’t mean there won’t be plenty of people across the 50 states tuning into what is likely to be one of the most-watched, if not the most-watched, global sporting events of 2017. Renewing a sporting rivalry that puts almost all others in the shade, India will take on its neighbor Pakistan Sunday in the final of cricket’s ICC Champions Trophy, a scaled-down, elites-only version of the World Cup.

To get a scale of just how big the occasion is, when the two teams met in the 2015 World Cup, in what was just a preliminary game, an estimated worldwide audience of one billion people tuned in. This time a trophy will be on the line.
But the sporting prize is just a part of what will make the occasion such a spectacle and so intense.
India and Pakistan rarely compete at cricket, the game which dominates both the sporting and cultural landscape in both countries. That has been the scenario since heated political tensions between the two were dramatically exacerbated by the Mumbai attacks in 2008. The attacks were carried out and orchestrated by Pakistanis, who India accused the Pakistan state of supporting and later shielding.
Cricketing relations were soon cut and ever since the two teams have met only sporadically, almost exclusively when they are compelled to face off in major tournaments.
In recent months, relations have taken a further downward turn as a result of frequent clashes over the Line of Control in the contested region of Kashmir. During that time, Pakistani actors have been banned from Bollywood, while Indian films were forbidden from being shown in Pakistan. Cricket is now one of the few vehicles that bring people of the two countries together, albeit there will be little togetherness on show in the heart of the battle in Sunday’s final at London’s Oval cricket ground.
While the vast majority of those tuning in will be among the huge populations in India and Pakistan, not completely insignificant number are also likely to be watching from the United States. There are, after all, more than three million Indian-Americans in the U.S. and several hundred thousand Pakistani-Americans.
The sport’s governing body has made a recent push to try to grow the game in the U.S. In 2015, a group of retired legends played three matches across the country, in New York City, Houston and Los Angeles, with each game drawing over 20,000 fans. And when India and Pakistan met in last year's World Cup for the shortened 20-over version of the game, the average audience in the U.S. was a non-too-shabby 1.4 million.
While far from every American household will be able to tune into the biggest cricketing occasion of 2017 on Sunday, the game, which is scheduled to start at 5.30 a.m. EDT, it will be shown on the subscription TV channel Willow, also available to live stream via Sling.


When India played Pakistan in the Cricket World Cup of 2015, a worldwide audience estimated at one billion tuned in.
That was just for a group game.
On Sunday the two countries will meet at The Oval in London, England, in the final of the  ICC Champions Trophy, a pared-down version of the  Cricket World Cup involving just the world’s top eight teams.
Pakistan, mixing inconsistency with occasional luminous brilliance under new captain and wicketkeeper Sarfaraz Ahmed, struggled to even qualify for a tournament that began doused in rain and will finish on the hottest weekend of the year so far. Then, the side ranked seventh in the world beat top-ranked South Africa at Edgbaston, Birmingham, and ignited a sodden competition. Pakistan advanced to the semifinals, where a powerful England team should have ended its run. Instead, a sublime bowling performance and a calm chase with the bat saw off the host country.
India, perennially excellent especially in limited-overs cricket, and in the biggest tournaments, suffered a shock defeat to Sri Lanka in the group stages before pummelling another neighbor, Bangladesh, in the semifinal.

The teams have already met once in the competition. At Edgbaston on June 4, an India team powered by captain and preeminent superstar Virat Kohli posted 319 for three, a total Pakistan could not begin to approach.
The suspicion is that Pakistan’s batting, frail even in the good times, will let down the tournament’s most talented bowling attack. India’s big-game nous should see it through to a second successive Champions Trophy victory.
But then, when India and Pakistan meet it’s risky to take anything as read. Partly, that is because they meet so seldom. The game at Edgbaston was the first since February 15, 2015, that World Cup group game. Between the World Cup semifinal in 2011 in Mohali and Saturday’s final, there have been just eight 50-over games featuring the sides. Pakistani players have not participated in the 20-over Indian Premier League since 2008, in the aftermath of the Mumbai bus attack India  claimed was planned from inside Pakistan by militants from that country.
The separation creates a feverish desire, and the febrile political atmosphere adds to the mixture. “As far as the Indians and Pakistanis go, I don’t think they watch this game as a game of cricket. It’s more of a border rivalry,” the India offspinner Ravichandran Ashwin  said before the countries met in the 2016 World Twenty20 in India. “They want to get one up on each other. There’s much more rather than this game taking center stage. As far as people are concerned, they put their emotions into the game.”
Before this tournament began, there were  clashes along the Line of Control between Indian and Pakistani Kashmir. The 2016 World T20 fixture was moved from Dharamsala, in India’s far north, to Kolkata in the east as Pakistan sought security assurances. None of these games can ever be divorced from a context far wider than sport.
That won’t be necessary, of course, in a tournament held in England. The atmosphere this time around seems more akin to a party than a proxy war. In Birmingham two weeks ago, both sets of fans danced during the rain breaks. Edgbaston, situated in a city where 19.5 of the residents are Indian or Pakistani, wants to host a series between the two on  neutral ground.
It’s all half a world or more away from the U.S. Open, that other great sporting event of the weekend. The closest golf in the 21st century gets to politics is Rory McIlroy playing a round with President Donald Trump.
That isn’t to say that Erin Hills won’t provide its own brand of visceral excitement. It’s just that, potentially, more than a tenth of the world’s population will have its eyes turned elsewhere.


There may still be eight weeks until the Premier League season starts, but English football’s biggest clubs are already busy trying to spend their millions.
After finishing outside the top four last season,  Arsene Wenger is busily trying to prevent his best players from leaving Arsenal while attempting to strengthen his squad with new additions.
Jose Mourinho has said he’s staying out of  Manchester United’s transfer business this summer. Yeah, sure he is. United has already wrapped up one signing and has been, apparently, chasing plenty more over the past week.
Here,  Newsweek  takes you through all the news, rumors and whispers circling the Premier League over the last five days.
Monday
Last weekend,  Manchester United confirmed the signing of Swedish center back Victor Lindelof from Benfica in a deal believed to be worth £30.7 million. On Monday, Jose Mourinho’s team was already looking to bolster his squad further, linked to  A.S. Monaco central midfielder Fabinho.  Chelsea, meanwhile, was yet to add to its squad after winning the Premier League but Antonio Conte was reported to want  Real Madrid’s James Rodriguez as a replacement for Cesc Fabregas. Much excitement about who was signing who was swirling around on Monday, but the only confirmation was 25-year-old Jon Nolan making the switch from  Chesterfield, which was relegated to League Two, to  Shrewsbury Town in League One.
Tuesday
Mourinho was back in the gossip columns on Tuesday, after a different midfielder. Mourinho was looking to weaken his former club  Chelsea  by attempting to sign Nemanja Matic, the giant central midfielder, as well as Blues target Tiemoue Bakayoko who currently plays for A.S. Monaco. United’s interest in Antoine Griezmann was brought to an end, while  Real Madrid’s  Alvaro Morata became the club’s main attacking target of the summer. Wenger, meanwhile, found out he would have to pay £60 million to sign the prolific Lyon forward Alexandre Lacazette, who has scored 91 goals in the last three seasons.
Wednesday
Lacazette remained on Wenger’s wishlist at  Arsenal , but on Wednesday he was joined by Kylian Mbappe and Thomas Lemar, both of  A.S. Monaco. Across London,  Chelsea  was looking to pounce on Willy Caballero, the Argentine goalkeeper released by  Manchester City at the end of last season, while Mourinho was also beginning the Old Trafford clearout. Chris Smalling was reported to be on his way out of  Manchester United while a change on the club website suggested Wayne Rooney’s exit was imminent.  Liverpool’s  long pursuit of former Chelsea winger Mohamed Salah seemed to take a positive turn when the Egyptian told  Roma  he wanted to leave the club and move to Anfield.
Thursday
From Morata becoming a clear  United  target on Tuesday, by Thursday there were suggestions that he could sign from  Real Madrid by next week.  Everton  had been named among the clubs that could sign Chris Smalling, along with  West Brom  and  West Ham. Gareth Bale’s turbulent season in Madrid brought speculation over whether the Welshman could push for a move away from the Bernabeu this summer, but Bale reportedly didn’t want to leave despite  United’s  interest. Alexis Sanchez’s future was again up in the air Thursday, with  Arsenal  desperate not to sell to a Premier League rival, such as  Manchester City  or  Chelsea. But the Premier League’s biggest spenders of the day—and week, it turned out—was  Everton as the club announced the £30 million signing of  Sunderland  goalkeeper Jordan Pickford and Davy Klaassen from  Ajax  for £23.6 million.  Leicester City  also had confirmation of a signing as Harry Maguire joined from  Hull City  after impressing during the last campaign.
Friday
Chelsea  was said to be back in the hunt for  Napoli  center back Kalidou Koulibaly, with the Italian club believed to have rejected a £53 million offer from the Premier League champion.  United  was after a new target, with Friday bringing news that Mourinho wanted Ivan Perisic from  Inter Milan, and he wanted him before the club went on its U.S. tour in July. The most staggering news of the week came on Friday afternoon when Cristiano Ronaldo’s future at  Real Madrid was thrown into doubt when multiple publications reported that the Ballon d’Or winner wanted to leave Spain. But to go where? Maybe we’ll be able to tell you next week.


Cristiano Ronaldo will seek to leave Real Madrid next month, according to a shock report.
Ronaldo, 32, has been at Real for eight years, during which time he has won the Ballon d’Or award for world’s best player four times.
But  A Bola in Portugal claims the star forward wants to exit Spain following the 2017 Confederations Cup with his national team, which takes place this June and July in Russia.
Ronaldo is facing a potentially fraught summer as Spanish prosecutors decide whether to pursue charges against him over allegations of tax fraud dating back as far as 2011. The player is apparently “disgusted” by the investigation.
Even as he enters the final phase of his career, there are only a select few teams Ronaldo could depart for.  A Bola reckons Paris Saint-Germain would be interested, and—deep breath—Manchester United would also like to take him back to Old Trafford.
Ronaldo is a very different player from the man who left United for a then world-record fee in the summer of 2009, but his powers of reinvention mean he is now perhaps even more threatening in front of goal.
Bringing him back to the place where he made his name would certainly be one of the most popular moves United manager Jose Mourinho could make. Ronaldo only signed a new five-year contract in November 2016, but if he were to become available, it’s difficult to imagine United not inquiring, if only politely, after his services.


The Golden State Warriors will resume their rivalry with the Cleveland Cavaliers when the new NBA season begins on October 20.
In the meantime, it appears LeBron James and Draymond Green are going to do their best to keep the pot bubbling.
Green, the Warriors’ starting power forward, trolled James on Thursday during the franchise’s championship parade by sporting a “Quickie” T-Shirt in reference to Quicken Loans Arena, the Cavaliers’ home.
James fired back on  Instagram, reposting the picture of Green and writing, “That’s what she said, HUH?!?!?"

But Green wasn’t done. Later at the championship parade he took to the stage and mocked James for his post-Finals claim that he “didn’t believe” in superteams and had never played for one.
“And can somebody give Bob [Myers, Golden State Warriors general manager] some f****** credit?” Green said. “They wanna talk about superteams this, superteam that. 'I never played on a superteam.' You started the superteam, bro. I ain't join a superteam. Hey Slim [Kevin Durant], I don't know what you just did Slim but you did something to them boys."
He then made fun of James’s new bald haircut, screen-shotting a clip from James’ video and posting it to his own Instagram. “Them dubs finally made him go bald!!! Congrats bro @kingjames.”

All in jest, maybe. But do Green and the Warriors really want to poke an already fired-up James?


The pressure on Arsene Wenger this summer is possibly greater than it’s ever been. After Arsenal failed to qualify for next season’s Champions League, Wenger has to retain the club’s best players this summer while recruiting others to propel the team up the table.
Alexis Sanchez could be heading for the Emirates exit. The Chilean forward was  Arsenal’s top scorer last season and is one of the best players in the team, but  Sanchez grew frustrated by Arsenal falling short of its  Premier League rivals. Mesut Ozil, also in the last year of his contract, could be set to leave Arsenal this summer, but  Wenger has at least had some good news.
Hector Bellerin, the 22-year-old right back, has developed into one of the club’s most exciting players, having joined from Barcelona’s academy in 2011, aged 16. Now, however, the Catalan club wants him back. A valuation of around £40 million (about $51 million) has been put on Bellerin but, according to a teammate, the Spaniard will remain at  Arsenal.
“He’s an Arsenal player and almost certainly he will stay here,” Nacho Monreal told Spanish newspaper  Mundo Deportivo , as quoted by the  Daily Mail. “Hector is a very important player for us and the boss has already reiterated that he counts on him.”
Monreal, the Arsenal left-back and Bellerin’s teammate with the Spanish national team, added: “Now they will have to negotiate between the clubs and we will see what happens but almost for sure he will continue with us.”
Wenger, meanwhile, is in the pursuit of players this summer to bolster his squad, with three fellow Frenchmen as his main target. According to  The Daily Telegraph, Monaco duo Thomas Lemar and Kylian Mbappe are on Wenger’s wishlist, as well as Lyon striker Alexandre Lacazette.
Lacazette is the kind of player Wenger has needed at the Emirates in recent years, having scored 91 goals in his last three seasons. But such scoring prowess is going to see Arsenal need to pay around £60 million for the 26-year-old.
If the club can convince Mbappe to join, he is also going to demand a big transfer fee, possibly even a world record. The 18-year-old was the star of Monaco’s Champions League campaign last season, taking the club to the semifinals of the competition. Arsenal faces competition for his signature, including Spanish giant Real Madrid.


Manchester United will have to pay £48 million if Jose Mourinho is to land Ivan Perisic from Inter Milan, according to a report published Friday.
Perisic, 28, has emerged as one of Mourinho’s principal transfer targets as he looks to add skill and pace to United’s counterattack.
But Inter has no need to sell, and  ESPN claims it is holding out for a huge transfer fee for the Croatia international. That could present a problem as United is reportedly only willing to pay £35 million, although Mourinho will surely be backed with the extra cash should Inter refuse to budge from its current asking price.
Arsenal’s pursuit of Kylian Mbappe, meanwhile — always a longshot — appears destined to end in failure after Real Madrid closed in on the prodigiously talented A.S. Monaco teenager.
Mbappe, 18, struck 26 goals last season as Monaco won Ligue 1 and reached the Champions League semifinals.
Those feats have caught the eye of Mbappe’s fellow Frenchman Zinedine Zidane, Real’s manager. Monaco and Real have held preliminary talks according to  Goal.com but with the French champion unwilling to sell Mbappe, his price could rise as far as a world-record £118 million.
Chelsea has been slow to match its rivals in the transfer market so far this summer, leading to reports of disagreements between Antonio Conte and the club’s board.
However, that could soon change as  The Telegraph claims Premier League champion Chelsea is all in for Kalidou Koulibaly, the Napoli center back.
Napoli has rejected a £53 million offer from Chelsea for the 25-year-old defender, though there remains plenty of time left to close a deal this summer.


A role-reversal seems to have taken place at Old Trafford this summer.
After  Manchester United secured the Europa League final on May 24, the team’s 64th game of a gruelling season that saw it win three trophies, coach  Jose Mourinho delivered a message to the club’s board.
He had done his job.  Mourinho had won silverware as well as returning Manchester United back to European football’s top table, the Champions League. Now, over the summer months, it was their turn to deliver with the signings Mourinho wanted.
“Ed Woodward [the United chairman] has my list, what I want, what I would like for more than two months,” he said, as quoted by the  BBC. “So now it’s up to him and the owners. But I don’t care about football for now.”
Mourinho went on to say that he was now “on holiday.” He said he was “fed up” and “tired of football” and that he wouldn’t be involved in transfer negotiations. It was a clear message that, if United didn’t get the players he wanted, the blame fell solely on the board, and, ultimately, Woodward.
The United chairman has had a positive start to the summer months. Before the transfer window even opened, United had announced the arrival of  Benfica center back Victor Lindelof for £30.7 million (about $39 million) to strengthen Mourinho’s back line. Goalkeeper David de Gea looks likely to stay at Old Trafford instead of signing with Real Madrid. And United is now chasing the services of striker Alvaro Morata, from Real, as a replacement for the released Zlatan Ibrahimovic. But Mourinho wants more.
According to the  Daily Mail, United will sign Inter Milan winger Ivan Perisic for £44 million (about $56 million), with the deal set to be confirmed within weeks. Although we are still only in the middle of June, the new season two months away, Mourinho wants the deal complete as soon as possible.
Mourinho, the report says, wants Perisic in a United shirt and ready to be part of the squad for its pre-season tour of America next month. The team will play five matches while in the States, including games against LA Galaxy, Manchester City, Real Madrid and Barcelona, traveling from California to Utah and Texas.
United’s first match, against the Galaxy at StubHub Center in California, is on July 15. Woodward now knows his deadline for keeping his employee, Mourinho, happy.


Some may say Erin Hills is a gamble from the United States Golf Association (USGA). On a mammoth 7,693-yard course, an incredibly heavy rough—sorry, fescue—lines a wide open fairway without any trees in sight, and known for its unpredictable gusts of wind. For some, the Wisconsin course looks more like the venue of a British Open rather than the 117th U.S. Open major championship.
In fact, Jon Rahm, the Spaniard who is ranked 10th in the  golfing world, described it as playing “like a links course on steroids.” He added, as quoted by  the BBC, “I think it’s [the] U.S. Open, they expect our best.”
And that’s exactly what the USGA will hope to see: the world’s best golfers, playing at their maximum on a course that is challenging but beatable. (Workers at Erin Hills cut the fescue back on holes four, 12, 14 and 18 this week after wet weather made it unplayable, organizers said.) The  U.S. Open needs to be entertaining this year, remembered for the entertainment on the course rather than the debacle off it.
Last year, in Oakmont, Pennsylvania, the world no.1 and favorite for this year Dustin Johnson held the shimmering trophy aloft on the 18th green as the new champion. Sure, the weekend had been good, Johnson shooting an impressive 69 to finish five under par, but it was the image of blazered officials approaching Johnson on the 12th tee that made the 2016 U.S. Open memorable.
Seven holes earlier, on the 5th green, Johnson’s ball moved slightly as he was about to make a putt. He was told there would be no penalty, but then, on the 12th, he was now told this could change.
Related:   Everything you need to know about the 2017 U.S. Open at Erin Hills
Officials at Oakmont were criticized for the uncertainty hanging over Johnson. Rory McIlroy wrote on Twitter: “No penalty whatsoever for DJ. Let the guy play without this crap in his head. Amateur hour by the USGA.” Regardless of how well Johnson played, the 2016 U.S. Open will forever be remembered for the controversy.
The year before that, in 2015, the Sunday at Chambers Bay in Washington saw  Jordan Spieth crowned champion. Spieth had shot five under par, winning the tournament at the age of 21, but his win was down to Johnson’s collapse. He three-putted on the final hole to lose by one shot, an anti-climatic end to the weekend that saw players complaining about the quality of the course.
You would have to go back to 2008, almost a decade ago, for the last classic at the U.S. Open. The 19-hole play-off between  Tiger Woods and Rocco Mediate at Torrey Pines will remain in the highlights packages for years to come, especially being Woods’ last major win.
So this year is big. Big for  Erin Hills as it looks to make a mark on the golfing world, and even bigger for the U.S. Open. It can’t afford another year of mediocrity.


So it’s actually, properly happening, in real life. Floyd Mayweather, Jr, versus Conor McGregor is no dream.
McGregor, UFC’s first dual-weight world champion, and undefeated boxer  Mayweather will meet in Las Vegas on August 26 for a boxing superfight that not so long ago appeared a fantastical idea at best.
There are plenty of reasons to be cynical about a bout that appears, at least on the surface, to be about money first, ego second, and sport a distant third.
But there are also reasons to be excited, even if the action itself seems an interminably long way away right now. Here are some of the factors to look out for.
Should Mayweather dance around McGregor and outpoint him by a wide margin—which seems the most likely result right now—Mixed Martial Arts is going to look pretty bad to a huge number of casual viewers on the world’s biggest stage.
That perception will be highly unfair, of course. McGregor would surely take Mayweather within a round or two were this a UFC venture. What said casual viewer will see, however, is the world’s most famous Mixed Martial Artist appearing technically inferior to the world’s most renowned professional boxer.
On the other hand… should McGregor land the sweet overhead left that has done for so many of his opponents in UFC, it’s boxing that looks terrible. Bear in mind that no boxer has knocked Mayweather down since Carlos Hernandez did it in 2001. McGregor’s movement will be unique among fighters Mayweather has faced and beaten but it would still be a shock, and a boon for MMA, if he stopped the American.
While the actual purse is the subject of a confidentiality clause, we do have UFC president Dana White’s words from April to fall back on. “If the fight sells as well as I think it can, Floyd makes a little north of $100 [million] and Conor makes $75 [million],” White told  The Herd podcast.
As ever with a Mayweather fight, at least in the second half of his career, there is a lurid fascination with the vast sums of money that the fight will undoubtedly gross.  Forbes predicts this could become the highest-grossing boxing match of all time, with both Mayweather and McGregor earning over $100 million for their efforts.
That’s music to the ears of Mayweather—whose nickname is “Money,” after all. And whether McGregor makes $75 million or $100 million or even more, this stands to be the biggest payday of his career by a distance.
It’s not just the fighters that have a lot riding on this fight. UFC president Dana White tweeted a smile on Monday evening to signal his delight at the deal being done, and there is no doubt that White stands to benefit from another significant move from MMA, and UFC, into the mainstream.
Equally, and aptly for a fight being held in “Sin City,” White has taken a gamble. McGregor—the undisputed face of UFC since Ronda Rousey lost her unbeatable aura—has not fought in UFC since he stopped Eddie Alvarez for the lightweight belt in November 2016.
White will make sure that the UFC name is prominent in the run-up to August 26 but by the time the dust has settled, it will have been almost ten months since McGregor last stepped into the Octagon. White says McGregor will turn around and fight again in UFC before the end of the year but that’s still a hefty period of inactivity for the face of a promotion.
Mayweather has perfected the art of luring people into parting with cash in the hope of seeing him get pummeled.
It’s a strategy that works, principally, because Mayweather is so good at selling an obnoxious personality. Without his ability to talk himself up, often in the third person, his supreme defensive skills would be admired by purists instead of infuriating those casual pay-per-view buyers who tune in to see him receive a comeuppance that never seems to arrive.
McGregor has something of Mayweather’s extraordinary brashness, though he’s an offensive fighter where Mayweather is the master at slipping punches for 12 rounds. We have already seen a little of what to expect from the build-up to the fight, when McGregor tweeted a picture of Floyd Mayweather Sr, Mayweather’s uncle, none too subtly suggesting that his 40-year-old opponent is over the hill.
The noise is only going to get louder over the next two months. Neither Mayweather or McGregor will ever approach the poetry of the great Muhammad Ali but in modern combat sports their voices carry the furthest of anyone. We’re about to find out what happens once they start shouting at each other.


Manchester United is nearing a deal for Inter Milan winger Ivan Perisic, according to a report.
Inter had reportedly been demanding £50 million for the Croatia attacker with  United unwilling to meet that price.
But the  Manchester Evening News claims Perisic’s advisers are now confident he will move to Old Trafford this summer, with the opportunity of playing Champions League football next season a major factor in his decision.
Left wing, where Perisic plays, is a key area of need for Mourinho as he seeks to turn United into a credible challenger for the Premier League. The Portuguese stationed Anthony Martial out there last season, but would prefer a natural left-footer to provide balance especially when United counterattacks.
Like rival Manchester City, United appears to be conducting much of its most important transfer business early in the summer, before prices can become inflated by increasingly desperate clubs. On Wednesday evening it was confirmed that the club had completed the signing of Victor Lindelof, the Benfica defender, for £31 million.
In addition to Lindelof and Perisic, Mourinho ideally needs a defensive midfielder to free up the attacking talents of Paul Pogba, and a striker. United is understood to be in talks with Real Madrid over a deal for Alvaro Morata but as with Perisic, the two parties have yet to agree upon a fee.


No decision has been made yet over whether the NBA Finals champion Golden State Warriors will visit President Donald Trump at the White House, a team statement reads. But Steph Curry knows what he wants to say.
Curry starred in the series, combining with Kevin Durant to score 41 points in Game 5 on Monday, and beat the Cleveland Cavaliers 4-1 for the Warriors second championship in three years.
Usually, the NBA champions are invited to the White House to meet the president, an event that tends to take place at some point during the following season. But speculation has centered whether  the Warriors would refuse a meeting with Trump.
Coach Steve Kerr called Trump a “blowhard” and said he “couldn’t be more ill-suited to be president.” A decision has not yet been announced, but  Curry has made his feelings clear.
“Somebody asked me about (going to the White House) a couple of months ago, like a hypothetical, if the championship were to happen would I do it and I think I answered 'I wouldn't go'. I still feel like that today,” he said, as quoted by  USA Today. "But, obviously as a team, we're going to have a conversation.
“This is a moment we all need to enjoy together and nothing should distract what we were able to accomplish together. The different kind of ceremonies and traditions that have happened around championship winning teams, we don't want that to taint what we've accomplished this year.
“So we'll handle that accordingly and responsibly and do the right thing for us individually and as a group.”
Curry and the Warriors did visit the White House the last time they won the championship, in 2015, but that was to visit the former president, Barack Obama.


For the third year in a row, LeBron James powered the Cleveland Cavaliers to the NBA Finals.
For the second time in two, the  Cavaliers fell short against a  Golden State Warriors team fast establishing itself as among one of the best of all time. That may be enough to get James moving again.
James’ legacy as a Hall of Famer is surely already secure but aged 32 his window on a fourth Championship may be closing. The Cavaliers can expect to win the Eastern Conference again next season, even with an improving Boston Celtics team, but Golden State will likely still present too high a hurdle in the Finals.
One solution? James, whose contract with the Cavaliers expires in 2018, could move out west according to Adrian Wojnarowski, host of basketball talk show  The Vertical Podcast with Woj.
“Not only is there no guarantee he’s coming back, I’m not sure there’s an expectation he’s re-signing there [with the Cavaliers],” Wojnarowski said. “I think they feel, I think within Cleveland and around the league, they feel that he’s very much in play to leave again and likely head out West to one of the two L.A. teams. The Lakers could very well be a target.”
Wojnarowski added that the Miami Heat, with whom James won his first two NBA Championships, could also be a possibility.
Of course, by moving out west James would encounter Golden State before the Finals. But the Lakers, who seem likely to pick UCLA point guard Lonzo Ball second overall in the upcoming draft, would offer intriguing possibilities and allow James to pursue his interests outside of basketball in the city.
Another option among many—James stays with the Cavaliers who sign a superstar to play alongside him and Kyrie Irving, dragging Cleveland closer to Golden State in the offseason. Whatever happens, as always with James, it will be must-watch.


Another day, another batch of transfer news and rumors.
Manchester United is, of course, set to spend big this summer and has already announced the signing of Victor Lindelof for £31 million. In today’s transfer roundup, United could announced its second incoming next week.
Elsewhere, Manchester City is having a clearout during the offseason in order to bring in some more players, while Arsenal tries desperately to hold onto Alexis Sanchez.
Here,  Newsweek  takes you through all the whispers going around the Premier League on Thursday morning:
Manchester United could announce the signing of  Alvaro Morata as early as next week, according to the  Daily Mirror, as the the 24-year-old makes a £65 million move to Old Trafford.
But it seems United defender  Chris Smalling is heading for the exit at Old Trafford, with Everton, West Brom and West Ham keen on the English center back, according to  The Daily Telegraph.
West Ham is also chasing another English target. The club is looking to pounce on the news that Manchester City does not want to keep  Joe Hart this summer, so the Hammers will look to take him on a season-long loan, the  London Evening Standard says.
Plans from City for a big-spending summer will require a clearout. Hart is a likely departure and the  Manchester Evening News says  Kelechi Iheanacho could also be sold, valued at £25 million.
City is one of the clubs keen on taking  Alexis Sanchez from Arsenal this summer, along with Premier League champion Chelsea, as the Chile forward heads into the final year of his contract. But according to  The Independent, Arsenal will resist selling to its rivals.  
Manchester United has also shown interest in Real Madrid forward  Gareth Bale but the Welshman, who moved to the Bernabeu in 2013, does not want to leave the club, the  Daily Mail says.
The  Daily Mail is also reporting that Arsenal target  Kylian Mbappe, the 18-year-old sensation at Monaco, will have to “sort” through his offers this summer, as Arsene Wenger’s club is not the only suitor. Mbappe said this week that Real Madrid had been trying to sign him since he was 14 years old.


The Golden State Warriors found themselves at the center of both the political and basketball universe in the days since they captured their second NBA title in three years. Unconfirmed reports stated the team had unanimously decided not to visit President Donald Trump’s White House, a perceived protest and admonition of the Republican and a tradition that’s seen all of the country’s four major sports’ champions enjoy the West Wing.
Owner Joe Lacob said the team had yet to be invited at all, and that it would decide in the future to attend if asked.
The hot-button controversy seemed to be over, until the comments made by Warriors forward Andre Iguodala to USA Today before Golden State clinched the title Monday in Game 5 of the NBA Finals.
The 33-year-old swingman, known as a ferocious defender and dunker as well as being socially conscious, suggested it’s possible Trump may not even be in the White House by the time the team potentially heads to Washington D.C. and that a scheduling conflict could eventually lead to the country’s buzzy aspersion, “fake news.”
“Maybe (Trump) doesn’t (invite us) and we don’t go, or we don’t say anything and make a big deal of it, and he doesn’t make a big deal of it and we go our separate ways,” Iguodala said, though the report noted he’s also known to be sarcastic.
“Y’all might write about it. I might call him and say, ‘If they ask, just say our schedules conflicted.’ And then if y’all write something, we’ll say, ‘Fake News,’” Iguodala said.
He also added that the team will go with whatever decision leader and two-time league MVP Stephen Curry makes. Though he also said “hell nah” when asked about his taking part in the visit.
“We’re going to do what our leader (Curry) does,” Iguodala said. “I think we handle (the White House situation) when it gets there. I mean, it may be different. There might be somebody different in (office). That’s a realistic thing to say though, right? So you don’t know what’s going to happen.”
Iguodala also said he believed that Trump has made the racial divide in the country worse since he was sworn in.
“We all know (that it is getting worse),” he said. “I think it’s just the ignorance, the convenient ignorance. (It’s) not to say that people aren’t aware, but they just don’t want to address it (because) they don’t want to be attached to it so they ignore a lot of the bad things that happen. I feel like there are actions that occur, that continue the dividing of everyone. And I think that’s done on purpose.”
The issue has been a bed of controversy for the Warriors this season, though not necessarily from Iguodala. Golden State head coach Steve Kerr often blasted Trump and his policies, saying last month that Trump is a “blowhard” who was “ill-suited” for office.
And in February, Curry took umbrage with the chief executive of one of his sponsors, who claimed Trump was a “real asset” to the country.
Under Armour CEO Kevin Plank made the comment to which Curry shot back later: "I agree with that description," Curry said, "if you remove the 'et'" from asset. ”
Some members of the Super Bowl-champion New England Patriots refused their White House visit and ceremony earlier this year. 


Arsenal’s attempts to sign Lyon striker Alexandre Lacazette this summer have been hit by the Lyon club’s preference to sell to a French rival, according to reports.
Lacazette, who scored 36 goals in 44 games last season, is believed to be high on  Arsene Wenger’s list of transfer targets this summer.  The Daily Telegraph says Wenger is also keen on Kylian Mbappe from Monaco and his teammate Thomas Lemar.
But Lyon would prefer not to sell the 23-year-old forward to  Arsenal, or any other club in England, the club’s president Jean-Michel Aulas told France Football, as quoted by the  Daily Mail.
In a bizarre move, Aulas suggested Lyon would be happy to sell Lacazette to the likes of Paris Saint Germain or another club in Ligue 1, as he urged owners to invest in French football.
“I know Nasser suggested to Noel Le Graet [president of the French Football Federation] that he is not investing that much in French players, because he thought other presidents of French clubs looked badly upon it,” Aulas said.
Related: Mourinho begins clearout, and Wenger targets French stars in today’s transfer roundup
“I want him to know that if he makes an offer for Alexandre at least equal to that of the other clubs bidding for him, then Alex can go to Paris without problem.
“I am a businessman and a modern club president. Transfer money must be reinvested into French football, as I always did when we were at the peak of our powers.”
Aulas added, “When transfer money is shared abroad, it strengthens our competitors instead.”
Wenger will also do well to bring Mbappe, the 18-year-old starlet who took Monaco to the Champions League semifinal last season, to the Emirates Stadium this summer.
Wenger faces competition from Spanish giant Real Madrid, which is reportedly willing to pay a world-record sum for the talented forward.
There is hope for Wenger, however, as Didier Deschamps, the France national team coach, has warned players not to move to a club where they will not play regularly, a concern for Mbappe should he move to Real Madrid’s Bernabéu.


After spending the day with Emmanuel Macron, British Prime Minister Theresa May joined the French president at the Stade de France on Wednesday night.
The stadium in Paris hosted a friendly football match between the two leaders’ countries following qualifiers for the  2018 World Cup in Russia.
May sat alongside  Macron for the game, watching England take the lead through Harry Kane but, in the end, coming out on the wrong end of a 3-2 scoreline to a youthful, but incredibly talented French team coached by Didier Deschamps. England lost despite France going down to 10 men when Raphael Varane was sent off two minutes into the second half.
May has also seen her team lose men recently, after her Conservative party lost a majority in the British parliament following the country’s general election on June 8. But May, who remains Prime Minister, was happy enough to get involved in a Mexican wave during the game.

As Manchester United prepares for another summer of spending in the summer, Jose Mourinho’s team has to make room for its new additions.
In today’s round-up, we look at who is likely to be heading out the exit door at  Old Trafford, while  Arsene Wenger makes three France internationals his priority to sign at  Arsenal.
Chelsea is also in the news as it swoops on a Manchester City outcast, while clubs are fighting for the services of a former Blues players. Here,  Newsweek  guides you through all the news and rumors:
Chris Smalling will be one of those players heading out of Manchester United, according to  The   Daily Telegraph, with West Ham, West Brom and Everton believed to be keen on signing the defender.
A change on the club’s Facebook page has also suggested the future of  Wayne Rooney has been decided, the  Manchester Evening News has reported.  Rooney had, originally, been featured alongside Jesse Lingard, Paul Pogba and Ander Herrera on the club’s banner but the 31-year-old has been removed, with a departure from Old Trafford expected.
Arsenal boss Wenger has shortlisted three France internationals for the summer transfer window, according to  The Daily Telegraph. These include 18-year-old  Kylian Mbappe, also a target for Real Madrid, his Monaco teammate  Thomas Lemar and Lyon’s prolific striker  Alexandre Lacazette.
But there are also fears at the Emirates Stadium that  Alexis Sanchez will not sign a contract extension with one year left on his deal. According to the  Manchester Evening News, Manchester City believes it will be able to sign the Chile forward for £50 million if he refuses to extend his stay at Arsenal.
Across London, at Stamford Bridge, Chelsea has pounced on City’s decision to release goalkeeper  Willy Caballero .  ESPN say the 35-year-old Argentine will become backup to Thibaut Courtois.
Former Chelsea captain  John Terry’s future is still uncertain. Aston Villa was reported to be keen on signing the 36-year-old center back, but has now been joined by Midlands rivals in chasing his signature. According to  The Times, Birmingham City is in the race for Terry and  Sky Sports say West Brom has begun talks with the former England captain as well.
Liverpool target  Mohamed Salah has told Roma that he wants to leave the Italian club and move to Anfield this summer, according to Sky Italia, as reported by  Liverpool Echo. Salah, a 24-year-old Egyptian winger, spent two years at Chelsea but made just 13 appearances.
A former Anfield favorite,  Pepe Reina, could be on his way back to the Premier League. Newly promoted Newcastle wants to sign the 34-year-old goalkeeper currently playing at Napoli, according to the  Newcastle Chronicle.


Human Rights Watch (HRW) said Wednesday it had documented cases where workers building venues for Russia's 2018 soccer World Cup had been left unpaid, made to work in dangerously cold conditions, or suffered reprisals for raising concerns.
Soccer's world governing body, FIFA, announced a monitoring system in 2016 for labor conditions at Russia's World Cup stadiums, and says the system has helped improve labor standards.
But in a statement accompanying the New York-based campaign group's report, Jane Buchanan, HRW's associate Europe and Central Asia director, said:
"Construction workers on World Cup stadiums face exploitation and abuse, and FIFA has not yet shown that it can effectively monitor, prevent, and remedy these issues."
FIFA said that "while incompliances with relevant labor standards continue to be found—something to be expected in a project of this scale—the overall message of exploitation on the construction sites portrayed by HRW does not correspond with FIFA's assessment."
A spokesperson said this assessment was based on quarterly inspections conducted by independent experts and trade union representatives.
FIFA also said that it was Russian authorities who "ultimately have the responsibility to protect human and labor rights on their territory and ensure that construction companies are held accountable".
Russia is set to host the World Cup next summer in 12 stadiums spread across 11 cities, including Moscow, St Petersburg, Kazan and Sochi.
These four cities are set to host matches in the Confederations Cup, a two-week tournament kicking off Saturday that will feature world champions Germany, the various regional champions and the host country.
Russia's World Cup organizing committee was not available for immediate comment. In May, Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko told TASS news agency that construction works at the stadium in St Petersburg were in compliance with FIFA requirements and that workers' rights were not being violated.


Rory McIlroy turned from excited to flabbergasted on Tuesday after the world No. 2 was told that U.S. Open officials had decided to mow down some areas of the tall fescue that frames the fairways at Erin Hills.
Four-times major winner McIlroy, one of the game's best drivers of the golf ball, had just spoken with reporters about how eager he was to attack the long, links-styled, rolling farmland course off the tee.
However, he was left incredulous when informed that some of the fescue lining the generous fairways was being mowed.
"Really? We have 60 yards from left line to right line," an exasperated McIlroy said. "You've got 156 of the best players in the world here. If you can't hit it within that avenue, you might as well pack your bags and go home.
"These are the widest fairways we've ever played in a U.S. Open. Even the first and second cut (of rough) is another 10 yards on top of that."
Some players in the field for the year's second major that gets underway on Thursday had grumbled about how hard it was to advance the ball out of the fescue that stood almost knee high.
Early on Tuesday morning, U.S. Golf Association officials told a small group of reporters that areas of fescue would be mowed because the tall, thin grass was laying down due to the heavy rains that hit the area on Monday night and into Tuesday.
"I get that it's thick and whatever, but it's a hazard," McIlroy said. "It's a U.S. Open, it's supposed to be a tough test. And if guys can't put it into play within a 50-yard zone, I don't think they've got much to complain about."
McIlroy, who has played sporadically this year due to a rib injury, said he believed the 7,741-yard Erin Hills course suited him.
"I don't feel like it's a secret that I feel like my driver is one of the biggest weapons in my bag," said the 2011 U.S. Open winner at Congressional.
"I wasn't crying when I saw that rain last night and this morning. It's a long golf course and it's only going to play longer. That benefits a few guys, and luckily I'm one of them."


LeBron James has sparked speculation over his future—particularly whether he will remain with the Cleveland Cavaliers—after the team lost the NBA Finals Monday night.
Golden State Warriors secured  the title by winning Game 5 129-120 at Oracle Arena to take the series 4-1, the team’s second in three years.
Despite being on the losing side,  James was one of the stars of the Finals, scoring 41 points in Monday’s game. But he refused to confirm whether he would remain with the Cavaliers.
Asked about his future in the league, he said, as quoted by  The Guardian: “For me personally, I don’t know. I need to sit down and figure this thing out. And so I don’t know as far as me personally right now.”
“For me personally, I left everything on the floor every game, all five games. So for me personally I have no reason to put my head down. I have no reason to look back at what I could have done or what I shouldn’t have done or what I could have done better for the team.”

That was backed up by the numbers.  James became the first player in NBA history to average a triple double in the NBA Finals after scoring 41 points with 13 rebounds and eight assists on Monday. He ended the series averaging 33.6 points, 12 rebounds and 10 assists.
Having joined the Cavaliers from the Miami Heat in 2014, there is a suggestion that he could be on the move again, with the Los Angeles Lakers one of  the rumored destinations.
Wherever he ends up, James is sure the Warriors will be back to defend the championship title.  
“They’re going to be around for a while,” he added. “Pretty much all their guys are in their 20s. Pretty much all their big-name guys are in their 20s, and they don’t show any signs of slowing down. So there’s going to be a lot of teams that’s trying to figure out ways to...match that if they’re able to actually face them in the playoffs.”


Updated | The Golden State Warriors said Tuesday they have not decided whether they will go to the White House following their NBA Finals victory. "Today is all about celebrating our championship," the team said in a statement. "We have not received an invitation to the White House, but will make those decisions when and if necessary."
Reports surfaced early Tuesday morning that the team had "unanimously" decided to forgo a visit to the White House, a tradition for the NBA championship-winning team. "I can't believe we're getting this question already," owner Joe Lacob said Tuesday. "But honestly, that's something we'll worry about at the time. That's a long time from now."
After the New England Patriots won the Super Bowl earlier this year, six players ended up announcing they would not be visiting the White House to celebrate the win with the president. Even President Donald Trump's favorite athlete, Tom Brady, dropped out at the last minute, which pretty clearly hurt the president's feelings.

Shortly after the Warriors won Monday night, sportswriter Richard Deitsch tweeted that "there is zero chance this @warriors team is going to the White House." Attached to the tweet was a quote from Warriors forward David West, who in January spoke out against Trump.

"All the tactics he used to get elected are the very things that someone like me, who works with youth on a consistent basis, are the things we try to talk our young folks out of being," he said. "We try to talk our young people out of being bullies. We try to talk our young men out of disrespecting women. We try to talk our young people into being accepting of other people's opinions and other people's walks of life."
West isn't the only member of the Warriors to speak up. Stephen Curry, the team's clean-cut superstar, voiced his opinion on the president after Under Armour CEO Kevin Plank called Trump "a real asset" to the nation. Curry is the brand's marquee endorser, but he doesn't quite agree with its CEO. "I agree with that description," Curry said of Plank's comments, "if you remove the 'et' from asset."
In February, guard Shaun Livingston said he "definitely wouldn't go" to the White House if the team were to win the championship. "I really feel that my views would keep me from going and visiting," he continued. "Just with everything that's going on right now. I just don't agree with a lot of stuff that's happening."
Livingston also said that the decision to visit the White House would ultimately rest in the hands of head coach Steve Kerr. "At the end of the day, it would be his decision, and I think we would talk about it as a team, as we usually do. We would come together, and it would be a panel of us, and we would really sit down and talk about it," he said. "Everybody would give their own opinion and have their own side, and I think he would leave that up to each individual."
As the NBA season has coincided with Trump's election and first few months in the White House, the league has emerged as staunchly anti-Trump. The prevailing sentiment seems to be one of opposition, and two NBA figures have led the charge, San Antonio Spurs coach Gregg Popovich and Kerr. Both have been refreshingly outspoken in their views on the president, delivering rant after rant when asked by reporters about Trump's latest news-making decision.
"I have no idea what kind of president he’ll be because he hasn’t said anything about what he’s going to do," Kerr said after the election. "We don’t know. But it’s tough when you want there to be some respect and dignity and there hasn’t been any. And then you walk into a room with your daughter and your wife, who have basically been insulted by his comments, and they’re distraught. Then you walk in and see the faces of your players, most of them who have been insulted directly as minorities, it's very shocking. It really is."
After Trump announced his travel ban plan, Kerr spoke about his father's killing by gunmen in Beirut (Islamic Jihad, a precursor of Hezbollah, claimed responsibility) but said he disagreed with the president. "If we're trying to combat terrorism by banishing people from coming to the country, we're really going against the spirit of what our country is about, and [we're] creating fear. It's the wrong way to go about it. If anything, we could be breeding anger and terror. I'm completely against what's happening. It's shocking. It's a horrible idea."
In May, Kerr called Trump a "blowhard" who "couldn't be more ill-suited to be president."
There's little doubt that his comments have emboldened his players to take stands of their own. Athletes are conditioned to be tight-lipped to the media, especially when it comes to politics. Trump's divisiveness has made it more acceptable for players to voice their opinions. It shouldn't come as a surprise if other speak up when asked about the team's potential decision to forgo the traditional victory trip to the White House, and it isn't hard to imagine the team "unanimously" coming to that decision enthusiastically over some champagne in the early hours of Tuesday morning.
This story was updated with the Warriors' statement that they have not decided on a White House visit following their NBA Finals victory​.


Jose Mourinho will target Chelsea’s  Nemanja Matic ahead of Fabinho, the A.S. Monaco midfielder, according to a new report that suggests a change in Manchester United’s transfer plans that could upset a fierce Premier League rival.
United was thought to be in for the 23-year-old but the  Manchester Evening News claims Matic, the  Chelsea enforcer, is more likely as Mourinho seeks a way to release Paul Pogba’s creativity.
Major transfers between Premier League rivals can be fraught but with Chelsea reportedly targeting Monaco’s dynamic Tiemoue Bakayoko it seems Matic could be surplus to manager Antonio Conte’s plans.
It seems, though, that the prospect of Mourinho signing  Antoine Griezmann has disappeared altogether.
Griezmann, the 26-year-old France striker, has agreed a new deal with Atletico Madrid that will keep him in the Spanish capital until 2022. "The first thing I want to do is apologise to people who misunderstood my statements," Griezmann said in a statement given to Atletico’s club website.
"Since I have arrived, I have given everything for my club, my colleagues and my coaching staff." Griezmann had claimed in May that there was a “six out of ten chance” he would be joining United this summer.
United will probably now turn more of its attention towards Alvaro Morata, with  reports claiming Andrea Belotti of Torino is now a target for Paris Saint-Germain.
Arsenal will have to pay a fee of £60 million if it wants to land  Alexandre Lacazette from Lyon. Lacazette, the prolific France striker, is Arsene Wenger’s main attacking target according to the  Daily Telegraph although Wenger would still like Kylian Mbappe, A.S Monaco’s prodigious teenager who is wanted by Real Madrid.


Alvaro Morata’s agent has revealed that Manchester United has made a “very important offer” for his client, according to reports.
Jose Mourinho gave United’s CEO Ed Woodward a list of players he wanted the club to sign this summer, with a striker likely to be high on the list after releasing Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
Real Madrid forward  Morata, 24, looks to be United’s main target after it lodged a bid that his agent, Juanma Lopez, said would leave Real with a decision to make, according to the  Daily Mail.
Lopez, the reports says, also confirmed that Italian giant AC Milan had also made attempts to sign the Spanish striker but the offer was “unsatisfactory.”
He said of United: “It’s a club with a lot of charm, a very interesting option.
“I can say that there’s a very important offer and the decision now rests with Real. I cannot tell [if an agreement is close], we’ll see.”

United confirmed its first major signing of the summer on Saturday when  Victor Lindelof joined for £31 million (about $39 million) from Benfica.
Morata would become the second major signing, likely to take United’s summer spending over £100 million with Real valuing him at £70 million (about $89 million).  
But Torino forward  Andrea Belotti, 23, is also reportedly among the strikers Mourinho has considered as Ibrahimovic’s replacement.


When Manchester United announced Saturday that it had agreed a deal for Swedish defender Victor Lindelof, the focus was on how he would benefit Jose Mourinho’s team.
An unsteady defense would be strengthened by  Lindelof’s arrival as the start of a summer spending spree to help  Mourinho’s team challenge for the Premier League title, as well as in Europe.
Alvaro Morata, of Real Madrid, is the striker expected to replace Zlatan Ibrahimovic in attack, costing around £60 million (about $76 million). Torino’s  Andrea Belotti is being considered, too, as part of the rebuild.
But on the other end of the deal for Lindelof was Benfica, the Portuguese club that has won the Primeira Liga for the past four seasons despite selling off many of its best players.
Lindelof, 22, is the latest product of the Benfica talent factory, but there were many before him. Here,  Newsweek  takes a look at some of those players:
David Luiz
Sold to Chelsea in 2011 for £22 million (about $28 million), Luiz went on to win the FA Cup, Champions League and Europa League, as well as the Premier League after returning to the club for a second stint last summer. He was criticized for his adventurous style of defending when he first arrived at Stamford Bridge but was praised for playing a key part in Antonio Conte’s title-winning team last campaign. Luiz, 30, also won two league titles with Paris Saint Germain, and has been named in the team of the year on four different occasions.
Angel Di Maria
After playing a key role in Benfica’s title victory in 2010, Real Madrid paid £22 million for Di Maria that summer. The left-footed forward won La Liga, two Copa del Rey titles and the Champions League in four years at the Bernabeu, becoming a favorite during Jose Mourinho’s time at the club. Di Maria’s stock rose and Manchester United paid £59 million (about $75 million) for him in 2014, but the Argentine stayed for just one season before joining Paris Saint Germain where he has won Ligue 1.

Bernardo Silva
Manchester City’s first signing of this summer, costing Pep Guardiola’s club £43.5 million (about $55 million), was developed through the Benfica academy. Silva, who like Di Maria is heavily left-footed, spent a year on loan at Monaco before joining the club permanently in January 2015. The 22-year-old Portuguese starred in Monaco’s team that reached the Champions League semifinal last season, before being plucked by Guardiola’s City.
Renato Sanches
Still only 19, Sanches was the last star product of the Benfica academy to leave when Bayern Munich paid £27.5 million (about $35 million) for the teenager last summer. Manchester United was also  reportedly interested in the midfielder’s services. He joined the Benfica academy in 2006, aged 9. He was named in the European Under-17 Championship team of the tournament in 2014 and, two years later, was named young player of the tournament at Euro 2016 in France, before his move to Bayern was confirmed.

The giant Serbian midfielder was at Chelsea at the age of 21 but failed to secure a place in the first team. The Premier League club opted to sell Matic to Benfica in part of a swap deal for Luiz in 2011 but would end up paying £21 million ($27 million) to bring him back three years later. He played a key role in Mourinho’s title-winning team in 2015, and in Conte’s last season.
Ramires
Another Benfica product to have been picked up by Chelsea, Ramires joined Benfica in 2009 at the age of 22 for £6.5 million (about $8.2 million) from Cruzeiro Esporte in his home country of Brazil. After just a year at the Estadio da Luz, Chelsea paid £20 million for the industrious midfielder. He spent six years at Stamford Bridge, where he won the Premier League, FA Cup, League Cup, Champions League and Europa League. His most memorable goal came in the semifinal of the Champions League in 2012 when he lobbed Victor Valdes, the Barcelona goalkeeper, to take Chelsea toward the final. In January, Chinese Super League club Jiangsu Suning bought him for £25 million.
Axel Witsel
Part of Benfica’s brilliance is setting a buyout clause for its players. When the Portuguese club signed Witsel in 2011, it set a £35 million clause on his contract for any potential buyers that was met by Zenit Saint Petersburg just a year later. After four years in the Russian Premier League, Witsel, like Ramires, moved to the Chinese Super League in January.
Andre Gomes
Gomes broke into the Benfica team in 2012 at the age of 18 having developed through the club’s academy. He helped the team to the Liga title in 2014 and joined Valencia the following year after a season on loan at the Mestalla. In Spain, the Portuguese midfielder impressed so much that Barcelona paid its La Liga rival £30 million. However, readers of  Marca, a Spanish newspaper, voted Gomes the worst signing of 2016-17.
Fabio Coentrao
After three loan spells away, Coentrao established himself in the Benfica first team in 2010. His impression on Europe saw Real Madrid sign the left-back for £26 million on a six-year deal. Coentrao has won two La Liga titles, two Champions Leagues and the Copa del Rey in his five years at the Bernabeu.


Dennis Rodman is in North Korea again to meet supreme leader Kim Jong Un and if his previous visits are anything to go by, the trip promises to be odd at the very least.
Rodman, the 56-year-old five-time  NBA champion, has been to North Korea on five previous occasions but not since January 2014.
"My purpose is to actually see if I can keep bringing sports to North Korea, so that's the main thing," Rodman said on Tuesday in quotes reported by the  BBC.
Here’s how those previous trips played out.
Visit One: March 2013
Rodman’s first visit to North Korea set a terrifically zany precedent. A tour of the country with the Harlem Globetrotters included a basketball exhibition in Pyongyang during which Rodman called Kim a “friend for life.” The game, also featuring North Korean players, ended 110-all before Kim was presented with a Globetrotters jersey. The full, out-of-body experience is now available to watch on YouTube.

Visit Two: September 2013
Rodman returned to North Korea sponsored by Paddy Power, the Irish betting company. “I’ve come out here to see my friend [Kim],” he said at the time in quotes reported by the  New York Times. “I want to talk about basketball.” Rodman had tweeted in May 2013 that he wanted Kim to “cut Kenneth Bae loose,” referring to the South Korean-born U.S. citizen imprisoned with 15 years’ hard labor at the time. Bae, returned home in November 2014, later thanked Rodman as the “catalyst” for his release. “He has to do his job,” Rodman said of Kim in a press conference defending his visit. “He’s a very good guy.”

Visit Three: December 2013
Rodman returned to North Korea for the third time in the space of a year. His visit, to hold trials for a basketball exhibition game on Kim’s birthday, came days after the execution of the supreme leader’s uncle Jang Song-thaek. Amid criticism, Paddy Power  withdrew its sponsorship of Rodman’s trips.
Visit Four: January 2014
Before the game between a team of retired American basketball professionals and North Koreans, Rodman huskily sang Happy Birthday to Kim. Later on the trip he was forced to apologize for a rant on CNN in which he appeared to suggest that Bae deserved his imprisonment.



Arsenal will block Alexis Sanchez from moving to a Premier League rival this summer, with Chelsea and Manchester City both keen suitors, according to reports.
Sanchez, who grew increasingly frustrated in  Arsene Wenger’s team last year, is reportedly wanting a move away from the Emirates Stadium.
A reunion with Pep Guardiola at Manchester City is one possibility as is joining the Premier League champion Chelsea, but  Arsenal is looking to learn from its mistakes, according to the  Daily Mail.
Sanchez’s representatives, the reports says, have looked into a possible move to the Etihad Stadium or across London to Stamford Bridge.
But  Arsenal will not allow Sanchez to join a  domestic rival, fearing that the sale could come back to haunt them by propelling another club to the title.
Related:   Is Arsenal Already Straggling Behind its Premier League Title Rivals?
This was the case in 2012 when Arsenal sold Robin van Persie to Manchester United, and the Dutchman scored 30 goals in his first season to help Sir Alex Ferguson’s team become Premier League champion.
“It’s never great to lose players of that quality but he only had a year contract so we do not have a choice,” Wenger said at the time to French TV, as quoted by the  BBC. Sanchez, incidentally, has one year left on his contract at Arsenal.
That leaves the 28-year-old Chilean forward with only one likely option. Bayern Munich, the German Bundesliga champion, is believed to be in the market for Sanchez, and Arsenal would be more willing to sell to an indirect rival.
Juventus, the Italian champion, is another possibility, with a valuation of around £45 million put on the forward.


LeBron James threw everything he had, and then a little bit more, at the Golden State Warriors in Game Five of the 2017 NBA Finals.
Turns out 41 points, 13 rebounds and eight assists won’t get you past a  potential dynasty.
James was dominant as he had been all series against the Warriors at Oracle Arena on Monday. But Stephen Curry was good and Kevin Durant was great, and for the fourth time in the series the Warriors found enough offense to beat the Cleveland Cavaliers.
James led the Cavaliers in points per game through the Finals, his 31.8 second only to Durant’s 34.3 among both teams. With Durant performing at MVP level, the Warriors could afford an average series from shooting guard Klay Thompson as they took home a second championship in three years from three consecutive Finals against the Cavaliers.
Watch James’ highlights from the Cavaliers’ 129-120 defeat below.



Steph Curry celebrated winning the NBA championship for the second time in three years in some style. The Warriors point guard swapped the traditional champagne dousing for a cigar — and he smoked it on live TV during his postgame interview.
Curry had 34 points and 10 assists in contributing to the Golden State Warriors victory to wrap up the NBA Final series in Game 5, with a 129-120 win over the  Cleveland Cavaliers.
Golden State became the first team to score at least 100 points in every game of the playoffs, and Curry was clearly delighted when he joined  NBA TV for his postgame chat with a cigar.
Curry, 29, explained that this was no regular smoke; this had been a year in the making. “The backstory to this is, after Game 7 last year, I told one of my close friends to save this for a year from now,” Curry said.
In last year’s NBA Finals, the Warriors took a 3-1 lead heading into Game 5, the same as it had this year, but Curry’s team didn’t manage to wrap up the series. LeBron James’ Cavaliers turned the series on its head, winning the last three games to take the title 4-3.
“To be able to enjoy the process and journey,” Curry added. “I’ve been waiting a whole year to smoke this, so I’m going to enjoy every last bit of this.”
Take a look as Curry lights up:



This piece has been updated to correct LeBron James' scoring statistics from Game Five.
Kevin Durant hugged his mom in the moments after victory in Game Five of the NBA Finals brought him his first championship.
But first,  Durant embraced another special someone too.
LeBron James, whose 41 points and triple-double average through the series could not hold off the Golden State Warriors’ multiple offensive juggernauts, was there to greet Durant with a hand slap, a hug and a pat on the head.

Durant has attracted ire for his decision to join the Warriors, who won 73 games last year but lost a 3-1 lead in the 2016 Finals to James’ Cleveland Cavaliers.
This time, James and Cavaliers point guard Kyrie Irving dragged the team to one dominant victory, in Game Four, while they blew an 11-point lead in Game Three. With the addition of Durant, the Warriors found enough ammunition to hold off James.
On Monday night at Oracle Arena, Durant had 39 points—the difference-maker in the Finals as teammate Draymond Green had predicted—and walked off as Finals MVP.
James—at his lowest ebb—was there to greet him, magnanimously.
Correction: This piece originally stated James achieved a triple-double in Game Five. He averaged a triple-double through the series.


Former NBA star Dennis Rodman said on Tuesday he was about to visit North Korea as a private citizen.
Rodman met North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on previous trips to Pyongyang.
He was expected to arrive in North Korea later on Tuesday for a trip that the State Department said was not an official U.S. visit, CNN reported on Monday.
In a tweet posted on Tuesday morning, Rodman confirmed what will be his fourth visit to the secretive east Asian state, saying he "will discuss when I return."
 
Headed back to North Korea. Thank you https://t.co/zBtIFz1QBr for sponsoring my mission. I&#39;ll discuss when I return. https://t.co/oCEsSvI90B

 
The Washington Post, meanwhile, noted that Rodman's visit to Kim, a basketball fan, comes at the same time as U.S. President Donald Trump is reportedly attempting to establish "back channels" of communication to the supreme leader.
Four U.S. citizens are currently being held by North Korea, including Otto Warmbier, a student at the University of Virginia given 15 years in prison with hard labor for the attempted theft of a propaganda poster in January 2016.


The Golden State Warriors beat the Cleveland Cavaliers 129-120 on Monday to win their second NBA championship in three seasons and cap a near-perfect run through the playoffs.
The Warriors, who beat Cleveland in the 2015 Finals only to lose to them last year after squandering a 3-1 series lead, went a record-setting 15-1 in the playoffs, their only loss coming in Game Four of the best-of-seven championship.
The win spelled redemption for the Warriors, who brought forward Kevin Durant over from the Oklahoma City Thunder last offseason to bolster their already high-powered offence.
Durant, who lost in his only previous Finals appearance, led the way for the Warriors with 39 points and was relieved after feeling pressure to deliver prior to the game.
"I couldn't sleep for two days," Durant, who was named the Finals MVP, said during an on-court interview. "I was anxious, I was jittery.
"I just wanted to lay it all out there. I put in work, I just had to trust in it. We were really good tonight."
Durant tipped his hat to Cleveland, especially guard Kyrie Irving and forward LeBron James.
"You have to tip your hat to Cleveland," he said.
"LeBron and Kyrie I've never seen nothing like them two before. But we prevailed, we're champions and it's amazing doing it on our home floor."
James had a game-high 41 points and Irving hit tough shots all night but defensive breakdowns by Cleveland led to easy baskets late in the game for the Warriors, igniting a deafening crowd.
"We learned from everything we've been through," Warriors point guard Stephen Curry said during the trophy celebration. "Our perspective, being blessed to play on this stage three years in a row.
"To be back here and bring gold Larry (O'Brien) back home, I'm just excited to be a part of this group and accomplish something special. I'm ready to do it again."
An unprecedented third straight Finals clash between the Warriors and Cavaliers was hyped as the ultimate championship rubber match and expected to be the antidote for a postseason that had little in the way of drama.
But that idea fizzled fast when the Warriors opened with a pair of lopsided wins at home, fought back late to steal the next game in Cleveland and then, after dropping their first game of the postseason, closed out the series at home.
In the end, the Cavaliers simply did not have the requisite star power to topple the talent-laden Warriors, even with four-time league MVP James doing all he could to keep his team in it.
For James, already a three-times champion, the loss puts him in rare - but not ideal - company as only the fourth player to come up short in five NBA Finals.
Cleveland's inability to give the Warriors much of a fight has already sparked talk that James, who left the team in 2010 for Miami before returning four years later, could consider another move during 2018 free agency.


Manchester United is closing on its second signing of the 2017 summer transfer window, according to reports.
Having agreed a deal for Benfica’s Victor Lindelof to partner  Eric Bailly in the center of defense,  Jose Mourinho has turned his attention to adding steel and energy to his midfield as he seeks the balance that would allow Paul Pogba to roam.
His target?  Fabinho, the A.S. Monaco central midfielder who was so impressive last season during the French club’s run to the Champions League semifinals.
According to  The Independent, “progress” has been made towards a deal for the 23-year-old who can also play at right back, where he could cover for Antonio Valencia.
After a season in which it crashed out of the Champions League, humiliatingly, to Barcelona and surrendered the Ligue 1 title to Monaco, Paris Saint-Germain is determined to “send a strong signal” to the rest of Europe, according to  L’Equipe.
That could be bad news for Premier League clubs because P.S.G. apparently has its sights set on another Monaco player, teenager  Kylian Mbappe.
Mbappe, 18, made a name for himself last season with a series of startling performances in Monaco’s Champions League campaign. He was reported to be an Arsenal target but  L’Equipe  says P.S.G.’s chairman Nasser al-Khelaifi has established contact with Mbappe’s representatives over a summer deal through Antero Henrique, the Parisians’ new sports director.
Chelsea,  meanwhile, has watched rivals United and Manchester City make early progress in the transfer market and may now be prepared to move. According to  AS , the Spanish newspaper, manager Antonio Conte wants Real Madrid’s James Rodriguez as a replacement for Cesc Fabregas.
Conte wanted Alvaro Morata as a replacement for Diego Costa but Morata appears set for United and the Italian is said to be “confident” that he will not be outbid for Rodriguez as well.


Jose Mourinho has left Manchester United’s summer transfer dealings to CEO Ed Woodward, with a striker at the top of his list.
Alvaro Morata, of Real Madrid, is among the targets for  United along with Torino’s Andrea Belotti, who United has made a £70 million ($89 million) bid for, according to  The Independent.
Belotti, 23, is currently on international duty with Italy, and on Sunday night he scored the second goal of a 5-0 victory over Liechtenstein in group B of the 2018 World Cup qualifiers.
Belotti, who scored 28 goals in 37 goals for Torino last season, linked up with Napoli forward Lorenzo Insigne and finished coolly past Peter Jehle.
Take a look:



“Come to me, you will be important.”
Those are the words  Jose Mourinho used to convince Real Madrid striker  Alvaro Morata into a move to Old Trafford, according to a report in the Spanish press.
Marca, the Madrid-based newspaper, claims Morata, 24, has made up his mind on a transfer that will cost United somewhere between £62 million and £79 million.
For much of last season it seemed a foregone conclusion that Mourinho would take Antoine Griezmann from Atletico Madrid. But a serious injury to Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who is no longer at the club, left the Portuguese needing a “number nine” to hold the ball up as well as score goals.
Morata has emerged as the most likely signing to replace Ibrahimovic in part due to his dissatisfaction at Real.  Marca claims he is unhappy predominantly playing as a substitute. Mourinho has promised to make him feel loved and valued while Morata, who played at Juventus in Serie A for two seasons before returning to Santiago Bernabeu for the 2016-17 campaign, has heard good things about United from Spain teammates Ander Herrera and David De Gea.
Morata’s price may yet be a sticking point. The report claims United and Real are going to meet on Monday, though they remain a way apart on a valuation. United would like Morata for £62 million while Real wants £79 million, which would make the player the fourth most-expensive transfer of all time.
It seems likely the two clubs will meet somewhere in between though huge transfer fees pose little problem to United, as it proved last summer by sanctioning a world-record deal for Paul Pogba. If Morata has been so convinced by Mourinho, United may now hold the power in the deal, making it reasonable to expect to see Morata lining up in United red for the first game of the new Premier League season in August.


The United States Men’s National Team took a point out of the Azteca Stadium Sunday night against Mexico to remain on course for 2018 World Cup qualification.
The way it did so will live long in the memory.
Michael Bradley, the Toronto FC midfielder who spent many of his formative years in European football, conjured up something his former AS Roma teammate  Francesco Totti would have been proud of on six minutes. Intercepting a pass in the center of the field, one touch took Bradley clear of the Mexico defense. Then, spotting Mexico goalkeeper Guillermo Ochoa off his line, the 29-year-old carved a parabola over his head.
Carlos Vela equalized to deny Bruce Arena’s side three points and keep Mexico top of the North, Central American and Caribbean (CONCACAF) qualifying group.

FIFA president Gianni Infantino does not believe that the diplomatic crisis which has embroiled 2022 World Cup host nation Qatar will threaten its staging of the tournament, he said on Sunday.
The global soccer body also confirmed that it had replaced a Qatari refereeing team who were due to officiate at a World Cup qualifying match involving the United Arab Emirates on Tuesday.
In an interview published in Swiss newspapers Le Matin Dimanche and Sonntagszeitung, Infantino said he expected the diplomatic situation to be back to normal by the time the tournament is played in five-and-a-half years' time.
Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Bahrain cut links with Qatar last Monday, accusing Doha of supporting terrorism. Qatar says the allegations are based on lies.
Asked if he believed that Qatar's hosting was in danger, Infantino replied: "No. In any case, I am not in the habit of speculating and I'm not going to this time either."
Infantino said that FIFA was watching the situation and was in regular contact with the Qatari authorities.
"The essential role of FIFA, as I understand it, is to deal with football and not to interfere in geopolitics," he said.
"We are indeed facing a diplomatic crisis. But on the other hand, I am confident that the region will return to a normalized situation. The World Cup is in 2022. In five years. Obviously, if football can make a small contribution, in any way, to an improvement, I will not hesitate to offer my help."
FIFA confirmed in an emailed statement to Reuters that the UAE's match away to Thailand on Tuesday would no longer be refereed by Qatari officials.
"We can confirm that FIFA has replaced the match officials originally appointed for the... game," it said. "The decision has been taken for sporting reasons and in view of the current geopolitical situation."
FIFA added that it had changed the officials of its own accord and denied it had responded to a UAE request.
The UAE federation said on Twitter that the match referee would now be Muhammad Taqi from Singapore.


Claycourt master Rafael Nadal was too hot to handle as he crushed Swiss third seed Stan Wawrinka 6-2 6-3 6-1 to claim a record-extending 10th French Open title on Sunday.
The fourth seed, who has lost only two matches at Roland Garros since his debut in 2005, is now just one short of Margaret Court's all-time record of 11 titles at a single grand slam.
Nadal, who has now won 15 grand slam titles in total, was never troubled in a one-sided final.
He claimed the Musketeers Cup without dropping a set in the tournament for the third time, having lost only 35 games en route to achieving what has been dubbed 'La Decima'.
Wawrinka, who had won his three previous finals at a major, bowed out on the second match point when he sliced a backhand volley into the net.

2017—Reached the Australian Open final where he lost to Federer in five sets. The Spaniard won three titles on the Tour before entering Roland Garros.


Russian tennis star Maria Sharapova will not return to the Wimbledon tennis tournament in her first season since her controversial doping ban.
Sharapova has not played since pulling out from her second-round match at the Italian Open on May 16 with an injury. The tournament was part of an ambitious return schedule, following a 15-month ban from all competitions after testing positive for meldonium — a banned substance that increases exercise capacity in athletes. She faces a race against time to recover a high ranking and seeded entry into Grand Slam tournaments.
The return of the five time Grand Slam winner has prompted some negative backlash from fellow tennis players, particularly since she has been awarded wild card status in some tournaments including next week’s Aegon Classic in Birmingham as well as ranking tournaments in Stuttgart, Madrid and Rome. Those who argued for her participation said that, as a five-time champion, her return would drive up ticket sales, especially for the less prominent events on the tour.

The debate about whether the famous Russian should benefit from a career boost is a thorny one, with some of her competitors angered by treatment that they perceive as too lenient. Canadian ace Eugenie Bouchard claimed Sharapova should be banned  from the sport  for life  for the drugs ban. The pair’s showdown on the court in Madrid was then billed as a grudge match.
The French Open, Roland-Garros, denied her wildcard status because of the drugs ban, announcing its decision shortly before Sharapova pulled out of the Italian Open. Her performance in Italy meant she ranked high enough for entry into Wimbledon qualifiers starting June 26, but she needed to reach the semifinals in Rome to enter the Wimbledon main draw.
In a post on  Facebook, Sharapova confirmed her injury would keep her out of the entire grass season, missing the opportunity to recover her ranking from her current world position of 178.
“After an additional scan, the muscle tear that I sustained in Rome will unfortunately not allow me to compete in the grass court tournaments I was scheduled to play,” she wrote. “I want to thank the LTA (Lawn and Tennis Association) for their amazing support on my return and providing me with a Birmingham wild card, a tournament which I hope many of you will be able to attend.”
As a result, Sharapova will not be ranked highly enough for direct entry into the U.S. Open on August 28.  She has not played a Grand Slam since her ban.
Sharapova plans to return to action at the week-long tennis tournament in Stanford, California, in late July.


Arsene Wenger is facing the toughest summer of his 21 years as manager of Arsenal after failing to qualify for the Champions League for the first time in two decades.
Winning the FA Cup last month came as little consolation after finishing fifth in the  Premier League and missing out on Europe’s top club competition. That will make the prospect of joining  Arsenal less attractive, and, possibly, add to the price of potential signings.
This summer, the board has urged  Wenger to be more  assertive in the market after years of frustrating transfer windows for the club. But the Frenchman also faces three months of holding off the interest of other clubs in his key players. Here,  Newsweek  looks at the business Wenger will have to consider this summer, both for incomings and outgoings:
Don’t Go  —  Again!
For years, much of the criticism pointed at Wenger has been regarding his failure to hold onto players. Robin van Persie, most notably, left Arsenal in 2012 to join Manchester United, where he won the Premier League title as top scorer. There are fears this summer than Alexis Sanchez could be the Van Persie of 2017, with Manchester City, Chelsea and, even, Manchester United circling for the disgruntled forward. Abroad, Bayern Munich is reported to be offering Sanchez a lucrative deal and, of course, Champions League football. Convincing Sanchez to stay may be the hardest task of the summer for Wenger.
Another headache for Wenger is  Barcelona’s interest in Hector Bellerin, the 22-year-old Spanish defender. Bellerin was developed through the La Masia academy but left to join Arsenal in 2011 at the age of 16 where he stayed and excelled. With Barca reportedly offering more than £40 million for the right back, Arsenal has to decide whether to cash-in once again.
Steel in Defense
The joke circling Wembley Stadium on the afternoon of the FA Cup final, when Arsenal beat Chelsea to lift its only silverware of the season, concerned the man of the match. Per Mertesacker, the club captain, had been named in the Arsenal team for the first time that season after recovering from injury, and his stellar performance drew some to call for him to be named Player of the Year at the Emirates Stadium.
Such praise also cast disdain on the rest of Arsenal’s team, and defense. Laurent Koscielny has been the mainstay at the heart of the backline, the skillful Frenchman capable of launching attacks and preventing them, but lacking in consistency. The man meant to strengthen the defense was Shkodran Mustafi who signed from Valencia for £35 million on the final day of the transfer window last summer. Mustafi, a German international, has struggled to get up to speed with the pace and intensity of English football. So, will Wenger look to shore up his defense once again? He has already added left-back Sead Kolasinac to the squad and has been urged by former Gunner  Sol Campbell to sign Virgil van Dijk from Southampton.
Goalscoring Galactico
Arsenal has relied heavily on Alexis Sanchez’s goals—30 last season—to win games, but may not be able to do so next year. The next highest scorer was Olivier Giroud with 16 in 40 matches. With the club in danger of losing Sanchez, it will desperately need a forward capable of scoring at least 20 goals a season. Reports have suggested Wenger has travelled to France to try and bring Kylian Mbappe, the Monaco forward and Europe’s most exciting prospect, to north London. Mbappe is still only 18 years old but starred in a Monaco team that reached the semifinal of the Champions League, scoring 24 goals in 41 matches for the Ligue 1 side. The problem, of course, is that Monaco is said to want a world-record sum to sell Mbappe. Another issue for Arsenal is that Real Madrid, with all its financial might, is keen on signing the forward. And, worse still, Mbappe is even believed to want to remain in the south of France for at least one more season.
Wenger, instead, has looked at another of France’s prolific attackers, and one in his prime. Alexandre Lacazette, the Lyon striker, has been linked with a move to Arsenal for the past two summers, but a deal was never agreed. Lyon is likely to demand around £50 million for the 26-year-old but if Lacazette can take the goalscoring form that saw him score 36 in 44 games last season, it would be money well spent for Wenger and Arsenal.


Jose Mourinho has described himself as “fed up” and “tired of football” after an exhausting first season at Manchester United that left him needing a break.
This, the Portuguese coach said, would mean the burden of transfer business at Old Trafford would be  left to United CEO Ed Woodward while he took a step back.  Mourinho added that he had given a list of players he wants to Woodward.
United’s three trophies last season included the Europa League, which qualified United for next season’s Champions League, in turn making the Premier League club a much more attractive destination for prospective players. Here,  Newsweek  looks at the areas that  Mourinho —or, rather, Woodward—will have to address this summer:
Dealing With Rooney
When Wayne Rooney came on for Juan Mata in the 89th minute of the Europa League final last month, the move was seen as a sentimental gesture from Mourinho; a way of allowing him to say goodbye and leave on a high. Rooney had been linked with a lucrative move to the Chinese Super League, but reports suggest he wouldn’t be keen on the move. The MLS in the U.S. is an option, too. Rooney, however, is said to want to make a return to Everton, the club he left for United in 2003, aged 16, and the club he grew up supporting. More sentimentality; but that all ends as reports suggest Everton would not be able to afford his wages and the  Daily Mail says he would be willing to sit on his contract at Old Trafford until it expires next summer. That wouldn’t suit United, nor Mourinho.
Replacing Ibrahimovic
“Thank you and goodbye” seems to be the message from United to Zlatan Ibrahimovic. At the age of 35, Ibrahimovic has come to the end of his one-year contract at United having scored 28 goals in 46 appearances, with crucial goals that helped Mourinho’s team to three trophies. But a cruciate ligament injury sidelined the Swede before the end of the season, and the  BBC says United will not offer him a contract extension.
This leaves Mourinho in need of a striker. Everton’s Romelu Lukaku was believed to be a target but the Belgian reportedly prefers a return to Chelsea, so now Alvaro Morata, the Real Madrid forward, is believed to be United’s top target, according to  The Guardian. The pace and aerial threat Morata possesses would fit as a replacement for Ibrahimovic, and the 24-year-old has also shown his prolific ability having scored just under a goal every other game last season with 22 in 47. Andrea Belotti, of Torino, is also said to be an option but the Italian club is demanding £70 million for him. United is in a compromised position; it needs a striker and everyone knows it, so inflated valuations will be charged.

Settling The Defense
That Daley Blind played a large chunk of games at center back for United last season shows the faith Mourinho had in his defenders. Injuries ravaged Chris Smalling’s season but the United manager has criticized the English defender, and doesn’t appear to have great faith in him. The expectation is that a center back would be high on that scribbled list Mourinho handed to Woodward. In January, Benfica’s Victor Lindelof was sought after but the deal didn’t make it over the line. This summer, the 22-year-old Swede could be one of United’s first confirmed transfers, as reported by  The Independent.
Adding Experience to Midfield
Manchester United has one year of 35-year-old Michael Carrick left. The club said goodbye to Bastian Schweinsteiger earlier this year. Morgan Schneiderlin, too. The midfield at Old Trafford is lacking experience, with pressure mounting even greater on the shoulders of the world’s most expensive midfielder Paul Pogba. The highly sought after Belgian Radja Nainggolan, 29, is one of the possible targets for the club. Tiemoue Bakayoko, of Monaco, is another midfielder linked with a move to Old Trafford, but for all his quality, the Frenchman is still only 22 and lacks the experience Mourinho likes—and needs. 


And they’re off. The transfer window slides open today with the English football's wealthiest clubs deciding how to spend their money.
Jose Mourinho’s Manchester United is set to make a £60 million bid as he looks to bring in a big-name, prolific striker.  Chelsea, meanwhile, is looking to do the opposite after news of Diego Costa’s rift with  Antonio Conte on Thursday.
Arsene Wenger has been urged to be more assertive in the transfer market this summer, but reports today suggest that the  Arsenal manager is trying to hold onto players rather than sign them. Here,  Newsweek  takes you through all the news and rumors in the Premier League’s transfer market:
One of the certainties at Old Trafford this summer seemed to be that captain  Wayne Rooney would be heading for the exit. Everton was a possible destination, as was going to China or the MLS in the United States. But, according to the  Daily Mail, Rooney is considering remaining at Manchester United and seeing out his £250,000-a-week deal that has one year to run.
Zlatan Ibrahimovic is unlikely to be at the club next season, though, as the  BBC say United is not going to offer the 35-year-old striker a new contract. His replacement could be Real Madrid’s  Alvaro Morata, and United are set to make an improved bid of £60 million for the 24-year-old, according to  The Guardian.

News that Antonio Conte wants to get rid of Chelsea striker  Diego Costa has seen various rumors about his next move. The  Daily Mirror says the Spanish striker is in talks over a £40 million move to AC Milan, but  The Sun claims Costa has begged Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich to help him stay at Stamford Bridge.
Chelsea is among the suitors, who also include Manchester City, for Southampton’s  Virgil van Dijk after Liverpool ended its interest in the defender. According to the  Daily Mail, Southampton will not let him leave for less than £70 million.
In north London, Arsenal is confident that Spanish right-back  Hector Bellerin will remain at the Emirates Stadium this summer, according to the  London Evening Standard, despite strong interest from Barcelona. The  paper also says Brighton, Newcastle, Watford and Stoke are keen on signing Gunners’ left-back Kieran Gibbs.
Arsenal is, however, preparing for  Alexis Sanchez to leave. The  Daily Mirror says Bayern Munich will offer the 28-year-old striker £350,000-a-week to take him to the Allianz Arena.
Jurgen Klopp has been keen on signing former Chelsea winger  Mohamed Salah but, according to the  Liverpool Echo, Roma’s valuation of £35 million is pricing  Liverpool out of the market.


The Saudi Arabian Football Federation has apologized after its national team did not properly observe a minute's silence for the victims of the London attacks before the start of a World Cup qualifier in Australia.
The Australia team lined up in the centre circle ahead of the match at Adelaide Oval late on Thursday but all bar one of the Saudi players, although silent, dispersed around the pitch and continued to jog and stretch.
Eight people were killed and 50 injured after three Islamist militants drove into pedestrians on London Bridge last Saturday, then attacked revellers nearby with knives. Two of the dead were Australian.
Football Federation Australia (FFA) said it had "sought agreement" from the Saudis and regional governing body, the Asian Football Confederation (AFC), to hold the minute's silence. 
"Both the AFC and the Saudi team agreed that the minute of silence could be held," a spokesman said. 
"The FFA was further advised by Saudi team officials that this tradition was not in keeping with Saudi culture and they would move to their side of the field and respect our custom whilst taking their own positions on the field."
The governing body of Saudi football later issued a statement saying it "deeply" regretted and "unreservedly" apologised for their players not "formally" observing the minute's silence.
"The players did not intend any disrespect to the memories of the victims or to cause upset to their families, friends or any individual affected by the atrocity," it added.
"The Saudi Arabian Football Federation condemns all acts of terrorism and extremism and extends its sincerest condolences to the families of all the victims and to the government and people of the United Kingdom."
The AFC said it had monitored the incident, as well as "various statements", but that any disciplinary action against the Saudis would have to come from world governing body FIFA, who have jurisdiction over all World Cup qualifiers. 
The incident prompted a social media storm and comes at a time when Australians are still mourning victims of recent attacks.
In addition to the Australians who died in London, a deadly siege in Melbourne on Tuesday that Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull called "an act of terrorism" claimed one victim, while an Australian schoolgirl was one of more than a dozen killed in a Baghdad car bomb blast last week. 
Turnbull said on Friday that he had not seen video of the incident at the Adelaide Oval but thought everybody should condemn "terrorism".
"The whole world, the whole free world, is united in condemnation of that terrorist attack and terrorism generally," he told reporters in Tasmania.
"The heartbreaking, heartbreaking loss of young Australians in London, of course in Baghdad, and just this week in Melbourne to these murderous terrorists - everybody, everyone should be united in condemnation of the terrorists and love and sympathy and respect for the victims and their families."
Australia won the match 3-2 to move level on 16 points in Group B with the second-placed Saudis and leaders Japan, who have a game in hand, with two rounds to play.
The top two teams win a place at the World Cup finals in Russia next year.


On May 25, 1969, Midnight Cowboy was released with an X rating (it would win Best Picture the following year), the Sudanese government was overthrown in a military coup d’état and Jon Sutherland did not go for a run.
Hundreds of millions of men and women eschew running each day, but Sutherland’s day off has become newsworthy. It is now more than 48 years later, and that date marked the last time the Earth made one full rotation without the long and lean loper dashing at least one mile. "On May 25, 1969 I got off crutches after a very painful bout of shin splints," says Sutherland. "I was cleared to run on May 26th that began the journey."
When the 66-year-old Southern Californian downs his customary swig of Dr. Pepper (“I’ve never drank coffee in my life,” Sutherland says) before his early morning run on Thursday, it will mark the 17,546th consecutive day that he has gone running. He has run every day and has even, in December of 1971, run every hour of one day. "I did it with nine college teammates," says Sutherland, who attended Los Angeles Valley College for two years (where he also threw a no-hitter) and later Cal-State Northridge. "I ran 29 miles in a 24-hour period, averaging right around five-minute miles."
Sutherland’s is the longest known run of running still running. Three-time British Olympian Ron Hill, who won the 1970 Boston Marathon, ended his streak of more than 52 years last January due to heart problems. Sutherland established the United States consecutive-days record a little more than three years ago, when he eclipsed the mark of 45 years set by his former Los Angeles Valley College cross-country teammate Mark Covert. “It was Mark who inspired me to begin this,” says Sutherland, the cross-country coach at Chaminade Prep in West Hills, California. “I always looked up to him—and at his back during races—and he told me in 1969 that he had run every day for a year. So I thought, Why not?”

Wednesday marked the second annual Global Running Day, in which millions of people from both hemispheres renewed their pledges to running. Sutherland, who went for runs in the morning and afternoon at El Escorpion Park, not far from his home, was blissfully unaware that such a day existed. “Is it?” he said. “I had no idea.”
The 6-foot-4-inch, 158-pound harrier has long been fueled by the twin passions of running and rock ’n’ roll. (His email address begins “jonrunrock@.”) A music journalist for three decades, Sutherland recalls watching Jimi Hendrix tune his guitar before a show across the street from his alma mater Granada Hills High School in 1969. Like a scene out of Almost Famous, the teenage Sutherland approached the guitar god and asked, “What’s happening?” Hendrix replied matter-of-factly, “Me!”
Running has long set Sutherland apart from most of the human race, and for that he has zero regrets. During his final two undergrad years at Cal-State Northridge, where Sutherland was a philosophy major, he wrote a paper titled “Is It Okay to Dedicate Your Life to Running If You’re Not Any Good?” The irony is that the former sub-4-minute-10-second miler, sub-2-minute-25-second marathoner and sub-29-minute 10K racer is very, very good.
Sutherland has taken part in more than 600 races of varying distances and won approximately half of them. In the 1970s, he led Boston Marathon legend Bill Rodgers in a 10K for most of the race before Rodgers beat him by two steps, turning backward as he broke the tape and asking, “Who are you?”
Sutherland alternates between fond memories of running and rock with the ease of an inveterate runner transitioning between trails and roads. And he is hyperaware that this streak has taken him from Running on Empty (Jackson Browne) to The Long Run (Eagles) through Running With the Devil (Van Halen), all of which were penned by fellow Los Angelenos.

In one moment he will talk about premeet training runs with the legendary Steve Prefontaine and New Zealand’s Rod Dixon (the 1,500-meter bronze medalist at the 1972 Olympics), a lifelong friend. In the next, and with no less enthusiasm, Sutherland will share how he helped Metallica find a new bassist. “I was talking to Lars [Ulrich] and they were looking for someone,” says Sutherland. “I was known as the guy who knew all of the L.A. musicians, and I suggested Jason Newsted. He stuck with them for 15 years.”
After Newsted played a few dates with Metallica in 1986, Sutherland stopped by a show to see how the new guy was working out. “I walked through a door,” he says, “and the guys spotted me and dogpiled me.”

Sutherland’s running stretch has never been tested by familial obligations (he is a lifelong bachelor and has no children), but there have been physical tribulations: He has broken 10 bones and undergone two arthroscopic knee surgeries. “The trick is to have the surgery early in the morning,” he says, “and then bribe the doc into giving you time-release painkillers.”

During a half-marathon run on Ventura Boulevard, Sutherland slipped on a patch of ice and, like the character in the Tom Petty song that references the street, found himself free-falling. He suffered a hip avulsion—part of his pelvic bone literally broke off—but he still kept running. “I was in pain for nine months after that,” says Sutherland, “but I never stopped.”
He has squeezed in 11:30 p.m. runs in order to maintain the continuity. He has yet to be derailed by weather, although he vividly remembers an ice storm in Atlanta where "trees and telephone poles were falling due to the weight of the ice." Late nights covering bands never stopped him (“I won a 10K the morning after a David Bowie concert”) nor has Southern California’s notorious traffic. “I always carry a running kit in my car,” says Sutherland, a “head-to-toe” Nike guy, “so that if I have to pull over, park and get in a run, I will.”
Sutherland has dozens and dozens of meticulously kept running journals in his home dating back decades.   COURTESY JON SUTHERLAND   
He knows what you’re wondering. “My dad used to ask, ‘Why do you do it?’ ” Sutherland says. “I had a local CBS station follow me around for four days, and they talked to a psychologist and tried to prove I was crazy. It’s as simple as this: I always wanted to have fun. Memories over money. How many people can say they’ve run with Steve Prefontaine and been dogpiled by Metallica?”
Few. So he continues to run. Thursday is day number 17,546 and Friday, after a swig of Dr. Pepper, is day number 17,547. For decades, he has had a runner drafting off him: Jim Pearson of Marysville, Washington, whose own streak began on February 16, 1970. Pearson is 246 days behind Sutherland, but he is also 73, and Sutherland shows no signs of relinquishing the lead. “What will get me to stop?” he asks. “Death, I guess. I love to run, and this is who I am. It’s not negotiable.”


After the final game of the Premier League season, Jurgen Klopp said his team had “pretty much done” its work after qualifying for the Champions League.
Liverpool finished fourth in the table and will enter the European competition’s qualifying stages in August, a position that makes the club far more attractive to players. Officially, the  transfer window opens on Friday, but  Liverpool has already made headlines for its attempts to sign Southampton center back Virgil van Dijk.
Here,  Newsweek  looks at the areas that  Klopp needs to address this summer as he prepares for his third season at Anfield.
Lots of goals
Everybody wants one, but Liverpool needs one. Liverpool’s top scorers in the league last season were Philippe Coutinho and Sadio Mane, with 13 goals each—that’s less than half the total of Tottenham’s Harry Kane, who won the Golden Boot with 29 goals.
Klopp’s team is based on the strategy of every player flooding forward with such pace and fluidity is capable of scoring. But, as seen throughout last season, this style came unstuck whenever a team sat behind the ball and defended. The six defeats Liverpool endured in the league came against Burnley, Bournemouth, Swansea, Hull City, Leicester and Crystal Palace, teams it was expected to beat. Klopp needs a 20-goals-a-season striker, but that is going to cost him.
A reliable goalkeeper
After signing Loris Karius from Mainz last summer, Klopp looked to bring him into the team as his first-choice goalkeeper, ahead of Simon Mignolet. In the end, it caused him a headache. Karius’s mistakes drew criticism from players and pundits, notably the former Manchester United players Gary and Phil Neville, comments Klopp got particularly annoyed about.
The German flipped back to Mignolet as his number one in December, and Karius was between the posts for the cup competitions. Clearly, Klopp doesn’t have complete faith in either goalkeeper. The suggestion is that he may capitalize on Joe Hart’s inevitable exit from Manchester City.

Daniel Sturridge: stay or go?
The England striker could be the answer to Klopp’s problems in attack. In 2014, when Liverpool finished second in the Premier League under Brendan Rodgers, Sturridge scored 28 goals in 42 appearances for club and country. He is capable, but doesn’t seem to fit into Klopp’s style. He is also a big injury risk, having sat out significant amount of the past two seasons with illness and injury. If Klopp doesn’t want him, Liverpool should cash-in on the 27-year-old forward to create funds for a striker who does fit in and will score the goals the team needs.
A capable center-back
Virgil van Dijk was meant to be that man. The Dutchman had chosen Liverpool, the club said it was willing to pay £60 million for him, but then it all came crashing down on Wednesday when Liverpool abruptly ended its interest and apologized to Southampton, Van Dijk’s club, for its approach. So Klopp is still on the lookout. Michael Keane, of Burnley, is one of the most sought-after center-backs after proving to be resolute in defense and creative outside it. Middlesbrough’s Ben Gibson fits into that category, too.


The Golden State Warriors are now just one game away from the perfect postseason after taking a 3-0 lead over Cleveland Cavaliers in the NBA Finals on Wednesday night.
Win on Friday and  the Warriors will become the first team in history to win 16 out of 16 in the postseason. The Cavaliers gave it everything on Wednesday but were stunned by the Warriors scoring the game’s final 11 points in the last three minutes to turn the score on its head. The game ended 118-113 to the Warriors.
LeBron James, once again, starred for the Cavaliers, hitting 39 points, 11 rebounds and nine assists. But James and the Cavaliers’ whole series was summed up in just one play, posted to Twitter by Bleacher Report, where  Stephen Curry snatches the ball from James as he goes for the hoop.

Kellogg Co faced off with Australian tennis player Thanasi Kokkinakis in court on Thursday, with the cereal giant accusing the sportsman nicknamed "Special K" of using its intellectual property for commercial purposes.
The United States-listed firm wants to stop the 21-year-old from using its trademarked product name as a moniker in advertisements for tennis clothing, a spokeswoman told Reuters.
The matter had its first hearing in Federal Court of the city of Adelaide, Kokkinakis's hometown, on Thursday, according to court filings.
Kellogg's lawyer declined to comment, while Kokkinakis's lawyer did not respond to two calls requesting comment.
The tennis player's official Twitter account on Thursday published a crying laughter image with no words.

Kellogg, which dominates the Australian cereal market, promotes Special K as a healthy, low-fat, low-sugar breakfast, often featuring physical activity in its advertisements.
"His association (with the brand) could help, but at the end of the day it's a trademark that we own and we want to continue to own," said the Kellogg spokeswoman, referring to Kokkinakis.
The Davis Cup player reached his highest world ranking of 69 as a teenager in 2015 before a series of injuries sidelined him for the best part of 18 months. He made his singles return in Bordeaux last month.


Less than 24 hours until the transfer window slides open and the Premier League’s top teams are being linked with spending big this summer.
Manchester United paid a world-record sum to sign Paul Pogba last summer, and it may have to do so again during this window as Jose Mourinho seeks a new striker. His former club  Chelsea is also in the market for a new forward, as well as Antonio Conte considering a swap deal to strengthen his defense.
Arsene Wenger looks to have been hit with a blow in his pursuit of one of Europe’s finest young talents, while  Tottenham seeks a defender to join its already solid backline. Here,  Newsweek  guides you through the news and rumors on Thursday morning:
Jose Mourinho’s hunt for a striker has seen him linked with Europe’s finest. Manchester United has had a £52.4 million bid for Real Madrid’s  Alvaro Morata turned down, according to  Sky Sports.
Mourinho’s other option has been Torino’s 23-year-old striker  Andrea Belotti, the Italian who scored 28 goals in Serie A last season. But the  Manchester Evening News says United will have to meet Belotti’s £87 million release clause if it wants to bring him to Old Trafford.
Antonio Conte is looking to strengthen his Chelsea squad ahead of the new season, and his pursuit of center back  Leonardo Bonucci has been widely reported. This morning,  The Sun says Chelsea is willing to offer £48 million for the Italian plus midfielder  Nemanja Matic.
After reports yesterday that  Romelu Lukaku had told his agent, Mino Raiola, that he wanted to join Chelsea, the  London Evening Standard says the west London club will pay £80 million for  the Belgian striker and pay him more than £150,000-a-week.
Lukaku looks set to replace  Diego Costa as the club’s main striker after the Spaniard told reporters that Conte told him he was no longer needed at Chelsea and would need to find a new club, as quoted by the  BBC.
In north London, Arsene Wenger has been reportedly chasing the signature of Monaco wonderboy  Kylian Mbappe, 18. Arsenal is also facing competition from the might of Real Madrid, with some suggestions saying the young forward would cost a world-record sum. But, according to  Le Parisien, Mbappe will reject any move away from Monaco and sign a new contract.
Real Madrid has also ended its interest in Manchester United goalkeeper  David de Gea, according to  Marca, and will stick with Keylor Navas and Kiko Casilla instead.
Mauricio Pochettino will spend the summer trying to hold onto Tottenham’s best players, but he is also aiming to strengthen the team that finished runner-up in the Premier League last season. Borussia Dortmund defender  Matthias Ginter, 23, is on his list of targets,  The Independent says, and he would cost around £15 million.
Southampton defender  Virgil van Dijk is back up for grabs after Liverpool, which was set to pay £60 million for the Dutchman,  released a statement apologizing to the south coast club and ending its interest in him.


The Golden State Warriors beat the Cleveland Cavaliers 118-113 on Wednesday to take a 3-0 stranglehold on the NBA Finals and move to within one game of an unprecedented perfect run through the playoffs.
Kevin Durant scored a team-high 31 points for the Warriors, who improved to 15-0 in the postseason and will get a chance on Friday in Cleveland to become the first team to go unbeaten all the way to a title.
Cleveland had looked like they might prevail when they led by six points with three minutes to play but Durant led the Warriors on an impressive 11-0 run to close out the game.
Durant's pull-up three-pointer over LeBron James with 45 seconds remaining gave the Warriors their first lead since late in the third quarter and silenced what had been a raucous crowd.
"All I was looking at was the bottom of the net," said Durant, a four-times scoring champion playing his first season with Golden State. "I've been working on that shot my whole life."
James led the way for Cleveland with 39 points while Kyrie Irving added 38 in an electrifying performance.
The NBA's best-of-seven championship was billed as the ultimate grudge match between the league's last two champions and some pundits felt it could go down as one of the most hotly-contested series of all-time.
But the top-seeded Warriors are playing at another level and barring a meltdown of epic proportions, will soon be celebrating their second NBA title in three seasons.
There was a scary moment late in the first quarter when James collapsed to the floor after running head-first into the shoulder of teammate Tristan Thompson. The four-times MVP laid on the floor several seconds before being helped up.
 


On Tuesday evening, Scooter Gennett of the Cincinnati Reds did two things he had never before done in 502 previous Major League games: First, the 5-foot-10-inch utility infielder played left field. Second? He smote four home runs.
On most nights in June, at least 30 men play left field in Major League Baseball games. In the 148-year history of the national pastime, only 17 men—including Gennett—have ever hit four home runs in one game. It is a feat rarer than a perfect game, of which there have been 23. “It’s just short of a miracle,” Gennett, who entered the game in the midst of an 0-for-19 slump, told reporters. “It’s surreal, man. It really is.”
In this photo taken Monday night, Gennett hit an RBI double versus the Cardinals.   USA TODAY SPORTS
Baseball’s 162-game season is an epic odyssey as opposed to a sprint. It is Chaucer’s Canterbury Tales, not a spell-binding whodunnit. During a six-month journey there are plenty of side streets along the main boulevard of standings and statistical leaders. Thus, even though the Houston Astros, who have baseball’s best record (42-17), had an 11-game win streak snapped last night by the Kansas City Royals, the unlikely feat of Gennett, who only two months ago was cut by the Milwaukee Brewers, is far more enthralling.
The Reds beat the St. Louis Cardinals 13-1 Tuesday night. Gennett went five-for-five, hitting his four home runs off three Cardinal pitchers and amassing 10 RBI. Batting fifth, he had an RBI single in the bottom of the first inning. The 27 year-old Cincinnati native added a grand slam in the fourth inning, a two-run blast in the fourth, a solo bomb in the sixth, and a second two-run shot in the eighth. His first two home runs each traveled over 400 feet.

Gennett, who entered Tuesday night with three home runs in 111 at-bats this season, joins Hall of Famers such as Lou Gehrig, Willie Mays and Mike Schmidt on the short list of four-homer standouts. In his fifth major league season, he entered Tuesday night’s game with 38 career home runs and only got the start because Monday’s batting practice was rained out, preventing Reds manager Bryan Price from getting injured left fielder Scott Schebler some much-needed cuts before rejoining the lineup. He is the first member of the Reds, a franchise whose origin (1866) predates professional baseball and that counts Pete Rose and Ken Griffey Jr., as alumni, to hit four home runs in one game.

The first pro player ever to hit four home runs in a game was second baseman Bobby Lowe of the Boston Beaneaters, who on May 30, 1894 went for the quadruple in a 20-11 win against the Cincinnati Reds. Lowe played 18 seasons but only totaled 71 career home runs. His career dinger total was the lowest of any player to smack four over the fence in one game…until Tuesday night.
Only one week ago, the career .281 hitter made national news, or at least his jersey number did. When former Cincinnati All-Star second baseman Brandon Phillips, now with the Atlanta Braves, learned that the Reds had given his jersey number to an unheralded utility infielder named Scooter Gennett, he groused “I still can’t believe that…someone is wearing my number. I think that’s a slap in my face.… ”
As it turns out, someone with the Reds’ equipment staff may be prescient. The number in question that Phillips ceded to Gennett: 4.
 


Over the past two seasons, the role of chasing pack for the Premier League title has been left solely to Tottenham Hotspur.
In 2016, Mauricio Pochettino’s team trailed Leicester City for the majority of the season but couldn’t keep up the pressure, coming in second, after Arsenal. A year later, Spurs forced  Chelsea to the penultimate game of the season to wrap up the title, but, ultimately, there was no trophy for Pochettino’s men.
His team faces a transitional period with its 2017–18 season home games at Wembley Stadium, while its White Hart Lane arena is demolished and rebuilt next door. As Pochettino prepares for his fourth season in north London,  Newsweek  looks at what he needs to address this summer.
Pochettino’s only concern between the posts will be if one of Europe’s giants looks to lure goalkeeper Hugo Lloris away from Spurs. Lloris has proven to be a world-class goalkeeper, worthy of a Premier League–winning team. His deputy, Michel Vorm, is more than capable to stand in when called upon.
With defenders Toby Alderweireld and Jan Vertonghen at its center, Tottenham Hotspur had the best defense in the Premier League last season. Pochettino also adopted a back-three later in the season, with Eric Dier at the heart. And it is Dier who is believed to be a subject of interest for  Jose Mourinho at Manchester United, and one worth £40 million, according to  The Daily Telegraph.
Like much of the squad, defenders in the first team are of the highest quality, but Spurs may have to look for reinforcements. Kyle Walker’s exit from the club appears inevitable, with Pochettino preferring Kieran Trippier in the latter stage of last season. Manchester City reportedly wants to sign the English right back. So Pochettino will need to be in the market for a fullback to deputize for Trippier, as well as backup to Alderweireld and Vertonghen, who face playing more than 40 games again next season. Southampton’s  Virgil van Dijk is said to have been on that list, and would fit in well as a competent, skillful center back, but Spurs is likely to be priced out of the market as Southampton wants at least £50 million for him.

Much of the noise around Spurs so far this summer has been to do with players heading for the exit. Moussa Sissoko, who signed from Newcastle last summer, called his first year at White Hart Lane the “worst season” of his career. “If I have to leave, I hope they [Spurs] won’t cause a problem,” the Frenchman told  L’Equipe. The concern for Pochettino, however, will be if Barcelona comes in for Christian Eriksen, the Dane who has starred in Spurs midfield since he moved from Ajax in 2013. “Barcelona are a great club, and I do not think there are many who say no to Barcelona,” Eriksen told  Ekstra Bladet.
In terms of incomings, news in Germany that Bayern Munich is willing to sell Renato Sanches and Douglas Costa this summer will spark the interest of Pochettino. The Argentine coach has been on the lookout for a pacy winger—Sissoko was meant to be that man—and Costa would fit that profile. Tottenham is likely to face competition from United, however, for his signature.
Ever since Pochettino took over at Tottenham, he has been searching for a second striker to take the burden of goals from Harry Kane. Pochettino thought Roberto Soldado would be that man, but the Spaniard scored just seven times in two years at the club. Kane has consistently delivered, winning the Premier League Golden Boot last season with 29 goals, as well as providing seven assists. Last summer, he was joined by Vincent Janssen, the 22-year-old Dutch striker, but he has failed to fulfil the expectation in his first year at Spurs; Janssen scored just six goals in 38 appearances for the club.
He is still only 22 and scored twice for Holland on Wednesday night, showing his capability. But Pochettino will need to decide whether to stick or twist on Janssen before the start of the new campaign, with a second striker pivotal to Tottenham breaking its 10-year wait for a major trophy.


Antonio Conte’s first season in English football could have hardly gone better. Chelsea stormed to the Premier League title, qualified for the Champions League and would have done the double had it not lost the FA Cup final to Arsenal.
But  Conte has known for some months that his club will need to work hard this summer to improve the squad and prepare it for the arduous European campaign ahead. And  the Italian wanted to make sure that he was at the center of those preparations.
In March, he  reportedly told Chelsea he wanted to have greater control over transfers if he were to sign a contract extension.  Conte was unhappy at the way experienced first-team players—Oscar, Branislav Ivanovic and John Obi Mikel—were allowed to leave in January. Here,  Newsweek looks at the business of comings and goings expected at Stamford Bridge this summer:
Goalkeeper
Asmir Begovic has already gone through the exit door at Chelsea and through the entrance at the Vitality Stadium, joining Eddie Howe’s Bournemouth and leaving the Londoners in need of a reserve goalkeeper. Eduardo may be that man after signing a one-year extension at the Bridge that may see him fill the role behind Thibaut Courtois, however PSG’s Alphonse Areola has also been  linked with a move to the Bridge.
Courtois, the Belgian goalkeeper who won the Golden Glove award last season, has long been linked with a move to Real Madrid, but the Spanish giant sees Manchester United’s David De Gea as its main target this summer.  Reports in March said the 25-year-old would turn down a move to the Bernabeu if an offer came in anyway.
Defense
Who would have thought a defense with David Luiz at its center could have proved so solid? But it did: Chelsea had the third best back line in the Premier League last season. But Conte is said to be keen to add strength and experience, and at the heart of his defense in particular, with Juventus’ Leonardo Bonucci believed to be a main target.
The club has, of course, said farewell to its captain John Terry, who leaves Chelsea this summer after 22 years at Stamford Bridge, where he won every trophy available. This leaves Conte with Kurt Zouma and Nathan Ake, both 22, as his options outside starters Luiz, Gary Cahill and Cesar Azpilicueta.
One of the defining features of Conte’s team and his first season at Chelsea was his 3-4-3 formation, with two wingbacks. Victor Moses and Marcos Alonso have filled those roles but, due to their importance, Conte will need reinforcements on both sides this summer.
Midfield
The future of Cesc Fabregas remains uncertain. The creative Spaniard was a key figure in Conte’s title-winning team, but his involvement frequently came from the substitutes’ bench. That is unlikely to change next season, leaving the 30-year-old to make a decision on whether to stay or go.
Chelsea is favorite to sign Monaco’s talented center midfielder Tiemoue Bakayoko, according to the  Daily Mail, which says the 22-year-old is valued at around £40 million ($52 million). With the industrious insurance of N’Golo Kante in midfield, Conte can afford to have someone with more license for creativity alongside the PFA Player of the Year. PSG’s talented and creative Marco Verratti is one of the leading contenders to also have been linked with a move to Stamford Bridge.
Attack
Diego Costa: Does he stay or does he go? Costa was meant to be on his way out in January, linked with a move to the Chinese Super League, but a Chelsea player he remained. This summer was expected to be the end, but  Costa has said he would only leave Chelsea for a return to Atletico Madrid; that won’t be happening this summer because the Spanish club is under a transfer ban.
But Conte will recognize that his team was heavily reliant on the 28-year-old’s goals last season, many of them game-winners for the champion. So, the club will be seeking the services of a competent striker to support—or possibly replace—Costa.  Romelu Lukaku could be set to return to Stamford Bridge and, according to  The Times, he wants to. Real Madrid’s speedster  Alvaro Morata, who is also dangerous in the air, is believed to be on Conte’s wanted list, while the club is also monitoring the situation with Alexis Sanchez at Arsenal.
There is a concern among Chelsea fans that  Eden Hazard could be heading for the exit this summer, with Real Madrid potentially paying a world-record fee for the Belgian. But Hazard broke his ankle while in training with the national team this week which is likely to stall any deal with Real.


With just two days to go before English football’s transfer window slides open, news and rumors of comings and goings in the Premier League are rife.
On Friday, June 9, clubs will have an opportunity to improve: right the wrongs of last season by signing a dependable center back to retain  Premier League status; capture that 20-goal-a-season striker who can take you closer to qualifying for the  Champions League; or bring in that playmaker who was the missing link last year.
Record numbers are expected to be spent, but, somehow, some clubs have already begun. On May 27, six days after the final game of the season and two weeks before the window opened,  Manchester City announced the signing of  Bernardo Silva from Monaco, a deal believed to be worth £43.6 million (about $56.6 million).
The club released an  in-house interview with the winger. “It feels great,” he said. “Now, I’m in one of the best teams in the world and to be part of this club and part of this team, I’m very happy.” Five days later, Benfica announced that City had paid £35 million (about $45.2 million) for its goalkeeper Ederson, according to the  BBC.
After his first trophyless season as a manager,  Pep Guardiola has been swift to prepare for the new Premier League season that will begin in August. But, how was he able to spend $110 million before the transfer window even opened?
In a statement sent to  Newsweek , FIFA said: “The registration period concerns the registration of a player for a club. According to art. 6 par. 1 of the Regulations on the Status and Transfer of Players, players may only be registered during one of the two annual registration periods fixed by the relevant association.
“Furthermore, in order for a player to be eligible to participate in organised football for a specific club, he or she must be registered at an association to play for that club (cf. art. 5 par. 1 of the aforementioned Regulations).”
Put simply, a club can sign a player any day of the year it likes. The transfer window only stipulates when a player can be registered to a club.
In the case of Manchester City, the club may have paid more than $110 million for players this summer but, until the paperwork is complete with FIFA, they cannot officially represent the club competitively.
An example of these rules in play was seen in Catalonia in July 2015. Barcelona completed the signing of Arda Turan from Atletico Madrid, in a deal believed to be worth £24 million (about $31 million), but the Turkey international would be unable to play for the club until January 2016.
This was due to the fact Barcelona was under a transfer ban for breaching rules on acquiring players under the age of 18. Even though the ban was in place, the La Liga giant could buy players, it just couldn’t register them.


The burden of signing players at Manchester United this summer will fall solely on the shoulders of CEO Ed Woodward after Jose Mourinho says he is “fed up” of football after an exhausting first year at Old Trafford.
United is expected to have another busy summer when the transfer window opens on June 9, with  Mourinho reportedly giving Woodward a list of four players he wants. Reports have linked the club with strikers  Romelu Lukaku, Alvaro Morata and Antoine Griezmann and defender Victor Lindelof.
Signing for  United has become a more attractive prospect after the club qualified for next season’s Champions League by winning the Europa League in May,  Mourinho’s third trophy of the season, after the League Cup and Charity Shield. And it was after the Europa League final in Stockholm that  Mourinho revealed that Woodward knows the targets he wants.
“Ed Woodward has my list, what I want, what I would like for more than two months,” he told BT Sport. “So now it’s up to him and the owners. But I don’t care about football for now.”
He reiterated the message Tuesday, insisting the signings would be up to Woodward, who became executive vice-chairman at the club in 2012.

“This year, I had the most difficult season of my career,” Mourinho told VLT, as quoted by the  Manchester Evening News. “We played all of the games that were possible minus two.
“I got fed up and tired of football until the last day. I promised that you would not see me in football stadiums, and I stopped negotiating for players and being worried.
“I handed my list to the CEO in April and he has until August 31 to give me what I want, or not.”
If Everton striker Lukaku was on that list, United appears to have had a poor start to the summer after the Belgian chose a move back to Chelsea over joining Mourinho,  The Times reported.
A striker will certainly be on Mourinho’s list as Zlatan Ibrahimovic suffered an injury that will likely see him miss the start of next season. The 35 year old’s contract at United will expire in the summer, though the club said it will continue to support his recovery from injury.
Woodward has delivered top transfers in the past. Last summer, he oversaw the signing of Paul Pogba from Juventus for £90 million (about $116 million) that broke the world transfer record. That summer the club also signed Ibrahimovic, the top scorer last season, as well as Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Eric Bailly.


With just two days to go before the transfer window officially opens in English football, the Premier League’s big players are all in action in the market.
Jose Mourinho has suggested he wants to take a step back from negotiations this summer but, in today’s round-up, the  Manchester United manager is looking to grab a bargain from one of Italy’s biggest clubs.John Terry needs a new home following his departure from  Chelsea after 22 years, and his former club has pipped all its rivals to what could end up being the signing of the summer. Here,  Newsweek gives you all the news and rumors circling in the  Premier League today:
Mourinho is looking to capitalize on Inter Milan’s need to meet Financial Fair Play regulations by making £26 million by June 30, as he looks to sign  Ivan Perisic below market value, according to  Gazzetta dello Sport .  The 28-year-old winger is said to be valued at closer to £45 million.
Another team looking for a bargain today is Bournemouth and its manager Eddie Howe who has been in talks with  John Terry, the former Chelsea captain, about bringing him to the Vitality Stadium,  The Sun says. Brighton and Hove Albion, newly promoted to the Premier League, has withdrawn its interest due to Terry wanting £100,000-a-week in wages, the  London Evening Standard says.
Terry’s former club Chelsea has also had a boost this morning after  The Times reported that  Romelu Lukaku, the Everton striker, wants to rejoin the Premier League champion. The  Belgian striker was the subject of interest for Manchester United but has told his agent Mino Raiola to take him back to Stamford Bridge.
Lukaku’s departure will see Ronald Koeman lose his best player at Goodison Park, but, according to the  Liverpool Echo, the Everton board will give its Dutch coach a record sum to spend this summer.
Real Madrid is looking to snap up Monaco’s 18-year-old star  Kylian Mbappe from Premier League rivals, says  The Independent. But Arsene Wenger, the Arsenal manager, has told the French forward to choose a club where he will play regular football, the  Daily Mail says.
Wenger may also be in danger of losing one of his most talented youngsters this summer.  The Independent reports that Barcelona is willing to offer the London club £45 million for 22-year-old defender  Hector Bellerin.
Manchester United flop  Bebe could be on his way back to English football form Eibar. The Portuguese forward is in talks, the  Daily Mail says, with Championship club Wolves.


On the run-in to the start of the America’s Cup semifinal on Tuesday, New Zealand’s catamaran capsized in spectacular style.
Three members of the crew were thrown overboard in the waters off Bermuda while some were suspended in the hull above the water. When it was all over, all were accounted for, though.
New Zealand was competing in the best-of-nine semifinal against Great Britain, and it still holds a 3-1 lead in the series despite losing on Tuesday.
“In 30 years of racing, I’ve never seen anything like that,” Sir Ben Ainslie, skipper of Britain’s Land Rover BAR boat, said, as quoted by the  BBC.
“All of us sitting here are not going to pass criticism—these boats are incredibly hard to sail and these things can happen.”
In the other semifinal, Japan recorded two more wins over Sweden to take its lead to 3-1 in the series. The first team to reach five in each tie will progress to the challenger final for a chance to take on the American team.
The fifth and sixth races of each semifinal will take place on Wednesday.



Pixie haircuts may be the new rage on the girl's soccer field now that superstar Mia Hamm cheered an 8-year-girl whose Nebraska team was booted from a tournament after officials insisted she was a boy.
U.S. soccer legend Hamm and Olympic soccer gold medalist Abby Wambach launched a Twitter defense of Mili Hernandez, the Omaha, Nebraska girl whose team, Assurri Cachorros Chicos, was disqualified from a Springfield Soccer Club tournament over the weekend.
After a typo on the team roster misidentified the short-haired Hernandez as male, her family told NBC affiliate WOWT News that tournament officials ignored insurance documents produced to prove she is female and instead kicked out the entire team.
"Mili, don't EVER let anyone tell you that you aren't perfect just as you are. I won championships with short hair," Wambach tweeted late on Monday.
Hamm also took to Twitter to invite Hernandez to her TeamFirst Soccer Academy.
"Be you!" Hamm added to the tweet late on Monday.
The club has filed a complaint with the Nebraska State Soccer Association, local media reported.
The Hernandez family could not be reached for comment. Neither Nebraska soccer officials or the Azzuri club immediately responded to requests for comment.
Hernandez told WOWT that she was "not happy" that officials disqualified her team because of her appearance.
"They only did it because I look like a boy," Hernandez told WOWT News in a televised interview.
TeamFirst spokeswoman Cori Boyle told Reuters on Tuesday the academy would consider running a camp in Nebraska if Hernandez is unable to attend any of the other camps currently scheduled in the U.S. Midwest. TeamFirst camps focus on "being yourself, being proud of who you are, being the best you can be, as a person," Boyle said.
She added, "A lot of professional athletes have short hair... I have short hair."


Jurgen Klopp spent much of last season in between Antonio Conte and Pep Guardiola, chasing one and trying to get away from the other. His Liverpool team ended fourth, behind Chelsea and Manchester City.
But, in today’s  transfer round-up of news and rumors, the Liverpool manager looks to have beaten the pair. Conte’s Chelsea and Guardiola’s City are in the market for a center back but Klopp appears to have been the most attractive prospect, and the deal looks likely to break a world record.
Arsene Wenger, meanwhile, has been snapped in his home country of France but is said to be there to wrap up a deal that could break the world transfer record. But other reports say he’s already been beaten by the might of  Real Madrid.
Here,  Newsweek  takes you through all the reports and whispers going round in the transfer market:
Real Madrid center back  Pepe has confirmed he is leaving the Santiago Bernabeu this summer, and the 34-year-old told Spanish radio station Cope that “there are more offers, also from England.”
Virgil van Dijk is close to becoming the world’s most expensive defender, according to the  Daily Mail, as Liverpool is willing to pay £60 million to Southampton for him. Van Dijk, 25, is said to have chosen working with Jurgen Klopp at Liverpool over Chelsea’s Antonio Conte and Manchester City’s Pep Guardiola.
Conte will, instead, look to his former club Juventus and  Leonardo Bonucci as a defensive signing this summer, according to  The Sun. Conte won three Serie A title with the Italian defender during his time with Juventus.
Barcelona’s new head coach  Ernesto Valverde is looking to make Arsenal defender  Hector Bellerin his first signing since taking over at the Camp Nou,  The Mirror says.
But the same  newspaper also believes that Arsene Wenger, the Arsenal manager, is currently busy in Nice, France looking to wrap up signings, in particular for Monaco’s  Kylian Mbappe.
However, the 18-year-old is also being targeted by some of Europe’s biggest clubs, including Real Madrid, which, according to  The Sun, has made a world-record £118 million offer for  Mbappe.
Everton’s  Romelu Lukaku has been the subject of interest for both Chelsea and Manchester United over the past couple of years, but German giant Bayern Munich is looking to sneak in and sign the prolific Belgian, according to the  Manchester Evening News. Lukaku, 24, was the second highest goalscorer in the Premier League last season after Harry Kane, of Spurs.
And it is the north London club, Spurs, which may have concerns this morning about the words of one of its key players.  The Independent has quoted  Christian Eriksen, via  Ekstra Bladet, as saying a move to Barcelona would be tempting.  


For good reason Austria's Dominic Thiem knows he will have to find a new weapon when he takes on defending champion Novak Djokovic for a place in the French Open semi-finals on Tuesday.
The sixth seed's single-handed backhand ranks as one of the best shots in men's tennis but so far it has been feeble against Djokovic who he has scraped one set against in five matches and who thrashed him 6-1 6-0 in the Rome semi-finals.
He was also beaten in straight sets by Djokovic in last year's semi-finals at Roland Garros—his best run at a slam.
"I have to change something compared to the last matches," Thiem, the youngest of the quarter-finalists, said.
"I will talk to my coach, to my team. Then maybe change something up and hope I play a good match."
Second seed Djokovic's progress has been troublesome in comparison, being stretched to five sets by Diego Schwartzman in round three—but the battle-hardened Serb is well-versed in the business end of slams and usually raises his game.
Former champion Mats Wilander thinks 23-year-old Thiem's easy run could actually work against him.
Of course, it's good to have conserved your energy, but for Thiem I think I'd have liked to see him answer a few more questions," the Swede, in Paris as a presenter for Eurosport's daily flagship show "Game, Set and Mats", told Reuters.
"For someone like Thiem it's vital to have energy left. But at the same time when you are standing up against Novak Djokovic it's just a different animal in terms of pressure."


On Sunday, 70,000 fans packed into Old Trafford, the home of Manchester United football club, to see a special reunion.
Former goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar, now director of football at Ajax, returned to the stadium he played at for six years, from 2005 through 2011. Patrice Evra traded the sky blue of Marseille back to the red of United.  Ryan Giggs, Rio Ferdinand and  Paul Scholes took their boots down off the hanger and pulled the club jersey on once again.
The team in red was full of representatives of the  Manchester United team of 2008, the team that won the European Cup and Premier League. Its opposition: Michael Carrick All-Stars, for this day was all about the 35-year-old midfielder; it was his testimonial match.
But what is the point of a testimonial match, and where did the craze in football begin?  Newsweek  takes a look:
At its core, a testimonial is intended to raise a sum of money at the end of a player’s career, having been with a club for a significant period—but it is the recipient of those funds that has changed over the last two decades.
When the idea was formed in the early 1900s—and still to present day in lower leagues—a testimonial was a game played at the end, or nearing the end, of a player’s career. The proceeds from the game would all go to the retiring player to help ease him into retirement. Billy Meredith, of Manchester United, is one of the earliest recorded testimonials having taken place in 1912, but Meredith claimed not to have been given the full amount.
Football is not the only sport to hold testimonials. In 2005, former England rugby captain and World Cup winner Martin Johnson had a testimonial held at Twickenham stadium in London as he retired from the sport.
Even to the turn of the Millennium, the highest paid footballers were still getting a bumper paycheck at the end of their careers. In 2001, a year before he retired as Arsenal’s goalkeeper, 33,297 paid to get into Highbury and watch the testimonial for David Seaman in north London. The match, according to  The Daily Telegraph, saw Seaman receive around £600,000 (about $776,000). Former Sunderland striker Niall Quinn is said to have raised £1 million at his testimonial in 2002. Nowadays, however, players in the Premier League receive such high wages that a new trend has begun—giving the proceeds to charity.
Former Liverpool center back, Jamie Carragher, now a pundit for Sky Sports, held his testimonial at Anfield in 2010, nine years after Seaman’s. He called upon former teammates, such as Michael Owen, Emile Heskey and Jerzy Dudek, to play against an Everton XI. The match at Anfield raised £1 million that went to Carragher’s 23 Foundation, which releases the proceeds to charities within the Liverpool area.
Michael Carrick’s testimonial also saw all funds being donated to charity. But, as with Carrick’s match, the event has also become a celebration of a player’s career with the subject addressing the crowd at the end of the match. On Sunday, as quoted by  The Guardian, Carrick said: “The atmosphere was incredible. There was no way I could have hoped for anything like this. I know we get full houses here every week but it is not something I take for granted and to get so many here today is sensational.”
John Terry and Frank Lampard are the two players synonymous with Chelsea FC over the past two decades but neither player was given a testimonial. Terry and Lampard have won the Premier League, Champions League, FA Cup and League Cup together but there was no match to mark their departures.
In December 2013, the MLS had its first ever testimonial match. Players from the 2006-07 Houston Dynamos squad attended BBVA Compass Stadium in Texas for Brian Ching’s final game for the club. He left the pitch to a cheer of “Thank You Brian.”


Former Newcastle United and Ivory Coast player Cheick Tiote collapsed and died during a training session in China Monday. The 30-year-old was training with the Chinese second-tier side Beijing Enterprises, which he joined just four months ago, when he collapsed and was taken to hospital. He later died after receiving emergency treatment.
After a flood of reports on social media, Tiote’s agent confirmed the news.
“It is with deep sadness that I confirm that my client Cheick Tiote sadly passed away earlier today after collapsing in training with his club Beijing Enterprises,” Emanuele Paladino said, according to Sky Sports News.
“We cannot say any more at the moment and we request that his family's privacy be respected at this difficult time. We ask for all your prayers."

Reports have suggested Tiote suffered a heart attack. His wife was said to be expecting a baby this week.
Even more tragically am told Cheick Tioté&#39;s wife is expecting a baby this week #rip

Prior to joining the Chinese club, Tiote spent more than six years at English Premier League side Newcastle, where he established himself as a fan favorite with a series of committed midfield performances. He is best remembered for a stunning long-range goal in February 2011 to complete a famous comeback for Newcastle from 4-0 down to draw 4-4 with Arsenal. It was his first and only goal for the North-East club.
Tiote’s former manager at Newcastle United, Rafa Benitez said: “It is with great sadness that I have this afternoon learned of Cheick's death. In the all the time that I have known him, he was a true professional, dedicated and above all, a great man. Our hearts go out to his family and friends at such a sad time.”

Before his stay on Tyneside, Tiote made a name from himself in Europe, first in Belgian with Anderlecht and then more notably in the Netherlands with FC Twente, which he helped to win its first ever league title. After representing Ivory Coast in the 2010 World Cup, he earned a transfer to Newcastle and went on to make almost 150 league appearances.
He also played more than 50 times for his country, including at the 2014 as well as the 2010 World Cup. He was a part of the Ivory Coast team that won the 2015 Africa Cup of Nations.
Some of his former teammates quickly took to social media to express their shock and condolences. 
Gutted to hear the awful news about my former teammate Cheik Tiote today. Thoughts with his friends and family.
Terrible news, R.I.P. Tiote. Always enjoyed sitting next to you in the dressing room my friend.
Ya akhi, narakum fi jannah inshallah.I see you in heaven my brother #rip https://t.co/h32efMsCXc
 
Goodnight brother, You will be missed. My heart goes out to his family. Gone too soon #RIPcheiktiote

Steph Curry starred in the best play of the NBA Finals on Sunday when he slipped past LeBron James to score and ultimately help Golden State Warriors toward a 2-0 lead in the series.
Early in the third quarter at ORACLE Arena in Oakland, Curry picked up the ball but found his route to the basket blocked by James. He dips back, and pivots from side to side before effortlessly slipping past  James to put the Warriors 10 points ahead.
James’ triple-double on Sunday saw him shine once again in the postseason but his Cavaliers still fell to a 132-113 defeat in Game Two, and being beaten by Curry will have added to James’ pain. Take a look here:  



On Sunday, Eden Hazard suggested there was a chance he could finish the summer with the champion of Europe rather than England.
The  Belgian, who starred in  Chelsea’s title-winning campaign this season, was on international duty when he answered questions over his future.
Hazard has been  constantly linked with a move to Real Madrid, and he refused to rule out the transfer, having watched the Spanish giant win the European Cup for successive years on Saturday.
“If you look at the last two season, it looks easy for them,” he said, as quoted by the  Het Laatste Nieuws newspaper. “The Champions League is a particularly difficult competition to win. Real Madrid were stronger than anyone in the last two to three seasons. But that doesn’t mean it’ll be the same in the next five years. The Champions League is a goal for me for next season. I’ve never won it and I’m always trying to improve.”
Asked whether he would consider an offer from  Real Madrid, Hazard said: “Of course I’ll listen. We all have dreams. It could be Spain, it could be staying with Chelsea. I’m good where I am now. I think I can stay at Chelsea for many years. But it’s not something I’m thinking about right now. We’ll see.”
Those words would have troubled Chelsea as it prepares for a summer of speculation over Hazard’s future, with the transfer window open for three months, until September 1. Potential replacements would have been lined up in the event that Hazard did head for the exit at Stamford Bridge, but just hours after his comments on the move, he suffered a fracture to his ankle during a training session.
Hazard, crowned PFA Player of the Year for 2015, is  reportedly back in London and preparing for surgery on Monday, with his recovery set to take two to three months.
According to the  Evening Standard, Real Madrid has cooled its interest in Hazard after the fracture to his ankle, and is looking at Monaco’s  Kylian Mbappe instead.
The 18-year-old is said to be a target for Arsenal this summer but is likely to be trumped by the financial might of Madrid.
Mbappe scored 24 goals in 42 appearances for the Ligue 1 club last season, helping take the team to the semifinals of the Champions League.


After Cleveland Cavaliers slipped further behind in the NBA Finals on Sunday night, LeBron James was in no mood for questions over his team’s tactics.
James, 32, made a triple-double for the  Cavaliers in a spirited performance, but he couldn’t stop Golden State Warriors winning Game Two 132-113 and taking a 2-0 lead in the series.
After the match,  James chose not to attend the post-game press conference and instead spoke to a media scrum. But he wasn’t too pleased with the line of questioning. Take a look:

Three times Wimbledon champion Novak Djokovic said Sunday he will not change plans or preparations for the tournament next month after an attack in London on Saturday left seven people dead and 48 injured.
A van rammed into pedestrians on London Bridge and three attackers with knifes charged out and stabbed others nearby.
"Everything will progress the same in terms of my plans for Wimbledon and I will try to go there with family, and of course be conscious," Djokovic said at the French Open.
"I think it's always about being conscious of what time of the day or night you go, where do you go, but, you know, it's very unpredictable."
A French national and a Canadian were among those killed. Australia said one of its citizens was among the injured.
Police, who fired about 50 bullets, shot dead the three male assailants in the Borough Market area near London Bridge within eight minutes of receiving the first emergency call shortly after 10 p.m. (2100 GMT).
"It's very disturbing that one of the biggest cities in the world, most important cities in the world, some of the most popular locations in the town suffering these terrorist attacks," said Djokovic.
"So of course it makes you wonder a little bit, makes you question certain things.
"I mean, if we live in fear, you know, that's not life. I also believe that you kind of attract, you know, certain things that when you are, you know, living under stress and fear of everything," he said.
Wimbledon, the year's third grand slam, runs from July 3 to 16.


The standout of today’s Premier League transfer round-up has to be Jurgen Klopp’s Liverpool.
Fourth in the table, with Champions League football to prepare for, Klopp’s approach to the transfer market, according to these reports, has reflected his gegenpressing style of play.
The Anfield club is looking to wrap up the signing of a world-class striker, a skillful winger, and sneak in to sign a defensive target of its Premier League rivals.
Arsenal also features heavily as it looks to secure the future of key players, while Leicester City is facing the prospect of its Premier League winning team crumbling apart. Here,  Newsweek  gives you the latest on today’s comings and goings:
Liverpool has had a good start to the week as the club is set to meet the representatives of  Alexandre Lacazette , the prolific Lyon striker, according to the  Daily Express. The club is also still confident about luring Southampton center back  Virgil van Dijk to Anfield, the  Liverpool Echo say, despite Manchester City’s reported £50 million bid.
Klopp’s club is also edging closer to wrapping up a £35 million deal for former Chelsea winger  Mohamed Salah , currently with Italian club Roma, according to the  Daily Mirror.
But Klopp is also having to fend off interest. Juventus, which lost the Champions League final on Saturday, is said to be keen on  Emre Can but Liverpool will offer the German midfielder a new contract, the  Daily Mail say, to secure his future.  
The  Daily Mail is also reporting interest from Juventus in Arsenal goalkeeper  Wojciech Szczesny as the Italian giant looks for a long-term successor to Gianluigi Buffon.  
Arsenal is keen to secure the future of some of its key first-team players, such as Alexis Sanchez and Mesut Ozil, and the club also looks set to keep  Olivier Giroud . According to  ESPN, the French striker wants to remain at the Emirates Stadium to win the Premier League.
Arsene Wenger has tempered fans expectations this summer over incomings at the Emirates,  The Independent say, after claiming there will be no more than three signings at Arsenal.
Across London, champion Chelsea has two concerns about star forward  Eden Hazard this morning. First, he broke his ankle while on duty with Belgium this weekend. Second, that may not be their problem after the 2015 PFA Player of the Year told  FourFourTwo he would consider a move to Champions League winner Real Madrid if an offer came in.
And, finally, the transfer merry-go-round may see Leicester’s title-winning team of last year continue to be torn apart. N’Golo Kante left last summer for Chelsea; Riyad Mahrez says he wants to go during this window; and now, according to the  Daily Express, Everton has settled on  Jamie Vardy as  Romelu Lukaku’s replacement should the Belgian be snapped up, having been linked with Chelsea and Manchester United.


Golden State Warriors head coach Steve Kerr will take charge of the team for the remainder of the NBA Finals, he told reporters on Sunday.
He relinquished his role during the first round of the playoffs in late April due to complications resulting from back surgery two years ago.
Speaking shortly before Game Two against the Cleveland Cavaliers, Kerr said he was feeling somewhat better.
"I wanted to string together a few good days,” he told reporters. “I did that. I’m excited, and it’s good to be back.”
And it will have felt even better when the Warriors took a 2-0 lead in the series after beating the Cavaliers 132-113 in Game Two. 
The Cavaliers produced a significantly improved performance on the first game of the series as LeBron James made a triple-double, the team forced 20 turnovers and 15 steals, and yet it still wasn't enough. 
Victory for Golden State was the team's 14th consecutive win in the playoffs, equaling the longest post-season win streak in the league's history. 
The performances of James, Steph Curry and Kevin Durant, saw the battle for MVP heighten while the championship looks close to being tied up. 
But the biggest cheer from the crowd at the Oracle Arena was saved for Kerr as he returned to the bench for the first time during the post-season.

Cristiano Ronaldo struck twice as Real Madrid became the first team to successfully defend their European title in the Champions League era with a 4-1 win over Juventus in Saturday's final for their third triumph in four years.
Real, who now have a record 12 European Cup wins, grabbed the lead in the 20th minute through Ronaldo, who slotted the ball low into the corner after a clever cut-back from Dani Carvajal following a classic counter attack.
But determined Italian champions Juve drew level seven minutes later, with one of the finest goals seen in a Champions League final, as Croatian forward Mario Mandzukic beat Real keeper Keylor Navas with a perfectly executed overhead kick.
The Spanish champions took charge after the break, however, restoring their lead through a deflected long-range shot from Brazilian Casemiro in the 61st minute before Portugal forward Ronaldo struck again, from close-range, after fine work by Luka Modric, to score his 600th goal for club and country.
Juve finished with 10 men after Juan Cuadrado was sent off in the 84th for a second yellow card after pushing Sergio Ramos and in the final minute of normal time substitute Marco Asensio added a fourth after some poor defending from the Italians.


Plans to host Major League Baseball’s regular-season games in Europe have been revived, with a target start date of 2019.
London is likely to be one of the first cities on the continent to host MLB. Last year, talks over hosting a match at the London Stadium, home to the West Ham United football team, fell through, but London Mayor Sadiq Khan met with MLB commissioner Rob Manfred in September to discuss the idea further.
A Baseball Battleground event, organized by MLB, will be held in London’s iconic Hyde Park on July 4. Representatives of the Boston Red Sox and Los Angeles Dodgers will compete in a home-run derby.
London has already  hosted sporting events from the States, such as American football and  NBA at Wembley Stadium and the O2 Arena.
MLB has already presented regular season matches in other parts of the world, with Australia, Japan and Mexico hosting games. Manfred is keen to add the English capital to the list.
“It is something we would really like to do in 2019,” he said, as quoted by  The Guardian. “We do think it’s time, whether it’s 2019 or shortly thereafter, that we play in Europe.”
Charlie Hill, the managing director of MLB Europe, said the event in Hyde Park next month represented the “statement of intent to grow Major League Baseball” across the continent.
“Hyde Park is the perfect location to bring a flavor of our game to London, with two of the most popular teams in the sport—the Red Sox and the Dodgers—set to provide a night of big hitting,” he said.


When manager David Moyes stepped out of the Stamford Bridge dugout in the last game of the Premier League season, his Sunderland team beaten 5-1 by Chelsea and already well relegated from the division, he had a message for the club’s fans.
“We have to give them the positives and aim to get back [to the Premier League] as quickly as we can,” he told the  BBC. Moyes resigned hours later, but the words he had spoken reflected the club’s feeling.
Sunderland, like every other team in English football, is desperate to be in the  Premier League. Sure, for the prestige of playing against the likes of  Manchester United and Liverpool, but more importantly, for the lucrative position it gives the players.
Moyes’s Sunderland dropped down to the second tier after just six wins from 38 games, conceding 69 goals along the way. And yet, the club bows out with $120 million in prize money payments, according to  sportingintelligence.com.
That figure is made up of “merit” for where the team finishes, “facility fees” for live games shown on TV in the U.K. and shares of the domestic and overseas TV deals, plus commercial income from Premier League sponsors.
According to  sportingintelligence.com, this sees Sunderland awarded more money than the winners in the German (Bayern Munich), French (Monaco) and Italian (Juventus) leagues.
A total of $3.09 billion was awarded across the Premier League. At the top, champion Chelsea was awarded just over $194 million for winning the domestic title. Manchester City was second with $190 million, and Liverpool third with $189 million.
Those great sums of money come from Sky and BT Sport, paying £5.136 billion (about $6.62 billion) between them to show Premier League matches in a deal lasting between 2016 and 2019. According to the report, another £3 billion ($3.87 billion) is made through foreign broadcasters.
 
Sunderland&#39;s £93.5m for finishing LAST in the Premier League is about 5 times the prize cash in Scotland&#39;s Premiership. All of it combined. pic.twitter.com/P77puR7vX4
 



The 24-time Grand Slam winner Margaret Court believes a “conspiracy” by the “U.S. gay lobby” is aiming to strip her name from one of the courts at Melbourne Park, home of the Australian Open.
Martina Navratilova, an 18-time major winner,  renewed the call for renaming the Margaret Court Arena on Thursday after saying the Australian’s comments were “racist and homophobic.”
Speaking to a Christian radio station the day before, Court said “tennis is full of lesbians” and that she believes transgender children are the work of “the devil.”
But Court believes the backlash to her comments is part of a conspiracy. “They have a lot of money behind them,” the 74-year-old told 3AW radio. “I think I’ve won more Grand Slams than any man or woman, and if [the stadium] is [renamed], I don’t believe I deserve it.
“They could probably get 100,000 petitions in 24 hours because that's how they work. There's a lot of money behind it, and it's coming from America.”
Asked about a possible conspiracy, Court added: “Yes, I believe there is… I think the [gay] lobby, yeah.”
Controversy surrounding the tennis great began in March, when she said she would boycott the Qantas airline “where possible” due to its support of same-sex marriage.
Navratilova responded to Court’s comments through a letter in  The Sydney Morning Herald. The Czech-American said she had forgiven Court for comments she made in 1990, when she said Navratilova was a bad role model due to her homosexuality. Navratilova added that she had been unaware of Court’s remarks about the apartheid regime in South Africa.
“South Africa has the racial situation rather better organized than anyone else, certainly much better than the United States,” the Australian said in 1970, according to the  BBC.
“It is now clear exactly who Court is: an amazing tennis player, and a racist and a homophobe,” Navratilova wrote. “Her vitriol is not just an opinion. She is actively trying to keep LGBT people from getting equal rights (note to Court: we are human beings, too). She is demonising trans kids and trans adults everywhere.”
World No.1 Andy Murray also has criticized Court’s comments and said an effort to change the name of the venue should be made in the lead-up to the next Australian Open in January.


On Wednesday, at the Court Suzanne Lenglen, Roland Garros, Ons Jabeur made history.
After beating world No. 6 Dominika Cibulkova 6-4, 6-3 at the  French Open on Wednesday, Jabeur held the Tunisian flag aloft in celebration: She had become not only the first woman from  Tunisia to make it to the third round of a Grand Slam tournament, but also the first Arab woman.
“It feels like history, of course,” Jabeur said, as quoted by  The New York Times. “But me, I like to just stay focused on the victory so I can continue to make history even more. For me, it’s not over. It’s the beginning of my dream.”
Selima Sfar, retired Tunisian player and mentor to Jabeur, is the only Arab woman to ever reach the top 100. She said: “The first emotion that awakened in me was overwhelming, tears came straight to me eyes. In a way, I feel like Ons gave meaning to whatever sacrifices I made, or difficult times I had through my journey to make it happen.”
Sfar used the words of Billie Jean King to show the impact that Jabeur’s win could have. “I love this sentence: ‘You have to see it to be it,’” she said. “And it’s really important for all the Arab countries, because we know how is the image of women in Arab countries and everything. So, if girls grow up now, they can see more and more women who did it. And they can think, ‘What is possible?’ That belief is enough to do something.”  
Jabeur said: “Well, when I win, I’m like, ‘Yeah, I represent the Arab world.’ When I lose, I try to be just Ons Jabeur.”
Newsweek  takes a look at Jabeur’s rise through the tennis world:
Age?  Born on August 28, 1994, Jabeur is 22 years old.
Where is she from?  Tunis, the capital of Tunisia. But Jabeur is based in Paris and trains in Slovakia due to the high altitude.
When did she turn professional?  2010, aged 15.
Ranking?  Wednesday’s win lifted Jabeur to No. 114 in the world. A win in the next round would lift her into the top 100.
Favored surface?  She has performed best on clay, as seen this week.
Best tournaments?  As a talented junior, she reached the girls’ final in 2010, aged 15, and then won it a year later. Here, she became the first North African woman to win a Grand Slam in any category.
Other notable appearances?  Jabeur represented Tunisia at both the 2012 and 2016 Olympic Games, but didn’t make it past the first round. She also reached the first round of the U.S. Open in 2014 and the first round of the Australian Open a year later.
Who will she face in the third round?  Timea Bacsinszky, the world No. 31, of Switzerland, on Friday.



NBA commissioner Adam Silver is frustrated by a lack of Chinese players in an otherwise highly international league and is committed to ensuring the basketball-loving Asian nation has greater representation in the United States. 
"It frustrates me that there are no Chinese players in the NBA right now," he told reporters prior to Game One of the NBA Finals in Oakland on Thursday.
"There's probably more basketball being played in China than anywhere else in the world. And more NBA basketball is being watched in China than anywhere else in the world," he said.
While there are currently no Chinese players in the NBA, two were selected in last year's draft: Zhou Qi by the Houston Rockets and Wang Zhelin by the Memphis Grizzlies.
Silver said he was consulting with retired eight-time NBA All-Star Yao Ming, now the head of the Chinese Basketball Association (CBA), who he said was committed to seeing China excel at the Olympics, World Cup of Basketball and the NBA. 
"One of the things that we have worked on with Yao is the creation of academies in China," Silver added. 
"So we can bring together some of the best players at a young age, they can compete against each other, they can compete internationally in the summer, because ultimately that's what enables them to become NBA players."
Silver added that it made little sense a country of 1.3 billion should have no representation in the NBA while nations with a fraction of the population, like Lithuania, Serbia and Latvia, each provided several players. 
"We need to increase the pool of top-notch Chinese players," Silver said. "I think it will have a great impact on our league, and I think it will be good for Chinese basketball as well."


The suggestion from Arsenal after Arsene Wenger signed a two-year extension to his contract was that there would be some changes at the Emirates Stadium.
An incoming director of football was a possibility, a youthful coach to learn and, eventually, succeed  Wenger was also among the considerations. But it is in the transfer market that Wenger has been told to change, to be more assertive.
In today’s round-up of the comings and goings in Premier League football, there are certainly noises that he is doing that. Elsewhere,  Jose Mourinho looks to other striking options after “cooling” interest in Antoine Griezmann, and Bayern Munich’s players are acting as recruiters at the Allianz Arena.
Here,  Newsweek  takes you through all the news and rumors circling English football on Friday morning:
And where better to start than Arsenal’s world-record £87 million (about $112 million) bid for Monaco’s outstanding 18-year-old forward  Kylian Mbappe.  L’Equipe in France claims Wenger’s club has already made an offer for the young sensation who lit up the Champions League and scored 26 goals for Monaco last season.
Further good news for Arsenal fans comes from  The Sun, which says  Mesut Ozil will be signing a new contract at the Emirates, worth £280,000-a-week (about $360,000).
But the club’s other leading player,  Alexis Sanchez, could be on his way out of north London if his fellow Chilean international Arturo Vidal has anything to do with it. In the  Evening Standard, Vidal, the Bayern Munich midfielder, is quoted as telling Sanchez to abandon Arsenal and join him at a “big team.”
After the news that  Manchester United’s pursuit of Griezmann has cooled, Mourinho has turned his attention to securing the services of Werder Bremen striker  Max Kruse, according to  Goal.com. But Everton’s  Romelu Lukaku also remains on the list of targets, the  Daily Express say, as United seeks a replacement for the injured Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
Mourinho is also said to be prepared to offer £50 million (about $64 million) for  Alexandre Lacazette , an Arsenal target a year ago who scored 37 goals last season,  The Mirror says. The 26-year-old currently plays for Lyon in Ligue 1.
Chelsea is edging closer to beating Manchester United to the signing of Monaco midfielder  Tiemoue Bakayoko , according to the  Daily Mail. The French club values Bakayoko, 22, at £43 million (about $55 million) but the report says Monaco are keen on taking Chelsea forward  Michy Batshuayi as part of the deal.
Reports on Thursday suggested Manchester City would blow out all other competition in the pursuit of Southampton’s  Virgil van Dijk, offering £50 million (about $64 million) as a transfer fee and £180,000-a-week (about $232,000) in wages. However, the  Liverpool Echo says that Jurgen Klopp’s team has not given up hope that the Dutch center-back will snub the lucrative deal to join him at Anfield. But, according to  The Sun, Southampton is looking to get £70 million for him this summer, a world-record fee for a defender.
Liverpool has also made an offer for former Chelsea winger  Mohamed Salah, according to  Gazzetta dello Sport, which has been accepted by Roma. The Italian giant has asked for a fee of £30.4 million (about $39 million).


Kevin Durant scored a game-high 38 points and Stephen Curry hit six three-pointers as the Golden State Warriors cruised to a lopsided 113-91 win in the first game of the NBA Finals on Thursday. 
The highly anticipated meeting between the defending champion Cavaliers and the top-seeded Warriors did not disappoint initially, with sensational dunks by LeBron James and Durant during a see-sawing first quarter.
But the wheels came off quickly for the visiting Cavaliers in the second half, with Durant sinking a three-pointer and Warriors center Zaza Pachulia hitting a lay-up on their way to a 10-0 run.
The final outcome was all but a formality by the start of the fourth quarter as the Warriors forged 21 points ahead. 
The Warriors, who had not played in nine days, were rusty at the outset, missing shots close to the basket and looking anxious when they had possession.
"Our first half was sloppy on the offensive end, we were missing a lot of lay-ups," said Curry.
"A little gun shy with our shots. But our defense allowed us to create some momentum until we got our flow."
But the Cavaliers hurt themselves with 20 turnovers, tying an NBA record for a playoff or Finals game.
The Warriors, meanwhile, committed just four, tying the record for the fewest in a Finals game.
The Warriors and Cavaliers are meeting in their third consecutive Finals, a matchup many predicted when the season began after Golden State signed Durant in a blockbuster move.
The Warriors won the 2015 championship but let a 3-1 lead slip last year as James's Cavaliers finally brought the Larry O'Brien trophy back to Ohio.
The Warriors know better than to relax against James and their rivals, Durant said.
"We’re playing a great team, we're playing the champs. You know they’re not going to give up at all," he said on court. 
The Warriors improved their postseason record to an unprecedented 13-0 while the Cavaliers suffered just their second loss since the playoffs began in mid-April.
"It wasn't just the third quarter, it was the whole game," James, who gave up eight turnovers, told reporters after the Cavaliers were outscored by 13 points in the period.
"It started with myself having some turnovers, especially in the first half. I pride myself on not turning the ball over and I did it too much."
When asked what was different about the Warriors compared to their two previous Finals, James was succinct. 
"K.D.," he said, referring to Durant. 
"We got to figure out how to combat that, which is going to be a tough challenge for us," he said.
The teams will meet again in Oakland on Sunday for Game Two of the best-of-seven series.


What streams may come.
Speaking at the Recode Conference in Southern California on Wednesday, Bill Simmons, the godfather of sports blogging and the podfather of sports podcasting, opined that technology companies soon will hold the rights to major sporting events. “I think it’s going to be Amazon, Netflix, Google and Facebook deciding everything,” said the CEO of The Ringer, a sports and pop culture website whose first anniversary is today (June 1). “Including what we’re wearing, in like five years.”
Related: Is ESPN crawling toward extinction?
Simmons, 47, has become a nexus of schadenfruede for sport and media writers in the past couple of years, following the failure of his HBO show, Any Given Wednesday, and his unceremonious exodus from ESPN. His petulant streak is no secret in the industry. When CNBC’s Julia Boorstin, who interviewed him at Recode, mentioned that he had been fired by ESPN, he interjected: “I was not fired! Yeah, I was not fired. I don’t know how that got started that I got fired. They decided not to renew my contract.”
Nevertheless, Simmons also has a well-deserved reputation as a visionary or, as they say in Silicon Valley, an "early adopter." He launched his sports blog, Boston Sports Guy, on an AOL account in the mid-1990s and it became the snowflake that incited the avalanche of sports blogging that has crushed traditional sports media. His podcast just celebrated its 10th anniversary, and how many media personalities can say they were doing podcasts a decade ago?
Hence, when Simmons declares that traditional broadcasters such as CBS, NBC, Fox and ABC/ESPN will one day forfeit the rights to the Super Bowl, the NBA Finals and the World Series to Silicon Valley, it is worth exploring the merits of that statement. The traditional broadcast networks are all subsidiaries of larger, monolithic corporations. NBC, for example, is an arm of General Electric and ABC/ESPN is part of Disney. Those networks are not autonomous, being beholden to higher corporate structures and budgets.
ABC/ESPN and TNT have exclusive rights to the NBA Finals through 2025, but then what?   USA TODAY SPORTS
The four tech companies that Simmons mentioned are all independent, and they are among the fastest-growing businesses on the planet. Google (a.k.a. Alphabet), Amazon and Facebook are among the top six U.S. companies in terms of market capitalization (none were in the top 10 a decade ago). All three companies have more liquid assets than General Electric or Disney (or Fox’s NewsCorp or CBS’s parent company, Viacom), and all are anxious to expand their footprints in terms of providing content. “I just think [the tech goliaths] are going to be the sports rights people because they’re going to have so much money,” Simmons said.
ABC/ESPN’s currents NFL rights package extends through 2021 at a cost of $1.9 billion per year. CBS, Fox and NBC all have rights packages with the NFL through 2022. ABC/ESPN and Turner Sports (i.e., TNT) pay the NBA a combined $2.6 billion per year in a deal that runs through 2025. By the time those contracts are up for renewal, it is anyone’s guess how much more prevalent tech companies such as Amazon, Google, etc., will have become in consumers’ lives.
Netflix, which is not even 20 years old, has seen shares of its stock soar a multiple of 32 times in the past five years alone. It is now a $70 billion company. “Look at what Netflix did with stand-up comedy,” said Simmons. “They were just like, ‘Hey, we like stand-up comedy. We’re just buying it. We’re buying everybody. We’re getting every single stand-up comedian.’ And they just did it. Eventually, they’re going to look at the NBA or the NFL and say, ‘Hey, we like the NFL. We’re just buying it.’”
Boorstin asked Simmons if he thought it was good or bad for consumers, this encroachment of tech companies using streaming services to air the most popular sporting events in the United States. “As long as it’s part of my Amazon Prime,” replied Simmons, “I don’t care.”


Manchester United’s long-drawn out flirtation with signing Antoine Griezmann has come to a sudden halt, according to reports, but the club seems to have wrapped up one signing this summer.
Griezmann, of Atletico Madrid, has a buy-out clause of £86 million ($111 million) that  Manchester United was expected to activate this summer. The 26-year-old forward has spoken out about the move himself, giving it a “six out of 10” chance of happening.
But widespread reports on Thursday, including from the BBC, suggest Griezmann is no longer a priority for  Mourinho as he aims to replace the Zlatan Ibrahimovic instead.
Ibrahimovic, the club’s top scorer this season, suffered a long-term injury in the closing weeks of the season but his contract at Old Trafford expires on June 30.
The club will now turn its attention to signing a main striker rather than a number 10, the position Griezmann holds, the report says.
At the other end of the field, however,  United looks to have signed a target of Mourinho’s in January. According to Portuguese newspaper  Record, the Premier League club will pay up to £35 million ($45 million) for Victor Lindelof, the Sweden international.
The 23-year-old center back had been linked with Spain’s top two clubs, Real Madrid and Barcelona, as well as Newcastle, which was promoted to the Premier League last month.
Lindelof signed a long-term deal at Benfica earlier in the season but that wouldn’t scupper the move to United. The transfer window officially opens on June 9.


The 2017 NBA Finals, which begin at Oracle Arena in Oakland, California, Friday, will be LeBron James’s seventh in a row.
Even during an  NBA era lacking parity—partly thanks to the talents of the likes of James, and Golden State Warriors’  Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant —32-year-old James’s consistency stands out.
On the eve of another Finals appearance, here’s how “King James” has fared since his debut a decade ago.
A 22-year-old James, in his fourth NBA season, went to the Finals for the first time. The Cavaliers, in a first-ever appearance in a NBA Finals series, ran into a brick wall in the form of the San Antonio Spurs, though. MVP Tony Parker averaged 24.5 points per game, while James could only manage 22 ppg, as the Spurs swept the series.
James wouldn’t get back to the Finals until the season of “The Decision,” when he teamed up with Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh at the Miami Heat. James had moved to South Beach to win a title but he would still have to wait for that. This time is was Dirk Nowitzki as MVP who usurped him, as the Dallas Mavericks defeated the Heat in six games. James averaged 17.8 ppg to finish third on the Heat in scoring.
James only had to wait a year for his first title. The Heat faced the Western Conference champion Oklahoma City Thunder following a classic seven-game series against the Boston Celtic in the Eastern Conference Finals. James exploded in scoring with 28.6 ppg and was crowned MVP as the Heat took the series in five games.
In a seven-game classic, James gained a measure of revenge for six years previous. He put up 25.3 ppg as the Heat defeated the Spurs four games to three, and was named MVP again. James’s game seven performance may be the finest of his career, with 37 points and 12 rebounds.
The Spurs took revenge and then some, in one of the most lopsided statistical Finals in history. Kawhi Leonard was MVP and James’s fine individual performance—28.2 ppg, leading the Heat in minutes—could not prevent a 4-1 series defeat.
After four seasons with the Heat, James returned to Cleveland and sure enough, the historically bad Cavaliers began winning again. However, they were not yet good enough to win a championship. James averaged 35.8 ppg and led both teams in points, assists and rebounds. But with Kevin Love and Kyrie Irving both missing significant chunks of the series, Cleveland lost a 2-1 lead in the series. Andre Iguodala was Finals MVP, mostly for guarding James.
For the third time in his playing days there, J ames took Cleveland to the Finals and this time brought home the title. Everything seemed lost after the Warriors took a 3-1 series lead. But James dragged the Cavaliers back from the brink to win the seven-game series, averaging 29.7 ppg as he was named Finals MVP again.


Finally, after a full week without professional basketball—ESPN was thisclose to launching another Stephen A. Smith show titled Pardon The Intermission—the NBA Finals will commence Thursday night in Oakland. For the third consecutive year, it will be the Cleveland Cavaliers facing the Golden State Warriors.
Who will win is at best an educated guess (Las Vegas likes the Dubs), but what is certain is that in this trilogy, the past is not prologue. The Warriors defeated Cleveland in six games in 2015, but the Cavaliers were without Kevin Love (dislocated shoulder) the entire series and lost Kyrie Irving (fractured kneecap) in overtime of Game 1 at Oracle Arena. He would miss the remainder of the series. Minus his two All-Star sidekicks, LeBron James would average nearly 36 points and more than 13 rebounds per game, but the Warriors won the final three games and the series.
Irving's presence in last year's NBA Finals made a huge difference for the Cavs   USA TODAY SPORTS
Last year, the situation was nearly reversed. After taking a 3-1 series lead, Golden State lost forward Draymond Green to a one-game suspension (multiple technical fouls) in Game 5, and then center Andrew Bogut to injury in Games 6 and 7. As the Warriors had done the previous year, Cleveland capitalized on the absence of two injured Golden State starters and won the final three games of the Finals.
(An aside: the NHL, NFL and Major League Baseball each have one instance of two teams meeting for the championship three consecutive years: Detroit and Montreal, 1954-1956, in hockey; Detroit and Cleveland, 1952-1954, in football; the New York Giants and Yankees, 1921-1923, in baseball. For the NBA, though, this is unprecedented.)
This year? The Warriors are undefeated in the playoffs, at 12-0, but they were trailing by 25 points at home in the second half to San Antonio in Game 1 of the Western Conference finals before the west’s LeBron James doppelganger, Spurs forward Kawhi Leonard, suffered an ankle injury. Leonard was lost for the remainder of the series. Would the Warriors be playing tonight if Leonard had not gotten hurt? No one will ever know, but probably nobody along San Antonio’s Riverwalk believes so.
Curry is pacing the Warriors this postseason with a 28.6 points per game average   USA TODAY SPORTS
Cleveland has been more mercurial than the Warriors this spring. The Cavs destroyed the Boston Celtics by 44 points in Game 2 of the Eastern Conference finals, then lost two days later after squandering a 21-point third-quarter lead. It was their only loss of the postseason, making the two teams’ combined records during these playoffs 24-1 (which, coincidentally, was Golden State’s record over the first 25 games of last season and is their record in their past 25 games).
Is there anything to glean from such overwhelming dominance by both franchises this postseason? The Warriors failed to match or even eclipse last season’s record-breaking 73-9 record, but they added Kevin Durant, one of, at worst, the NBA’s five best players. The Cavaliers also failed to win as many regular season games as they did a year ago, but for them, as with the Dubs, the playoffs thus far have been akin to Usain Bolt’s qualifying heats. These are two teams that have been waiting all spring, with the exception of a fully healthy Spurs squad, for someone to test them.
Will the acquisition of Kevin Durant give the Warriors that tiny extra edge over Cleveland?   USA TODAY SPORTS
Last June, in the closing moments of Game 7, LeBron made a career-defining block from behind on Andre Iguodala (2015 NBA Finals MVP), Irving drained the go-ahead three and Curry attempted and failed to break down the seven-footer Love off the dribble for a potential game-tying bucket. The Cavs won, 93-89.
This June? Golden State has added 2014 NBA MVP Durant, so at tipoff on Thursday seven of the past eight MVP awards (with the exception of Derrick Rose, 2011) will be represented on the court in the persons of James, Stephen Curry and Durant. It will mark the first time since 1983 that three former MVPs (Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Julius Erving and Moses Malone) will appear in the same NBA Finals. The Warriors have barely been tested these playoffs, they have superior shooting from beyond the arc and they also have home-court advantage.
Related: LeBron versus Jordan is an avocado toast argument
The pick here, however, is Cleveland. In game-, series- and even career-defining moments, they have in Irving and James two of the best closers the NBA Finals has seen. Last Christmas Day, Cleveland trailed Golden State by 14 in the fourth quarter, but came back to win. There is a sense, and it is little more than that, that the Dubs are the more proficient team but also the softer one...which, granted, is a remarkable thing to say about a club that has won 24 of its past 25 games.
This is a legacy series: two outstanding franchises with at least two future Hall of Famers per side who each have won an NBA Finals when the opponent was at less than full strength. Assuming that neither team is victimized by injury this next fortnight, this should be the series between Cleveland and Golden State that will be most vividly remembered. It’s difficult to believe that in a Finals with that much at stake, LeBron James will not succeed. Stephen Curry may be the best shooter the NBA has ever seen, but LeBron James is its toughest competitor since Michael Jordan.
Cavaliers in seven. Again.


Martina Navratilova, the 18-time tennis Grand Slam champion, has penned an open letter calling for the renaming of the Margaret Court Arena at Melbourne Park after the Australian’s “racist and homophobic” comments.
Navratilova’s letter comes after Court, a former world No.1, said she would boycott Qantas airline “where possible” due to its support of same-sex marriage. “I believe in marriage as a union between a man and a woman as stated in the Bible,” Court, 74, said in March, as quoted by  The Guardian.
On Wednesday, speaking to a Christian radio station, Court said "tennis is full of lesbians" and that she believed transgender children are the work of "the devil." 
Melbourne Park is the venue the Australian Open every January.
Navratilova opted to respond through a letter in  The Sydney Morning Herald, where she wrote: “We celebrate free speech, but that doesn't mean it is free of consequences—not punishment, but consequences.
“We should not be celebrating this kind of behaviour, this kind of philosophy. The platform people like Margaret Court use needs to be made smaller, not bigger.”
Navratilova said she had forgiven Court, who has 24 Grand Slam titles, for comments she made in 1990, when she said the Czech-American was a bad role model due to her homosexuality. But Navratilova went on to explain that she was unaware of Court’s remarks about the apartheid regime in South Africa.
“South Africa has the racial situation rather better organized than anyone else, certainly much better than the United States,” the Australian said in 1970, according to the  BBC.
“It is now clear exactly who Court is: an amazing tennis player, and a racist and a homophobe,” Navratilova wrote. “Her vitriol is not just an opinion. She is actively trying to keep LGBT people from getting equal rights (note to Court: we are human beings, too). She is demonising trans kids and trans adults everywhere.”
On Wednesday, men’s world No.1 Andy Murray also questioned Court’s views. “I don’t see why anyone has a problem with two people who love each other getting married,” he said, as quoted by  The Times.
But Murray also believes an effort to change the name of the venue should be made in the lead up to next year’s Australian Open.
Navratilova finished her letter by suggesting the venue in Melbourne be renamed as the Evonne Goolagong Arena, a 14-time Grand Slam winner of Aboriginal descent, adding: “Now there is a person we can all celebrate. On every level.”


Manchester United finds itself at the center of transfer rumors again as June begins and the opening of the summer window draws nearer.
United has rejected a huge bid from Real Madrid for goalkeeper David De Gea worth £60 million, according to  Sky Sports News.
De Gea, 26, came to United from Real’s rival Atletico Madrid in the summer of 2011 but has been frequently linked with a move to the Santiago Bernabeu stadium.
Sky claims United rejected another offer from Real this week but the  Manchester Evening News says there has been no bid and the Spain international is happy to remain at Old Trafford on a contract that runs until 2019.
Away from De Gea, Mourinho continues to work on signing a new striker. According to Italian journalist  Gianluca Di Marzio, he has whittled his options down to three targets: A.S. Monaco’s Kylian Mbappe, Real’s Alvaro Morata and the man who remains the priority, Atletico’s Antoine Griezmann.
Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp, meanwhile, is in need of a new left back. As is Pep Guardiola at Manchester City. Naturally — according to  ESPN anyway — both are interested in one of Europe’s best in the position this season, Monaco’s Benjamin Mendy. Klopp played James Milner out of position at left back for much of last season while Guardiola’s City struggled with an ageing Gael Clichy in the same position. The dynamic, attacking Mendy would improve both although City’s financial largesse, combined with the presence of Mendy’s former Monaco teammate Bernardo Silva at Etihad Stadium, may give it the edge.
If reports are to be believed, City and Liverpool are going to be duking it out all summer over defensive transfer targets.  The Times claims City is preparing a vast, £100 million offer for Southampton defender Virgil Van Dijk comprised of a £50 million transfer fee and £180,000 a week in wages, which would almost certainly be enough to end Liverpool’s interest in the center back.


Little more than a week since Jose Mourinho returned Manchester United to Europe’s top table, he has been given a warning for next season by one of the club’s most iconic figures.
Sir Alex Ferguson, who won 38 trophies in 26 years as manager at Old Trafford, says  United has a duty to entertain while playing in the Champions League.  Mourinho’s team finished sixth in the Premier League but qualified for next season’s competition by winning the  Europa League.
Ferguson, 75, says European football has changed. “The counter attack has become more prominent today; the condition of pitches is superb today; and also the protection of footballers has become more prevalent,” he told  UEFA.com. “So a lot of these things add up to what you're seeing as a far better spectacle.
“I think you have a duty and a responsibility to entertain. We have to always remember that there's a public to be entertained. In my time at United, it was ‘as long as you win.’ If it was 4-3, OK, or 5-4, OK. My last game was 5-5 (at West Brom in 2013). I couldn't ask for a better score in my last game at United.”
Although  Mourinho won three trophies—the Charity Shield, League Cup and Europa League — in his first season at Old Trafford, the style of football was widely criticized. United recorded 15 draws in 38 league matches last season, the most of any Premier League team.
“They don’t get you on the edge of your seat,” Graeme Souness said last month while working as a pundit for Sky Sports. And Mourinho’s tactics have been criticized at each of the clubs he has coached.
The Portuguese manager famously brought the phrase “parking the bus”—referring to defensive-minded football—during his first stint as Chelsea manager from 2004 through 2007, but it has also been used against him.  
When Mourinho’s Chelsea sat deep against league leader Liverpool in 2014 and then grabbed a late winner, Brendan Rodgers, then manager at Anfield, said Mourinho had “parked two busses.”
But that won’t be an option for him in the Champions League at Manchester United next season, as Ferguson continues to watch from the stands, expecting to be entertained.


For a glorious while there it seemed Groundhog Summer in the transfer window could be averted.
David De Gea didn’t play in the  Europa League final against Ajax on May 24 in Stockholm, Manchester United’s most important game of the season. Amid strong reports of heavy interest from Real Madrid, one of the world’s top three goalkeepers seemed to be finally on his way to the Spanish capital.
Or not.  The Guardian claims United has “no intention” of selling De Gea, 26, on the basis the club will not sell players it wishes to keep.
That seems logical, as does avoiding the onerous result of selling De Gea. José Mourinho would have to spend around £50 million on a replacement, who might not be quite as good as the Spanish international.
Unless De Gea rocks the good ship United—and the suggestion is he won’t do that—then United, swimming in television money and sponsorship revenue, has no need to let him go.
As in 2015, when only slow faxes prevented him from moving to Real, and in 2016, when Spanish radio station  Cadena Cope claimed Mourinho had blocked another prospective transfer to La Liga, it seems De Gea is going to stay at Old Trafford.
“It's the same thing every day, clean up your room, stand up straight, pick up your feet, take it like a man, be nice to your sister, don't mix beer and wine ever, oh yeah, don't drive on the railroad tracks,” said Bill Murray as Phil Connors in  Groundhog Day .
He might have added, dally with Real Madrid every season before you realize that Old Trafford isn’t so bad, after all.


The summer transfer window may be yet to open, but the rumor mill is already spinning.
Officially, clubs are able to buy and sell from June 9 but some deals are already done, with Bernardo Silva set to join Manchester City for £43.6 million (about $55.8 million).
Here,  Newsweek  looks at the latest rumors on who could be going where and who’s staying put:
Manchester United’s hope of signing Atletico Madrid forward Antoine Griezmann got a boost after the Frenchman told the La Liga club Tuesday that he wants to leave this summer, according to  Cadena Cope. Griezmann, 26, is expected to cost Jose Mourinho’s team a world-record sum should he join.
Reports have also linked Mourinho with a move for Paris Saint-Germain’s Blaise Matuidi, and the French midfielder said PSG has made him an offer to stay but he doesn’t know whether he will take it, according to  The Independent.
After the Arsenal board  reportedly told Arsene Wenger to be more assertive in the transfer market when he signed a new two-year contract Tuesday,  the club is being linked with a handful of players.
The London side has struck a deal with Belgian club Eupen for 19-year-old Nigerian forward Henry Onyekuru worth £6.8 million (about $8.7 million), according to the  Daily Mail. Wenger is also keen on Riyad Mahrez after the Algerian forward told Leicester City he wanted to leave, reported the  Daily Mirror, and he has his eye on AC Milan striker Carlos Bacca and Monaco’s 21-year-old midfielder Thomas Lemar.
While Diego Costa was the striker at Chelsea linked with a move away from Stamford Bridge all season, it is Michy Batshuayi who could be heading for the exit. The Belgian forward was a clear second choice to Costa at the Premier League champion this year and he is interested in a loan move to West Ham to get first-team football, according to the  Evening Standard.
After Asmir Begovic left the club Tuesday for Bournemouth, Chelsea is looking to bring in PSG’s Alphonse Areola as his replacement and reserve goalkeeper to Thibaut Courtois, according to  The Sun.
Chelsea is expected to confirm another exit in Dominic Solanke, the 19-year-old forward, who will join Liverpool for £3 million (about $3.85 million), said the  BBC. The deal will be official on July 1.
In defense, Jurgen Klopp’s Liverpool is looking to sign from fellow Premier League clubs. The  Daily Mirror reported the Anfield club is after center-back Virgil van Dijk, 25, who is valued at around £50 million ($64 million), while  The Sun said Liverpool will also look to bring Gael Clichy to Merseyside after he was released by Manchester City.


Albert Pujols is going to become the ninth man in professional baseball history to reach 600 home runs. The only questions are where, and when.
With a bomb to right field in Anaheim on Tuesday, the  Los Angeles Angels first baseman moved to 599. He’s now within sight of Sammy Sosa, eighth on the all-time list on 609.
Pujols, 37, has declined in production since he left the St Louis Cardinals for a ten-year, $240 million contract with the Angels in 2012. In a February 2016 article,  ESPN called it the worst contract in Major League Baseball,  despite 40 home runs in 2015.
But that’s the Angels’ problem. Now Pujols is within a hit of 600, it’s too tempting not to wonder where that hit is going to come.
In another season of decline for a future Hall of Famer, Pujols has seven home runs in 46 games for the Angels, or one home run every 6.57 games.
The Angels are on a homestand, with a game against the Atlanta Braves on Thursday followed by three against the Minnesota Twins on Friday, Saturday and Sunday. They have one more game against the Twins on June 6 before they go on the road, for three games against the Detroit Tigers and three against the Houston Astros.
Pujols could belt one into the top tier of Angel Stadium tomorrow, of course. Or it could happen on June 8 at Comerica Park in the Motor City. Either way, inevitably, number 600 is coming.

It started with a Nashville Predators tradition.
A fan, throwing a catfish onto the ice—a practice begun around 2003, similar to the  Red Wings’ octopus-hurling, only less historic and maybe weirder.
It’s possible, though, that no Predators fan has ever gone to the lengths of one Jacob Deveral Waddell to act it out.
With the Predators down 3-0 in the first game of their first-ever Stanley Cup Finals at PPG Paints Arena in Pittsburgh, Waddell, 36, chucked a catfish onto the rink. He was promptly escorted from the game.
 
So this dude just got kicked out of Game 1 of the Stanley Cup Final for throwing a catfish on the ice. pic.twitter.com/DzLK6l1Mv5
 

Behind the dead fish, though, lies a story of heroism. One does not simply bring a catfish to a hockey game unopposed—in an interview with  104.5 The Zone in Nashville Tuesday, Waddell explained how he had bought the fish in a market in Tennessee, sprayed it with Old Spice and put in in a cooler for the trip northeast, removed half of its spine before running it over with a truck so that it could be better hidden.
After all that, he hid it under a pair of compression shorts. He also paid $350 to watch a game he didn’t get to see finish and now, according to  Triblive.com, he has been charged by Pittsburgh police for possessing an “instrument of crime” (the catfish, in case you were wondering).
 
Here&#39;s the #catfish criminal complaint against @JacobDeveral #PENSvsPREDS #StanleyCupFinal pic.twitter.com/Z2MygrNAuE
 

The episode provoked a delightfully silly  statement from William Peduto, the mayor of Pittsburgh. "This has turned into a whale of a story. From my perch, I agree with Mayor Barry [Megan Barry, the mayor of Nashville] that we shouldn't be baited into interfering with this fish tale, but if the charges eventually make their way to a judge I hope the predatory catfish hurler who got the hook last night is simply sentenced to community service, perhaps cleaning fish at Wholey's [a famous Pittsburgh fish restaurant]."
And Waddell may have won in the end. Carrie Underwood gave him a shout-out on Twitter. Underwood is married to Predators center Mike Fisher, which given the tone of this story, seems an appropriate unintentional joke on which to end.

Albert Pujols, the Los Angeles Angels slugger, hit the 599th home run of an illustrious career on Tuesday evening to draw nearer the marks of some of Major League Baseball’s greatest players.
Pujols’ homer—a trademark swing to right field off a pitch from Bartolo Colon—came in the third inning of a 9-3 victory over the  Atlanta Braves at Angel Stadium in Anaheim.
The 37-year-old, born in Santo Domingo in the Dominican Republic, established himself as one of the game’s most-feared hitters in the early part of the 21st century with the St Louis Cardinals. He won two World Series with the franchise in 2006 and 2011.

With the hit, which came as part of a nine-run third inning that opened up the game for the Angels, Pujols draws a little closer to those famous sluggers. Only eight men have ever hit more 600 home runs, with Sammy Sosa now closest to Pujols on 609. Barry Bonds, the controversial former outfielder who played for the Pittsburgh Pirates and San Francisco Giants, leads the way on 762.


French tennis player Maxime Hamou has been kicked out of the French Open for repeatedly kissing and groping a female reporter on camera.
Related: ESPN's '100 Most Famous Athletes' list omits baseball
During a post-match interview, the 21-year-old Hamou, ranked 287th in the world, put his arm around Eurosport reporter Maly Thomas and, over the course of about 35 seconds, repeatedly kissed her as she attempted to interview him. Thomas tried to wriggle away from Hamou, but his grip on her shoulder remained firm. Toward the end of the interview, he moved his hand closer to her neck and, ultimately, across the front of her blouse before she flung it away and escaped.

The French Federation of Tennis called it a "reprehensible act."
Also reprehensible was the response from studio host Henri Leconte, a former tennis pro who laughs and claps heartily as Hamou assaults Thomas.
Though the interview came after Hamou lost in straight sets to Pablo Cuevas of Uruguay in the tournament's first round, the Open still felt the need to publicly ban the Frenchman from the rest of the tournament. “The management of the tournament has decided to revoke Maxime Hamou’s accreditation following his reprehensible behavior with a journalist yesterday,” the French Tennis Federation said in statement provided to The Telegraph.
Thomas smiles throughout the interview before throwing Hamou's arm off of her chest, but don't be mistaken: “If I hadn’t been live on air, I would have punched him," she told Huffington Post France.
Hamou on Tuesday released an apology via his Instagram account (translation via Deadspin):
After the show “Avantage Leconte,” I have to give my deepest regrets to Maly Thomas if she felt hurt or shocked by my attitude during her interview. I just lived a magnificent week here at Roland Garros as I lived my most beautiful thrills as a tennis player, and I allowed my overflow of enthusiasm to bleed clumsily toward Maly, who I know and respect sincerely. Nothing but what is written was my intention. I am at her disposition to present my apologies in person if she would like it. I again learn from my mistakes every day to become a better tennis player and a better person.
Thomas's network, Eurosport, issued a statement provided to Retuers on Tuesday. "We sincerely regret the incident that occurred during yesterday evening’s interview between Maly Thomas and Maxime Hamou. The behavior of the interviewee was highly inappropriate and we do not condone such conduct in any way. Maly is a highly respected journalist and we are pleased that a full apology is being offered."
The French Tennis Federation has said that it will continue to investigate the incident.


As obsessed as ESPN is with LaVar Ball, the world’s most obnoxious sports dad failed to make its annual “100 Most Famous Athletes on the Planet” list. Then again, no baseball or hockey player cracked ESPN’s top 100, either.
The list, released Tuesday, is headlined by Real Madrid soccer superstar Cristiano Ronaldo, whom ESPN.com dubs “The King of Social Media” with his 261 million followers on various platforms. The striking Portuguese striker is one of 38 footballers in ESPN’s top 100, by far the most of any sport. Ronaldo’s La Liga rival, F.C. Barcelona striker Lionel Messi, is third on the list.
Serena Williams is not the world's most famous female athlete, according to ESPN's list.   Jason Reed
LeBron James, second on the list, is one of 13 basketball players in ESPN’s top 100, while Phil Mickelson, at No. 5, is the top-ranked of 11 golfers. A decade of tennis players, headed by Switzerland’s Roger Federer at No. 4, appear, as do eight NFL stars, topped by New England Patriot quarterback Tom Brady at No. 20 (Houston Texan defensive end J.J. Watt is the only defensive player to make the cut).
The list, which excludes college athletes because of their amateur status, is a measure of fame—or infamy—as opposed to achievement in the past year. Tiger Woods placed 10th, 48 spaces ahead of reigning Masters champion Sergio Garcia. Mixed-martial artist Ronda Rousey, who was knocked out in the first round of her only bout in the past year, is the top-rated female—three places ahead of Serena Williams—at No. 16. (Rousey moved up seven spots from last year’s ranking.) Kawhi Leonard of the San Antonio Spurs failed to make not only the top 100 but is nowhere to be seen on the total list of 377 names considered (ESPN.com only published the top 100), a fact that must please his hype-averse coach, Gregg Popovich.

“The formula is a mix of social media popularity, Google search optics and endorsements,” says ESPN spokesman Paul Melvin. “Within that realm, you’re going to have some outliers. Mickelson, at No. 5, is an example of that because he is tilted heavily toward endorsements.”
Ichiro is the world's most famous baseball player—though not among the world's top 100 athletes—according to ESPN.   USA TODAY SPORTS
Retired athletes are not on the list, which explains the absence of Olympic swimming legend Michael Phelps, who competed at the Rio Olympics just 10 months ago, and boxer Floyd Mayweather, who will likely come out of retirement to fight MMA icon Conor McGregor (No. 25) this autumn. “Until that fight is officially set, Mayweather is technically ineligible,” says Melvin.
The most famous hockey player, according to ESPN’s Melvin, citing figures outside the top 100, is Sidney Crosby of the Pittsburgh Penguins (111). The top-rated baseball player was neither Mike Trout (155) nor Bryce Harper (158), but rather 43 year-old Japanese native Ichiro Suzuki (124), who is now in his 17th major league season. South Korean sensation Hyun Jin-Ryu, a relief pitcher with the Los Angeles Dodgers, also finished ahead of Trout and Harper, placing 152nd.
As for female athletes, the battle of the sexes remains a one-sided fight in terms of fame and endorsements. Only eight of the top 100 athletes are female, and only two of them (Williams and gymnast Simone Biles) are African-American. Twice as many Indian cricket players made the list as black female athletes.
The rankings were overseen by ESPN’s director of analytics, Ben Alamar. As for LaVar Ball, who as of late has been ubiquitous on ESPN and social media, Melvin says, “It’s interesting, because he is not an athlete. But with the potential for sales in terms of the [Big Baller] family brand, there’s a good chance [his son] Lonzo Ball could crack the top 100 next year.”


When you ask Oregon State baseball coach Pat Casey how he has led his top-ranked Beavers to an otherworldly 49-4 record this spring, or how the Corvallis-based program over which he has presided for 23 seasons is the only school north of Palo Alto to win the College World Series in the past half-century, he provides a succinct answer.
“I had the good fortune,” says Casey, “of not having anybody take care of me.”
Long before he became a Beaver, the Oregon native demonstrated the industriousness of one of nature’s engineers. While finishing up his undergrad degree at George Fox University in Newberg, Oregon, Casey played on the basketball team, coached the baseball team and worked as a janitor.
“In the seven years I was at George Fox, I earned $30,000 cumulative,” says Casey, 56, who led the Beavers to NCAA championships in 2006 and 2007. “When Oregon State offered me the job, I didn’t care if I had to ride a tricycle to get there. I was going to make it.”

The Beavers will open the NCAA baseball tournament this Friday as the top overall seed by hosting Holy Cross (23-27) at their historic Goss Stadium, which predates Fenway Park by five years (it opened in 1907). Oregon State enters the tournament on a 16-game winning streak, and they had a 23-game win streak earlier this spring. Of the 13 three-game series Oregon State has played this season, the Beavers have won all 13.
“This is where the value of short-term goals lies,” says Casey. “Of course, we want to win the College World Series, but we set a goal of winning every series this season.”
Oregon State, should it win a third national championship this June, would likely set the all-time mark for top winning percentage in a season. The Beavers’ .924 winning percentage is better than the NCAA mark set by Arizona State in 1972. (The Sun Devils finished 64-6, for a .914 average, losing to fellow Pacific-12 school Southern California in the College World Series.) No opponent has defeated Oregon State more than once. Only Mother Nature has stopped Oregon State on multiple occasions this spring, inflicting four rainouts at Goss Stadium (this Casey also presides over a Mudville nine).
“As a baseball player, I look at our record and think this is a joke,” says sophomore second baseman Cadyn Grenier. “As a member of this team, I’m really not surprised.”
While beavers are magicians with wood, Casey’s Beavers are more renowned for how they work with leather. Or at least how they operate from an earthen mound. Paced by southpaw Luke Heimlich’s 0.81 earned-run average, tops in the nation, the Beavers pitching staff leads the country in both ERA (1.84) and walks plus hits per inning pitched (0.98). Casey’s players like to credit their grounded coach, though, for the team’s success.
“Coach Casey is one of the only coaches I’ve ever met where 100 percent of what he does is for us,” says Grenier. “Earlier this year, we played at Stanford, and there were six of us whose hotel rooms were not ready. Coach was a little irritated, but he stayed down in the lobby with us until everyone had a room. He doesn’t put himself before anyone.”
Beavers second baseman Cadyn Grenier says he felt he was being recruited as much on character as on talent.   COURTESY OREGON STATE
That Casey guided the Beavers to consecutive national championships in 2006 and 2007, making them the first non-Sun Belt school to do so since Ohio State in 1966, is remarkable. That a program moored in the rain-blessed Pacific Northwest has become perennially dominant in the Pac-12 conference, which has produced five Sun Belt schools that have won 19 NCAA championships since that Buckeyes triumph a half-century ago, is borderline miraculous.
The Pac-12 is to collegiate baseball, after all, what Mexico is to tequila manufacturing, but Oregon State should be the padre-y-madre facility in Tijuana. The Beavers lack the obvious advantages of their counterparts’ sun-splashed campuses (e.g., Arizona and Arizona State, UCLA, USC, Stanford), but they still thrive. In fact, when Casey arrived in Corvallis in 1995, the Beavers and three other then-Pac-10 schools located in the Pacific Northwest were embargoed from competing in conference play.
So how did Casey overcome these obstacles? By being, in the manner of his school’s mascot, industrious.
In Casey’s third season, Oregon State finished 38-12-1 but failed to earn a wild card berth to the NCAA postseason. He knew that as long as Oregon State remained segregated in baseball, as opposed to all other sports in the Pac-10, his program was opening each season with two strikes against it. “How do you tell a kid you’re recruiting that we play in the Pac-10 but that we don’t play Stanford or USC or Arizona State?” asks Casey. “So I started rallying coaches in the north to fight for inclusion.”
Luke Heimlich's 0.81 ERA is the lowest in all of college baseball.   COURTESY OREGON STATE
Casey’s Ned Stark act did not play to universal acclaim, either above or below the California-Oregon border. “The coaches in the south were very opposed to it, and I don’t blame them,” says Casey, who in the late 1990s was earning less than $40,000 a year and traveling with his players by bus to Pullman to play Pac-10 counterpart Washington State. “Some of the coaches in the north didn’t like it either because that meant a dramatic upgrade in competition.”

In 1999, the Pac-10 eliminated the “Six-Pac” (Arizona, Arizona State, Cal, Stanford, UCLA and USC) and opened up conference play to all 10 members. The Beavers would finish below .500 in conference play every season for the next six years. In 2005, led by future Major League All-Star Jacoby Ellsbury (currently patrolling center field for the New York Yankees), Oregon State finished 46-12 and made its inaugural trip to Omaha, Nebraska, for the College World Series. In nine of the 12 years since, the Beavers have won at least two-thirds of their games.
“Everything we’ve achieved since we’ve gotten here,” Casey says without a trace of arrogance, “we’ve earned.”
The current 49-4 record, though, represents a new summit not just for the program but for all of college baseball. “I’ve never seen anything as odd as our record in 30 years of being involved in college baseball,” Casey says. “On the other hand, when you examine it game by game, I don’t think we’re doing anything crazy. We’re bold but humble.”
When the skies do clear, 110-year-old Goss Stadium, located in the heart of Oregon State's campus, is a sublime spot to watch a game.   COURTESY OREGON STATE
Humility comes easily to a man who spent seven years riding buses betwixt baseball backwaters. Casey once played 144 games in 150 days in the Texas League. The closest the former outfielder, a 10th-round pick by the San Diego Padres in 1980, got to The Show was a one-game call-up during spring training in the early 1980s.
“I was with Seattle, and they called up me and Danny Tartabull on the same day,” recalls Casey. “My first at-bat, I hit a home run off [13-year Major Leaguer] Vern Ruhle, and I thought, I’ve made it. After the game, they put me back on a bus to the minors.”
Casey glances at his past without a trace of regret but rather with appreciation and fondness for the wisdom that it allows him to pass on to his players. He smiles at memories of the early days in Corvallis, when he signed 11 consecutive one-year contracts (the Beavers finally offered him a long-term deal after he took them to the College World Series). He laughs about a recruiting budget that did not allow for hotel expenses, so that he’d change into his suit in the men’s room of a fast-food joint.
“My assistant coach and I would take turns changing into our suits during lunch, and then after the visit we might stop for a ‘coldie’ on the drive back home,” Casey says. “Those were good times.”As are these. Casey understands that he does not have the built-in advantages of fertile recruiting grounds or being located in a sexy college town or even, on far too many days on the western side of the Cascade mountains, a blue sky. He relishes the type of player who chooses his program despite those superficial disadvantages.
“It’s no secret that coaching young men gets more difficult each year as society loses its grip on reality,” says Casey, whose distinctly Irish name is accentuated by his birthdate: March 17. “But what I’ve learned is that kids haven’t changed that much, only their outside influences have. When we take the team photo each year, I ask my guys, ‘Ten years from now, do you want to be one of the guys that people point out or are you going to be happy being just another face?’”
This spring, the Beavers’ team photo is loaded with faces worth pointing out. Not the least of which is the skipper’s.


Ander Herrera will turn down a move to Barcelona and a reunion with his former coach Ernesto Valverde to remain at Manchester United, according to reports.
The 27-year-old midfielder, who starred in  Jose Mourinho’s team this season, earned a reputation at Athletic Bilbao under the  management of Valverde, who was appointed Barca boss on Monday.
According to  The Times, Valverde is keen on signing the Spanish midfielder in his first transfer window in the job to increase his options in the center of the pitch.
Together,  Herrera and Valverde helped put Bilbao back into the  Champions League in 2014, having spent 16 years outside Europe’s top club competition.
But the report says Herrera will reject an attempt from his former boss as Manchester United heads back into the Champions League next season having won the Community Shield, League Cup and Europa League.
Herrera has just one year left on his contract at Old Trafford but is likely to extend his deal this summer after proving to be a key member of  Mourinho’s team during the past season. This was reflected in his winning of the club’s player of the year award earlier in May.
He was instrumental in the Europa League final win against Ajax, after which he gained the man of the match award, and his most memorable performance of the season came when he nullified Eden Hazard in United’s 2-0 win over Chelsea in April.
Valverde will be looking to boost his Barcelona side in order to make his mark, and improve on the Spanish giant’s relatively poor showing last season, when it couldn’t beat arch rival Real Madrid to the La Liga title.


On Monday evening, Barcelona president Josep Maria Bartomeu revealed Ernesto Valverde as the new manager at the Camp Nou.
Valverde succeeds  Luis Enrique, who confirmed in March that he would be vacating the manager’s seat after three years in charge of  Barcelona.
Enrique’s team won the Copa del Rey this year but lost out to  Real Madrid in La Liga and was knocked out of the Champions League by  Juventus at the quarterfinal stage.
Valverde is charged with guiding Barca back to the top in both Spain and Europe, but how qualified is he for the position? Here,  Newsweek  takes a look at the new man at the Camp Nou:
Valverde announced last week that he would be leaving Athletic Bilbao after four years in charge at San Mames. Before that he had managed several Spanish clubs, including Valencia and Villarreal.
This was Valverde’s second stint as manager at the club. In his first, from 2003 through 2005, he saw the club qualify for the UEFA Cup, now known as the Europa League. He then led the club to its first trophy in 31 years when he returned in 2013, when Bilbao won the 2015 Spanish Cup. He did this at a club that has a strict transfer policy that prevents it from signing certain players.
Technically, it’s an unwritten rule. But it is widely known that Athletic Bilbao only signs players who were born in the Basque Country, or learned football within the region in northern Spain. This requires the likes of Valverde to promote and nurture youth players rather than looking to the transfer market.
No, Valverde was born in Viandar de la Vera, in central Spain, in 1964—but he moved to the Basque Country as a child, and it was here that he learnt his trade. He began his playing career at Deportivo Alaves and Sestao in the second tier of Spanish football in the early 1980s before moving to Espanyol in La Liga.
Valverde was a forward in his playing career, scoring 77 goals in 320 appearances at the professional level. He represented Spain just once in the first team, when he played 19 minutes of a Euro ‘92 qualifier against Iceland.  
After two years at Espanyol, Valverde moved over to Barcelona in 1988 and played at the Camp Nou for two years, where he won the Copa del Rey and a UEFA Cup Winners’ Cup. Valverde was part of a squad managed by Johan Cruyff that included the likes of Gary Lineker, Julio Salinas and Andoni Zubizarreta Urreta, but injuries limited his first-team action. He played just 22 times for the club and scored eight goals. But his impact on Cruyff was positive. In January 2007, Cruyff wrong in Spanish newspaper  La Vanguardia: “Valverde always gives fans reasons to be proud of their team.”
Valverde moved on to Athletic Bilbao in 1990 where he spent the majority of his career and where he is most linked with. He scored 44 times for Bilbao in 170 matches over six years, and then spent one season with Mallorca before retiring.
A 15-year career has seen Valverde manage in Spain for the majority of his career, with two stints at Bilbao and two years at Espanyol, as well as stints in charge at Villarreal and Valencia before being appointed at Barcelona this summer. The only club he managed outside Spain is Greece’s Olympiacos, which he managed twice, from 2008 through 2009 and 2010 through 2012. He won the league in each season with Olympiacos as well as two Greek Cups. Valverde’s other standout moment in management came when his Espanyol team lost the final of the 2006-07 UEFA Cup on penalties to Sevilla.
Valverde has an intelligent management style, with the ability to play swift football, but his arrival at the Camp Nou hasn’t been met with a great deal of excitement. This is due to his Bilbao team finishing seventh in La Liga and its meek performance in the Europa League—it was eliminated by Cypriot club Apoel Nicosia, a minnow in the European leagues.
Valverde’s task is great. Barcelona is in a transitional phase—it is far too reliant on the aging Lionel Messi, and opposition teams are not as intimidated by the red and yellow stripes as they once were. Barcelona lost the first leg of its Champions League last 16 tie with Paris Saint Germain 4-0. Though it made a miraculous comeback to make it through, it lost 3-0 to Juventus in the next round and went out. Valverde will have to strengthen the defense at the Camp Nou and ease Neymar into the main role as Messi heads toward his 30s. It is certainly the biggest job of Valverde’s life.


NBC’s affiliate station in West Palm Beach, Florida, WPTV, reported that golfer Tiger Woods was arrested on a DUI charge at 3 a.m. Eastern time on Monday morning. Woods, 41, was arrested on Military Trail South of Indian Creek Parkway in Jupiter, Florida, not far from his home on Jupiter Island. According to the station’s report, Woods was released from Palm Beach County Jail at 10:50 a.m.
Only five days ago, the 14-time majors champion announced on his website that “unequivocally, I want to play golf again.” Woods underwent his fourth back surgery in April, a spinal fusion procedure. In February, he pulled out of an event in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, after shooting a first-round 77 a week after missing the cut at the Farmer’s Open. He sat out almost all of 2016 due to lower-back problems.

Since winning the 2008 U.S. Open at age 32, Woods has not won a major and has fallen far from his lofty perch as one of sports' most iconic figures. On Thanksgiving weekend of 2009, he crashed his vehicle after a domestic dispute with his then wife, Elin. The couple has since divorced, and in the ensuing years, Woods has battled a plethora of physical setbacks related mostly to his back but also to his knee—he won that final U.S. Open on a torn ACL. 
Related: The long list of setbacks since Tiger's last major
In a 17-month span between March of 2012 and August of 2013, Woods won eight PGA Tour events and appeared to be returning to form. Further back problems have plagued him, however. He dated Olympic and World Cup downhill ski champion Lindsey Vonn for a couple of years, but the couple has since broken up.
Monday morning’s arrest is the latest shot into the rough from a once-legendary figure. Florida DUI laws stipulate a six-month loss of driver’s license for a blood-alcohol content of .08 percent or more. There is no mandatory minimum jail term.


The season may be over for Premier League clubs but in one sense, business is just beginning.
With the summer  transfer window opening for English clubs on June 9, rumors and reports are gathering pace.
A select few clubs, like  Manchester City, have started sealing deals even before the official start of the window. Bernardo Silva, the winger from A.S. Monaco, is a particularly eye-catching buy at a reported £43.6 million.
Here are the latest reports, rumors and news from May 30.
José Mourinho has a “pyramid structure” of summer transfer targets, according to the  Manchester Evening News, with several players identified for each position of need.
United manager Mourinho wants  Antoine Griezmann as his number one priority in attack. But he’s also prepared to sanction bids for Everton’s Romelu Lukaku and Andrea Belotti, should Griezmann prove too tricky to prise from Atletico Madrid.
Another of Mourinho’s reported targets,  Ivan Perisic, could end up being the rope in a tug-of-war between United and Chelsea.  Sky Sports claims Mourinho has made an opening offer of £36 million for the 28-year-old but Antonio Conte would also like a left winger to provide competition within his squad as he seeks to defend the Premier League title.
Manchester City has been the title contender most active in the transfer market so far this summer but the  Daily Mail reports on a possible outgoing transfer.  Kelechi Iheanacho  may be deemed surplus to requirements at Etihad Stadium with West Ham United interested, though City wants a buyback clause in case Iheanacho turns into a world-beating striker in east London.
Arsenal’s transfer business will surely remain shrouded in uncertainty until the future of Arsène Wenger is sorted—possibly as early as a board meeting on Tuesday. Still, that uncertainty encompasses the futures of  Mesut Ozil and  Alexis Sanchez  too and the  Daily Mirror reports Arsenal will make “one last push” at keeping them with two huge new contract offers.
Also in that  Mirror report is the claim that Arsenal will move for  Riyad Mahrez in the summer though should the Leicester City winger arrive it will surely be as a replacement for Ozil, as their skills are so similar.


Arsène Wenger is set to be offered a contract extension at Arsenal on Tuesday but will be warned by the club to be more aggressive in the transfer market, according to reports.
The Frenchman, who will enter his 22nd year as  Arsenal manager if he stays on at the Emirates Stadium, has built a reputation for not buying his  marquee signings until the final days of the window.
This has seen the club miss out on key players. Last summer,  N’Golo Kante, the PFA and FWA Player of the Year, is said to have wanted to join Arsenal but ended up starring in Chelsea’s Premier League title-winning team after signing for £30 million ($38.5 million).
Arsenal, instead, signed Granit Xhaka from Borussia Monchengladbach for £35 million ($45 million) but the Swiss struggled this season, picking up 13 yellow and three red cards.
Wenger also  reportedly had a deal wrapped up to sign Gonzalo Higuain from Real Madrid in 2013 but switched his attention to Luis Suarez at Liverpool. Arsenal didn’t end up with either player.
The club’s board is looking to avoid this trend continuing as part of a restructuring at Arsenal, and, according to the  Daily Mail, it will tell Wenger not to dither on deals this summer.
The report claims that Sandro Ramirez and Pablo Fornals, both of Malaga, are among the list of targets the club is aiming for while the summer window is open.
Wenger also has to secure the futures of Arsenal’s key players, Alexis Sanchez and Mesut Ozil, whose contracts expire at the end of next season.


Frank Deford, the longtime sports commentator for NPR and  Sports Illustrated writer, died on May 28 at the age of 78.
Deford made his last broadcast, transcribed in full below, on NPR’s  Morning Edition on May 3.
“Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, children of all ages. I always wanted to use that in a commentary. That wonderful circus introduction, ballyhooed by the splendid ringmaster. But I could just never find the ideal spot.
Of course had I, there would be some people who’d say that a circus doesn’t belong in with sports. But hey, just because there’s clowns around doesn’t disqualify certain daredevils from being certified athletes. Equestrians, tightrope walkers, and those who fly through the air with the greatest of ease.
That’s why I was so upset to learn that the grandest big top ever, Ringling Brothers Barnum & Bailey, was going out of business later this month. The greatest show on earth. And it probably was exactly that, once upon a time.
Well, by coincidence, this particular tiny show on earth that consists of me talking about sports on NPR, is also folding its tent flaps this May of 2017. Yes, this is my swansong, my farewell, my last hurrah.  Adieu,  adios,  arrivederci,  auf wiedersehen.
I’ve been delivering these little homilies since 1980. That’s 37 years, and altogether, NPR’s statisticians tell me, my bloviation total is 1,656 commentaries. And I trust you’ve hung onto every word. I have survived so long because I’ve been blessed with talented and gracious colleagues. And with a top brass who let me choose my topics every week, and then allowed me to express opinions that were not always popular. Well, someone had to stand up to the yackety-yak soccer cult.
And perhaps just as important—I’ve been blessed with you, with a broad and intelligent audience, even if large portions thereof haven’t necessarily given a hoot about sports. Nothing has pleased me so much as when someone, usually a woman, writes me or tells me that she has appreciated sports more. Because NPR allowed me to treat sports seriously, as another branch on the tree of culture.
Thank you for listening. Thank you for abiding me. And now, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, children of all ages. I bid you goodbye, and take my leave.”


Washington Nationals right fielder Bryce Harper stands 6 feet 2 inches tall and weighs 230 pounds. San Francisco Giants pitcher Hunter Strickland is 6 feet 4 and only 10 pounds lighter. On Monday, we found out what a fight between them looks like.
In the eighth inning of the  Nationals’ 3-0 victory at AT&T park, Strickland hit  Harper with a 98-mile-per-hour fastball. The reaction was more ice hockey than baseball. Harper, 24, pointed his bat at Strickland and charged toward him, throwing his helmet to the ground as he ran.
Strickland stood his ground, and the pair swung at each other before the benches cleared. Asked what he had thought when Harper began swinging, Strickland replied: “It’s go time.”
It’s kind of funny to watch, though the consequences for Harper and Strickland, a relief pitcher, could be severe.  Forbes reports both are likely to be suspended.
"You either go to first base or you go after him, and I decided to go after him," Harper said in quotes reported by  ESPN.
Harper had not faced a pitch from Strickland since the 2014 National League Division Series between the Nationals and the Giants, when Harper hammered two home runs off Strickland’s pitches.

Frank Deford, who as a journalist for Sports Illustrated was known as a master of long-form storytelling and as a regular commentator for National Public Radio brought sports to life for many listeners with only a passing interest in athletics, has died at age 78, his wife said on Monday.
Deford died suddenly on Sunday at his home in Key West, Florida, after an illness, his wife Carol Deford said by phone.
In 2012, then-President Barack Obama presented Deford a medal from the National Endowment for the Humanities, which honoured him "for transforming how we think about sports." He also was named to the National Association of Sportscasters and Sportswriters Hall of Fame.
Deford retired from NPR earlier this month after 37 years with the broadcast network.
"Nothing has pleased me so much as when someone, usually a woman, writes me or tells me that she's appreciated sports more because NPR allowed me to treat sports seriously as another branch on the tree of culture," Deford said in his final commentary.
A native of Maryland, Deford attended Princeton University and began his career as a reporter and researcher for Sports Illustrated magazine in 1962.
He excelled at long-form profiles of major sports figures, such as tennis star Jimmy Connors, college basketball coach Bobby Knight and the late professional football quarterback Johnny Unitas.
Deford was known for musing philosophically about the role of athletics in American life.
Writing in Sports Illustrated about his boyhood hero Johnny Unitas, who played for Deford's hometown Baltimore Colts in the 1950s, Deford said he wondered how people "in olden times connected back to their childhoods."
"After all, we have hooks with the past," Deford wrote. "When most of us from the 20th century reminisce about growing up, we right away remember the songs and the athletes of any particular moment. Right?"
Deford wrote more than a dozen books, including several novels such as "Bliss, Remembered" set during the 1936 Olympic Games, and the football saga "Everybody's All-American"—made into a 1988 movie starring Dennis Quaid and Jessica Lange.
In "Alex: The Life of a Child," Deford described his daughter who died at age 8 of cystic fibrosis.
Deford is survived by his wife Carol and two adult children, Christian and Scarlet.


Former world No. 1 golfer Tiger Woods said an unexpected reaction to prescribed medications was to blame for his early-morning DUI arrest near his Jupiter Island home in Florida on Monday.
Woods, who underwent surgery last week to relieve lingering back pain, was booked at 7:18 a.m. (1118 GMT) and released several hours later on his own recognizance, Palm Beach County Police said in an online report.
Woods said in a statement released by his spokesman that alcohol was not a factor in his arrest but apologized and added that he took full responsibility.
"I want the public to know that alcohol was not involved," he said.
"What happened was an unexpected reaction to prescribed medications. I didn’t realize the mix of medications had affected me so strongly.
"I would like to apologize with all my heart to my family, friends and the fans. I expect more from myself, too."
Woods, who is second on the all-time list with 14 major titles, said he cooperated with police and wanted to thank the Jupiter Police Department and the Palm Beach County Sheriff's office for their professionalism.
"I will do everything in my power to ensure this never happens again," he added.
The incident occurred less than a week after Woods expressed optimism about his future following back surgery, saying on his website that he experienced "instant relief" and had not "felt this good in years."
Woods has previously made headlines away from the golf course. His private life unraveled in late 2009 over allegations about affairs with several women and ultimately led to the end of his marriage.
Those allegations followed a bizarre early morning car accident outside his Florida home that rapidly ballooned into a fully-fledged sex scandal which turned his previously unblemished life and career upside down.
The scandal ultimately cost Woods a number of lucrative endorsement deals, while other sponsors shifted away from using him in marketing but did not end their contracts with him.
Woods, whose current sponsors include Nike, Bridgestone, Hero, Kowa, Upper Deck, and Monster Energy was ranked 12th on Forbes' list of the highest-paid athletes in 2016, with total earnings of $45.3 million, despite missing much of the year recovering from back surgery.
A 79-time winner on the PGA Tour who was world No. 1 for a record 683 weeks, Woods lost form in recent years due to injuries and the mastering of a new swing while his ranking has plummeted to 876 after his long spell on the sidelines.
He has competed in only 19 events on the PGA Tour since the end of 2013, recording just one top-10 during that period along with seven missed cuts and three withdrawals.


On Thursday night, in the 212th postseason game of his NBA career, LeBron James scored 35 points as the Cleveland Cavaliers eliminated the Boston Celtics from the playoffs. The win means that for the seventh consecutive year, James is headed to the NBA Finals. His point total means that by a margin of 5,995 to 5,987, King James has passed Michael Jordan as the all-time leading scorer in the NBA postseason.
James’s latest milestone provided the overly disputatious debate-embracers, aka mass debaters, with another opportunity for verbal assault. Is James, he of three NBA championships and four Most Valuable Player awards, a greater all-time great than Jordan, who earned six rings while winning five MVP honors? Why do such arguments exist? Because humans have an innate need to rank things and/or include slideshows. Even the Son of Man was not immune to this predilection: “So now faith, hope and love abide, these three,” said Jesus, “but the greatest of these is love [I Corinthians 13:13].”
(Note that’s a lowercase “l,” though Kevin Love has had a magnificent postseason thus far.)
In his final seven seasons with the Bulls, Jordan's teams were 25-1 in postseason series.   Yuri Gripas
Could Batman take Spider-Man in a no-webs-barred fight? We’ll never know: different comic universes. Was Casanova more skilled in the romantic arts than DiCaprio? It’s an unfair question, as Victoria’s Secret did not exist in the 18th century. Who would win in a fight between Floyd Mayweather and Conor McGregor? Again, we’ll never know, bec—what’s that, you say? They’re going to step into the ring this autumn? OK, scratch that one.
The Jordan vs. James debate is not really a referendum on which one of these legends is superior, though. It’s an avocado toast argument: your era versus mine. A few weeks ago, Tim Gurner, a 35-year-old Australian developer, admonished millennials for their dissolute spending habits. “When I was trying to buy my first home,” said Gurner, whose fortune is estimated at $464 million, “I wasn't buying smashed avocados for 19 bucks and four coffees at $4 each.”
Of course, a dozen years ago, Gurner probably did not graduate college as deeply in debt as today’s grads do, but why ruin a pithy avocado toast metaphor? Still, MJ vs. LeBron is basically sports fans (mostly esteem-challenged adult males) sticking up for their era, which by the transitive property is them sticking up for themselves. One can imagine fathers and sons in the 1940s tossing flaming emojis at one another as to which Roosevelt was the superior president. (“Who won World War II?” countered with “Whose face is on Mount Rushmore?!?”)
At 6'9" and 260 pounds, James has an athleticism never been seen before in the NBA.   USA TODAY SPORTS
It’s no coincidence that a majority of the pro-Jordan camp, this writer included, were born before 1980 and that the far greater swell of those born after 1980 lobby for LeBron (of course, this is an unofficial observation, completely unsubstantiated by a Nate Silver poll, so its validity is most likely to be dismissed by anyone who thinks of “war” as a baseball stat as opposed to the last resort in international disputes).
Related: Mission completed, will LeBron leave Cleveland?
Anyway, even though Jordan retired in 2003, roughly six months before James made his NBA debut, there exists an insatiable appetite on talk shows and online to determine which player is superior. The fact that Wilt Chamberlain’s name never appears in these conversations, even though he is the league’s all-time leader in rebounds per game and is second only to Jordan in points per game (they are the only two players to eclipse 30 points per game), is a product of two factors: 1) many people participating in these arguments never saw him play (Big Dipper truthers) and 2) as a dominant center, he played a position to which none of these arbiters of hoops prowess can relate. (A third potential reason is there is the nagging suspicion that he may have bedded their mother, grandmother or great aunt.)

Let’s eliminate Chamberlain and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Magic Johnson and Bill Russell and George Mikan and even Kobe Bryant from this debate, if only to allow ourselves a chance to focus. Here is a classic blow-for-blow between MJ and King James supporters:
LBJ: “LeBron just broke Jordan’s playoff career scoring record.”
MJ: “Yeah, but it took him 33 more games [212 to 179] to do it.”
LBJ: “Sure, but Jordan took 118 more shots overall [4,497 to 4,379]. Jordan may have a higher playoff scoring average [33.4 to 28.3], but he also took nearly five more shots per game than 'Bron. He was a chucker!”
MJ: “The Decision!”
LBJ: “Birmingham Barons!”
MJ: “Temecula!”
LBJ: “Now why you do you need to drag Kobe into this?!?”
Without running through every last statistical comparison (e.g., Jordan ranks first all-time in playoff Player Efficiency Rating, while James is third, behind Mikan), it seems reasonable to say that James is a more dominant physical specimen whose teams would never have made one of the seven NBA Finals without him. Jordan was a superior one-on-one scorer as well as—and this may be the defining difference—the ultimate closer in any sport. In defining-moment time, no one, with the possible exception of baseball’s David Ortiz, ever had a higher rate of success over a prolonged period of time.
Chamberlain would have had a few thoughts on this debate.   Jeff Taylor
James’s block of Andre Iguodala in Game 7 of last June’s NBA Finals was his postseason career highlight. It helped erase the missed three-pointer in Game 6 of the 2013 NBA Finals (only Ray Allen’s buzzer beater following the errant shot kept the Miami Heat from losing that series to the San Antonio Spurs), but it was also the paragon of his virtues: a superhuman athletic feat that did not require James to drain a do-or-die shot.
Jordan played in six NBA Finals and not only never lost one, his Bulls were never even taken to Game 7. James has already played in more NBA Finals, and when his career ends he will likely have surpassed Jordan in all total individual stats, if not per-game figures. He may even win as many NBA championships and MVPs as Jordan did. There is no winner in this debate: There are only losers who attempt to tear down the player not of their era in an attempt to promote their own.
Now shut up and finish your avocado toast.


Has Wayne Rooney played his last game for Manchester United?
Rooney says he has “  more or less decided ” his future and  Sky Sports claims he’s expected to leave  Old Trafford this summer.
United’s record goalscorer, Rooney has also been dropped from the England squad for the internationals against Scotland and France in June by manager Gareth Southgate.
With the end of his United career likely near, here are Rooney’s best, and worst, moments in a United shirt.
The debut
Rooney announced himself on the elite stage of European football in a thunderous manner. Against Fenerbahce in the Champions League he sent Old Trafford into raptures with three exceptional finishes. The first was a left-footed piledriver, the second a daisy-cutter from outside the penalty area. The hattrick was completed with a free-kick that arced unstoppably past Rustu Recber.

The Header, 2010 League Cup final
The apogee of Rooney’s finest goalscoring season. Aston Villa had taken an early lead at Wembley before Michael Owen equalized. Rooney came on just before halftime to replace the injured Owen and made the decisive intervention. In the 74th minute, he arched his back to meet an Antonio Valencia cross, producing enough power to send the ball beyond Brad Friedel in the Villa goal.

The overhead kick
Rooney later described his overhead kick against Manchester City as the “most important” goal of his career. It may also be the most beautiful. Luis Nani’s cross was no more than adequate until Rooney leapt sideways, contorting his body and sending one of the sweetest shinned finishes of all time past Joe Hart, whose only movement was to watch the ball disappearing into the back of his net.

The 2008 Champions League
Rooney didn’t score or assist in the 2008 Champions League final against Chelsea, and he was taken off before the end of extra time for Nani so he didn’t even get to take a penalty. That game is remembered for John Terry’s slip in the shootout, and his tears in the rain. But it may be, too, one of the best examples of Rooney’s team-first ethos. In a United team built around Cristiano Ronaldo, with Carlos Tevez as second violin, Rooney performed a defensive role on the left wing without complaint. It brought him his only Champions League.
The contract wrangles
Rooney’s legacy with Manchester United’s supporters is tricky to define, partly due to perceived disloyalty in the past. In October 2010 he came  perilously close to making what would have been one of the most rancorous transfers of all time, crossing Manchester from United to City. In the end he stayed but there may be the sense that for all his goals, Rooney has held United to ransom at times. He signed a new  £300,000-a-week deal with the club in February 2014; such sums require elevated performances and since then Rooney has not delivered consistently.
The 2011 Champions League final
Rooney scored a fine individual goal, and was one of the few United players to emerge in credit from a chastening evening at Wembley Stadium. Barcelona, spearheaded by a player Rooney might once have expected to rank alongside in Lionel Messi, ran around and over United in a 3-1 victory that signalled the beginning of the end of the epic Sir Alex Ferguson era.

The Europa League final
A bittersweet evening in Stockholm for Rooney. If this proves his final game then it will have been a more elegant exit than might have been expected. Brought on by Jose Mourinho in the last four minutes to preserve United’s 2-0 lead — and yes, perhaps, to give him a suitable send-off — Rooney put in one crunching tackle before the final whistle. United’s record goalscorer may have bowed out with a trophy, at least.


Saturday’s FA Cup final at Wembley Stadium represents two managers and clubs in very different positions.
Chelsea boss Antonio Conte has just won the domestic title and is on the verge of becoming the first manager in his first year to win a Premier League and  FA Cup double. Arsene Wenger, meanwhile, is looking to the  FA Cup as a consolation after Arsenal failed to qualify for the Champions League for the first time in 19 years.
Conte and  Wenger have faced the media to talk about their respective clubs’ seasons, their chances in Saturday’s final, summer transfers, plus security at Wembley following the Manchester attacks. Here,  Newsweek  picks out the key topics the two men have been discussing.
On injuries
Wenger: “Gabriel is out for 6-8 weeks. We had a scare about his cruciate but it’s medial. He avoids surgery.
“Alexis Sanchez is OK, Oxlade-Chamberlain is in contention for final. [Shkodran] Mustafi is still sick and hasn’t trained yet.”
Conte:  “Everyone is good.
“In a final it's not important to miss one, two players. It's important to play with the right hunger, will, desire."
On Saturday’s final
Wenger:  “I just want to win the cup. The team has addressed the situation on the sporting side and that would be a good crowning of the last two months. The players really want to win something. If I have some benefit on top of that too it’s OK.”
Conte: “It's important to keep the right concentration. In this aspect, we start as underdogs because we face a team that lost Champions League football.
“To play at Wembley is a fantastic experience for me and my players, above all if the stadium is full. We have to try to put our best."
On their futures
Wenger: “I do not know if it will be my last match at Arsenal—but it will not be my last match whatever happens because I will stay in football.”
Conte: "I don't trust that tomorrow will be the last game for Arsene.
“For sure. When you stay in the same team for such a long time, we must consider him one of the best.
“I have two years contract with the club. Then if they give me possibility to stay, I'm available to do this.”
On qualifying for the Champions League. Or not…
Wenger: “It’s not only about money. We are in a much better position. I guided this club for years with very limited resources and we had to sell our best players. Some clubs are stronger financially. We have a strong enough basic squad to compete at top level.”
Conte: “Only this year Arsenal missed out on the CL. For 19 years they played in this competition and this shows his [Wenger’s] work.”
On the attacks in Manchester
Wenger: “I was in Paris in November for the attacks. It’s a huge shock and our solidarity and compassion is with the city of Manchester.”
Conte:  “Before we start the press conference, we don't forget what happened in Manchester. We are very close to the people who died.”
On security at Wembley
Wenger:  “Usually when you are involved you don’t realise what is happening all around, we are in a bubble and isolated from all that but you want of course the best level of security.”
Conte:  “This situation creates difficulty in your mind, but if we think we are always in danger, we are dead before we die.”
On the summer transfer window
Wenger:  “[We are] not braced to lose players. We have nobody at the end of contracts. That will be completely our decision.
“I believe we have a big job to do in the summer. We want to keep players like Alexis and all the speculation can happen.”
Conte:  “We have to finish this season, but we’ve started to work for next season. We have the same point of view [Chelsea and Conte].
“For sure, we’ll try to strengthen our squad because we have to face an important competition in the Champions League.”


Formula One’s finest will line up on the grid in the streets of Monaco on Sunday for the most highly anticipated race of the season.
The championship has been held since 1929 at the Circuit de Monaco in the south of France. It is considered the hardest course to overtake because of its narrow streets.
Championship leader  Sebastian Vettel of Ferrari finished fastest in practice on Thursday, while his closest rival,  Lewis Hamilton of Mercedes, ended the session in eighth place.
Here,  Newsweek  looks at how the contenders for the top of the podium got on in last year’s race.
Ferrari’s resurgence this season should see Vettel threaten to improve on the fourth-place finish he had last year. In Monaco, qualifying is vital for a good starting position on the grid because of the narrow track around the streets. The car failed to deliver for the German, who started and finished the race in fourth and was unable to thwart Sergio Perez’s Force India, which finished third. The four-time world champion will expect to start at the front of the grid after proving fastest in practice on Thursday.
The Monaco Grand Prix tends to attract celebrities, and 2016 was no different. When  Hamilton climbed past teammate and championship rival Nico Rosberg (the eventual world champion) and Daniel Ricciardo to finish first, he was met at the podium by pop star Justin Bieber, and the two men shared champagne. Hamilton had capitalized on Ricciardo of Red Bull after a slow pit stop and defended his position for 45 laps to win his first race of the season and reignite a title charge with Rosberg. But the Briton will have to improve this weekend after being eighth-fastest in practice.
Bottas’ chances of a podium finish in Monaco have increased dramatically from last year, after he traded Williams for Mercedes. Bottas started 10th on the grid and dropped to 11th after being overtaken by then-teammate Felipe Massa. Despite being in the better car, the Finnish driver was 10th fastest in practice on Thursday, 0.025 seconds slower than Hamilton.
Second in the championship before the race in Monaco last year,  Raikkonen was one of the favorites to take the checkered flag. But while his teammate Vettel had a frustrating day, Raikkonen’s was awful. The Finnish driver, who is fourth in the standing this year, crashed into the walls at the hairpin in Monaco and had to retire early despite trying to drive on with his front wing scraping along the street. On Thursday, Raikkonen was third-fastest in practice ahead of Saturday’s qualifying.
Despite finishing third last year, Ricciardo left the racetrack furious with his team. The Australian had started the race in pole position and at one point built up a lead of 13.1 seconds on Nico Rosberg. Mercedes ordered Rosberg to allow his teammate Hamilton to pass him and put the pressure on the  Red Bull driver. Hamilton could only take two seconds off Ricciardo, but then the Australian was called into the pit lane by Red Bull—and the team didn’t have the tires ready. Hamilton passed Ricciardo as he exited the pits. “Nothing you could say would make that any better. Save it,” Ricciardo said over the team radio.
Just two weeks after Max Verstappen’s dream start at Red Bull by winning the Spanish Grand Prix, the teenage driver crashed heavily into the walls. It was a reminder to the Formula One world that although Verstappen’s talent was clear, he was far from a finished product. This week, the 19-year-old finished sixth in practice, the same position he holds in the driver standings.


LeBron James, the Cleveland Cavaliers small forward, broke a long-standing NBA record Wednesday when he scored his 5,989th career playoff point.
With a three-pointer in the third quarter of Game 5 of the Eastern Conference Finals at TD Garden,  James passed  Michael Jordan’s total of 5987.
Jordan famously set his mark with the final shot of his postseason career, a jump shot that gave the Chicago Bulls victory over Utah Jazz with 5.2 seconds remaining of Game Six of the NBA Finals in Salt Lake City on June 14, 1998.
Take a look at both shots below—James’s is at two minutes, 37 seconds. The 13-times All Star will appear in his seventh consecutive NBA Finals, and his third successive against Golden State Warriors, after his 35 points powered the Cavaliers past the Boston Celtics 135-102 in Game 5 to take the series 4-1.




Antonio Conte will walk out at Wembley Stadium on Saturday afternoon aiming to become the first manager to win a Premier League and FA Cup double in his first season in English football.
His  Chelsea team stormed to the domestic title, winning 30 of a possible 38 games that is the second most in the  Premier League. Conte did so with a constant core to his starting lineup.
But, ahead of the FA Cup final against  Ars è ne Wenger’s Arsenal, he has decisions to make. Here,  Newsweek  looks at how the Italian may put out his team.
Thibaut Courtois will be one of the first names on Conte’s team sheet. The Belgian goalkeeper featured in all but two of the matches in Chelsea’s title-winning campaign, with Asmir Begovic deputizing due to a sprained ankle. Courtois picked up the Golden Glove award after keeping 16 clean sheets this season.
Conte got sentimentality out of the way in Chelsea’s final game of the Premier League season. Club captain  John Terry started the game against Sunderland but was substituted after 26 minutes, and given a guard of honor in what was his farewell from the club he has been part of for 22 years. So, the Italian can stick with his trusted 3-4-3: David Luiz at the center of a back-three with Cesar Azpilicueta and Gary Cahill either side of him. In the wing back positions, Victor Moses will finish the season in his new position, having been Conte’s most miraculous work at Chelsea, and Marcos Alonso on the left.

Here, Conte has his biggest decision to make. Does he look to go on the attack by starting former Arsenal midfielder Cesc Fabregas, who has been a key member of the Chelsea team this season despite starting much of the campaign on the bench? Or, does he opt for conservatism in the shape of the imposing and powerful screen of Nemanja Matic? Double Player of the Year winner N’Golo Kante is certain to start against a team that could — and should — have signed him last summer.
With 21 goals this season, Diego Costa will surely start for Chelsea, right? Possibly not. The last time Conte sat in the dugout at Wembley Stadium, he had Costa sat behind him on the substitutes’ bench. The Italian chose Michy Batshuayi for the FA Cup semifinal against Tottenham, and Chelsea advanced to the final. Since then, the 23-year-old Belgian has scored four times in the last three games, giving his manager a decision to make ahead of Saturday.
Eden Hazard will likely start on the left side of attack, but Conte has switched between options on the right side throughout the season. He has preferred the Spaniard Pedro, who has made 42 appearances but Brazilian Willian has also featured 40 times, most of which came from the bench.


With a Champions League campaign to come next season, Manchester United will target quality over quantity in its summer transfer dealings.
That’s according to a  BBC report that claims manager  Jose Mourinho will make “three or four” summer signings including a world-class striker, as he attempts to make  United a viable challenger for the Premier League title once again.
Here’s how United could look next season if Mourinho spends the reported £200 million available to him.
Goalkeeper
Mourinho would like  Jan Oblak  to replace  David De Gea if the Spaniard leaves for Real Madrid but Paris Saint-Germain could scupper his plans with an offer of £52 million to blow United out of the water.  Kasper Schmeichel,  of Leicester City, may be a more realistic option that would allow Mourinho to spend some of the De Gea fee on other areas of his squad.
Defense
Antonio Valencia will remain the first-choice right back but it’s next to him that things get interesting. According to the BBC, Mourinho would like  Michael Keane  of Burnley to partner  Eric Bailly  at center back. He also needs a left back amid uncertainty around  Luke Shaw  but may have been priced out of a move for A.S. Monaco’s  Benjamin Mendy .
Midfield
United’s midfield lacks balance when  Paul Pogba  and  Marouane Fellaini  play ahead of  Ander Herrera .  Michael Carrick remains a technically gifted footballer but lacks the energy to make up for Pogba’s forays forward. Mourinho needs a battler and a runner to provide a defensive screen alongside Herrera so a  reported link with Paris Saint-Germain’s elegant, dynamic midfielder  Blaise Matuidi  is intriguing.
Attack
Antoine Griezmann  rates his chance of a move to Old Trafford this summer at a platry “six out of ten” but if he did come where would he play? The France international has turned himself into a deep-lying striker for Atletico Madrid in the past two seasons so perhaps Mourinho could bring in Griezmann  and  Andrea Belotti, a traditional No. 9 who could lead the line. The prolific Torino striker continues to be linked with a move to Manchester.  Anthony Martial, Marcus Rashford, Juan Mata  and  Jesse Lingard provide options for the left flank of a 4-3-3 formation.
Manchester United’s possible starting lineup, 2017-18:  Kasper Schmeichel-Antonio Valencia, Michael Keane, Eric Bailly, Luke Shaw-Ander Herrera, Blaise Matuidi-Paul Pogba-Anthony Martial, Andrea Belotti, Antoine Griezmann.


Cleveland forward LeBron James moved past Hall of Famer Michael Jordan as the leading scorer in NBA playoff history on his way to helping the Cavaliers ease into a third successive NBA Finals series on Thursday.
James needed 28 points to surpass Jordan (5,987 points), as he entered Game Five of the Eastern Conference Finals against the Boston Celtics and reached the milestone in style late in the third quarter with a three-point jump shot.
James celebrated the record by raising his right index finger to signal No. 1, but quickly retreated to the backcourt to defend as the game continued.
The three-pointer put the Cavaliers up by 32 points.
James promptly knocked down two more three-pointers before the end of the third period.
With victory in the bag, he sat out the fourth quarter as the Cavaliers routed the Celtics 135-102 to clinch the best-of-seven series 4-1, and set up a third successive championship series against the Golden State Warriors.
The 32-year-old James, who is seeking a fourth NBA title, took 212 post-season games to surpass Jordan, a six-time champion who played 179 playoff games.
James said he was honored to pass Jordan, his boyhood idol.
"I think first of all I wear the number (23) because of Mike," he told reporters after finishing the game with 35 points to take his total to 5,995 points.
"I think I fell in love with the game because of Mike, but when you're growing up and seeing Michael Jordan it's almost like a god, so I never did believe I could be Mike.
"The biggest thing for me sitting here after breaking the all-time scoring record in playoff history, is I did it just being me.
"I don't have to score to make an impact on a game and that was my mindset when I started playing, if I'm not scoring how can I still make an impact on the game?
"It's carried me to this point now and it's going to carry me for the rest of my career because scoring is not No. 1 on my agenda."


(Reuters) - It’s the ninth time he’s designed the Olympic downhill ski course, but Bernhard Russi will still feel his nerves tauten when racing gets under way in South Korea next month.
The 69-year-old Swiss knows better than most the excitement  of competing at the highest level. He won the Olympic title in 1972 and was narrowly beaten by Austria’s Franz Klammer four years later - the closest any men’s downhill champion has come to making a successful defense of his crown.
Further playing on his nerves, though, is the knowledge of the extreme risks faced by the men and women trying to conquer the course he has set.
“Listen, I used to be a downhiller myself. This will never go away,” Russi told Reuters. “I will always be nervous because somewhere I am always also a little bit afraid, because I know too good that bad things can happen every moment, every time, every day.”
The run-up to these Olympics has highlighted that danger, with the deaths of Frenchman David Poisson and German teenager Max Burkhart in the space of just several weeks in November and December.
While Russi sees the timing as a tragic coincidence, the risk inherent in the sport is a constant.
As he talks about the job of designing courses, it’s clear he sees one of his most vital roles as building in a safety margin for the athletes at the same time as guaranteeing a thrilling spectacle.
“I think in a good downhill I need at least three good jumps. I have to count that the jumps are probably 50 meters long, so I have to be careful that the landing zone is probably 70, 80 meters,” he said.
“If I calculate that with the speed, and the edge and the steepness the racers will jump 50 meters, I have to give them an additional space of 10 to 20 meters for safely landing in case somebody misses the jump completely - then instead of jumping 45 meters he will fly for 70, and I have to make sure that if he makes this mistake he’s not landing on the flat.”
The complexity of the course designer’s task varies hugely from one Olympics to the next, depending on whether there is existing ski infrastructure on the mountain.
The Jeongseon site in South Korea is one of several where Russi has started from zero - when he first went there in 2001, there was “nothing at all. There was a forest road until maybe half-way up and from there nothing, not even a cat walk.”
It was after the Koreans were finally awarded the Games in 2011, at their third attempt, that the Swiss set to work. Since then, he estimates he has visited about 30 times.
The first step is to study the maps, assessing the contours and judging the steepness of the various possible descents.    The second is to get his hiking boots on.
“I always say I walk the mountain in order to be able to listen to what the mountain is telling me... Especially in this case, I felt that here is a mountain which has a lot of changing terrains.”
Through his exploration, Russi gets to know the steep and flatter portions, discover the edges and ridges.
“After I know that, I try to build up the story of the mountain. Is it a wild one, or is it a more technical one, or is it more speed or is it more air?”
Sometimes he needs to modify the terrain, for example by filling in a hole or moving some earth to create an adequate landing zone.
But generally he aims to touch the mountain as little as possible. He’s proud that for these Olympics, in the interest of sustainability, agreement was reached to build a single downhill course for men and women - something that hasn’t been done before, but will be repeated when China hosts the Games in 2022.
After years of work, the time comes to test the course with the world’s best skiers. Norway’s Kjetil Jansrud won a men’s World Cup downhill here in 2016, and Italy’s Sofia Goggia pipped American Lindsey Vonn in a women’s race last March - victories that should boost their confidence heading into the Games.
But the course will include some new tweaks for the Olympics.
“It has been tested very well but after the test there are always some small changes in course-setting and I think we can add a little bit of difficulty towards the Olympics - so I would say that the course will be more difficult than in 2016,” said Russi.
“It’s going to be a very challenging downhill, a very difficult downhill, a very attractive downhill.”
If he’s done his job well, he will have set the stage next month - as he has so many times before - for what many see as the purest, most thrilling form of winter sports competition.
“You have the top of the mountain, you have the bottom of the mountain, and in between - that’s the challenge,” he said.
“The downhill is the mountain and the man.”


LONDON (Reuters) - Most of the top Alpine skiers have grown up on snow, which is something of a disadvantage for those whose countries see little of the stuff.
But that does not mean all of those ‘outsiders’ have no chance of success.
“We’re always going to be behind the Austrians, French or whatever because they were on these mountains when they were four years old,” says Britain’s leading Alpine skier Dave Ryding.
“We don’t learn the terrain, the snow, and you have to refine the skill of skiing on snow,” the 31-year-old, who learnt to ski on dry slopes around England and Wales, told Reuters in an interview.
And yet Ryding finished second in the Kitzbuehel World Cup slalom last January, the best finish by a Briton in 35 years, and led the first leg of the season opener in Levi, Finland, in November before missing a gate in the second run.
He was sixth in the Madonna di Campiglio slalom in December and fourth in a parallel slalom city event in Oslo on New Year’s Day.
“I always believed I can catch them up, eventually,” said the veteran of two Olympics.
Talk of a level playing field, even metaphorically, sits ill with a sport whose stars race down steep and icy pistes, over bumps and jumps and through the tight twists and turns of a rutted slalom slope.
The Austrians, Swiss and other ‘snow powers’ receive an avalanche of funding for the national sport, along with world class training facilities, while those without mountains on their doorstep look on enviously.
The Olympic men’s downhill, the sport’s blue riband event, has only ever been won by skiers from Alpine nations or the United States.
The World Cup has been hosted in 25 countries, from Australia to Argentina, but the only ones from outside that group to have won an Olympic Alpine medal are Luxembourg and Liechtenstein.
Luxembourg features on the list only because Austrian Marc Girardelli, who went on to become a five times overall World Cup champion, fell out with his national federation as a teenager and found another.
Ryding first trained on snow at 12, after starting on dry slopes, and moved to Austria at 18 to improve his technique. It has not been easy but his determination is paying off.
“They have it cushy,” said the Briton of some of his Austrian rivals.
He recognized, however, that they were also more likely to suffer burnout from the pressure of competing from a much younger age.
Ryding is now well-funded, compared to previous British athletes, and has shown he can compete with the best. He has his own coach, service man, physio and assistant but it was not always thus.
“In the past, say three years ago, it was literally me and my coach and I was doing my own skis, I was doing everything myself so that was also very hard,” he said.
”Back then it was costing me personally 15-20,000 (euros)  ($23,719.78) a year... but my whole team budget back then was less than 100,000.
“The Austrian slalom team, their budget will be around six million. That’s just for their season.”
Marcel Hirscher, the Austrian who has been overall World Cup champion for the past six seasons and who beat Ryding in that Kitzbuehel slalom, can count on far greater support and resources.
Ski maker Atomic, who employ Hirscher’s brother, will have a team of their own experts working with team coaches to ensure the equipment meets his every requirement.
The same goes for other top medal contenders on the World Cup circuit.
Team GB’s Pyeongchang Chef de Mission Mike Hay pointed to Norway, also an Alpine force to be reckoned with, as another country making sure their athletes have every possible advantage.
“They’re like a Formula One team,” he said of their Nordic skiing investment. “They pull up to World Cup events with massive double-decker buses all fitted out for their wax techs below.”
Yet Ryding’s results have brought new respect from the established powers, more used to non-Alpine no-hopers turning up as colorful also-rans, as well as more than a few questions.
“When I‘m sitting down at the chef de missions seminar a year out before the Games, the Swiss and Austrian guys around the table are going ‘What are you guys doing there to have somebody coming up and taking a podium?',” said Hay.
“We’re a lot more professional than we used to be, when we turned up in a battered old car having driven 250km or more from the last race overnight.”

ALTENMARKT, Austria (Reuters) - It is not just American hopes that will be riding on the performance of Mikaela Shiffrin when the world’s top woman alpine skier takes to the slopes at the Winter Olympics in South Korea next month.
Half a world away in the small Austrian town of Altenmarkt, the marketing and tech teams at ski manufacturer Atomic will be closely watching the medal count in Pyeongchang, the culmination of about 18 months of internal company planning.
Of 900 staff based at the company south of Salzburg, 38 are part of a team of international specialists, whose job is to develop ever-sleeker and more manoeuvrable skis for everything from racing to backcountry touring.
Whereas in the early 1990s design was revolutionised by switching from long, straight racing skis to a side-cut ‘parabolic’ shape, and later shifts focused on the camber, or arch, of the ski, the trend in recent years has been towards more advanced materials such as titanium.
Atomic General Manager Wolfgang Mayrhofer said the thinner, less dense materials, including lighter wood cores, and the deeper sidecuts permitted under new giant slalom rules have made a big difference to the skis.
“The skis are easier to turn,” said Austria’s Marcel Hirscher, the six-times overall World Cup champion who is bidding for his first Olympic gold medal in Pyeongchang.
”But now with the new materials they can ski different lines, they keep the same stability and rigidity but they are much more flexible, much more dampening.
“So it’s big progress since the Sochi days, since the last Olympics.”
In the speed events of downhill and super-G there has been no fundamental change to ski design in the past 10 years, according to Matt Humphreys, winter sports boss at HEAD UK, but new materials have changed their composition.
Austria-based HEAD, whose skis are used by Olympic champions Lindsey Vonn, Ted Ligety, Kjetil Jansrud and Aksel Lund Svindal, have said it is the only manufacturer to incorporate graphene, a super-thin, super-strong form of carbon that was isolated by scientists only in 2004.
The point is not to make racing skis lighter, as a heavier ski provides more stability for a downhill racer hitting speeds around 90 miles/hour (145 km/h) but to improve the flexibility and the distribution of power.
“With us using graphene, we can get the flex pattern exactly how we want it to be ... the more we put in, the stiffer and stronger the ski becomes,” said Humphreys.
That cutting edge design does not end with the ski.
Minute, detailed effort goes into the fit and comfort of boots as well as their ‘canting’ - the slight inward- or outward-tilting angle of the shoe that is tailored to match the angle of the skier’s knees.
“Where we try and get ahead of the game is with some of our top athletes,” Humphreys said.
“We do have casts of their feet and their lower legs so we can work on them in terms of pressure points and customisation without the athlete having to be there.”
For Atomic, their top athletes are local product Hirscher, who lives close to Altenmarkt, and Shiffrin, who won the slalom gold in Sochi and became the overall World Cup women’s champion this year.
“I started skiing on Atomic when I was 12 and have skied Atomic skis, boots, and bindings since then,” the American told Reuters.
“It was just a natural progression for me to stick with the skis that I had been so confident on as I started racing on the World Cup.”
Atomic, like the other manufacturers HEAD and Frances’ Rossignol, send their technical experts to accompany the top racers at every event, working closely with their coaches and national federations, to tune and service their gear like a Formula One team to suit the conditions.
“They’re athletes, they’re champions, they’re demanding,” Mayrhofer added.
“Therefore you need a team. For Hirscher, for Shiffrin you have a dedicated team with ski makers, boot specialists, you have all the experts there.”
With the event now in sight, Mayrhofer said he felt quietly confident all of their planning would pay off.
”I have a good feeling we are nicely prepared. I feel good we will have everything we need,“ he said. ”Then it’s always (necessary) of course to be a bit lucky also.
“But we have great athletes, we have all the stuff together which is needed to win.”


LONDON (Reuters) - Olympic downhills have a special allure, with the fastest and bravest Alpine skiers going full tilt for gold and a place in history.
Pyeongchang will see no change there but newer events more targeted at millenials and younger audiences may be muscling in on the limelight enjoyed by the traditional blue riband races.
The mixed team event, run already at world championships and featuring male and female skiers in a parallel slalom format with races lasting some 25 seconds, should be a hit on its   Olympic debut.
“I think it will be one of the highlights of the Olympics,” women’s Alpine race director Atle Skaardal, a two times men’s Super-G world champion for Norway, said before the season started.
Freestyle skiing, slopestyle and big air snowboarding -- another eye-catching 2018 Olympic newcomer -- have the added appeal of proving more accessible to skiers from non-Alpine nations.
Traditional Alpine skiing has been woven into the fabric of the Games since 1936, even if the men’s downhill did not appear until 1948, and a core element for broadcasters and the commercial sector alike.
That remains the case, despite the increasing range of media platforms and fragmentation of the audience as a whole.
“Alpine is always going to be the blue riband,” Matt Humphreys, winter sports boss at the UK division of ski suppliers Head told Reuters.
”When you look at these other events like slopestyle, skicross, the younger sports, they do capture the imagination probably a little bit better than Alpine because it’s newer and fresher.
“But ... I think it’s always going to be the Alpine that wins out.”
Reflecting its big ticket status, the men’s downhill will be held on the opening Sunday of the Games at the Jeongseong Alpine centre.
About as extreme as it gets, the dangerous and daunting discipline sees racers hurtling in excess of 130kph down the mountain -- and the winner often a surprise from far down the list of favorites.
For U.S. audiences the women’s race on Feb. 21 could be an even bigger deal than the men‘s, with American speed queen Lindsey Vonn and all-rounder Mikaela Shiffrin two of the more recognizable names on the slopes.
Vonn, the most successful women’s World Cup ski racer of all-time with a record 78 victories, has a portfolio of sponsors that includes Under Armour, Red Bull and Head and was ranked by Forbes as the third highest earning athlete at the 2010 Vancouver Olympics.
NBC television said Pyeongchang, 14 hours ahead of U.S. Eastern Time (ET), will be their “most live primetime” Winter Games yet and live Alpine skiing will feature on 11 of the 18 nights.
The U.S. network has already reported increased viewing figures for the North American rounds of the World Cup season.
Eurosport Chief Executive Peter Hutton said his broadcaster was also seeing increased viewing figures across snow sports, with all the Olympic competitions to be available on mobile devices.
“Sports such as snowboarding are doing a great job to attract younger audiences,” he added.
Eurosport will also, for the first time, have a dedicated ‘Radical Van’ mobile social media studio at the PyeongChang Snowpark and other venues to cater for new audiences.
The growth of the newer sports, however, was not cannibalizing the traditional Alpine events and was in fact benefiting them, according Rob Prazmark, founder and chief executive of 21 Sports and Entertainment Marketing Group.
“That’s a good thing, for the Olympic Winter Games, that they are able to change up the sport to appeal to a younger and a different demographic,” he told Reuters in a telephone interview.
”I think interest in Alpine grows because of the addition of different or extreme sports -- or sports that are really most popular with a younger demographic. The whole business of Alpine is growing.
“Downhill Alpine is still extreme,” added Prazmark, who has been involved in every Olympics since 1984 as a consultant and rights negotiator.
That said, he was aware from his own family how the recreational landscape was changing.
“I’ve got four kids. They run in ages from 34 to 21. My 21-year-old has never been on skis. She’s only been on a snowboard,” he said.
”And she doesn’t quite understand the attraction of skis.
”So that’s where there’s a big shift into the extreme sports, I believe.
“It’s a generational, millennial thing as well.”


(Reuters) - Britain’s Johanna Konta was pushed to the brink for the second time in as many rounds before advancing to the quarter-finals while world number two Garbine Muguruza of Spain succumbed to leg cramps in her opening clash at the Brisbane International on Tuesday.
Konta, who overcame local hope Ajla Tomljanovic 4-6 6-1 6-4 in two hours and 26 minutes at the Pat Rafter Arena, set up a meeting with the winner of the match between Ukraine’s Elina Svitolina and Croatia’s Ana Konjuh.
The Briton faced 13 break points in the first set and struggled with her rhythm as the big-hitting Tomljanovic stormed into an early lead.
Konta, who had similar struggles with her serve in her opening match against American Madison Keys, a U.S. Open finalist, on Monday, responded with a better performance to level the contest.
The world number nine raced to a 5-2 lead in the deciding set before Tomljanovic showed signs of fighting back. However, Konta held on to finish the job.
”She made that very difficult, so that’s a credit to her and she played incredibly freely at the end of the third set,“ Konta said after the match. ”There wasn’t a lot in it so I‘m very happy to have just stayed tough and just come through that.
“To be honest, it’s a great thing to have two tough matches early on. It’s a boost, the match fitness, and it boosts a lot of the competitive scenarios that we’re going to face the whole year. I‘m sure my next match will be the same.”
Muguruza’s wretched run of injury problems at Brisbane extended to a fourth consecutive year with the Spaniard unable to continue while leading 2-1 in the deciding third set against Serbia’s Aleksandra Krunic.
Meanwhile, France’s Alize Cornet defeated Croatia’s Mirjana Lucic-Baroni 6-1 7-5 to move into the quarter-finals and was joined by seventh seed Anastasija Sevastova of Latvia who beat Romania’s Sorana Cirstea 6-2 6-1.


(Reuters) - Kyle Edmund was taken the distance before he outlasted talented Canadian teenager Denis Shapovalov in the opening round of the Brisbane International on Tuesday.
Edmund, who prevailed 6-7(5) 7-6(4) 6-4, struggled with his serve right from the start of the match but managed to save five out of six break points to overcome his opponent in two hours and 30 minutes.
“Everyone wants to start well but the year is so long that if there’s positivity you feel good but even if you don’t start well it doesn’t mean the year is going to be a bad one,” the Briton said.
“It’s always good to come to Brisbane, I made the quarters last year, got a good win this year so it’s definitely helped my game going into the year.”
Edmund next plays Chung Hyeon after the South Korean world number 58 withstood a barrage of booming serves from fifth seed Gilles Muller before winning 6-3 7-6(1).
Earlier, former world number one Andy Murray’s lingering hip issues forced him to withdraw from the event with the Briton admitting he was unsure whether he could recover in time for the Australian Open later this month.
American Michael Mmoh won his first match on the ATP Tour after seven previous defeats, with a clinical 6-3 6-4 victory over Federico Delbonis. The teenager takes on eighth seed Mischa Zverev in his next match.
Denis Istomin had to dig deep to stun seventh seed Damir Dzumhur, winning 6-7(4), 6-3, 6-2 in two hours and 24 minutes.


CAIRO (Reuters) - A group of Egyptian soccer players have formed a team for one-legged players, hoping to start league for disabled players in the country.
“The Miracle Team,” consists of twenty-five players from across Egypt who meet twice a week to train on a pitch in Cairo. While the team began training in freestyle soccer - a non-competitive art where players perform tricks with a ball - they soon decided to aim higher.
“I started bringing the people in and coach Yousry, the team coach, called me to start training me on freestyle football,” team captain Mahmoud Ibrahim Tawfik, who lost a leg in a road accident more than 20 years ago, told Reuters.
“I told him I have another dream of becoming a real life soccer player not just a freestyle footballer who has skills.”
The team hope to inspire other disabled Egyptians to take up the sport and eventually establish a federation which could regulate a domestic league for the disabled.
“In each governorate we are asking the players to form a team to spread the game,” said team coach Yousry Mohamed Ibrahim.
Despite their enthusiasm, the team faces a raft of challenges: a lack of funding, a paucity of special playing crutches and difficulties finding a regular pitch for training.
Amputee Football has special rules: seven leg-amputee players play on each opposing team, and the goalkeepers must have one arm. Crutches are not allowed to touch the ball and there is no offside rule or limits to substitutions.
There are 42 nations who now have national amputee football federations, according to the World Amputee Football Federation. The next amputee football World Cup is being held in Mexico later this year.


(Reuters) - Maria Sharapova was made to work hard for a victory at the Shenzhen Open, coming from behind to beat unseeded American Alison Riske 4-6 6-3 6-2 in the second round on Tuesday.
The five-times grand slam champion fired 34 winners and saved seven out of 10 break points to get past her spirited opponent and set up a quarter-final clash with Kazakhstan’s Zarina Diyas who beat local hope Zhang Shuai 6-3 6-7(5) 6-4.
Twice a finalist at Shenzhen, Riske used power and precision to breeze through the first set and went up 2-1 in the second to leave Sharapova in trouble. The Russian then reeled off five of the next six games to level the contest at one set apiece.
Sharapova did not let the momentum slip in the deciding set, winning the final four games of the match to prevail in two hours and 22 minutes.
“I‘m glad I got this kind of match,” Sharapova said. “These are the kind of matches you need, especially with such a short preparation going into the Australian Open in terms of match play.”
Earlier, Kristyna Pliskova, the twin of former world number one Karolina Pliskova, stunned French Open champion Jelena Ostapenko 6-1 6-4 and stormed into the second round.
World number seven Ostapenko, who beat returning multiple major champion Serena Williams in an exhibition match in Abu Dhabi over the weekend, was undone by Pliskova’s powerful serves.
“My serve was great today, especially in the first set,” the world number 61 said after her second career win over a top 10 opponent. “I feel like it’s fast here, so that can be tricky for both of us, and the first of us playing fast won the point.”
Pliskova next takes on Romania’s Ana Bogdan, who comfortably defeated Italy’s Camila Giorgi 6-4 6-2.


(Reuters) - Former world number one Andy Murray’s lingering hip issues forced him to withdraw from the Brisbane International on Tuesday with the Briton admitting he was unsure whether he could recover in time for the Australian Open later this month.
Murray has not played a competitive match since a Wimbledon quarter-final loss last July due to the complaint and despite coming through a one-set exhibition in Abu Dhabi last week, he was unable to train on Tuesday and announced his withdrawal.
“I‘m very disappointed to be withdrawing from the Brisbane International,” Murray, seeded second in Brisbane, told tournament organizers before going into further detail of his predicament in an emotional post on social media.
“Having been recommended to treat my hip conservatively since the U.S. Open, I have done everything asked of me from a rehab perspective and worked extremely hard to try get back on the court competing,” Murray said on his Instagram account.
”Having played practice sets here in Brisbane with some top players unfortunately this hasn’t worked yet to get me to the level I would like so I have to reassess my options. Continuing rehab is one option and giving my hip more time to recover.
“Surgery is also an option but the chances of a successful outcome are not as high as I would like which has made this my secondary option and my hope has been to avoid that. However, this is something I may have to consider but let’s hope not.”
The world number 16 had been due to play his first tournament match of the season on Thursday with a second-round encounter against American Ryan Harrison at Pat Rafter Arena. He will be replaced by German lucky loser Yannick Hanfmann.
Murray, who said on Sunday that he planned to trim his schedule in 2018 to prevent a recurrence of his injury issues, will remain in Brisbane for the rest of the week before planning his next move.
“In the short term I‘m going to be staying in Australia for the next couple of days to see if my hip settles down a bit and will decide by the weekend whether to stay out here or fly home to assess what I do next,” the 30-year-old added.
“Sorry for the long post but I wanted to keep everyone in the loop and get this off my chest as it’s really hurting inside.”
Brisbane tournament director Cameron Pearson wished the three-times grand slam winner well.
“I‘m really disappointed for Andy, as I know how much he was looking forward to getting his season started in Brisbane,” he said.
“As a two-time former champion, he has great memories of playing on Pat Rafter Arena and thrilling his fans. I wish him all the best to be ready to play the Australian Open.”
Murray’s latest injury setback will also come as a blow to Australian Open organizers ahead of the year’s first major in Melbourne starting on Jan. 15, along with those of fellow “Big Four” members Rafael Nadal (back) and Novak Djokovic (elbow).


(Reuters) - Caroline Wozniacki capped 2017 with the biggest win of her career when she claimed a maiden WTA Finals triumph in October and the Dane has carried that momentum into the new season with a ruthless display to kick off her Auckland Classic campaign.
The top seed has a chance to usurp world number one Simona Halep with a victory in New Zealand and the 27-year-old needed just 58 minutes to race past American Madison Brengle with a 6-3 6-0 triumph in their first round encounter on Tuesday.
The world number three is still searching for her first grand slam triumph but after emerging victorious in the elite eight-woman event in Singapore, her raised levels of play could see her make that breakthrough in Melbourne later this month.
Wozniacki is also searching for a first triumph in Auckland after reaching the final in 2015 and despite being tested by Brengle early the contest, the Dane pulled away once she found her rhythm and claimed the last seven games to seal victory.
”I thought I played pretty well, especially considering it’s the first match back of the year,“ Wozniacki told reporters. ”It took me a couple of games to kind of just get the rhythm and then I started playing better and better.
“I‘m just trying to get my legs moving, trying to make the right decisions, wait for the right shots to play aggressive and go for it, and find the right balance of offense and defense.”
The win set up a second round encounter against Croatia’s Petra Martic, who overcame Czech player Marketa Vondrousova 7-6(2) 6-3 in their first round tie to advance.
Elsewhere, former world number two and 2013 Auckland champion Agnieszka Radwanska was forced to dig deep to remain on a semi-final collision course with Wozniacki when the Pole eked out a 6-2 4-6 6-2 victory over Brazil’s Beatriz Haddad Maia.
“I‘m just very happy to win my first match of 2018, and I think it was good timing to come back and do it here in Auckland after five years,” Radwanska, who has seen her ranking drop to 28th after a poor 2017, said in her on-court interview.
Third seed Barbora Strycova was also taken the distance in her first round encounter against Italy’s Sara Errani, the Czech emerging with a 6-4 6-7(3) 6-4 victory to set up a second round tie against Sweden’s Johanna Larsson.
The day did not pass without three upsets, however, with defending champion and fifth seed Lauren Davis losing 6-1 6-2 to fellow American Sachia Vickery, while sixth seed Yulia Putintseva and seventh seed Mona Barthel both suffered straight set losses.
The Australian Open is the first grand slam of the season and runs from Jan 15-28 in Melbourne.


(Reuters) - Angelique Kerber showed plenty of tenacity to beat Belgium’s Elise Mertens before teaming up with Alexander Zverev to help Germany get their Hopman Cup campaign off to a winning start at the Perth Arena on Monday.
Kerber put Germany ahead with a hard-fought 7-6(6) 7-6(1) victory over Mertens in the round robin stage of the eight-nation mixed team event.
David Goffin helped Belgium get back into the contest with a clinical 6-3 6-3 win over world number four Zverev to leave the tie at 1-1. But Kerber and Zverev were too strong for their rivals in the deciding mixed doubles rubber, winning 4-2 4-3.
Kerber started her singles match slowly, conceded an early break but fought back to claim three games in a row. She saved a set point at 5-6 and then forced a tiebreak which she won with a crisp backhand winner.
The former world number one raced to a 3-1 lead in the second set as Mertens struggled to cut out the errors. Despite saving a match point, Mertens could not match her rival in the tiebreak as Kerber prevailed in two hours.
”It gives me a lot of confidence to start the year like this,“ said the world number 21. ”I think I need a few more matches to really get into my rhythm. However, for a start it was a good job.
“My goal is to play the three matches, hopefully four, and to find a good transition from all the practice to the match court ahead of the first grand slam of the year.”


(Reuters) - Mischa Zverev powered past Australian qualifier John-Patrick Smith 6-4 7-5 to enter the second round of the Brisbane International on Monday.
Eighth seed Zverev fired four aces in the match and converted five out of six break points to come through in an hour and 28 minutes. The German will meet the winner of Tuesday’s match between Argentine Federico Delbonis and American Michael Mmoh.
Earlier, local hope Matthew Ebden dumped out Frances Tiafoe with a 6-3 6-2 victory that set up an all-Australian second round clash with the big-serving Nick Kyrgios.
“Nick has obviously got a great serve,” Ebden said, looking ahead to Wednesday’s match.
”That’s one of his biggest weapons that carried him through well over the past few years, with the upsets and good results that he’s had. He’s obviously good around the court. He moves well for a big guy.
“Last year I played (Ivo) Karlovic, I played (John) Isner, these kind of guys. So I wouldn’t say Nick’s serve is maybe as big or as tall as those guys’, but he’s obviously very accurate and uses it well.”
Ryan Harrison downed Leonardo Mayer 6-4 3-6 6-2 while fellow American Jared Donaldson eased past Jordan Thompson 6-2 6-4. Horacio Zeballos needed 72 minutes to beat Ernesto Escobedo 6-3 6-4 and meets Alexandr Dolgopolov next.


(Reuters) - Johanna Konta made a shaky start to the new season before battling past U.S. Open finalist Madison Keys and into the second round of the Brisbane International on Monday.
Konta, who prevailed 4-6 6-4 6-3, needed two hours and eight minutes to quell the challenge of her American opponent as her usually reliable serve sputtered early on before eventually coming to her rescue at the Pat Rafter Arena.
“This was my first match in quite a while, so I‘m really happy to have had such a competitive match against such a great player,” Konta said.
“It was a really tough first round for both of us. Madison is an incredibly good player, so I feel very lucky that I got to play her so early on and really have a good match.”
World number 19 Keys missed eight opportunities to break Konta’s serve before she finally succeeded while up 5-4 to take the first set with a powerful forehand drive.
Konta appeared to calm her serve and nerve in the second set, fighting back with an early break to go up 3-2. The world number nine then held on to level the match at one set apiece.
The Briton battled her way to a 2-0 lead in the decider as Keys began to tire and finished the match with another break to set up a clash with Ajla Tomljanovic in the next round.
Belarusian qualifier Aliaksandra Sasnovich came from behind to upset sixth seed Kristina Mladenovic 1-6 6-3 7-5 while Elina Svitolina beat Spain’s Carla Suarez Navarro 6-2 6-4. Ukraine’s Lesia Tsurenko then stunned eighth seed Ashleigh Barty 6-3 6-2.
Double Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova withdrew from the event with a viral illness. The 27-year-old Czech was unable to take the court against Estonian Anett Kontaveit and was replaced in the draw by lucky loser Heather Watson.


BRISBANE (Reuters) - Twice Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova withdrew from the Brisbane International with a viral illness on Monday.
The 27-year-old Czech was unable to take the court in her first round match against Estonian Anett Kontaveit and was replaced in the draw by lucky loser Heather Watson.
“I‘m really disappointed to withdraw from the Brisbane International,” Kvitova was quoted as saying on the WTA website.
”Unfortunately I picked up a virus on the flight to Australia and I haven’t been able to get healthy in time to play here.
“It’s always a fantastic and competitive place to start the year so I‘m sorry not to be in the draw.”
The former world number two required four hours of surgery on her left hand in December 2016 after being attacked by a man wielding a knife who had gained access to her apartment by posing as a utility worker.
Kvitova returned to action, after months of rehabilitation, during the French Open in May and went on to win the Aegon Classic in June.
She last played at the Tianjin Open in October and was preparing to open her 2018 season in Brisbane.


(Reuters) - Jack Del Rio was close to tears as he revealed he had been fired as head coach by the Oakland Raiders on Sunday, shortly after the National Football League (NFL) team completed their final game of the season.
Del Rio’s departure came just three hours after the Indianapolis Colts said they also had sacked their head coach Chuck Pagano.
The 57-year-old Pagano, who had been in charge of Indianapolis for six seasons, was widely expected to be sacked after the Colts posted a 4-12 record that ended with a 22-13 win over the Houston Texans.
But Del Rio’s sacking after three seasons was less predictable, coming less than a year after he signed a four-year contract extension following a successful 2016, when the Raiders went 12-4 and finally made the playoffs after a 13-season drought.
But the team regressed in 2017, going 6-10.
An emotional Del Rio, 54, said it had been a dream to coach his “childhood team” but he acknowledged the reality of the business.
“It’s a results business, I understand,” he told a press conference, his voice cracking.
Del Rio went 25-24 in his three seasons with the Raiders.
Local media reported that former Raiders coach Jon Gruden was likely to replace Del Rio.
Gruden coached the Raiders from 1998-2001, before guiding the Tampa Bay Buccaneers to victory in the 2002 season Super Bowl. He most recently has been working as a television analyst.
The Colts, meanwhile, thanked Pagano for his body of work, while at the same time showing him the door.
“Chuck’s first season was one of the more inspirational stories in NFL history as he courageously battled and overcame leukemia,” Colts Owner & CEO Jim Irsay said in a statement.
Pagano, speaking before his firing had been announced, said: “I‘m just grateful I‘m on this side of the dirt,” referring to his recovery from leukemia.
Pagano guided the Colts to a 56-46 overall record (including the post-season) after joining the team in 2012.
He led them to three consecutive 11-5 seasons and playoff appearances from 2012-14, which included the 2014 AFC Championship game.
But the team failed to compile a winning record the past three seasons as they were hampered by multiple injuries to quarterback Andrew Luck.
Del Rio and Pagano are likely to be joined by several other sacked head coaches over the next couple of days.
Ben McAdoo of the New York Giants was the only head coach fired during the season.


(Reuters) - The Buffalo Bills ended the longest playoff drought in North American major team sports when they qualified for the National Football League post-season on Sunday.
The Bills were last in the playoffs when Bill Clinton was in his final year in the White House in 1999, but after 17 fruitless seasons they gave themselves a chance with a 22-16 win over the Miami Dolphins on the last day of the regular season.
The victory, however, was not enough for Buffalo, who also needed Cincinnati to beat Baltimore.
They nervously watched on television in the locker room in Miami as Bengals’ quarterback Andy Dalton connected on fourth down with a 49-yard touchdown pass to Tyler Boyd to earn a 31-27 win at the death and send Buffalo’s players into delirium.
“It’s been a long time coming,” Buffalo coach Sean McDermott told reporters.
Buffalo were not the only team to seal their playoffs spot on the final day of the season with the Atlanta Falcons and Tennessee Titans also winning their respective games to earn their way into the post-season.
Tennessee beat the Jaguars 15-10 in Nashville, while the Falcons, last year’s Super Bowl losers, also snuck in with a 22-10 victory over the Carolina Panthers.
The top two seeds, who earn a first round bye, in the AFC had already been decided, though the New England Patriots had to win on Sunday, which they duly did over the New York Jets, to take the number one spot ahead of the Pittsburgh Steelers.
In the NFC, the Philadelphia Eagles had already locked up top seed, though after a 6-0 loss against Dallas on Sunday they enter the post-season as an underdog with first choice quarterback Carson Wentz out with a knee injury.
The Minnesota Vikings clinched the second NFC seed with victory over the Chicago Bears.
The playoffs will begin with four wildcard games between the teams ranked three to six next Saturday and Sunday.

MELBOURNE (Reuters) - World number one Rafa Nadal, who is struggling to get any match practice before the Australian Open, will play an exhibition event at Melbourne Park in the week leading up to the season opening grand slam, organizers said on Monday.
The 31-year-old Spaniard has not played since he withdrew from the season-ending World Tour Finals in London in November with a knee injury.
He had already withdrawn from an exhibition tournament in Abu Dhabi, this week’s Brisbane International and another event in Sydney, citing a lack of time to properly prepare.
However, the 16-times grand slam winner will be part of the winner-takes all Tie Break Tens event at Melbourne Park on Jan. 10, five days before the Australian Open begins.
“Tie Break Tens is a great concept and we will see and play some exciting matches,” Nadal said in a statement.
“The field is fantastic and I expect some tough competition which will be great for the Aussie fans.”
The eight-man field includes Novak Djokovic, three-time grand slam winner Stan Wawrinka, Australia’s Nick Kyrgios, and former world number one Lleyton Hewitt.
Each match is comprised solely of super tie breaks to 10 points. The knockout tournament provides a winner take-all purse of $250,000.
“It really will be an intriguing contest,” Australian Open Tournament Director Craig Tiley said.
”These guys are all coming in at different stages of their preparation, but once their competitive instincts kick in, which will be almost instant in this format, there will be some absorbing contests.
“Remember, there is not much room for error. You lose the tie break and you are out.”


(The Sports Xchange) - Highlights of Sunday’s National Football League games:
Patriots 26, Jets 6
The New England Patriots locked up the No. 1 seed in the AFC and home-field advantage in the playoffs with a 26-6 victory over the New York Jets on Sunday afternoon in arctic conditions at Gillette Stadium in Massachusetts.
The AFC East champion Patriots wrapped up their regular season at 13-3 to secure the conference’s top spot for a second consecutive season and the seventh time overall.
Dion Lewis totaled 133 yards (93 rushing, 40 receiving) and scored two touchdowns while Tom Brady completed 18-of-37 passes for 190 yards and two touchdowns for the Patriots.
The 40-year-old Brady came out of the game in favor of backup Brian Hoyer with 5:59 left in the fourth quarter.
New York (5-11) finished last in the AFC East for the second straight season and the third time in four years.
Vikings 23, Bears 10
Minnesota had a few flaws in their offense and special teams during a 23-10 win over the Chicago Bears, but the Vikings will have an extra week to work on them before opening the playoffs at home.
The Vikings (13-3) clinched a first-round bye with the win over Chicago and may have spelled the end for Bears head coach John Fox, who is widely expected to be dismissed after his team finished 5-11.
Minnesota’s last bye in the first round came in the 2010 playoffs.
Steelers 28, Browns 24
The Pittsburgh Steelers beat Cleveland 28-24 to make the Browns the second 0-16 team in NFL history. The 2008 Detroit Lions also went 0-16.
The playoff-bound Steelers started Landry Jones at quarterback in place of Ben Roethlisberger and Jones completed 23-of-27 passes for 239 yards and a touchdown in guiding the Steelers to their 13th win of the season.
Colts 22, Texans 13
Indianapolis running back Frank Gore rushed for 100 yards on 24 carries to help lead the Colts to a 22-13 victory over the Houston Texans at Lucas Oil Stadium.
The Colts limited the Texans to 209 total yards and got a safety. Each AFC South team finished with a 4-12 record.
Jacoby Brissett completed 15-of-24 passes for 114 yards and one touchdown for Indianapolis.
Lions 35, Packers 11
Matthew Stafford threw three touchdown passes and also caught a two-point conversion as the Detroit Lions closed out their season with a 35-11 romp over the depleted Green Bay Packers at Ford Field.
Kenny Golladay had a 54-yard touchdown catch for the Lions (9-7) in what may have been head coach Jim Caldwell’s final game with the franchise. There has been heavy speculation that Caldwell will not be retained for a fifth season.
Cowboys 6, Eagles 0
Quarterback Dak Prescott threw a 12-yard touchdown pass to Brice Butler early in the fourth quarter and the Dallas Cowboys held on for a 6-0 victory over the Philadelphia Eagles at frigid Lincoln Financial Field.
Despite having already been eliminated from playoff contention, the Cowboys still finished with a winning record at 9-7.
After last week’s ineffective performance in a 19-10 win over the Oakland Raiders, coach Doug Pederson opted to bring back starter Nick Foles against the Cowboys.
Foles didn’t perform well once again, going 4 of 11 for 39 yards, one interception and a miniscule 9.3 quarterback rating.
Giants 18, Redskins 10
The New York Giants scored two touchdowns in just over two minutes as they topped the Washington Redskins 18-10 at MetLife Stadium.
New York quarterback Eli Manning made his 216th appearance, which ties Hall-of-Fame defensive end Michael Strahan’s franchise record for the most games played in a Giants uniform.


(Reuters) - The wretched Cleveland Browns completed a season of complete futility when they lost again on Sunday, if only narrowly, which means coach Hue Jackson can go jump in the lake.
After Cleveland went 1-15 in the 2016 season, Jackson vowed that he would swim in icy Lake Erie if the team did not improve in 2017.
But improve it did not. Instead, the Browns pulled off the difficult feat of actually regressing, becoming only the second team in NFL history to go 0-16, joining the 2008 Detroit Lions.
“Let’s just be honest and put it out there, I‘m disappointed, I‘m pissed off, because I never saw this being this way in two years here, ever.” Jackson said recently.
“I made that statement (about swimming in the lake). I got to back it up.”
Whether he does so during the frigid winter, or waits for balmier weather and warmer water remains to be seen.
Early on in 2017 it seemed the Browns would win a game or two. Their first seven games included four narrow defeats by three points, but a promising autumn subsequently gave way to a bitter winter of discontent and a series of embarrassing defeats, culminating in a four-point loss against a second-string Pittsburgh team on Sunday.
“This is going to stay next to my name and the organization’s name for the rest of our lives,” Jackson said after Sunday’s game.
“There’s nothing we can do. We’ll turn the page on this and move forward.”
Not that the team’s long suffering fans will expect much difference in 2018, even though the Browns, with the first and fourth picks in the upcoming draft, should improve if they make wise choices, a big “if” based on recent history.
The Browns have missed the playoffs in 15 successive seasons, and have just one winning season in that stretch, going 67-173.
So why have the Browns remained so perennially bad when their poor record has given them so many high draft picks?
The reasons are somewhat debatable, but some bad draft choices (and non-choices) have not helped, none more disastrous than overlooking Ohio’s very own Ben Roethlisberger in the 2004 draft.
Big Ben instead went to the nearby Pittsburgh Steelers, and the rest is history (two Super Bowl championships).
On the other side of the ledger was the decision to take another quarterback, college football Heisman Trophy winner Johnny Manziel, in 2014, with a view to making the quarterback the face of the franchise, only to watch him self-destruct with a series of off-field problems that left him unemployed two years later.
The quarterback issue still has not been solved. In the past couple of years the Browns have passed on the likes of Deshuan Watson and Carson Wentz, who have blossomed with other teams, while DeShone Kizer labored in his first season.
Coach Jackson is not immune from blame either, but owner Jimmy Haslam should ultimately shoulder most of the responsibility since he bought the team from Randy Lerner in 2012.
Hindsight is always easy, but it cannot be denied that Haslam has made some questionable decisions, not least putting together a front office that realized too late that jettisoning so many veterans in favor of young players who were not NFL-ready was a dubious strategy.


BRISBANE (Reuters) - Fourth seed Caroline Garcia left the court in tears after a lower back injury forced the Frenchwoman to retire from her first round match against Alize Cornet at the Brisbane International on Sunday.
The 24-year-old, who struggled with a back injury last season, claimed the first set 6-3 before Cornet prevailed by the same score in the second to force the decider in the all-French encounter.
Garcia appeared to be suffering from some discomfort and took a medical timeout before the final set. She tried to hit a couple of serves before deciding she could not continue and retired in tears.
“I’ve always had some issues with my back,” Garcia told reporters.
“At the beginning of the match I felt a pain in my lower back and it was different than it is normally. It was getting worse and worse and in the end I couldn’t really move. There was no point to keep going.”
She was hopeful the injury would not affect her Australian Open prospects next month.
“I mean, it’s in two weeks, so it’s a long time... with the back it’s always complicated,” she added. “Especially mine, it’s really something I take care of, so it’s kind of surprising for it to show up like this. But we’ll do the best that we can.”
Cornet will met Mirjana Lucic-Baroni in the second round after the Croatian, who travels full-time with her daughter, overcame Germany’s Tatjana Maria 6-4 4-6 6-0.
“I‘m very sorry for Caroline. I know what it’s like to have back pain,” Cornet, who went down to Karolina Pliskova in last year’s final, said in a courtside interview.
”I hope she recovers for the next tournament in the Australian Open. I cannot say I‘m glad to be through this way, but the adventure continues for me.
“Last year, I had a super run to the final and I have very good memories. I hope to go as far as possible.”
Elsewhere, seventh seed Anastasija Sevastova beat local favorite Sam Stosur 6-1 6-3, while Ana Konjuh tamed Kiki Bertens 6-1 6-2.
In the men’s section, Ukraine’s Alexandr Dolgopolov caused a minor upset with a hard fought victory over sixth seed Diego Schwartzman of Argentina 6-4 7-6(3).


(The Sports Xchange) - Giannis Antetokounmpo caught the inbounds pass and immediately turned to size up his defender.
Antetokounmpo took a quick step to his right, crossing over his left leg toward the baseline as he drove around the Oklahoma City Thunder’s Josh Heustis and then elevated toward the basket.
The Milwaukee Bucks star needed every bit of lift he could get, muscling on Thunder star Russell Westbrook just enough to get the dunk to fall through for the game-winner with 1.3 seconds left to lift the Bucks to a 97-95 win Friday night at Chesapeake Energy Arena.
The play left the Thunder fuming.
Antetokounmpo appeared to step out of bounds with his left foot as he drove past Heustis, and Oklahoma City players pointed at the video board high above the court.
The Thunder got composed enough for Westbrook to heave a desperation 3-pointer toward the bucket, but it came up short.
Antetokounmpo said afterward he hadn’t seen the play and said he wasn’t aware at the time that he might’ve stepped out of bounds.
“Coach trusted me having the ball late and making that play and do what I do best and go to the rim and try to make it happen,” Antetokounmpo said.
Afterward, several Thunder players continued protesting to the officials, as the replay was once again shown in the building, this time zeroing in on Antetokounmpo’s foot on the baseline.
“I guess we’ll see something on the ticker that says the referees missed that one,” Oklahoma City’s Carmelo Anthony said.
“We can’t do nothing about that at this point, so we might as well forget about it and move on and get ready for ... who do we play Sunday? Dallas? Get ready for Dallas.”
Thunder coach Billy Donovan wasn’t among those protesting.
“I asked them if they could review it and they said they could not review it,” Donovan said. “That’s the only explanation I got.”
After the game, crew chief Derrick Stafford told a pool reporter the play was not reviewable.
“In any reviewable matter, there has to be a whistle called on the floor,” Stafford said. “There was no whistle blown for the play, so we couldn’t review it.”
Bucks coach Jason Kidd didn’t get too caught up in the call.
“I don’t understand the whole protest,” Kidd said. “I can only worry about the score and then them trying to put time on the clock.”
It was a strange end to a wild game.
The Bucks built up a 22-point lead in the first quarter and then slowly gave the lead up before Westbrook’s deep 3-pointer with 5.7 seconds left tied the game for the first time since it was scoreless.
Milwaukee called a timeout to advance the ball, setting up Antetokounmpo’s game-winner.
Antetokounmpo finished with 23 points and 12 rebounds to lead Milwaukee (19-15) to its second consecutive win. Khris Middleton added 20, John Henson 18 and Tony Snell 15.
“Just getting a win is big,” Antetokounmpo said. “I think I did a good job moving the ball offensively and playing hard defensively.”
A night before, Milwaukee came back from a 20-point deficit to beat Minnesota.
Westbrook scored a season-high 40 points, 14 in the final quarter. Anthony and Jerami Grant added 12 each for the Thunder (20-16), who had a six-game winning streak snapped.
“I‘m more concerned about the fact that we didn’t play well in the first quarter,” Donovan said.


(The Sports Xchange) - Houston Rockets point guard Chris Paul will return from a three-game injury absence to play in Friday’s game against the Washington Wizards.
Paul has been sidelined due to a groin injury. Rockets coach Mike D‘Antoni confirmed Paul would be in the lineup. Houston, which lost its last four games, is 15-1 when Paul is in the lineup and 10-7 when he sits out.
Also, the NBA confirmed two offensive foul calls against Rockets star James Harden in the final seconds of Thursday’s game with the Boston Celtics were correct. Harden bitterly complained after the 99-98 loss about the two calls made in the final 7.3 seconds.
Boston guard Marcus Smart was the defender in each instance and the NBA’s report stated “Harden dislodges Smart from his legal guarding position” on both occasions.
The Toronto Raptors suspended power forward Serge Ibaka one game for a violation of team rules.
The suspension, which was announced hours before Friday’s game against the Atlanta Hawks, resulted from an altercation that took place between Ibaka and a team staff member after a 124-107 loss at Oklahoma City on Wednesday.
Ibaka is averaging 13.8 points on 50.5 percent shooting and six rebounds in 30 games.
San Antonio Spurs forward Rudy Gay will miss at least two weeks due to a right heel injury, according to the team.
An MRI exam performed Friday detected inflammation in the bursa sac. Gay departed Thursday’s game against the New York Knicks due to soreness in the heel.


(The Sports Xchange) - The New York Jets extended the contracts of coach Todd Bowles and general manager Mike Maccagnan on Friday despite the team’s lackluster 5-10 record.
The deals of both men were extended through the 2020 campaign.
Bowles is 20-27 in his three seasons with the Jets. The team started 3-2 this season before collapsing with eight setbacks in the past 10 games. Maccagnan is also finishing up his third season with the team.
The Tampa Bay Buccaneers have decided to retain coach Dirk Koetter, according to multiple reports.
Koetter’s status had been tenuous due to this season’s disappointing performance. The Buccaneers are 4-11 entering Sunday’s finale against the New Orleans Saints. Tampa Bay went 9-7 in 2016 in Koetter’s first season at the helm.
But quarterback Jameis Winston regressed in 2017 and also missed time with a shoulder injury. The Buccaneers are currently mired in their second five-game losing streak of the season.
Tampa Bay’s previous two head coaches were fired after two seasons: Lovie Smith went 8-24 in 2014-15 and Greg Schiano went 11-21 in 2012-13.
With the strong backing of quarterback Aaron Rodgers, the Green Bay Packers and leading wide receiver Davante Adams have agreed to a $56 million contract over four years that will prevent Adams from becoming a free agent in March.
Terms weren’t disclosed by the club but multiple reports say the deal includes an $18 million signing bonus.
Adams, who won’t play in Sunday’s finale at Detroit because of a concussion sustained on Dec. 17 at Carolina, leads the Packers with 74 catches for 885 yards and 10 touchdowns in 14 games.
Green Bay also will be without starting wide receiver Jordy Nelson (shoulder), tight end Richard Rodgers (shoulder), linebacker Nick Perry (ankle/shoulder), guard Jahri Evans (knee), and running back Aaron Jones (knee) for the game against the Lions.
Tennessee Titans running back DeMarco Murray will miss Sunday’s game against the Jacksonville Jaguars, the team announced.
Murray sprained the lateral collateral ligament (LCL) in his right knee during last Sunday’s loss to the Los Angeles Rams. Murray didn’t practice all week and had a noticeable limp on Friday when walking toward the locker room.
Murray rushed for a career-low 659 yards this season and averaged just 3.6 yards per carry. Derrick Henry, who has rushed for a team-best 693 yards, will make his second start of the campaign.
Also, cornerback Logan Ryan (ankle) was listed as questionable for Sunday’s game, one the Titans must win as they battle for an AFC wild-card spot.
A joint review of how the Houston Texans handled concussion protocol in relation to quarterback Tom Savage determined the team will not face discipline for how it handled the situation.
The NFL and NFL Players Association found that letting Savage return to play in the Week 14 game against the San Francisco 49ers was “unacceptable.” A short time after returning to the contest, Savage was tested again and failed the concussion test.
Savage, who is now on injured reserve, suffered the concussion in the second quarter of the game and his hands began twitching. Replays of Savage’s hands weren’t seen by doctors until after he was cleared to return, according to the joint review.
The Pittsburgh Steelers still have a shot at the No. 1 seed in the AFC playoffs, but it’s a small enough chance that the team is likely to hold out at least two offensive stars Sunday.
Right tackle Marcus Gilbert said in a radio interview with the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review that quarterback Ben Roethlisberger and running back Le‘Veon Bell will sit against the winless Cleveland Browns.
Wide receiver Antonio Brown is also out with a calf injury as Pittsburgh (12-3) prepares to host the 0-15 Browns. For the Steelers to grab the top seed, they need a victory coupled with a New England loss at the 5-10 New York Jets.
The Philadelphia Eagles, who have clinched the No. 1 seed in the NFC, will play their starters against the Dallas Cowboys on Sunday.
Coach Doug Pederson didn’t say how long those starters would play as the Eagles (13-2) host the Cowboys (8-7) in a regular-season finale that has no playoff implications.


(Reuters) - Tiger Woods hopes to play a full 2018 schedule, he said on Friday, while at the same time declining to commit even to competing in February’s Genesis Open which is run by his foundation.
Writing a year-end blog on his website on the eve of his 42nd birthday, Woods was generally upbeat about the condition of his surgically-repaired back, but what he did not say was perhaps just as significant.
“One way or another, I will be at Riviera,” the 14-times major champion wrote of the annual PGA Tour event played on the famous course in southern California.
“It’s such an historic site and the course will always have special meaning for me. That’s where it all started back in 1992 when I played in my first PGA Tour event at age 16.”
Woods made his latest comeback in December at the Hero World Challenge in the Bahamas, eight months after undergoing a spinal fusion.
While his performance - he finished equal ninth of 18 players - was competent and he swung with apparent freedom, he acknowledged that he was in uncharted waters.
“I’m continuing to progress and trying to get strong enough to where I can handle a workload again,” he wrote.
”I would love to play a full schedule in 2018. What that entails, including back-to-back events, I don’t know. I just have to continue to work on my body and game and see where I pan out.
“I wish I knew where I was going to play and when I was going to play – it’s a lot easier to prep for that – but we really don’t know.”
Woods also acknowledged that his swing had changed.
”My swing is definitely shorter and I can’t turn as far. My back is fused and that’s as far as it’s going to go. But I was surprised at how explosive I was (at the World Challenge)...
“I’m more than a full-club longer than when I shut it down. I wasn’t hitting it very far and was struggling to hit it solid. That’s a bad combo.”
Woods, the second most successful golfer behind 18-times major winner Jack Nicklaus, has endured a challenging time since ending his 2014 season early in order to undergo what turned into multiple back surgeries.
He has played only occasionally since, with a couple of comebacks aborted by continuing pain.
In 2017 he decided to have two vertebrae in his lower back fused, which basically was an all-or-nothing last-ditch attempt to both ease his pain and allow him to resume golf.
The prognosis right now appears to be fairly good, but it has been far from smooth sailing this year for Woods, who in May was arrested asleep at the wheel of his car, with five drugs in his system.
He subsequently pleaded guilty to reckless driving.
“I appreciate competitive golf now more than I ever have,” he wrote.
”During that 10-month period I was away from the game, I had a hard time walking and often needed assistance getting out of bed.
”To go from that and be able to play golf - I hadn’t played without pain for a long time - it was nice...
“It’s been a year filled with ups and downs, but I am very optimistic about 2018 and looking forward to great things on and off the golf course.”


BORMIO, Italy (Reuters) - Frenchman Alexis Pinturault made up a gap of 1.65 seconds on the slalom leg to win the seventh World Cup combined race of his career at Bormio on Friday.
Italian Dominik Paris led after the downhill leg of the two-leg event and was on course to complete his win in the slalom leg until he lost control and straddled a gate near the end of his run.
Pinturault, who finished the downhill in 19th place, charged down the slalom in 50.77 seconds to claim the 21st World Cup win of his career.
Italian Peter Fill was second, 0.42 seconds behind, with Norway’s Kjetil Jansrud third.


LIENZ, Austria (Reuters) - Italian Federica Brignone upset favorites Mikaela Shiffrin and Viktoria Rebensburg to win the women’s giant slalom World Cup race at Lienz on Friday.
Rebensburg led after the first run with Shiffrin second while Brignone was fourth but the 27-year-old overhauled both on the second leg to win by 0.04 seconds from Rebensburg and claim the sixth World Cup win of her career.
Shiffrin, winner of Thursday’s slalom at the same venue, was third, a further 0.04 seconds behind Rebensburg.
Titleholder Shiffrin retained a commanding lead in the overall World Cup standings on 881 points, with Rebensburg second on 510 and Slovakia’s Petra Vlhova third on 385.


(Reuters) - Former world number one Novak Djokovic’s preparation for next month’s Australian Open suffered a blow after he pulled out of the season-opening exhibition event in Abu Dhabi on Friday due to pain in his right elbow.
The 12-time grand slam winner was scheduled to kickstart the new season against Roberto Bautista Agut but was advised by his medical team to skip the tournament just hours before the match.
Djokovic has not played since he was forced to retire against Tomas Berdych in the quarter-finals of Wimbledon in July due to an elbow injury.
“I am terribly disappointed that I am forced to withdraw from the Mubadala World Tennis Championship,” the Serb said in a statement.
”Unfortunately, in the past few days I started to feel pain in the elbow and after several tests, my medical team has advised me not to risk anything, to withdraw from the tournament and to immediately continue with the therapies.
“I am very sad because I was eager to return to playing official matches. Now I need to accept this situation, and to wait for the results of the therapies, in order to start playing tennis again and getting back to full rhythm.”
Organizers said that Britain’s Andy Murray had agreed to step in and play an exhibition match against Bautista Agut instead. Murray has been out of competitive action for six months due to an ongoing hip problem but was in Abu Dhabi as part of his rehabilitation.
The Australian Open, the first grand slam of 2018, begins on Jan. 15 at Melbourne Park.

SEOUL (Reuters) - What does it mean to represent your country at the Olympics? For Brock Radunske, the question has some nuance given the towering, blond-haired Canadian will be suiting-up for South Korea at the 2018 Winter Games.
The ice hockey forward is one of 16 foreign athletes granted South Korean citizenship ahead of February’s Pyeongchang Winter Olympics under changes to the country’s immigration laws that came into effect in 2011.
The changes, the Justice Ministry told Reuters, were aimed at boosting competitiveness in sectors such as sport, science and the economy. The key point was that dual citizenship was now an option for those deemed to have “outstanding ability” who could “contribute to the national interest”.
The first athlete without any Korean lineage ever to be naturalized, Radunske said it was an “honor” to be chosen for Team Korea but that being able to retain his Canadian passport had been a key factor in his decision.
“I grew up in Canada and I‘m proud to be a Canadian, and in a sense I‘m representing Canada too ... when I‘m playing for Team Korea,” the 34-year-old told Reuters.
“I‘m proud to have lived in both countries, so when I‘m on the ice I‘m going to do everything I can for Team Korea.”
Under the previous immigration system, Radunske would not only have had to surrender his Canadian passport but might have been expected to do a 21-month stint in the military.
Radunske has played professional ice hockey in Korea since 2008 when he became the tallest player ever to sign for Anyang Halla. The signing was hugely popular with female fans, who fawned over his imposing 6ft 5in (1.96m) frame and good looks.
Their nickname for him appears to have got lost in translation, however, with Radunske unlikely to encourage the use of “Canadian Big Beauty” when his playing days are over.
A third-round draft pick by the Edmonton Oilers in 2002, Radunske never made it to the NHL and representing Olympic champions Canada was always out of reach.
South Korea was therefore an attractive option but becoming a citizen of one of the world’s least ethnically diverse countries was no easy task.
Radunske had to pass a battery of tests, including of his Korean language skills and knowledge of local culture and history.
His fellow Ontario native Matt Dalton also came through the notoriously difficult process and said his decision to take on citizenship had caused some confusion ‘back home’.
“Being in Canada, some people didn’t even know where Korea was,” said the goaltender.
“And some people were asking, they thought I was representing North Korea, they just didn’t know the difference.”
At a tournament in Russia earlier this month, Dalton said he had conflicting emotions during the playing of the anthems when Korea took on Canada - as they will in their final group game in Pyeongchang.
“When ‘O Canada’ was going on, it was special but it was definitely a little awkward,” he told Yonhap News agency. “I didn’t sleep very well that day.”
South Korea will have seven naturalized players on its men’s ice hockey team and forward Park Woo-sang said his team mates had proved their worth on the ice as well as their love for South Korea off it.
“We don’t think of them as naturalized players, we think of them as Korean players,” he told Reuters.
“You could say they are foreigners that love Korea more than Koreans themselves.”
With around 100 registered professionals in the country, South Korea needed all the help it could get just to secure an Olympic spot in a sport where the hosts are not guaranteed a berth.
Previous Winter Games hosts have also relied heavily on foreign-born players to bolster their ice hockey squads.
In 1998, Japan’s ‘Seven Samurai’ featured six Canadians and a Swede, while Italy had nine Canadian and two U.S.-born players in their 2006 squad.
While more of a factor at Summer Olympics, changing national allegiance has also become prevalent at the Winter Games.
Data from the Pew Research Center showed 120 of the 3,000 competitors in Sochi in 2014 represented a country other than the one in which they were born.
The IOC imposes a three-year wait period for athletes who want to switch but it has allowed them to cut short the process if their original Olympic committee and governing sports federation agree.
South Korea also has naturalized athletes in women’s ice hockey, figure skating, luge, biathlon and skiing set to compete in Pyeongchang, but not everyone is on board with the policy.
Roger Park, a professor at Hanyang University’s Sports Industry Department, said the practice could run counter to Olympics ideals.
“In most cases, (they) maintain their original citizenship and go back to their original country after the Games,” he told Reuters. 
“If they gain citizenship here solely to compete and earn a lot of money, it’s also against the Olympic spirit.”
Park also questioned the value of the medals they won.
”If these foreign athletes do not have any attachment for or  relation to South Korea, what is the point of them competing for the national team?
“If they leave South Korea after winning medals, can we still consider those medals earned by South Korean athletes?”
Several Korean sports federations contacted by Reuters said naturalized athletes were offered greater financial support than locals, but declined to elaborate on figures.
An official from the Korea Biathlon Union, which has four Russian-born athletes on its roster, told Reuters such athletes were in high demand.
“Internationally there is a kind of competition going on to attract athletes who are willing to be naturalized,” said the official, who did not wish to be identified.
Ice hockey association media officer Kim Jung-min, however, said no financial package was needed to persuade the players to take on dual citizenship as they were already playing on professional contracts.
Kim also rejected the notion that Korea was trying to “buy” a medal.
“Clinching qualification was our goal because that is still such a big thing for us,” he told Reuters. “Getting a medal at the Olympics is simply beyond our reach.”


(The Sports Xchange) - Highlights from National Basketball Association games on Thursday:
Celtics 99, Rockets 98
The Boston Celtics pulled off the biggest comeback of the NBA season on Thursday.
Down by 26 points early in the third quarter, Boston never led until Al Horford scored with 3.7 seconds left, escaping with a wild 99-98 victory that sent the Houston Rockets to their fourth straight loss.
Two straight offensive fouls in the backcourt resulting from James Harden knocking down Marcus Smart as Houston tried to inbound the ball with no timeouts left turned the game in the closing seconds.
Kyrie Irving paced the Celtics with 26 points. Harden led all scorers with 34 points but was only 7-of-27 from the floor.
Spurs 119, Knicks 107
LaMarcus Aldridge scored a game-high 25 points, and Pau Gasol added 17 points and 11 rebounds to rack up his fourth straight double-double as San Antonio rolled past New York.
All five starters scored in double figures for the Spurs, who won their straight game. Kyle Anderson, who started in place of Kawhi Leonard, scored 16 points, and Danny Green and Tony Parker hit for 15 and 14 points, respectively.

The Timberwolves were hitting at a 57.7 percent clip through three quarters but went 2 of 10 from beyond the arc and 4-of-19 overall in the fourth quarter.


(The Sports Xchange) - Highlights of National Hockey League games on Thursday:
Golden Knights 3, Kings 2
David Perron scored the winning goal at 3:30 of overtime as the Vegas Golden Knights defeated the Los Angeles Kings 3-2 on Thursday for their sixth consecutive win.
Vegas extended its point streak to 11 games (10-0-1), the longest of any team in its inaugural season. It is the first time in NHL history that an expansion team has won six games in a row.
Jonathan Marchessault and Brendan Leipsic registered the other Vegas goals. Marc-Andre Fleury made 26 saves.
Los Angeles lost its second straight game and has dropped five of its past seven. Marian Gaborik and Drew Doughty registered goals, and Jonathan Quick made 36 saves.
Capitals 4, Bruins 3 (SO)
Alex Ovechkin scored the only goal of the shootout, and Washington earned its 12th consecutive victory over Boston.
Ovechkin, the Capitals’ third shooter, made a move to his right and fired high over Bruins goaltender Anton Khudobin, off the post and in. Boston had won five straight while Washington snapped a three-game slide after overcoming a 2-0 deficit.
David Backes’ second goal of the night gave the Bruins a 3-2 lead at 7:19 of the third period, but the Capitals tied it on Brett Connolly’s eighth goal of the season during a scramble in front with 8:38 remaining. Backes and Noel Acciari scored early in the first period.
Lightning 3, Canadiens 1
Red-hot Tampa Bay tied the game with 12 seconds left in the second period and jumped ahead 30 seconds into the third to defeat Montreal.
The Lightning’s top two scorers combined on a highlight-reel goal -- Nikita Kucherov outskated a Canadiens defender to a loose puck and flicked a no-look backward pass to a charging Steven Stamkos, who beat Carey Price for the tying goal.
Tampa Bay, which is 10-0-1 in its past 11, took the momentum from that score into the third, when Brayden Point poked in a loose puck in front of the net for his 15th goal and a 2-1 lead with 19:30 left.
Maple Leafs 7, Coyotes 4
Patrick Marleau scored twice as Toronto defeated Arizona.
Mitch Marner recorded a goal and two assists, William Nylander had a goal and an assist, and Auston Matthews, Zach Hyman and Connor Brown also scored for the Maple Leafs. Marleau finished with a three-point night.
Jordan Martinook had a goal and an assist, and Josh Archibald, Brendan Perlini and Christian Fischer also scored for the Coyotes, who fell to a league-worst 9-26-5. Arizona has lost two of three, giving up at least six goals in each of the defeats.
Panthers 3, Flyers 2
James Reimer came within eight minutes of his second consecutive shutout as Florida won its fourth straight game.
Reimer, who made 29 saves in his 10th straight start in place of injured starter Roberto Luongo, has allowed just seven goals in his past four appearances. In a span covering parts of three games, Reimer went 121:54 without allowing a goal.
Jared McCann, Derek MacKenzie and Jonathan Huberdeau scored for the Panthers, and Nick Bjugstad picked up two assists. Huberdeau has 13 goals, one shy of Vincent Trocheck for the team lead.
Sharks 3, Flames 2 (SO)
Joe Pavelski and Joonas Donskoi scored the only goals in a shootout, lifting San Jose past Calgary for the Sharks’ third consecutive win.
Pavelski and Timo Meier scored for the Sharks in regulation, and Martin Jones made 32 saves. Jones stopped all three shots he faced in the shootout.
Garnet Hathaway and Mikael Backlund scored for the Flames. Backup goaltender David Rittich made 30 saves.
Canucks 5, Blackhawks 2
Thomas Vanek scored two goals and added three assists, and Sam Gagner added two goals and an assist as Vancouver beat Chicago.
Gagner extended his point streak to four games after producing points in only five of the previous 15 contests. His linemate, Brock Boeser, had a goal and three assists to take the NHL rookie points lead (38) from Mathew Barzal of the New York Islanders.


TOKYO (Reuters) - Prosecutors summarily indicted Mongolian-born former sumo grand champion Harumafuji for assaulting a junior wrestler, a local prosecutors office in Tottori, western Japan, said on Thursday, in a move to seek the payment of fines rather than a trial.
Harumafuji retired last month for injuring fellow Mongolian wrestler Takanoiwa while drinking at a restaurant-bar with other wrestlers in Tottori, an incident that has threatened to taint the image of Japan’s national sport just as it was regaining popularity.
The summary indictment was filed against the former “yokozuna” (grand champion) for causing a chop wound by hitting Takanoiwa on the head with a karaoke machine remote control, an official at the local prosecutors office said.
A report by the Japan Sumo Association’s crisis management committee has found that Harumafuji, angered that Takanoiwa was checking his smart phone after being chastised for a bad attitude by yokozuna Hakuho, slapped and hit the younger wrestler with a remote control device.
Following the summary indictment, Harumafuji’s lawyer released a statement on his behalf.
“Because of this incident, my life as Harumafuji is now set to be sharply different from what I thought it would be. I have a feeling of chagrin, to be honest. But the responsibility is all mine,” he said in the statement.
The incident has highlighted sumo’s struggle to reform harsh conditions that can breed violence in its closed, hierarchical world, although some wrestlers say there have been improvements in the decade since a trainee was beaten to death.


(Reuters) - Former world number ones Andy Murray and Novak Djokovic are relishing their return to competition after serious injuries cut their last campaigns short, but the overriding aim for both players in the New Year is to stay fit and healthy.
Murray, who has struggled with a persistent hip injury since the Briton’s quarter-final exit at Wimbledon in July, pulled out of the U.S. Open and dropped to 16th in the world rankings.
The 30-year-old is scheduled to participate in the Brisbane International which starts on Dec. 31 as he gears up for the Australian Open, but a season blighted by injury has changed the double Wimbledon champion’s outlook.
“When I was fit and healthy last year (2016), you think about winning all the major events, getting to number one and winning every competition that you are in and that is what drives you,” Murray told Sky Sports.
”When you miss four or five months and there has been a bit of uncertainty about my hip (that changes). The goals change and I remember now how much I loved playing tennis -- it isn’t about winning every match I play in the future or winning more slams.
“I want to get back to playing tennis, I want to be fit and healthy and that is what is driving me just now... I was pretty unhealthy for most of this year and I am getting there but it is a slow process.”
Djokovic suffered a year-long dip in form before an elbow injury forced him to retire in the Wimbledon quarter-finals. The Serb has not played competitively since and underwent surgery.
“It’s been a real roller-coaster ride for me for a year and a half with this issue,” world number 12 Djokovic told Sport360 in an interview ahead of his return at the World Tennis Championship in Abu Dhabi.
”I’ve never had surgery in my life, I’ve never had any major injuries that kept me away from the tour for such a long time... I’ve learned a lesson because I really want to avoid getting to that stage of an injury ever in my career after this.
“I can’t wait to get back on the competition level but it was a great experience for me to have. And it was a somewhat necessary experience because I got maybe too comfortable with not having major injuries.”


MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Australian super-maxi LDV Comanche was awarded line honors for the Sydney to Hobart bluewater classic on Thursday after an international jury imposed a one-hour penalty on Wild Oats XI following a protest.
Wild Oats smashed the race record when it crossed the line at Constitution Dock in Hobart at 9.48 pm (1048 GMT) on Wednesday after taking one day, eight hours, 48 minutes and 50 seconds to complete the 630-nautical mile (1,170 km) race.
Comanche, which had led for much of the race before both boats stalled in fickle winds on the River Derwent, finished just over 26 minutes later.
Comanche, however, had protested about a near collision between the two super-maxis when Wild Oats completed a tack about 15 minutes after the start in Sydney harbor.
The jury upheld the protest on Thursday and imposed a one-hour penalty on the Mark Richards-skippered Wild Oats, which had won the race eight times before.
“Wild Oats XI had to keep clear, failed to keep clear while tacking, Oats did not do turn,” race organizers said.
“Decision is penalized by one hour. Comanche is line honors winner.”
It was the first time a yacht had been stripped of line honors since Rothmans in 1990.
“I didn’t expect to protest in order to win the race, it was all about our actions to avoid a collision and the fact that was necessary,” Comanche owner Jim Cooney said.
”I feel the rules are there to protect people’s lives and if we can’t rely on that then there is a difficulty in the sport.
“It’s a great relief that all the effort of the crew the support crew and my family was vindicated, so it was a relief that we did deserve the win.”
Richards had told reporters earlier on Thursday he would have taken a 720-degree turn penalty at the time of the incident if they thought they were in the wrong.
“Everyone is a genius in hindsight,” Richards said after the decision when asked if he regretted not taking the turn penalty at the time. “We had spoken about ... but that was the decision we made and you have to live with it.”
Five boats in total, also including Black Jack, InfoTrack and Beau Geste, beat the previous record of one day, 13 hours, 31 minutes and 20 seconds.

Jets 4, Oilers 3
Winnipeg may have picked up a valuable two points with a victory over Edmonton, but it also lost offensive leader Mark Scheifele with a serious arm or shoulder injury.
After assisting on a goal, Scheifele was taken hard into the end boards. The Jets’ second-leading scorer fell awkwardly, immediately grabbed his right shoulder and writhed on the ice for about 30 seconds. He finally got up under his own power and went straight to the dressing room. He did not return.

Rangers 1, Capitals 0 (SO)
Mats Zuccarello and Mika Zibanejad scored during a shootout as New York defeated Washington.
Both backup goaltenders kept the game scoreless through regulation and overtime.
The Rangers’ Ondrej Pavelec turned aside 27 shots through the first 60 minutes, three more in overtime and two during the shootout. The Capitals Philipp Grubauer stopped 37 shots, including 18 in the third period and one in overtime. Grubauer was beaten on both of New York’s shootout attempts.
Bruins 5, Senators 1
Riley Nash scored his first two goals since Nov. 28 and added an assist, and Boston came out of the holiday break with a convincing victory over Ottawa.
Nash matched his career high for points in a single game. Tuukka Rask made 25 saves to go to 9-0-1 in his past 10 starts. David Backes and Danton Heinen both posted a goal and an assist, and Kevan Miller scored his first goal in 35 games, and defenseman Matt Grzelcyk had two assists for Boston.

The Devils’ Sami Vatanen collected an empty-net goal to close out the scoring in the final minute.
Penguins 5, Blue Jackets 4 (SO)
Evgeni Malkin and Sidney Crosby scored in a shootout as Pittsburgh overcame three two-goal deficits to beat Columbus.
The Penguins’ Jake Guentzel scored with 1:40 left in the third period to force a 4-4 tie. Conor Sheary, Phil Kessel and Malkin also scored for the Penguins.
Sonny Milano and Boone Jenner staked the Blue Jackets to a 2-0 lead in the first before leading scorer Artemi Panarin scored once in the second and once in the third.
Hurricanes 3, Canadiens 1
Sebastian Aho, the third member of Carolina to put a shot on goal in a five-second sequence, scored the winning goal against Montreal.
Aho’s go-ahead power-play goal came with 10:45 remaining. He added an empty-netter with 1:24 to play, giving him 10 goals this season. Teuvo Teravainen opened the scoring for the Hurricanes, who won six of their last seven games.

Kings 109, Cavaliers 95
Vince Carter scored 24 points in Sacramento’s improbable win over Cleveland.
The 40-year-old guard, who missed the team’s previous three games -- two by coach’s decision and one as a result of rib pain -- received multiple standing ovations from the Golden 1 Center crowd.

Timberwolves 128, Nuggets 125 (OT)

(Reuters) - Minnesota Timberwolves point guard Jeff Teague suffered a left knee injury during the fourth quarter of his team’s NBA game against the Denver Nuggets on Wednesday and will undergo a scan to discover the extent of the damage.
With less than a minute remaining in regulation play, Nuggets guard Gary Harris fell backwards into Teague’s knee causing him to limp off the court.
Minnesota recovered to eke out a 128-125 overtime victory, then announced that Teague would undergo an MRI scan on  Thursday.
Teague entered the game averaging 13.4 points and 7.2 assists for the Timberwolves (22-13), who are fourth in the Western Conference.


(Reuters) - Roger Federer did not know what to expect when he touched down in Australia in 2017.
The then 17-times grand slam champion was 35 and coming back from a first surgery-enforced absence to the sport he dominated for more than a decade from his maiden Wimbledon title in 2003.
The six months off, however, appeared to be positively cathartic as he provided arguably the major talking point of the tennis circuit by reviving a career that pundits thought could be over with the injury.
He beat Rafa Nadal in an epic final to win his fifth Australian Open crown and then clinched his eighth on the grass courts of southwest London to finish the year with seven titles and the world number two ranking.
However, Federer, who begins his 2018 campaign at the combined teams Hopman Cup tournament in Perth, recognizes that while expectations this year might be a little higher, he was trying to ensure they did not get out of control.
“Expectations are higher but at the same time I try to remind myself just don’t think its normal and realistic to aim for the same things I did this year in 2017,” he told reporters after he arrived in Australia.
”I’ve got to try and keep it cool. Try my best and see what happens but the preparation has been good so far.
“We’ll see how things go.”
Federer previously used the Kooyong invitational tournament to warm up for the Australian Open but returned to the Hopman Cup last year to team up with compatriot Belinda Bencic, where the pair finished second in their group.
“Obviously looking ahead to Melbourne, I really hope that Hopman Cup’s going to give me everything I need here,” Federer said of starting the season in Perth, where he and his 20-year-old partner will face Japan, Russia and the U.S. in group play.
”It worked out perfectly this year, (winning) at the Australian Open.
“Of course, that’s a good omen.”


(Reuters) - New Orleans point guard Rajon Rondo dished out an NBA season-high 25 assists on Wednesday against the Brooklyn Nets to become the first player to reach the total in 21 years.
Rondo delivered the 25 assists in just 30 minutes to help the Pelicans top the Nets 128-113.
Jason Kidd was the last player to achieve 25 assists back in 1996. The record for most assists in a single NBA game is held by Scott Skiles, who tallied 30 in 1990.
Rondo, who joined the Pelicans on a one-year deal in the off-season, put his passing skills on full display in helping four New Orleans players score more than 20 points on Wednesday.
The 31-year-old Rondo had a previous career-best of 24 assists.


SYDNEY (Reuters) - World number one Rafa Nadal’s preparations for next month’s Australian Open have suffered a blow after he was a late withdrawal from the Brisbane International tournament on Thursday.
The 31-year-old Spaniard has not played since he withdrew from the season-ending World Tour Finals in London in November with a knee injury. He had already withdrawn from an exhibition tournament in Abu Dhabi that starts later on Thursday.
“I am sorry to announce I won’t be coming to Brisbane this year,” Nadal said on his Twitter account.
“My intention was to play but I am still not ready after last year’s long season and the late start of my preparation.”
The Brisbane tournament was due to start on Sunday.
Nadal, who also canceled a training block last week, returned from injury last year to reach the final of the Australian Open and win the titles at the French and U.S. Opens.
He played in Brisbane last year as part of his preparations for Melbourne Park and made the quarter-finals before losing to Canada’s Milos Raonic.
“I had a great time there (in 2017) and it was a great start to the month I spent in Australia,” Nadal added.
“I will be seeing my Aussie fans when I land on the 4th in Melbourne and start there my preparation for the Australian Open.”
The Australian Open runs from Jan. 15-28.


(The Sports Xchange) - New England Patriots coach Bill Belichick insisted on Wednesday that he solely is focused on facing his team’s most immediate opponent, as opposed to a potential one.
The latter line of thinking stemmed from the Patriots signing free-agent James Harrison on Tuesday, perhaps to gain a bit of inside knowledge on the outside linebacker’s former team, the Pittsburgh Steelers.
“We’re playing the Jets this week. I don’t even know what that has to do with it,” Belichick said in his Wednesday morning news conference. “Maybe I‘m missing something, I don’t know.”
Pittsburgh quarterback Ben Roethlisberger said he has no ill will toward Harrison after the linebacker signed with the Patriots.
Roethlisberger, in fact, said that he wished the best for Harrison.
“James has to do what James has to do. It’s not like he called and asked me if he should or not,” Roethlisberger said.
“James was out there -- he’s a free agent, he has to do what’s best for him and his family. I wish him the best. I’ve had a lot of good years with him.”
The Steelers released Harrison on Saturday to make room for right tackle Marcus Gilbert, who was returning from a four-game suspension.
One day after being called a cancer on the team, Eli Apple was suspended by the New York Giants for the regular-season finale against the Washington Redskins.
Interim general manager Kevin Abrams said the second-year cornerback was suspended for “a pattern of behavior that is conduct detrimental to the team.”
According to multiple reports, Apple was angry that he was assigned to practice with the scout team. He got into an argument with cornerbacks coach Tim Walton and had to be restrained, according to NorthJersey.com.
Denver Broncos running back Jamaal Charles told reporters that he would like the team to release him so he could have a chance to latch on with a playoff team.
Charles hasn’t played as much as he expected after signing a one-year deal in May. That contract has a $900,000 base salary that could have been worth up to $3.75 million overall if the 31-year-old had reached all of the bonuses available in the contract.
Detroit Lions offensive tackle Emmett Cleary pledged to donate his brain to the Concussion Legacy Foundation to aid with research into chronic traumatic encephalopathy.
Cleary, 27, joins Cincinnati Bengals offensive lineman Eric Winston as active NFL players in pledging this year to donate their brains.
The awareness of CTE over the past decade has plagued the NFL as more and more accounts are shared publicly. The death of Hall of Famer Junior Seau in 2012 at age 43 just 2 1/2 years after his playing career ended was particularly alarming. Boston University has released three studies on CTE since July. In one study, test results on 111 brains of deceased former NFL players revealed evidence of CTE in 110.
Rookie Patrick Mahomes will start for the Kansas City Chiefs in their regular-season finale against the Denver Broncos, coach Andy Reid announced.
Mahomes will get first-team reps while traditional starter Alex Smith will work with the scout team this week for the AFC West champion Chiefs, who are locked in as the conference’s fourth seed.
Kansas City traded up from the 27th pick in April’s draft to take Mahomes with the 10th overall selection.
Minnesota Vikings coach Mike Zimmer said he expects quarterback Sam Bradford to return to practice next week.
Bradford injured his left knee in the season opener in New Orleans but didn’t come out of the game.
He hasn’t played since Week 5 at Chicago, where he was replaced by Case Keenum in the first half after aggravating the injury. He was placed on injured reserve on Nov. 8 and is eligible to return to the roster next week after sitting out the required eight weeks.
Indianapolis Colts coach Chuck Pagano had an interesting choice of words as his team prepares for its season finale.
“The last rodeo is what I told them,” Pagano said of his speech to players as the Colts (3-12) prepare to play Sunday’s season finale against the visiting Houston Texans (4-11).
“A picture of a guy on a bucking bronco with the spurs on it. It’s our last ride together.”


(The Sports Xchange) - Highlights of Monday’s National Basketball Association games:
Warriors 99, Cavaliers 92
Klay Thompson broke a late tie with a 3-pointer and Kevin Durant protected the lead with two key defensive plays on LeBron James, lifting the Golden State Warriors to a 99-92 victory over the Cleveland Cavaliers in the NBA’s marquee matchup on Christmas Day.
Neither team led by more than nine points in the tightly contested rematch of last spring’s NBA Finals, which the Warriors won in five games.
Durant, despite just 8-for-19 shooting, had 25 points to pace the Warriors, who have won six of their last seven at home against the Cavaliers.
Kevin Love had a game-high 31 points and 18 rebounds for the Cavaliers. James was held to 20 points on 7-for-18 shooting.
Sixers 105, Knicks 98
Joel Embiid had 25 points and 16 rebounds, and J.J. Redick added 24 points with four 3-pointers as Philadelphia snapped its season-high five-game losing streak.
Enes Kanter had 31 points -- including 14 in the third quarter -- and 22 rebounds, and Kristaps Porzingis added 22 points for the Knicks, who have lost three of four after winning four straight.
Ben Simmons, who struggled offensively and finished with eight points, had a crucial steal and breakaway dunk with 1 minute, 6 seconds left, jumping in front of a Porzingis pass and taking it the other way to give the 76ers an eight-point cushion. He then forced a turnover on New York’s next possession, and Philadelphia was able to juice the clock late.
Wizards 111, Celtics 103
Kelly Oubre Jr. and Bradley Beal both scored five straight points during a late 12-0 run, leading Washington past Boston.
It was the first time the Celtics played at home on Christmas, and they were fighting an uphill battle throughout the game. They wiped out an 11-point third-quarter deficit and led by five before the Wizards (19-15) caught fire.
Beal scored 25 points and grabbed eight rebounds and John Wall had 21 points, 14 assists and five boards. Kyrie Irving and Jayson Tatum led the Celtics with 20 points apiece.
Thunder 112, Rockets 107
Russell Westbrook scored 31 points to lift Oklahoma City over Houston.

Taj Gibson and Jimmy Butler scored 24 points apiece and Minnesota continued its best start in 14 years with a victory against Los Angeles.
Karl-Anthony Towns had 21 points and 10 rebounds and Jamal Crawford contributed 19 points off the bench for the Timberwolves, who shot a season-high 58.3 percent from the floor.


SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian super-maxi Black Jack was first out of the Sydney Heads after two of the leading contenders for line honors almost collided at the beginning of the Sydney to Hobart Yacht race on Tuesday.
The Mark Bradford-helmed Black Jack, which took line honors in 2009 as Alfa Romeo, was one second ahead of LDV Comanche at the first mark and kept its slim lead as the boats rounded the Heads at the harbor entrance and headed south to Tasmania.
Wild Oats XI, seeking a ninth line honors title, was third, about a minute behind the leading pair, but managed to overhaul Comanche as they raced along the New South Wales coast.
The trio were within sight of each other about two hours after the race started at 1 p.m. (0300 GMT).
Thousands of boats provided the perfect viewing positions for spectators as the 73rd edition of the 630-nautical mile bluewater classic got underway.
Despite the light conditions there was high drama shortly after the start when the Mark Richards skippered Wild Oats tacked too closely to Jim Cooney’s Comanche and they almost collided.
Race organizers had predicted steady north-east winds of up to 20 knots as the 102 yachts headed down the New South Wales coast with the breezes freshening to 25 knots as they approached Bass Strait between the mainland and Tasmania.
InfoTrack, which is the fourth super-maxi in the fleet, set the race record of one day, 13 hours, 31 minutes and 20 seconds when they took line honours last year as Perpetual Loyal.
Skippered by 2012 Olympic Laser class champion and 2013 America’s Cup winner Tom Slingsby, InfoTrack was fifth overall about two hours after the start of the race.
Covering approximately 630 nautical miles (1,170 km) of the Tasman Sea and notoriously treacherous Bass Strait, the grueling annual race is Australia’s premier yachting event.


(The Sports Xchange) - Highlights of National Football League games on Monday:
Eagles 19, Raiders 10
Jake Elliott kicked a 48-yard field goal with 22 seconds remaining and the Philadelphia Eagles clinched the No. 1 seed in the NFC and homefield advantage throughout the playoffs with a narrow 19-10 victory over the Oakland Raiders Monday night at Lincoln Financial Field.
Eagles quarterback Nick Foles looked shaky but improved to 2-0 since Carson Wentz went down with a torn ACL. Foles went 19 of 38 for 163 yards, one touchdown and one interception as the Eagles improved to 13-2 overall and 7-0 at home. The Eagles conclude the regular season on Sunday at home against the Dallas Cowboys.
The Eagles were also 13-2 in 2004 when they advanced to the Super Bowl.
Oakland quarterback Derek Carr finished 15 of 29 for 140 yards, one touchdown and two interceptions.
The Raiders, who had already been eliminated from playoff contention, fell to 6-9.
Steelers 34, Texans 6
Mike Hilton and Cameron Heyward recorded multisack games and the Pittsburgh Steelers remained in the running for home-field advantage throughout the AFC playoffs by breezing to a 34-6 victory over the Houston Texans.
Hilton and Heyward combined for five sacks of Houston quarterbacks T.J. Yates and Taylor Heinicke as the Steelers (12-3) limited the Texans (4-11) to 51 net passing yards.
Pittsburgh scored on its first two possessions and completed its road schedule with just one loss.
Pittsburgh clinched a bye in the postseason while extending its road winning streak to six.
Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger completed 20 of 29 passes for 225 yards and two touchdowns, including scoring strikes of five yards to Justin Hunter and 18 yards to JuJu Smith-Schuster.
Roethlisberger completed multiple passes to four receivers as the Steelers’ passing offense excelled in its first week without injured Pro Bowl receiver Antonio Brown.


MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko, banned for life from the Olympics this month, is temporarily stepping down from his role as head of the country’s Football Union, he said on Monday.
Mutko is to appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) on Tuesday against the decision by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to ban him from the Games over allegations of state-sponsored doping.
“For the period of the proceedings I will suspend my work at the Russian Football Union for six months,” Mutko was quoted as saying by Russian news agencies.
The IOC said this month it was banning Russia from the 2018 Pyeongchang Winter Olympics after finding evidence of “unprecedented systematic manipulation” of doping procedures..
Russia is hosting next year’s soccer World Cup in 11 cities including Moscow, St Petersburg and Sochi.
Mutko also said he was considering resigning as head of the World Cup’s organizing committee (LOC).
“FIFA understands Mr Mutko’s decision which was also taken in the best interest of the World Cup next summer,” the global soccer body said in a statement. “FIFA thanks Mr. Mutko for this responsible step and for the work carried out so far for the World Cup.”
FIFA added that Mutko’s decision “will have no impact on the successful staging of the World Cup next summer, as FIFA, the Russian Government, RFU and the LOC continue their fruitful cooperation on the preparations for the World Cup according to plan.”
Mutko sat on FIFA’s decision-making Council, previously known as the executive committee, from 2009 until earlier this year when he was barred from standing for re-election.
Mutko’s position as a government minister was ruled by FIFA’s review committee to be incompatible with FIFA statutes demanding political neutrality from its members.


(Reuters) - Yuzuru Hanyu will defend his figure skating title at the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics after being named in the Japan team but will not compete until then, the Kyodo news agency reported on Monday.
The 23-year-old has been battling an ankle injury since November when he fell while attempting a quadruple Lutz jump in practice and had to withdraw from the grand prix final in Nagoya earlier this month.
He has not competed since and will miss the Four Continents championships next month in Taiwan in order to make sure he is ready for the Winter Olympics, Japan Skating Federation director Yoshiko Kobayashi told Kyodo.
“Considering the time we have until the Olympics, (the JFA) believes that he can make a comeback,” Kobayashi said. “I hope he drives the young athletes as Japan’s ace.”
Hanyu has resumed training but is not practising jumps just yet, Kobayashi added.
Hanyu took gold at the Sochi Games in 2014 and is also the reigning world champion, which earned him selection for Japan’s Olympic team despite missing the national championships, which doubled as a qualifier, at the weekend.
The Winter Olympics run from Feb. 9-25.


(Reuters) - Seattle safety Earl Thomas courted controversy on Sunday when he appeared to offer his services to the Cowboys following the Seahawks’ 21-12 victory in Dallas.
Thomas, who attempted to enter the Cowboys locker room following the game, approached their coach Jason Garrett in the tunnel and could be heard saying, “if y‘all have the chance, come get me”.    The Texas native, who also played collegiate football at the University of Texas, has one year left on a five-year contract in Seattle and was asked about his post-game comments that are likely to anger the passionate Seahawks fans.
“I’ve always been a Cowboys fan growing up. The biggest thing when I said ‘come get me,’ I didn’t literally mean, ‘come get me now,'” Thomas, who added he was happy in Seattle, told reporters.
”I‘m still in the prime of my career, I still want to be here. But when Seattle kicks me to the curb, please, the Cowboys, come get me. You know?
“This is the place where I want to be when they kick me to the curb. So that’s what I meant.”
The victory kept Seattle’s slim playoff hopes alive.


(Reuters) - The NFL’s concussion protocol has been altered with late-season changes following recent incidents that have triggered investigations.
The changes were implemented last weekend, Dr. Allen Sills, the NFL’s chief medical officer, told ESPN.
Most notably, a central unaffiliated neurotrauma consultant (UNC) was stationed at the command center that has been used primarily for game-replay review, Sills said.
“We are constantly looking at the protocol and how it’s applied and trying to get better,” Sills said. “The process happens through the season.”
An injury to Houston Texans quarterback Tom Savage on Dec. 10 as well as Seattle Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson’s concussion protocol misstep in Week 10 that resulted in a $100,000 fine for the franchise were two incidents that fueled the investigation.
Other notable changes in the new protocol were:
--Any sign of impact seizure will be considered the same as loss of consciousness, with the player being ruled out of the game.
--A referee who removes a player from the game for suspected head trauma must notify the medical staff.
--A player who exhibits gross motor instability or significant loss of balance must be taken to the locker room for evaluation if it is not diagnosed as an orthopedic injury.
--A player who is evaluated for a concussion must be re-evaluated within 24 hours, even if the player has an off day.
--A third UNC will be on site for the playoffs and the Super Bowl, in addition to the two already assigned to each regular-season game.


(Reuters) - Twenty-three time grand slam champion Serena Williams will play her first match since the birth of her daughter when she faces off against French Open winner Jelena Ostapenko at the Mubadala World Tennis Championship in Abu Dhabi next week.
The match with be the 36-year-old Williams’ first in almost a year as she prepares to try to defend her Australian Open crown in January, a title she captured earlier this year while pregnant.
“I am delighted to be returning to the court in Abu Dhabi for the first time since the birth of my daughter in September,” Williams said in a statement on the championship’s website.
Williams and Ostapenko will be the first women to participate in the 10th edition of the Mubadala World Tennis Championship, which has long marked the beginning of the men’s global tennis season.
“I am excited and honored to be making my comeback as part of the first women to participate in the event,” Williams added.
The championship runs from Dec. 31 to Jan. 2.


(Reuters) - Benefiting from an off-season trade, Indiana Pacers guard Victor Oladipo is finally becoming the franchise player he was projected to be.
The 2013 top-two draft choice had been seen as ancillary to the deal when Indiana sent cornerstone Paul George to the Oklahoma City Thunder.
But Oladipo appears focused on proving his worth in a new lead role with the Pacers.
“I was already motivated before (the trade to Indiana), Oladipo told Reuters following a recent win over Atlanta.
“Then (the trade) just happened. It might have added on a little bit but I was already motivated.”
The fifth-year player has translated his motivation into career-best production as he averages 25.3 points per game on 48.6 percent shooting, which includes 42.5 percent from three-point range.
He adds five rebounds and nearly two steals a night.
The Pacers, who were expected to fall off a cliff in the absence of George, are holding steady at 19-14, the fourth best record in the Eastern Conference.
Oladipo has been particularly devastating in the month of December, erupting for scoring binges that included a 47-point night in a win against Denver.
Always known for his slashing athleticism and versatile defense, Oladipo has found a shooting comfort back in Indiana where he starred as a college player.
“He’s come into the season with confidence, and I think to prove himself,” said Pacers coach Nate McMillan who has enjoyed extensive film sessions with his new guard.
“There was a lot of conversation out there that the Pacers didn’t get enough in (trading away George). I think he’s proven to the league that he has talent.”
The Orlando Magic were intrigued by Oladipo’s talent when they drafted him as the second overall pick in the 2013 draft.
After three solid but not spectacular seasons with the Magic, Oladipo was shipped to the Thunder.
Playing alongside ball-dominant superstar Russell Westbrook, Oladipo had the role of unsung sidekick.
So when the Pacers landed Oladipo, expectations were low.
He is proving otherwise and appears headed for his first ever All Star appearance.
“We felt like he had potential and he’s showing that he did,” McMillan said. “He’s playing with confidence. And when you have that kind of ability and play with that kind of confidence, good things are going to happen for you.”

(Reuters) - Japan’s Kei Nishikori has withdrawn from the season-opening Brisbane International tournament as he continues to recover from a wrist injury, the event’s organizers have said.
The 27-year-old was ranked ninth in the world before sustaining the season-ending injury ahead of the Cincinnati Masters in August and has been out of action for more than four months, dropping to 22nd in the rankings.
Last month, Nishikori said he had chosen rehabilitation over surgery to repair the damage and was targeting a return in Brisbane, where he finished runner-up earlier this year, to warm up for the Australian Open.
“I am so disappointed to miss Brisbane this year. For years it’s been my first tournament of the season and I always feel so at home there...,” Nishikori was quoted as saying on the tournament’s official Twitter account.
Nishikori was among several top players who were forced to end last season early due to injury, including Andy Murray, Novak Djokovic and Switzerland’s Stan Wawrinka.
U.S. Open champion Sloane Stephens has also been ruled out of the women’s tournament at the Queensland Tennis Centre due to a knee injury.
“Sloane Stephens needs an extra week’s rehab on her knee, meaning she will now not play the Brisbane International. We look forward to seeing you next year instead, Sloane!,” the organizers said on Twitter.
The Brisbane International will be held from Dec. 31-Jan. 7.


(The Sports Xchange) - Highlights of Friday’s National Basketball Association games:
Clippers 128, Rockets 118
Austin Rivers caught fire in the second half and, with some help from Lou Williams, shot the short-handed Los Angeles Clippers past the Houston Rockets 128-118 on Friday night at Toyota Center.
Rivers scored 30 of his team-high 36 points on 10-of-18 shooting in the second half, drilling 5 of 10 3-pointers down the stretch to keep the injury-riddled Rockets (25-6) at bay.
Williams, traded by Houston in the offseason as part of the blockbuster Chris Paul acquisition, scored 32 points. Rivers and Williams combined to shoot 13 for 24 from behind the arc to offset another breathtaking performance from Rockets guard James Harden, who posted his second consecutive 51-point outing.
Harden finished 15 of 28 from the floor and 15 of 16 from the free-throw line while adding eight assists. Eric Gordon chipped in 28 points for Houston, which closed a season-long seven-game homestand with consecutive losses to the Los Angeles teams.

The NBA’s reigning MVP, Westbrook finished with 30 points and 15 rebounds. Carmelo Anthony finished with 24 points and Paul George scored 17 for the Thunder.

(Sports Xchange) - Oakland Raiders running back Marshawn Lynch was fined $24,309 by the NFL for yelling at an official near the end of Sunday’s game against the Dallas Cowboys.
An irate Lynch screamed at the sideline official after Oakland quarterback Derek Carr reached for the pylon for the go-ahead touchdown and fumbled the ball forward through the end zone.
The play was correctly ruled a Dallas touchback and the Cowboys took possession with 31 seconds left in their 20-17 victory.
Earlier this season, Lynch was suspended for one game after making contact with an official. Lynch also drew a $12,000 fine in September for raising both middle fingers during a game.
The Jacksonville Jaguars will attempt to clinch the AFC South title without wide receiver Marqise Lee, who was ruled out of Sunday’s game against the San Francisco 49ers with an ankle injury.
The Jaguars ruled out Lee on Friday and listed fellow wide receiver Allen Hurns as questionable, also with an ankle injury.
Lee, who leads the team in catches (56) and receiving yards (702), sustained his ankle injury in Sunday’s 45-7 rout of the Houston Texans. The 26-year-old also has three touchdowns receptions for the second straight season.
New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady diverted questions about the Boston Globe report that his personal trainer Alex Guerrero had several privileges restricted.
When asked his reaction after coach Bill Belichick told him that Guerrero wouldn’t be allowed on the sideline, Brady offered the following:
“I don’t really agree with your question, so I don’t know what you’re talking about. How do you know what he said?” Brady said.


(Reuters) - A New York jury on Friday found two former South American soccer officials guilty of taking bribes in exchange for the award of valuable marketing and media rights to international matches, the first trial verdicts in a U.S. probe of world soccer’s governing body FIFA.
Juan Angel Napout of Paraguay, former head of South American governing body CONMEBOL, and former Brazilian soccer chief Jose Maria Marin were convicted of corruption charges brought by U.S. prosecutors in 2015.
Marin was found guilty of six counts, including racketeering conspiracy, wire fraud and money laundering conspiracy. The jury cleared him on another count of money laundering conspiracy.
Napout was found guilty on three counts, including  racketeering conspiracy and wire fraud conspiracy. He was cleared on two counts of money laundering conspiracy.
The jury did not reach a verdict in the case against Manuel Burga, former president of the Peruvian soccer federation, and the judge said the jury should return on Tuesday to deliberate.
The three men were the first to stand trial on charges brought by U.S. prosecutors in 2015 as part of investigations that shook up FIFA.
“We are obviously disappointed but will continue to seek  justice for our client,” Marin’s lawyer, Charles Stillman, said in an email.
Silvia Pinera-Vazquez, a lawyer for Napout, declined to comment except to express disappointment with the verdict. Burga’s lawyer declined to comment.
In a statement FIFA said it was a victim of the alleged wrongdoing and “will now take all necessary steps to seek restitution and recover all losses.”
Prosecutors have charged 42 people and entities in the case, at least 24 of whom have pleaded guilty. Several of those testified for prosecutors in the trial, telling of corruption that went far beyond the three defendants in the courtroom.
Alejandro Burzaco, the former head of Argentine sports marketing company Torneos y Competencias, told jurors that he paid bribes to all three defendants to secure rights to matches including the Copa America and Copa Libertadores. Burzaco had pleaded guilty and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors.
Burzaco also said that Fox Sports, Mexico’s Grupo Televisa and Brazil’s Globo paid bribes for media rights to games. Fox and Globo have denied these allegations. Televisa declined to comment immediately after Burzaco’s testimony.
Burzaco also said that Qatar bribed officials of soccer’s world governing body FIFA to host the 2022 World Cup. Hassan al-Thawadi, secretary of Qatar’s Supreme Committee for Delivery & Legacy, which is organizing the 2022 World Cup, has denied the allegations.
“It is all hearsay and there is no evidence,” al-Thawadi said at a public event in November after Burzaco’s testimony, according to a representative of the committee. “We are confident in the integrity of our bid.”
Santiago Pena, a former financial manager at Argentine sports marketing firm Full Play, walked the jury through a spreadsheet detailing what he said were payments to eight CONMEBOL officials, including Napout and Burga.
The trial was marred by tragedy in its first week, when Argentine police said that Jorge Delhon, a former lawyer for the country’s Futbol Para Todos (Soccer for All), program had committed suicide after Burzaco named him in his testimony.
The next day, U.S. District Judge Pamela Chen put Burga under house arrest after prosecutors said he threatened Burzaco by making a slicing motion across his throat. She cast doubt on the cause of Delhon’s death, saying, “You can call it a suicide. The truth is none of us know that for sure.”
Burga’s lawyer, Bruce Udolf, denied that his client threatened Burzaco.


(Reuters) - Former world number one Tiger Woods said on Friday he has decided to end his working relationship with swing coach Chris Como, opting instead to fly solo in his latest comeback from injury.
Woods, who returned to competition three weeks ago after a near 10-month layoff during which he had spinal fusion surgery, began working with Como after a forgettable 2014 season during which injuries limited him to seven official PGA Tour events, missing the cut in two.
“Since my fusion surgery I have been working hard to relearn my own body and golf swing. I’ve done this by primarily relying on my feel and previous years of hard work with Chris,” the 41-year-old said in a statement posted on his official Twitter account.
“For now, I think it’s best for me to continue to do this on my own. I‘m grateful to Chris Como for his past work, and I have nothing but respect for him.”
Woods swung freely and with no sign of back pain at the Hero World Challenge, where earlier this month he began his latest comeback and finished tied for ninth in an 18-man exhibition that featured eight of the world’s top 10 golfers.
The 14-times major champion worked with swing coach Butch Harmon to begin his professional career, then switched to Hank Haney in 2004. Woods jumped to Sean Foley in 2010, whom he worked with for four years.
Como, in a statement provided to Golf Channel, said when he began working with Woods he was asked to help the golfer utilize his own instincts and feel while playing pain free and that he felt he accomplished the goal.
“Tiger is ready to have an incredible next run in his career. I‘m eager to watch what will be one of the most exciting sports comebacks of all time,” Como said in the statement.
“I will continue to be a close friend and resource to him and am extremely excited about Tiger’s future, the golf industry and for the fans of golf.”


ZURICH (Reuters) - The International Olympic Committee said on Friday it had banned 11 Russian athletes for life after they committed doping offences at the 2014 Sochi winter games.
Among them are speed skaters Ivan Skobrev, a two-time medalist at the Vancouver 2010 Games, and Artem Kuznetcov.
Along with lugers Tatyana Ivanova and Albert Demchenko, who both won silver medals in Sochi, cross-country skiers Nikita Kryukov, Alexander Bessmertnykh --both silver medallists-- and Natalia Matveeva, bobsledders Liudmila Udobkina and Maxim Belugin, and ice hockey players Tatiana Burina and Anna Shchukina, they were disqualified from the events they took part in.
They were also stripped of their medals and banned from future Olympic events, the IOC Disciplinary Commission said.
The decision is part of an IOC investigation into doping of Russian athletes at the 2014 winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia.
Earlier this month the IOC banned Russia from next year’s Pyeongchang Winter Olympics for what it called “unprecedented systematic manipulation” of the anti-doping system.
Investigations by the World Anti-Doping Agency and the IOC confirmed allegations of widespread doping among Russian athletes across many sports as well as tampering with Russian athletes’ samples during the Sochi 2014 winter Games.
The IOC, however, left the door open for Russian athletes with a clean history of non-doping to be invited to compete in Pyeongchang as neutrals.
“To date, the number of cases opened by the (IOC) disciplinary commission (for Sochi 2014) has reached 46 after additional findings from the re-analyses,” the IOC said. It has re-tested all of the samples from Russian athletes from those Games, banning dozens for life in recent months.
“All 46 of them have been handled, of which three have been filed. As some investigations are still ongoing (notably the forensic analysis of the bottles), it cannot be excluded that there might be new elements that would justify opening further new cases and holding more hearings,” it said.
The Pyeongchang Olympics run from Feb. 9-25 with Russian athletes competing under the Olympic flag as Olympic athletes from Russia (OAR).


ZURICH (Reuters) - World soccer body FIFA on Friday said it had awarded media rights for the 2018 World Cup to 2SPORT2 in Russia and Mediaset in Italy.
“In Russia, rights have been granted to the 2SPORT2 consortium (representing Channel One, RTR and Match TV), which will ensure comprehensive coverage of the competition in the host country,” FIFA said in a statement. “In Italy, Mediaset has secured live rights to all 64 matches to be aired on its free-to-air channels. The rights sales process in Italy was conducted by the MP & Silva agency on behalf of FIFA.”
The rights were platform-neutral, the global soccer body said, granting the media groups rights for TV, internet, mobile and radio coverage.


(Reuters) - U.S. broadcaster Dick Enberg, who charmed sports fans with his “Oh My!” declaration as he called some of the most memorable sporting events during the last five decades, died on Thursday, ESPN reported. He was 82.
Enberg was found dead at his home in San Diego. His wife Barbara told the San Diego Union-Tribune that her husband failed to catch a Thursday flight to Boston, where they were supposed to meet.
“He was dressed with his bags packed at the door,” she said. “We think it was a heart attack.”
Enberg worked for NBC, CBS and ESPN, calling some of the world’s biggest sporting events, including 10 Super Bowls, 28 Wimbledons and eight NCAA men’s basketball title games, according to ESPN.
Enberg was born and raised in Michigan and graduated from Central Michigan University, where he began his broadcasting career, ESPN reported. He moved to California and covered the UCLA Bruins basketball team, which won eight NCAA titles during his tenure.
“Sportscasting is a kid’s dream come true, which is one of the reasons that I keep doing it,” he said in his autobiography, according to the Los Angeles Times. “I can’t let my dream go. I‘m still love with what I do.”
In 1968, Enberg called what was dubbed the “The Game of the Century” between UCLA and the Houston Cougars, the first prime time NCAA regular-season game broadcast nationwide, according to ESPN. The Bruins’ 47-game winning streak came to an end that night.
“That was the platform from which college basketball’s popularity was sent into the stratosphere,” Enberg said about the game, ESPN reported. “That became a monumental event.”
Enberg was honored with awards from the National Baseball Hall of Fame, Pro Football Hall of Fame and the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. He also won 13 Sports Emmy Awards and a Lifetime Achievement Emmy.
His last job was calling San Diego Padres games, which he retired from in 2016.
“We are immensely saddened by the sudden and unexpected passing of legendary broadcaster Dick Enberg,” the Padres said in a statement released late on Thursday to the San Diego Union-Tribune.
Despite leaving the broadcast booth, he continued to work on his podcast “Sound of Success,” which last aired on Thursday with an interview of Andy Friendly, a TV producer and executive, ESPN reported.
“I am talking to broadcast royalty today, and I am thrilled to be doing it,” Friendly said, according to ESPN.

Baltimore Orioles closer Zach Britton ruptured his Achilles tendon during a workout and is expected to be sidelined at least four months.
Britton’s injury will require surgery on Thursday in California to be performed by Dr. Ken Jung.
Major League Baseball commissioner Rob Manfred defended the new Miami Marlins ownership group, in particular Derek Jeter, during an interview on ESPN radio.

(Reuters) - Major League Soccer is heading for the Music City after Nashville was revealed as its latest expansion club on Wednesday.
The city known more for country music than soccer was named the league’s 24th franchise by MLS Commissioner Don Garber during a news conference at the Country Music Hall of Fame, but a decision has not yet been made on when the team will begin to play.
“Nashville is a rising city with a passionate soccer fan base, a dedicated ownership group and civic leaders that truly believe in this sport,” Garber said in a statement.
“Nashville continues its ascent as one of America’s most dynamic communities, with its incredible energy and creativity. For us, that makes it a perfect place for MLS expansion.”
In January, MLS said Nashville was among 12 cities vying to secure a team in a league that began with 10 clubs in 1996. MLS said at the time that two expansion teams would be announced by the end of 2017 and begin playing in 2020.
The Nashville team, which will play in a new, 27,500-seat soccer stadium at The Fairgrounds, is owned by a group that includes the Wilf brothers who own the National Football League’s Minnesota Vikings.
Despite not having a team to call their own until now, the city of Nashville has embraced soccer in impressive numbers in recent years.
The CONCACAF Gold Cup match between the U.S. and Panama in July drew a crowd of more than 47,000. Later that month, a state-record 56,232 fans attended a game between Premier League clubs Manchester City and Tottenham Hotspur.
Nashville already has two major league sports franchises -- the Tennessee Titans of the NFL and Nashville Predators of the National Hockey League.


(The Sports Xchange) - The New England Patriots have stripped Tom Brady’s trainer of several team privileges, adding to the speculation of a rift between the trainer and coach Bill Belichick, according to a report in The Boston Globe.
The trainer, Alex Guerrero, reportedly is a close friend of Brady as well as his business partner. Guerrero helped the decorated quarterback launch the TB12 Center, where Brady and several other Patriots players have trained and received treatment since it opened in 2013.
The Houston Texans added offensive tackle and cancer survivor David Quessenberry to their 53-man roster.
Quessenberry, who was a sixth-round pick out of San Jose in the 2013 draft, was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin T-lymphoblastic lymphoma three years ago. He has not played in a regular-season game in his NFL career.
Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski was named the AFC Offensive Player of the Week for the second time in his career.
Gronkowski reeled in nine receptions for a career-high 168 yards in the Patriots’ 27-24 win over the Pittsburgh Steelers on Sunday. The 28-year-old has 64 catches for 1,017 yards and seven touchdowns in 12 games this season.
Former Carolina Panthers executive David Gettleman interviewed for the vacant New York Giants general manager position.


(Reuters) - Olympic gold medalist McKayla Maroney sued USA Gymnastics (USAG) on Wednesday alleging that the organization forced her to sign a non-disclosure agreement about sexual abuse she endured from former national team doctor Larry Nassar.
The lawsuit, filed by attorney John Manly in the Los Angeles Superior Court, a copy of which has been seen by Reuters, states that Maroney was forced to sign a confidentiality agreement in December 2016, because she needed money to pay for psychological treatment.
The suit alleges Maroney was sexually abused by Nassar from about 2009 to 2013 while she was a teenager. It seeks to invalidate the non-disclosure agreement and seeks unspecified damages.
USAG responded in a statement emailed to Reuters that the “concept of confidentiality was initiated by McKayla’s attorney, not USA Gymnastics.”
Maroney’s court filing states she was forced into the confidentiality agreement “after suffering for years from psychological trauma of her sexual abuse at the hands of Nassar, and in need of funds to pay for psychological treatment...”
This month, Nassar was sentenced by a U.S. District Court judge in Michigan to 60 years in prison on federal child pornography charges that grew out of a sex abuse investigation.
Nassar was the team physician for the Michigan State University gymnastics and women’s crew teams. He served as the USA Gymnastics physician through four Olympic Games.
Just months after Maroney signed the confidentiality statement, the lawsuit says, USAG “publicly discussed the exact same subject matter it sought to conceal...”
The Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday that USAG paid Maroney a $1.25 million settlement.
As well as USAG and Nassar, the lawsuit also names the U.S. Olympic Committee and Michigan State University.
A lawyer representing Nassar did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
USGA responded with a statement which says, in part: “In 2016, McKayla’s attorney at the time, Gloria Allred, approached USA Gymnastics, requesting that the organization participate in a confidential mediation process.”
”USA Gymnastics cannot speak to the mediation process, which is confidential and privileged under California law. The process culminated in a settlement agreement that included a mutual non-disclosure clause and a mutual non-disparagement clause.
“The settlement in 2016 was in accordance with state law, despite what has been alleged.  At all times, McKayla was represented by Allred, a California-based attorney, who actively negotiated and approved the settlement agreement signed by McKayla.”
Allred said she had no comment on the statement by USAG.
The USOC said in a statement it had first learned of sexual abuse by gymnastics doctor in 2015, and that USAG had indicated it was in the process of contacting law enforcement about the matter.


FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (Reuters) - Tennis star Venus Williams will not face any criminal charges in relation to a June fatal traffic accident she was involved in near her Florida residence, the Sun-Sentinel newspaper reported on Wednesday, quoting police.
The driver of a car that struck Williams’ SUV in an intersection was also not charged, after Palm Beach Gardens police determined that neither violated the right-of-way, the newspaper reported. Palm Beach Gardens police and city clerk did not immediately respond to inquiries.
Police had initially said Williams was to blame for failing to yield the right-of-way.
But by July, Palm Beach Gardens police said video evidence had surfaced that showed that Williams entered the intersection lawfully, and that a car not involved in the collision forced Williams to stop in the intersection. The traffic light changed, and a sedan that struck Williams’ SUV had a green light.
Jerome Barson, 78, who was a passenger in a sedan that collided with the SUV Williams was driving, died 13 days after the June 9 accident. His wife, Linda Barson, 68, was driving the sedan.
The Barson family has filed a wrongful death suit against Williams. Calls to attorneys for both parties were not immediately returned on Wednesday evening.


LONDON (Reuters) - Bristol City, from English football’s second-tier, pulled off a sensation in the League Cup quarter-finals as they knocked out the holders Manchester United 2-1 amid late and wholly improbable drama at their Ashton Gate home on Wednesday.
On one of the great nights in the Championship club’s 123-year history, City despatched the Premier League giants amid ecstatic scenes with a winner three minutes into stoppage time from Korey Smith.
City’s reward for their famous win was to earn a semi-final tie with runaway Premier League leaders Manchester City while  Chelsea, who also defeated Bournemouth 2-1 in a dramatic finish at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday, were later drawn to play Arsenal.
Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho, who saw his chances of winning a fifth League Cup ended, mixed praise for the victorious underdogs with the observation that they were also “lucky”.
“They played brilliantly, fought like it was the game of their lives which it probably was,” he said on Sky Sports.
“A beautiful day for football. A team from the lower division won. A big day for them.”
He had picked a much-changed but strong side with big guns Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Paul Pogba back in the starting lineup but United found it a trying night and could not complain when local hero Joe Bryan put City ahead with a superb 51st-minute strike.
Ibrahimovic, who like Marcus Rashford had hit the post for United in the first half, thundered home a low freekick to restore parity seven minutes later.
Yet City, who are third in the Championship and hunting promotion to the top-flight, kept believing.
They made United the fourth Premier League victims of their fairytale Cup run when, latching on to a fine chipped pass from substitute Matty Taylor, Smith took the ball expertly on his chest and swiveled to fire home left-footed in the final seconds.
“It’s an overwhelming feeling of pride, to beat Manchester United is incredible,” said City’s manager Lee Johnson, whose father Gary was once also a successful manager of the Robins.
“They are a special group. It has been a long time since we had a result like that at Ashton Gate. My dad always says he’s the most successful Bristol City manager so I have maybe pushed him close tonight!”
Johnson had bought a special 450 pounds ($601) bottle of wine that he wanted to share with Mourinho after the match -- but instead champagne was the order of the night.
Chelsea looked set to be comfortable winners over struggling Premier League opposition when Willian finished off a fine team move after just 13 minutes but Bournemouth rallied after the break.
Dan Gosling smashed home a deserved equalizer in the final minute but Chelsea launched an attack of their own almost straight from the restart with substitute Alvaro Morata snatching the winner within 40 seconds of Bournemouth’s goal.
The late drama at both matches ensured a fascinating last-four draw, with Chelsea playing Arsenal at Stamford Bridge in the first match of the two-legged tie in the week commencing Jan.8.
Bristol City will travel to the Etihad Stadium for their first leg against Manchester City, who are still unbeaten in domestic matches this season, before seeking another famous win at Ashton Gate in the second leg during the week of Jan.22.

LONDON (Reuters) - Nine times world rally champion Sebastien Loeb will make a limited comeback next season by racing three rounds of the world championship with Citroen, the French manufacturer said on Wednesday.
The 43-year-old Frenchman, who last raced in the world championship as a one-off in 2015 after retiring from full-time involvement in 2012, will compete in Mexico, Corsica and Catalunya.
“The feeling you get in rally is one of the most thrilling feelings I have ever experienced, and I was excited about driving one of these new WRCs in a race,” he said in a team statement.
“I don’t have any expectations, I just want to enjoy myself,” he added.
Northern Irishman Kris Meeke will contest the full 13 race season as Citroen’s lead driver while Ireland’s Craig Breen will enter 10 rounds.
Khalid Al Qassimi, from the United Arab Emirates, will appear in a third car at a handful of rallies due to other commitments including the Dakar Rally in January. Loeb will also be taking part in the Dakar with Peugeot.


ZURICH (Reuters) - Peru captain Paolo Guerrero will be able to play at the World Cup after FIFA’s appeal committee cut his ban for failing a doping test from one year to six months on Wednesday.
The reprieve for Peru’s all-time leading scorer is a huge boost for the South Americans, who have qualified for the World Cup for the first time in 36 years but are short on big-name players.
Guerrero, 33, who plays for Flamengo in Brazil, had been suspended by world governing body FIFA on Dec. 8 after testing positive for cocaine metabolite benzoylecgonine after Peru’s 0-0 draw away to Argentina in a World Cup qualifier in October.
The ban, backdated to start on Nov. 3, will now finish in May, just over one month before the start of the tournament in Russia.
“The FIFA Appeal Committee after taking into account all the circumstances of the case, in particular the degree of fault of the player, considered a six-month period of ineligibility to be a proportionate sanction,” said FIFA.
The former Bayern Munich and Hamburg SV forward, who has scored 42 goals for Flamengo since moving to Brazil in 2015, gives the Peru attack a much-needed physical presence and has a galvanizing effect on their less experienced players.
“We have reduced his ban to six months and now we are aiming to get him totally absolved,” Guerrero’s lawyer Pedro Fida told local television station Canal N.
“Guerrero’s case is not about the consumption of cocaine -- that has been completely discarded by FIFA. We will keep trying to prove his innocence.”
Guerrero has scored 32 goals for Peru, including a free kick against Colombia which gave them a 1-1 draw in their final South American group game and kept them in the competition.
Guerrero also helped Peru finish third in the 2011 and 2015 Copa Americas, was leading scorer in both tournaments and scored the winning goal when Brazilian club Corinthians beat Chelsea 1-0 in the Club World Cup final in 2012.
Peru, who reached the quarter-finals at the 1970 World Cup and the semi-final group stage in Argentina in 1978, face France, Denmark and Australia in their group.

MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Nick Kyrgios has sacrificed his love of basketball for more time in the gym to get fit for the Australian Open but sees no immediate need for the extra discipline of a full-time coach.
The 22-year-old Australian worked with Frenchman Sebastian Grosjean on a part-time basis this year but has yet to find a candidate with his “best interests” at heart, he told reporters in Brisbane on Wednesday.
“I haven’t got a coach and I think I‘m just going to go about my thing the same way that I did this year,” he said.
”I’ve pretty much done it all alone the last three years to get to a career high of 13.
”To bring someone on, it’s tough to know whether they’re just doing it for the sake of getting a bit of cash or rather have best interests at heart.
”I‘m not looking for someone who has a big name or anything, it’s more trying to find someone who has my best interests and I can confide in.
“So far I haven’t really met anyone that meets those requirements. I don’t think I‘m ready for a full-time coach just yet either.”
The mercurial talent’s world ranking has slipped to 21 after a season blighted by problems with his hip but said he was doing everything in his power to be in prime shape for Melbourne Park in January.
That has extended to less time playing his beloved basketball, which he blamed for causing a knee injury in the leadup to the 2017 tournament where he crashed out in the second round.
“I was playing a lot (of basketball) through the off-season but I know it’s not great on my body,” said Kyrgios.
“Especially training for tennis and playing that, it’s not the smartest. But you know, I’ll live.”
Kyrgios will warm up for the year’s first grand slam at the Brisbane International before heading to Melbourne to play in Tie Break Tens with Novak Djokovic, an exhibition of 10-point tiebreak matches.
“I feel like I’ve taken care of my body a bit more than last year,” said Kyrgios.
”Last year I wasn’t doing anything, I was kind of playing too much basketball.
“I had so many niggles going into the Australian Open. I feel like I’ve done everything I can. I’ve still got a lot of time to kind of find my feet.”


(The Sports Xchange) - Highlights of Tuesday’s National Basketball Association games:
Bucks 119, Cavaliers 116
Giannis Antetokounmpo’s three-point play with 5.9 seconds left capped a 27-point night and halted a furious comeback attempt as the Milwaukee Bucks snapped a three-game losing streak with a 119-116 victory over the Cleveland Cavaliers on Tuesday night at the Bradley Center.
LeBron James led the Cavaliers with 39 points but wasn’t on the floor in the fourth quarter as Cleveland used a 24-2 run to dig out of a deep deficit. Jeff Green and Dwyane Wade scored nine each in the final quarter, finishing with 13 and 14, respectively.
Eric Bledsoe had a big night for Milwaukee, scoring 26 points on 10-of-16 shooting, including two 3-pointers, as the Bucks made 11 of 29 from distance and shot 52.4 percent overall.
Wizards 116, Pelicans 106
Bradley Beal scored 22 of his 26 points during the second half of a game loaded with massive point swings as Washington outlasted New Orleans.
Mike Scott had 24 points on 11-of-15 shooting for the Wizards, who rebounded from Sunday’s 106-99 loss to Cleveland. John Wall finished with 18 points and 10 assists.

(The Sports Xchange) - The Pittsburgh Steelers lost a showdown to the New England Patriots for AFC supremacy on Sunday night, but they were atop the pack when it came to filling out the Pro Bowl roster.
Led by offensive standouts Antonio Brown and Le‘Veon Bell, the respective NFL leaders in receiving and rushing, the Steelers had a league-high eight selections for the 2018 Pro Bowl, which were announced Tuesday.
Quarterback Ben Roethlisberger, injured linebacker Ryan Shazier, kicker Chris Boswell and offensive linemen Alejandro Villanueva, guard David DeCastro and center Maurkice Pouncey filled out the roster for Pittsburgh, which is tied with the Patriots for the AFC’s best record at 11-3.
The Philadelphia Eagles, who own the league’s best record at 12-2, shared top honors in the NFC with the New Orleans Saints, each getting six Pro Bowl selections.
Eagles quarterback Carson Wentz, who leads the NFL with 33 touchdown passes but is done for the season due to a torn ACL, was joined by tight end Zach Ertz, defensive lineman Fletcher Cox, strong safety Malcolm Jenkins and offensive linemen Lane Johnson and Brandon Brooks among Philadelphia’s contingent.
New Orleans quarterback Drew Brees earned his 11th Pro Bowl selection and was joined by running backs Mark Ingram and Alvin Kamara, the latter one of four rookies on the squad.
Quarterback Tom Brady was selected to his 13th Pro Bowl and was joined by star tight end Rob Gronkowski on New England’s four-man contingent.
The Los Angeles Rams featured the fourth-most selections with five, with defensive lineman Aaron Donald earning his fourth selection and running back Todd Gurley receiving his second honor.
Rams quarterback Jared Goff is a first alternate on the squad and a likely replacement for Wentz. Goff and Wentz were the top two picks in the 2016 NFL Draft.
Rounding out the rookies were Kansas City Chiefs running back Kareem Hunt, Saints cornerback Marshon Lattimore and Arizona Cardinals special teamer Budda Baker.
Other notable selections were Cardinals wideout Larry Fitzgerald, who matched Brees with his 11th Pro Bowl berth, and Los Angeles Chargers quarterback Philip Rivers and Baltimore Ravens Terrell Suggs, who each earned their seventh honor.
Three other players were selected to their seventh Pro Bowls -- Cardinals cornerback Patrick Peterson, Cincinnati Bengals wide receiver A.J. Green and Patriots special teams standout Matthew Slater.


(The Sports Xchange) - Carolina Panthers linebacker Thomas Davis had his two-game suspension reduced to one game after an appeal, the NFL announced Tuesday.
Appeals officer James Thrash, a former NFL wide receiver, heard Davis’ appeal.
Davis will not play Sunday in Carolina’s home game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, but he can return to the active roster on Dec. 26. The Panthers conclude the regular season at Atlanta on Dec. 31.
Davis was suspended for his blindside hit Sunday that resulted in a concussion for Green Bay Packers wide receiver Davante Adams.
The 34-year-old Panther apologized to Adams over social media for the hit that followed an interception during the third quarter at Bank of America Stadium. Davis was penalized but remained in the game, which Carolina won 31-24.
Adams was left with a concussion and couldn’t talk with reporters following the contest because players in concussion protocol are barred from speaking to the media until they have been cleared.
That didn’t prevent Adams from speaking out on Twitter, however.
”I’ll never understand it,“ Adams wrote. ”Game is already dangerous enough and we got Pro Bowl players out here head hunting and saying they ‘didn’t mean to harm me.’
”Somebody please explain to me what I wasn’t trying to hurt him means when we nowhere near the play and u lead with ya head and ear hole a defenseless player....
”Look it’s football but no room for (expletive) like that. We supposed to be in this together n look out for one another not mess with a mans livelihood and hand out unnecessary concussions. We all got mouths to feed what if I did that to him and his kids can’t eat.
“Not the type to rant but when u go through this (expletive) twice in a year it takes a lil toll on u so excuse me.”
Adams’ words prompted an apology from Davis over social media.
“I understand your frustration and I do apologize for the hit!” Davis wrote. “In no way was I trying to hurt you. My first instinct was turn and make a block. In all sincerity I do apologize. I truly respect you as a player and I made a mistake!”


RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Former Brazil soccer striker and 1994 World Cup champion Romario said on Tuesday he plans to run for president of the scandal-plagued Brazilian Football Confederation (CBF) on an anti-corruption platform.
Romario, 51, now a senator who has led congressional investigations into corruption in Brazilian soccer, announced his intentions four days after CBF President Marco Polo del Nero was suspended for 90 days by soccer world body FIFA.
Del Nero is being investigated in Brazil for alleged unethical conduct. He and his two predecessors, Ricardo Teixeira and José Maria Marin, have been charged in the United States in the biggest corruption scandal in soccer’s history.
“No one has fought so vigorously against that gang than me, and so I am a legitimate candidate,” Romario said on Instagram. “I have the qualifications for the job. My credentials are my whole contribution to soccer, on and off the field.”
He blamed former FIFA President Joao Havelange, who died last year, for installing a “system” of graft in Brazilian soccer and beyond.
Romario called for the prosecution of Marin, Teixeira and del Nero at the end of a congressional inquiry he led last year into corruption in Brazilian soccer.
Romario helped Brazil win a record fourth World Cup title in 1994 in the United States.
His popularity won him a seat as a congressman and then senator for his home state of Rio de Janeiro. He has said he plans to run for governor of Rio to reform the financially bankrupt state.


(Reuters) - Nashville are expected to be named Major League Soccer’s (MLS) newest expansion franchise when commissioner Don Garber makes an “important announcement” in the Tennessee state capital on Wednesday.
Garber will appear alongside Tennessee state governor Bill Haslam, city mayor Megan Barry and the lead investor of Nashville’s expansion group, John Ingram, the league said.
MLS included Nashville on a short-list of four bidders for the two expansion teams that are scheduled to begin playing by 2020. The other three were Cincinnati, Detroit and Sacramento.
Nashville meets the three criteria deemed most important to MLS -- an approved stadium, a soccer-hungry public and an ownership group with deep pockets to cover the $150 million expansion fee.
The expansion group includes the Wilf brothers, who own the Minnesota Vikings of the National Football League (NFL).
The Nashville metro council last month voted to commit to bond funding for a new $275 million stadium.
Although Nashville has little soccer tradition, more than 56,000 attended an exhibition between English Premier League teams Manchester City and Tottenham Hotspur in July.
Nashville already has two major league sports franchises -- the Tennessee Titans of the NFL and the Nashville Predators of the National Hockey League (NHL).


(The Sports Xchange) - The New York Islanders were informed Tuesday that their proposal to build a new arena at Belmont Park just outside New York City was selected as the winning bid, according to a Newsday report.
The Islanders’ bid includes an 18,000-seat, year-round arena that would host 150 events annually as well as 435,000 square feet of space for retail, a hotel with 200 to 250 rooms and a 10,000 square-foot “innovation center” that would be developed with resident input, according to the report.
The team’s development partners include the Sterling Project Development, a real estate firm run by the New York Mets’ Wilpon family, and Oak View Group, an arena development company partially funded by Madison Square Garden.
A news conference is scheduled for Wednesday morning with New York Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo expected to be on hand.
The Pittsburgh Penguins acquired defenseman Jamie Oleksiak from the Dallas Stars in exchange for a conditional fourth-round pick in the 2019 NHL draft.
In a separate deal, Pittsburgh acquired goaltender Michael Leighton and a fourth-round pick in the 2019 NHL draft from the Arizona Coyotes in exchange for forward Josh Archibald, goaltender Sean Maguire and a sixth-round pick in that draft.
The Coyotes, in turn, sent former first-round pick Dylan Strome to Tucson of the American Hockey League. The 20-year-old Strome, who was the third overall pick of the 2015 NHL draft, has just one goal in 11 games this season.
Oleksiak has recorded one goal and two assists in 21 games this season with the Stars and accumulated 22 points (seven goals, 15 assists) in 140 career contests with the club.
The Columbus Blue Jackets assigned forward Tyler Motte to Cleveland of the American Hockey League, the team announced.


(The Sports Xchange) - Texas Rangers left-hander Martin Perez is expected to miss the start of the 2018 season after undergoing surgery to repair a fracture in his non-pitching elbow.
The surgery was performed by Dr. Thomas Diliberti in Dallas, with Perez expected to be able to start throwing in three to four weeks, the team announced Tuesday.
Perez is in line to be sidelined from game action for approximately four months, which would be a few weeks into the season. Perez posted a 13-12 mark with a 4.82 ERA in 32 starts last season.
Free-agent catcher Nick Hundley agreed to a one-year, $2.5 million contract to remain with the San Francisco Giants, the team announced.
Hundley, 34, batted .244 with nine homers and 35 RBIs last season while serving as Buster Posey’s backup.
Free-agent right-hander Yu Darvish posted on social media that he met with representatives from the Chicago Cubs on Monday.
Darvish, who is a four-time All-Star, tweeted a statement in Japanese confirming the meeting amid reports that Cubs president of baseball operations Theo Epstein and general manager Jed Hoyer were in Dallas to speak with him.
Darvish posted a 10-12 mark with a 3.86 ERA in 31 starts combined last season for the Texas Rangers and Los Angeles Dodgers. The 31-year-old struck out 209 batters over 186 2/3 innings.
Texas Rangers left-hander Cole Hamels and his wife, Heidi, have embraced the generous mood of the holidays.
The couple announced that it is donating a mansion located in southwest Missouri -- which is worth $9,418,400, according to Realtor.com, -- and the accompanying 100 acres of land to a charity that provides camps for children with special needs and chronic illnesses.


LONDON (Reuters) - Toyota will try again to win Le Mans next year and in 2019 after committing to another season of the world endurance championship.
The Japanese car maker had been considering its position after champions Porsche pulled out at the end of the 2017 season, leaving Toyota as the only major manufacturer in the top LMP1 category.
Toyota said in a statement on Tuesday, however, that it was committed to “at least” the 2018-19 season following publication of the regulations.
The ‘super season’ will last 14 months and includes two editions of the Le Mans 24 Hours sportscar race in June 2018 and 2019.
“It is highly regrettable that our rival in honing technologies on the roads of Le Mans has left,” said Toyota president Akio Toyoda.
“Yet the World Endurance Championship... and particularly Le Mans, where the battle goes on for 24 hours, including on public roads, still represent the optimal proving ground for achieving the goal of making cars fun for the next 100 years.”
The decision is a boost for double Formula One world champion Fernando Alonso, who tested with Toyota in Bahrain last month and is eager to race at Le Mans in his bid to become only the second driver to win the ‘Triple Crown’ of motorsport.
The McLaren driver entered the Indianapolis 500 this year, leading that race before retiring when his car’s Honda engine expired.
McLaren have ended their Formula One partnership with Honda, opening the door for Alonso to drive for Toyota at Le Mans -- a race that does not clash with any grand prix.
Toyota said it will announce the world endurance driver line-up early next year.
Only one Japanese manufacturer has ever won Le Mans, Mazda in 1991. Toyota have been five times runners-up and have spent hundreds of millions of dollars over the years in pursuit of victory at the French endurance classic.


BERLIN (Reuters) - Overall World Cup leader Mikaela Shiffrin confirmed her fine form this season, racing to victory in the women’s giant slalom at France’s Courchevel on Tuesday to tighten her grip at the top of the standings.
The American slalom specialist and Olympic champion, who hopes for more gold at the Pyeongchang winter Games in February, blew past the competition to finish almost a second ahead of her nearest rival, second-placed and home favorite Tessa Worley.
Italian Manuela Moelgg was third just before talented Norwegian Ragnhild Mowinckel.
Shiffrin, who skipped the World Cup event at Val D‘Isere last week, had notched her first career World Cup win in downhill at Canada’s Lake Louise earlier this month.
Germany’s Viktoria Rebensburg, second overall, and top of the giant slalom standings going into the race after winning the two previous ones this season, paid the price for two sloppy runs to finish in 14th.
The Pyeongchang Olympics in South Korea run from Feb. 9-25.


JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South African Paralympic gold medallist Oscar Pistorius has filed an application to the Constitutional Court seeking to overturn a higher prison sentence handed down by the appeals court last month, court documents showed on Tuesday.
Pistorius will appeal to the country’s highest court against the increased sentence of 13 years and five months, a murder term that the Supreme Court of Appeal more than doubled from an original six years for shooting dead his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp.


LONDON (Reuters) - World 100 meters champion Justin Gatlin said on Tuesday he was “shocked and surprised” at doping allegations made against his coach Dennis Mitchell, like Gatlin a convicted doper, but added that he had sacked him as soon as he heard about the issue.
Britain’s Daily Telegraph set up a sting where they claim  Mitchell, the American former medal-winning sprinter who was previously banned for doping, and sports agent Robert Wagner had offered to supply performance-enhancing drugs to undercover reporters claiming to be making a movie featuring a doped athlete.
Gatlin, 35, who won the world title in London this year against a backdrop of jeering relating to his two doping bans, issued a statement via Instagram where he said: ”I am not using and have not used PEDs (performance-enhancing drugs.
”I was shocked and surprised to learn that my coach would have anything to do with even the appearance of these current accusations. I fired him as soon as I found out about this.
“All legal options are on the table as I will not allow others to lie about me like this.”
The Athletics Integrity Unit and the US Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) have both said they are investigating the claims.
USADA said in a statement: “Investigations stemming from tips and whistleblowers play a critical role in anti-doping efforts. We are presently co-ordinating with the Athletics Integrity Unit in order to investigate these claims fully.”
The International Olympic Committee said on Tuesday: “The IOC has full confidence that WADA will look very carefully into this matter.”
The Telegraph quoted International Association of Athletics Federations president Seb Coe as saying: “These allegations are extremely serious and I know the independent Athletics Integrity Unit will investigate in accordance with its mandate.”
In a statement to the Telegraph, Mitchell, who confessed on oath to using banned substances during his career, said: “I never suggested in any way that any of my current athletes used any banned substances or that I was familiar with training any of my current athletes with those substances.”
Wagner also denied being involved in doping but said he “played along” in the sting because he knew what was going on.
Gatlin has been a divisive figure in the sport throughout his career, which brought him Olympic 100m gold in 2004 and a host of other global medals. He served two doping bans for offences he has always denied and after his second comeback, was widely painted by the media as the bad guy going up against the sport’s darling, Usain Bolt.
In August, in Bolt’s final individual championship race, Gatlin took the 100m gold at the World Championships in London, with the Jamaican finishing third.


(The Sports Xchange) - The Atlanta Falcons pulled within a game of the NFC South lead thanks to a 24-21 victory against the injury-plagued Tampa Bay Buccaneers on Monday night at Raymond James Stadium.
Tampa Bay kicker Patrick Murray was wide right on a 54-yard field-goal attempt as time expired.
The defending NFC champion Falcons (9-5) would win the division title if they defeat the New Orleans Saints (10-4) on Sunday and the Carolina Panthers (10-4) on Dec. 31.
The Bucs (4-10), who entered the game without three injured defensive starters, had six more players ruled out after getting hurt Monday night.
Falcons running back Devonta Freeman (22 carries, 126 yards) provided a 24-14 margin with a 32-yard touchdown run on third-and-2 with 7:58 remaining. The Bucs answered on Jameis Winston’s 16-yard pass to Adam Humphries with 4:07 to play.
From there, Tampa Bay eventually regained possession when Bucs defensive tackle Clinton McDonald dumped quarterback Matt Ryan for a 3-yard sack on third-and-9 just past the two-minute warning.
Winston completed three passes on Tampa Bay’s final drive, driving the Bucs from their 29-yard line to Atlanta’s 36, setting up Murray’s unsuccessful attempt to force overtime.
Winston completed 27 of 35 passes for 299 yards and three touchdowns in his most efficient effort of the season. Ryan was 17 of 31 for 212 yards and one score.
In the third quarter, the Bucs pulled within 17-14 on Winston’s 42-yard pass to Mike Evans, who outfought two defenders in the end zone. Tampa Bay preserved that three-point deficit when Will Gholston blocked Matt Bryant’s 33-yard field-goal attempt.
The Falcons led 17-7 at halftime, pulling away with a 10-point second quarter.
Atlanta gained its advantage when Freeman lost a fumble at the 1-yard line, but tight end Levine Toilolo recovered in the end zone for a touchdown.
The Bucs tried to answer back, but Peyton Barber lost a fumble at Atlanta’s 5-yard line and Falcons defensive tackle Dontari Poe recovered.
The Falcons tacked on a 57-yard field goal by Bryant with 3:12 remaining in the half for a 17-7 lead.
Atlanta opened the scoring with Ryan’s 6-yard pass to Justin Hardy.


(Reuters) - Salt Lake City officials expect the Utah capital to bid for the 2030 Winter Olympics and say it already has the infrastructure in place to host a low-cost Games, local media reported on Monday.
Fraser Bullock, co-chair of the city’s Olympic exploratory committee, told the Fox 13 television station the city could host the event at a cost of $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion, which would cover upgrades to venues used when the Games were held there in 2002.
That would be about $400 million less than it would cost cities that needed to build venues from scratch, he said.
“We have the venues built,” said Bullock, who was chief operating officer of the 2002 Olympics.
“We can economize in many ways to make that budget work.”
United States Olympic Committee CEO Scott Blackmun said earlier this month there were “significant challenges” associated with U.S. cities bidding for the 2026 Winter Games since it would come two years before Los Angeles hosts the Summer Games.
“We’re leaning more in the 2030 direction,” he said.
Reno-Tahoe, Denver and Salt Lake City had shown the most interest in hosting a Winter Games, he added.
Utah Governor Gary Herbert has also voiced support for bringing the Games back to Salt Lake City, where he said the bid enjoyed broad public support.


(Reuters) - Walt Disney Co’s (DIS.N) John Skipper resigned on Monday as president of ESPN, the company’s most important network, due to a problem with addiction.
"I have struggled for many years with a substance addiction," Skipper, who was also Disney Media Networks co-chairman, said in a statement. "I have decided that the most important thing I can do right now is to take care of my problem." (es.pn/2kgmnCb)
George Bodenheimer will be the sports network’s acting chairman for the next 90 days, ESPN said in a statement. He had been its president from 1998 to 2011 and executive chairman until May 2014.
An ESPN spokeswoman declined to comment on who may be considered as Skipper’s successor.
Skipper’s departure comes within a few days after Disney struck a deal to buy film, television and international businesses from Rupert Murdoch’s Twenty-First Century Fox Inc (FOXA.O) for $52.4 billion.
Skipper, who became ESPN president in 2012, has led the network to a series of long-term distribution agreements with major rights holders, including the National Basketball Association and Major League Baseball.
But ESPN has also struggled with subscriber losses and ratings declines. Last month, it said it would lay off about 150 employees.
Disney Chief Executive Officer Bob Iger, who extended his stay at the company through 2021 to oversee integration of Fox’s businesses, lauded Skipper’s candor and backed his decision.
Disney shares were down 0.2 percent at $111.09 on Monday afternoon.


(The Sports Xchange) - Pittsburgh Steelers wide receiver Antonio Brown isn’t letting his calf injury get him down.
Brown wrote on Twitter that the injury he sustained in the Steelers’ 27-24 loss to the New England Patriots was a “minor setback.” Multiple media outlets reported that Brown has a partially torn left calf and that the wideout is eyeing a return for the playoffs.
Carolina Panthers linebacker Thomas Davis was suspended two games by the NFL for his blindside hit that resulted in a concussion for Green Bay Packers wide receiver Davante Adams.
Davis is expected to appeal the suspension, multiple outlets reported.
The 34-year-old Davis apologized to Adams over social media for the hit following an interception during the third quarter of Sunday’s game at Bank of America Stadium.
The Carolina Panthers announced Monday that long-time executive Tina Becker will serve as Chief Operating Officer of the team in the wake of the scandal involving owner Jerry Richardson.
Becker will have full control of the day-to-day management of the organization, making her one of the highest-ranking females in the NFL.
The upheaval in the organization began when allegations of sexual misconduct arose against Richardson, who announced Sunday night that he is putting the team up for sale. That action came two days after the Panthers announced their investigation into Richardson’s conduct.
Dallas Cowboys running back Ezekiel Elliott returned to the team one day after Sunday’s 20-17 victory over the Oakland Raiders.
The goal was to stay in contention until Elliott returned from suspension, and the Cowboys have accomplished that. Elliott returns after sitting out the past six games for violating the NFL’s personal conduct policy, stemming from a July 2016 incident in which an ex-girlfriend accused him of domestic violence.
Before his suspension, Elliott ranked among the league rushing leaders with 783 rushing yards and 210 receiving yards. He found his stride in the four games prior to his suspension, too, averaging 126.5 yards a game while scoring six touchdowns (five rushing, one receiving).
Embattled Houston Texans coach Bill O‘Brien insisted that he will not quit or resign in his post.
Houston fell to 4-10 when it was pummeled 45-7 by the Jacksonville Jaguars on Sunday.
O‘Brien, 48, has one season remaining on his contract and there have been no discussions regarding an extension. Houston is 31-31 during O‘Brien’s four seasons. O‘Brien has a 1-2 coaching mark in the postseason.
The Arizona Cardinals haven’t scored a touchdown in their last 10 quarters and that helped prompt a change to quarterback Drew Stanton for Sunday’s game against the New York Giants.
Cardinals coach Bruce Arians announced the switch at his press conference Monday. Stanton, who is recovered from a knee injury, will replace Blaine Gabbert as the starter.
Stanton suffered the injury in Week 10. Gabbert started the past five games, with the Cardinals going 2-3. Arizona was eliminated from playoff contention with Sunday’s loss to the Washington Redskins.
Oakland Raiders standout left tackle Donald Penn will undergo season-ending foot surgery after being injured in Sunday’s game against the Dallas Cowboys.
Penn’s injury to his right foot will snap his streak of 170 consecutive regular-season starts dating back to his rookie season of 2007. Penn, a two-time Pro Bowler, will reportedly undergo surgery on Thursday.
Buffalo Bills wide receiver Kelvin Benjamin said that he will be undergoing surgery as soon as the season ends to repair the torn meniscus in his right knee.
Benjamin suffered the injury on Nov. 19 against the Chargers, sat out the next two games, and has now played in two straight. In those two games, he has only five catches for 58 yards and a touchdown, and against Miami it was clear that he was limited because he had tweaked the knee the week before in the snow game against Indianapolis.
The Tampa Bay Buccaneers are without three defensive starters for Monday night’s home game against the Atlanta Falcons.


(The Sports Xchange) - The Boston Red Sox re-signed free agent first baseman Mitch Moreland to a two-year contract through the 2019 season on Monday.
Moreland’s deal will reportedly pay him $13 million over two seasons with up to $1 million more in incentives, WEEI.com reports.
Moreland revealed after news broke of his re-signing that he underwent a scope on one of his knees to clean up a small meniscus tear, but that he is fully recovered now.
The 32-year-old batted .246 with 22 homers and 79 RBIs while playing in a career-high 149 games last season. Moreland owns a .252 batting average with 132 homers and 433 RBIs in 922 career contests with the Texas Rangers and Red Sox.
J.T. Realmuto reportedly wants to be part of the player exodus from Miami, as the Marlins catcher has requested a trade, according to multiple reports, after the new ownership began dismantling the team to slash payroll.
The group, which includes Derek Jeter, has already traded National League MVP Giancarlo Stanton to the New York Yankees, fellow All-Star outfielder Marcell Ozuna to the St. Louis Cardinals and two-time All-Star infielder Dee Gordon to the Seattle Mariners.
Outfielder Christian Yelich is also reportedly unhappy with the recent trades, according to ESPN. Yelich, 26, has four seasons remaining on his seven-year, $49.57 million contract but the club hasn’t been shopping him. He batted .282 with 18 homers, 81 RBIs and 16 steals last season, while the 26-year-old Realmuto set career highs of 17 homers and 65 RBIs last season while batting .278 in 141 games.
The San Diego Padres signed right-hander Jordan Lyles to a one-year contract with a club option for 2019.
Financial terms of the deal were not divulged by the Padres on Sunday, but FanRag Sports reported that Lyles will earn $750,000 in 2018.


(Reuters) - The Carolina Panthers have appointed Tina Becker as Chief Operating Officer (COO) with full control of the daily management of the National Football League (NFL) franchise, the team announced on Monday.
The Panthers said Becker, who started as a cheerleader, will be one of the highest-ranking female executives at an NFL team.
The news comes the day after owner Jerry Richardson said he would sell the team at the end of the season, amid allegations of workplace misconduct by the owner that are under investigation by the NFL.
Becker, who has been with the franchise since 1999 in a variety of positions, fills a post that had been vacant since team president Danny Morrison resigned earlier this year.
She acknowledged the turbulent times at the Panthers.
”These have been some of the most difficult days of my 19 years with the Panthers, but I am lifted up by the strong resolve and the commitment our employees have shown to this organization,” she said in a statement on the team’s website.
”Our team on the field is performing at a very high level, and I believe is bound for the Super Bowl.
“My immediate focus will be to ensure the corporate side of the organization performs at the same high level, while addressing the real concerns that have been raised in recent days.”
The Panthers are 10-4 with two games left in the regular season and are likely headed to the playoffs.


(The Sports Xchange) - The St. Louis Blues placed forward Jaden Schwartz on injured reserve with a right ankle injury and he will be re-evaluated in six weeks, the team announced Sunday.
Schwartz sustained the injury when he blocked a shot in the Blues’ 6-1 win over the Red Wings on Saturday in Detroit. He had to be helped off the ice after suffering the injury, which occurred late in the first period, and was not able to put any pressure on his right leg.
Schwartz, 25, did not return for the final two periods and the Blues said after the game that initial X-rays were negative. Before having to leave the game, Schwartz scored his 14th goal of the season.
The Vegas Golden Knights activated three-time Stanley Cup winner Marc-Andre Fleury from injured reserve and assigned fellow goaltender Maxime Lagace to Chicago of the American Hockey League.
Fleury has been sidelined since Oct. 14 with a concussion. The 33-year-old Quebec native recorded a 3-1-0 mark with a 2.48 goals-against average and .925 save percentage in four games this season.
Lagace owned a 6-6-1 record with a 3.79 GAA and .872 save percentage in 14 appearances this season. He recorded a career-high 36 saves in Vegas’ 5-3 win over the Dallas Stars on Saturday.
The Florida Panthers plan to retire No. 37 in honor of franchise founder and former owner H. Wayne Huizenga, the team announced.
Panthers owner Vincent Viola made the announcement on the 25th anniversary since the club was awarded a hockey franchise. The ceremony will take place on Jan. 19 at BB&T Center when the Panthers host the expansion Vegas Golden Knights.
The number was selected by the Huizenga family in recognition of Wayne’s birth year and lucky number.
The No. 37 will be the second number retired by the franchise and both honor front office members. In October 2010, the organization raised No. 93 to the rafters in honor of William A. Torrey, the former Panthers president and current special advisor to the general manager.
The Dallas Stars recalled forward Jason Dickinson from the Texas Stars of the American Hockey League.


LONDON (Reuters) - Manchester City beat Manchester United 2-1 at Old Trafford to go 11 points clear at the top of the Premier League on Sunday while Liverpool and Everton drew 1-1 in a snowswept Merseyside derby at Anfield.
City’s victory marked the first time a team have won 14 consecutive English top-flight games in the same season and ended United’s run of 40 home games unbeaten in all competitions.
Pep Guardiola’s side took the lead in the 43rd minute  through David Silva but poor defending allowed United to hit back immediately with Marcus Rashford grabbing an equalizer before the break.
Nicolas Otamendi volleyed in the winner on the half-turn nine minutes into the second half.
City now have 46 points from 16 games, with United staying second on 35, and look like the title is theirs to lose even if Guardiola was not about to get carried away.
“We won because we were better. We are still in December, if we have 11 points (lead) when we play the second derby in April then maybe I will tell you that we have the title,” said the Spaniard.
Champions Chelsea, who lost 1-0 at relegation-threatened West Ham United on Saturday, are third on 32 points with Liverpool squandering a chance to overtake them and staying fourth on 30.
Liverpool manager Juergen Klopp fumed after his side’s draw, with Everton’s former England captain Wayne Rooney equalizing from the penalty spot after a sensational first-half goal by Mohamed Salah.
“The other team was not even in our box, I don’t know if they had a shot on target apart from the penalty. To give them an open door like this, in my understanding, that’s not okay,” said Klopp.
“There are greater catastrophes on this planet than getting a point after a game like this but it feels not too good,” added the German.
Salah’s 42nd-minute stunner sent the Egyptian clear of Tottenham Hotspur’s England striker Harry Kane as the league’s top marksman with 13 goals. Kane had scored twice in a 5-1 victory over Stoke City on Saturday.
Rooney’s goal was his first in a Merseyside derby, a match he last featured in almost 14 years ago before moving to Manchester United.
“It’s always nice scoring against Liverpool, whoever you’re playing for,” he said.
In the day’s early match, Southampton and Arsenal also drew 1-1 with Charlie Austin putting the hosts ahead in the third minute at St Mary’s and Olivier Giroud heading in a late equalizer after coming on as a second-half substitute.
It was the 17th time Giroud had scored as a substitute for Arsenal, equaling Norwegian Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s record with Manchester United for most goals scored off the bench for a single club.
City dominated possession at Old Trafford, showing they have grit as well as class even if the performance was not a classic display of the manager’s attractive passing soccer.
Jose Mourinho’s team selection had suggested a more expansive approach, with Anthony Martial and Rashford supporting central striker Romelu Lukaku, but the Portuguese was left with a bitter taste.
“It is a significant distance,” he said of City’s lead, before being asked if his team could make it up.
“I don’t know. I know we can win next Wednesday (against Bournemouth).”
Like Klopp, Mourinho was also upset with the referee -- in this case for not awarding a penalty to his side in the 79th minute when Ander Herrera went down in the box under pressure from Otamendi.
“My first reaction is I feel sorry for referee Michael Oliver because he had a very good match but unfortunately he made an important mistake,” he said.
“The result was made with a big penalty not given... Michael was unlucky because it was a clear penalty.”


JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - India’s Shubhankar Sharma remained on course for his maiden European Tour victory as lightning, rain and hail forced the Joburg Open into a Monday finish.
Sharma, ranked number 462 in the world, has a tournament total of 22 under-par and holds a four-shot lead over South Africa’s Erik van Rooyen with 11 holes of his final round remaining.
Play will restart on Monday at 07h30 local time (05h30 GMT).
Sharma, 21, birdied the second and sixth holes on Sunday for a two under-par score in his final round, having now gone 44 holes since he last dropped a shot.
Van Rooyen remains in the hunt at four under-par from eight holes in his fourth round, and will have a three-foot putt on the par-four ninth to move to within three shots of Sharma when play resumes.
Tapio Pulkkanen of Finland and England’s James Morrison are tied for third at 14 under-par for the tournament, with 10 and 11 holes remaining respectively in their final rounds.
The top three finishers at the Randpark Golf Club, who are not already exempt, will earn a place at next year’s Open Championship at Carnoustie Golf Links.


VAL D‘ISERE (Reuters) - Six-times overall World Cup winner Marcel Hirscher defied difficult conditions to win the slalom at Val d‘Isere on Sunday.
The Austrian, who broke his ankle in pre-season training in August but now looks fully recovered, was only eighth fastest after the first leg in heavy snow and poor visibility.
But the 28-year-old bounced back to produce a perfect second run and win with a combined time of one minute 41.94 seconds, 0.39 seconds ahead of ahead of Norway’s Henrik Kristoffersen while Andre Myhrer of Sweden was third.
Twenty-four skiers fell victim to the conditions as they failed to complete the first run.
Hirscher’s second World Cup win of the season, following his giant slalom victory at Beaver Creek one week earlier, lifted him to second in the overall standings behind Kristoffersen.


ST MORITZ (Reuters) - American Lindsey Vonn pulled out of Sunday’s Super G World Cup race at St Moritz, saying she needed to take care of herself in the run-up to the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics in two months’ time.
The race itself was later called off due to bad weather.
Vonn, the finest woman skier of her generation, was treated for nearly one hour following Saturday’s race on the same course after suffering what she described as an  “acute facet (spinal joint) dysfunction.”
She said her back “seized up” near the sixth gate and, although she completed the course, she crumpled after the finish line and was clearly in enormous pain.
“Unfortunately I will not be able to race today,” she said on Twitter.
“I am extremely disappointed but my biggest goal this season is the Olympics and I need to take care of myself now so I can be ready for next week, and more importantly, for February.”

Spurs 104, Suns 101
LaMarcus Aldridge scored 20 points and Bryn Forbes hit a three-pointer with 21.5 seconds left as short-handed San Antonio posted a win over Phoenix.
Trailing by 19 points in the third quarter, the Suns got back into the game with a 26-9 run and took their first lead of the game at 100-99 on a Marquese Chriss runaway slam with 1:19 left.
But after Josh Jackson made one of two free throws to extend the lead to two, Patty Mills found Forbes alone in front of the Spurs bench for his first made three-pointerin six tries to give San Antonio the lead for good.

(Reuters) - Vasyl Lomachenko retained his WBO super-featherweight title with a sixth round technical knockout of Guillermo Rigondeaux in New York City on Saturday, the impressive Ukrainian handing the Cuban-born American his first professional defeat.
The highly-anticipated duel between a pair of double Olympic champions resulted in an anti-climatic finish, however, when Rigondeaux, citing a hand and wrist injury, told the referee that he did not want to continue prior to the seventh round.
All three judges had Rigondeaux, who moved up two weight divisions for the bout, behind when he quit in front of a disappointed Madison Square Garden crowd, making it the fourth consecutive Lomachenko fight in which his opponent has retired.
Lomachenko, the 29-year-old heavy pre-fight favorite, defended his title for a fourth time and improved his career record to 10-1 (eight TKOs), including seven knockouts.
The 37-year-old Rigondeaux (17-1), who was warned by the referee several times for foul play, began telling his trainer after the third round that his left hand and wrist hurt.
“This is not his weight so it’s not a big win for me,” Lomachenko, who won gold medals at the Beijing and London Olympics, told reporters. “But he’s a good fighter, he’s got great skills. I adjusted to his style, low blows and all.”


TORONTO (Reuters) - Jozy Altidore’s second half goal helped propel a relentless Toronto FC to a 2-0 victory over the Seattle Sounders on Saturday to claim their first Major League Soccer championship after a gut-wrenching loss in last year’s final.
The victory capped a superb season for the Reds, adding the MLS Cup to the Supporters’ Shield that goes to the club with the best regular-season record and the Voyageurs Cup as Canadian champions.
Everything they accomplished this season, however, including a regular season points record, mattered little beyond getting back to the final and avenging their loss on penalties to Seattle last year.
“This trophy has been an obsession for the last 364 days not just for me but every single guy on our team, every coach, every member of our staff,” Toronto FC captain Michael Bradley told reporters.
”To get back here, to give ourselves another crack at it has been, honestly there is no other word for it, other than obsession.
“It’s hard to describe to people outside what it has been like to live that every day.”
The victory did more than exorcise the demons from a year ago, it also went some way towards restoring the pride of a franchise whose reputation had been one of failure rather than excellence.
Toronto, who played their first season in 2007, did not reach the postseason until 2015 – the longest playoff drought in league history.
“It has been a long time, a long journey to get here and heartache along the way as we saw last year but it’s been an incredible journey,” said Toronto coach Greg Vanney, who had also lost three previous finals with the Los Angeles Galaxy.
While Toronto had dominated the final from the outset, Seattle goalkeeper Sebastian Frei was in imperious form as the home side peppered him with shots.
Altidore, who scored the only goal in the Eastern Conference final against the Columbus Crew, finally beat Frei when he ran onto a through ball from Sebastian Giovinco, outpaced the defense and coolly slotted a shot past the goalkeeper.
It was the first goal conceded by the Sounders in this year’s playoffs.
“It’s my job, I‘m a striker it is my job to create and try to score goals,” said Altidore, who was named man of the match. “Night’s like this is what it is all about.”
Victor Vazquez then added a second into injury time lighting the fuse on wild celebrations for the capacity crowd of 30,584 who had braved the chilly conditions.
“This team, this year is like nothing I have ever been a part of just in terms of a group guys so single minded,” said Bradley.
“To cap it off tonight the way we did, to play the way we did with everything on the line I‘m so proud.”


(The Sports Xchange) - New England quarterback Tom Brady on Saturday put to rest any talk of a rift between himself and Patriots offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels.
During the 23-3 win over the Bills last Sunday in Buffalo, McDaniels and Brady exchanged words and the New England quarterback stormed off the field animated while continuing to bark at McDaniels.
“I want to apologize to Josh for last week in Buffalo,” Brady told reporters Saturday. “I know the coaches work really hard. They’re responsible for putting us in a great position to succeed. So I just want to get that off my chest.”
Brady was 21-of-30 passing for 258 yards en route to his 27th career victory over the Bills as the Patriots won for the eighth straight time.
Several members of the Pittsburgh Steelers, including wide receiver Antonio Brown, will honor injured teammate Ryan Shazier on Sunday.
Brown posted a short video on Snapchat Friday of the customized cleats he intends to wear during warmups prior to Sunday night’s game against the Baltimore Ravens.
One yellow cleat features Shazier’s face, while the other has a picture of a lion, which Shazier has used on social media on numerous occasions. Both cleats have Shazier’s name and number (50) on them, along with the hashtag “#SHALIEVE.”
Shazier underwent spinal stabilization surgery Wednesday after sustaining a severe injury against the Cincinnati Bengals on Monday night. The 25-year-old spent Monday and Tuesday night at the University of Cincinnati medical center before being transferred to Pittsburgh on Wednesday.
Geno Smith Jr., father of New York Giants quarterback Geno Smith, said he received a death threat last week before his son started in place of a benched Eli Manning.
Smith Jr. told NJ Advance Media that he received the call a little more than an hour after it was announced that his son would replace Manning for last Sunday’s game against the Oakland Raiders.
“I was just at work,” Smith Jr. told NJ.com on Friday. “I answered, and he was like, ‘Geno?’ So I just listened, and he was like, ‘Is this Geno?’ I was like, ‘Yeah.’ He was like, ‘Your son better not start or we’re going to kill you.’ I kind of just laughed and then he hung up.”
The 43-year-old Smith Jr. told NJ Advance Media that he was sitting in his car monitoring workers removing debris as part of FEMA’s disaster relief efforts in Miami and Broward County when he received the threatening call from a man he said sounded in his late 20s. He said the phone number had a Missouri area code.
The Cincinnati Bengals placed cornerback Adam “Pacman” Jones on injured reserve, the team announced.
The 34-year-old Jones injured his groin while making a diving interception of Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger in Monday night’s 23-20 loss. He was ruled out of the game in the first quarter and did not practice this week.
Jones finished his 11th NFL season and eighth for the Bengals with 23 tackles, one interception and four passes defensed in nine games, all starts. He also was one of the team’s kick and punt returners.
Dallas Cowboys linebacker Justin Durant, defensive lineman David Irving and cornerback Orlando Scandrick were downgraded from questionable to out for Sunday’s game against the New York Giants.
Durant will be missing his second straight game because of a concussion.
Irving has seen limited time this year, but when he has played, he has been a destructive force. He missed the first four games after being suspended for violating the NFL’s ban on performance-enhancing drugs, but has compiled 22 tackles and seven sacks (second on the team).


(Reuters) - A family-like atmosphere helped the Los Angeles Angels win the frenzied battle to sign Japanese ace Shohei Ohtani, the team’s general manager Billy Eppler said on Friday.
Ohtani’s decision to join the American League West division team over several bigger franchises that courted him might have surprised some, but he could become the latest piece of the puzzle needed to elevate his new employers into the playoffs.
“I think he felt that there was a family-like atmosphere with the Angels and something that he was wanting to and willing to be a part of for a lot of years to come,” Eppler told Los Angeles radio station KLAA 830 AM.
“I think it was his comfort level with us and not only just the plan that we put together for him, but just the overall vibe of the organization.”
The pitcher and slugger, who played for the Nippon Ham Fighters in Japan, will join Garrett Richards in the starting rotation and provide danger at the plate on a team that includes MVP sluggers Mike Trout and Albert Pujols.
Ohtani was the most coveted free agent in the off-season after announced he would leave the Hokkaido-based NPB (Nippon Professional Baseball) team and move to Major League Baseball.
The 23-year-old pitches right-handed has a stellar 2.52 earned run average (ERA) in five seasons in the Japan big leagues, and his arsenal includes a 100 miles-per-hour (162 kph) fastball and an excellent slider.
The left-handed batter hit .332 in 2017 and has slugged 48 home runs in 1,035 career at-bats.
He is widely expected to slot into the batting line-up in games when he is not pitching, but Eppler declined to go into specifics.
“The most important participant in the plan, it’s going to be Shohei,” he said.
“It’s going to be how he is accustomed to developing and how he is accustomed to his own workload management. He’s going to really be an active participant in this plan.”
Ohtani joins a team that went 80-82 in the 2017 season and has reached the playoffs just once in the past eight seasons.

Matt Niskanen scored the go-ahead goal with 3:32 remaining, Tom Wilson and Nicklas Backstrom each added a goal and an assist, and the Washington Capitals defeated New York.
Wilson’s goal gave Washington a 4-2 lead with 1:32 left. Backstrom and Jay Beagle also scored for the Capitals, who have won four straight and seven of their last eight.
Michael Grabner and Jesper Fast scored for the Rangers in the first meeting of the season between the Metropolitan Division rivals.
Golden Knights 4 Predators 3 (SO)
Reilly Smith’s goal in the sixth round of a shootout Friday gave the Vegas Golden Knights a 4-3 win over the Nashville Predators at sold-out Bridgestone Arena.
Vegas forced overtime at 19:20 when, with a sixth skater, Erik Haula ripped a one-timer from the right circle for his 10th goal of the season.
Nashville had gained its first lead at 14:56 of the third period off a turnover from Shea Theodore.
Viktor Arvidsson took the puck and fed Nick Bonino, who had plenty of time and space in the slot to wire a wrister home for his sixth goal of the season.
Arvidsson brought the Predators even at 8:04 of the third with his 10th goal, poking the rebound of Kevin Fiala’s shot past a prone Malcolm Subban.
Blackhawks 3, Sabres 2 (OT)
Gustav Forsling scored the winning goal with 4.9 seconds remaining in overtime to lift Chicago over Buffalo at the United Center.
Alex DeBrincat and Tommy Wingels also scored for the Blackhawks, who erased a one-goal deficit with 3:22 remaining in the third period.
Forsling finished with a goal and two assists to help Chicago snap a five-game winless streak.
Jason Pominville and Kyle Okposo scored for the Sabres, who picked up a point by taking the game to overtime but fell short against Chicago for the 12th game in a row.
Blue Jackets 5, Devils 3
After losing to New Jersey on Tuesday, Columbus rebounded to end a two-game skid with the help of a five-point game from Artemi Panarin.
With the score tied 3-3 early in the third period, Alexander Wennberg came through with only his second goal of the season, snapping a 17-game drought, at 1:32. The goal was just Columbus’ eighth all season on the power play.
Zach Werenski put the game away, scoring a four-on-four goal at 15:02 to make it 5-3. Panarin had the primary assist on all five Columbus goals, tying franchise records for most points and assists in one game.
Wild 3, Ducks 2 (OT)
Matt Dumba scored the winning goal 3:43 into overtime and Devan Dubnyk registered 26 saves as Minnesota defeated Anaheim.
The Wild came back from a 1-0 deficit but blew a 2-1 lead in regulation. The win snapped a three-game road losing streak.


(The Sports Xchange) - Highlights of National Basketball Association games on Friday:
Pacers 106, Cavaliers 102
Victor Oladipo scored 33 points to help the Indiana Pacers top the Cleveland Cavaliers 106-102, snapping their league-leading 13-game winning streak.
The Pacers made 15 3-point shots. Oladipo made 6 of 13 treys. Myles Turner added 15 points for Indiana.
LeBron James paced the Cavaliers with 29 points on 12-of-22 shooting and also had 10 rebounds and eight assists. Kevin Love added 20 points and J.R. Smith 15 for the Cavs.
The Pacers shot 44.2 percent (38 of 86) overall while the Cavs were at 43 percent (37 of 86).
Warriors 102, Pistons 98
Kevin Durant had a season-high 36 points to go with 10 rebounds, seven assists and five blocks and Golden State won its sixth straight.
Durant came up a few assists shy of a second consecutive triple-double after a 35-point, 11-rebound, 10-assist performance at Charlotte on Wednesday.
The Warriors became the 11th team in league history to sweep a six-game road trip.
The last team to achieve that feat was the Los Angeles Lakers during the 2008-09 season.
Golden State was playing its second straight game with two-time MVP Stephen Curry, who will miss at least two weeks with a right ankle sprain. Avery Bradley’s 25 points led the Pistons, who have lost five straight.
Nuggets 103, Magic 89
Reserve Kenneth Faried scored 20 points and grabbed 10 rebounds in leading Denver over Orlando.
Will Barton had 19 points and six rebounds, and Emmanuel Mudiay had 18 points. The Nuggets snapped a four-game losing streak.
The Magic lost forward Aaron Gordon, the team’s leading scorer, in the second half with a concussion, which stemmed from a first-half collision with Denver’s Gary Harris.
Harris and Malik Beasley each had 12 points. Wilson Chandler had 11 points. Nikola Vucevic led the Magic with 21 points and 17 rebounds. Jonathon Simmons scored 21 points.
Bulls 119, Hornets 111 (OT)
Lauri Markkanen scored 24 points and Chicago snapped a 10-game losing streak with an overtime win over Charlotte Hornets.
Markkanen scored five points in the extra session, and his 3-pointer with 2:08 remaining made it 113-108 and was probably the key basket of the game. The Bulls had not won since beating the Hornets in Chicago on Nov. 17.
Kris Dunn had 20 points and 12 assists for the Bulls. Robin Lopez finished with 19 points and 10 rebounds, and Justin Holiday scored 17. Markkanen also had 12 rebounds.
Kings 116, Pelicans 109 (OT)
Zach Randolph scored 35 points, including a back-to-back 3-pointers to open overtime, to lift Sacramento over New Orleans.
The Kings trailed 100-91 with 3:31 left in regulation, but they ran off eight consecutive points to close within 100-99 with 1:06 left. Buddy Hield made a 3-pointer and a layup in that stretch.
A dunk by DeMarcus Cousins with 49.5 seconds left put New Orleans up 102-99, but Hield, who scored 18 points, tied the game with a 3-pointer from the right wing with 34.8 seconds remaining.
Jrue Holiday missed in the lane for New Orleans, and Randolph missed a baseline jumper on the final two possessions, sending it to overtime.
Raptors 116, Grizzlies 107
DeMar DeRozan scored 26 points as Toronto rallied to defeat Memphis for its fifth straight.
Serge Ibaka scored 21 points and Kyle Lowry finished with 16 points, eight assists, six rebounds and two steals for the Raptors. DeRozan added seven rebounds and six assists.
Tyreke Evans led the Grizzlies with 27 points. Marc Gasol finished with 20 points, seven rebounds and four assists. Chandler Parsons had 15 points, four rebounds and two blocks off the bench.
Bucks 109, Mavericks 102
Khris Middleton scored 31 points, Giannis Antetokounmpo finished with 27 and Eric Bledsoe added 24 as Milwaukee fought off Dallas.
Middleton made five 3-pointers -- including two in the fourth quarter -- while the Bucks’ big three combined to make 24 of 54 shots from the floor.
Wes Matthews led Dallas with 29 points and had five of Dallas’ 10 3-pointers, but the Mavericks had no answer for Middleton or Bledsoe as the duo combined for 27 points in the fourth quarter.
Spurs 105, Celtcis 102 (OT)
Manu Ginobili canned a 26-foot 3-pointer with 5 seconds to play to lift the San Antonio Spurs to a 105-102 victory over the Boston Celtics in a game between two of the NBA’s heavyweights at AT&T Center.
The game was tied at 102 after a basket by the Spurs’ LaMarcus Aldridge with 1:32 to play.
Two Kyrie Irving misses on 3-pointers, an Aldridge turnover and a miss on a 3 by San Antonio’s Rudy Gay that Ginobili gobbled up on the baseline with 25.8 seconds to play set the stage for Ginobili to drill his game-winner.
After two timeouts, Irving had a good look for the tying basket from the baseline, but his trey went halfway down and out and was corralled by the Spurs as the final buzzer sounded.
Aldridge scored 27 points and grabbed 10 rebounds for the Spurs (18-8), while Pau Gasol hit for 14 points and 11 rebounds for San Antonio.
Gay added 15 points, and Tony Parker and Ginobili tallied 11 each for the Spurs, who have won three straight and seven of their past eight games.


(Reuters) - Rory McIlroy has announced he will play at least seven events in early 2018 in a busy build-up to the U.S. Masters, where he will attempt to complete the grand slam of major titles in April.
McIlroy said on his website (www.rorymcilroy.com) that he would start his campaign with two European Tour events in the Middle East in January -- the Abu Dhabi HSBC Championship and Dubai Desert Classic.
The Northern Irishman will then switch his focus to the PGA Tour in the United States, where he will contest five tournaments in six weeks, starting at Pebble Beach in February.
His schedule, notably, includes no mention of the World Golf Championships-Mexico Championship, which falls in the middle of his busy stretch.
All of the events will be part of his preparation for the April 5-8 Masters at Augusta National, an event he needs to win to complete the modern grand slam of all four majors.
Former world number one McIlroy is currently having an extended break from competition after an injury-hampered 2017 during which he did not win a tournament anywhere in the world for the first time since 2008.
The four-times major winner also sacked long-time caddie J.P. Fitzgerald and replaced him with close friend Harry Diamond, who is expected to stay on the bag, according to media reports.
McIlroy, 28, has slipped to 10th in the world rankings.
He faces an important season as he attempts to keep pace with the wave of young talent such as Jordan Spieth, Justin Thomas and Brooks Koepka, who all won majors this year.


VERSAILLES, France (Reuters) - Britain’s Lewis Hamilton was handed the Formula One world championship trophy for the fourth time on Friday at a gala prizegiving ceremony in the sumptuous palace of France’s former monarchy.
With Formula One chairman Chase Carey looking on, newly-re-elected International Automobile Federation (FIA) president Jean Todt handed the 32-year-old Mercedes driver the silverware he won in Mexico with two races to spare.
“This has been an amazing year,” Hamilton told the audience of champions and FIA members gathered in the palace’s 18th century opera.
“I hope that next year’s an even better year for all of you. I know for me that I‘m going to try to do better.”
Hamilton won nine of 20 races in 2017 and set an all-time record of 72 career pole positions as well as scoring points in every grand prix.
Asked earlier for his highlight of the season, Hamilton singled out his home British Grand Prix at Silverstone because of the support he received after the ‘negativity’ surrounding his failure to take part in an earlier London event.
He had also told reporters that while he did not like going to award ceremonies, or being on stage, he enjoyed watching others succeed.
Mercedes won both championships for the fourth year in a row but team boss Toto Wolff said 2017 had been particularly difficult.
“We keep it now,” he said after being handed the constructors’ trophy by Carey.
Red Bull’s 20-year-old Dutch driver Max Verstappen beat a field that included Hamilton and his own Australian team mate Daniel Ricciardo to the ‘Personality of the Year” award for the third successive year.
The award is selected by permanently accredited media from all FIA championships.
“I always try to be honest and straightforward so I guess that gave me the personality again this year,” said the winner of two races in 2017.
“It was a hard season but I learnt a lot from it.”
Monaco’s Formula Two winner and 2018 Sauber F1 driver Charles Leclerc won the Rookie of the Year award while Finnish rally driver Esapekka Lappi won the ‘Action of the Year’ for a jump in the Rally of Portugal.
British teenager Billy Monger, who had his lower legs amputated after an horrific smash in a Formula Four race at Donington Park in April, was presented with an FIA president’s special award.
Monger, who has already returned to driving, walked out onto the stage on prosthetic legs to a resounding ovation.


(The Sports Xchange) - Japanese two-way star Shohei Ohtani has agreed to sign with the Los Angeles Angels, his agent said Friday.
The Angels won Ohtani’s services over competition from the Chicago Cubs, Texas Rangers, Los Angeles Dodgers, San Diego Padres, San Francisco Giants and Seattle Mariners.
Ohtani was put up for bid by the Pacific League’s Hippon Ham Fighters for the maximum $20 million posting fee. He had until Dec. 22 to agree to a major league deal.
The Angels had $2.315 million of international bonus pool money to spend toward Ohtani’s offer.
Ohtani, who throws right-handed and bats left-handed, plans to be both a pitcher and an outfielder with the Angels. He went 42-15 with a 2.52 ERA in five seasons as a pitcher in Japan, and batted .286 with 48 homers and a .500 slugging percentage.
The St. Louis Cardinals and San Francisco Giants both announced that they agreed to deals to acquire Miami Marlins slugger Giancarlo Stanton but the National League MVP declined to waive his no-trade clause.
The Cardinals and Giants both targeted Stanton from the time that new Marlins ownership -- led by Derek Jeter -- made it known they wanted to move Stanton to help slash payroll. There is a guaranteed $295 million remaining on Stanton’s contract.
The announcements came on the same day that news leaked that the New York Yankees are among Stanton’s preferred choices. He also likes the idea of playing for the Los Angeles Dodgers.
The Giants and the Cardinals were originally viewed as co-favorites to land Stanton.
The Detroit Tigers agreed to terms with right-hander pitcher Mike Fiers.
The deal is for one year and $6 million, according to reports.


(The Sports Xchange) - Cleveland Browns owner Jimmy Haslam introduced new general manager John Dorsey on Friday and said the team “absolutely” complied with the NFL’s Rooney Rule that requires NFL teams to interview at least one minority candidate.
The winless Browns shook up their front office Thursday, first firing executive vice president/general manager Sashi Brown, then hiring Dorsey as the new GM.
Dorsey made a significant move immediately. The Browns waived wide receiver Kenny Britt just one season into a four-year, $32.5 million contract signed in the offseason. Britt has 18 receptions for 233 yards and two touchdowns this season.
Dorsey was fired by the Kansas City Chiefs in June after a four-season run as general manager. He previously worked in the front offices of the Green Bay Packers and the Seattle Seahawks. He received a four-year contract from the Browns.
The quick move to hire Dorsey raised questions from John Wooten, head of the Fritz Pollard Alliance, over whether the Browns violated the Rooney Rule, which calls for at least one minority candidate to be interviewed for general manager and head coach openings. A league spokesperson confirmed to USA Today on Friday that the Browns did not violate the Rooney Rule.
New Orleans Saints coach Sean Payton is still fuming over what he called “extremely poor” officiating in Thursday night’s loss to the Atlanta Falcons.
The NFL is reviewing Payton’s behavior toward the officiating crew after he drew an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty late in the fourth quarter, according to ESPN. He has not talked to anyone yet in the league office following the Saints’ 20-17 loss.
Payton’s frustrations during the game carried over to Friday when he expanded on his issues with the officials during a teleconference.
“I thought the officiating was extremely poor,” Payton said. “Inconsistent would be a great way to put it, and I thought that had a lot to do with the way this game ended. It’s frustrating when you have a game, instead of it being decided on the field like it’s supposed to, you have a crew make so many mistakes in one event.”
The Saints lost six players to injuries during Thursday’s game, and quarterback Drew Brees sounded off after the game, saying the reason is “100 percent a product of playing on Thursday night.”
New Orleans lost running back Alvin Kamara and guard Senio Kelemete with concussions; linebacker A.J. Klein and safety Kenny Vaccaro with groin injuries; defensive end Trey Hendrickson with an ankle injury; and wide receiver Ted Ginn Jr. with an unspecified injury.
“It’s 100 percent a product of playing on Thursday night,” Brees told reporters after the game.
Former New York Giants running back Rashad Jennings announced he is retiring after eight seasons in the NFL.
The 32-year-old Jennings wrote on Twitter: “If good things don’t come to an end, then how can better things begin? I‘m truly humbled. I‘m truly excited... More to come on this. But for now, I just want to say THANK YOU. Thank you to everyone! #ShadHumbled.”
Jennings finished with 3,772 rushing yards, 1,469 receiving yards and 25 touchdowns in a career that began with the Jacksonville Jaguars in 2009 as a seven-round draft pick.
Detroit Lions quarterback Matthew Stafford is listed as questionable for Sunday’s game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers due to a bruised right hand.
Stafford threw more passes in Friday’s practice after throwing none on Wednesday and only light tosses on Thursday.
Stafford has started 108 consecutive games, the third-longest current streak among NFL quarterbacks.
The Cincinnati Bengals ruled out six starters for Sunday’s game against the Chicago Bears, including five on defense.
In Monday night’s physical 23-20 loss against the Pittsburgh Steelers, linebacker Vontaze Burfict, cornerback Dre Kirkpatrick and running back Joe Mixon all sustained concussions, while cornerback Adam Jones injured his groin in the game.
Linebacker Nick Vigil (ankle) and safety Shawn Williams (hamstring) had injuries prior to Monday night’s game and also were ruled this week.
Arizona Cardinals running back Adrian Peterson will miss Sunday’s game against the Tennessee Titans due to a neck injury, coach Bruce Arians told reporters.
It will be the second straight game Peterson has missed.
Oakland Raiders receiver Amari Cooper returned to practice on Friday and is listed as questionable for Sunday’s game against the Kansas City Chiefs.


(Reuters) - Tommy Horton, a two-times Ryder Cup player and a stalwart of the European Tour, has died at the age of 76.
Horton died in hospital shortly after falling ill on Thursday, the European Tour said on Friday.
The Briton won four times on the European Tour and represented Great Britain and Ireland against the United States in the 1975 and 1977 Ryder Cups.
The Englishman’s best finish in a major was equal fifth at the 1976 British Open won by Johnny Miller.


TORONTO (Reuters - Ever since David Beckham ended his playing career in 2013 it has become a Major League Soccer tradition that commissioner Don Garber is asked during his annual state of the league address about the former-England captain’s effort to bring a franchise to Miami.
With the league pushing ahead with expansion plans and set to decide on two new franchises at meetings in New York next week, Garber was again quizzed on Friday about the status of a team, which seems no closer to taking the pitch than it was nearly four years ago when he began the pursuit.
This season Atlanta and Minnesota joined MLS and next year LAFC will become the league’s 23rd franchise.
The original timeline has long had Miami penciled in as the league’s 24th club but Garber conceded on Friday that one of the two franchises from Detroit, Cincinnati, Sacramento and Nashville being looked at for expansion could step to the front of the line.
”It’s conceivable that could  happen,“ said Garber, ahead of Saturday’s MLS Cup final between Toronto FC and Seattle Sounders. ”This is the most complicated situation in any market we have experienced at least in my 18 years.
”Part of it has been complicated by the Miami market, generally it is a difficult sports market. The second part of that is that it is one of the fastest growing value markets as leads to their real estate.
“Third it is their political structure, there is a variety of different mayors all for the same space.”
The major stumbling block for Miami Beckham United, the team’s working title, has been finding financing and land for a stadium.
After failed attempts to secure land in the downtown waterfront area the Beckham group settled on the Overtown neighborhood of Miami as the site for a 25,000-seat soccer specific stadium.
In June the Beckham group acquired a parcel of land needed for their project and Garber said on Friday that the proposed franchise had cleared another hurdle when an appeal that could have blocked progress was turned down.
“We’ve needed to get a finalization of the land, the lawsuit on that land was just settled when the appeal was turned down last week and we  have been working hard to try to find a local owner for David Beckham,” said Garber.
According to Forbes the average price of a MLS franchise is currently set at $225 million.
Beckham, however, is getting a major discount.
As part of the blockbuster deal that lured Beckham from Europe to the Los Angeles Galaxy in 2007 the league gave the option to purchase a franchise for $25 million.
“I feel confident that it will come together,” said Garber. “I continue to say we want Miami in the league, it is a large market, a gateway city there is a lot of value to us having a team down there and I am confident we will get something done.”


CLEVELAND (Reuters) - Ohio’s threatened lawsuit to prevent a Major League Soccer (MLS) team from leaving the state is unlikely to be successful in court, legal experts say.
State Attorney General Mike DeWine said on Thursday that his office is prepared to use a never-before-applied law to block Anthony Precourt, majority owner of the Columbus Crew, from moving the MLS franchise to Austin, Texas.
Legal experts say such an effort would likely violate federal commerce law.
The federal government, not states, has exclusive rights to “regulate national business such as a sports leagues,” Matt Mitten, executive director of National Sports Law Institute of Marquette University Law School, said in a telephone interview late on Thursday.
“The U.S. Constitution gives the Congress exclusive authority to regulate interstate commerce,” he added.
In a statement on Thursday, team spokesman Tim Miller said the team “has great respect for the office of the Ohio attorney general, however, there is nothing to address as Crew SC prepares for the 2018 season.”
The Ohio statute, passed the year after the 1995 announcement of the move of the National Football League’s Cleveland Browns to Baltimore, requires any professional team that receives financial support from the state to give at least six months’ advance notice before moving and to allow the city or local individuals the opportunity to purchase the team before any move.
Precourt announced the possible Crew move in an October letter, citing a “growing disparity in attendance and corporate support compared to (the team‘s) MLS peers and other mid-sized markets.”
Much like the Browns’ move, the suggestion has left fans and local officials shocked and angry.
Columbus Mayor Andrew Ginther responded to the possible move with an offer of a new stadium, but remained frustrated at the lack of response from team officials.
“Great American cities do not get into bidding wars over sports teams to benefit private owners,” he said in a statement in November.
But Ginther may have few options to keep the Crew beyond financial incentives.
It is difficult, if not impossible, to use legal means to force a sports team to remain in a city once its lease with a host city has expired, according to Mark Conrad, director of the sports business program at Fordham University’s Gabelli School of Business.“Even if the law was constitutional, it is wholly impractical and unlikely to prevent a team from relocating,” Conrad wrote in an email on Friday.
“The key to keeping a team at a facility is the lease. Once it expires, there is little the owner can do to force the team (or any business) to stay,” he added.
Other host cities and officials have tried a number of legal efforts over the years to stop professional sports teams from moving, but without success, Mitten said.
“It is basically a ‘Hail Mary,'” Mitten said of the threat.


MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian Olympic Committee President Alexander Zhukov said competitions should be organized for Russian athletes who decide not to compete at the 2018 Pyeongchang Winter Games, R-Sport news agency reported on Friday.
The International Olympic Committee (IOC) on Tuesday banned Russia from the Pyeongchang Games after evidence emerged of an “unprecedented systematic manipulation” of the anti-doping system, but left the door open for clean athletes to compete as neutrals.
“We need to hold alternative competitions for the athletes who decide not to go to the Olympic Games,” R-Sport quoted Zhukov as saying. “But we also need to support those who decide to go.”
Zhukov, who did not provide further detail about the possible nature of those competitions, added that it was “unacceptable” to accuse Russian athletes who decide to compete at the Olympics of being unpatriotic.
President Vladimir Putin said this week that Russia would not prevent athletes from competing at the Games if they wanted to, damping down calls by some Russians for the country to boycott.
Russia is expected to make a final decision on its stance regarding the IOC ban at a meeting of the country’s Olympic authorities next week.
Russian authorities have vehemently denied any state support for doping and have pledged to co-operate with international sports bodies to counter the use of banned performance-enhancing drugs.
The speaker of the Russian parliament, Vyacheslav Volodin, told lawmakers earlier on Friday that they should not attend the Pyeongchang Games if Russian athletes are not competing under the country’s flag, local news agencies reported.
In the weeks ahead of Tuesday’s IOC decision, more than 20 Russian athletes who competed at the 2014 Sochi Games were banned for life from the Olympics for having allegedly violated anti-doping rules.
Russia’s athletics federation, Paralympic Committee and anti-doping agency RUSADA remain suspended over doping scandals.


MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian lawmakers should not attend the 2018 Pyeongchang Olympics to support athletes unless they are competing under the Russian flag, the Interfax news agency quoted Russian parliament speaker Vyacheslav Volodin as saying on Friday.
“If we cannot ensure the possibility of our athletes competing under our flag, in the name of our country, we have nothing to do there,” Interfax quoted Volodin as telling lawmakers in parliament.
The International Olympic Committee (IOC) banned Russia on Tuesday from next year’s Winter Games after evidence emerged of an “unprecedented systematic manipulation” of the anti-doping system.
The door was left open, however, for Russians to compete as neutrals as long as they satisfy conditions that show they have a doping-free background.


NAGOYA, Japan (Reuters) - Nathan Chen of the United States overcame an error-filled program including a fall to win the men’s Grand Prix Final on Friday, beating hometown favorite Shoma Uno by half a point.
He took 183.19 in the free skate for a total of 286.51 to Uno’s 286.05.
“I‘m extremely honored to be Grand Prix champion,” Chen said after an ambitious routine to “Mao’s Last Dancer” that included attempts to make at least five quadruple jumps.
Uno, who won the free skate with 184.50, fell on his first quad loop and pulled a face at the end of his routine. Russian Mikhail Kolyada finished third.
Earlier, Canada’s Kaetlyn Osmond took a surprise lead in the short program in the women’s final but was less that half a point ahead of Russian teenager Alina Zagitova.
Osmond hit a seasonal best with 77.04 after her sultry, sassy routine to “Sous le Ciel de Paris” that had the audience at the packed arena in the central Japanese city of Nagoya clapping along.
“Overall, I‘m really happy,” the 22-year-old Osmond told a news conference.
“I’ve been working really hard on my free program, especially in the last few weeks,” she added.
Zagitova, making her Grand Prix Final debut at the age of 15, skated a routine at turns lyrical and powerful to “Black Swan” but a mistake on a jump kept her score at 76.27.
“I was nervous first of all, but happy that I could win out over my nervousness,” she said.
Japan’s Satoko Miyahara was third on her comeback after an 11-month absence due to a hip injury.


(Reuters) - Peru’s hopes at next year’s World Cup finals were dealt a huge blow when captain and all-time record goalscorer Paolo Guerrero was banned for one year on Friday after failing an anti-doping test for cocaine.
The 33-year-old striker, who plays for Flamengo in Brazil, had been provisionally suspended by world governing body FIFA after the drug, classified as a stimulant, was found in his system after Peru’s 0-0 draw away to Argentina in a World Cup qualifier in October.
“The player tested positive for cocaine metabolite benzoylecgonine, a substance included in WADA’s 2017 Prohibited List under the class ‘S6. Stimulants’, following a doping control test conducted after the match,” FIFA said in a statement.
“By testing positive for a prohibited substance, the player has violated article 6 of the FIFA Anti-Doping Regulations and, as such, contravened article 63 of the FIFA Disciplinary Code.”
Peru qualified for the World Cup finals for the first time since 1982 by beating New Zealand in a two-legged playoff. Guerrero missed both those matches.
His ban will be back-dated to Nov. 3 and will apply to international, domestic and official friendly fixtures.
Guerrero, who used to play for German club Bayern Munich, made his international debut in 2004 and has 83 caps, scoring 32 goals.
He helped Peru finish third in the 2011 and 2015 Copa Americas and was leading scorer in both tournaments.
He also helped Brazilian club Corinthians win FIFA’s World Club Cup in 2012, scoring the winning goal in the final against Premier League side Chelsea.
He joined Flamengo in 2015 and has been prolific in front of goal, scoring 42 goals for the Rio de Janeiro club.


LONDON (Reuters) - Spaniards Rafael Nadal and Garbine Muguruza were named as the International Tennis Federation (ITF) world champions on Friday - the first time in 19 years the awards have gone to players from the same country.
Nadal, who claimed the honor for the third time, made a sensational comeback from an injury-plagued 2016, winning a 10th French Open title and the U.S. Open to take his grand slam haul to 16, three behind Roger Federer who also won two of the year’s majors after returning from injury.
The 31-year-old Mallorcan ended the year as world number one, although he pulled out of the season-ending ATP Finals in London due to a knee injury.
Muguruza won the ITF award for the first time after capturing the Wimbledon title and ascending to the world number one ranking for the first time.
She ended the year ranked number two behind Romania’s Simona Halep who is still chasing a first grand slam title.
The last time two players from the same country scooped the awards was in 1998 when Americans Pete Sampras and Lindsay Davenport took the honors.
Lukasz Kubot of Poland and Marcelo Melo of Brazil won the men’s doubles award while Chan Yun-Jan of Chinese Taipei and the recently-retired Martina Hingis of Switzerland took the women’s prize.


(Reuters) - Canadian Georges St-Pierre has vacated the UFC middleweight title he won on his recent return to the octagon as the recent upheaval in the sport continued.
Australian Robert Whittaker was installed as the new champion after the latest of a number of title vacations and the awarding of interim belts.
Ireland’s two-division champion Conor McGregor was stripped of the UFC featherweight strap last year and Tony Ferguson won the interim title in the lightweight division where McGregor still holds the belt.
“Out of respect to the athletes and the sport, I don’t want to hold up the division,” St-Pierre said in a statement, citing a health issue.
The UFC, widely recognized as the premier MMA organization, announced that the 26-year-old Whittaker, Australia’s first UFC champion, will make his first defense of the title against American Luke Rockhold in Perth next year.


TOKYO (Reuters) - Born and raised in Japan, three North Korean soccer players are expecting to face boos from the home crowd in a match that comes less than two weeks after the latest North Korean test missile splashed into the Sea of Japan.
An Byong Jun, Kim Song Gi and Lee Yong Jick, who play their club soccer for J League division 2 sides, will represent North Korea when they take on Japan in Tokyo on Saturday in the final round of the East Asian Football Championship.
The sporting contest is being held with the world still on edge after the North heightened alarm in South Korea, Japan and the United States by test firing an intercontinental ballistic missile on Nov. 29 that appeared to demonstrate increasing range.
North Korea has test-fired missiles over the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido twice earlier this year and has threatened to sink Japan into the sea with a nuclear bomb.
Unsurprisingly, Kim, a 29-year-old central defender, who hails from Hyogo prefecture in western Japan and plays his club soccer for Machida Zelvia in Tokyo, expects a hostile reception from Japanese supporters.
“Bring on the booing,” said Kim. “Being booed actually gets me fired up. I was brought up that way and it doesn’t really bother me.”
He is eager to avenge a one-nil loss when he first played against Japan for North Korea six years ago.
Kim, An and Lee all took up soccer when they were children attending Pyongyang-affiliated schools in Japan and saw playing as a North Korean international as the path to the highest level.
“Soccer was all I thought about when I was a kid and it was my dream to play for North Korea,” Kim said. “My biggest goal now is to go to the World Cup.”
Japanese nationality is inherited through parents, not place of birth, meaning the three players of North Korean descent are considered foreigners and ineligible to play for Japan’s national team.
‘COMPLICATED’
The players’ status as permanent residents in Japan is a throwback to the complex and conflicted relationship between the countries.
Many Koreans were forced to move to Japan during its occupation of the Korean peninsula before and during World War Two, and suffered discrimination.
They and their descendants are now eligible to become naturalized Japanese citizens, but many are loath to do so because that would involve giving up their Korean nationality and suffering a perceived loss of cultural identity.
There were about 339,000 people with special permanent resident status - mostly those with Korean or Taiwanese ancestry - living in Japan last year, government data shows.
“I’ve never thought of taking Japanese citizenship,” said Kim. “My soul is 100 percent North Korean.”
Lee, a 26-year-old Osaka native playing his first match against Japan, said he wasn’t sure how the fans would react, noting that the team had expected boos when they played in South Korea but received applause instead.
“It’s complicated,” said the Kamatamare Sanuki defender, who switches to midfield for North Korea.
“I hope we’re treated the same as other teams that play against Japan. To be honest I hope we don’t get booed.”
Regarding political tensions, he said that things might seem bad looking only at the news in Japan but that he and his teammates had also seen a good side to North Korea on their trips to Pyongyang, on school trips and for training camp.
An, who will also be playing his first match against Japan, said he was looking forward to playing in his hometown Tokyo and expected a good turnout from ethnic Korean fans.
He said he had a lot of J League friends on the Japanese squad with whom he exchanges text messages and he was looking forward to a good match regardless of international tensions.
“Soccer’s great because teams can play fair and square and those kind of politics don’t matter,” said the 27-year-old Roasso Kumamoto forward.
“All I want to do is go out and represent my country as a soccer player.”
Japan and North Korea last met in 2015, at the East Asia Football Championship in China, where North Korea prevailed 2-1.
This year’s men’s tournament, which also features China and South Korea, runs Dec. 9-16. The women’s tournament, comprising the same countries, is being held Dec. 8-15.

Sharks 5, Hurricanes 4 (OT)
Brent Burns scored his second goal of the season 22 seconds into overtime as San Jose beat Carolina.

(The Sports Xchange) - Highlights of Thursday’s National Basketball Association games:
Nets 100, Thunder 95
Caris LeVert recorded his first career double-double with 21 points and 10 assists as the Brooklyn Nets rallied from a 16-point deficit and beat the Oklahoma City Thunder 100-95 on Thursday at Ciudad de Mexico Arena.
On the first anniversary of his NBA debut, LeVert saw extensive time at point guard because of Spencer Dinwiddie’s foul trouble. In 30 minutes, Levert shot 6-of-10 and also played effective defense on Russell Westbrook down the stretch.
Westbrook finished with 31 points but shot 10-of-27 from the field. He scored only five points in the fourth quarter and was also forced into a turnover by LeVert with 2:11 remaining.
Oklahoma City missed three consecutive shots in a span of seven seconds, and LeVert iced Brooklyn’s fourth win in six games by hitting four foul shots in the final 18 seconds.
Lakers 107, 76ers 104
Brandon Ingram hit a three-pointer with eight-tenths of a second left to lift Los Angeles over Philadelphia.
Ingram led the Lakers with 21 points. Julius Randle and Jordan Clarkson added 16 apiece off the bench for Los Angeles, which snapped a five-game losing streak.
Joel Embiid had 33 points to lead the 76ers, who dropped their second straight and their third in four games.
Wizards 109, Suns 99
Bradley Beal continued his offensive surge with 34 points, and Washington won back-to-back games for the first time in almost a month with a victory over Phoenix.
Beal, who had a career-high 51 points in a win at Portland on Tuesday and 40 against the Suns earlier this year, is carrying the offensive load with John Wall (knee) out for a seventh straight game.
Forward Markieff Morris added 21 points and the Wizards won back-to-back games for the first time since winning four straight from Nov. 9-15. The Suns got 23 points from TJ Warren in their first game without leading scorer Devin Booker (adductor strain).
Rockets 112, Jazz 101
James Harden scored 29 points and Ryan Anderson added 23 to lead Houston past Utah.
Chris Paul added 18 points, 13 assists and nine rebounds for the Rockets. Houston earned its eighth straight victory and won for the 14th time in 15 games.
The Rockets made 18 three-pointers, giving them a total of 41 in two games against the Jazz this season.


(The Sports Xchange) - Atlanta linebacker Deion Jones intercepted a Drew Brees pass in the end zone with less than two minutes remaining to preserve the NFC South champion Falcons’ 20-17 victory over the New Orleans Saints on Thursday.
Matt Bryant provided the winning margin on a 52-yard field goal with just under four minutes on the clock as the Falcons (8-5) stayed in with a chance of defending their divisional crown by moving within a game of the Saints (9-4).
After Jones’ interception, the Falcons were able to run out the clock with the help of an unsportsmanlike-conduct penalty on Saints coach Sean Payton.
The Falcons won despite three interceptions by Matt Ryan, who finished 15-of-27 for 221 yards and a touchdown. Brees completed 26-of-35 passes for 271 yards and two touchdowns but threw the costly interception.
Brees had to carry more of the load for the Saints after versatile rookie running back Alvin Kamara sustained a concussion on the game’s first series.
The Falcons forced a tie with just under 10 minutes left on an eight-yard pass from Ryan to Mohamed Sanu. The play capped an 11-play, 69-yard drive that took more than seven minutes.
Ryan, who was picked off by Marshon Lattimore at the end of the first half had his first pass in the second intercepted by Chris Banjo. The Saints cashed the turnover in on a one-yard scoring pass from Brees to Michael Thomas for a 17-10 lead.
Then Ryan was picked off for the third time in four throws when Marcus Williams grabbed a pass that should not have been thrown in the end zone with Julio Jones well covered.
The first half ended in a 10-10 tie when a 47-yard field goal by Wil Lutz was nullified by an illegal formation and the Saints did not get another play with time expired.
Earlier in the second quarter, the Falcons consumed more than eight minutes in going 90 yards in 15 plays, with Devonta Freeman scoring from the one-yard line, to go ahead.
The Saints answered quickly, though, as Brees connected with Tommylee Lewis for a 26-yard touchdown.
The Saints lost Kamara on the game’s opening drive, which ended with a 34-yard field goal by Lutz that was matched by a 28-yard field goal by Bryant.
Kamara, who came in with 1,220 yards from scrimmage and 11 touchdowns, was hurt on a helmet-to-helmet hit by linebacker De‘Vondre Campbell while being dropped for a four-yard loss on a pass from Brees.


MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko, who was banned for life from the Olympics this week, insisted on Thursday there was no state-backed doping in Russia and slammed the decision to exclude Russia from the 2018 Winter Games.
The International Olympic Committee (IOC) said on Tuesday it was acting on evidence of “unprecedented systematic manipulation” of doping procedures, but left the door open for Russians to compete as neutrals at the Pyeongchang Games in February if they can demonstrate a doping-free record.
“Russia has never encouraged doping,” said Mutko, who was sports minister when Russia hosted the last Winter Olympics.
“There could not have been a (state-run) doping program. An athlete is monitored 365 days a year. (Doping control officers) can show up any time and take a sample,” R-Sport news agency quoted Mutko as saying.
Mutko said earlier on Thursday that he was ready to resign over the Olympic ban if it was deemed necessary. Mutko said the same thing before the 2016 Rio Olympics when Russia’s participation was in limbo over allegations of state-sponsored doping, and did not resign.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Wednesday declined to say whether officials involved in organizing the 2014 Sochi Games, including Mutko, would be punished. He said such reprimands were not a priority.
Echoing earlier comments by President Vladimir Putin, Mutko said the Russian authorities will support athletes who wish to compete at the 2018 Pyeongchang Winter Games as neutrals. But he called the IOC ban “discriminatory”.
Russian authorities have vehemently denied any state support for doping and pledged to cooperate with international sports authorities to counter the use of banned performance-enhancing drugs.
But a report commissioned by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) last year found that more than 1,000 Russian competitors in over 30 sports were involved in a conspiracy to conceal positive drug tests over a period of five years.
The country’s athletics federation and anti-doping agency were suspended over a separate WADA report in 2015 containing evidence of state-backed doping in track and field.
In the weeks before the IOC decision, more than 20 Russian athletes who competed at the Sochi Games were handed Olympic life bans for alleged doping offences.
The bans came as the result of an IOC investigation into allegations of state-backed doping among Russian competitors and sample tampering by laboratory and security officials at Sochi.
Russia’s athletics federation and Paralympic Committee remain suspended from international competition over doping scandals, along with its anti-doping agency, RUSADA.


(Reuters) - German teenager Max Burkhart has died of injuries sustained in a crash during a Nor Am Cup race in Lake Louise, Alpine Canada said in statement.
Burkhart crashed into safety netting on Tuesday and was airlifted off the course and taken to Foothills hospital in Calgary.
The 17-year-old skier died from his injuries on Wednesday, the International Ski Federation confirmed on its website on Thursday.
“Alpine Canada and Alberta Alpine are devastated about this tragic loss of life and sends its deepest condolences to his family and team mates. Alpine Canada and Alberta Alpine encourage the ski family around the world to support the athletes’ family and team mate through this difficult time,” said Alpine Canada in a statement.
The race was run on the same hill used for the first World Cup women’s downhills of the season on Friday and Saturday that also produced several crashes, including one by American Lindsey Vonn, who careened into three sets of safety netting before coming to stop.
The most successful women’s skier of all-time with 77 career wins, including 18 at the Canadian resort, laid motionless but eventually got up and skied to the bottom of the course uninjured.
Burkhart’s death comes soon after another tragedy.
French downhiller David Poisson was killed in a training run crash at nearby Nakiska on Nov. 13 as he prepared for the first men’s World Cup downhill of the season.


SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea’s winter Olympics organizers have worries other than a ban on Russia competing, poor ticket sales and tensions over North Korea. They fear it may be too cold.
The Pyeongchang Games in February may feel like the coldest Olympics in at least three decades because the main stadium lacks a roof, leaving an estimated 35,000 spectators, including world leaders, exposed to extreme cold for the opening ceremony.
The organizing committee’s concerns are contained in an internal document, seen by Reuters, which expects biting winds to make conditions inside the open-air stadium at the start of the Games seem like minus 14 degrees Celsius.
That “feels-like” temperature is lower than the minus 11 degrees recorded at the 1994 Lillehammer Games in Norway, whose stadium also lacked a roof and is so far the coldest Olympics for which such data is available, the internal document shows. Reuters could not find comparable data for earlier Games.
South Korea, which built Pyeongchang’s $58 million stadium without a roof to save time and money, plans a range of measures at opening and closing ceremonies to prevent people suffering hypothermia -- from distributing hot packs and blankets to speeding up security checks, the internal document shows.
Organizers also plan to use audience participation during pre-ceremony entertainment to help keep spectators warm, the document says without giving details.
Graphic: Winter Olympics temperatures - here%20WEATHER-01.jpg
After the news last month that six people had reported hypothermia during a pop concert at the stadium, organizers are also considering installing more large windshields around the stadium, a sports ministry official said.
“These are stopgap measures,” said Shim Ki-joon, a ruling-party lawmaker, who sits on a parliamentary special committee set up to support the Games.
“This is a very serious issue. This is creating a headache to not only the organizers but the presidential office, which sent officials to the venue to figure out ways to fight the cold,” he told Reuters.
A presidential spokesman declined to comment on the matter.
President Moon Jae-in has invited Chinese President Xi Jinping and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to the Games, among other VIPs. U.S. President Donald Trump has committed to sending a “high-level” delegation, the White House has said.
Some 160 VIPs will be offered thicker and bigger blankets than those given to other spectators, a committee official said.
The opening and closing ceremonies will both take place in the evening, on Feb. 9 and Feb. 25 respectively. Spectators will stay outdoors for four to five hours on each occasion.
In Lillehammer in 1994, the ceremonies were held outdoors and organizers scrapped the tradition of releasing doves, a symbol of peace, because they worried the birds might suffer. Instead, the Norwegians released white dove-shaped balloons.
The International Olympics Committee discussed Pyeongchang’s cold weather at its executive board meeting this week, Olympic Games Executive Director Christophe Dubi told a news conference.
“It is not something we have not encountered in the past,” Dubi said on Wednesday, citing Lillehammer as well as the Salt Lake City Games in 2002.
“(Organizers) have installed windscreens and (provided) blankets and there will be plenty of information. In the last K-pop concert people were not well informed of how cold it could get.”
The cold weather is at least a manageable problem for the organizers. Its other headaches are less so.
Political tensions with North Korea and China have chilled foreign interest in the Pyeongchang Games, which open just 80 km (50 miles) from the world’s most heavily fortified border.
As of Dec. 5, ticket sales totaled 578,000, or 54 percent of target, though an organizer said that was similar to sales at a similar point ahead of the Sochi Games in Russia in 2014.
The International Olympic Committee has also banned Russia, which finished top of the medals table at Sochi, from Pyeongchang, citing evidence of state-sponsored, systematic cheating of doping controls.
Pyeongchang organizers had urged South Korea to equip the stadium with a roof and heating, but this was rejected due to costs and concerns over whether the structure would support a roof. The temporary arena is to be dismantled after the Games.
The culture and finance ministries, both involved in approving construction costs, did not respond to requests for comment.
“The cold could ruin the entire opening party. The fate of the event is down to the mother nature,” said ruling party lawmaker Yeom Dong-yeol at the Pyeongchang parliamentary committee, who was born and raised in the town.


(Reuters) - U.S. Masters champion Sergio Garcia was named the European Tour’s Golfer of the Year for the first time on Thursday, capping an excellent year in which he also triumphed in the Dubai Desert Classic and the Andalucia Valderrama Masters.
The 37-year-old, who beat Englishman Justin Rose in a playoff back in April to capture his maiden major in Augusta, is the third Spaniard to win the award after Seve Ballesteros and Jose Maria Olazabal.
”This is an amazing honour,“ Garcia said in a news release. ”I think both on and off the golf course it has been a unique and unbelievable year, and one that I will definitely remember my whole life.
“I am so happy to receive this award...against the caliber of players that were in contention, (it) is incredible. Tommy (Fleetwood), Justin, Tyrrell (Hatton) and Jon (Rahm) are all amazing players, and all had unbelievable years themselves.”
Garcia, who came fourth in the Race to Dubai Rankings, won his first European Tour title in three seasons when he finished three shots clear of Henrik Stenson at the Dubai Desert Classic in February.
Two months later, he claimed the 13th European Tour title of his career in Augusta, before winning again on home soil at the Andalucia Valderrama Masters, an event hosted by his own foundation.
“Sergio Garcia had the season of his life, which is saying a lot given the glittering nature of his long career,” said Iain Carter, chairman of the Association of Golf Writers and a member of the panel that decided the winner.
“No other player in consideration matched his tally of three wins and, of course, one of those was the Masters. It was a hugely popular triumph.”


NAGOYA, Japan (Reuters) - Nathan Chen of the United States edged Japan’s Shoma Uno in the men’s short program to take the lead at the Grand Prix final on Thursday, setting up a showdown between the two jumping powerhouses two months before the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics.
On the first day of the competition, often seen as a key step on the road to the Olympics, Chen took 103.32 points for his dynamic, clean routine, while Uno, performing in his hometown of Nagoya in central Japan, had an unusual fall on a triple axel and ended up with 101.51 points.
Chen pulled off a quad lutz and triple toeloop at the start of his program to “Nemesis,” by Benjamin Clementine, then a quad flip and triple axel, after which he appeared to pump his fists briefly.
“I‘m very happy tonight,” Chen told reporters. “I made a couple of mistakes in the landing of the quads, but my triple axel was better than at Skate America so I‘m happy with that.”
Uno, skating to the “Winter” section of Antonin Vivaldi’s “Four Seasons,” executed a clean quad flip followed by a quad toeloop and triple toeloop that had the audience cheering, but fell on a late triple axel.
“I made a new type of mistake today, the triple axel is a jump I know I can land,” Uno said, but added he still felt he “did everything I could.”
“I’ll make efforts to put plenty of jumps I can do into my routine tomorrow.”
Russia’s Mikhail Kolyada was third with 99.22 points two days after the International Olympic Committee (IOC) banned his country from next year’s Games in South Korea for “unprecedented systematic manipulation” of the anti-doping system.
However, President Vladimir Putin and other Russian officials have said they won’t stand in the way of their athletes taking part in Pyeongchang as neutrals.
The IOC said Russians could compete at the Feb. 9-25 Games as an “Olympic Athlete of Russia” if they satisfy strict conditions that show they have a doping-free background.
Asked about the situation, Kolyada said: “I have not been reading the news, I have tried to stay away from that, because it is distracting. The main thing obviously is to get to the Olympic games.”
He later told a news conference: “If you think of what Russia’s done, I think the decision is reasonable.”
In the pairs, Germany’s Aljona Savchenko and Bruno Massot, facing their first Olympics together, took a surprise lead in the short program on 79.43 points with an entertaining routine to “That Man” by Cara Emerald which got a standing ovation.
The Chinese pair of Wenjing Sui and Cong Han, strong favorites going into Pyeongchang, were third after Han fell on their first jump and are nearly four points off the lead.
French ice dancers Gabriella Papadakis and Guillaume Cizeron (82.07) took a slender lead in the short dance over Tessa Virtue and Scott Moir of Canada (81.53). Maia and Alex Shibutani of the United States were third with 78.09.


LONDON (Reuters) - Formula One team bosses have voted Lewis Hamilton as the sport’s top driver for the fourth year in a row but Mercedes team mate Valtteri Bottas slipped to 10th place in the rankings.
The poll, published by motorsport.com on Thursday, put four times world champion Hamilton far ahead of closest rival Max Verstappen.
Bottas, winner of three races this year after joining as now-retired 2016 world champion Nico Rosberg’s replacement, was listed in 10th place after bosses awarded points according to the regular F1 scoring system.
That represented a drop of one place on where Bottas had been with Williams in 2016.
Hamilton scored 233 out of a maximum 250, with Red Bull’s Verstappen on 143. Ferrari’s 2017 championship runner-up Sebastian Vettel, also a four times champion, was third and Red Bull’s Daniel Ricciardo fourth.
Force India’s Mexican Sergio Perez dropped out of the top 10 entirely but his French team mate Esteban Ocon made his entry in fifth place, one ahead of McLaren’s double world champion Fernando Alonso.
Ferrari’s Kimi Raikkonen and Renault’s Carlos Sainz tied in seventh place with Renault’s Nico Hulkenberg a new entry at ninth.

(Reuters) - British world number nine Johanna Konta has named American Michael Joyce as her new coach for the 2018 season following her split from Belgian Wim Fisette in October.
The 26-year-old enjoyed a solid start to 2017, winning the Sydney International and Miami Open titles, and hit a career-high number four world ranking before injury and poor form saw her miss out on a WTA Finals berth.
The 44-year-old Joyce has previously worked with former number ones Maria Sharapova, whom he guided to two grand slam titles, and Victoria Azarenka, whose team he joined in early 2017 before leaving the Belarusian’s coaching squad last week.
“I‘m delighted to confirm that Michael Joyce will be joining my team for 2018,” Konta said in a statement.
“Michael is a fantastic coach with a great pedigree and I‘m really excited to work with him. 2017 has been amazing but I feel like there is so much more to come.”
Konta will begin her 2018 season at the Brisbane International, which is scheduled to start on Dec. 31.
Elsewhere, Czech Barbora Strycova, who won the Linz Open in October, has named compatriot David Kotyza as her new coach after splitting with Tomas Krupa earlier this year.
Strycova, 31, will play her first competition under Kotyza at the season-opening ASB Classic in Auckland.


(The Sports Xchange) - Roger Goodell signed a five-year contract extension to remain the commissioner of the NFL, according to a memo sent to league owners from the compensation committee on Wednesday.
ESPN’s Adam Schefter reported, citing a source, that Goodell’s contract is expected to pay him about $40 million per year and includes incentives. Darren Rovell, also of ESPN, reported the five-year deal could be worth twice as much annually as the first 10 years that Goodell was commissioner, during which he made $212.5 million.
Goodell, 58, was elected NFL commissioner in 2006, succeeding Paul Tagliabue. Goodell first joined the league as an intern back in 1982.
Steelers linebacker Ryan Shazier has been transferred from University of Cincinnati Medical Center to a Pittsburgh hospital for treatment and additional testing on his spinal injury.
Shazier was injured during Monday’s 23-20 win versus Cincinnati while making a tackle on Bengals wide receiver Josh Malone with 11:14 remaining in the first quarter. The 25-year-old Shazier hit Malone low with his shoulder pads, then immediately reached for his back while his legs remained motionless.
The Steelers had hoped Shazier would be able to return to Pittsburgh on Tuesday. His transfer to the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center was pushed back as he remained at University of Cincinnati Medical Center under the care of neurosurgeons David Okonwko and Joseph Cheng.
Eli Manning is officially back as the New York Giants’ starting quarterback for Sunday’s home game against the Dallas Cowboys.
Interim head coach Steve Spagnuolo announced the decision after the Giants practiced for the first time since the housecleaning firings of head coach Ben McAdoo and general manager Jerry Reese.
The firings on Monday by owner John Mara -- less than a week after the benching of Manning for Geno Smith created a backlash from fans -- ended a tumultuous week for the 2-10 Giants, who are going through one of the worst seasons in franchise history.
Kansas City Chiefs cornerback Marcus Peters received a one-game suspension from head coach Andy Reid following his actions against the New York Jets on Sunday, the latest in a series of incidents involving the volatile and competitive Peters in his young career.
Peters received an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty following a defensive holding call against teammate Steven Nelson during an unsuccessful two-point conversion try by the Jets. Peters picked up the official’s flag and threw it into the stands, then walked off the field to the locker room.
Cincinnati Bengals safety George Iloka’s one-game suspension has been overturned following appeal, and he will play in Sunday’s game against the Chicago Bears.
Iloka initially was suspended for one game for making helmet-to-helmet contact while hitting Pittsburgh Steelers receiver Antonio Brown after his game-tying touchdown catch with 3:51 left in the Bengals’ 23-20 loss on Monday night.
Seattle Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson was named NFC Offensive Player of the Week for his three-touchdown performance in Sunday night’s victory over the Philadelphia Eagles.
The NFL also announced that New York Jets quarterback Josh McCown earned the AFC offensive honor Week 13. He scored on a 1-yard quarterback sneak with 2:15 left to lead the Jets over the Kansas City Chiefs 38-31. McCown finished with 331 yards passing and a touchdown, and ran for two scores.


LAUSANNE, Switzerland, (Reuters) - The International Olympic Committee (IOC) on Wednesday said it would not make any payments to the international boxing federation AIBA until problems over governance and finances are sorted out.
AIBA has been riven with in-fighting for months, with former president CK Wu first provisionally suspended and then stepping down in November after a bitter dispute with his executive committee.
Wu, an IOC member, was replaced by interim chief Franco Falcinelli and the federation will convene an extraordinary congress with its national member federations on Jan. 27 in Dubai to consider proposed changes to its governance.
“The IOC executive board has major concerns with regard to the situation within AIBA in different aspects,” IOC President Thomas Bach told reporters.
“There is the governance issues, there is the fact that financial statements have not been made fully transparent, there are still questions open with regard to judging, refereeing and anti-doping and therefore we have asked AIBA for a full report by the end of January.”
Bach said he wanted to see what measures AIBA would take to tackle the problems that have tarnished the federation. Wu remains an IOC member as his membership to the Olympic body does not depend on the AIBA presidency.
“We want to see the measures AIBA is taking to address these issues. Until things will change the IOC will not make any financial contributions to AIBA,” Bach said.
He said the next payment to AIBA would be in a few months for referees for next year’s Youth Olympic Games in Buenos Aires.
This is not the first time AIBA has IOC funds blocked.
The Olympic ruling body withheld payment of more than $1 million of television rights from the Athens 2004 Olympics after a refereeing scandal at those Games.


LAUSANNE, Switzerland (Reuters) - Russia has been banned from the 2018 Pyeongchang Winter Olympics after the IOC found evidence of an “unprecedented systematic manipulation” of the anti-doping system that has led to a series of suspensions for the country’s athletes in recent months.
The International Olympic Committee (IOC) did not impose a blanket ban on Russia ahead of the Rio 2016 Summer Games but said on Tuesday that the evidence unearthed by the Schmid Commission made the doping situation impossible to dispute.
It therefore suspended Russia, which finished top of the medals table at its own 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, from next year’s Games in South Korea that run from Feb. 9-25
However, in a bid to protect “innocent athletes” the door has been left open for Russians to compete as an “Olympic Athlete of Russia”, as long as they satisfy strict conditions that show they have a doping-free background.
The IOC also decided to suspend Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) president Alexander Zhukov as an IOC member, while   Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko, sports minister at the time of the Sochi Games, was also banned from any future participation at the Olympics.
Former Switzerland President Samuel Schmid told a news conference his report focusing on allegations of government involvement in Russian doping at the Sochi Games confirmed “the systematic manipulation of the anti-doping rules and system”.
The results were not based only on testimony by Russia’s former anti-doping chief-turned-whistleblower Grigory Rodchenkov. There was also scientific evidence, witness statements documents and correspondence, he said.
“The facts are that in Russia there was systemic manipulation of doping and the anti-doping system... that also took place at Sochi 2014,” added Schmid.
IOC President Thomas Bach said: ”Today we gave the Russian delegation the opportunity to express themselves. In this meeting this afternoon the president of ROC (Russian Olympic Committee) has apologized.
“As a former athlete I am feeling very sorry for all the clean athletes who are suffering from this manipulation... but because we are allowing clean athletes to participate they can set about building a bridge for the future (rather) than erecting a new wall between Russia and the Olympic movement.”
Zhukov described the IOC decision as contradictory. “There are positive and negative sides,” he said. “The IOC has allowed all clean athletes in all sports.”
Other Russians were more forthright, with Alexei Kravtsov, president of the Russian Skating Union, saying: ”The decision is offensive, insulting and completely unjustified.
“I consider that this decision will deal a great blow to the whole Olympic movement.”
Alexei Kurashov, president of the Russian freestyle federation, added: ”The Olympic movement has discredited itself and there will be fundamental consequences to this.
“These are not the principles of Olympism. I can’t say that the activities of the IOC are honest.”
“WELCOME STEP”
U.S. Senator John McCain, a frequent critic of the Kremlin, praised the IOC announcement.
“The International Olympic decision to ban Russia from the 2018 Winter Olympics is a welcome step in serving justice to Vladimir Putin’s government for its elaborate doping scheme in 2014,” he said in a statement.
“Today’s announcement sends an important message to Putin’s Russia that being a member of the international community means abiding by rules, norms, and standards - and that anything less will not be tolerated.”
The IOC’s decision comes 18 months after it decided not to impose an outright ban on Russian athletes ahead of Rio and told international sports federations to decide individually on the participation of Russians at the Olympics in Brazil.
While all of Russia’s track and field athletes bar one and the weightlifting team were banned from Rio, about 70 percent of Russia’s original 387-strong squad took part at those Games.
Bach said on Tuesday, however, that the situation was different now.
“(Ahead of Rio) there was no opportunity to hear the Russian side and at the time of Rio it was mainly about the failure in the Moscow lab. Now it’s about the manipulation of an Olympic lab. The conditions then and now are totally different.”
The Schmid report said the IOC had “not found any documented, independent and impartial evidence confirming the support or the knowledge of this (anti-doping manipulation) system by the highest State authority” after Richard McLaren’s independent report for the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) had said the Russian government and secret service were involved.
McLaren’s report in 2016 found more than 1,000 Russian competitors in over 30 sports had been involved in a conspiracy to conceal positive drug tests over a five-year period.
In the last month, the IOC’s own commission has banned more than 20 Russian athletes from the Olympics for life over doping violations at the Sochi Games, while the country’s athletics federation remains banned from that sport.
McLaren welcomed Tuesday’s decision, saying: ”By holding Russia accountable for its actions, which date back at least to the (2012) London Games and continued through the Sochi Games, the sports community is demonstrating its commitment to ensuring athletes benefit from an even playing field and drug-free competition.
“This decision further confirms the conclusions of my investigation, and I wish to thank all those who helped me with my work -- some of whom did so at great personal risk.”
World Anti-Doping Agency president Craig Reedie said the IOC had taken an informed decision to sanction Russia for its involvement “in institutionalized manipulation of the doping control process before, during and after the 2014 Sochi Olympic Games”.
Travis Tygart CEO of the United States Anti-Doping Agency said: “Over the past three years, a high stakes game of chicken has been played between those willing to sacrifice the Olympic ideals by employing a state-directed doping program to cheat to win and, on the other side, athletes unwilling to stand silent while their hopes and dreams were stolen and the Olympic Games hijacked. Today the IOC listened to those who matter most – and clean athletes won a significant victory.”
The decision comes seven months before Russia hosts the soccer World Cup, though Bach declined to comment on what, if any, impact Tuesday’s decision might have on that tournament.


MOSCOW (Reuters) - President Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday a decision by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) this week to ban the Russian team from competing at next year’s Winter Olympics looked politically-motivated, the Interfax news agency reported.
“It all looks like an absolutely orchestrated and politically-motivated decision,” Interfax cited Putin as saying. “We see this. For me, there are no doubts about this.”
Putin said earlier on Wednesday there were many questions about the IOC’s decision, but that it would be up to every Russian sportsperson to decide if they participate as neutral competitors.


MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday questioned why the country’s competitors at the Winter Olympics next year will not be able to compete under the Russian flag, Russian news agencies reported.


MOSCOW (Reuters) - A decision by the International Olympic Committee to bar Russia’s team from next year’s Winter Olympics is part of a larger international campaign to pressure Russia, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said on Wednesday.
She told a news conference that because attempts to isolate Russia economically and politically had failed, the focus of Russia’s adversaries had switched to sport instead.


MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday he had never instructed his officials to deliver victory for Russia at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russian news agencies reported.
Evidence of doping by Russian competitors at the Sochi games led the International Olympic Committee (IOC) this week to ban the Russian team from competing at next year’s Winter Olympics in South Korea.
Putin said on Wednesday there were many questions about the IOC’s decision, but that it would be up to every Russian sportsperson to decide if they participate as neutral competitors.


LAUSANNE, Switzerland (Reuters) - Pyeongchang 2018 daily ticket sales have tripled since the start of the Olympic torch relay in South Korea last month with the International Olympic Committee (IOC) hopeful of 90 percent of them being sold by the start of the Winter Games on Feb. 9.
Organizers have so far sold about half of the expected 1.1 million ticket target after months of lagging sales.
But IOC Olympic Games Executive Director Christophe Dubi said on Wednesday the numbers had picked up in the first Asian country outside Japan to host the Winter Games since the flame arrived in South Korea from ancient Olympia on Nov. 1.
“We discussed about the ticketing situation, which is improving,” Dubi said after a progress report on the Pyeongchang Games to the IOC Executive Board.
“It is true we can see a big difference in tickets sales on a daily basis. Sales have tripled from prior to the torch relay,” he said.
Low numbers in the previous months triggered alarm bells among organizers who decided to enforce a back-up plan of mobilizing 17 local governments and schools to boost sales.
“We are now at 55 percent. We average 1,200 a day without counting school sales,” Dubi said.
“We have to trust the Koreans. They said there would be a last minute surge of sales. The intention is to get to 90 percent at the start of the Games which would be a fabulous result.”
The run-up to the Games has been overshadowed by the ongoing crisis on the Korean peninsula and the IOC decision on Tuesday to ban Russia from the Games over “unprecedented systematic manipulation” of the anti-doping system.
Political tension has risen in recent months with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald Trump exchanging threats and insults over the North’s nuclear missile development program.


JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Local favorite Louis Oosthuizen has pulled out of the Johannesburg Open starting on Thursday after a freak accident that will go down as one of sport’s more unusual injuries.
The 2010 British Open champion hurt his fingers when they were caught between two airport trollies as he returned to South Africa from competing at the Mauritius Open this past weekend.
Oosthuizen, who is in severe pain and unable to grip his clubs, said he did not want to risk starting a tournament he could not finish and deny another player the chance to compete.
“This morning is even worse than it was yesterday, so I tried to grip a golf club but there’s no way I can go to my grip position,” he said in a news conference on Wednesday.
“It’s a bit of an unfortunate one, but I don’t want to tee off Thursday and play one hole or a few shots and then withdraw after taking someone’s spot. You know, I just can’t do that. So, I’m going to have to withdraw from this one.”
Cody Martin of the United States has been drafted into Oosthuizen’s three-ball that also includes last week’s winner in Mauritius, Dylan Frittelli, and Jazz Janewattananond of Thailand.
The Joburg Open at the Royal Johannesburg & Kensington Golf Club is part of the European Tour’s International Schedule, co-sanctioned by the Asian Tour and South Africa’s Sunshine Tour.


ZURICH (Reuters) - Kuwait can return to international football following an absence of more than two years after FIFA lifted a ban on the country’s football association on Wednesday.
Kuwait was suspended in October 2015 over a government bill which the global soccer body said interfered in the independence of the country’s FA and fell foul of the FIFA statutes.
FIFA said in a statement that the lifting of the ban followed official confirmation “that the Kuwait Parliament has adopted a new Sports Law of Kuwait, which replaces all the previous ones and has been amended in order to be fully compliant with the FIFA Statutes and requirements.”
The lifting of the ban means Kuwait’s national teams and clubs can take part in international competition again and it again becomes eligible for FIFA grants.


ZURICH (Reuters) - Twenty-two Russian athletes banned for life by the International Olympic Committee for doping offences at the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics are appealing their ban, the Court of Arbitration for Sport said on Wednesday.
Their appeal comes a day after the IOC banned Russia from next year’s Pyeongchang Winter Olympics, allowing only invited clean athletes to participate as neutrals.
“The Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) has registered 22 appeals filed by Russian athletes against decisions taken by the Disciplinary Commission of the International Olympic Committee,” CAS said.
It said the athletes had asked CAS to rule before the start of the Feb. 9-25 Pyeongchang Olympics in South Korea.
Among those appealing are gold medalist bobsledders Aleksandr Zubkov and Dmitry Trunenkov, cross-country gold medalist Alexander Legkov and champion skeleton racer Aleksander Tretiakov.
The IOC found the athletes violated anti-doping rules as part of a wider, systematic doping effort by Russia at the Sochi Games. It barred them from the events they had competed in, confiscated all medals they had won and banned them from taking part in any future Olympic games.
Lifetime Olympic bans have been overturned at CAS in the past, with the court ruling that athletes who had been suspended for doping could not be punished again by being left out of the Olympics.
The 22 Russians are set to miss February’s Games whatever happens, because doping violations carry bans of two to four years for first-time offenders.


VIENNA (Reuters) - An independent commission will investigate former Austrian skiers’ allegations of sexual assaults by coaches, supervisors and team members from the 1970s until at least 2005, the Austrian province of Tyrol said on Tuesday.
Former Olympic skier Nicola Werdenigg said last month that she was raped when she was 16 by a male team colleague and that what happened to her was not an isolated incident.
More former Austrian ski athletes have since spoken out, though anonymously, since Werdenigg’s interview, reporting similar experiences and suggesting the abuse was systemic.
The issue in Austria has arisen as numerous allegations of sexual harassment in entertainment, business, politics and sport have been made worldwide in recent months.
Werdenigg, the 1975 Austria downhill champion, did not reveal any names in her interview with the daily Der Standard. She alleged assaults and sexual violence by coaches, supervisors, colleagues, service staff at a Tyrolean boarding school for ski racers.
“We take the allegations of physical and psychological violence and abuse in connection with youth sports, which have arisen in recent weeks, as a reason to deal transparently and openly with the subject,” Tyrolean Governor Guenther Platter said on Tuesday.
Werdenigg was questioned by Tyrolean prosecutors in the city of Innsbruck on Tuesday.
It was not known whether she named any alleged  offenders. Contacted by Reuters in the evening, she said in a text message the interview was still going on.
The chief of the Austrian Ski Federation (OSV), Peter Schroecksnadel, said in an initial reaction to Werdenigg’s accusations that he was taking the claims very seriously and that he had never heard of such allegations since he became head of the sport’s body in 1990.
Both male and female athletes were exposed to sexual assault during her time at boarding school, Werdenigg, who finished fourth in the Olympic descent in 1976 under her maiden name     Spiess, said in November.
Another former female skier, who wanted to stay anonymous backed up Werdenigg’s allegations.
A male skier told daily Kurier that sexual transgressions were still common in the 1980s and 1990s during his time at another Tyrolean boarding school for skiers.
His descriptions of admission rituals, which included the anal insertion of ski wax, was supported by another female athlete who said she went to a boarding school in the province of Styria in the late 1990s.
Several former athletes, who in recent days spoke to local media about sexual assaults they endured and witnessed during their active time, said it was hard to imagine that the ski federation knew nothing.
“Everyone knew about such procedures. It was thought that it was normal. It was barely talked about, and certainly nothing was done,” Werdenigg said in the Standard interview.
The ski federation said in a statement that it was neither  responsible for the boarding schools nor had any influence on the selection of teachers,”
“We explicitly dissociate ourselves from being named as a co-responsible institution in connection with such incidents,” the federation said.
The association has 140,000 members, including World Cup winner Marcel Hirscher and Olympic gold medalist Anna Veith.


LAUSANNE, Switzerland (Reuters) - Following are the key findings of a report by the IOC disciplinary commission, headed by former Switzerland President and Federal Council member Samuel Schmid, that led to Russia being banned from the Pyeongchang Games on Tuesday.
The commission based its findings on an independent report by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren that was commissioned by the World Anti-Doping Agency and published last year.
Russia has denied that the state was involved in doping cover-ups.
* The commission confirmed that the Russian authorities developed a system that allowed a Moscow laboratory to routinely change positive test results to negative, as well as to tamper with samples during the Sochi Games in 2014.
It said this confirmed the “unprecedented nature of the cheating scheme and, as a consequence, the exceptional damage to the integrity of the IOC, the Olympic Games and the entire Olympic Movement.”
However, the commission said it had not found “any documented, independent and impartial evidence confirming the support or the knowledge of this system by the highest State authority.”
* Thirty-four Russian athletes tested positive in re-analysis of samples from the 2008 and 2012 Olympics, the commission said. This confirmed “a widespread culture of doping in Russia, affecting numerous sports for a long period of time.”
* The commission said it found “some similarities” with the doping situation in the former East Germany but “considers that the system in the former GDR was different from the one described.”
* The commission said it was able to confirm allegations that some individuals received payments to conceal positive doping tests, having previously encouraged athletes to purchase doping substances.
* Before around 2011-12, athletes were obliged to purchase doping products, pay to cover up their individual test results or both, the commission said. Afterwards, the program covered the costs of the manipulation of the doping tests.
* The commission said that the system progressed along with anti-doping technologies. It began with deceit on the reporting system, escalated with the creation of false biological profiles and ended with the tampering of samples.
* The commission said that evidence in the McLaren report showed “failure to respect the WADA Code within the various entities under the responsibility of the Russian Ministry of Sport.”
It said that ”the then Russian Minister had the ultimate administrative responsibility for the acts perpetrated at the time within the Russian Ministry or the entities under its responsibility.
* The commission noted that the McLaren Report did not mention that the Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) participated in the system. However, it said that “the ROC must be held legally responsible for the breach of its legal and contractual obligations.”


TORONTO (Reuters) - The Seattle Sounders hope to silence critics in Saturday’s MLS Cup rematch with Toronto FC following last year’s triumph on penalty kicks after they failed to put a single shot on goal during regulation.
During last year’s final, an energetic Toronto side pushed forward for set pieces while Seattle seemed more content to pick their spots on the counter but ultimately set an MLS Cup record with no shots on target.
“Certainly for the soccer pundits, for the sportscasters, for some of the people that classified our win last year as ‘no shots on goal,’ sure I’d like to silence some of those critics,” Seattle coach Brian Schmetzer told a conference call on Tuesday.
“But we never do not try and go out and score. We don’t bunker in for 90 minutes because we understand that that’s the way you don’t win soccer games.”
Toronto will again host Seattle in the MLS Cup and both teams are expecting a more open contest than last year but the Sounders are mindful of letting the game get away from them.
Seattle goalkeeper Stefan Frei said his team are at their best when they are defensively sound and so will do their best to avoid getting into a back-and-forth match with Toronto and risk opening up space for Jozy Altidore and Sebastian Giovinco.
“We’re going to want to stay compact and organized and make it difficult for them but also take care of our chances when we get them,” said Swiss Frei, who was named the MLS Cup Most Valuable Player last year.
“Does that mean we are going to try and go for 0-0? No, not at all. We are going to try to be organized but definitely carve out some chances, hopefully more than last year.”
Italian Giovinco and American Altidore combined for 42 percent of their team’s goals during the regular season, but the dynamic duo will have their hands full against the Sounders.
Seattle have not conceded in a playoff record 647 minutes dating back to the first leg of the 2016 Western Conference Championship — a streak of nearly seven matches — and have not allowed a goal in their last 542 minutes dating back to their match with the Philadelphia Union on Oct. 1.
But Altidore, who shrugged off an ankle injury to score the goal that put Toronto into a second consecutive MLS Cup final, said he is not concerning himself with Seattle’s string of shutouts.
“It’s a final, it’s a different game,” said Altidore.
“Everything you’ve done up until this game, I‘m not going to say it goes out the window entirely, but it’s just a different animal now than the games before.”


MOSCOW (Reuters) - The President of Russia’s Olympic Committee, Alexander Zhukov, said on Tuesday that Russian athletes will appeal the International Olympic Committee (IOC) ban from the 2018 Pyeongchang Winter Olympics at the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), R-Sport news agency reported.


MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian bobsleigh federation president Alexander Zubkov said on Tuesday he was shocked by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) decision to ban Russia from the 2018 Pyeongchang Olympics.
“I am simply shocked by what is happening and what happened and by Thomas Bach’s decision regarding our country and our athletes,” Zubkov told Reuters.
Zubkov was stripped last month of the two gold medals he won at the 2014 Sochi Games and banned from the Olympics for life over alleged doping violations.
He says he is innocent and has vowed to appeal the bans against Russian bobsledders at the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS).


MOSCOW (Reuters) - The head of Russia’s curling federation on Tuesday slammed the IOC decision to ban Russia from the 2018 Pyeongchang Winter Olympics as unprofessional.
“I consider that the IOC’s decision is unprofessional,” the federation’s president, Dmitry Svishchev, told Reuters. “I am profoundly convinced that it was made under pressure. Someone needed Russia not to participate in the Games.”


MOSCOW (Reuters) - The Russian Foreign Ministry said on Tuesday Russia would not be rattled by the International Olympic Committee’s (IOC) decision to ban it from the upcoming winter Olympics and would survive the ordeal.
It was responding after the IOC said on Tuesday that Russia had been banned from the 2018 Pyeongchang Winter Olympics after evidence emerged of an “unprecedented systematic manipulation” of the anti-doping system.
“We can never be knocked down,” Maria Zakharova, a ministry spokeswoman, wrote on social media. “Not by a world war, not by the collapse of the Soviet Union, not by sanctions. We take it and we survive.”


MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian ice hockey star Ilya Kovalchuk on Tuesday told his country’s clean athletes to make sure they took part in the 2018 Pyeongchang winter Olympics if they satisfied strict conditions that showed they had a doping-free background.
He was speaking after the International Olympic Committee (IOC) said on Tuesday it had banned Russia from the 2018 Pyeongchang Winter Olympics after evidence emerged of an “unprecedented systematic manipulation” of the anti-doping system.
“We all perfectly understand that the IOC decision is pure politics and we understand against whom it is directed,” Kovalchuk told the R-Sport news agency.
“It was clear that there would be such a decision. But if the athletes go there, it will unite the country. All clean athletes must go.”


MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian state television holding VGTRK said on Tuesday it would not broadcast the 2018 Pyeongchang Winter Olympics in the absence of Russia’s national team, Interfax news agency reported.
Russia’s Olympic Committee (ROC) has been banned from the Pyeongchang Games after a prolonged doping scandal but some athletes will be allowed to compete under the tag of “Olympic Athlete of Russia.”


(Reuters) - The New York Rangers, worth $1.5 billion, are the most valuable franchise in the National Hockey League for a third consecutive year, according to the annual list published by business magazine Forbes on Tuesday.
The Rangers are worth nearly triple the average of the NHL’s 31 teams, which Forbes said rose 15 percent to $594 million due in part to the $500 million expansion fee that was paid by the expansion Vegas Golden Knights, who were 14th on the list.
The Toronto Maple Leafs, who were rated the most valuable franchise from 2005-14, moved up a spot from last year to No 2 with a value of $1.4 billion.
The Montreal Canadiens ($1.25 billion), Chicago Blackhawks ($1 billion) and Boston Bruins ($890 million) rounded out the top five while the reigning back-to-back Stanley Cup champions Pittsburgh Penguins ($650 million) were 10th on the list.
According to Forbes, the big market NHL teams have received a boost to their values from what they called the ever-increasing premium being paid for teams in all the major sports.

ADELAIDE (Reuters) - James Anderson took five for 43 as England continued their bowling resurgence to dismiss Australia for 138 just before tea on Tuesday and set themselves an imposing victory target of 354 over the last five sessions of the second Ashes test.
Although the hosts managed to add only 85 runs to their overnight tally in bright sunshine at Adelaide Oval, that was enough to push their lead well past the record successful fourth innings run chase at the ground of 315.
Anderson picked up where he left off in Monday’s night session with a superb display of seam bowling to dismiss nightwatchman Nathan Lyon, a jittery Peter Handscomb and Mitchell Starc.
Chris Woakes (4-36) chipped in to see off Tim Paine and Shaun Marsh, ensuring the latter was unable to repeat the unbeaten 126 that underpinned Australia’s 442 for eight declared in the first innings.
Although the debate over whether Steve Smith should have enforced the follow-on after England were dismissed for 227 on Monday evening will continue to rage, Australia remain strong favourites to win the match and take a 2-0 lead in the series.
England’s best individual total over the 10-wicket defeat in Brisbane and the first innings in Adelaide was the 83 James Vince put together at the Gabba.
Australia’s pace attack will also be licking their lips at the prospect of bowling at the Englishmen under the lights in the final session of the day.
It was in that session on Monday night that England found their mojo with the ball and they continued to ride that momentum on Tuesday when Australia resumed on 53-4.
Handscomb was reprieved in the first over on referral when the TV pictures showed Anderson’s delivery had hit his shoulder rather than his bat, but he rarely looked comfortable.
Lyon was the first batsman to fall, however, when he chipped the ball to Stuart Broad at mid-off for 14 with Handscomb following soon afterwards for 12 courtesy of a fine catch from Dawid Malan in the slips.
Woakes got in on the act to remove Paine for 11 when Craig Overton also displayed fine catching skills to take a low catch at fine leg before Marsh (19) misjudged a fuller delivery and the ball made a mess of his stumps.
Anderson took a nasty tumble when he tried to catch Starc out off his own bowling but was soon back at the other end to get his man for 20 and record his first five-wicket haul in Australia.
Overton ended the innings when Josh Hazlewood spooned the ball to Malan at gully.


(The Sports Xchange) - Chris Boswell’s 38-yard field goal as time expired lifted the Pittsburgh Steelers to a 23-20 victory over the Cincinnati Bengals, capping an injury- and penalty-ridden Monday night matchup at Paul Brown Stadium.
The Steelers lost linebacker and leading tackler Ryan Shazier to a back injury in the first quarter. He was taken to a local hospital, reportedly with no feeling below his waist.
Antonio Brown had eight catches for 101 yards and a touchdown, and Ben Roethlisberger passed for 290 yards and two TDs in helping Pittsburgh (10-2) rally from a 17-0 second-quarter deficit for its seventh straight victory.
Cincinnati (5-7) had a franchise-record 173 penalty yards, including an offside penalty that gave Boswell 5 extra yards on his game-winner.
Andy Dalton passed for 234 yards and two touchdowns for the Bengals (5-7), who also sustained several key injuries.
Cincinnati lost cornerback Adam Jones to a groin injury and running back Joe Mixon to a concussion in the first half.
Late in the fourth quarter, Bengals linebacker Vontaze Burfict sustained a head injury on a block by receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster, who was flagged for unsportsmanlike conduct and taunting on the play.
The Steelers captured some momentum with a field goal just before halftime. Then on their first possession of the third quarter, Le‘Veon Bell caught a short pass and tiptoed the sideline past Bengals corner William Jackson III for a 35-yard touchdown to make the score 17-10.
Bell rushed for 76 yards on 18 carries.
Dalton had a 61-yard touchdown pass to A.J. Green negated by a holding penalty, and Martavis Bryant had a 96-yard kickoff return touchdown called back, also due to a hold.
Cincinnati led 20-13 with eight minutes left, but Roethlisberger’s 6-yard TD pass to Brown tied the score with 3:51 remaining.
The Bengals dominated the first quarter with 112 total yards on 16 plays.
Brown, who was questionable coming into Monday’s game, caught a 20-yard pass on his first target. However, Jones made a diving interception of a Roethlisberger pass three plays later, helping set up a 35-yard field goal by Randy Bullock to put Cincinnati ahead 3-0. Jones injured his groin on the play and did not return.
The Bengals then drove 85 yards on 12 plays on their next possession, and a 9-yard TD pass from Dalton to Green increased their lead to 10-0. Coty Sensabaugh, who was starting at left cornerback in place of Joe Haden, was beaten on the play.
Green again beat Sensabaugh for a 15-yard TD pass to Green with 31 seconds remaining in the first half. Cincinnati led 17-3 at the end of an injury-riddled first half.
Dalton was 16 of 23 for 173 yards and two touchdowns in the first half. Both of his scoring passes came on third down.


(Reuters) - Stephen Curry suffered a right ankle injury in the closing stages of Golden State’s win over New Orleans on Monday and left the arena on crutches, but later X-rays cleared him of any damage.    Curry hurt the ankle when he lunged for a steal and turned the ankle awkwardly with just over a minute remaining in the game.
Curry finished with 31 points and 11 assists as the Warriors (19-6) rallied to a 125-115 victory.


MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Having felt “angry” to have to compete with Russian dopers, Australia’s race walking champion Jared Tallent hopes the International Olympic Committee will heed calls from clean athletes to exclude the nation from the Winter Games.
The IOC is set to decide later on Tuesday whether to ban Russia from Pyeongchang over alleged institutional doping, a decision that will be watched closely by athletes and anti-doping authorities.
Moscow has vehemently denied state involvement and claimed the allegations are politically motivated.
Four years after coming second behind a Russian drug cheat at the London Olympics, Tallent was belatedly awarded the 50km walk gold last year after Sergey Kirdyapkin was stripped of the medal.
The 33-year-old Australian remains highly suspicious of the strength of Russia’s anti-doping program, however, and doubtful the country can move on from the scandals that have engulfed it in recent years.
”As a clean athlete, I would like to see them banned from the Winter Olympics,“ he told Reuters in a phone interview on Tuesday. ”I think the evidence has been pretty clear around what they did over the leadup to the last (Rio) Olympics.
”It would be disappointing to see them allowed at Pyeongchang.
“I don’t even like the fact they let them compete as neutral athletes. It’s still allowing Russians into competition.”
Russia’s anti-doping agency (RUSADA) has been suspended since a 2015 report by a World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) commission found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.
A further WADA report last year found more than 1,000 Russian competitors in over 30 sports had been involved in a conspiracy to conceal positive drug tests over a five-year period.
Last month, the IOC’s own commission has banned more than 20 Russian athletes from the Olympics for life over doping violations at the 2014 Winter Games that Russia hosted in Sochi.
The Kremlin has continued to deny any culpability, however, and said it would defend the “legitimate interests” of its Sochi athletes who were disqualified and had their medals stripped.
WADA has demanded Russia own up to state-sponsored doping as a condition of lifting its suspension on RUSADA, but Tallent could not imagine any admission would come.
“They’re just trying to save face to their people,” he said.
”It would be a pretty devastating to admit to their people that they’ve sponsored doping.
“But they aren’t going to move forward in sport until they admit they were involved. I don’t think they will move forward.”
The 15-member IOC Executive Board can opt to issue a blanket ban on Russian athletes, or allow them to compete in South Korea as neutrals.
They could also defer to international sports federations to decide on their participation as they did at Rio.
Although Russia was barred from athletics and weightlifting at the summer Games, it was able to send around 70 percent of its original 387-strong squad.
Tallent felt the IOC missed a chance to make a strong statement at Rio but was pleased the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) maintained a hard line.
The IAAF banned the Russian athletics federation in 2015 and confirmed last week that it would continue its suspension.
Russia’s race walking program has been notorious for producing drug cheats, and Tallent said his sport was better off without the nation competing.
“There’s certainly less suspicion around competition, I can tell you,” said the four-times Olympic medalist.
”Athletes feel like they’re competing in a cleaner field.
“Particularly in my event, there were always suspicions and it did make you quite angry when you knew you were up against athletes who were playing dirty.”


(Reuters) - Pittsburgh Steelers linebacker Ryan Shazier suffered a back injury and was carted off the field after a head-first collision with Cincinnati Bengals wide receiver Josh Malone during the first quarter on Monday.
Shazier slammed into Malone and immediately grabbed at his back while signaling for trainers to tend to him.
Steelers team mates kneeled around Shazier as he was strapped to a stretcher and taken off the field. The team announced that Shazier had been taken to the hospital for further evaluation.
Shazier, 25, was the team’s leading tackler through 11 games.


(The Sports Xchange) - Portland Timbers midfielder Diego Valeri was named Major League Soccer’s Most Valuable Player on Monday.
Valeri received the honor by vote of the league’s club managers, media members and current players. The other nominees included Atlanta United’s Miguel Almiron, Toronto FC’s Sebastian Giovinco, Chicago’s Nemanja Nikolic and NYCFC’s David Villa.
The 31-year-old Valeri recorded an MLS-record nine-game goal-scoring streak from July 29-Sept. 24 and finished with 21 on the season, trailing only Nikolic and Villa.
Valeri also had 11 assists in 32 games for Portland (15-11-8), which finished with the most points in the West before falling in the conference semifinals to the Houston Dynamo.


(Reuters) - A UCLA basketball player who was arrested for shoplifting in China and whose father later engaged in a public dispute with U.S. President Donald Trump will leave the university and prepare for the NBA draft next year, the player’s father told media on Monday.
“We learned today of LiAngelo Ball’s intention to withdraw from UCLA. We respect the decision he and his family have made, and we wish him all the best in the future,” UCLA Coach Steve Alford said in a statement released by the university.
Ball, a freshman, was arrested along with Cody Riley and Jalen Hill in November for stealing sunglasses at a Louis Vuitton store in Hangzhou, China. The UCLA team was touring China ahead of a visit by Trump, who said he intervened by personally speaking with Chinese President Xi Jingping to get the players released.
Trump on Nov. 15 asked on Twitter for the players’ gratitude, which came in a news conference later that day when they also admitted to the shoplifting and apologized.
Trump then got into a public dispute with Ball’s father, LaVar Ball, the outspoken head of a sports apparel company who has two other basketball-playing sons. LaVar Ball publicly downplayed Trump’s role in freeing his son and refused to offer the praise that the president was expecting.
The slight prompted at least seven tweets from Trump over eight days in which he called the elder Ball an “ungrateful fool” and bragged that “IT WAS ME” who got the players released, sparing them from potentially up to 10 years in a Chinese prison.
LiAngelo Ball, 19, has remained suspended and has not played for UCLA, prompting LaVar Ball to announce his son would leave the university and seek to enter the National Basketball Association draft next June.
“He’s not transferring to another school. The plan is now to get Gelo ready for the NBA draft,” LaVar Ball told ESPN.
“I‘m not going to let UCLA take the fire out of my boy by not letting him play for two months,” Ball told the Los Angeles Times.
Reuters was unable to reach Ball for comment.
The oldest Ball son, Lonzo Ball, 20, also played at UCLA and was chosen second overall by the Los Angeles Lakers in the 2017 NBA draft. The youngest brother, LaMelo Ball, 16, has verbally committed to playing for UCLA.


(Reuters) - British weightlifter Sonny Webster has been banned from competing after admitting on his Facebook page on Monday that he had tested positive for the banned substance ostarine.
Webster, 23, who finished 14th in 94kg category at the Rio Olympics, has been an outspoken advocate for clean sport and said he was devastated when notified four months ago.
“I was in complete shock when I found out and I still do not know how this substance came to be in my system,” Webster said in a statement on his Facebook page. “Weightlifting is my life and everything that I live and breathe and I would never risk losing this by knowingly taking a banned substance.”
Webster said in the months since learning of his positive test he has spent his life’s savings trying to find out how the banned substance got into his system.
”The money was spent on lawyers, analysis of samples and supplements and on the legal team who did all they could to establish the source,“ said Webster. ”Whilst this has been a strain financially, I knew that I had to do all that I could in order to attempt to prove my innocence.
“If I had known the source of the ostarine, I would never have spent so much money in trying to pinpoint where it came from. This whole experience has highlighted that my integrity is worth far more than any amount of money.”
While Webster maintains his innocence, he said he will grudgingly accept a four year ban without the financial resources to appeal the decision.
”This is the largest possible ban you can receive for a doping case,“ he said. ”Given the circumstances of the test and how hard I tried to find the source I felt this length of ban was wholly unjustified in comparison to athletes who cheat intentionally in competition.
“I had attempted to appeal this further but was ultimately stopped due to future legal cost and difficulty around using new experts to perform re-testing.”


KINGSTON (Reuters) - Multiple Olympic and world champion Usain Bolt has described the unveiling of his statue in front of Kingston’s National Stadium as one of the greatest moments of his career.
The statue, commissioned by the Jamaican government and revealed by Prime Minister Andrew Holness, stands in front of the place where 15 years ago Bolt won the junior championships to announce himself to the world.
“For me this is up there, it can’t be doubted that this is one of the greatest moments in my career,” Bolt told Reuters after the unveiling on Sunday.
“Having a statue in the National Stadium where it all began; there are no words, I am just happy and really excited about this.”
The statue was sculpted by Jamaican artist Basil Watson and features the 31-year-old in his trademark ‘lightning bolt’ pose, seen many times over the years as he set world records in the 100 and 200 meters, winning 11 world and eight Olympic golds.
“It was all worth it: the losses, the injuries, everything I’ve been through, it’s all worth it,” said Bolt, who signed off his stellar career with bronze in the 100m at the world championships in London earlier this year.
“It’s a wonderful thing to look back and see what your career has brought you. I‘m very happy and proud of myself for the work. It’s just a good time and I am in a good place.”
Holness has previously said that Bolt’s performances over the years has elevated the status of Jamaican sport.
“I have always aimed to make my country proud and to put my country in the best light possible so for the Prime Minster to say that it showed that my work paid off and it’s something that I am happy about,” Bolt added. “In any way that I can continue doing that, it would be great.”
Bolt was stripped of one of his nine Olympic gold medals when his former 4x100m relay team mate Nesta Carter retroactively tested positive for the banned stimulant methylhexanamine at the 2008 Beijing Olympics.
Carter has appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport against the decision resulting from the doping test.
Bolt, the only sprinter to win the 100m, 200m and 4x100 relay titles at three consecutive Olympics (2008, 2012, 2016) until Carter’s test result, was not losing any sleep over the medal missing from his glittering collection.
“I haven’t really been following it (the appeal). I‘m just waiting on the time for them to say what is what. I‘m just focusing on which direction I want my career to go,” he said.

ANAHEIM (Reuters) - Chile’s Arley Mendez returned from more than four years of international competitive exile to defeat Iran’s Olympic champion Kianoush Rostami in the men’s 85 kilogram class at weightlifting’s World Championships on Sunday, while Sohrab Moradi broke two world records in the 94kg class.
Mendez, who never returned home after competing for his native Cuba in the Pan American Junior Championships in Santiago in 2013, posted a total of 378kg to win gold ahead of Poland’s Krzysztof Zwarycz (359kg). Italy’s Antonino Pizzolato lifted 358 kgs to clinch third.
Mendez was only granted citizenship by Chile this year.
He could have also taken Rostami’s clean and jerk world record had he not failed with his final attempt at 221kg.
“My finger got stuck on the bar, a technical problem,” said Mendez. “Next year the records will come. I prepared well and I knew I would win here.”
Rostami, who injured his left knee last week, missed all three clean and jerk attempts and failed to register a total.
Moradi, who won gold in Rio last year, broke two world records in winning the 94 kilogram class, to take an easy win over Lithuania’s Aurimas Didzbalis by 29 kilograms.
Iran’s Seyedayoob Mousavijahari was in third place, three kilograms behind the Lithuanian.
The 29-year-old Moradi jumped from 220kg to 233kg on his fifth lift to break the clean and jerk world record of 232kg set in 2000 by Poland’s Szymon Kolecki, and better by four kilograms his own world record for the total, which he improved to 417kg.
”I wanted to surprise everybody and I did,“ said Moradi. ”I am proud to make every Iranian across the world very happy.”
In the women’s 75 kilogram class, Spain’s Lydia Valentin, a medalist at the past three Olympic Games, was the clear winner on 258kg from Ecuador’s Neisi Dajomes on 240kg with France’s Gaelle Ketchanke a further three kilograms behind.


(The Sports Xchange) - Shohei Ohtani is regarded as the “Babe Ruth of Japan” but he will not playing for the New York Yankees.
Yankees general manager Brian Cashman said Sunday night that the agents for Ohtani told him the two-way star is not signing with New York.
The Yankees were not the only team to learn they would not be in the running for Ohtani.
According to the Boston Globe, the Boston Red Sox were informed they were eliminated from the bidding. Other media reports indicated that the Toronto Blue Jays, Pittsburgh Pirates, Minnesota Twins, Milwaukee Brewers and New York Mets are out of the sweepstakes.
Media reports indicated that the Seattle Mariners and San Francisco Giants are among nine teams to be granted a meeting with Ohtani.
Cashman told reporters that Ohtani seems to prefer West Coast teams and smaller markets.
A World Series championship celebration may have come at a cost for Dallas Keuchel.
The 29-year-old Houston Astros ace has suffered a “minor (left) foot sprain” and is in a walking boot, reportedly the result of an injury he sustained during the team’s World Series title parade last month.
Keuchel told TMZ he slipped during the celebration. The Chronicle reports Keuchel is expected to be ready for spring training in the middle of February.
The San Diego Padres signed general manager A.J. Preller to a three-year contract extension through the 2022 season, the team announced Sunday.
Preller was originally named GM of the Padres on Aug. 6, 2014.


LONDON (Reuters) - Red Bull junior driver Dan Ticktum put McLaren in an awkward position on Sunday after winning a coveted award that includes a Formula One test drive and simulator role with the Woking-based team.
Macau Formula Three Grand Prix winner Ticktum, 18, beat three other young Britons to win the McLaren Autosport BRDC Award.
Previous winners include 2009 Formula One world champion Jenson Button and three times Indianapolis 500 winner Dario Franchitti.
Last year’s winner Lando Norris is now the McLaren Formula One reserve driver.
Ticktum, however, has been contracted to rivals Red Bull since the start of the year and has been in that team’s simulator already.
McLaren sources told Reuters the prize would be honored, with Ticktum probably getting to drive a 2013 Formula One car, but a meaningful factory simulator role with them was out of the question.
McLaren and Red Bull will both have the same Renault engines next year after the former ended a three-year partnership with Honda.
Ticktum was still delighted to be the 29th recipient of the award, whose first winner was now-retired Formula One racer David Coulthard back in 1989.
“I had an amazing weekend in Macau and this has exceeded that,” said the Briton, who was handed a part-suspended two year ban in 2015 for ignoring safety car conditions. “I cannot put into words how proud I am right now.”
“People know I had a tough career to start with and there have been some very important people who believed in me, particularly Red Bull, (team principal) Christian Horner, (Red Bull consultant) Dr Helmut Marko,” he added.
“They’ve given me a chance and I hope I can do them proud.”
Mercedes’s four times Formula One world champion Lewis Hamilton, who did not attend, sent a video message after being named best international racing driver and British competition driver.
There was also an award for retired Brazilian triple world champion Nelson Piquet, who struggled to contain his emotions, honoring his contribution to motorsport.
Piquet was presented with his award by former Brabham designer Gordon Murray, whose cars took him to his first two titles in 1981 and 1983. The third crown was won with Williams in 1987.
“It is much easier to race than to see your son racing,” said Piquet, whose son and namesake also competed in Formula One and was the first champion in the Formula E electric series in 2014-15.


ANAHEIM (Reuters) - A New Zealand transgender lifter will go for gold against an American Olympic medalist when the super-heavyweight classes bring the weightlifting World Championships to a close on Tuesday.
Laurel Hubbard, 39, who competed nationally as Gavin Hubbard, has a perfect record since returning to competition after changing gender four years ago.
She has won the three events in which she has taken part, all in Australia, since her debut in international weightlifting last March and is in New Zealand’s team for the Commonwealth Games on Australia’s Gold Coast next April.
Based on the world rankings, Hubbard should be a gold-medal contender in the +90 kg class at the worlds where home hopes rest with Sarah Robles, from San Diego, who was third at the Rio Olympics last year.
Many of the world’s best super-heavyweight women are not competing because nine nations are banned for multiple doping offences. The Olympic gold and silver medalists are absent.
Hubbard complies with the conditions put in place by the International Olympic Committee (IOC), whose procedures on transgender athletes are followed by the International Weightlifting Federation (IWF).
Her presence in women’s weightlifting has irked rivals. Tim Swords, Robles’s coach, said: “I do not want to say anything negative, but in my humble opinion this is not fair.”
Tracey Lambrechs, who lost her place as New Zealand’s top super-heavyweight when Hubbard started competing, shed 17 kilos to move down to the 90kg class and qualify for the Commonwealth Games with one national team place available in each category.
Lambrechs said Hubbard had an unfair advantage because of her history as a male lifter and recently told Radio NZ: “All I can hope is that they look into it and make a more educated judgment.”
Australian Weightlifting Federation chief executive, Michael Keelan, told the Australian Associated Press last week: “We’re in a power sport which is normally related to masculine tendencies. I don’t think it’s a level playing field. That’s my personal view and I think it’s shared by a lot of people in the sporting world.”
Because of the controversy Hubbard, whose father Dick is a former mayor of Auckland, has not spoken to the media since she began competing internationally, and has declined interview requests.
“She has said she does not want to take the focus away from other athletes,” said IWF director general Attila Adamfi.
Under the IOC regulations a male-to-female transgender athlete must show, from a period starting one year before her first competition and ending when she finishes her competitive career, that her total testosterone level is below 10 nanomols per liter.
The low point of the normal range of testosterone levels for males is 9.16 nanomols per liter, according to research published by the Endocrine Society this year.
The IOC might review its regulations when the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) had considered evidence from new research relating to female track and field athletes with high testosterone levels, said Adamfi.
Ursula Garza Papandrea, chair of the IWF Women’s Commission and president of USA Weightlifting, said the presence of Hubbard “certainly has the potential to draw a lot of controversy”.
But she added: “The rules are the rules and if it’s in the rules that’s what we go by. Whether those rules are fair or not fair is not for us to decide, it’s for the policy creators to decide.”
In the men’s super-heavyweights, Iranian Saeed Alihosseini returns to competition after an eight-year doping ban.
Alihosseini, 29, who still holds the junior world records he set in 2008, was originally banned for life but successfully appealed and, since 2011 when CAS reduced the suspension to eight years, has trained at his father’s gym.


TOKYO (Reuters) - Former world number two Kento Momota will be restored to the top tier of Japan’s national badminton team next season as he continues his long rehabilitation from a gambling scandal that ruled him out of the Rio Olympics, local media reported.
“He has returned to about the level he was at before this trouble occurred,” Kyodo news agency quoted Japan head coach Park Joo Bong as saying.
“Our big goal is the (2020) Tokyo Olympics.”
Momota became the first Japanese to win a men’s singles world championship medal when he claimed bronze at Jakarta in 2015 and also won the Super Series Masters Final that year.
His career stumbled, however, when he was banned from the national team in April, 2016, for visiting an illegal casino and missed last year’s Rio Games.
The 23-year-old only returned to international competition in July at the Canada Open and has been restricted to playing in lower-level tournaments.
Badminton power Japan claimed a gold and a bronze at the Rio Games to finish second on the medals table behind China.


(The Sports Xchange) - San Jose Sharks center Joe Thornton was fined $5,000 for slashing Tampa Bay Lightning forward Tyler Johnson during Saturday night’s game, the NHL’s Department of Player Safety announced Sunday.
The fine is the maximum allowable under the collective bargaining agreement. The money goes to the Players’ Emergency Assistance Fund.
The Dallas Stars placed center Martin Hanzal on injured reserve due to a hamstring injury, the team announced.
Hanzal, 30, suffered the injury on Tuesday against the Vegas Golden Knights. The move is retroactive to Nov. 28.
Hanzal has just three points (one goal, two assists) and 13 penalty minutes in 19 games this season.
The Stars also recalled forward Jason Dickinson from the Texas Stars of the American Hockey League.
The Columbus Blue Jackets assigned left winger Sonny Milano to the Cleveland Monsters of the American Hockey League.
Milano, 21, has five goals, five assists and four penalty minutes in 24 games with the Blue Jackets this season. He has an assist in one contest with the Monsters.
Milano owns 11 points (five goals, six assists) and four penalty minutes in 31 career NHL games with the Blue Jackets. He has 84 points (32 goals, 52 assists) in 128 career AHL games with the Monsters and Springfield Falcons.
The Edmonton Oilers claimed defenseman Brandon Davidson off waivers from the Montreal Canadiens.
Davidson, 26, appeared in 13 games with the Canadiens this season, posting one assist and nine penalty minutes.
The 6-foot-2, 208-pound native of Taber, Alberta, was originally selected by the Oilers in the sixth round of the 2010 NHL draft. He appeared in 91 games with the Oilers from 2014-17, recording 13 points (five goals, eight assists).
The Arizona Coyotes recalled defenseman Jakob Chychrun from the Tucson Roadrunners of the American Hockey League.
Chychrun, 19, has been out since suffering a knee injury before the start of training camp. He recorded 20 points (seven goals, 13 assists) and 47 penalty minutes in 68 games with the Coyotes last season.


(Reuters) - Tiger Woods proved he could be competitive again after playing some of the best golf of his comeback with a final-round four-under 68 to tie for ninth at the Hero World Challenge in the Bahamas on Sunday.
No one could match Rickie Fowler, though. The world number nine birdied his first seven holes and won the elite event by four strokes thanks to a course record 11-under par 61 that left him at 18-under 270.
Woods was 10 strokes back but he had plenty of smiles as he answered the question of how he would do in his first tournament in nearly 10 months following spinal fusion surgery.
Pain free, the former world number one struck for six birdies and an eagle at the Albany course before two closing bogeys. He also had a double bogey in the elite 18-man event that featured eight of the world’s top 10.
“I showed some good signs,” Woods told NBC Sports after finishing the four days at eight-under 280. “I hit some really good shots out there (and am ready for) a bright future.... and no pain.”
The latter was especially important to the 41-year-old who once dominated the sport.
“I’ve had some tough times through the years with my back and then finally to come out on the good side and (be) able to get back out there and play. It’s pretty cool,” he said.
He also spoke positively about the future.
“When I was struggling with my back, the world seemed very small. Day to day stuff was very difficult for me to do,” Woods said. “Now I am able to sit back and enjoy it a little bit more... It’s been really nice.”
He and his team will now sit down to determine how best to build his 2018 schedule for major championships.
“Play enough, but not play too much,” Woods said.
“I don’t know what golf courses I will be playing, what’s the best way to go about it. ...We’ll figure it out.”
He definitely had the Albany course figured over the first nine holes on Sunday.
The day after a bogey-filled front nine, Woods showed flashes of his old self with three birdies and an eagle to make the turn at five-under 31.
Reality returned at 10 where he had a double-bogey at the par-four hole. But the 79 times PGA Tour winner struck back with birdies at 11, 14 and 15 before bogeys at 17 and 18.
Fowler was looking at a seven-stroke deficit when he began his round but seven straight birdies and another at the ninth put him in front at the turn, which he made in eight-under 28.
He added three more birdies on the back nine for a sizzling, bogey-free round.
“I knew I needed to get off to a quick start today to at least show (overnight leader) Charley Hoffman) I was there,” Fowler said. “We took care of that and kept it rolling.”
Hoffman, who started the day with a five-stroke lead, shot  72 and faded to second at 274. England’s Tommy Fleetwood (67) and Jordan Spieth (69) tied for third at 12-under 276.


(Reuters) - Austrian Marcel Hirscher dominated the World Cup giant slalom event at Beaver Creek on Sunday, winning his 23rd career race in the discipline on a windy and warm day at the Birds of Prey course in Colorado.
Showing no lingering issues from the left ankle fracture he suffered in a training fall in August, the 28-year-old completed his two runs in two minutes 37.30 seconds, nearly a second faster than second-place finisher, Norway’s Henrik Kristoffersen (2:38.18).
Germany’s Stefan Luitz (2:38.33) finished third.
“The last two weeks have been really intense trying to find my speed and my confidence, because when you’re injured you lose a lot of confidence,” Hirscher said.
“It is really unbelievable but it’s just one step further on the way back.”
The win puts Hirscher one career World Cup win behind American Ted Ligety, his longtime rival who is still trying to find his form since coming back from back surgery in January.
Ligety (2:38.66), whose shaky second trip down the course landed him with a disappointing seventh-place finish, said his back felt fine during the race but he was undone by the course’s slow, “grippy” snow on an unusually warm day.
With two months to go before the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, Hirscher will hope his giant slalom dominance will translate into Olympic gold.
Despite being the winner of a record six straight overall World Cup season titles, Hirscher has just one Olympic medal to his name, a silver in slalom from the Sochi Games in 2014.


(Reuters) - A troublesome start dominated by bogeys proved costly for Tiger Woods as he struggled to a three-over par 75 in the third round of the Hero World Challenge in the Bahamas on Saturday.
After two strong rounds put the former world number one in contention for his first win since 2013, Woods recorded four of his five bogeys in the first seven holes to slip to 10th at four-under 212, 10 strokes behind leader Charley Hoffman.
Woods, in his first tournament in nearly 10 months following spinal fusion surgery, said he had some bad breaks on Saturday and that his game was better than his scorecard suggested.
“Anything I did right ended up in a bad spot, then everything I did wrong, it was really bad,” Woods told NBC television.
”I’ve got to keep fighting and that is one thing I have always done in my entire career. That’s keep fighting and try and post the best number I possibly could.
“I really didn’t feel I was that far off. That’s the crazy part ... I just ended up in bad spots after good shots.”
Only in the closing five holes, where Woods twice had birdies and narrowly missed a third at the last, did the 41-year-old show he could again be a factor at the elite 18-man event that features eight of the world’s top 10.
”It feels good to be out here fighting again,“ he said. ”I’ve missed the fight and getting out there and competing, fighting against the golf course and the guys.
“It’s so much fun.”
Breezy conditions made sub-par rounds difficult at the Albany course with overnight leader Hoffman one of the few to deliver, surging to a five-stroke lead after a birdie at 18 for a two-under 70 and a 202 total.
Jordan Spieth (72) and England’s Justin Rose (71) were tied for second at nine-under 207, one stroke ahead of Italy’s Francesco Molinari (71).
The troubles for Woods started early on Saturday as he took bogeys at the first and third holes before further miscues at six and seven saw him post a four-over 40 for the front nine.
That contrasted sharply with Friday when he took nine shots less to finish the front nine.
“The shot that really threw me for a loop was the shot at three,” Woods said. “I hit the most beautiful three wood that went 300 yards in the wind.”
But he wound up with a bogey.
Woods finally picked up a shot at the 14th, doffing his hat to the crowd in relief, before carding another birdie at the par-three 17th.
“It’s ridiculous,” he said. “It took me 14 holes to make a birdie. At that time I had already played four par-fives and nothing happened.”


(Reuters) - American Mikaela Shiffrin notched up her first career World Cup win in downhill at Canada’s Lake Louise on Saturday, one day after reaching her first ever podium in the discipline.
The 22-year-old skiing prodigy completed the course in one minute 27.55 seconds in just her fourth career downhill race.
Germany’s Viktoria Rebensburg, in 1:27.68, finished second and Michelle Gisin (1:27.72) of Switzerland was third.
Shiffrin now leads the women’s overall World Cup standings as well as the downhill standings with just over two months to go until the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang.
The win comes less than a week after Shiffrin won the World Cup slalom for the second year in a row at Killington in Vermont. She now has 33 career World Cup wins.
A day after suffering a nasty crash toward the end of her run, fellow American Lindsey Vonn (1:28.48) took a conservative approach to the course, where she is an 18-time champion.
The veteran Vonn, who skied with a brace on her right knee, finished tied in 12th with Italy’s Verena Stuffer and was almost a second behind Shiffrin.
While Vonn completed the course without incident, her team mate Breezy Johnson was not so lucky.
The 21-year-old American slid out after hitting a bump during a turn but skied off the course under her own power.
The start of Saturday’s race was delayed by an hour and 15 minutes due to a power outage at the resort caused by a fire at a substation.
The outage meant the skiers had to ride in snowcats or get towed to the top of the hill for the start.
Speed events continue at Lake Louise on Sunday with the first women’s super-G of the season.


(Reuters) - Aksel Svindal was the first out of the gate at the downhill race in Beaver Creek on Saturday and never relinquished the lead as he cruised to his 33rd career World Cup win.
The tall, powerful Norwegian pushed hard out of the starting gate and sped down the quick Birds of Prey course in one minute 40:46 seconds for his sixth career win at the Colorado resort.
“When you’re going first you’re not going to get a course report so you really need to be committed,” the 34-year-old veteran said. “If you can do that I think it is an advantage.”
Svindal, the 2010 Olympic super-G gold medalist and five-time world champion, appears in top form after his previous two seasons were cut short due to knee injuries.
Svindal edged Beat Feuz (1:40.61) of Switzerland, who won the season-opening men’s downhill at Lake Louise a week ago. German Thomas Dressen (1:40.95) finished third.
A memorial was set up on the course mourning the death of French skier David Poisson, who died in a training accident in Alberta on Nov. 13.
Adrien Theaux (1:41.26) was the fastest Frenchman down the course on Saturday, finishing eighth after posting the quickest time in training on Wednesday at Beaver Creek.


LONDON (Reuters) - Liverpool and Chelsea maintained their pursuit of runaway Premier League leaders Manchester City with comfortable wins on Saturday but Tottenham Hotspur dropped further off the pace with a disappointing 1-1 draw at Watford.
With City home to West Ham United on Sunday, and Arsenal and Manchester United facing each other later on Saturday, Liverpool showed their continuing menace by thumping Brighton and Hove Albion 5-1. Juergen Klopp’s side have now scored 15 goals in four away games in all competitions.
The German made even more changes than his team scored goals, leaving out six of the side who beat Stoke City 3-0 in midweek.
Liverpool were not weakened and after stand-in center half Emre Can put them ahead with a bullet header, Roberto Firmino hit a double, Philippe Coutinho scored from a free kick and Brighton’s Lewis Dunk headed into his own net. With the visitors three up, Glenn Murray’s 51st-minute penalty was not enough to spark Liverpool’s usual defensive jitters.
Earlier, Chelsea came from behind to sweep past Newcastle United 3-1 at Stamford Bridge.
After Dwight Gayle gave Newcastle the lead, Belgium’s Eden Hazard produced nine shots, six on target, and two goals in a display that, according to Newcastle manager Rafa Benitez, made the difference against a side who have now gone six games without a win.
Hazard also provided a potent reminder of what England can expect when they face Belgium in the World Cup in Russia next year.
At Vicarage Road, Spurs clung on for a 1-1 draw with their near neighbors after Davinson Sanchez was sent off for elbowing Brazilian Richarlison at the start of the second half. The goals came early with Christian Kabasele’s opener for Watford canceled out by Son Heung-min. Spurs are now four points behind Liverpool and 15 adrift of leaders City.
Elsewhere, Sam Allardyce and Alan Pardew both looked to deliver the new manager bounce in their first match in charge for their clubs but only Everton delivered three points in a routine 2-0 win over Huddersfield Town.
Gylfi Sigurdsson and Dominic Calvert-Lewin scored second-half goals to give Allardyce a winning start two days after he signed an 18-month contract at Everton. But the performance was short on quality and the 63-year-old will have work to do before next Sunday’s derby visit to free-scoring Liverpool.
Pardew’s first match in charge of West Bromwich Albion ended in a 0-0 home draw with Crystal Palace, who were replaced at the foot of the Premier League by Swansea City, 2-1 losers at Stoke.
The visitors went ahead through Wilfried Bony’s first goal for them in nearly two years before Xherdan Shaqiri and Mame Biram Diouf turned the game to increase the pressure on Swansea manager Paul Clement after his side’s 10th league defeat of the season.
Demarai Gray got on the end of Riyad Mahrez’s cross to give Leicester a 1-0 win over Burnley that continued the Foxes’ bright start under Claude Puel. Burnley’s bad day was made worse by an injury to Robbie Brady, who was stretchered off before the break.


ARESE, Italy (Reuters) - Formula Two champion Charles Leclerc will move up to Formula One with Alfa Romeo-backed Sauber next season while Marcus Ericcson stays in the lineup despite the Swede failing to score a point in 2017.
The announcement was made by Fiat Chrysler (FCA) chief executive Sergio Marchionne on Saturday at a presentation of Alfa Romeo’s new partnership with the Swiss team at the Italian marque’s museum near Milan.
That deal, marking the return of the historic Alfa Romeo name to Formula One after a more than 30-year absence, was announced earlier in the week.
Saturday’s event showed off a new red and white livery, with Alfa Romeo branding prominent on the engine cover, and a redesigned logo.
The lineup leaves Pascal Wehrlein, Ericsson’s German team mate, facing an uncertain future with former champions Williams the only remaining team with a vacancy but Poland’s Robert Kubica favorite to fill it.
Ferrari-backed Leclerc, 20 and from Monaco, had been expected to get the Sauber drive after a dominant season in the official feeder series.
Ericsson’s future had been in doubt, with Ferrari-backed Italian Antonio Giovinazzi also a candidate under the new partnership.
Giovinazzi will be the reserve driver instead, taking part in Friday practice sessions.
Marchionne, who is also chairman of Sauber’s engine suppliers Ferrari, has made the title sponsorship of Sauber part of his reshaping of the FCA-owned Alfa Romeo brand.
Fiat Chrysler have invested billions of euros since 2014 to develop new Alfa Romeo models that would stand up against German premium rivals and shed a reputation for poor quality and service that has hit sales in the past decade.
“Formula One is the natural reference point for a marque like this,” he said.
Marchionne added that the partnership would also strengthen his hand in talks with Formula One about the sport’s future and warned that the deal could end in 2021 if Ferrari decided to walk away as they have threatened.
“Now there is the additional benefit that when we sit down at the table to discuss the future of Formula One, we’re playing two marques,” he told reporters. “I think the guns are loaded in a different way.”
Formula One chairman Chase Carey and former Ferrari boss Jean Todt, president of the governing FIA, both attended the presentation.
In a speech, Marchionne also thanked Sauber Holding chairman Pascal Picci and Swedish billionaire Finn Rausing for their support in reaching a deal that should boost a team that finished last overall this year.
“It’s an amazing opportunity for me but also for the team,” said Ericsson, whose financial support has long been linked to Rausing and the Tetra Laval packaging group.
“I think obviously we’re starting from quite far behind because we had a difficult season, but I think we have the potential to take a good step forward.”
Alfa Romeo have a strong heritage in Formula One with the first two world championships in 1950 and 1951 won by Italian Giuseppe ‘Nino’ Farina and Argentine Juan Manuel Fangio in their cars.
Ferrari’s late founder Enzo also started out racing and managing a team for Alfa Romeo, before setting up on his own in the late 1930s.
Alfa Romeo supplied engines in the 1960s and 1970s and returned as a constructor in 1979 before again withdrawing at the end of 1985.


(Reuters) - South Africa’s Louis de Jager joined overnight leader Arjun Atwal of India at the top of the leaderboard after the Mauritius Open third round on Saturday and the pair will take a one-shot lead into Sunday’s final round of the European Tour event in Domaine del Bel Ombre.
The 30-year-old De Jager, seeking a first European Tour success, hit four birdies in a blemish-free 67 to join Atwal on 13 under par after 54 holes.
The Indian had carded a course-record 62 in Thursday’s first round not long after completing a 16-hour journey to Mauritius and shot 68 in the third round.
Dylan Frittelli of South Africa and Miguel Tabuena from the Philippines were a stroke back in third place.
South Africa’s former British Open champion Louis Oosthuizen was in a group of 16 players within five strokes of the leaders.


HONG KONG (Reuters) - Sam Bird won Formula E’s season-opening race in Hong Kong on Saturday despite the Briton being forced to serve a drive-through penalty after crashing his all-electric DS-Virgin Racing car in the pit lane.
The 30-year-old claimed a sixth career win by 11.575 seconds from pole winner Jean-Eric Vergne following the incident when switching to his second car.
Bird was penalized for not stopping in the garage, but retained his lead after his drive-through as season four of the series began in dramatic fashion around the harbourside streets.
“That was very stressful,” said the driver, who had to see stewards afterwards and will have a 10-place grid penalty for Sunday’s second race.
”I‘m finding it hard to process what happened as it’s not very often you win after a drive-through penalty in FE. I’m amazed to have won really.
“I thought I’d come out P7 (seventh) or P8 and I got on the radio asking what position I was in. They said ‘You’re in P1, keep going’...I never expected we’d dominate round one, but I’ll take that.”
Bird took the lead just before his pit-stop on the 43-lap race, cutting past Vergne’s Techeetah car at a chicane on the 1.86km circuit.
But he overshot his stop and rammed into the side of the Virgin garage, forcing a couple of team personnel to jump out of the way.
The short pit lane helped him emerge just ahead of Vergne and Germany’s Nick Heidfeld, who were scrapping for second place.
“I hit quite a lot going into the garage,” Bird added. “The pit-lane is really filthy dirty and I tried to attack my pit-box as they have given us an almost impossible amount of time to do the pit-stop. But the car just went straight.”
Frenchman Vergne, a former Toro Rosso Formula One driver who claimed his maiden win in season three’s finale in Montreal, struggled with a lack of information about his energy levels but held onto second place.
“This race was my most difficult,” he said. “Finishing second is more like a win for us. For the long term thinking of the championship sometimes you have to finish second, third or fourth and just take the points.”
The series’ had its first red flag in 35 races after a four-car log-jam on the opening lap and the race was suspended for more than 30 minutes before resuming under the safety car.


BERLIN (Reuters) - Adidas expects a big increase in sales of soccer jerseys from the 2018 World Cup in Russia helped by its sponsorship of three of the top teams, the German sportswear maker’s chief executive was quoted as saying on Saturday.
“In football, we are the clear market leader worldwide and are sponsoring 11 teams at the World Cup next year,” Kasper Rorsted told the Rheinische Post newspaper in an interview.
“Overall, I expect a big increase in Adidas jersey sales in 2018 because of the World Cup. I hope that our teams go as far as possible. After all, we are kitting out three of the favorites with Germany, Spain and Argentina.”
Adidas is the official sponsor of the World Cup and has long been the top supplier of soccer shirts, shoes and balls.
But at the 2014 World Cup in Brazil, arch rival Nike sponsored more teams for the first time, including the hosts, and signed more of the most marketable players.
Adidas has since enjoyed a big comeback, taking market share from Nike in the United States, and revamping its soccer business. It is back in the lead with the most teams sponsored at the World Cup, including hosts Russia.
Nike’s top teams at the World Cup include France and Brazil, which is joint favorite with Germany to win, while sportswear firm Puma has only two sides in the tournament - Uruguay and Switzerland, down from eight in 2014.
Rorsted said Adidas should not focus too much on Nike.
“This is not a tennis match with two players, where only one can be victorious. We are focusing on our own business and always improving. It makes no sense to declare our main goal as beating Nike,” he said.


ANAHEIM (Reuters) - The United States’ long wait for a men’s weightlifting World Championships medal goes on after their big hope, teenager Clarence ‘CJ’ Cummings, failed to register a total on Friday.
The 17-year-old, a four times world champion at youth and junior level, failed in all three clean and jerk attempts in the 69 kilograms class, which was won by South Korean Won Jeong-sik with a total of 326kg. Tairat Bunsuk of Thailand was second (321kg) and Frenchman Bernardin Matam third (318).
Tunisian Karem Ben Hnia, who topped the rankings and had been expected to challenge for gold, also failed to register a total.
The last American man to win a World Championships medal was Wes Barnett, who was third in the now defunct 108kg class in 1997. Cummings was seen as the leading contender to end the 20-year wait.
Mattie Rogers, in Saturday’s 69 kg, and Sarah Robles in Tuesday’s super-heavyweights, are the top female medal contenders for the host nation.
The first European winner of the Championships, Romania’s Loredana-Elena Toma, timed her victory well in the women’s 63 kg class as it came on National Day in her homeland.
Toma, the European champion, was a clear winner on 237kg ahead of two Colombians, Lina Rivas and Mercedes Perez.


(Reuters) - Jordan Zunic fired 11 birdies in 16 holes on his way to matching the course record with an eight-under 64 before a late lapse left him three shots clear after the third round of the Australian PGA Championship on Saturday.
The 25-year-old, who won the 2015 New Zealand Open shortly after turning professional, was well on target for an even more remarkable round until he dropped three shots on his final two holes at the Royal Pines Resort in Queensland.
Zunic sits on 17-under for the tournament with one round remaining, while fellow Australian and playing partner Cameron Smith is alone in second after shooting a five-under 67 in the co-sanctioned Australasian and European Tour event.
Second round leader Adam Bland is a further shot back in third after the left-hander signed for a one-under 71. Fellow Australians David Bransdon (66) and Marc Leishman (74) are tied for fourth at 10-under 206.
”Obviously not the way I planned to finish,“ Zunic told reporters. ”It was 16 amazing holes and to be honest I didn’t think I did anything too wrong in the final two holes.
“It was an unbelievable day out there.”
Zunic, who was involved in a near-fatal car crash in the United States four years ago that left him with serious head and elbow injuries, played impeccable golf until the 17th where he produced a bogey-five.
He had made seven birdies on the front nine, including four in a row from the sixth, before making four more successive birdies from the 13th.
His storming run was halted on the penultimate hole before he found a fairway bunker on 18 and needed two putts to get down for a double-bogey six, while Smith saved par after a superb greenside chip left him less than two meters from the pin.
”He put on a bit of display for the first 13 or 14 holes,“ Smith said of Zunic’s round. ”It was pretty incredible to watch and he was just a magician on the greens, I think he only had 15 putts in the first 14 holes.
“But I didn’t let Jordan’s round get ahead of me and kept on doing what I was doing. I knew I was playing well and putting well and made the most of my chances.”
U.S. Masters champion Sergio Garcia was alone in seventh on eight-under 208 after shooting 70, the Spaniard mixing four birdies with two bogeys.
The final round will begin early on Sunday due to predicted thunderstorms for the Gold Coast region later in the day.


(Reuters) - Simone Biles recently resumed training for the first time in over a year with her eyes set squarely on the 2020 Tokyo Olympics where one of the greatest gymnasts of all time expects to be a mentor on the U.S. team.
Biles, whose four gold medals at the 2016 Rio Games capped a run of dominance unlike anything the gymnastics world has seen, did not say whether she felt she could repeat that success in Tokyo but did acknowledge her changing role.
“It’s very important to be a mentor, especially if we have any newcomers and to show them the ropes and tell them that it’s going to be okay and boost their confidence on a stage that large,” Biles, 20, said in a telephone interview from Cincinnati on Friday.
“So I feel like that’s my role going into these next few years, being a mentor during championships and worlds and all of those international meets before the Games again.”
Biles has been an elite gymnast since 2011 and after taking a break to enjoy life away from the gym, she is now training and planning to make her return at the U.S. Classic in late July.
She will compete on the balance beam and uneven bars when she makes her competitive comeback but will add floor and vault a few weeks later at the national championships.
According to Biles, she still has all her skills and while getting back to her routine was not incredibly hard it did come with its fair share of challenges.
“The first day (back) I was doing some skills and it was going pretty smoothly but then it all catches up to you and by the third day I could barely walk. So that was no fun,” said Biles. “But now it’s been pretty good.”
For Biles, her plan all along was to take time off exploring the world with family and friends after Rio with the ultimate goal of returning fresher, both physically and mentally, before resuming training.
By the time the Tokyo Olympics roll around Biles will be 23, which is considered rather old by elite women’s gymnastics standards, but she is not letting that deter her.
She hopes that by having avoided for over a year the wear and tear that intense training takes on a body it will allow her to continue competing at a high level for a few more years.
Biles said she expects the Tokyo Games to be her final competition and while she would love to go out on top she was not ready to unveil her goals.
“It’s kind of hard to set a bar only because I know what other people expect and what I have set for myself and sometimes that doesn’t link up eye to eye,” said Biles, who is promoting Hershey’s Gold, the fourth flavor unveiled in the history of the chocolate maker.
”So it’s kind of like finding the balance between pleasing everybody and also doing what I love to do and making my goals.
“But it’s also very different because I am older, it’ll be a new time coming, the rules have changed a little bit as well so we will just have to see.”

LONDON (Reuters) - Alfa Romeo’s return to Formula One shows the value of the sport and suggests Ferrari will not follow through on threats to leave, according to Red Bull principal Christian Horner.
Alfa Romeo is part of the Fiat Chrysler group whose chief executive Sergio Marchionne is also the head of sportscar maker Ferrari, who are Formula One’s most successful and glamorous team.
The Swiss Sauber team announced on Thursday that the Italian marque was returning to the sport as their title sponsor after a 30-year absence, with the team to be known as Alfa Romeo Sauber F1 from next season.
“They (Alfa) come under the same management as Sergio so I can’t believe he’d have brought Alfa Romeo in for Ferrari to be leaving in a couple of years,” Horner told Reuters.
“I think it demonstrates that Formula One is obviously working and creating the recognition, otherwise the group wouldn’t have brought the Alfa brand into Formula One,” he added.
Alfa has a long history in motor racing, from pre-World War Two days to the winning the first two Formula One drivers’ championships in 1950 and 1951. Enzo Ferrari worked for them  before building his first car in 1947.
Marchionne warned in November that Ferrari, who were spun off from Fiat Chrysler at the start of last year, could walk away if the sport took a direction contrary to the company’s interests.
He will attend an Alfa Romeo Sauber presentation in Arese, near Milan, on Saturday.
Horner, who was speaking at the launch of the Aston Martin R-Motorsport sportscar team in London on Thursday, has previously dismissed Marchionne’s comments as ‘bluster’.
“Formula One needs Ferrari and Ferrari needs Formula One. It’s a marriage of convenience in many respects but both entities ultimately need each other. And we certainly want Ferrari in Formula One,” he said.
“A Formula One with Ferrari in, it’s one of the biggest brands in the world and they are a great team to compete against.”
Sauber will use Ferrari engines next year, along with the U.S.-owned Haas team and Ferrari’s works outfit.
Red Bull are one of three using Renault power units but the future is clouded by uncertainty, with the engine regulations set for a change in 2021.
Aston Martin will be Red Bull’s title sponsors next season and chief executive Andy Palmer has spoken of the possibility of the British sportscar company eventually building an engine if the rules provide for a much cheaper and simpler unit.
“Liberty (the Formula One owners) are very keen to reduce costs to simplify the engine and to attract new brands into Formula One,” said Horner.
”Aston are extremely keen to have an increased presence and I think we’re all in a little bit of a holding pattern at the moment waiting to see what are those regulations going to be.
“You’d have to partner with a specialist, and research and development cost resource restrictions would have to be in place in order for there to be a playing field that they could compete on,” he added.

(Reuters) - Canada’s minister of sport is pushing for Calgary to bid for the 2026 Winter Olympics and said the legacy from the last time the western Canadian city hosted the Games was worth it, according to a CBC report on Friday.
At a time when many cities have pulled out of Olympics bids given concerns about massive costs, Canadian sports minister Kent Hehr told CBC he feels the 1988 Winter Games host would benefit from doing it again.
”I know an Olympic bid, deep in my heart, would be something that would be extraordinary,“ Hehr said in the report. ”But you have to balance it in a real way.
“We’re always excited when communities like Calgary are thinking about putting their hat in the ring about bringing the Olympic Games to this nation.”
Cities around the world are no longer clamoring to host an Olympics. Many in recent years have removed themselves from consideration, either scared off by the size and cost of the Games or pressured by local opposition.
Calgary’s city council recently voted to give C$1 million to continue research into bidding to host the 2026 Games. A bid exploration committee has estimated that staging the sporting extravaganza would come with a price tag of about C$4.6 billion.
According to Hehr, there was plenty of economic uncertainty in Calgary during the late 1970s and early 1980s and many people who did not want the city to host the Olympics.
“There were lots of naysayers around that as well,” Hehr told CBC. “But the legacy that was left, the opportunities it gave kids in the community to develop, I think were well worth the angst and the time.”
According to the CBC article, while Hehr feels an Olympics in Calgary would offer a sense of pride to all of Canada, he continues to maintain a balanced and measured approach.
“Of course you look at all of the possibilities and they’re exciting but you have to look at it in a real fashion. Do the numbers make sense too? Will this lead your community in a better place given all the intangibles surrounding the Olympic bid?”


EINDHOVEN, Netherlands (Reuters) - Amid the flurry of doping and corruption scandals which have hit sport over the last few years, it is often asked why athletes do not make more use their influence to force change. Brazil is a rare case where they can claim to have done so.
Latin America’s largest nation has suffered more than its fair share of sports-related scandal.
The former head of the Brazilian Olympic Committee (COB), Carlos Nuzman, is to stand trial for his role in a corruption case involving alleged bribery in Rio de Janeiro’s successful bid to host of the 2016 Games. Nuzman has denied wrongdoing.
Five Brazilians are among several dozen former soccer officials and sports marketing executives who were indicted in the United States in 2015 in a case which plunged global soccer body FIFA into its worst ever crisis.
Meanwhile, many of the venues used at the 2014 World Cup and 2016 Olympic Games had fallen into neglect.
But behind the scenes, changes are taking place.
Four years ago, Brazil’s Senate passed a bill that placed a two-term limit on the mandates of presidents sporting confederations which receive public funding.
It also obliged the federations to publish their annual accounts and include athletes in the decision-making process.
Those changes, considered hugely significant in a country where some officials have clung to power for decades, were forced through after intense lobbying from a group called “Atletas pelo Brasil” (Athletes for Brasil).
Founded in 2006, their members include some of Brazil’s most famous former athletes like volleyball player Ana Moser, Formula One’s Rubens Barrichello, former Brazil soccer captain Cafu, basketball player Oscar Schmidt and middle-distance athlete Joaquim Cruz.
Its president is Rai Oliveira, a member of Brazil’s World Cup winning team in 1994, and the younger brother of the late Socrates who was regarded as one of the finest footballers the country has ever produced.
“We have 67 athletes from different generations and different sports, men and women, I think that makes us unique maybe in the world,” he told Reuters on the sidelines of the Play the Game sports conference.
“It’s certainly a pioneering imitative in Brazil where athletes don’t have a culture of taking a stand and starting a movement.”
Rai said his organization scored another victory in 2015 when some of Brazil’s biggest companies agreed that sponsorship money would only be made available to federations which meet high levels of transparency and governance.
“The surprising thing was that even rivals companies got together,” he said. “A lot of company directors like sport and that helped us achieve it. They also realized there was no point in one company doing not if others did not follow suit.”
Rai said that 27 companies have so far signed the so-called Pact for Sport, representing 60 percent of total sports sponsorship money in Brazil.
The big exception have been sponsors involved in soccer but Rai said negotiations were continuing with them as well.
The latest battle is to force a change in COB statutes which would give athletes one third of the votes in its electoral college. A vote was postponed on Monday and is due to take place in December.
Rai recognized that there was still a long way to go and said the Olympic legacy was a setback.
”What was left? Abandoned Olympic venues, white elephants, lack of planning for the next Olympic cycles, decrease in public spending for sports...“ he said. ”But today, we have a voice, we are respected and we are being called to attend important discussions.
”We know the big fight is still to be won... we want better sports in our schools, better sports for all, better
governance.
“Our goal is to have a country where everyone can have access to sports - we put the bar very high.”


LAUSANNE (Reuters) - The International Olympic Committee (IOC) said on Friday it had banned two Russian cross-country skiers, Yulia Chekaleva and Anastasia Dotsenko, and Russian biathlete Olga Zaytseva for life from the Olympics over Sochi 2014 doping allegations.
The IOC is re-testing all Russian athletes’ samples from the event after Grigory Rodchenkov, the former head of Moscow’s discredited anti-doping laboratory, blew the whistle on what he said was a state-sponsored doping program.
The three Russian athletes are found to have committed anti-doping rule violations at the Winter Olympics in Sochi and are disqualified from the events in which they participated, the IOC statement said.
Chekaleva and Dotsenko competed but did not win medals in Sochi. Zaytseva won the silver medal in a four-woman race.
The number of cases opened by the Disciplinary Commission has reached 36 after additional findings from the re-analyses, the IOC said.
The head of the Russian Ski Race Federation, Elena Vyalbe, said the IOC decisions would be appealed in the Court of Arbitration for Sport in Lausanne, the RIA news agency reported.
Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev has said that  allegations that Russian athletes used doping during the 2014 Sochi Olympics are “political manipulations” in a new anti-Russian campaign.


MOSCOW (Reuters) - FIFA President Gianni Infantino on Friday dodged questions about the alleged existence of a state-sponsored doping program in Russia, the host country of next year’s World Cup finals that has dismissed the allegations.
Infantino was speaking alongside Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko, who also serves as the head of the Russian Football Union and the chairman of the tournament’s local organizing committee, ahead of the World Cup draw at the Kremlin.
“FIFA doesn’t participate in any speculations about any situation,” he said, referring to allegations of state-sponsored doping in Russia that could see the country banned from the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics in February.
Infantino said FIFA was testing players in and out of competition and that all tests from the 2017 Confederations Cup, the 2016 European championship and the 2014 World Cup had proven negative.
“These tests are not carried out in Russia and they are carried out by non-Russians,” Infantino told reporters.
“Obviously, as it was the case in the past and as will be the case in the future as well, if it turns out that anyone has committed a doping violation, has taken some doping, then there will be sanctions.”
Infantino added that the International Olympic Committee’s (IOC) decision next week on Russia’s participation at the winter Games would have no impact on the World Cup, which will take place in 12 venues spread across 11 cities including Moscow, St Petersburg and Sochi.
Mutko vehemently denied the existence of state-backed doping in Russia and said the country was being unfairly targeted by international sports authorities.
“I am ready to go to any court, to any disciplinary body and say that there was never, isn’t and never will be any doping cover up program,” Mutko said. “We don’t need any of this.”
Despite pledges to cooperate with international bodies to help rid Russia of deep-seated doping, the authorities have refused to acknowledge the findings of last year’s McLaren report that a state-sponsored program existed.
That refusal has thwarted Russia’s efforts to have its suspended sports organizations reinstated.
The country’s athletics federation, Paralympic committee and anti-doping agency RUSADA all remain suspended over doping scandals.
The report, commissioned by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), found that more than 1,000 Russian competitors in more than 30 sports were involved in a conspiracy to conceal positive drug tests over a period of five years.
“There can be endless accusations,” Mutko said. “But I can say that we didn’t create doping.”
Mutko stressed that Russia would continue to protect its athletes and fight the recent bans against suspected dope cheats.
“The state will take a firm position and will defend its athletes until the bitter end,” he said. “We trust and believe them. We will go to civil courts. We won’t leave things like this.”
The IOC last month banned more than 20 Russian athletes as part of an investigation into alleged sample tampering by laboratory and security officials at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi.


(Reuters) - Marc Leishman and Adam Bland carved out a two-stroke lead at the top of the leaderboard after the second round of the Australian PGA Championship on Friday as former winner Adam Scott’s campaign came to an end.
Local hero Leishman struck seven birdies and an eagle in a round of seven-under-par 65 to be level on 12-under with Adam Bland who hit a second consecutive six-under 66.
“I felt really good on the range and felt good yesterday as well. I was striking the ball well and thought I would be pretty aggressive all day, especially after making birdies on the first couple of holes,” said Leishman, who had birdies on three of his first five holes.
“When you’re on a run like that and playing well, you sort of can afford to be aggressive. If you make a few mistakes, you feel like you can make some birdies.”
South Australian Bland had just one bogey in his seven birdies on Friday.
“It’s always great to get off to a flying start but if you can’t back it up in the second round or at least be thereabouts, you’re kind of just chasing your tail for the rest of the week,” Bland said.
“So it was really important to get off to a good start this morning and I seemed to do that, so it was great.”
Former world number one Scott had four bogeys in five holes to card a dismal two-over 74 and failed to make the cut at Queensland while U.S. Masters champion Sergio Garcia fell to joint-10th with a one-under 71.
Cameron Smith, early leader Jordan Zunic and Rhein Gibson were tied for fourth at nine-under.
Defending champion Harold Varner III was a further two shots behind in joint-seventh alongside James Nitties and Brett Rankin.
Garcia, Joachim Hansen, Peter Senior and Hong Kong Open winner Wade Ormsby were 10th at six-under. Varner, Garcia and Hansen were the only non-Australians in the top 10 heading into the weekend.


(Reuters) - The Seattle Sounders eased to a 3-0 victory over the Houston Dynamo in the second leg of their Major League Soccer Western Conference Championship on Thursday to set up a rematch of last year’s MLS Cup final against Toronto FC.
The defending champions will travel to Toronto for the Dec. 9 final after dispatching Houston 5-0 on aggregate, cruising to victory over a weakened Dynamo side, who were reduced to 10 men after 66 minutes and missing ailing marksman Romell Quioto.
“It’s a tremendous opportunity,” Sounders goalkeeper Stefan Frei told reporters of the chance to repeat as champions against top-seeded Toronto. “We’re going to give it our best shot to take advantage of it.”
The second-seeded Sounders were barely pushed by the fourth-seeded Dynamo as Seattle managed to avoid conceding a goal for an MLS-record sixth straight post-season tie and extended their unbeaten home streak to 15 games.
Seattle’s last home loss came at the hands of Toronto FC on May 1 but they will need to travel to Canada for the final due to their opponent’s superior regular-season record.
Victor Rodriguez opened the scoring for the Sounders at the mid-point of the first half when he lifted a deft chip over Houston keeper Joe Willis and Clint Dempsey doubled the lead in the 57th minute, tapping in a low cross from Joevin Jones.
Will Bruin completed the rout with another chip past an out-rushing Willis in the 73rd minute to send the 45,298 green-clad Seattle fans into a frenzy on a cool and clear evening.
Houston’s main threat came from Tomas Martinez, who had two smart shots saved by Frei late in the first half before he was dismissed after the break for shoving Jordy Delem on the back of the head while the Seattle midfielder was lying on the ground.
The pair had made initial contact while jumping for a high ball and the red card came after a video review of the incident by the referee.


(The Sports Xchange) - Highlights of Thursday’s National Basketball Association games:
Cavaliers 121, Hawks 114
Cleveland’s defense wasn’t what it had been during most of its winning streak, but a season-best 18 3-pointers in 39 attempts were enough to carry the Cavaliers past the Atlanta Hawks 121-114 on Thursday for their 10th consecutive victory.
Kevin Love had 25 points and 16 rebounds, and LeBron James had 24 points and 12 assists as Cleveland held on despite a scare from Atlanta.
The Hawks, down by 12 points late in the third quarter, closed to 113-112 on two free throws by Ersan Ilyasova, but James hit a 3-pointer with just under two minutes left to help the Cavaliers regain control.
Dennis Schroder had 27 points and Ilyasova 22 for Atlanta.
Celtics 108, 76ers 97
Kyrie Irving scored 36 points to power Boston over undermanned but feisty Philadelphia.
Irving and Marcus Morris keyed a 17-7 fourth-quarter run that broke the game open and gave the Celtics a ninth win in their last 10 home games. It was also the seventh straight TD Garden victory for Boston over the 76ers.
The Celtics’ Al Horford had 21 points, eight rebounds and five assists. Morris finished with 17 points off the bench, one off his season high. He scored six straight points late in the third quarter and seven more during the fourth-quarter spurt.
Dario Saric led Philadelphia with 18 points and 10 rebounds.
Nuggets 111, Bulls 110
Will Barton hit a driving layup with 3.2 seconds left to finish with a career-high 37 points, and Denver overcame Nikola Jokic’s ankle injury to pull out a win over Chicago.
Barton scored six points in the final 45 seconds to rescue the Nuggets against the team with the worst record in the NBA. Gary Harris scored 21 for Denver.
Jokic was hurt with 44 seconds left in the first half. He went to the locker room for X-rays and didn’t return. Lauri Markkanen had 20 points and nine rebounds, Robin Lopez also scored 20 and Kris Dunn had 19 points for the Bulls, who lost their seventh straight game.
Jazz 126, Clippers 107
Alec Burks scored 28 points, and Donovan Mitchell added 24 as Utah moved their win streak to four games with a victory over Los Angeles.
The Jazz improved to 2-7 away from home this year, with the other victory coming at Orlando on Nov. 18. It was only the fourth time Utah defeated the Clippers in the past 23 meetings.
Austin Rivers scored a season-high 25 points for Los Angeles, which saw its three-game win streak come to an end. Lou Williams scored 20 points for the Clippers, while DeAndre Jordan grabbed 16 rebounds and added eight points.
Bucks 103, Trail Blazers 91
Khris Middleton scored 26 points and Eric Bledsoe added 25 as Milwaukee defeated Portland.
Giannis Antetokounmpo contributed 20 points, nine rebounds, five assists and three blocked shots for the Bucks. Bledsoe scored 17 points on 8-of-10 shooting to lead Milwaukee to a 60-45 halftime edge.


MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia will host the 2018 World Cup draw on Friday, the glittering ceremony providing a welcome distraction to the unrelenting diet of doping and corruption news that has sullied the nation’s sporting reputation in recent years.
The draw ceremony gives Russia the chance to showcase the cities and stadiums that will host the 32 teams next June and July. Former England striker Gary Lineker, the 1986 World Cup’s Golden Boot winner as leading goalscorer, and Russian sports journalist Maria Komandnaya are the main presenters.
In a new simplified format, the teams will be placed in pots one to four from highest to lowest FIFA ranking with the exception of Russia, the lowest-ranked team in the tournament, who are automatically in pot one alongside the top seeds.
Each pot will be emptied one by one into eight groups which will contain four teams each. Two non-European teams from the same confederation cannot be in the same group to avoid geographic clashes.
With 14 qualified European teams there cannot be more than two European teams in the same group.
“Really to be honest, if you are going to win the World Cup, it doesn’t matter who comes out of that draw,” draw assistant Gordon Banks, who won the 1966 World Cup with England, told reporters on Thursday at the Kremlin.
“Because you’ve got to get out there and you’ve got to play the best you can. Play as a team and keep going, and that’s what we did when we won it.”
While the draw ceremony, which the Kremlin said President Vladimir Putin could attend, will focus on the positive aspects of the tournament, it will also serve as a reminder of the potential problems, notably concerns over racist and discriminatory behavior and hooliganism.
FIFA President Gianni Infantino warned this week that referees will have the power to stop or even abandon World Cup matches if such incidents take place.
The authorities have said that World Cup preparations are generally on track but there have been construction delays, including on the new stadium in Samara.
Work on the 45,000-seat venue, which will host four group matches, a game in the round-of-16 and a quarter-final, has been plagued by delays over recent months.
Authorities have promised that the venue will be completed on time.
FIFA said around 750,000 tickets have been allocated in the first phase of sales, with the second phase beginning next week.
Russian fans have acquired the most tickets followed by American supporters even though their team did not qualify for the tournament. Brazil, Germany, China and Mexico are also among the leading nations for purchases, FIFA said.
“We’re happy with the number of tickets we’ve allocated,” Falk Eller, the head of FIFA ticketing, told Reuters.
“Of course, we are also glad that the operation went quite well, no technical glitches, no problems.”
All World Cup ticket holders are required to obtain a personalized fan-ID, allowing authorities to screen them and keep hooligans away from matches.


LONDON (Reuters) - Olympic champion Eliud Kipchoge will seek to complete a hat-trick of London Marathon victories next year after missing the 2017 event to focus on his Breaking2 sub-two hour bid, organizers said on Thursday.
The 33-year-old Kenyan won the 2015 race and finished eight seconds outside Dennis Kimetto’s world record time of 2:02:57 to triumph again 12 months later, but he did not defend his title this year to instead focus on the Nike Breaking2 project.
In that event he ran two hours and 25 seconds, though that time is not an official world record due to aspects of the event not satisfying IAAF criteria..
The former 5,000 meters world champion’s official best marathon time of 2:03:05 set in London in 2016 is the fourth-fastest in history. He came close to the world record again in Berlin this year, clocking 2:03:32 in damp conditions..
As always, questions about a potential world record were top of the agenda as Kipchoge held a conference call with journalists on Thursday. The last six world records were set at Berlin, with London last producing one in 2002 when Khalid Khannouchi ran 2:05.38.
“First of all I race to win but London is a good course, world records can be broken here. Remember last year I missed it by a few seconds so London is truly a place to break a world record,” he said.
”Berlin was difficult because the weather was not good but my time showed I was in the right shape. As ever with marathon running, everything needs to come right on the day.
“I know that I have the world record in me so we will have to wait and see what happens.”
Although most of the rest of the elite field is yet to be announced one name already inked in is that of Briton Mo Farah, having his second attempt at the distance but first after stepping away from his track career.
Farah ran 2:08.21 in 2014 and would need a major improvement to challenge for the title next year.
Kipchoge, who has won all but one of the marathons he has raced since stepping up from the track in 2013, said he expected a strong showing from the home favorite.
“It does take time to make that switch but I’m sure Mo will be successful. Mo is a legend and has responded to all sorts of pressure before,” he said.
“It’s great he will be racing the London Marathon next year because I’m sure that will make the atmosphere even more special.”


ZURICH (Reuters) - Russian sprinter Yulia Gushchina, who has previously been stripped of three relay medals won in the 2008 and 2012 Olympics after team mates were banned for doping, has also been disqualified from the London Games after testing positive, the International Olympic Committee said on Thursday.
Re-analysis of Gushchina’s samples from London resulted in a positive test for banned substances dehydrochlormethyltestosterone and stanozolol, the IOC said in a statement, the latest sanction as it re-tests samples from Russian athletes.
Gushchina, who failed to make the final in the individual 400m in London, helped Russia to a silver medal in the 4x400m relay but the quartet were stripped of the honor after Antonina Krivoshapka was banned retrospectively earlier this year.
In Beijing four years earlier she won gold in the 4x100 and silver in the 4x400 but had those results annulled after positive tests for team mates.
The IOC also said on Thursday that Russian long jumper Anna Nazarova had failed a retrospective test from 2012, where she finished fifth.
Thursday’s announcements were the latest in a stream of recent doping positives from the summer and winter Olympics, the vast majority of them Russians.
Russia’s athletics federation is currently banned from the sport as is its Paralympic Committee and anti-doping organization in the wake of widespread doping offences and cover-ups.
The IOC has said it will decide during its executive board meeting next month on the participation of Russian competitors at the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics in South Korea in February.


EINDHOVEN, Netherlands (Reuters) - Allowing Russia to compete at the 2018 Winter Games would be “a missed opportunity” which would raise doubts about sport’s willingness to root out drug cheats, the head of the umbrella group of national anti-doping agencies told Reuters.
The International Olympic Committee (IOC) is due to decide next week whether Russia can take part in Pyeongchang and iNADO chief executive Joseph de Pencier said that its decision would be critical to anti-doping efforts.
A World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report by Canadian law professor Richard McLaren published last year found evidence of widespread, systematic doping across Russian sport.
Russia has repeatedly denied state involvement in doping and on Wednesday the Kremlin said bans on the country’s athletes were part of an anti-Russian campaign in the West.
“If they don’t exclude the Russian Olympic Committee, then I think it’s a huge mistake and a wasted opportunity,” De Pencier said on the sidelines of a sports conference.
”It’s obviously a critical decision for the IOC. If the IOC get this wrong, they set back the work of all of us.
”They create doubts about clean sport and the willingness of the anti-doping community to make sure the job is done, and the commitment of sport as a whole to clean competition and clean athletes.
“If that happens, my members are going to be dealing with their governments, their press and their public asking how they can believe in clean sport.”
De Pencier said he could accept an arrangement where Russian athletes competed as neutrals as “something we can live with” but personally preferred a blanket ban, even if it meant innocent athletes suffered the consequences.
Dmitry Svishchev, who is head of the Russian curling federation and serves on the Russian parliament’s sport and physical culture committee, urged the IOC “not to go for provocation”.
“We admit that there are some athletes, like anywhere in the world, who have taken banned substances. They need to be punished for this,” he told Reuters.
“But in no case should the whole national team, all the athletes who are preparing for the Olympic Games, all the spectators and fans of the Russian team be punished for the actions of some individuals.”
With Russia hosting next year’s soccer World Cup, De Pencier urged FIFA to “get to the bottom” of its own investigation into an allegation in the McLaren report that soccer was among the sports involved in doping.
“FIFA absolutely has to investigate this as an urgent matter and they have got to do it in good faith and with a will. Otherwise, they run the risk of having a big cloud over their event,” he said
“They have every incentive to get to the bottom of this and do it as quickly as possible.”
He added that FIFA should not be afraid of expelling Russia from its own tournament.
“Any multi-national sporting competition can carry on without a particular country being there, why couldn’t the World Cup in Russia? I acknowledge as a practical matter it’s hard to imagine that scenario and also the consequences that might cause, but why not?” he said.
Russia’s Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko this month described allegations of doping in Russian soccer as “stupidity”.
FIFA said in a statement to Reuters that it was working in close collaboration with WADA “following their guidance and exploring every possible avenue.” It said it wanted the investigation finished quickly but that “robust procedures take time.”
FIFA said it had undertaken “comprehensive actions to identify potential anti-doping rule violations including retesting of all available samples” and that investigations remain open.


EINDHOVEN, Netherlands (Reuters) - The NFL’s Rooney Rule could be a way of bringing greater racial and ethnic diversity to European soccer coaching, campaigners said, as a new survey confirmed that it remains a white, male preserve.
The Rooney Rule was introduced in the NFL in 2003 and obliged clubs to interview at least one candidate for every senior head coach role at its members clubs.
A study published by Britain’s Loughborough University and the Football Against Racism in Europe (FARE) group on Thursday found that only 4.6 percent of coaches from black and ethnic minorities (BAME) occupied senior coaching roles at England’s 92 professional soccer clubs.
It described the numbers as “disappointingly low” and added that “institutionally embedded barriers which have restricted opportunities for BAME coaches in the past” remained firmly in place.
The results were an update of a survey in 2014 which found that 96.6 percent of senior coaches at clubs in England, Germany, Spain, Belgium, France and the Netherlands were white men.
FARE executive director Piara Powar said that, given that around 30 percent of players in England and 40 percent in France and the Netherlands were from a BAME background,  “the numbers don’t add up”.
“(BAME) coaches are investing time and money, they are expressing their willingness to take on responsible roles at the top level,” he told Reuters on the sidelines of a sports conference.
“But it seems that at club level, owners are not prepared to give them the opportunity.”    Powar said it was not only an issue of discrimination but also performance.
“No football team can afford to miss out on coaching talent,” he said. “If you look at the professional structures in Western Europe... marginal gains are being talked about, the importance of one, two or three points at the end of the season, so why would owners and associations not look at recruiting the best talent regardless of the ethnic background?”
Powar said that the Rooney rule could improve the situation especially in countries such as England, France, the Netherlands and Portugal.
“If it’s applied in the way that it is in the United States, with the back up the NFL has created, then it will work,” he said. “It will be seen as something that is very normal and is bringing forward the best talent.”
Jeremy Duri, professor of sports law at the American university in Washington, said the number of non-white NFL coaches went from one to three and then nine before settling between six and eight after the rule was implemented.
“Those who got the opportunity won, they were successful,” he said.
“Since 2007, ten of 20 teams who reached the Superbowl final had a coach of color or general manager of color. The fact they were winning created a business case for diversity.”


(Reuters) - Sao Paulo’s first Formula E race has been postponed to 2019  because the Brazilian city’s authorities are in the process of selling off the planned venue.
“The Sao Paulo city authorities have asked us to postpone the race to season five, due to an ongoing process of privatization of the Anhembi Park venue,” said a spokesperson for the all-electric series on Thursday.
“Racing in city centers always poses challenges and as this process is taking longer than expected, in agreement with the city of Sao Paulo, we’ve decided to place negotiations on stand-by until the privatization process is complete.”
Formula E’s fourth season starts in Hong Kong on Saturday, with Sao Paulo originally scheduled for March 17 next year as the fifth round of the 14 race season.
Brazil currently has two Formula E drivers with the inaugural champion Nelson Piquet Junior and title holder Lucas di Grassi.
The Sao Paulo race was one of four new venues on the calendar along with Rome, Zurich and the Chilean capital of Santiago.
Formula E said a replacement for the Brazilian round would be presented to the governing International Automobile Federation (FIA) in Paris next week.
Sao Paulo city authorities are also in the process of privatizing the Interlagos circuit that hosts the Brazilian Formula One Grand Prix.


(Reuters) - U.S. Masters Champion Sergio Garcia carded a bogey-free, five-under-par 67 at the Australian PGA Championships in Queensland on Thursday to trail local pair Jordan Zunic and Adam Bland by a single stroke after the opening round.
Bland surged to the top of the leaderboard with the help of six birdies in seven holes, while Zunic closed with an eagle-three on the par-five ninth to overtake Garcia, who had set the early clubhouse target at a rain-delayed Royal Pines.
The Spaniard, playing in Australia for the first time since 2010, is the only non-local in the top 14 and sits joint-third alongside Marc Leishman, Daniel Nisbet, Michael Wright and veteran Peter Senior.
“I wouldn’t say that it was amazing but it was good,” Garcia said after his round at the tournament co-sanctioned by the PGA Tour of Australasia and European Tour.
”The most positive thing for me would be to go a bogey-free round, which I didn’t realize until we got done.
“Hopefully I‘m able to do more of the same but every day’s a different story and it also depends on the weather. If it gets windy it can be quite tricky, this course.”
Former Australian Masters winner Senior announced his retirement in 2016 but returned to action on Thursday with a spotless round that included five birdies to match Garcia’s score.
Seven players, including Rhein Gibson, Greg Chalmers and Cameron Smith, were a further shot behind in joint-eighth.
Defending champion Harold Varner III, recent Hong Kong Open winner Wade Ormsby and 2013 U.S. Masters champion Adam Scott are well off the pace on one-under.


(Reuters) - Larry Nassar, the former USA Gymnastics team doctor, pleaded guilty in a Michigan court on Wednesday to additional counts of criminal sexual conduct for assaulting girls under the guise of medical treatment, Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette said.
Nassar, 54, appeared in Michigan’s Eaton County Circuit Court and pleaded guilty to three felony counts of first degree criminal sexual conduct.
He did not make a statement beyond briefly answering the judge’s questions, according to The Detroit News. Nassar’s attorneys did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Nassar was the team physician for the Michigan State University gymnastics and women’s crew teams, as well as an associate professor at MSU’s College of Osteopathic Medicine. He served as the USA Gymnastics physician through four Olympic Games.
Last week, Nassar pleaded guilty in nearby Ingham County to seven felony counts of first-degree criminal sexual conduct despite his earlier denials of wrongdoing..
Wednesday’s guilty pleas put an end to criminal sexual conduct charges brought by the Michigan Attorney General’s office against Nassar in Eaton and Ingham counties.
The Eaton County sentencing hearing will be held on Jan. 31.
The Ingham County sentencing hearing will be held on Jan. 12 when all of the 125 reported victims or their parents will be allowed to give victim impact statements.
Last week’s plea deal with prosecutors calls for a minimum prison sentence of 25 years but the judge could set the minimum as high as 40 years.
Nassar’s plea deal follows claims by two of the United States’ most decorated gymnasts, Aly Raisman and Gabby Douglas, that they had been sexually abused by the former USA Gymnastics team doctor.
Three-times Olympic gold medalist Douglas earlier this month said she was sexually abused by Nassar while Raisman, also a three-times gold medalist, made similar allegations in an interview with CBS News program “60 Minutes.”
During the Nov. 22 hearing, Nassar apologized and said it was time for his victims to begin healing, The Detroit News reported.

(Reuters) - Evergreen American Venus Williams has dismissed any notion of announcing her retirement anytime soon, saying she is eager to compete at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.
The 37-year-old had a successful year in the absence of her sister Serena through pregnancy, climbing to number five in the singles rankings after finishing runner-up at the Australian Open, Wimbledon and the WTA Finals.
The seven-time grand slam winner has competed in five previous Olympics tournaments, starting in 2000, and has won three golds in the women’s doubles event with Serena and one gold in the singles competition.
“I have no plans of stopping soon,” Williams told American magazine Entrepreneur. “It seems somehow that 2020 Tokyo is on the horizon. Isn’t that wild? I‘m trying to stick around for that.”
The Williams sisters along with ATP Tour veterans Roger Federer and Rafa Nadal have re-established their dominance at the top of the sport with Serena winning her 23rd grand slam title aged 35 at the 2017 Australian Open.
Spaniard Nadal, 31, reclaimed the men’s number one spot with six trophies this year, while 36-year-old Federer finished second after winning seven titles. The pair split the season’s four grand slams between them.
The sisters will resume their rivalry next season as Serena is expected to make a long-awaited return following the birth of her daughter in September.


(Reuters) - Tiger Woods will once again steal the spotlight at the Hero World Challenge in the Bahamas on Thursday, despite the elite field containing eight of the world’s top-10 golfers, as he embarks on what could be his final shot at a comeback.
The 14-times major champion, who is now ranked 1199, has not played since back spasms aborted his latest comeback 10 months ago and while various reports suggest he is swinging freely, no-one will know how he is until he has undergone several rounds in the heat of competition.
Woods experienced a similar false dawn at the same tournament last year after a 16-month hiatus for previous back surgeries and the initial reports were upbeat after he completed four rounds.
Yet two months later he succumbed to the reality of how bad his back was and further surgery followed in April, this time a spinal fusion procedure.
Numerous videos have since been posted on social media of Woods apparently swinging well but precious little has been heard since an initial upbeat statement from surgeon Richard Guyer after the procedure, while details from the Woods camp have been vague and generalized.
“If he is healthy and pain free then what’s possible completely changes, but everything is speculation at this point,” Golf Channel analyst Frank Nobilo told Reuters.
Nobilo’s fellow Golf Channel analyst Brandel Chamblee is not bullish on Woods.
“A bad back by a 41-year-old, four back surgeries in the last three or four years, followed by the emotional stress of the scandal and the controversies that have followed him around and likely some addictions, followed by the chipping yips, which various people have texted me, all caps, exclamation points, that he is over,” Chamblee told Golf.Com. 
“I’ve seen no evidence that he’s over it.”
But Chamblee nevertheless has been impressed with Woods’ swing during pre-tournament practice rounds this weeks, and said he would not be surprised if he posts a top-10 finish in the 18-man field this week.
Others are more bullish long term but one thing most agree on is that this is likely the last-chance for Woods, already at an age at which most injury-free golfers are past their prime.
“My prediction, he’ll come back in a blaze of glory,” six-times major champion Lee Trevino, who endured back issues throughout his career, told Golf World.
“He’s not too old, far from it. If he gets fixed, when he comes back to hitting and feels no pain, he’s going to be so happy, that he may be more dangerous than he was before.”
Trevino, however, added that it was all still supposition.
“Hey, if they couldn’t fix him, then it is over,” he said.
“You can only chase a rainbow so many times.”


LAUSANNE (Reuters) - The International Olympic Committee (IOC) said on Wednesday it had banned for life three Russian bobsledders - Aleksandr Kasyanov, Aleksei Pushkarev and Ilvir Khuzin - over doping allegations related to the 2014 Sochi Olympics.
The IOC is re-testing all Russian athletes’ samples from the event after Grigory Rodchenkov, the former head of Moscow’s discredited anti-doping laboratory, blew the whistle on what he said was a state-sponsored doping program.
Russia denies the allegations, saying it is the victim of a politicized dirty tricks campaign designed to besmirch its reputation and curb its sporting success.
The IOC’s latest move brings the total number of Russian athletes handed life bans to more than 20 this month.
The Kremlin earlier on Wednesday said it would act to protect the rights of Russian athletes, criticizing the bans as part of a broad anti-Russian campaign in the West.
“We strongly reject all allegations that the state may have been involved in any way in forcing doping on Russian athletes,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told a conference call with reporters.
Rodchenkov, who prosecutors in Russia accuse of forcing sportspeople to resort to doping, was “an odious figure in Russia”, Peskov said.
“Unfortunately, his sponsors and those sheltering him have a tin ear about this... And therefore the situation certainly remains complicated and the interests of our athletes suffer.”
Kasyanov, Pushkarev and Khuzin competed but did not win medals in Sochi, but were part of the team that won a four-man World Cup bobsleigh event last week.
The president of Russia’s bobsleigh federation, Alexander Zubkov, said the trio were “leaders of the national team” and accused international sports authorities of trying to weaken it.
“They will do everything possible for our country to go to the Olympics with a third or fourth-tier line-up,” Zubkov told a news conference in Moscow.
Zubkov was stripped last week of two gold medals from the 2014 Sochi Games and banned from the Olympics over doping. He says he is innocent and has vowed to appeal the bans against Russian bobsledders at the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS).
Zubkov’s lifetime ban from the Olympics also prevents him from being accredited to the 2018 winter Games in Pyeongchang, South Korea.
Zubkov said his absence from Pyeongchang would not affect the Russian bobsleigh team’s performance.
The IOC is set to decide next week on the participation of Russian competitors at next year’s Games.


TOKYO (Reuters) - Sumo grand champion Harumafuji announced he would retire on Wednesday to take responsibility for injuring a junior wrestler in an incident that has threatened to taint the image of Japan’s national sport just as it was regaining popularity.
The 33-year-old Mongolian-born “yokozuna” (grand champion) had already apologized earlier this month after media reported he had beaten junior wrestler Takanoiwa while drinking at a restaurant-bar with other wrestlers.
“As yokozuka I feel responsible for injuring Takanoiwa and so will retire from today,” a stern-faced Harumafuji told a news conference carried live by several Japanese broadcasters in Fukuoka, southern Japan, site of the most recent tournament.
“I apologize from my heart to the people, sumo fans, the Japan Sumo Association, to supporters of my ‘stable’ (gym) and my ‘oyakata’ (coach) and his wife for causing such trouble.”
Harumafuji gave no details of the incident -- still under investigation by police -- which media reports said occurred when he got angry because the younger wrestler was checking his smartphone after being chastised for a bad attitude.
Takanoiwa, 27, did not take part in the latest tournament due to his injuries, which the sumo association said included a  fractured skull and concussion.
“I think it is my duty as a senior wrestler to correct and teach junior wrestlers when they are lacking in manners and civility,” Harumafuji said. “But I went too far,” he said, adding that the commotion was not alcohol-fuelled.
The incident has highlighted sumo’s struggle to reform harsh conditions that can breed violence in its closed, hierarchical world, although some wrestlers say there have been improvements in the decade since a trainee was beaten to death.
“Sumo, recognizing its responsibility as the sport with the longest history in Japan, must stamp out violence so that the expectations of the people, including youth, are not again betrayed,” Education Minister Yoshimasa Hayashi, whose ministry oversees sports, said in a parliamentary committee meeting.
Former yokozuna Isegahama, the head of the gym where Harumafuji trains and his mentor since he arrived in Japan at the age of 16, told the news conference he had never seen the Mongolian engage in violence and the incident was regrettable.
But he added: “He (Harumafuji) is the one who is most to blame for harming the status of yokozuna. He shouldn’t blame others.”
The head of an advisory body to the JSA, the Yokozuna Deliberation Council, had said this week the affair warranted “extremely harsh punishment” but did not issue a final decision because both the JSA and police were still investigating.
“There is almost no doubting that an act of violence was carried out,” Masato Kitamura, chairman of the panel, told a news conference after a council meeting on Monday.
“The general feeling within the council is that a strict disciplinary measure is required,” he added.
A former oyakata was sentenced to five years in prison in 2010 after a court found he had ordered wrestlers to beat 17-year-old trainee Takashi Saito, who had tried to run away, in 2007. Saito died from his injuries.
Mongolian yokozuna Asashoryu, who often found himself at odds with sumo authorities over his behavior, quit the sport that same year after a probe into reports of a drunken scuffle in Tokyo.
Those incidents and increased competition from other sports eroded the popularity of sumo, in which giant wrestlers clad in silk loin-cloths seek to topple, throw or push each other out of a raised ring.
However, January’s promotion of Japanese wrestler Kisenosato to grand champion, the first home-grown yokozuna in 19 years, helped to rebuild the sport’s fan base.
Harumafuji, one of many Mongolian wrestlers to dominate sumo in recent years, started his career in Japan at the age of 16 and was promoted to yokozuna in 2012. He has won nine grand tournaments in all.
Reflecting on his 17-year career in sumo, Harumafuji said: “I really love sumo. The way of sumo is not simply to be strong, but through sumo... I wanted to inspire the people and give them courage and hope.”The assault affair has grabbed headlines since the news broke earlier this month and on Wednesday was the second top news story on public broadcaster NHK, after the launch of a North Korean ballistic missile that splashed down near Japan.
Harumafuji’s retirement leaves three active yokozuna, including fellow Mongolians Hakuho and Kakuryu, with the former winning the most recent grand tournament in Fukuoka to extend his all-time record to 40 titles.


(Reuters) - Former world number one Serena Williams has yet to make a decision about her participation at the Australian Open, while world number 12 Svetlana Kuznetsova is also a doubt for the first grand slam of 2018 after undergoing wrist surgery.
Williams was around two months pregnant when she captured her 23rd grand slam singles title in Melbourne earlier this year and was hoping to defend her crown next January following the birth of her daughter in September.
”Serena is getting ready for 2018,“ the 36-year-old American’s coach Patrick Mouratoglou told CNN. ”She is practicing and getting back in shape. I will be joining her soon in Florida.
“We will see how her body is reacting and how her tennis level is and we will take a decision regarding Australia.”
Russian Kuznetsova told local media that she was recovering from wrist surgery conducted earlier this month after separate injuries to the area and said there was no specific time frame for her return.
“I had two injuries in my wrist, so I had to do the operation,” the 32-year-old double major winner said.
“There’s a very complicated diagnosis. I‘m still recovering and the doctor does not talk about specific dates when I can start training and play. Australia, most likely, I will have to miss.”
Meanwhile, Victoria Azarenka, who has not played since July due to an ongoing child custody battle, is set to return at the ASB Classic in January but will be without coach Michael Joyce, who released a statement on their partnership.
“Vika is an extremely talented player. While I am excited to see her return to tennis, I encourage and respect her decision to put her family first,” Joyce said of the Belarusian two-time Australian Open champion and former world number one.
“It is with deep regret that I have decided to move forward with my coaching career while she continues to work out her private life. I look forward to seeing her on the tour soon and wish her the best of luck.”
The Australian Open will be held from Jan. 15-28.

Memphis Grizzlies star Marc Gasol insists he had nothing to do with the firing of coach David Fizdale, which occurred one day after Gasol was furious that he was benched for the fourth quarter of the team’s eighth consecutive loss.
In fact, Gasol said he was surprised by the timing of the move and didn’t know about the firing until after the decision was made.
Memphis general manager Chris Wallace said the firing of the second-year coach was due to the team being underachievers and not related to the rift between Fizdale and Gasol.
Phoenix Suns center Alex Len admittedly is frustrated with his recent lack of playing time.

South Korean An Byeong-hun will make his return to the team as a captain’s pick along with compatriot Kang Sung-hoon, Hideto Tanihara of Japan and Malaysian Nicholas Fung.
The 12-man team boasts 58 titles won worldwide, with six of the players still in their 20s.
“I‘m proud to announce my team which is predominantly represented by young players,” India’s Atwal said in a statement.
“Seven players in my team are ranked inside the top-100 on the Official World Golf Ranking and this underlines the strength of Team Asia. This is a strong team and it will be our goal to win the EurAsia Cup.”

(Reuters) - Kevin Durant says Colin Kaepernick’s protests during the U.S. national anthem “touched a nerve” in society and sparked a national conversation about issues such as racial equality, the Golden State player told the San Jose Mercury News.
In an interview published on Monday, Durant said he admired the former San Francisco 49ers quarterback for taking the stance, despite the backlash it provoked.
“It definitely put me in a different place because we just started talking about stuff that’s always been going on,” Durant said.
”It was really out of nowhere ... He shocked everybody by doing that.
”You just see he touched something in people that we didn’t know was there,“ Durant said. ”I posted a picture of him on my Instagram, and the comments under that were ridiculous.
“So he kind of touched a nerve and the outrage from it made me a fan of him just because he decided to take all that on ...”
Kaepernick has been unemployed this season despite injuries at other teams that have created job openings. Some experts attribute his political activism as the key reason teams are wary of signing him.
He opted out of his contract with the 49ers in the offseason but has said his agent reached out to all 32 teams to make sure they were aware of his interest in playing this season.
The protests began in 2016 when Kaepernick began sitting and later kneeling during the anthem to call attention to the killing by police of unarmed black men and boys across the United States, as well as racial disparities in the criminal justice system.
Kaepernick inspired many NFL players to kneel in protest during renditions of the national anthem, most notably in September after U.S. President Donald Trump said kneeling players should be fired for disrespecting the country.
Durant, 29, who moved to the NBA champion Warriors last year after eight seasons with the Oklahoma City Thunder, said his focus on basketball had helped insulate him from trouble when he was growing up.
“I kind of grew up in this basketball world, whereas my talent kind of overrides what I look like,” said the 2014 NBA Most Valuable Player.
“I didn’t have it as rough when it comes to that, as far as social or systematic oppression or any social issues. They didn’t really apply to me because I could put a ball in a basket.”


(The Sports Xchange) - Highlights of Monday’s National Basketball Association games:
Kings 110, Warriors 106
Bogdan Bogdanovic hit a driving banker over Draymond Green with 12.6 seconds remaining Monday night to break a tie and lift the Sacramento Kings to a 110-106 victory over the Golden State Warriors.
Golden State, which was playing without Stephen Curry (bruised right hand) and Kevin Durant (sprained left ankle), led 106-102 before the Kings scored the game’s last eight points over the final 3:08.
Sacramento earned its first win in its past nine visits to Oracle Arena and snapped a nine-game road losing streak dating back to the first week of the season.

Rockets 117, Nets 103
James Harden produced another breathlessly efficient scoring performance and Houston rode his hot hand to a victory over Brooklyn.
The Rockets extended their winning streak to five games behind Harden, who scored 37 points on 13-for-20 shooting while adding 10 rebounds and eight assists. He poured in 20 points without a miss in the first quarter as Houston took a 21-point lead it did not relinquish.

New York staged a furious rally in the fourth quarter, cutting Portland’s lead from 26 at the start of the quarter to eight with under a minute left. The Blazers scored just six points in the first 10 minutes of the fourth quarter, but New York went cold and was unable to come any closer.
Spurs 115, Mavericks 108

(The Sports Xchange) - The Ravens executed a fake punt that led to a Javorius “Buck” Allen touchdown, and Alex Collins ran for another score in Baltimore’s 23-16 victory over the Houston Texans on Monday night.
Ravens linebacker Terrell Suggs also came up with huge play, a strip-sack of Texans quarterback Tom Savage late in the fourth quarter. The fumble was recovered by Baltimore defensive tackle Willie Henry.
The Ravens (6-5) have consecutive wins for the first time since the opening two weeks of the season, and they retook the sixth and final AFC playoff spot.
Baltimore overcame a huge performance by Texans receiver DeAndre Hopkins, who caught seven passes for 125 yards.
Baltimore is 12-1 in night games at home since coach John Harbaugh took over the team in 2008. The Ravens have also won 10 consecutive prime-time matchups at M&T Bank Stadium, the longest streak in the NFL.
Houston (4-7) pulled to within 20-16 on a 37-yard field goal by Ka‘imi Fairbairn with 8:36 remaining in the game. The Texans were driving again on their next possession, but Suggs’ strip-sack led to a 49-yard field goal by Justin Tucker that gave Baltimore the 23-16 margin.
Ravens safety Anthony Levine sealed the win with the first interception of his career with just over two minutes left.
Baltimore’s Joe Flacco completed 20 of 32 passes for 141 yards and had a key 25-yard run on the game’s final possession.
The Ravens had three takeaways, giving them an NFL-leading 26.
Savage, filling for the injured Deshaun Watson, was 22 of 37 for 252 yards with two interceptions.
The Ravens’ defense had three penalties for 39 yards on the Texans’ opening drive. That helped set up a four-yard touchdown run by Lamar Miller.
Baltimore got a spark when Sam Koch threw a 22-yard pass to Chris Moore on a fake punt early in the second quarter. Two plays later, Allen tied the game on a 10-yard run.
An interception by safety Tony Jefferson and a 29-yard run by Collins on a fourth-and-1 set up the Ravens’ next score. Collins capped the drive with an 8-yard run, and Baltimore had its first lead, 14-7, with 6:44 left in the half.


(The Sports Xchange) - The Memphis Grizzlies fired coach David Fizdale on Monday and named J.B. Bickerstaff as the interim head coach.
Memphis is mired in an eight-game losing streak and owns a 7-12 mark this season after advancing to the playoffs in 2016-17.
“After a thorough evaluation, I decided a change in course was necessary to move forward and provide the team and organization its best chance at success this season and beyond,” Grizzlies general manager Chris Wallace said.
“Coach Fizdale represented the Grizzlies and City of Memphis proudly, and we wish him well as he continues his career.”
Fizdale has recorded a 50-51 mark since being named the 13th head coach in franchise history on May 29, 2016.
“Coach Fizdale worked tirelessly to achieve on-court success, and for that, we are grateful. We wish him and his family all the best in the future,” Grizzlies controlling owner Robert J. Pera said. “We remain focused on achieving sustainable, long-term success.”
Bickerstaff, who served as Memphis’ associate head coach, posted a 37-34 mark as an interim coach with the Houston Rockets in 2015-16.


(The Sports Xchange) - Highlights of Monday’s National Hockey League games:
Panthers 3, Devils 2
Roberto Luongo etched his name in the record books Monday night as the Florida Panthers defeated the New Jersey Devils 3-2.
Luongo earned his 200th victory as a member of the Panthers, making him just the second goaltender in NHL history to win 200 games for two different teams, joining Hockey Hall of Famer Patrick Roy. Luongo also won 252 games with the Vancouver Canucks, while Roy earned 289 victories with the Montreal Canadiens and 262 with the Colorado Avalanche.
Luongo, 38, made 23 saves in his milestone victory. His counterpart, Cory Schneider of the Devils, stopped the first 29 shots he faced and finished with 35 saves in the loss.
The Panthers scored the decisive goal at 12:45 of the third period. Jared McCann collected the rebound of his own blocked shot and flipped his fourth goal past Schneider to give Florida a 3-2 lead.
Canadiens 3, Blue Jackets 1
Montreal ended Columbus’ six-game winning streak as Carey Price made 37 saves in his second game back from injury.
Brendan Gallagher, Jonathan Drouin and Andrew Shaw scored as the Canadiens won consecutive games. Price had a 36-save shutout Saturday in a 3-0 win against the Buffalo Sabres after missing 10 games with a lower-body injury.
Sergei Bobrovsky, who had won the six previous games, made 25 saves for Columbus. Rookie center Pierre-Luc Dubois scored for the Blue Jackets.
Penguins 5, Flyers 4 (OT)
Sidney Crosby scored at 1:48 of overtime to give Pittsburgh a win over reeling Philadelphia, but the Penguins lost No. 1 goaltender Matt Murray to an apparent leg injury in the second period.
There was no immediate word on Murray’s status. Philadelphia has lost eight in a row (0-3-5), its longest losing streak since it lost 10 straight in February 2008.
On the winner, Crosby chipped in a shot by Kris Letang. Pittsburgh won its second in a row. The Penguins tied it 3-3 with goals in the first two minutes of the third period on goals by Patric Hornqvist and Bryan Rust. After Michael Raffl scored for the Flyers, Jake Guentzel forced overtime with his second goal when he tied it at 4-4 with 1:04 left in regulation.
Jets 7, Wild 2
Winnipeg shook off any hangover it had from being shut out for the first time this season, routing goalie Alex Stalock and Minnesota.
The Jets scored seven consecutive goals, with Bryan Little, Joel Armia, Kyle Connor, Mark Scheifele, Mathieu Perreault, Blake Wheeler and Jacob Trouba connecting after Jason Zucker and Chris Stewart staked the visitors to a 2-0 lead.
Connor Hellebuyck stopped 17 shots for his 13th win of the season while Stalock blocked 21 shots in the loss. The Jets lost 4-0 to San Jose on Saturday to finish off a four-game road trip.
Blackhawks 7, Ducks 3
Rookie right winger Alex DeBrincat scored his first career hat trick and notched an assist as part of a four-point performance, and Chicago pulled away from Anaheim.
Patrick Sharp, Brandon Saad, Artem Anisimov and Nick Schmaltz also scored as the Blackhawks tallied their second-most goals of the season. Chicago extended its point streak to five games.


(The Sports Xchange) - Colorado Avalanche captain Gabriel Landeskog has been suspended four games by the NHL for cross-checking Calgary Flames forward Matthew Tkachuk, the league announced Monday.
Landeskog lowered the boom on Tkachuk with 4:42 remaining in the first period of Saturday’s 3-2 loss to the Flames. The 25-year-old Swedish forward was assessed a minor penalty on the play.
The suspension is the second in the career of Landeskog, who received a three-game ban in March 2016 for a cross-check on then-Anaheim Ducks defenseman Simon Depres.
Landeskog has collected nine goals and eight assists in 22 games this season for the Avalanche (11-9-2), who have dropped two in a row and six of their last nine (3-4-2).
The Winnipeg Jets recalled goaltender Eric Comrie from the Manitoba Moose of the American Hockey League.
The Edmonton, Alberta, native made his NHL debut on April 6 at Columbus and had 35 saves to earn the win.
The Jets also reassigned goaltender Jamie Phillips to Manitoba from the East Coast Hockey League’s Jacksonville Icemen.
The Minnesota Wild recalled former first-round defenseman Ryan Murphy from Iowa of the American Hockey League, the team announced.
Murphy was signed as a free agent by Minnesota on July 1.
The 24-year-old Ontario native notched a pair of assists in 27 contests last season with the Carolina Hurricanes.
The Florida Panthers recalled forward Denis Malgin from the Springfield Thunderbirds of the American Hockey League.
Malgin, 20, has played in 52 career NHL games, all with Florida, recording six goals and four assists. He has skated in five games this season for the Panthers, averaging 9:33 time on ice with no points.
Malgin, a native of Olten, Switzerland, was originally selected by Florida in the fourth round of the 2015 NHL draft.
The Boston Bruins assigned forward Jordan Szwarz to Providence of the American Hockey League.


(The Sports Xchange) - The Denver Broncos’ quarterback carousel once again will turn to Trevor Siemian after coach Vance Joseph announced Monday that Paxton Lynch will be sidelined two to four weeks with a high ankle injury.
Lynch sustained the non-contact injury during the third quarter of Sunday’s 21-14 loss to the Raiders on Sunday at the Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum. The 2016 first-round pick completed 9 of 14 passes for 41 yards with one interception while making his first start of the season and third career.
The New England Patriots placed tight end Martellus Bennett on injured reserve.
The move comes one day after Bennett was inactive in the Patriots’ 35-17 win over the Miami Dolphins due to shoulder and hamstring injuries. New England also put defensive back Nate Ebner on injured reserve.
Buffalo Bills wide receiver Kelvin Benjamin has a torn meniscus in his right knee, the team announced.
Benjamin, who was acquired from the Carolina Panthers on Oct. 31, sustained the injury during Buffalo’s 54-24 loss to the Los Angeles Chargers on Nov. 19.
Detroit Lions safety Tavon Wilson was placed on injured reserve with an ailing shoulder, the team announced.
Wilson aggravated the injury during Detroit’s 30-23 loss to the Minnesota Vikings on Thanksgiving Day.
Carolina Panthers tight end Greg Olsen, who made his long-awaited return to the lineup on Sunday after an eight-week absence due to a broken foot, received positive news after seeing a specialist.
Olsen was examined orthopedic specialist Dr. Robert Anderson and his foot was judged to be “OK,” the Charlotte Observer reported, citing a source.
Denver Broncos cornerback Aqib Talib opened up about his role in a fight with Oakland Raiders wide receiver Michael Crabtree that saw both players ejected from Sunday’s game at Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum.


BERLIN (Reuters) - Five more Russian competitors from the 2014 Sochi Olympics were banned for life over anti-doping rule violations on Monday with the International Olympic Committee saying Russia’s former anti-doping chief-turned-whistleblower was telling the truth.
The banned athletes include Dmitrii Trunenkov and Aleksei Negodailo, both in the gold-medal winning four-man bobsleigh team, plus biathlon relay silver medalists Yana Romanova and Olga Vilukhina, who also won silver in the 7.5 km event.
The latest bans bring the total number of Russian athletes suspended from the Games for life to 19 this month, with the IOC annulling results following widespread doping and tampering with samples of Russian athletes during the Sochi Games.
The IOC also published its reasoning behind the lifetime ban of the first Russian to be sanctioned as part of its investigation, cross country gold medalist Alexander Legkov.
The IOC said it was proven that Legkov was part of a scheme to tamper with the samples of Russians at Sochi.
The Olympic body is re-testing all Russian athletes’ samples from those Games following revelations by Grigory Rodchenkov, the former head of Moscow’s discredited anti-doping laboratory, of a scheme to cover up home competitors’ positive samples.
The IOC launched two investigations following Rodchenkov’s claims with one focusing on the Sochi Games re-tests and the other looking at allegations of systematic state-backed doping.
The IOC on Monday said that in Legkov’s case, evidence provided by Rodchenkov, now living in the United States, was used and deemed credible.
“The (IOC) Disciplinary Commission has come to the conclusion that, whatever his motivation may be and whichever wrongdoing he may have committed in the past, Dr Rodchenkov was telling the truth when he provided explanations of the cover-up scheme that he managed,” it said in its decision.
“The Disciplinary Commission would have preferred... to be able to hear Dr Rodchenkov in person. However, this does not alter its conviction that Dr Rodchenkov is a truthful witness and that his statements reflect the reality and can be used as valid evidence.”
The Sochi scandal, triggered by revelations made by Rodchenkov, is part of a broader doping affair that has led to the suspension of Russia’s anti-doping agency RUSADA, its athletics federation and Paralympic Committee.
The IOC has said it will decide during its executive board meeting next month on the participation of Russian competitors at the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics in South Korea in February.


BERLIN (Reuters) - Russia have been knocked off the medals top spot for the 2014 Sochi winter Olympics after five more athletes received lifetime Games bans on Monday over doping violations at those Olympics, but the final medal count could be months or even years away.
This month a total of 19 Russians have been banned from the Games for life as a result of an International Olympic Committee (IOC) investigation into allegations of widespread doping among Russian competitors and sample tampering by laboratory and security officials at the Sochi Games.
Gold medal-winning bobsledders Dmitrii Trunenkov and Aleksei Negodailo, members of the winning four-man team, as well as biathlon relay silver medalists Yana Romanova and Olga Vilukhina, who also won silver in the 7.5 km event, were the latest to be sanctioned by the IOC on Monday.
Russia, a winter sports powerhouse, were top of the medals table at the end of the Games on home soil in 2014 but the latest IOC decision now brings their number of gold medals at events down to eight.
Those already banned include double gold medalist bobsledder Alexander Zubkov, Olympic skeleton champion Alexander Tretyakov as well as six cross-country skiers.
While the IOC has ordered the return of the medals, Russian sports officials have pledged to appeal the bans and take their case to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS).
It is unlikely that Russians will get any medals back with the IOC saying on Monday that the doping samples had been clearly tampered with, in its published reasoning on the first athlete to have been banned in this process.
But they can be hopeful of potentially overturning the lifetime Olympic bans, with CAS having thrown out previous attempts to ban past drugs cheats from future Olympics.
The IOC and the British Olympic Association had tried to pass such Olympic bans ahead of the 2012 London Games but both efforts were thwarted by CAS.
It will no doubt further delay the process and can ultimately lead to medals being reallocated years later as is often the case.
The IOC told Reuters that with each case being different and involving several international sports federations as well as appeals, giving a specific date by when all Sochi Games medals will have been decided was not possible at this stage.
Australian race walker Jared Tallent received his London 2012 Olympics 50-km gold medal in 2016 after Russian winner Sergey Kirdyapkin was stripped of his medal for doping.
But it could also be the case that the IOC decides not to reallocate some medals, as they did with disgraced U.S. sprinter Mario Jones’s 100m gold medal from the 2000 Sydney Olympics.
In 2007 the IOC stripped all five of Jones’ Sydney Games track and field medals but refused to reallocate her 100m sprint gold to silver medalist Katerina Thanou of Greece, who was herself disqualified for doping offences at the 2004 Games.


(The Sports Xchange) - Highlights of Sunday’s National Hockey League games:
Rangers 4, Canucks 3 (shootout)
Jimmy Vesey scored the deciding goal in the seventh round of the shootout as the New York Rangers defeated the Vancouver Canucks 4-3 on Sunday afternoon.
Brock Boeser and Sven Baertschi of the Canucks and Kevin Shattenkirk and Rick Nash of the Rangers also scored during the shootout.
The Rangers have won four in a row and eight straight games at home.
Loui Eriksson, Jake Virtanen and Sam Gagner scored in regulation for the Canucks, who received 17 saves from Jacob Markstrom. New York’s regulation goals came from Jesper Fast, Michael Grabner and Vesey.
Hurricanes 4, Predators 3 (SO)
Carolina was perfect in the shootout, with Sebastian Aho and Teuvo Teravainen converting to defeat Nashville.
Craig Smith had tied the game for Nashville with 8:45 remaining in the third period.
Carolina’s Justin Williams scored on a third-period power play to put the Hurricanes ahead with 14:11 left. Carolina also got goals from Josh Jooris and Victor Rask, while Viktor Arvidsson and Mattias Ekholm scored for Nashville.
Oilers 4, Bruins 2
Ryan Strome scored the tiebreaking goal early in the third period, and Edmonton beat Boston.
Strome took a pass from Leon Draisaitl in the high slot 2:07 into the third and fired it past Boston goaltender Tuukka Rask for a 3-2 lead. The Oilers took their sixth straight victory over the Bruins, a streak that stretches back to Nov. 6, 2014.


(Reuters) - Olympic hopeful Satoko Miyahara clinched an emphatic victory in the ladies’ competition at Skate America on Sunday ahead of Japanese compatriot Kaori Sakamoto.
Miyahara, who missed part of last season due to a hip injury, built on her lead from Saturday’s short program with a near flawless performance in the free skate in Lake Placid, New York.
She secured a season-best 143.31 points to finish with 214.03, ahead of Sakamoto on 210.59. American Bradie Tennell was third on 204.10 in her senior Grand Prix debut.
Miyahara’s victory, however, was not enough to clinch a place in the Grand Prix final in her home country in two weeks’ time. She will be first substitute for the Nagoya competition.
“I am very happy and satisfied with today’s performance and to get my best scores,” said the 19-year-old, who completed seven clean triples skating to ‘Madame Butterfly’.
The 2015 world silver medalist missed the world championships earlier this year due to a stress fracture in her left hip.
“After the injury, this is the first big step. The most important event, the Japanese nationals, are coming next month,” said Miyahara, who faces a big challenge to make the Japanese team for February’s Pyeongchang Winter Olympics.
Sakamoto was also satisfied with her personal best in the free skate but said she can get even better.
“In the short program I did a mistake on the spin and I have so much room to improve my performance -- the jumps, the spins and the grade of execution,” she said.
In the ice dancing competition, American siblings Maia and Alex Shibutani took the title after accruing 194.25 points.
“This was the competition we wanted to have before the Grand Prix Final,” Maia said.


(The Sports Xchange) - Highlights of Sunday’s NBA games:
Heat 100, Bulls 93
Goran Dragic scored 24 points, including 14 in the fourth quarter, and Wayne Ellington finished with 19 points as Miami defeated Chicago.
Miami won its third straight game as James Johnson finished with 15 points to go along with 11 points and 10 rebounds from Hassan Whiteside and 10 points off the bench from Kelly Olynyk. Tyler Johnson rounded out Miami’s balanced scoring attack with 10 points.
The Bulls, who have lost five straight, were led by Jerian Grant, who scored 24 points. Denzel Valentine scored 14 points and had 13 rebounds for Chicago, which also got 15 points from Justin Holiday and 11 apiece from rookie Lauri Markkanen and Bobby Portis.
Timberwolves 119, Suns 108
Karl-Anthony Towns had 32 points and 12 rebounds, and Jimmy Butler chipped in with 25 points as the Minnesota Timberwolves held on for a 119-108 win against the Phoenix Suns on Sunday.
Towns recorded his league-leading 16th double-double, and Andrew Wiggins scored 21 points with a season-high four 3-pointers for Minnesota, which survived another strong shooting night from an opponent. Phoenix shot 50.6 percent from the field and was 13 of 26 from 3-point range despite playing without leading scorer Devin Booker.
Taj Gibson had 16 points and a season-high 14 rebounds for the Timberwolves, who had lost three of their previous four games. Minnesota is off to its best start since 2005-06 when it also started 12-8.
Nets 98, Grizzlies 88
DeMarre Carroll scored 24 points and Trevor Booker had 16 points and 11 rebounds as Brooklyn beat Memphis.
Marc Gasol and Tyreke Evans had 18 points each to pace the Grizzlies. Gasol scored only two points in the second half.


(Reuters) - Over half of the 377 weightlifters at the world championships that begin on Tuesday in the United States will be drug tested as the sport begins a new chapter to try to retain its Olympic status after decisions taken by the governing IWF.
By the time of the last lift on Dec. 5 at the worlds in Anaheim, California, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) will have begun deliberations on whether weightlifting should feature at the Paris 2024 Games.
“We accept that in the past the incidence of doping in weightlifting has been too high,” says Hungarian Tamas Ajan, president of the International Weightlifting Federation (IWF) since 2000 and secretary general for 24 years before that.
Ajan, 78, was speaking in Anaheim at the weekend, where the IWF adopted a hardline approach to doping at an executive board meeting. It will target “less than a dozen high-risk countries where there is an entrenched culture of doping that goes beyond weightlifting”. The countries involved were not named.
Of the 49 weightlifting positives in the re-testing of samples from the 2008 and 2012 Olympics – more than any other sport - 43 were from nations formerly part of the Soviet Union.
Russia was banned from the Rio 2016 Games for repeated offences that “brought weightlifting into disrepute” and is also among the nine nations excluded from the world championships for having three or more of those 49 positives.
Russian Weightlifting Federation president Maxim Agapitov said at the European Junior Championships in Albania on Oct 22:
“We are building a new future, but I accept we have to take responsibility for so many positives in the past. It is in the past but it so happens that we must answer for it.”
China is also banned from the world championships in Anaheim and, like Russia, has been accused of state-sponsored doping.
When the IFW said it was imposing a one-year ban on Chinese lifters from mid-October, the Chinese Weightlifting Association (CWA) issued a statement expressing “regret” at the decision.
“China has been firmly against doping and has a zero-tolerance approach to this particular problem,” Xinhua reported the CWA as saying in a statement on Oct. 1.
Doping allegations against China and Russia are under investigation by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).
However, Russia, like the Chinese, has always denied any involvement in state-sponsored doping.
Under new rules approved by the IWF on Saturday, countries will face bans of up to four years “if they do not fulfill their anti-doping responsibilities”, which would keep them out of the Olympics.
A new Olympic qualifying system will also require athletes to compete more often than some do now.
Kazakh Ilya Ilyin, stripped of his gold medals from Beijing and London after testing positive, was absent from international competition for more than two years between those two Games.
There will be more out-of-competition testing, and a more detailed record of athletes’ coaching and support personnel.
The IWF’s anti-doping program will be handed over to an Independent Testing Authority.
“Today marks the start of a new chapter for international weightlifting,” said Ajan. “The Olympic Movement can trust that we are doing, and will continue to do, everything in our power to address the incidence of doping in our sport.”
A Clean Sport Commission set up by the IWF, including two German scientists, an American lawyer, and the president of the German Weightlifting Federation among its seven members, made the recommendations adopted this weekend, and will monitor progress over the next four years.
In June the IOC asked for an IWF report by December on how the governing body plans to deal with doping. Unless it is deemed “satisfactory” at an IOC meeting in Lausanne on Dec. 5-6, weightlifting will lose its Olympic status after Tokyo 2020.
Because of the bans, and North Korea’s decision not to enter, 13 of 15 current world champions will not compete in Anaheim, leaving Tunisia, Mongolia and New Zealand, who have no pedigree in the sport at this level, to contend for medals.
The U.S. hope to win their first men’s world championships medals in 20 years. The host nation’s best chance of success is in the 69kg category with teenager Clarence ‘CJ’ Cummings, who has won four world titles at youth and junior level.


(Reuters) - Kjetil Jansrud won the first Super-G of the season at Lake Louise on Sunday, besting a duo of Austrians and his Norwegian team mates for his 10th World Cup title in the event.
The favorite going into Sunday’s competition, the twice Super-G season winner was flawless during his one minute 30.76 second trip down the course in Western Canada.
“Winning the race proves that you are on the right track, so I‘m very happy with my win today in Lake Louise,” he said of the first of six Super-Gs of the Olympic season.
Sunday’s race comes with just 74 days remaining before the opening ceremony of Pyeongchang Winter Olympics.
Two Austrians, Max Franz (1:31.04) and 37-year-old Hannes Reichelt (1:31.08), the oldest racing in Sunday’s field, finished second and third.
Aleksander Aamodt Kilde (1:31.17) and Aksel Lund Svindal (1:31.28), two Norwegians who along with Jansrud are known as the “Attacking Vikings,” finished fourth and fifth.
The 32-year-old Jansrud was among the first to race on Sunday and benefited from clear conditions that were not enjoyed by many of his competitors.
Heavy snow fell as the day progressed, slowing the course down and impacting visibility.
Jansrud had finished fifth in the downhill event on Saturday and the winner of that race, Swiss Beat Feuz, finished 12th in the Super-G on Sunday.
A scary moment occurred when Briton Jack Gower crashed at full speed into the course’s net fencing, losing a ski and tumbling awkwardly.
He waved his hand to the crowd to indicate he was okay and was able to ski to the end of the course under his own strength after the race was temporarily suspended.
The sport is still mourning the death of French skier David Poisson in a training accident in Alberta on Nov. 13.
The next stop for the men is Beaver Creek, where there will be Super-G, downhill and giant slalom events on Dec. 1-3.


(Reuters) - American Mikaela Shiffrin beat rival Petra Vlhova of Slovakia to claim the World Cup title in the women’s slalom for the second year in a row at the Killington Cup in Vermont on Sunday.
Shiffrin built a commanding 0.89 of a second lead with an aggressive first run and avoided mistakes in her solid second trip down the icy course in windy conditions.
She finished with a combined time for the two runs of 1 minute 40.91 seconds, 1.64 seconds better than Vlhova.
“I just tried to stay as balanced as I could,” Shiffrin said of her second run.
”I wanted to really attack the second run but I also knew I had to be smart in some sections and it worked out quite well.
“It wasn’t easy but when I ski balanced, it makes it easier than when I don‘t.”
The win marks the 22-year-old Shiffrin’s first World Cup crown of the year and her 26th career title in slalom.
Shiffrin will look to be the first skier to win back-to-back gold medals in slalom when she competes at the Winter Olympic Games in Pyeongchang, South Korea in February.
Sunday’s win was payback for Shiffrin, who has lost to fellow 22-year-old Vlhova in the last two World Cup slalom competitions.
The speedy Vlhova has emerged as the American’s chief rival in the sport.
Austrian Bernadette Schild finished a distant third, 2.67 second back of Shiffrin.
The Colorado-born Shiffrin, who spent her formative years in New Hampshire and Vermont, credited the vocal support of the record crowd of 18,000 for her win.
“Today I felt they really carried me to the finish,” she said. “The fans on the East Coast are the best crowd that I race in front of.”


ABU DHABI (Reuters) - Valtteri Bottas won the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix on Sunday as Mercedes wrapped up another triumphant Formula One season with a one-two finish and four-times world champion Lewis Hamilton having to settle for second.
The win was a career third for the Finn, who had started on pole position and stayed in front to deny Hamilton a 10th success of the 20-race campaign.
"It's a really important win for me after having a pretty difficult starhere:reuters.com,2017:newsml_RC1A871CE5E0:1882414687/tag:reuters.com,2017:binary_RC1A871CE5E0-BASEIMAGE?action=download&mediatype=picture&mex_media_type=picture&token=%22eRteDxUrGvnKAtm9NwB9oTbL%2BE8%2Fe0J3yfbfQ%2BHdRaQ%3D%22t to the second half of the year," said Bottas, who joined Mercedes after 2016 champion Nico Rosberg retired abruptly a year ago.
“This weekend, pole and win, I couldn’t be happier to end the season like this.”
In a processional race, with plenty of glamour but little excitement under the Yas Marina floodlights, Ferrari’s Sebastian Vettel took third place to finish runner-up in a championship that Hamilton won in Mexico last month.
The final points tally was Hamilton 363, Vettel 317 and Bottas 305.
Mercedes had already won the constructors’ world championship for the fourth year in a row and ended with 668 points to Ferrari’s 522. The one-two finish was their fourth of the season.
Bottas managed the pace throughout, ceding the lead to Hamilton only when he pitted first, with no major issues.
He took the chequered flag 3.8 seconds clear of his team mate, who had been within a second at one point. Vettel was 19 seconds down the road.
”After three, four or five laps I couldn’t go any faster and from then it was pretty lonely,“ said Vettel, a three-times winner in Abu Dhabi. ”In the second part of the race we had a stronger pace but not good enough.
“Very much congratulations to Lewis on his season, he deserves to win the championship this year in the end. I hate to say it, but he was the better man. I‘m sure we will do our bit over the winter and hopefully come back stronger.”
Hamilton kept Bottas in his sights but was unable to do anything but follow. He said that was not because of any lack of intent.
“Big congratulations to Valtteri, he did an amazing job today to hold me off. It was a great race, I gave it everything, every single lap. It is hard to overtake here,” said the Briton after his 25th successive race in the points.
“It’s so hard to follow,” he said in the cool-down room before going on the podium. “I was, like, ‘Where are all the backmarkers?'. I think they need to change this track.”
The pair performed celebratory tyre-burning spins after the finish, with retiring Brazilian Felipe Massa pulling his Williams alongside the Mercedes and joining in the hugs and handshakes.
With the finishing order reflecting the starting positions, with the exception of Red Bull’s Australian Daniel Ricciardo who retired with an hydraulics issue, the main suspense was in midfield.
Toro Rosso, Renault and Haas were separated by just six points before the start, with millions of dollars in prize money at stake and Renault taking the honours thanks to Nico Hulkenberg’s sixth place.
It was still a tense evening for the French manufacturer team, however, after their Spanish driver Carlos Sainz was released from a pitstop with a loose wheel and retired after almost crashing in the exit tunnel.
Hulkenberg was also given a five-second penalty for cutting a corner, with some considering that the stewards had let the German off lightly rather than forcing him to hand back the place to Force India’s Sergio Perez.
There was also an emotional send-off for Brazilian veteran  Massa, the 2008 world championship runner-up finishing 10th in his final race.
“I am very lucky to have all of this in my life so ready for the next step,” said the former Ferrari driver. “For sure, I will miss many things -- racing against amazing drivers and competing in the best car and the best category in the world.”
McLaren’s Honda partnership ended in the points with Fernando Alonso finishing ninth.
The old Formula One logo also made a final appearance, the sport’s new owners presenting a new one as part of a bigger rebranding to come.


ABU DHABI (Reuters) - Lewis Hamilton ended the Formula One season on the podium on Sunday but recognized that winning his fourth world championship with two races to spare had affected his performances.
As in 2015, when he secured the title in Texas and then-team mate Nico Rosberg claimed the final three races of the season, Hamilton has not won since the U.S. Grand Prix.
He was ninth in Mexico, where he clinched the title, then fourth in Brazil two weeks ago and second in Abu Dhabi on Sunday behind Mercedes team mate Valtteri Bottas.
Last year, with the battle going down to the wire, he won the last four races but still lost out to Rosberg -- who retired soon after.
“I still drove relatively well but, yeah, I wouldn’t say it was 100 percent like it was whilst in the season,” the Briton told reporters after ending the campaign with nine wins from 20 races.
”All I can say is that in the week after I won the championship I partied a lot. That’s what you do. I didn’t do that before the other races.
“The energy has not been the same, even if I have approached the races the same. But I‘m not worried about that. Next year it will go back to what it was in the second half of the season,” he added.
Hamilton won two of his titles -- in 2008 and 2014 -- in the final race of the season.
Leaving them aside, he has yet to win a race (in the same season) after winning the championship -- a problem that did not affect to the same extent other multiple champions such as Michael Schumacher.
Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff said he was not at all concerned.
“These guys are pushing the cars to the limit. He didn’t put a foot wrong all season. I’d rather it happened after the championship than before,” said the Austrian.
Wolff said both Mercedes drivers had raced for the win on Sunday, rejecting scepticism about whether the pair were truly fighting for position once Bottas led away from pole position.
”They were almost full blast,“ he said. ”We gave them the power in order to fight it out on track.
“It’s very difficult with these cars to overtake in Abu Dhabi.”


ABU DHABI (Reuters) - Felipe Massa bowed out of Formula One in Abu Dhabi on Sunday with his head held high and one last point in a career that brought him 11 wins and almost a world championship with Ferrari.
The 36-year-old Brazilian said he was ready for the next step, whatever that might be.
“For sure, I will miss many things -- racing against amazing drivers and competing in the best car and the best category in the world,” he said after finishing 10th for Williams under the Yas Marina floodlights.
The farewell was one of several for Massa, who also retired last year before being brought back hurriedly by Williams in January as a replacement for Valtteri Bottas when the Finn went to Mercedes.
He had also said goodbye to his home fans in Brazil two weeks ago.
But there was still plenty of emotion as the sport saluted a man who lost out to Lewis Hamilton in the 2008 championship by a single point and then endured life-threatening head injuries in Hungary in 2009 when hit by a bouncing spring in qualifying.
“You wouldn’t meet a more universally-liked driver, I think,” said long-time friend and colleague Rob Smedley, now head of performance engineering at Williams after a stint at Ferrari as the Brazilian’s race engineer.
“It will be weird coming to a grand prix and not having him there,” he told Sky Sports television.
“We’re mates so we’ll see lots of each other. That won’t change. He’ll carry on racing because it’s in his blood. I think this is now definitely, undoubtedly, the right time to retire from Formula One.”
Massa ends the season 11th overall, with 43 points compared to his teenage rookie Canadian team mate Lance Stroll on 40.
But while the bulk of Stroll’s points came from a third place finish in Azerbaijan and sixth in Mexico, Massa has been a more consistent scorer with 13 top 10 finishes in 20 races compared to the Canadian’s seven.
“He’s been unlucky, he hasn’t got all the points he should have done, he should have won in Azerbaijan,” said Smedley.
“But weekend in and weekend out we rely on him and to have a driver like that who is loved by the team, loved by the paddock and is still performing at the top of his game, there’s no better way to go out.”


LILLE, France (Reuters) - France won their 10th Davis Cup title when Lucas Pouille crushed Steve Darcis 6-3 6-1 6-0 to give the hosts a 3-2 victory in the final against neighbours Belgium on Sunday.
Pouille was never threatened in the decisive rubber after David Goffin had given Belgium both their points with impressive displays in the singles.
Les Bleus, however, had more strength in depth, winning a singles match through Jo-Wilfried Tsonga on Friday and Saturday’s doubles with Richard Gasquet and Pierre-Hugues Herbert.
It was their first title since they beat Australia away in 2001 before three defeats in the final - in 2002, 2010 and 2014 - while Belgium have yet to win the title, having now lost three finals after defeats in 1904 and 2015.
Yannick Noah, the last Frenchman to win a grand slam title, celebrated his third Davis Cup success as captain after leading France to victory in 1991 and 1996.
“It was a victory we had been dreaming off,” said Noah.     “It’s a united group. It was a tough weekend against a good Belgian team. Lucas played a fantastic final match.”
Belgium captain Johan Van Herck added: “I would not change anything. We have regrets about losing, it’s normal that we are disappointed after a tough weekend. In sports it’s never nice to be second”.
Goffin gave the visitors a 1-0 lead by beating Pouille in the opening singles before Tsonga levelled by defeating Darcis on Friday, the number ones both prevailing in straight sets.
France took the lead thanks to the pairing of Gasquet and Herbert, who had never played a competitive match together but beat Ruben Bemelmans and Joris De Loore in four sets.
Goffin was again a notch above the rest on Sunday, levelling the tie at 2-2 against Tsonga with a 7-6(5) 6-3 6-2 win as the world number seven sent the tie into a decider.
The final match was anti-climactic as Pouille went for the throat, racing to a 3-0 lead against Darcis, who never seemed to stand a chance on the indoor hardcourt even if he had won all of his five matches in the competition before.
World number 18 Pouille, who was born 75 km from Lille, held serve to take the first set and never looked back, claiming 12 games in a row and closing it out on the first match point when a sorry Darcis sent a shot long.
“There’s nothing more beautiful than winning as a team in front of my friends and family. Now we’re going to celebrate and enjoy it,” said Pouille.


(Reuters) - American Nathan Chen overcame his worst free skate in more than a year to win gold at Skate America in Lake Placid, New York on Saturday.
Chen, the final skater of the night, fell during one jump and had to put his hand on the ice to prevent another tumble during a routine that earned him a disappointing score of 171.76, which was still the second highest of the free skate.
But thanks to the 18-year-old’s 15-plus-point lead after Friday’s short program, Chen commanded the top spot with a total score of 275.88, locking up a place in his second straight Grand Prix Final in Japan next month.
“Very disappointed with today,” Chen told reporters.
“I came in here with a lot more expectations in terms of what I was going to do. I exerted too much energy (early) and then it took me a little bit to recalculate. I didn’t recalculate properly and so the rest of the program went downhill from there.”
American team mate Adam Rippon won the free skate with a score of 177.41 despite dislocating his shoulder on his first jump due to a fall. Rippon grabbed silver overall with a score of 266.45.
“For American skating, I think it says a lot,” Rippon said. “It says that in the most important year, an Olympic year, that we’re here and we’re here to challenge for medals in the individual event and we’re here to challenge for the gold medal in the team event.”
Russia’s Sergei Voronov was third at 257.49 followed by China’s Jin Boyang and Yan Han. Ross Miner of the U.S. was sixth.
On the women’s side, Japan’s Satoko Miyahara finished atop the short program at 70.72.
Miyahara thrived to put a hip injury behind her that had kept her out of competitions this year.
Japan’s Kaori Sakamoto was second (69.40) followed by Canada’s Gabrielle Daleman (68.08) and Bradie Tennell (67.01) of the U.S.
In the pairs competition, Aljona Savchenko and Bruno Massot of Germany came from third to snatch gold with a winning score of 223.13 after a strong showing in the free skate.
China’s Yu Xiaoyu and Zhang Hao stayed in second with a total of 219.20 while Canadian double world champions Meagan Duhamel and Eric Radford lost their lead after Friday’s short program and ended up third.


(Reuters) - Reigning World Cup champion Beat Feuz again set the pace by winning the season-opening men’s downhill at Lake Louise on Saturday as the sport continued to mourn death of French skier David Poisson.
The 30-year-old Swiss sped down the course in a time of one minute 43.76 seconds to edge Austria’s Matthias Mayer (1.43.85)  by less than a tenth of a second.
The day, however, belonged to the memory of Poisson, who died Nov. 13 in a training accident in Alberta. Skiers wore heart-shaped stickers with his initials on their helmets and race bibs that bore his name.
It was particularly meaningful for the French racers, who competed with Poisson’s name emblazoned across their chests. Adrien Theaux posted the French team’s best result in seventh place.
But Feuz, who in February beat Canada’s Erik Guay for the World Cup gold in St. Moritz, once again set the standard.
“Beginning the season with a win is the best thing that can happen,” Feuz said. “I had a great summer preparation, without any injuries and am very happy about how things turned out here, especially as I’m not performing very well here usually.”
Norway’s Aksel Lund Svindal took third despite struggling with a knee that ended his last season prematurely.
“(The knee) is not awesome, but racing is racing,” the 34-year-old said. “You don’t get old in sports, it’s more about injuries you have. In the end, there’s just too much stuff that’s not working the way it should.”
Italy’s Peter Fill finished fourth (1:44.28) followed by another Norwegian Kjetil Jansrud (1:44.39).
The race schedule at Lake Louise will continue on Sunday with the Super-G competition.


ABU DHABI (Reuters) - British teenage gamer Brendon Leigh became Formula One’s first eSports champion after winning the finale in Abu Dhabi on Saturday.
The 18-year-old kitchen manager from Reading, who had never before left Britain or attended a Formula One race, collected a total of 74 points to come out on top of the 20 finalists competing at the finals inside the F1 paddock.
More than 63,000 hopefuls worldwide had entered the competition back in September by competing on PlayStation4, Xbox One and Windows PC platforms.
The rewards for the winner, apart from taking away the inaugural trophy, included the right to be a non-driver character in the official F1 2018 game and automatic qualification for next year’s semi-final.
“Winning here means a huge amount to me. I am the first one to do it. That is special,” Leigh said after finishing six points ahead of Chilean Fabrizio Donoso Delgado after three races - Montreal, Spa and Yas Marina.
“I am not sure how to celebrate. I don’t drink or anything: I think I might just go to bed,” added the teenager, who swept past Delgado on the final lap of the virtual Abu Dhabi circuit to win the title.
The top three gamers will have an official prize giving ceremony on the grand prix podium after Sunday’s real season-ending race.
“The attraction to a broad and committed younger generation of F1 and Esport fans is something that we are proud to support and nurture,” said Formula One’s commercial manager Sean Bratches in a statement.
“We look forward to establishing a season-long series in 2018.”
The eSports Series is a partnership with Formula One, game developer Codemasters and events and competitions specialists Gfinity.
U.S.-based Liberty Media, who took over Formula One in January and have targeted gaming as a growth area to drive revenues and connect with younger audiences, are also due to reveal a new logo and branding for the sport on Sunday.
Some of Formula One’s participants are already embracing the world of eSports, with McLaren executive director Zak Brown saying all teams could eventually have their own virtual counterpart.
McLaren recently appointed a gamer as an official simulator driver and twice world champion Fernando Alonso has launched his own eSport team.


(Reuters) - Germany’s Viktoria Rebensburg won her second World Cup race of the season on Saturday when she beat American favorite Mikaela Shiffrin in the giant slalom in Killington, Vermont.
Rebensburg, the 2010 Olympic champion in the giant slalom, expanded the lead she had established on her opening run on the Superstar trail, clocking a combined two-run time of 1 minute 57.63 seconds.
It gave her a convincing win by 0.67 seconds over Shiffrin, who had put herself in striking position of a victory following her first run. Italy’s Manuela Moelgg (1:59.12) finished third.
The win for Rebensburg came four weeks after she won the giant slalom in the first race of the World Cup season in Soelden, Austria.
Rebensburg finished the first run in 58.39 seconds, with Shiffrin 0.26 back and Molgg third, 0.58 behind the leader.
The World Cup event at Killington finishes on Sunday with the slalom, Shiffrin’s specialty as the defending champion.
The day began with a moment of silence for David Poisson, the French skier who died following a crash during training at the Canadian resort of Nakiska on Nov. 13.


LILLE, France (Reuters) - France captain Yannick Noah gambled on an untested pair for the  pivotal Davis Cup final doubles against Belgium on Saturday but  Richard Gasquet and Pierre-Hugues Herbert’s win ensured he was spared a “hot seat” as Les Bleus moved into the driving seat.
Despite a big scare in the third set, Noah’s chosen duo beat Ruben Bemelmans and Joris De Loore 6-1 3-6 7-6(2) 6-4 as France moved 2-1 ahead and within one win of a 10th Davis Cup title before Sunday’s reverse singles.
Noah had been expected to pick either Julien Benneteau or Nicolas Mahut, with whom Herbert won two grand slam titles, but he surprisingly went for Gasquet instead, thus putting out a combination who had never played a competitive match together.
“It was a difficult decision because a lot of people did not have the same vision and even people within the group did not have the same vision,” Noah, who already led France to Davis Cup titles as captain in 1991 and 1996, told reporters.
Noah, however, stuck with his choice, which he made on Tuesday after Herbert and Gasquet showed great form at a training camp.
“It would have been much easier to make the politically correct decision and lose with honors,” he said.
“Personally, it’s good for me that they won because otherwise I would have been on a hot seat,” he added with a smile.
“We knew we’d have to be solid mentally,” said Gasquet. “We knew that we had everything to lose.”
Noah explained that Gasquet had been included in the team to replace Jo-Wilfried Tsonga or Lucas Pouille in the singles in case of injury.
“This was a factor because I don’t think either of our three doubles specialists (Herbert, Benneteau and Mahut) would have been able to play a best-of-five set Davis Cup match on a Sunday,” he said.
Belgium captain Johan Van Herck defended his selection after deciding not to make room in the pair for the in-form Goffin.
“A doubles is about who can play well with who and my feeling was that Ruben and Joris were the best pair for us today,” he said.
France will win the title before the fifth match if Tsonga beats world number seven David Goffin after both impressed during their singles wins on Friday.
“He has been thinking about this match for a while now and when he thinks about it, he sees himself winning it,” said Noah. “He is ready.”


ABU DHABI (Reuters) - Valtteri Bottas denied quadruple world champion team mate Lewis Hamilton the final pole position of the Formula One season on Saturday, leading a Mercedes one-two in Abu Dhabi Grand Prix qualifying.
The pole was the Finn’s second in a row, and fourth of the campaign, and he was determined to convert it into a victory after missing out in Brazil two weeks ago.
“I was so gutted in the last race being on pole and missing the win. I have a clear target for tomorrow,” said Bottas after lapping under the floodlights with a best time of one minute 36.231 seconds.
That was a track record, 0.172 quicker than his team mate and compared to Hamilton’s 2016 pole of 1:38.755.
Hamilton, who had been aiming for his 12th pole of the year, was behind Bottas after the first flying laps of the final session and was unable to improve on his time.
“What a lap! He just had an incredible qualifying and congratulations to him,” said Hamilton, who clinched his fourth championship in Mexico last month, as he saluted Bottas in front of the crowd.
“The last qualifying of the year and I gave it everything but I seem to have lost a little pace going into qualifying. Valtteri did an exceptional job, so I‘m really happy for him,” added the Briton, who won from pole last year.
“Either way, it’s been an incredible year of qualifying and one that I’ve really enjoyed.”
Hamilton will end the season with 72 career poles, an all-time record for the sport, after passing Michael Schumacher’s previous best of 68 at the Italian Grand Prix in September.
Mercedes have already clinched their fourth successive constructors’ championship, leaving Sunday’s race with little at stake for top teams beyond bragging rights to take into the winter break.
Ferrari’s Sebastian Vettel qualified third with Australian Daniel Ricciardo lining up alongside him on the second row of the grid for Red Bull.
Vettel beat Bottas to the victory in Brazil, his fifth of the year, and is on course to become the first non-Mercedes driver in four years to finish the championship in the top two with a 22 point advantage over third-placed Bottas.
While he hoped to challenge for the win on Sunday, the German did not sound overly confident.
“Tomorrow with the race pace I think we can be a bit closer but they (Mercedes) have been very strong,” said Vettel, also a four times world champion and three times winner at Yas Marina with Red Bull.
“It should be a fun race, overtaking is not always straightforward but not impossible here so let’s see.”
Kimi Raikkonen qualified fifth for Ferrari with Dutch 20-year-old Max Verstappen sixth for Red Bull.
Brazilian veteran Felipe Massa concluded the final qualifying of his Formula One career with 10th place for Williams.
“It’s a good way to retire, good races, good lap times. I‘m happy that I‘m finished with my head up and competitive,” he said.
“I want to have fun tomorrow. I have nothing to lose, risk everything you can. Let’s have fun.”
Renault seized the initiative in the tight battle for sixth place with Nico Hulkenberg qualifying seventh and Carlos Sainz 12th.
Millions of dollars of prize money are at stake on Sunday, with Toro Rosso four points clear of Renault who are in turn two ahead of U.S.-owned Haas.
Toro Rosso had France’s Pierre Gasly and New Zealander Brendon Hartley lining up 17th and last respectively while Haas had Denmark’s Kevin Magnussen 14th and Romain Grosjean 16th.


LILLE, France (Reuters) - France moved one step closer to a 10th Davis Cup title when Richard Gasquet and Pierre-Hugues Herbert beat Ruben Bemelmans and Joris De Loore 6-1 3-6 7-6(2) 6-4 to give the hosts a 2-1 lead in the final against neighbors Belgium on Saturday.
The French pair, in their first competitive match together, were down a break in the third set when Bemelmans suffered a meltdown, allowing Les Bleus to turn the situation around.
David Goffin put the visitors ahead by beating Lucas Pouille in the opening singles before Jo-Wilfried Tsonga leveled for 1-1 when he defeated Steve Darcis in the second singles on Friday.
Tsonga and Goffin face off in the first reverse singles on Sunday.


SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Fans flocked to the first event staged in mainland China by the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) as a new generation added their names to a proud martial arts history that stretches back thousands of years.
Ticket touts outside the sold-out Mercedes-Benz Arena in Shanghai did a brisk trade as Chinese fighters recorded five  victories and three defeats, welterweight Li Jingliang scoring the biggest win with his knockout of Zak Ottow in the co-main event.
In the main event, the crowd fell into a stunned silence after chanting the name of former middleweight champion Michael Bisping when he was knocked out halfway through the first round by hot prospect Kelvin Gastelum.
The real support, however, was reserved for the eight Chinese fighters on the card, many of them competing for the first time under the UFC banner.
Every heavy blow landed by a Chinese fighter was greeted with roars of approval from the partisan crowd, with the biggest cheers reserved for Li’s knockout of Ottow.
“I want to send this victory to every supporter who supports me here in China, I love you! And for every one of you in the audience here that witnessed this victory, this is for you!” Li shouted into the microphone following his win.
“China is the birthplace of martial arts! China is getting brighter and stronger!” he told his supporters, who answered his subsequent chants of “China!” by bellowing “Power!”
With events in Europe, Australia and Asia during 2017, the UFC is continuing its efforts to expand globally and the Chinese market represents an area of huge potential, with local fighters an integral part of building a loyal fan base.
“I like Li Jingliang, he’s Chinese and he fights well. He has blood lust,” 27-year-old aspiring fighter Tong Cheng told Reuters. “I‘m proud because China won a lot tonight.”
Cai Jingyu, a 40-year-old import-export executive, enthused over featherweight Wang Guan, who sent Alex Caceres crashing to the canvas on several occasions before winning on points.
“I like Wang Guan because he represents China. He is China’s dream,” Cai told Reuters.
“I think he will develop well and I hope that he will bring pride to Chinese people in the future.”
UFC Asia vice-president Kevin Chang was delighted with the turnout by fans and the performance by the Chinese fighters on show.
“They brought their best level and I think it shows where the level of talent has come to in China,” he told a media conference.


SYDNEY (Reuters) - Former world number one Jason Day will take a one-stroke lead into the final day of the Australian Open after firing up on the back nine and shooting a third-round two-under 69 in tricky conditions on Saturday.
Major winner Day will fancy his chances of getting his hands on the Stonehaven Cup for the first time, and grabbing his first win of the year, after moving to 10-under 203 for the tournament but he will first have to get away from Lucas Herbert.
The 21-year-old, who was paired with fellow Australian Day in the final grouping as he will be on Sunday, resolutely refused to wilt under the pressure and claimed a par 71 and second place.
“If I can hit shoot anything in the 60s, I think that will help kind of seal the deal,” said Day, who has won six of 13 tournaments where he held the lead after 54 holes.
“I’ve just got to focus on myself and just get myself around the golf course and not try and do anything too crazy.”
For a large part of the round it looked like no one would be making a move on moving day.
Defending champion Jordan Spieth grabbed a birdie on his final hole for the third successive round but it was another disappointing day for the world number two, who was simply unable to find his putting touch.
The 24-year-old Texan, coming off a seven-week layoff, settled for a 70 on a course he tore up to win the Stonehaven Cup in 2014 with a final-round 63 and admitted he would need something similar on Sunday with eight shots to make up on Day.
”What’s weird to me is these mid-range putts,“ he said. ”It’s one thing if they’re lipping out but quite a few of them were missed significantly on bad reads, and that’s rare for me.
“I‘m going to have to have some magic.”
Day parred his first 13 holes and it was only after overnight leader Herbert hit his drive into heavy rough off the 11th tee for a double bogey to lose his advantage that he made his move.
The 30-year-old almost chipped in for an eagle at the 14th before claiming his first birdie, which Herbert matched, and added two more at the 15th and 18th, where he putted for an eagle, after a bogey setback at the 17th.
Swede Jonas Blixt also had a long eagle putt on the 18th but had to settle for a birdie and his flawless 66 was good enough for a share of third place on seven-under with 2015 champion Matt Jones (68).
Cameron Smith, who won his maiden PGA Tour title with Blixt at the Zurich Classic of New Orleans this year, hit a 69 for fifth place on five-under.
Teenager Takumi Kanaya shot the best round of the day with a 65 for a share of eighth on four-under, the Japanese amateur hitting six birdies on the back nine in an explosive finish.


(The Sports Xchange) - Highlights of Friday’s National Basketball Association games:
Pacers 107, Raptors 104
Victor Oladipo scored 21 points, Bojan Bogdanovic added 19 and Lance Stephenson had 18 as the Indiana Pacers held off a late Toronto rally and won their fifth consecutive game 107-104 on Friday night in Bankers Life Fieldhouse.
The Pacers (11-8) outscored the Raptors (11-7) 57-44 during the final two quarters.
Kyle Lowry led Toronto with 24 points, and Norman Powell and Fred VanVleet each scored 16 as the Raptors lost their second in a row after a four-game winning streak.
Darren Collison added 17 points and eight assists for Indiana, which was 20 of 27 from the line while Toronto was 15 of 20.
Warriors 143, Bulls 94
Stephen Curry poured in 26 of his game-high 33 points in a second-quarter flurry, propelling Golden State to a thrashing of Chicago.
The Warriors eased to the win, their fifth without a defeat when following a loss this season, despite sitting out Kevin Durant with a sprained ankle and Draymond Green on a scheduled night off.
Green is expected to play, but Durant remains questionable, when the Warriors conclude a rare consecutive-night home sequence Saturday against New Orleans.
Blazers 127, Nets 125
Jusuf Nurkic totaled 29 points and 15 rebounds, including the tiebreaking 3-point play with 27.6 seconds remaining as Portland made the plays down the stretch and held on for a victory over Brooklyn.
Nurkic recorded his fifth double-double of the season by shooting 12 of 19 from the floor but made the biggest basket of the game for Portland, which shot 50 percent.
The game was tied at 123 with 38 seconds on a basket by Spencer Dinwiddie, but Nurkic’s hustle under the rim restored the lead for Portland. He scored off a wild scramble under the basket and converted the subsequent free throw for a 126-123 lead.
Hawks 116, Knicks 104
Atlanta notched their fourth victory of the season with a comeback win over New York.
Trailing nearly the entire first half, Atlanta (4-15) fought back in the third period and took control in the fourth when Marco Belinelli and Taurean Prince each hit a pair of 3-pointers late in the game.
Kristaps Porzingis led all scorers with 28 points while Courtney Lee added a season-high 26 for the Knicks (10-8). Dennis Schroder led Atlanta with 26 points.
Celtics 118, Magic 103
Boston erupted for 40 points in the first quarter and 73 in the first half -- both season highs -- on their way to a rout that sent Orlando to its seventh straight loss.
The 118 points also marked a season high for Boston and the Celtics also matched their season best with 17 3-pointers.
The win was also the 14th straight for the Celtics, winners of 17 of their last 18, over the Magic, who haven’t won at TD Garden since 2010.
Cavaliers 100, Hornets 99
LeBron James notched another triple-double, Jeremy Lamb’s final 3-point attempt missed and Cleveland hung on to beat Charlotte.
James finished with 27 points, 16 rebounds and 13 assists for his 57th regular-season triple-double and second this season. He was already in double-digit points, rebounds, and assists before the fourth quarter started.
The Cavs have won seven straight and eight in a row over Charlotte.
The Cavs beat the Hornets 115-107 on Nov. 15. Dwight Howard scored eight points with five rebounds and took five shots in that game; Friday he led Charlotte with 20 points and 13 rebounds.
Heat 109, Timberwolves 97
Long-range shooting and a sound defensive game helped lift Miami to a road win over Minnesota.
Miami set a season high with 19 threes, shooting 49 percent (19-for-39) from 3-point range, led by former Timberwolf Wayne Ellington (6-9) and Goran Dragic (5-8). Ellington’s 21 points off the bench led the Heat followed by Dragic’s 20.
Dion Waiters added 17 while Hassan Whiteside, who sat out Miami’s 125-122 overtime loss to Minnesota on Oct. 30, posted a double-double with 16 points and 10 rebounds.
Jimmy Butler and Andrew Wiggins each scored 18 points to lead the Timberwolves with Jamal Crawford and Shabazz Muhammad adding 10 each off the bench.
Pistons 99, Thunder 98
Detroit turned around its momentum and Oklahoma City once again found itself slipping after seemingly gaining some traction.
The Pistons trailed for much of the game but Avery Bradley’s 3-pointer with 2:01 remaining helped Detroit pull off a win at Chesapeake Energy Arena.
Andre Drummond led the Pistons with 17 points and 14 rebounds. Ish Smith added 15 points off the bench. Russell Westbrook had 27 points, 11 assists and 10 rebounds for the Thunder, who were coming off a win over Golden State on Wednesday.
Nuggets 104, Grizzlies 92
Nikola Jokic had 14 of his game-high 28 points in the fourth quarter as Denver survived a Memphis rally to beat the Grizzlies.
Jokic added 13 rebounds and eight assists to just miss his first triple-double of the season. Gary Harris and Jamal Murray scored 15 apiece and Kenneth Faried had 14 points and nine rebounds to help Denver improve to 8-2 at home this season.
The Nuggets were playing their first home game since Paul Millsap went down with a left wrist in Sunday’s loss at the Los Angeles Lakers. Denver is planning to be without its second-leading scorer for a few months, with surgery likely to repair ligament damage in the joint.
Pelicans 115, Suns 91
Anthony Davis had 23 points and nine rebounds and DeMarcus Cousin added 19 points and 10 rebounds as New Orleans used a 72-point first half to run away from Phoenix.
Davis and Cousins were a combined 15-for-24 from the floor with 19 rebounds and eight assists.
Jrue Holiday added 18 points for New Orleans, who has won three in a row to match their longest winning streak of the season. The Pelicans are 11-8 this season, their best 19-game start since going 13-6 to open the 2010-11 season.

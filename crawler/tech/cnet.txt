Jan Ingenhousz.
Jan Ingenhousz is a Dutch scientist from the 18th century. Born on this day in Breda in 1730, he is responsible for discovering photosynthesis.
Ingenhousz had a varied and exciting life. He began studying medicine at 16 before moving to London, where he successfully immunised hundreds of people who were at risk of smallpox.
Hearing of his achievements, the Austrian Empress Maria Theresa called for him to perform the same immunisation process in Vienna. After inoculating the entire Habsburg family, the Empress hired Ingenhousz as the family's doctor.
Ingenhousz had interests far beyond immunisation, however, which ultimately led to his discovery of the photosynthetic process. He was the first person to notice that oxygen was produced by leaves in sunlight, while carbon dioxide was produced in darkness.  
Ingenhousz published his findings in 1799, which has gone on to influence plant life research to this day. 


Smart luggage like that made by Bluesmart will soon face restrictions on many airlines.
Many major US airlines have announced restrictions on so-called smart luggage out of concern their lithium ion batteries may pose a fire risk.
Smart luggage tends to contain a USB port for charging devices, GPS to track the bag's location, remote locking and built-in weight sensors. Some even sport a motor to propel the bag for ease of movement through an airport.
These features require power that is often supplied by built-in lithium ion batteries, which contain highly flammable liquid. Worried the batteries could cause a fire in the cargo hold that would go undetected, airlines are instituting new rules that require fliers remove the batteries when they check their luggage and carry them into the passenger cabin.
"Beginning Jan. 15, customers who travel with a smart bag must be able to remove the battery in case the bag has to be checked at any point in the customer's journey. If the battery cannot be removed, the bag will not be allowed," American Airlines said in a statement on Friday. Delta and Alaska soon followed suit with similar policies on their flights.
In the past couple of years, the use of lithium ion batteries has been linked to fires and spewing smoke in a slew of products, including Samsung's now-canceled Galaxy Note 7, hoverboards, and Boeing's 787 Dreamliner.
The Federal Aviation Administration issued a warning about the batteries last year, urging airlines to examine the risks associated with transporting lithium batteries as cargo, including "the potential risk for a catastrophic hull loss." The alert covered batteries being transported as components and not those already inside devices such as laptops, tablets, phones or hoverboards.
However, many bags have batteries that can't be removed, and that has smart luggage makers like Bluesmart worried.
"We are saddened by these latest changes to some airline regulations and feel it is a step back not only for travel technology, but that it also presents an obstacle to streamlining and improving the way we all travel," Bluesmart told CNN.

Technically Incorrect offers a slightly twisted take on the tech that's taken over our lives.
That fantastic notch.
When Samsung mocks Apple, does it gnaw at Apple's soul?
I'm thinking about the recent Samsung ad (video below) that claimed the iPhone was always late to the party and never much fun. While the Galaxy range, of course, was the apogee of invention.
Here, you see, are some relevant words from Apple's vice president of iPhone, iPad and iOS product marketing, Greg Joswiak. 
Speaking to Tom's Guide, Joswiak offered, "It doesn't matter if you're first to a general idea, it's about being first to making it fantastic, and that's what we try to do."
To whom could he possibly have been referring, if not Apple's Korean rival?
Joswiak explained the difference between Apple's method and anyone else's like this: "Whether it's the chip team working  with our hardware team or our software team with our human interface  team -- it is one team here. No one else can match that."
Samsung didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.
Joswiak insisted that one example of this fantastic was the notch on the iPhone X. This controversial element, one which makes the phone not, as Apple claims, "all screen," has been derided by some as astonishingly ugly.
But Joswiak insisted: "With all of those components, this  is one of the most densely packed technology areas I think we've ever  done. It's one of the most sophisticated pieces of  technology we've ever done in such an incredibly small space."
I confess that when I first handled an iPhone X, I thought the notch wasn't quite as ugly as I'd feared. 
For Joswiak, however, it represents an ambition achieved.
"Forget all those stories you heard  about us trying to map fingerprints into the back, we  had a line of sight on how to do real facial recognition, in a way never  done before. It would be really hard to do, but we just didn't want to  do it the way others had, which could literally be spoofed with a  picture."
Some say, though, that the FaceID system on the iPhone X can be spoofed by, say, your child.
Apple didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.
We each have our own ideas of what's fantastic. Some think Apple's phones too simplistic, with an ecosystem that prevents personalization. Indeed, on  my recent visits to various carrier stores, I've often found salespeople  telling me they prefer Android phones precisely because they can "do  more" with them.
Others believe Apple makes the phones to which everyone should aspire. 
Still, the quest for fantastic is never over. 
Why, imagine the reactions at Apple when Consumer Reports concluded that the iPhone X wasn't quite as good as, oh, the iPhone 8.
Does the Mac still matter? Apple execs explain why the MacBook Pro was over four years in the making, and why we should care.

Kristina Omari is Lyft's new vice president of corporate development and investor relations.
Fresh off the heels of $1.5 billion in new investor funding, Lyft is hiring a vice president of corporate development and investor relations. Kristina Omari, former vice president of corporate development for Fitbit, has been tapped for the job.
"She brings a proven track record of helping companies grow in a fast-paced environment," Brian Roberts, Lyft's chief financial officer, said in a statement. "Her skills and experience will help Lyft continue to expand."
Compared with Uber, Lyft has long been the small dog in the ride-hailing world. It's received $4.1 billion in venture funding and is valued at $11.5 billion, whereas Uber has received $12.9 billion and is valued at $68 billion.
But Lyft has steadily grown over the last year as Uber has been mired in scandals. It's launched in dozens of new cities across the country and now is as ubiquitous as Uber. Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said he's aiming for a 2019 initial public offering in the next 18 to 36 months. But Lyft may be looking at an even earlier IPO.
Sources with knowledge on the matter told the New York Times in October that Lyft was exploring going public in 2018. To reportedly strengthen its position for an IPO, Lyft had been seeking additional investments. It's received two big rounds of funding this year, totaling more than $2 billion. Lyft declined to comment on whether hiring Omari had to do with a forthcoming IPO.
Omari has worked in investment, strategy and mergers and acquisitions for the past 20 years. She joins Lyft from Fitbit. Before that she worked for Adobe, Hewlett-Packard and Lehman Brothers. Omari also co-founded a nonprofit called BuildUp, which assists tech entrepreneurs from under-represented backgrounds.
"Lyft has had an amazing year," Omari said in a statement. "I can't wait to help the company continue delivering for passengers and drivers."

Life, disrupted: In Europe, millions of refugees are still searching for a safe place to settle. Tech should be part of the solution. But is it? CNET investigates.


With technology increasingly intertwined with all aspects of business, CNET@Work can help you -- from prosumers to small businesses with fewer than five employees -- get started.
If your small business is like most, it runs on Microsoft Office.
You're probably also pondering whether it's time to switch from the traditional perpetual-license versions of Office to an Office 365 subscription.
In theory, making that switch offers multiple advantages. You get a predictable cost instead of having to budget for upgrades every few years. You can install Office apps on multiple devices without activation hassles. Continuous updates and improvements remove some of the headaches of having to buy, install and manage upgrades every few years. You also get access to an ever-expanding assortment of cloud-based services.
But making the decision to switch is just the first step. Much more important is choosing the right Office 365 edition. And with more than a dozen editions to choose from, at prices ranging from $4 to $35 per user per month, it's easy to make the wrong decision.
So let's simplify the decision-making process. To get started, let's look at what's in Office 365. Every Office edition includes some combination of the following elements:
For the sake of this analysis, we assume your small business has no more than five employees. We also assume that you want access to the Office desktop apps for Windows. That removes many of the options that are designed for deployment in much larger companies that have a full-time IT department.
With those conditions set, you have three broad choices available.
If your business is literally a one-person shop, you might be tempted to choose an Office 365 Home subscription over one of the more expensive Office 365 business editions. That decision might even make sense if your requirements are modest enough.
Despite the name, there are no license restrictions to prevent you from using Office 365 Home in a business setting.
At $99 a year, each Office 365 Home subscription is tied to a single Microsoft account and gives you access to the full suite of Office desktop programs: Outlook, Word, Excel, PowerPoint and OneNote, with Publisher and Access available on Windows PCs only. It also upgrades the free OneDrive cloud storage associated with your Microsoft account to 1TB and upgrades your free Outlook.com account to a 50GB ad-free mailbox.
You can share this subscription with up to five different Microsoft accounts, each of which gets to install the Office desktop apps and has its own 1TB OneDrive allotment and upgraded mailbox. (For $30 less, you can purchase Office 365 Personal, which limits installation to one PC and one mobile device and can't be shared with others.)
Despite the name, there are no license restrictions to prevent you from using these apps in a business setting.
Who it's best for: Sole proprietors who already have a business email address and simply want convenient access to the latest Office desktop apps on up to five PCs.
Each Business Premium subscription costs $150 per year. Like the Home edition, it allows you to install the Office desktop programs on up to five PCs. It also includes Exchange Online email, with a custom domain, 1TB of secure OneDrive for Business cloud storage, and a collection of online collaboration features, including SharePoint and Microsoft Teams. Recent additions also include customer relationship management tools.
The biggest difference between home and business editions start with who manages the account. Each Office 365 Home subscription is managed by an individual user with a Microsoft account. Business and enterprise subscriptions belong to an organization and are managed centrally, with an administrator assigning licenses to users in the organization.
The Business Premium plans include Exchange Online email that is tied to one or more custom domains associated with your business.
The Business Premium plans include Exchange Online email that is tied to one or more custom domains associated with your business. You can create email aliases (such as sales@example.com) to make your small business look a bit bigger. (If you just want the Office desktop apps and OneDrive storage but don't need email, consider the Office 365 Business plan at $99 a year.)
Business and enterprise plans include security features you can't get with a Home or Personal subscription, including multifactor authentication, self-service password reset and alerts for security issues such as possible breaches.
Although you can buy one license at a time, the business editions of Office 365 include management tools that are designed for a dedicated IT department or a consultant. If you want to manage your own Business Premium subscription, make sure you're comfortable with technical tasks such as configuring DNS and MX records for your email domain.
Who it's best for: Small businesses that want each employee to have full access to Office desktop apps along with a custom email address associated with the business.
Microsoft offers a dizzying menu of options for its enterprise customers, including Office 365 ProPlus ($12 a month), which includes just the desktop programs and OneDrive for Business storage, as well as the Office 365 Enterprise E3 and E5 packages, which bundle online services with those apps.
Although these plans are intended primarily for large corporations, they might make sense for a small business such as a law office or health services consultant that has to comply with industry-specific regulations such as HIPAA. In addition to the services included with a Business Premium plan, the $20-a-month Enterprise E3 plan offers security and compliance tools, such as the ability to place a legal hold on an email account and data loss prevention tools.
An Enterprise subscription also future-proofs your growing business.
An Enterprise subscription also future-proofs your growing business. Unlike the Business Premium plan, which limits the total number of users to 300, you can purchase an unlimited number of enterprise licenses and mix and match the ProPlus, E1, E3 and E5 plans. Here, too, the management interface can be daunting and is best left to a professional consultant or a managed service provider.
Who it's best for: Businesses that need to project a professional image with email and file-sharing tied to a custom domain, as well as those who have to comply with industry-specific regulatory requirements.

While many bitcoin investors are basking in record valuations, some are coming to grips with an astonishing loss.
Cryptocurrency marketplace NiceHash said Wednesday that hackers stole the contents of its virtual wallet, making off with digital currency reportedly worth more $60 million. The breach was announced the same day Bitcoin rose 18.2 percent to  cross the $13,000- and then $14,000-per-coin trading milestones for the  first time.
NiceHash, a marketplace for cloud-based mining of cryptocurrencies,   made its announcement following an hours-long outage attributed to "maintenance" and reports from NiceHash users that their wallets had been emptied. NiceHash paused operations for 24 hours to determine how many bitcoins were stolen and how. But a Coindesk report suggests the wallet contained 4,736 bitcoins, worth about $66 million at current prices.
"This is a matter of deep concern and we are working hard to rectify the matter in the coming days," the Slovenia-based NiceHash said in a statement. "In addition to undertaking our own investigation, the incident has been reported to the relevant authorities and law enforcement and we are co-operating with them as a matter of urgency."
In the meantime, NiceHash is recommending users change their passwords.
Bitcoin has proved popular with currency traders, going on a massive bull run  in 2017. On Jan. 1 this year, bitcoin was priced at just under $1,000.  On Wednesday, the currency rose $2,170 to $14,095 before settling to  $13,696 as of this writing and giving it a market capitalization of $231  billion. 
This isn't the first time a bitcoin wallet has fallen victim to  security shortfalls. One of the most famous security lapses resulted in  bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox filing for bankruptcy in 2014 after losing nearly 850,000 customers and exchange bitcoins.

Valve has stopped accepting bitcoin for Steam purchases, the game developer said Wednesday, citing the cryptocurrency's high fees and volatility as the impetus behind the move.
Along with bitcoin's skyrocketing valuation, transaction fees charged to customers have also risen dramatically, from the 20 cents when the company enabled bitcoin support two years ago to $20 last week, Valve said in a blog post. The decision was announced the same day bitcoin rose 18.2 percent to cross the $13,000- and then $14,000-per-coin trading milestones for the first time.
"These fees result in unreasonably high costs for purchasing games when paying with bitcoin," Valve said in a statement. "The high transaction fees cause even greater problems when the value of bitcoin itself drops dramatically."
Valve began accepting bitcoin on its Steam service in 2016 to accommodate international users who might not have access to traditional payment options. Valve's move was part of a larger acceptance of the digital currency, which is now accepted by more than 100,000 merchants worldwide, including Microsoft, Dish and Overstock.
Bitcoin has also proved popular with currency traders, going on a massive bull run in 2017. On Jan. 1 this year, bitcoin was priced at just under $1,000. On Wednesday, the currency rose $2,170 to $14,095 before settling to $13,696 as of this writing and giving it a market capitalization of $231 billion.  
Still, the cryptocurrency's lack of government backing and regulation has led to volatility. After crossing the $11,000 mark for the first time a week ago, the currency lost 20 percent of its value in one day.
Valve said that volatility can complicate purchases made on Steam, a platform and social network for buying computer games and software.
"When checking out on Steam, a customer will transfer x amount of bitcoin for the cost of the game, plus y amount of bitcoin to cover the transaction fee charged by the bitcoin network," Valve said. "The value of bitcoin is only guaranteed for a certain period of time, so if the transaction doesn't complete within that window of time, then the amount of bitcoin needed to cover the transaction can change.
"The amount it can change has been increasing recently to a point where it can be significantly different," the game distributor said.
As a result, Valve said, support for bitcoin has become "untenable," but it said it might re-evaluate the cryptocurrency's fit into its business at a later date.
Update, 7:45 p.m. PT: Adds bitcoin crossing the $14,000 trading threshold.

Facebook's VR company is revamping the way you use its software starting Wednesday.
Every great hero has a secret lair.
Batman has his Batcave, filled with high-tech gear, cars -- and even a giant animatronic T-Rex. Charles Xavier has the School for Gifted Youngsters, with its secret underground bunker for storing aircraft and bad guys. And Superman has his hideaway, the Fortress of Solitude.
Now Oculus wants to make sure you have someplace you can call your own.
On Wednesday, Facebook's VR subsidiary will start offering a prerelease version of Oculus Home, a virtual room that you can outfit pretty much however you want. Think of it as a computer-generated Pottery Barn catalog, mixed with flourishes like an old video game console, art, rubber duckies and a bow with arrows you can shoot into the stars.
Don't see what you want? No problem. You'll eventually be able to create whatever items suit your fancy.
And everything can be interactive, like a private miniature golf course where you can play a round of nine holes. Just watch out for the giant robot spider.
All that's required is a $399 Oculus Rift headset, included touch controllers and a computer powerful enough to drive it all. Oculus Home software is free and will be released early next year as part of a larger free software package called Rift Core 2.0.
"What, this old thing? It's just my second home -- in VR."
"We put a lot of time and energy into making this stuff feel great," said Brandon Dillon, product manager for the project.
Along with Oculus Home, the Rift Core 2.0 will include a revamped app store that's easier to navigate than the existing one and a pop-up menu called Dash that makes it easier to switch between programs or respond to friends while in the middle of a game. Dash is designed to be used in pretty much any VR app.
VR, which relies on audiovisual headsets you strap over your eyes, can trigger psychological and neurological responses that make you feel immersed in a digital universe. Oculus believes the ability to customize VR to suit your tastes will be make you feel even more at home.
"We're giving you a space that belongs to you," said Nate Mitchell, an Oculus co-founder and head of product.
If you talk about VR with someone in the tech industry long enough, a book will inevitably come up in the conversation. It's called "Ready Player One."
The epic sci-fi novel by Ernest Cline, set in a futuristic United States, follows the adventures of a young man named Wade Watts as he seeks a treasure, battles an evil corporation and pursues a crush. But instead of taking place in space or some fantastical world, Watts is sitting in a room in the US, wearing a VR headset.
This 2011 book, which is liberally peppered with inside references to pop culture and games from the past three decades, became such an inspiration to VR enthusiasts that Oculus has been handing it out to new employees for years. The book was even among the favors given to fans at its first developer conference in 2014. (For his part, Dillon says he's more a fan of Neal Stephenson's VR epic "Snow Crash.")
It probably comes as no surprise then that one of the subplots of "Ready Player One," which will be released as a movie by Steven Spielberg early next year, is the virtual homes Watts and other characters created for themselves.
One, for example, created the ideal geek den, complete with old video games and trinkets from geek culture through the decades. Another constructed a virtual reproduction of his childhood town.
Watts built his home in an asteroid. There's even a nightclub in VR.
Mitchell smiled when I referenced these things. Oculus was so taken with these ideas that it even included retro-style video game consoles as objects you can place in your virtual home, just like characters from "Ready Player One."
Plug these retro-style cartridges into the game console in VR, hit the power button, and you can play a real game.
The bigger question is whether experiences like Oculus Home will convince people to use VR more, particularly because sales of VR headsets have been tepid.
Oculus gives "you the ability to dress it up, but they haven't changed the reason why you would go there," said Patrick Joynt, a vice president of research at  consultancy Frank N. Magid Associates. "It sounds like a fun piece of software that won't justify extended use."
Mitchell is more hopeful. He sees features like being able to visit rooms with friends becoming more common as VR experiences. Meanwhile, being able to work on documents and surf the web while in your VR home may help it feel like more than just a gee-whiz trick.
"We're making VR more into a computing platform," Mitchell said. "We want you to be able to do more with the device."
So I'm prepared for the adventures of Ian-Man, a superhero tech journalist whose lair will be to die for.
I just have to build it first.

Brave Software has embarked on the next phase of its plan to get you to use its browser -- and to build a privacy-first alternative to today's online ad industry.
The Brave browser blocks ads and ad trackers by default, a move that makes pages load faster and eliminates some prying into our lives online. But the startup doesn't want to rid the world of ads, only to come up with a system that delivers them with more privacy and security and fewer middlemen.
Brave Software's lion logo
Brave already lets you contribute payments to publishers and, more recently, YouTube stars who sign up with Brave. Ultimately, it plans to build a system in which those payments are funded by some of the ads you see. Taking a step in that direction on Wednesday, it started issuing the digital equivalent of the money it hopes will power that system.
"We're giving people a warm welcome and putting some change in their pockets," said company Chief Executive Brendan Eich, who previously co-founded and led the Mozilla Firefox browser.
"If we do it right, it'll create a new ecosystem into which we transplant the viable parts of the current ecosystem -- the users, the publishers and content creators, and the brands who advertise," he said. "We're just reconnecting them."
Brave's new system relies on technology called cryptocurrency. The best-known example is bitcoin, which has surged in value in recent months. But Brave relies on a newer, more sophisticated alternative, Ethereum, as a foundation for its technology, called the basic attention token, or BAT. At the current exchange rate, each BAT is worth about 21 cents.
On May 31, Brave raised $36 million in 24 seconds by selling 1 billion BATs. Brave wants these tokens to be what gets  exchanged in the online ad industry. An advertiser will give them to a publisher to show an ad, for example, or in the case of the Brave itself, to people using the browser who see an ad. So far about 1,100 publishers and YouTube stars have signed up for Brave's system, which lets them exchange BAT for dollars and other currencies through a partnership with online wallet company Uphold.
Ordinary Brave users can only spend BATs, not cash them out, but Brave hopes that'll become more useful in the future. For example, BATs could unlock news articles behind a paywall quickly and without requiring you to think about whether you really want to pay more than $100 for an annual subscription to paywalled publications like the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, Washington Post, New Yorker or, soon, Wired.
Cryptocurrencies are a new technology with something of a wild-west reputation still. Blockchain's meteoric rise inspires fears of a bubble bursting when speculation cools off. The US Securities and Exchange Commission just went to court to freeze assets of a cryptocurrency company called PlexCorps it alleges is a fraud. Bitcoin is used to, among other things, fund Nazi sympathizers who've been kicked off mainstream online sites.
But the underpinnings of cryptocurrency, a technology called blockchain, is no scam. Blockchain  promises new levels of trust and transparency for many types of transactions, and companies like Microsoft and IBM are embracing it wholeheartedly.
Brave will grant new and existing browser users digital currency that the browser can send to websites you visit.
Brave's attempt to address drawbacks of today's online ad technology --  problems like privacy invasion, website performance and the injection of dangerous "malvertising" into web pages -- relies on its BAT cryptocurrency. It sold 1.5 billion BATs in May, but it separately reserved 300 million for what's called a user growth pool. Wednesday's move distributes a tenth of a percent of them, but there will be other grants, Eich said.
Brave hopes the pool of tokens will attract new users to its browser and get existing users to set up BAT wallets within the browser, Eich said.
If you're using Brave and opt into the BAT system, the browser automatically divvies up BAT transfers each month depending on how much time you spend at each website. You can also "pin" specific recipients so they get a fixed percentage of your contribution.
Brave also hopes the BAT bonus will encourage YouTubers to sign up -- and publicize BAT and Brave. Brave by default blocks ads, so Brave users will be crimping advertising revenue distributed through YouTube's conventional payment mechanism.
Ultimately, Brave plans to build a broader BAT network that includes other software from other companies and, eventually, standardize it as part of the web.
Correction, Dec. 6 at 5:20 p.m.: Brave created 1.5 billion tokens, but only 1 billion of them were sold on May 31.
The Smartest Stuff: Innovators are thinking up new ways to make you, and the things around you, smarter.
'Alexa, be more human': Inside Amazon's effort to make its voice assistant smarter, chattier and more like you.


Ford and Chinese tech juggernaut Alibaba have signed a comprehensive deal to explore new ways of selling cars in China. 
The plan calls for exploring test-selling automobiles both online and at physical locations, Reuters reports. The multipronged "letter of intent" means that Ford and Alibaba will jointly explore opportunities around cloud computing, artificial intelligence, mobility services, digital marketing, and online retailing for at least three years.
According to Reuters, Ford will investigate leveraging Alibaba's Tmall online store to sell new vehicles, as well as its new "'auto vending machine' store concept," an idea that sounds more than a bit like what used car retailer Carvana has pioneered with increasing success. 
The vending machine will reportedly allow prospective customers to view a store's inventory on their phones, as well as summon them to the ground floor for a test drive or even purchase them outright. Eligible customers will be able to put 10 percent down on their new vehicles and finance the rest through Alibaba's Alipay.
Ford and Alibaba execs have signed an agreement to jointly explore new ways to sell cars and services in China.
Vehicles purchased online through Alibaba's Tmall may be delivered and serviced through Ford dealers, and indeed, the same could apply to vehicles found in the company's vending machine buildings.  
Ford will likely have to work hard to assuage any concerns of its dealer body with any Alibaba deal, as their existing network of retailers could grow concerned that they're being cut out of new vehicle sales and financing opportunities. Direct sales from automaker to consumer are possible in China and other global markets, but the practice is generally illegal in most US states. 
When Roadshow reached Alibaba and Ford reps by phone, neither immediately offered a comment on this story.
Update, Dec. 7: This story has been updated to reflect the signing of the letter of intent, along with new details about the agreement's areas of focus.


This is Xiaomi's Mi Pad. Mi, by the way, is pronounced as "me," not "my."
Here's a question: How do you read "Mi Pad?"
A European Union court has ruled that Chinese phone maker Xiaomi cannot register its Mi Pad tablet as a trademark because it thinks buyers will read it as "My Pad," which it says sounds too similar to Apple's "iPad," Reuters reported Wednesday.
The General Court added that the extra letter "M" isn't enough to differentiate the Mi Pad from the iPad in terms of visual presentation, according to a statement seen by Reuters.
Xiaomi submitted an application to the EU Intellectual Property Office to have "Mi Pad" registered as a trademark in 2014. It didn't succeed -- Apple filed a complaint upheld by the EUIPO in 2016 that consumers could confuse it as a variant of the iPhone maker's iPad.
It's not the first time Apple has taken action against Xiaomi, which is best known for its phones, for products that are too similar to its own in different ways. In 2014, it criticised the Chinese phone maker for coming up with phone designs that were too similar to the iPhone.
"We are studying this matter and evaluating our options," a Xiaomi spokesperson said. 
While Xiaomi is known in its home country of China and especially India (which really loves it), it remains an unfamiliar name in the States. Lei Jun, Xiaomi's CEO, said the company is "carefully evaluating" for the best time to crack the market, but there's word it could bring its phones to the country within the next two years.
Update, 11:16 a.m. AEST: Adds comment from Xiaomi.

It's Complicated: This is dating in the age of apps. Having fun yet?



Fresh from its earlier Prime Now launch in Singapore, Amazon now wants its customers in the island country to hop on its Prime service at S$8.99 a month ($6.70).
The Prime launch, a first in Southeast Asia, will see Amazon expanding its reach in the region even as Chinese rival Alibaba already sells merchandise from its online Taobao stores through a regional e-commerce subsidiary, Lazada. It also follows the US company's belated arrival in Australia yesterday.
Prime, a membership service that gives users complimentary two-day shipping and access to discounts and deals, is already live in Japan, China and India. Southeast Asia, a market expected to have a middle-income class of 400 million in 2020, remains a hugely lucrative market. 
Compared to the US' Prime, though, Singapore's version is lacking. While subscribers will get access to same day deliveries via Prime Now, it will only apply to some 5 million items from the international selection, compared to over 50 million in the US, with free shipping if they spend S$60 ($45). Singaporeans do, however, get access to Prime videos and Twitch Prime.
However, this does mean the previously free Prime Now service is gone, and users will have to subscribe to Prime if they even want to make a purchase locally, unlike local rivals Redmart and Honestbee, which do not require a subscription to order products such as diapers or groceries. Furthermore, items that previously shipped free to Singapore using AmazonGlobal Saver are not available, or are shipped separately but with fees. There's also no music or books included with the membership.
That said, Amazon may consider adding these services in the future.
"We aren't done yet," said an Amazon spokesperson to CNET.  "We will keep making Prime better and better in Singapore, adding more selection, finding ways to make it faster and adding more benefits including great quality entertainment." 
The localised Prime is also different from the US version, and if you're already a subscriber there, it doesn't automatically give you Prime benefits for the Singapore version.

Facebook employees are pretty happy with their employer.
If you work at Facebook, count yourself pretty lucky.
And not just for the free meals, on-site health care or new-parent benefits.
But those things probably factor into the social-networking giant being named the best place to work in 2018 by jobs site Glassdoor. And it's probably been a good experience for a while, seeing how this is the third year in a row Facebook has been atop Glassdoor's list of 100 best places to work, which is determined by employee feedback.
If you don't work at Facebook, there might still be hope for you. Glassdoor said there were 40 newcomers on this year's list, including video game maker Blizzard Entertainment (at No. 28 on the list) and wireless carrier T-Mobile (No. 79). There are also three veterans that have made the list every year since it was introduced 10 years ago, including management-consulting firm Bain & Company (No. 2), search giant Google (No. 5) and Apple (No. 84).
Certainly companies work hard to make their workplaces as appealing as possible to retain talented employees, but there is something mouthwateringly tantalizing in thinking about how In-N-Out Burger came in at No. 4 on the list.
 Here's the top 20:
1.    Facebook
2.    Bain & Company
3.    Boston Consulting Group
4.    In-N-Out Burger
5.    Google

Bitcoin has rebounded from a recent slump to notch another record valuation.
Bitcoin climbed 3.86 percent on Tuesday, crossing the $12,000-per-coin mark for the first time. At this writing, the cryptocurrency was trading at $12,116 against the US dollar, a little more than a week after passing $9,000.
Tuesday's trading price gives bitcoin a market capitalization of $203 billion and historic rise in valuation of 1,100 percent since the beginning of the year.
Despite its bull run, the cryptocurrency's lack of government backing and regulation has led to volatility. After crossing the $11,000 mark for the first time a week ago, the currency lost 20 percent of its value in one day.
It's also fed concern that bitcoin is on the edge of a bubble.
"This is a bubble and there is a lot of froth. This is going to be the biggest bubble of our lifetimes," hedge fund manager Mike Novogratz told Bloomberg at a cryptocurrency conference last week in New York.

Xiaomi CEO Lei Jun speaks with reporters Tuesday at Qualcomm's tech summit .
Xiaomi's still aiming for the US, but it's not quite ready to make a move.
Lei Jun, CEO of the fast-growing Chinese handset maker, on Tuesday said he's "carefully evaluating the best timeline to come to the US" with its smartphones. By selling some of its other devices in the country, like the Mi Box set-top box, it's able to learn about consumers and figure out the best approach, he said.
"We hope to be an immediate success in the US so we need a lot of time and careful preparation to achieve that," he said via a translator Tuesday during a roundtable with reporters at Qualcomm's tech summit in Hawaii. Earlier Tuesday, Jun said the Xiaomi Mi 7 would be one of the first devices to use Qualcomm's upcoming Snapdragon 845 processor. 
The comments from Jun about the US are a common refrain for the company. It has said for years that it would eventually launch phones in the US, but that the time wasn't right. 
While Xiaomi, Huawei and others have gained traction in markets like China, it's tougher to compete in the US. That market is still dominated by Apple and Samsung, with the companies holding 30 percent and 25 percent of market share, respectively, according to Strategy Analytics. 
In the third quarter, Xiaomi was the world's fifth biggest smartphone vendor. It more than doubled its shipments from 13.6 million a year ago, according to IDC, as it benefited from growth in the India market. 
Along with saying little about US plans, Jun also declined to comment about a possible IPO, say if his company is making foldable phones, or give details about a possible new laptop.
"The smartphone industry is still uber competitive," Jun said when asked about foldable phones. "Everyone is coming up with all sorts of innovation. Next year Xiaomi will definitely have a few products that steal customers hearts -- and also unique products."

Venture capitalist Shervin Pishevar says he's the target of a smear campaign.
A Silicon Valley venture capitalist accused of sexual harassment and assault is taking leave from his roles at Hyperloop One and Sherpa Capital to focus on legal action about what he calls a "smear campaign" against him.
Shervin Pishevar, an early investor in Uber, has been accused of sexually assaulting or harassing five women he met in a professional context, according to a Bloomberg report last month. Pishevar filed a lawsuit last month against Definers Public Affairs, accusing the public relations firm of carrying out a "malicious smear campaign."
Pishevar said Tuesday he had "decided to take an immediate leave of absence from my duties at Sherpa Capital and Virgin Hyperloop One, as well as my portfolio company board responsibilities, so that I can pursue the prosecution of my lawsuit, where I am confident I will be vindicated."
Definers Public Affairs has denied any involvement in work related to Pishevar.
The development is the latest in a slew of controversies involving men behaving badly in the tech world, as well as in entertainment, politics and media. The incidents have prompted several executives at venture capital funds to step down, and raises broader questions of how women are treated in these fields.
Sherpa Capital, the venture capital firm Pishevar co-founded, said it respected and supported his decision to take a leave of absence while he pursues legal action. The firm also said it planned to conduct an independent internal review to "ensure our practices and operations continue to reflect the highest professional and ethical standards.
"We recognize the inherent challenges of reporting misconduct, but note that Sherpa has never received a sexual harassment complaint," the firm said in a statement Tuesday.
Pishevar's alleged victims, who requested anonymity, accused him of exploiting the promise of a professional connection to make an unwanted sexual advance, Bloomberg reported. One of the accusers is Austin Geidt, Uber's head of global expansion, who was the target of unsolicited touching on her leg by Pishevar during a party, the news agency reported.
This isn't the first time Pishevar has been accused of sexual misconduct. He was arrested in May for allegedly sexual assaulting a 31-year-old woman in a London hotel, but wasn't charged, according to a Fast Company report in November. The City of London Comptroller's office  said later that a police report into the allegations was not compiled by or on behalf of the City of London police and "uses  terminology and details which are not familiar" to that police force.
Pishevar isn't the only VC to have allegedly harassed women. Steve Jurvetson, one of Silicon Valley's most high-profile venture capitalists, left his namesake firm, Draper Fisher Jurvetson, last month amid a sexual harassment investigation, according to Recode. Binary Capital co-founder Justin Caldbeck left his job in June after a story in The Information said he'd allegedly made sexual advances at female entrepreneurs.
Sens. Kamala Harris and Cory Booker told Bloomberg  on Monday that they were both donating Pishevar's campaign  contributions, $19,000 and $15,000 respectively, to organizations that  support women dealing with sexual violence.

The Girl Scouts of the USA is teaming with Raytheon to start a computer science program. 
In the Girl Scouts, tech's reach has moved beyond badges for skills like video game development and space science.
The Girl Scouts of the USA is building on its STEM education with the launch of a national computer science program for middle school and high school students. It's teaming up with defense contractor Raytheon to help prepare girls for careers in cybersecurity, robotics, artificial intelligence and data science.
The issue of diversity in the tech industry, more specifically the lack of it, has come to the fore in the past few years. Statistics show minorities and women make up less than 30 percent of the workforce, with the numbers of those in technical roles even lower.
"The progress to diversify the STEM workforce needs to be accelerated," Raytheon CEO Thomas A. Kennedy said in a press release Monday. "At a time when technology is transforming the way we live and work, we can -- and should -- show young women a clear path to taking an active role in this transformation."
The new program will run as a test in select areas starting early next year, and roll out nationwide by the fall. The Girl Scouts in 2019 will also hold a pilot Cyber Challenge, where students can put their coding skills to use.

Will Apple weep at this review?
It was, apparently, so close.
Yet the iPhone X, Apple's future of the smartphone, just wasn't quite good enough. Not quite, indeed, as good as the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus.
That's the curious conclusion of the testers at Consumer Reports. 
The consumer assistance publication contorts itself to be nice, like a British public head telling parents their child doesn't quite measure up to the school's requirements.
The X's camera is "fanstastic" and the display is "beautiful." The very best phones -- among which the X found a place -- are separated by a mere couple of points on a scale of 100.
The big question, however, is the phone's durability. The respected publication concluded that the 8 and 8 Plus "both proved hardier in a test designed to reproduce the drops and fumbles that can cause cracked screens and other damage."
As soon as the X emerged, my colleagues at CNET conducted their own durability and drop test and discovered that it cracked the very first time it was dropped. 
The glass back isn't exactly conducive to rugged treatment. Still, the 8 and 8 Plus have glass backs too. Consumer Reports insists these phones are "more resistant to breaking."
Battery life is another area in which iPhone X displeased the testers.
Even more painfully, perhaps, the publication ranks the X lower than the Samsung Galaxy S8, the S8+ and the Note 8. 
Apple didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Apple has, though, in the past had a slight contretemps with Consumer Report. At the end of last year, the publication offered a critical view of the MacBook Pro. The issue was ultimately resolved.
It's not as if Apple is the lone manufacturer to get a less than perfect review. Microsoft had its Surface tablets un-recommended by the publication. 
Still, as I've discovered in my wanderings around different carrier stores (and Best Buy), the most important thing is how a phone feels to you, how much you want to pay, how much you're embedded in an ecosystem and whether the store salesman would really prefer it if you buy something else.
Indeed, last week, a T-Mobile salesman happily told me that the 8 Plus was better than the X. (My colleague Scott Stein begged to differ in his review.)
I fear there won't be too many teeth gnashing in Cupertino. Apple reportedly sold 6 million iPhone X handsets over the Black Friday weekend.
Even more reassuringly, I haven't seen any reports of iPhone X devices exploding.
Does the Mac still matter? Apple execs explain why the MacBook Pro was over four years in the making, and why we should care.

YouTube is cutting access to Amazon's FireTV and Echo Show
If you've got an Amazon Fire TV, say goodbye to using it to watch YouTube.
The Google-owned video service is cutting access to the Amazon device on Jan. 1, a Google spokeswoman said on Tuesday. YouTube is also cutting access Tuesday for a second time to Amazon's Echo Show video device.
The moves signal that the ongoing battle between the world's biggest search engine and the world's largest online retailer may get messier in 2018.
"We've been trying to reach agreement with Amazon to give consumers access to each other's products and services," the Google spokeswoman said in a statement. "But Amazon doesn't carry Google products like Chromecast and Google Home, doesn't make Prime Video available for Google Cast users, and last month stopped selling some of Nest's latest products. 
"Given this lack of reciprocity," she said. "We are no longer supporting YouTube on Echo Show and FireTV. We hope we can reach an agreement to resolve these issues soon."
Google and Amazon have been in an intensifying competition on multiple fronts, with Amazon pushing deeper into Google's turf of online advertising and Google moving into Amazon's territory of e-commerce and smart speakers. This competition over the years has spilled out into public view and often resulted in fewer options for customers. Still, it's unclear whether Google's latest move should be seen as a negotiating tactic by the search giant or a sign of more fighting between the two companies.
In one of the most recent spats between the two tech powerhouses, YouTube vanished from Amazon's Echo Show device in September, with Google saying Amazon's implementation of YouTube on the Echo Show violated its terms of service. The Show, unveiled in May, is essentially an Amazon Echo smart speaker with a built-in touchscreen display. YouTube returned to the Show last month, just in time for Black Friday, by directing users to YouTube's website, but Google is cutting access again.
"Echo Show and Fire TV now display a standard web view of YouTube.com and point customers directly to YouTube's existing website," an Amazon spokeswoman said. "Google is setting a disappointing precedent by selectively blocking customer access to an open website. We hope to resolve this with Google as soon as possible."
Two years, ago, Amazon banned Google's Chromecast and Apple TV from its website, helping Amazon direct its customers toward its own Fire TV and away from competing devices. Amazon at the time said the move was to ensure its customers were buying the best devices for watching its Prime Video service and to help "avoid customer confusion."
Apple said earlier this year that Prime Video is coming to Apple TV. Prime Video isn't available on Google Chromecast or Android TV devices, but it is on mobile Android devices.
Google and Amazon have been in a high-stakes battle to get their devices into your home. Amazon released the Echo, a voice-controlled speaker and smart home hub, in 2014. Google followed suit last year with its rival Google Home. Apple plans to join the market with its $350 HomePod. Still, Amazon is the dominant leader in the smart speaker world, with Echo devices owning 73 percent of the market. Google is far behind with 27 percent, according to a report by Consumer Intelligence Research Partners.
In September, Amazon unveiled a new line of Echo devices, including the Echo Plus, the Echo Spot and an updated Echo. In October, Google unveiled a slew of hardware products to get its Assistant, a digital helper akin to Amazon's Alexa and Apple's Siri, to more users. The new devices include an updated version of the Google Home smart speaker and a Google Home Mini device. 
Despite the direct competition between the Google Home and the Amazon Echo, the two companies continue to work together for some connected home devices. For instance, Google's parent company, Alphabet, continues to let people control their Nest thermostats and cameras using an Echo. The Nest thermostat is available on Amazon, but last month other Nest products disappeared from the site, including the Nest Thermostat E, a cheaper version of the device, and the Nest Secure alarm system. 
Right now Google Home can't be bought on Amazon either. Neither can Google's Chromecast video streaming device. Google has been in negotiations with Amazon to try to get both company's products on each of their platforms, a person familiar with Google's thinking told CNET. That could mean, for example, having Prime Video, Amazon's streaming video service, on Google's Cast streaming products.
"It should be about users of Google and Amazon, not Google and Amazon," the person said.

Lyft just got an extra $500 million boost in funding.
Lyft's latest round of funding just got bigger.
The ride-hailing company announced in October that it had received a $1 billion investment, led by Google-parent Alphabet's investment arm CapitalG. On Tuesday, Lyft said the funding had been increased by $500 million, for a grand total of $1.5 billion. The influx of cash could help Lyft in its battle to grab market share from rival Uber.
"It's been a breakout year for Lyft, made possible by our team members, drivers, and passengers," Lyft President John Zimmer said in an emailed statement. "We will continue to invest in our community and look forward to an even bigger 2018."
Compared with Uber, Lyft has long been the small dog in the ride-hailing world. Before now, it's received $2.6 billion in venture funding, whereas Uber has received $12.9 billion and is valued at $68 billion. With this extra $500 million in funding, Lyft is now valued at $11.5 billion.
Lyft has grown steadily over the last year as Uber has been mired in scandals. Since January, Lyft has launched in dozens of new cities across the country and now is nearly as ubiquitous as its rival. It's currently available in all 50 states and just launched internationally in Toronto, Canada.
Ridership is also up. From January to October this year, Lyft said it gave 500 million rides -- that's more than all its rides in the previous four years combined.
For this new round of funding Lyft is partnering with Fidelity Management & Research Company and Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan, along with a handful of other existing investors.
"Through our investment in Lyft, Ontario Teachers' will be participating in the continued growth of ridesharing miles traveled in North America," said Nicole Musicco, senior managing director of public equities for the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan, which is headquartered in Toronto.
Alphabet's investment in Lyft comes as Uber is currently locked in a legal battle with Waymo, Alphabet's self-driving car unit. Waymo accused Uber of stealing its autonomous vehicle technology; Uber calls Waymo's claims "baseless." The trial is slated to begin in February.

Life, disrupted: In Europe, millions of refugees are still searching for a safe place to settle. Tech should be part of the solution. But is it? CNET investigates.


The US government has cracked down on a company it says is running a "full-fledged cyber scam," bilking as much as $15 million out of investors excited by the possibilities of the financial and technological revolution known as cryptocurrency.
The US Securities and Exchange Commission filed a lawsuit Friday against a company called PlexCorps, its principal executive Dominic Lacroix and his partner, Sabrina Paradis-Royer to stop them from receiving money from a fund-raising process called an initial coin offering. Its case persuaded a court to freeze the PlexCorps assets as a result, the SEC said Monday.
PlexCorps didn't respond to a request for comment. On Facebook, though, PlexCorps said it's not a fraud and that it's cooperating with Canadian financial authorities and the SEC. 
PlexCorps promises an easy-to-use avenue for people to get involved in the complicated world of cryptocurrencies, but the SEC says its PlexCoin is a "scam."
Over and over, new technology has enriched not just titans like Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos but also ordinary folks who bought in at the right time. Google stock today is worth 20 times the $50 per share it sold for in 2004. But just because new tech generates new wealth doesn't mean that every new idea means easy money.
PlexCorps and Lacroix had promised a 1,354 percent profit in just 29 days to those who participated in a process called an initial coin offering (ICO) -- a sale of the digital assets central to the cryptocurrency technology. But according to the lawsuit -- the first from the SEC's new Cyber Unit -- "PlexCorps and the PlexCoin Token are a scam."
Why? Among other things, the lawsuit said, "Lacroix was a known recidivist securities law violator in Canada; the proceeds from the PlexCoin ICO were not destined for business development but instead were intended to fund Lacroix and Paradis-Royer's expenses including home decor projects; and there was no reasonable basis to project returns on investment."
In its statement, PlexCorps denied wrongdoing: "We are being depicted as robbers, scammers and fraudsters everywhere in the media. They are smearing our name with some allegations that can sometimes be false or misleading ... All PlexCoin purchased were distributed and we are now listed on many cryptocurrency exchanges. We claim that PlexCoin is not a fraud since no one had their money stolen from us and ... all purchased PlexCoin were distributed."
PlexCorps didn't address specific SEC allegations, for example that it didn't really have a large team of experts or that the PlexCoin iCO was an "illegal offering of securities" lacking required paperwork called a registration statement. However, it promised a news release about the matter "in the next few days."
Hundreds of companies are trying to cash in on cryptocurrencies -- no surprise given the real promise of the technology combined with the stunning rise in value of the best-known cryptocurrency, bitcoin. A newer alternative, Ethereum, promises even more sophisticated technology and has been surging in value as well.
The PlexCorps website shows various cryptocurrency-based services, but the US SEC says the company is a fraud.
Cryptocurrencies often have a dual nature. They can serve as a currency, something that can be exchanged for goods and services. And they can be considered an investment, something that will appreciate in value. In the case of PlexCoin, PlexCorps was treating it as this latter category. As such, laws governing the sales of securities apply, the SEC said.
"We acted quickly to protect retail investors from this initial coin offering's false promises," Robert Cohen, chief of the SEC's Cyber Unit, said in a statement.
The SEC also warned in November that celebrities are potentially liable for any misconduct touting initial coin offerings. Boxer Floyd Mayweather and socialite Paris Hilton both promoted cryptocurrencies. "I'm gonna make a $hit t$n of money on August 26th," Mayweather said on his Instagram account in July.
The SEC's new lawsuit seeks to get PlexCorps, Lacroix and Paradis-Royer to "disgorge their ill-gotten gains" along with interest, bar them from ICOs and pay a fine.
The Quebec Autorité Des Marchés Financiers in Canada also cracked down on PlexCorps in July. The cases reveal just how important digital information has become. According to the SEC's lawsuit:
The assets were frozen before Monday, the day when a 90-day Stripe administrative hold was set to expire and about $810,000 was to be transferred to the defendants, the lawsuit said.

Uber has lost its appeal to the UK's Supreme Court over a ruling that its drivers should be given workers' rights.
The ride-sharing company made the appeal following a ruling in November that stated it must treat its drivers as workers. It submitted a request to appeal directly to the Supreme Court, which has been turned down. This means the UK's Court of Appeal will hear the case first.
"Now that Uber has been denied permission to go straight to the Supreme Court, they should take this opportunity to work with their drivers instead of fighting them at every stage. We've already beaten Uber twice and are prepared to do so again in the Court of Appeal," said Yaseen Aslam, co-lead claimant and member of drivers' union, the Independent Workers Union of Great Britain (IWGB).
Uber declined to comment on the ruling.
Correction, Dec. 5 at 11:18 a.m. ET: This story originally misstated the nature of the Supreme Court's decision. The ruling turned down Uber's bid to bypass the Court of Appeals and go straight to the Supreme Court.  


Facebook, Twitter and Google faced grillings from lawmakers on Capitol Hill.
It was about an hour and a half into a hearing with the Senate Intelligence Committee when Sen. Dianne Feinstein laid into Facebook, Google and Twitter.
"I don't think you get it," she began. "You bear this responsibility. You've created these platforms, and now they are being misused. And you have to be the ones to do something about it. Or we will."
The tech giants were being grilled by Congress over Russian trolls abusing their services to meddle in last year's US election, and the California Democratic lawmaker had had it.
It was just one of very public tongue-lashings the Silicon Valley companies received over the course of three high-tension congressional panels last month, held over a two-day span. In some ways, the hearings were anticlimactic. The three companies only sent their general counsels instead of their famous CEOs -- a point several lawmakers bemoaned during the public questioning.
But in another way, it was a spotlight that symbolized a turning point for Silicon Valley: For a long time, the tech industry has enjoyed a rosy relationship with the government and the public, but now, the honeymoon's over.
For decades, Silicon Valley -- the state of mind, not merely the region 40 miles south of San Francisco -- was seen as the fertile crescent of the future. It's a place where entrepreneurs saw themselves as strivers who embody the American spirit and the ingenuity that feeds it.
Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg visited a Ford factory in Michigan, in an attempt to get out of his San Francisco "bubble."
The tech industry says it's altruistic. Google is organizing the world's information, Facebook is connecting the world and bringing it closer together. And because the companies created jobs, wealth and services that genuinely make life easier, they also had a cozy rapport with policymakers. Their lobbying arms focused on benign stuff like tax reform and professional visas.
Then the presidential election happened -- the bitter, exhausting, Russian-meddled tweet-fest that engulfed the country as shocker after shocker led to the upset election of Donald Trump. The more than year-long campaign season, which even Trump described on his election night as sowing "wounds of division," exposed many things about Silicon Valley that Congress, and much of the country, did not like.
The tech giants have faced controversy before, but this time is different. Until now, no transgression reached the caliber or seriousness of the Russian meddling scandal. One reason lawmakers are being so aggressive is that they feel threatened, says Chris Hoofnagle, a professor at the UC Berkeley School of Information. Modern elections are played out on social media, and Facebook, Google and Twitter have all the power.
Tech CEOs, like Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey, have been under pressure to fix the problems on their platforms. 
"Both Democrats and Republicans are afraid," says  Hoofnagle. "This is the new playing field, and they can't control it."
After decades of goodwill, now it seems like the tech giants can't do anything right. Aside from the election controversy, Google, Twitter and Facebook have faced other pitfalls: Violent content. Online bullying. Algorithms gone haywire.
Google has been especially egregious at spreading fake news during national tragedies -- after both the Las Vegas and Texas shootings, the search engine promoted misinformation about the shooters. The company's woes go beyond its search engine, too. YouTube, owned by Google, has been under fire for letting disturbing videos aimed at kids past its filters.
Twitter has been a cesspool of bullying and a haven for white supremacists. Jack Dorsey, the company's chief executive, is playing a years-in-the-making game of whack-a-mole, overhauling the social network's abuse policies to make the environment less toxic. Last month, he suspended Twitter's verification program, which issues coveted blue check marks to notable Twitter accounts, partly because the badge gave too much of a spotlight to white supremacists.
Facebook Live, the social network's live video-streaming service, has broadcast killings, rape and other violence unchecked over the internet. Meanwhile, Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's founder, took a tone-deaf virtual reality tour though hurricane-ravaged Puerto Rico, and was swiftly called out for his cluelessness.
And that's not a complete list of their missteps.
"What Google and Facebook did, one of the ways they sold their products, was with emotion," Hoofnagle says. He cites their lofty mission statements, like Zuckerberg's "messianic" proclamation to connect the world. So when things go awry, the severe blowback is a consequence of leaning so hard into that emotional pitch. "Instead of just, 'I dislike Facebook,' it's 'I hate Facebook.'"
For much of this year, the tech giants have been on the defensive. Zuckerberg, after infamously saying last year that the notion of fake news affecting the election was "pretty crazy," began this year by posting a nearly 6,000-word manifesto on Facebook's new role in the world. He coupled that with a nationwide tour he said was meant to discover how Americans outside his San Francisco bubble live. It was slickly photographed and documented every step of the way. The trip even had its own logo.  
Zuckerberg drew criticism for taking a VR video tour of the hurricane devastation in Puerto Rico.
Google has sought to make nice with steel towns and the heartland as well. In October, CEO Sundar Pichai traveled to Pittsburgh to introduce a new program called "Grow with Google," aimed at training people for the "changing nature of work." It's a change that Google and the other tech giants had a major hand in making with their software and automated technology. Part of the program includes Google hosting sessions in which its staffers travel across the country, teaching people how to use Google's employment tools. The tour kicked off last month in Indianapolis. In all, Google pledged $1 billion to work-related initiatives around the world.
As Silicon Valley companies have grown to become the most powerful corporations in the world, their actions have had unintended consequences. In the Valley, the idea of "disruption" is celebrated. It stands for that relentless, scrappy drive to remake industries to be, in the eyes of entrepreneurs, faster, smarter, more efficient.
"That notion of disruption sounds interesting," says Bob O'Donnell, an analyst with Technalysis Research. "But when it comes to people's day-to-day lives, that's not necessarily what they want," if it means lost jobs or reading misinformation.
And that's something the tech giants will have to take to heart from here on out.

A lighter of Android Oreo for smaller devices.
Entry-level phones may cost less than big hitters, but they come at the cost of space, speed and efficiency. Google's looking to change that with Android Go. 
Android Oreo (Go Edition) will launch Wednesday as part of the Android Oreo 8.1 rollout, and all Android Oreo devices with 512MB to 1GB of memory will be optimized for Android Go. Google said this will allow them to function properly as smartphones while doubling their available storage space. The rollout includes:
Android Go, introduced at Google I/O earlier this year, offers possibilities for Android users in emerging markets, kids trying out their first phones or anyone who needs a low-cost backup phone. In a Google blog post, Android director of product management Sagar Kamdar noted that of the 2 billion Android users around the world, more are in India than the US.
"To make sure billions more people can get access to computing, it's important that entry-level devices are fully functioning smartphones that can browse the web and use apps," Kamdar said.


Facebook's Sheryl Sandberg shared her stories about sexual harassment and urged companies to implement clearer policies to investigate claims of sexual misconduct at work.
A spotlight has been placed on sexual harassment and assault in the past month, with women around the world using the hashtag "MeToo" to share their experiences.
In a lengthy Monday Facebook post, Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg addressed Silicon Valley's diversity issues, and noted a concern that the movement could backfire.  
Sandberg said women don't need to just be hired, they also need to be mentored. "Four years ago, I wrote in Lean In that 64 percent of senior male managers were afraid to be alone with a female colleague, in part because of fears of being accused of sexual harassment." This, Sandberg said, is a factor that hurts women in the industry.
"The percentage of men who will be afraid to be alone with a female colleague has to be sky high right now," she wrote. "Whether [equality] means you take all your direct reports out to dinner or none of them, the key is to give men and women equal opportunities to succeed."   
The 1992 presidential race was once summed up in a pointed phrase: “It's the economy, stupid.”

Today, as headlines are...
Sandberg's post comes as high-profile scandals over alleged sexual misconduct by powerful men emerge, beginning with Hollywood's Harvey Weinstein scandal. The list includes Pixar co-founder John Lasseter, tech evangelist Robert Scoble and comedian Louis C.K., whose specials were removed from Netflix. 
Sandberg, a former executive at Google, pointed to instances of unwanted sexual advances from people in the industry, but noted they never came from her bosses. A power imbalance was the issue, she said, explaining "in every single one of these situations, they had more power than I did."
She outlined six steps in which organizations can help fight the issue:
"We have to be vigilant to make sure this happens," wrote Sandberg. "I have already heard the rumblings of a backlash: 'This is why you shouldn't hire women.' Actually, this is why you should."
It's not Sandberg's first time voicing about issues related to women in the workplace. In a Wall Street Journal op-ed in October, she pointed out that gender gaps at work remain despite more companies committing to gender diversity.

YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki says the video-sharing site will increase the number of employees reviewing content on the site to more than 10,000 in 2018.
YouTube plans to add more human moderators and to increase its use of machine learning to cut down on content that violates the video-sharing site's policies.
YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki said in a blog post published Monday evening that Google will increase the number of content moderators and other employees reviewing content and training algorithms to more than 10,000 in 2018. Wojcicki said it's taking the lessons learned in the past year tackling violent extremist content and applying it to other "problematic" content.
"Our goal is to stay one step ahead of bad actors, making it harder for policy-violating content to surface or remain on YouTube," Wojcicki wrote in her blog post.
The changes come in the wake of an advertiser boycott of the Google-owned video site over videos with children that were the target of sexually inappropriate comments. YouTube killed hundreds of accounts, removed more than 150,000 videos from the platform and turned off comments on more than 625,000 videos targeted by alleged child predators.
The company will also focus on training its machine-learning algorithm to help human reviewers identify and terminate accounts and comments violating the site's rules. Machine learning, a key aspect of artificial intelligence, has helped the company remove 150,000 videos containing violent extremist content since June, a process that "would have taken 180,000 people working 40 hours a week" to complete, Wojcicki said.
The company's moderators are now removing five times more videos than they used to, thanks to machine learning, she said. Those algorithms flag 98 percent of the videos removed for extremist content.
Wojcicki also said YouTube will take a "new approach" to advertising on the site, deciding which channels and videos should be eligible for advertising.
"We are planning to apply stricter criteria, conduct more manual curation, while also significantly ramping up our team of ad reviewers to ensure ads are only running where they should," she wrote.
YouTube said last month it had removed ads from nearly 2 million videos and more than 50,000 channels that tried to pass off as family-friendly but that featured inappropriate content. The company also outlined new rules to make YouTube safer for kids.
Update, Dec. 5 at 11:15 a.m. PT: Clarifies that Google is increasing the number of people reviewing content, not just YouTube.

It's been a long time coming, but Amazon has finally launched in Australia.
The world's largest e-tailer launched the full-fledged version of its Australian retail site on Monday, giving customers Down Under the opportunity to buy everything from gadgets to clothing at Amazon.com.au. (The site has hosted a Kindle store since 2013, but Aussies haven't been able to buy anything more than ebooks).
For shoppers used to next-day delivery and Amazon Prime, Amazon's arrival in Australia may seem pretty late. After all, the company has been operating in the US for more than two decades. And it already has a well established overseas presence; it began selling books in the UK and Germany in 1998, just three years after launching in the US.
The company says it's focused on the long game in Australia. Country manager Rocco Braeuniger says Amazon hopes to "earn the trust and the custom of Australian shoppers in the years to come."
The Australian store launched with 23 categories, including electronics, DVDs, PCs and software. It also stocked general merchandise, like clothing, baby and beauty products. 
Amazon.com.au also sells Kindle eReaders (which were previously only available in Australia through third-party retailers) and the Fire TV Stick streaming device. 
It's a decent showing for Amazon.com.au's first day of trading as an online department store. Still, it's a fraction of what Amazon offers in other markets, like the US and UK. In the US, the retailing behemoth offers everything from fresh groceries to music and video streaming. It also sells the Amazon Echo range of smart speakers, powered by its voice assistant Alexa.
Amazon confirmed it will launch at least some of the Echo range in Australia, alongside Alexa and Amazon Music Unlimited, in early 2018. Aussies also anticipate fresh grocery delivery -- the company has been quietly hiring for its AmazonFresh business since the start of the year -- though there's no official launch news on this front.
Aussies will still have to wait for is Amazon Prime. The subscription service offers unlimited free delivery for $99 a year as well as perks like two-hour delivery, free TV streaming and deals delivered through Alexa. Amazon says it will bring Prime shipping benefits to Aussies from mid-2018, though there's no word yet on price or perks. 
In the US, Amazon offers two-hour shipping thanks to a strong network of fulfillment centers that were built up over 20 years of operations, as well as its in-house Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) shipping service. In Australia, the company is starting without FBA and just one warehouse on the outskirts of Melbourne in Australia's southeast, so instant gratification might be a while off. 
So where to from here? 
There's no doubt Amazon's push into Australia will help it get a stronger foothold in the Asia Pacific region as part of its broader global expansion plans. Amazon brought its popular Prime membership service to China and India last year, and bought Middle East e-commerce site Souq.com this year. But with rivals like Chinese giant Alibaba waiting in the wings, Amazon will be looking for new ways to grow sales, which stood at $43.7 billion for the third quarter of 2017.
It's still early days for Amazon in Australia and the hype is strong. It remains to be seen if shoppers will stick around for the long haul.

Target's new in-store "Wallet" mobile-payments system.
Target has added a new mobile-payments system to its iOS and Android apps that aims to speed along customers' checkout times in stores.
The new system, dubbed Wallet, uses a bar-code scanner at checkout to combine payment and Cartwheel coupons in a single transaction, the retailer said in a statement Monday.  Cartwheel is the retailer's digital coupons platform, offering users an app that lets them browse the retailer giant's current in-store offers.
"Wallet in the Target app makes checkout easier and faster than ever," Mike McNamara, Target's chief information and digital officer, said in a statement. "Guests are going to love the convenience of having payment, Cartwheel offers, Weekly Ad coupons, and GiftCards all in one place with Wallet."
Wallet is currently limited to use with Target's REDcard credit card  and debit card. The ability to redeem Target gift cards with Wallet is  coming soon, Target said.
Target's Wallet announcement comes two years after rival retailer Walmart jumped into the mobile-payments business, becoming the first US retailer to make its own push for consumers to use their smartphones as mobile wallets. Walmart Pay, which is based on a QR code checkout system, also differs from Target's Wallet by supporting all major credit and debit cards as well as prepaid and Walmart gift cards.

Technically Incorrect offers a slightly twisted take on the tech that's taken over our lives.
These are, apparently, much more intuitive. For an engineer, that is.
Poor thing.
There he was having to slum it in the real, retrograde world and everything was just so Neanderthal. 
That was the impression left by a Monday tweet reportedly emitted by Vahid Kazemi. According to his LinkedIn profile, he's a software engineer at Google-owned Waymo. The self-driving car company didn't immediately respond to a request seeking to confirm Kazemi's position.
Captured by Jalopnik, the tweet -- sadly since deleted -- offered this pained thought: "Have been driving in LA with a rental car that doesn't have the  autonomous features that my own car has. Almost crashed ten times and  ran over five people in two days! Humans aren't designed to drive cars!"
He's quite right. What were we designed for? Procreation? Sun worship? Eating messily? That's about it, isn't it?
Some might say that one small problem with engineers is they assume everything must be engineered for some purpose. I fear that actually we were just dumped here for a bit of a joke.
Talking of which, Kazemi seems to be lamenting the fact that his tweet reached a wider audience. 
Bad jokes quickly escalate on Twitter. Note to self only tweet exactly what you mean.
Sometimes, bad jokes on Twitter do just die. Occasionally, though, they get picked up because some see them as indicative of more than mere bad humor. Haughty Google-engineer superiority, for example.
Kazemi didn't immediately respond to request for comment sent on LinkedIn.
Of course, Kazemi's tweet does throw up a painful reality. As humans are forcibly transitioned into the self-driving world, there will be an awkward period.
It's already started. All too often when self-driving cars have been involved in accidents, Google (and other companies) have been keen to blame humans. 
It was only last year, for example, that Google finally accepted that its technology was partly to blame for a crash.
That's the danger of believing your own publicity. Last month, for example, a self-driving bus in Las Vegas got into a little scrape with a truck.
The City of Las Vegas offered this statement: "Had the truck had the same sensing equipment that the shuttle has the accident would have been avoided."
Dear human, you are stupid. You don't think like a machine. Aren't you embarrassed?

Views of Facebook's new office at Rathbone Place in London.
Facebook opened its new London headquarters on Monday with the announcement that it is creating 800 new jobs in the UK.
The new office is situated just off Oxford Street, the British capital's central shopping hub, and incorporates the company's first in-house startup incubator called LDN_LAB.
"Today's announcements show that Facebook is more committed than ever to the UK and in supporting the growth of the country's innovative start-ups," said Nicola Mendelsohn Facebook vice president for Europe, the Middle East and Africa.
"The UK's flourishing entrepreneurial ecosystem and international reputation for engineering excellence makes it one of the best places in the world to build a tech company."
The new hires will bring Facebook's UK headcount to 2,300 people by the end of 2018. More than half the staff working in the new office will focus on engineering, making it the company's largest engineering hub outside of the US. The opening of the new office marks the tenth anniversary of the social networking giant's presence in the UK.
"It is great to see a world-leading company like Facebook continuing to invest in London's renowned tech ecosystem, despite the uncertainties surrounding Brexit," said Julian David, CEO of techUK, the British tech industry promotional body. "The message is clear: London is open, and tech is the flag bearer."

The Australian government wants to know if internet giants like Facebook and Google are unfairly damaging news media in the country. 
The Australian Compeition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) said on Monday it'll be starting an inquiry to examine how new digital platforms are impacting Australian journalism and advertising, and to see if that impact benefits Australians or detriments them.
"Through our inquiry, the ACCC will look closely at the impact of digital platforms on the level of choice and quality of news and content being produced by Australian journalists," said the watchdog's chairman, Rod Sims. "The ACCC goes into this inquiry with an open mind and will study how digital platforms such as Facebook and Google operate to fully understand their influence."
It comes as Facebook, used by 2 billion people a month, struggles to battle its fake news problem, which some worry may have influenced the 2016 US presidential election. In September, CEO Mark Zuckerberg disclosed that Facebook sold $100,000 worth of ads to Russian-linked accounts. Later that month, Facebook said Russian-backed content, which also includes unpaid "organic" posts, was seen by more than 126 million people on the social network.  
"While news is only a small part of the content shared on our services, we take our role in the media ecosystem very seriously and invest significantly in products that support publishers," a Facebook spokesperson said. "We look forward to a thorough inquiry into the Australian media market."
Google was contacted for comment.
Outside of quality control, the ACCC said the investigation will also explore how digital platforms are helping or hurting the media business. 
"There are growing concerns that digital platforms are affecting traditional media's ability to fund the development of content," Sims said, with the ACCC's press release pointing to the continuing trend of advertisers spending more on digital media and less on print media.   
The ACCC's preliminary report will be released in December 2018, followed by a full report in June 2019.

Technically Incorrect offers a slightly twisted take on the tech that's taken over our lives.
The words say it all.
Sexual harassment has been in the news lately.
The tech world hasn't exactly been immune from the controversy. From VC Steve Jurvetson to Pixar boss John Lasseter to, well, Uber, the accusations and departures have been swift and sudden.
But is this really some novel development?
The women of "Saturday Night Live" and host Saoirse Ronan decided to offer a little perspective.
They offered a deceptively girl-groupy ditty called "Welcome to Hell." In bubblegum overtones, they sang of the grim realities of being a woman for, oh, the last few hundred years or more.
"All these big, cool, powerful guys are turning out to be, what's the word? Habitual predators," purred Aide Bryant.
"Cat's out of the bag," said Kate McKinnon. "Women get harassed all the time."
"This been the damn world," Cecily Strong explained. 
But why the Spice Girls/Bananarama presentation? "This ain't a girl group. We just travel in a pack for safety," revealed Bryant. 
The cheery atmosphere emphasizes the sheer, everyday horror. 
And, as Leslie Jones interjected, it's even worse for women of color.
Still, some will only point to the "sad" results. 
"Now 'House of Cards' is ruined and that really sucks," mused Ronan. "Well, here's a list of stuff that's ruined for us."
Simple things like parking and walking and, yes, Uber. Everyday behaviors that, for women, may be fraught with dangers. 
It's tempting to think the recent mini-purge involving names as famous as Harvey Weinstein, Charlie Rose, Matt Lauer and Amazon Studios boss Roy Price, may bring a new atmosphere of respect.
But will anything really change? 
After all, very little has in the longest time. I wonder which way Alabama will be voting on December 12.


Technically Incorrect offers a slightly twisted take on the tech that's taken over our lives.
Not worth it?
I think of T-Mobile most often when I see it's insulted Verizon and when I see someone wear a pink tutu at a party.
Still, it's presented itself very well over the last couple of years as the carrier that thinks most about customers, especially with its push toward unlimited data.
Could it possibly be the store that would guide me toward buying the right phone?
Regular readers might know that I've been visiting various retailers to see how they present different phones to customers. You know, in person.
I've been to both a Verizon store and a Best Buy to learn about Pixel 2. In both cases, I was guided toward a Samsung Galaxy.
I went to an AT&T store, where I was told that the Galaxy Note 8 was a better phone than the iPhone X. 
What would T-Mobile tell me? 
I was moved to visit, as the carrier offered a 2-for-1 promotion on the iPhone 8 last week. 
Did this mean that T-Mobile was selling so many iPhone X's that it was desperate to get rid of the lesser upgrade from last year's phone? 
Was iPhone X the phone that would tear me away from my trusty, now slightly rusty-looking iPhone 6?
I went to a San Francisco Bay Area T-Mobile store to find out. 
It all started well enough
A sprightly salesman approached me as I looked over the iPhone range.
I showed him my iPhone 6. He didn't sneer. This was a good start. Not everyone looks so kindly on old phones in the Bay Area.
He swiftly dismissed the iPhone 8 as a minor upgrade. 
"You've got wireless charging, faster processor and you've got the glass back. But it's pretty much the same phone as the one you've got," he said.
"But wait. Don't you have a 2-for-1 promotion going on for these right now?"
"That ended Monday. We've got a 2-for-1 on the Samsungs, but not on the 8's."
Was this the moment I was going to be told Samsungs were better? Not yet, it seemed.
"Oh, so did you have the promotion because you needed to get rid of a lot of 8's?" I asked.
"No," he replied, a little too quickly. "It was just a promotion."
I then asked him about the iPhone X. He couldn't show me how Face ID works, because each phone can only work with one person's face. 
He insisted, though, that it was secure. "I think there's a million-to-one chance that someone else's face will open your phone," he said.
iPhone X? It's not worth the extra 200 bucks
Then things took a strange turn.
He suddenly volunteered that it took more time to get to all your apps on the X than it did with the iPhone 8 Plus.
"With the 8 Plus, you just double-click on the home button and, look, there they all are," he said. "With iPhone X, it's messier." He showed me how much messier, as he made several gestures to achieve the same effect.
So the future of the smartphone takes you back in time, not forward?
"A lot of people aren't buying the X because they miss the home button," he said. "Look, there's not much difference between the X and the 8 Plus. The camera's the same, the screen size is almost the same. All the iPhone people in this store upgraded to an 8 Plus, not an X."
"Why?"
"Because they didn't think the X was worth the extra 200 bucks."
I confess to being surprised. I've enjoyed the candor of all the salespeople I've talked to. But here was one who was trying to sell me what most people would tell me is a lesser phone.
"So why do people buy the iPhone X?"
"One of the biggest reasons is the animojis," he said, with something of a chuckle. These require your facial features from Face ID and animate them into, say, a unicorn or a pile of excreta. A pile of singing excreta, if you want to enjoy animoji karaoke.
"But these are just younger people, right?"
"No, all ages. It's incredible."
And the best phone is...the one that's dead
"So which phone do you think is the best?" I asked.
"For me, the Note 8," he said, without hesitation. "I had an iPhone for a while when the Note 7 thing happened. But when the Note 8 came out, I went straight back to it."
He explained that, for him, Android was better because he could "do more" with it, especially download free apps. I'd heard this from several salespeople. This one loved the Note 8's big screen.
It was then that he admitted his Note 8 had died just before Thanksgiving. "Just totally dead," he said. "I couldn't believe it."
He had a temporary phone but would be going straight back to a new Note 8 shortly, he said.
Now that was brand loyalty. And no, unlike staff in other carrier stores, he said he didn't get a work phone from T-Mobile.
"So are you saying I should get a Note 8?" I asked. "Isn't it hard to switch from iOS to Android?"
"It's simple," he replied. "We do it all here for you."
This was an incentive I hadn't heard before. But he stopped short of telling me I should go Android.
"You should stick with iPhones," he concluded, with a tinge of pity. "It's what you know." 
OK. So, finally, which iPhone?
This salesman was utterly charming, if occasionally distracted by a sudden influx of customers in the store. 
He took me over to the iPhone comparison chart to make his final pitch.
"See here. With the 8 Plus, you even get one hour's more browsing than you do with the X," he said. (This is true. 13 vs. 12.)
He could see I wasn't quite convinced.
"What it comes down to is this," he said. "If you take a lot of selfies and you like animojis, get an X. If you don't, get an 8 Plus."
He got pulled away by another customer and became so involved with that customer that I ended up leaving the store. 
And I underline, as always, that this was just one visit to one store.
On the plus side, he hadn't tried to move me over to Android, as salespeople in other stores had. On the 8 Plus side, he seemed determined that the big, but not so novel, phone was right for me.
I asked T-Mobile whether salespeople are incentivized to sell certain phones at certain times. The company declined to comment.
Was he trying to sell me the phone he thought would be best for me? Or was he trying to sell me the phone he wanted to sell me? That's the real-life customer dilemma. 
I dwelt on this for a moment, before another thought invaded: At no store has a salesperson told me the iPhone X is the best phone or even, in this case, the best iPhone. Even though my colleague Scott Stein, who knows about these things, insists it is definitely the latter.
That's a little odd, isn't it?


American says this can be you after all, this holiday season.
Talk about a sigh of relief.
American Airlines said Friday it has solved a scheduling snafu that allowed too many pilots to take off work during the December holiday season. Typically, holidays are doled out based on seniority.
"In short, if Santa is flying, so is American," the airline said in a statement.
The trouble started last week when American, one of the world's largest airlines, realized the scheduling glitch potentially left thousands of flights without a pilot during what will be a busy travel season. More than 30 million people are expected to take to the skies in the next month.
The Allied Pilots Association, which represents the airline's pilots, initially balked at the company's efforts to mitigate the problem, including using backup staff and offering pilots 150 percent of their hourly wages to work. 
American spent the past week giving updates about ongoing successes filling flights, and on Thursday it said most flights had already been staffed.
Now it appears the issue has been fully resolved. We can go back to worrying how fast the TSA lines will go.

A new ad from Apple-owned Beats, narrated by Michael K. Williams, tells you not to listen. To anyone. 
Interspersing the tales of tennis great Serena Williams, actor and singer Kris Wu, actor Michael K. Williams and soccer star Neymar, the ad suggests that to succeed you have to shut off your ears to conquer your fears.
Trolls will call you weird. But if you believe in your talents, then focus on those and rise above the noise.
It's a powerful statement. One that will upset some -- including, perhaps, the president -- as it features neither the face nor the voice, but the shirt and the fight of Colin Kaepernick.
The former San Francisco 49ers quarterback, currently without a team, has filed a collusion grievance against the NFL. He believes that the owners have blackballed him because he began to protest the treatment of black people by authorities in a simple way -- he first sat and then knelt during the National Anthem at games.
Here, Beats is holding him up as another example of someone who tries to rise above the noise, in order to achieve the aims in which he believes.
Kaepernick is so above the noise that he doesn't appear in the ad. Instead, a young black kid wears his shirt and stands up to the (literal) storm. 
It's a powerful image.  
Of course, Kaepernick has a history with Beats. He once said he was fined $100,000 for wearing the headphones instead of those of Bose, which happened to be an NFL sponsor. Now, though, he faces altogether a different kind of hissing sound.

Facebook is again in the hot seat over its ad platform.
A ProPublica investigation last October into Facebook's automated advertising platform demonstrated people could target housing advertisements to -- and away -- from specific races and ethnicities. In response, the world's largest social network said it was revamping policies and tools to prevent that from happening. 
But the social network's fix isn't working all the time, according to a report published on Thursday by ProPublica, which found Facebook is still letting discriminatory housing ads get through on its platform.
ProPublica said it bought dozens of housing ads on Facebook last week, and asked the system avoid showing them to certain audiences, including African Americans, people interested in wheelchair ramps, Jews and Spanish speakers. The report said every ad was approved by Facebook within minutes.
The groups excluded from seeing those ads are all protected under the Fair Housing Act, which prohibits people from discriminating against potential renters or buyer on the basis of "race, color, religion, sex, handicap, familial status, or national origin."
Facebook's ad policies have become a major point of scrutiny in the past year. Along with the concerns over fair housing, Facebook was also criticized because its ad platform allowed people to target automated interest categories including "Jew haters" and "why jews ruin the world."
The social network has also been in the hot seat over Russian trolls abusing it to meddle in last year's US election. Foreign agents used a combination of paid ads as well as unpaid "organic" posts to reach 126 million people on the platform. Facebook, along with rivals Google and Twitter, faced congressional hearings over the matter on Capitol Hill earlier this month.
In a statement, Ami Vora, vice president of product management at Facebook, blamed the incident on a "technical failure."
"This was a failure in our enforcement and we're disappointed that we fell short of our commitments," she wrote. "The rental housing ads purchased by ProPublica should have but did not trigger the extra review and certifications we put in place due to a technical failure."
In February, Facebook added additional safeguards to its ad platform, including more human reviewers and machine learning software, to try to stamp out abuse of its targeting tools. Vora also pointed out that the changes to the system flagged "millions" of ads that would have violated the policies.
She also said "tens of thousands" of advertisers have confirmed they are in compliance with Facebook's tighter restrictions. Right now, Facebook requires those compliance notifications from everyone who wants to post an ad for housing, employment or credit opportunities. But now Facebook will extend the requirement to all "advertisers who choose to exclude some users from seeing their ads on Facebook."
1/6 Facebook said last year it was working to identify and prevent discrimination in ads for rental housing. It appears to have failed. We @aclu are deeply disappointed. https://t.co/lAJm8IKtBg
Rachel Goodman, staff attorney for the ACLU's racial program, said in a series of tweets on Wednesday that the incident shows Facebook needs to be more transparent. 
"We're glad FB continues to express desire to get this right, but this story highlights the need for greater transparency and accountability for FB," she wrote. "Had outside researchers been able to examine the system FB created to catch these ads, they could have spotted this problem and ended the mechanism for discrimination sooner."

Reddit's home page was awash with red in protest over net neutrality.
The FCC's chief has dubbed it a "failed" attempt at "micromanaging the internet." Digital civil liberties activists call it a principle that must be upheld.
Now Reddit has weighed in on net neutrality, and its users are seeing red.
Net neutrality is the principle that all internet traffic should be treated equally and that internet service providers can't prioritize their content over competitors'. 
See also: Net neutrality repeal means your internet may never be the same
But this week, Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai revealed his plan for a full repeal of the Obama-era regulations. The move has been seen as a big win for broadband and wireless companies, but digital rights groups say it could open the door to internet providers dictating how their users access the internet.
And those internet users are getting fired up.
Reddit's homepage, the so-called "front page of the internet," was painted with crimson on Tuesday night as dozens of subreddits lit up the social network, all linking to the same thing: the pro-net neutrality website called Battle for the Net.
Backed by digital rights groups Free Press, Demand Progress and Fight for the Future, Battle for the Net gives visitors a direct link to call and lobby their members of Congress over net neutrality.
"This is your last chance to stop ISPs from messing up your Internet," the site reads.
The site has been upvoted on popular subreddits like r/books, r/NYKnicks and even r/Nascar upwards of 20,000 times each.
It's not the first time issues around net neutrality have made their way onto Reddit -- the site is often a hotbed of discussion around issues to do with regulation of technology and the internet -- but this week's move by the FCC has galvanized users.
After all, any time you mobilize book lovers and Nascar fans into the same movement, you know it must be big.

Uber's background checks face scrutiny. 
Uber is under fire again about whether its background checks are thorough enough.
Colorado regulators fined the ride-hailing company $8.9 million for allowing 57 drivers with criminal or motor vehicle offenses onto its network. One of the drivers was a convicted felon and habitual offender who used a fake name to sign up as an Uber driver, according to state officials.
"We have determined that Uber had background check information that should have disqualified these drivers under the law, but they were allowed to drive anyway," Doug Dean, director of the Colorado Public Utilities Commission, CPUC, said in a statement on Monday. "These actions put the safety of passengers in extreme jeopardy."
Uber acknowledged that some drivers who shouldn't have been allowed on its service had been approved. The company blamed the problem on an error in its background check process and has deactivated some driver accounts as part of its fix.
"This error affected a small number of drivers and we immediately took corrective action," an Uber spokeswoman said in an emailed statement. "We will continue to work closely with the CPUC to enable access to safe, reliable transportation options for all Coloradans."
Uber is one of the largest ride-hailing services on the planet, operating in 75 countries. As the company has grown, it's been criticized for allegedly letting criminals drive for it. Reports of alleged assault, rape and kidnapping by Uber drivers often make headlines.
A handful of other states, including California, Massachusetts, Maryland and Texas, have launched investigations into Uber, alleging the company routinely fails to adequately screen drivers and has hired drivers with criminal histories. At least half a dozen lawsuits have been filed against the company based on these allegations.
Colorado criminal investigators crosschecked Uber's driver records with information from the Colorado Crime Information Center and court databases. Of the 57 drivers they found, 12 had felony convictions and 17 had major moving vehicle violations, such as drunk or reckless driving. They also found 63 drivers with either a suspended, revoked or cancelled driver's license.
It's illegal in Colorado for people to commercially drive passengers if they have felony convictions, alcohol or drug-related driving offenses, unlawful sexual offenses or major moving vehicle violations. It's also required that ride-hailing companies check the backgrounds of their drivers for such offenses.
"PUC staff was able to find felony convictions that the company's background checks failed to find, demonstrating that the company's background checks are inadequate," Dean said. "In other cases, we could not confirm criminal background checks were even conducted by Uber."
The ride-hailing service uses an outside company called Checkr to do its background checks. It searches for felonies, violent crimes and sexual offenses over the past seven years. Most taxi drivers are required to have FBI fingerprint background checks.
Initially, Uber was uncooperative when the CPUC asked the company to hand over its driver records, the regulator said. In fact, a $2,500 portion of the fine against Uber is for the "failure to provide response within 72 hours of a request by an enforcement official," which is a civil penalty. 
The CPUC investigators also found evidence that at least four of the penalized drivers might still be driving for Uber, even though the company indicated that all drivers in question had been removed. 
Uber didn't respond to request for comment beyond its statement.
Colorado investigators said they conducted a similar inquiry into Lyft last year and found no violations. 
Uber can pay half of the fine within the next 10 days to resolve the case or it can contest it before an administrative law judge.

When Uber suddenly needed a new boss, HP Enterprise CEO Meg Whitman's name lit up. The former HP CEO, eBay CEO and one-time California gubernatorial candidate often seems to be on the shortlist for such things.
But no, she tweeted: "We still have a lot of work to do at HPE and I am not going anywhere."
(3/3) We have a lot of work still to do at HPE and I am not going anywhere. Uber's CEO will not be Meg Whitman.
That was four months ago. But Tuesday, HP Enterprise announced Whitman will step down from her CEO post on Feb. 1 in favor of current HPE president Antonio Neri. Neri will join the company's board of directors as well.   
While Whitman will stay on the company's board of directors, it seems like her public role has been diminshed: from CEO and chairwoman of HP, to chairwoman of HP Inc. and CEO of HP Enterprise, and now simply a member of HPE's board.
(Hewlett-Packard split into two companies in 2014: HP Inc, the company's consumer-facing computer division, and HP Enterprise, which offers servers, software and services. Whitman originally served as chairwoman of HP Inc. as well, but stepped down in July 2017.)
"Now is the right time for Antonio and a new generation of leaders to take the reins of HPE. I have tremendous confidence that they will continue to build a great company that will thrive well into the future," Whitman said in a statement.
Update, 3:30p.m. PT: On the company's earnings call, Whitman answered a follow-up question about why she's stepping down now: "[T]he next CEO of this company needs to be a deeper technologist, and that's exactly what Antonio is. He's been with the company 22 years. He is a trained computer engineer and has worked in almost every business of this company. So I just think it's the right thing."

The makers of this popular Chinese game just made it to the global tech elite club.
Remember the Chinese company that offered a helping hand to Snap? Well it just became the first in Asia to be worth more than half-a-trillion dollars.
Tencent, the owner of WhatsApp-esque WeChat in China, crossed the $500 billion mark when markets closed in Hong Kong yesterday, Bloomberg reports. It now joins global tech elites including Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Facebook and Microsoft.
The news comes less than a week after Tencent posted stellar profits of 18 billion yuan (about $2.7 billion) and 69 percent increase in overall profit year-on-year, amid rising speculation that it'll be valued over half a trillion ahead of next year.
Tencent is one of China's three top tech companies, alongside e-commerce company Alibaba and search giant Baidu, who are collectively known as BAT. The company may have become the first to achieve the milestone, but Alibaba isn't trailing far behind; it's now valued at almost $482 billion.
Tencent's exceptional growth is in part boosted by its game business, which includes popular titles League of Legends and Honour of Kings. Honour of Kings held the top spot on Apple's App Store in China for nearly a year, and caused so much concern about kids playing the game too much that Tencent had to limit playtime for those under 12. A fanatic Chinese couple went so far as to name their child after the game. Last month, the company said it would bring a version to the US called Arena of Valor.
On top of that, Tencent's WeChat continues to do well, closing in on the 1 billion user base of its foreign counterpart, WhatsApp.
CNET has reached out to Tencent for a comment.

Nigel Eccles is leaving FanDuel, the company he co-founded in 2009.
FanDuel CEO Nigel Eccles is leaving the daily fantasy sports site he co-founded in 2009, just months after the site failed to merge with rival DraftKings.
Eccles will be replaced at the second-largest daily fantasy sports site by Matt King, FanDuel's chief financial officer from 2014 to 2016, effective immediately, the company said Monday. Eccles is also leaving the company's board, where he had served as chairman.
The shake-up comes five months after FanDuel and DraftKings called off a much-discussed merger amid intense scrutiny from the Federal Trade Commission. The two companies, which control over 90 percent of the US market, agreed to join forces in November 2016.
The daily fantasy sports industry has experienced huge growth in recent years, with players spending an estimated $3.26 billion in 2016, up about 4 percent from a year earlier, according to an annual market study by Eilers & Krejcik Gaming. But that rapid growth has led to questions about how such contests, which offer cash prizes to contestants who compete in abbreviated daily versions of the traditional season-long fantasy sports leagues, might be violating state gambling laws.
As a result, DraftKings has agreed to stop accepting paid entries in nine states, while FanDuel has closed up shop in 10 states.
"Matt is the leader to capitalize on the momentum in the sports technology space to take FanDuel to the next level," Eccles said in a statement.

The tight security of Apple phones is yet again an issue in a mass shooting.
Devin Patrick Kelley walked into a tiny church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, on Nov. 5 and began firing into the Sunday service. He killed 26 people and injured another 20 in the worst mass shooting in the state's history. Investigators searching his vehicle afterward found an Apple iPhone SE covered with blood stains.
The Texas Rangers are trying to access his phone's data, and they've served Apple with a search warrant.
According to court records obtained by the San Antonio Express-News, the search warrant was granted on Nov. 9 for files stored locally on Kelley's phone, as well as any iCloud data that may exist on Apple's servers. It's unclear whether authorities have managed to retrieve any of Kelley's data yet.
Apple's policy on law enforcement requests for data is that it "will only provide content in response to a search warrant issued upon a showing of probable cause." The company previously faced conflict with the FBI over requests to unlock a phone belonging to one of the attackers in a 2015 mass shooting that killed 14 people in San Bernardino, California. Investigators were eventually able to access that phone's data without Apple's help.
An Apple spokesperson told CNET on Monday that the company does not comment on law enforcement matters but added that aside from the warrant, the company has yet to receive any request from law enforcement for technical assistance with the device.
On Nov. 8, Apple said it had contacted the FBI. "We were shocked and saddened by the violence in Texas...and we join the world in grieving for the families and community that lost so many loved ones," Apple said in a statement on Nov. 8. "Our team immediately reached out to the FBI after learning ... that investigators were trying to access a mobile phone. We offered assistance and said we would expedite our response to any legal process they send us."


Technically Incorrect offers a slightly twisted take on the tech that's taken over our lives.
Was I sold? Or unsold?
AT&T just wouldn't let go.
First, it emailed me on iPhone X preordering day: "Krzysztof, your wait for iPhone X is over." 
It wasn't. When I went online, I could order only the 64GB version. And only in silver. 
Still, AT&T persisted. On iPhone launch day, it emailed me twice. 
"Krzysztof, it's time. Order your new iPhone X online today." blared the first email, at 3:43 p.m. PT.
I didn't react. So at 11:23 that night: "Krzysztof, your new iPhone X has arrived!" 
Wait, I'd ordered it without knowing? Not quite. Still, I went online again. And again, I could order only a 64GB.
I still wasn't sure I wanted an iPhone X. I wanted to handle it a lot more, so I had an idea. Why not go along to an AT&T store and see if someone there could sell me on the phone? 
After all, I'd already been to a Verizon store and a Best Buy to see whether Pixel 2 was the perfect choice. And I've generally been fascinated by the sales process of late.
Lights. FaceID. Action.Off, then, I went to a Bay Area AT&T store. 
The minute I walked in, I was cheerily accosted by a salesman eager to help. I explained that I still had an iPhone 6 and that I was looking for a new phone life. 
I added that AT&T had been emailing me quite consistently. "Apple's probably paying them a lot of money to do that," he said with a chuckle. 
He then showed me the full range of iPhones. Yes, even the SE. He explained that the two iPhone 8 models didn't impress him much.
"What about the X?" I asked.
As in so many stores, it's hard to get a true feel of a phone when it has a security cable attached. Still, the salesman had a different approach from many phone salespeople I've encountered. They always started with the camera and how wonderful it was.
This salesman began with FaceID and how it's a much quicker way to unlock the phone.
"Have you tried it?" I asked.
"No."
"Do you have any phones in the store?" 
He explained that he didn't. Indeed, even if I decided to buy one, he wasn't sure whether I'd get it in December or January. 
"I heard that there were 2 million phones and 4 million preorders," he told me. I hadn't heard that.
So which phone is the best?He was an extremely engaging character who didn't seem entirely sold on the phone. 
I asked about the glass back and how easily it might break. He glossed over it and explained that even when people came into the store with iPhone problems -- AT&T sends people to the nearest Apple Store, of course -- none were complaining about the iPhone X.
He revealed that he was an iPhone owner, but only because he was so committed to Apple Music. I'd never heard anyone say that before.
I then asked the simplest question: "Is iPhone X the best phone I can buy?"
"Nah. The Note 8 is better," he replied, with pleasing candor. 
He explained that, for him, what was most important in a phone was the ability to watch movies for free. 
"With Android, I can download apps that let me do that. I can't do that with my iPhone," he said. "And the Note 8 has a really big screen."
"Ah, could I look at one?"
Instead of taking me over to the Samsung area of the store, he simply took one out of his pocket. It turned out to be his work phone. 
"Look," he said. "Here's the big difference. It's the screen. Samsung has been making TVs forever, yeah? So they've perfected it. This new iPhone, it's the first time they've ever done an OLED screen."
I remain fascinated and perplexedI nodded, while thinking loudly to myself, "Samsung makes the iPhone X screens, doesn't it?"
No, I didn't say it. I was far too mesmerized by the experience to interrupt its flow.
I was, as I have been though all my store visits, impressed with how open salespeople can be. He'd handed me his work phone to play with as I saw fit. He was prepared to give his honest view and even admit that he'd learned about iPhone X by trial and error.
"You don't get more commission if you sell me the Galaxy Note 8 instead of the iPhone X, do you?" I asked.
"Nah. It makes no difference what phone I sell you. We don't make money on the phones. We want to sell you the entertainment that goes on them," he said. 
He did add that very few people are moving from iPhone to Android, even though he insisted that, if you give it time, Android is the better experience.
I asked how much practice he'd had on the iPhone X before it had launched. 
"I learned on the job. At first, I didn't even know how to unlock it," he admitted. He said he'd been given a few details about the new phone beforehand, but he wouldn't characterize it as training.
AT&T didn't respond to a request for comment.
This was just one store visit, yet I heard the same story from this salesman that I'd heard from others. 
"iPhones are for people who want it simple. Androids are for people who are more nerdy. Silicon Valley -- now that's a lot more Android. Here, 90 percent of our business is iPhones," he said.
I want it simple, but I left a touch perplexed by a system that doesn't really let you thoroughly inspect a product and doesn't even provide enough products for customers to hold and enjoy. 
It seems that many people encounter the hype and buy on faith. This is the world of online shopping, after all.
When I got home, I checked my emails. AT&T had written again. No, it wasn't about the iPhone X. 
Instead, it read: "Krzysztof. The new AT&T THANKS app is your access to exclusive benefits."
AT&T wanted to thank me? Why, that's nice.
Does the Mac still matter? Apple execs explain why the MacBook Pro was over four years in the making, and why we should care.

Women in tech have stronger skills than men, according to a Brookings Institution report.
Think men's brains are better suited for tech jobs? Think again.
A report from the Metropolitan Policy Program at the Brookings Institution measured men's and women's digital scores, and found that women had stronger skills than men do.
The Brookings report, called "Digitalization and the American Workforce," looked at "information about the knowledge, skills, tools and technology; education and training; work context; and work activities required" for high tech jobs, and it gave women a digital score of 48 versus 45 for men.
But despite that higher aptitude, the report says, more men than women are filling the highest-level digital jobs in "computer, engineering and management fields, as well as lower-digital occupations such as transportation, construction, natural resources, and building and grounds occupations."
It's a familiar issue given tech's annual parade of diversity reports that show women's share of the employment pie falling below 30 percent in technical roles and thinning out even further in management and leadership positions.
"While digitalization holds out significant opportunities for less-educated or historically marginalized workers or groups to move up the employment ladder, too few of them appear to be making that progress," the report said.

The visitor center on Apple's spaceship campus has exclusive gear like tote bags, playing cards and baseball caps. 
You no longer have to be an Apple employee or journalist to visit the company's fancy new campus.
The Apple Park Visitor Center in Cupertino, California, opened to the public at 9 a.m. PT on Friday. CNET got a peek at the building an hour before dozens of Apple fans poured through the glass doors. 
Anyone who's been in a redesigned Apple Store will find the decor familiar -- long wooden tables covered with Apple gadgets like the iPhone X and tall glass walls that almost make you feel like you're outside when you're not.
A visitor to the Apple Park Visitor Center uses an AR-equipped iPad to peer inside Apple's spaceship office building. 
Along with the typical store format, this location offers a few things others don't: a cafe with the same Caffè Macs coffee Apple employees drink and a rooftop terrace that gives you a view of the spaceship office building where employees work. You can buy Apple Park schwag like T-shirts, tote bags and baseball caps, and Apple has installed a specially designed, 11,000-pound aluminum alloy model of the campus in an exhibition space. Hold an iPad in front of the model and an augmented reality app will let you peer inside the spaceship campus, fitness center or other areas of Apple Park. 
"We had people hanging off the top of the building with harnesses to use 360 cameras to photograph the landscape," Peter Russell-Clarke, an Apple industrial designer, said during a meeting with a small group of reporters. The company used drone footage to "get the light quality and colors of the landscape just right," he added. Apple also used motion capture to feature people in the buildings.
Those baseball caps? Also specially created by Apple's designers. The typical metal button at the top of the hat is missing so your Beats headphones fit more smoothly, said Enrique Atienza, the senior market director who oversees Apple's US stores. 
"This will be the only place in the world where you'll be able to find Apple Park merchandise," Atienza said during the meeting with reporters. It all "has been designed in close partnerships with the industrial design team here in Cupertino that basically works on all of our products." 
The Apple Park Visitor Center has a rooftop deck that overlooks the spaceship campus.
Apple's flashy new $5 billion campus was one of the last projects worked on by company co-founder Steve Jobs before his death in October 2011. The famously detail-oriented leader had envisioned Apple's new headquarters as a beacon of innovation and a place for the company's employees to continue their efforts to release groundbreaking products. Apple has seen its headcount balloon since its early years, and has outgrown its offices at 1 Infinite Loop, which hold about 2,800 employees. Apple Park can hold 12,000.
The new campus has custom-built door handles, thousands of trees and a 100,000-square-foot fitness and wellness facility that boasts a two-story yoga room laid out in custom distressed stone. It also has a flashy new building, called the Steve Jobs Theater, to hosts its product launches, including that of the iPhone X event in September.  
The visitor center is 18 feet tall and 200 feet long, said Ben Dobbin, an architect with Foster + Partners, the firm that worked with Apple to design the new campus. The roof structure rests on two support "stone-clad cores" to give the downstairs a more open feel and look, he said during the meeting with reporters. The glass walls with curved corners, plus 18-foot tall pivot doors that open the cafe to the outdoor terrace create "this seamless experience between inside and outside," Dobbin said. 
Those were all things people lined up to see Friday.
Sandy Porter traveled from Connecticut to support her son, who works at the Apple Park Visitor Center. "My son has wanted to do this since he was 11 years old," she said. Her favorite feature was the AR model of the campus. "The fact that we can see what goes on in there, how it looks and what they've done is amazing," Porter said. 
Marilia Guimaraes, who makes videos about Apple products, traveled from Brazil for the visitor center opening. She also attended recent store openings in Chicago and Miami. 
"I'm an Apple fan," said Guimaraes, who arrived at the visitor center two hours before it opened. "It's a beautiful store."

Ready to go to a virtual cinema without leaving your house?
Want to get out to the movies more often but don't want to deal with crowded parking, overpriced popcorn or yappy patrons Paramount Pictures might be able to help.
The movie studio is creating a virtual reality movie theater, according to Deadline.com, that will bring the experience of the theater to you. Movie fans will only have to strap on a VR headset to find themselves sitting in a movie theater with a huge projection screen in front of them.
The effort, a collaboration of Facebook's Oculus, Samsung, HTC, Microsoft and others, is yet another facet of VR's evolution and, perhaps, a new distribution channel for movie studios. Once confined to the realm of science-fiction movies like Walt Disney's "Tron," virtual reality has attracted the attention of companies large and small with promises of transporting goggle-wearing users to other environments, such as outer space or the stone age.
To kick off the VR movie theater, Paramount plans to host a showing of "Top Gun" in 3D on Dec. 3. Movie fans with VR headsets can catch the movie in 30-minute increments at Bigscreenvr.com. The experience is meant to replicate what it felt like to watch the 1986 blockbuster in the theater with other patrons.
Paramount also has plans for other movie showings in the new year, Deadline reported.
Paramount representatives didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

Denise Young Smith, Apple's head of diversity and inclusion, plans to leave the company at the end of the year. 
Apple's head of diversity and inclusion plans to leave the company after less than a year in her role. 
Denise Young Smith, the vice president who reported to CEO Tim Cook, will depart Apple at the end of the year. She was named to the newly created vice president role in May after serving as Apple's head of HR. She has worked at Apple since 1997 in a variety of roles. 
Last week, Cornell University named Young Smith its new executive-in-residence at Cornell Tech starting in January. In her new role at Cornell, Smith will "work with students to build an early career-stage awareness of inclusive leadership and diverse talent," the university said. 
Christie Smith, who spent 17 years at Deloitte and most recently served as head of human resources at cancer detection startup Grail, according to her LinkedIn profile, will replace Young Smith. Instead of reporting directly to Cook, Smith will report to Deidre O'Brien, Apple's recently appointed vice president of HR. 
"We deeply believe that diversity drives innovation," Apple said in a statement. "We're thrilled to welcome an accomplished leader like Christie Smith to help us continue the progress we've made toward a more diverse workplace."
The news comes only days after Apple released its annual diversity report. It showed some progress in hiring underrepresented minorities, but the percentage of women at the company as of July 2017 didn't change from last year's level of about a third. When it came to underrepresented minorities, Apple reported a 1 percentage point increase to 23 percent. 
Apple and other tech companies have been trying to diversify their workforce, which includes boosting the number of female and minority employees. Under CEO Tim Cook's leadership, Apple has put itself at the front of social issues like LGBT rights, racial equality and the tech industry's need to improve workforce diversity. Still, it's been difficult for Apple and its peers to show significant percentage increases in diversifying its employee base.
TechCrunch earlier reported the news.

Uber has seen at least four lawsuits regarding its drivers allegedly sexually assaulting passengers.
Uber is facing yet another lawsuit alleging one of its drivers raped and sexually assaulted a female passenger. This comes one day after a similar suit was filed against the ride-hailing company.
In this new case, lawyers for a "Jane Doe" client say the driver had a "documented history of sexual and gender-motivated violence." They say he was charged twice in 2006: once with domestic battery and another time for "annoying or molesting a child under 18." Additional charges, in 2009, resulted in a restraining order against him, the lawyers say.
"Despite his documented troubling background, Uber allowed [the driver] to transport passengers," Jeanne M. Christensen, a partner at law firm Wigdor who's representing the woman, said in an emailed statement. "Uber must take immediate action to prevent another tragedy like this from happening again."
Uber, valued at $68 billion, is one of the largest ride-hailing services on the planet, operating in about 70 countries. But with its growth, the company has come under fire for numerous allegations of drivers committing sexual assaults.
A handful of states, including California, Massachusetts, Maryland and Texas, have previously launched investigations into Uber, alleging that the company routinely fails to adequately screen drivers and has hired drivers with criminal histories. Reports of alleged sexual assaults by Uber drivers make news headlines several times a month. At least four lawsuits have been filed against the company for these allegations.
On Tuesday, Wigdor filed another lawsuit against Uber on behalf of two women who are seeking class-action status for the case on behalf of all "female riders that have experienced rape, sexual assault or gender-motivated harassment at the hands of their Uber drivers." The complaint says the #MeToo campaign, in which people told personal stories on social media of being sexually harassed and assaulted, showed how many women have reportedly experienced misconduct by Uber drivers.
Uber says it takes these allegations seriously. On its website it says it's "dedicated to keeping people safe on the road" and that its technology "enables us to focus on rider safety before, during and after every trip." 
The newest lawsuit was filed in California Superior Court on Wednesday. The "Jane Doe" alleges her Uber driver raped her during a ride home in Long Beach, California, in November 2016. According to the suit, the woman was intoxicated and had blacked out in the back of his car. She woke up to her driver reportedly on top of her ripping off her clothes. He allegedly assaulted her and then drove her home. The next morning, hospital doctors confirmed the woman had been raped, according to court documents.
It's unclear if Uber's background checks discovered the driver's past history. The ride-hailing service uses a third party company called Checkr to do its background checks, and the searches for felonies, violent crimes and sexual offenses go back for only the past seven years.
Uber said it has permanently removed this driver from its app. "These accusations are extremely concerning," an Uber spokeswoman said. "We are in the process of reviewing the lawsuit."

They're going to take over our gym membership now too?
Just in time for the holidays, the researchers at Boston Dynamics published a new video showing that robots won't just be taking over our jobs. It turns out the team's Atlas "humanoid" robot, which measures roughly 5 feet tall and weighs 165 lbs, can jump onto boxes and do backflips way better than I ever will.
"Atlas' ability to balance while performing tasks allows it to work in a large volume while occupying only a small footprint," the company says on its site. 
This is just the latest step toward eventual robot domination of our jobs, of course. Robots until now have been largely relegated to manufacturing and industrial work, but analysts say that's just the start. While experts say the very idea of Arnold Schwarzenegger look-a-likes chasing after us isn't realistic, it is clear robots are inching (or jumping, in this case) ever closer to what we humans can do. 
Boston Dynamics in particular has become popular for posting YouTube videos showing off what its robots can do. 
Just a couple days ago, the company posted a video of its creepy robot dog running outside. In the past, the company has shown other prototypes doing various tricks, and even falling over.
The company, which used to be owned by Google parent company Alphabet, didn't immediately respond to a request for comment about what these new capabilities mean for Atlas specifically. But it's likely that being more nimble means the robot may be able to work in rougher terrain.
No word on whether owning an Atlas would count toward my CrossFit goals though.

It's Complicated: This is dating in the age of apps. Having fun yet?


With technology increasingly intertwined with all aspects of business, CNET@Work can help you -- from prosumers to small businesses with fewer than five employees -- get started.
For malicious hackers, startups and small businesses equal big targets of opportunity.
Half of the 28 million small businesses in the US suffered data breaches in the last year. But many still remain unprepared. About one in three small businesses still don't have basic cybersecurity protections in place, such as firewalls, antivirus software, spam filters and data-encryption tools to defend against attacks that can derail their operations.
While it's hard to measure the return on investment for cybersecurity compared with spending money on sales or manufacturing, be aware that the potential losses resulting from a cybersecurity breach can sink a company by exposing trade secrets, valuable IP and information. 
At the same time, you risk losing your customers' trust as well as souring chances to win their future business. In addition, you may be found legally liable if a security breach winds up compromising customer data. 
And don't assume you can fly under the radar. Startups are incredibly vulnerable to cyberattacks in their first 18 months.
Many companies outsource the job to the many managed security service providers (MSSPs) who specialize in cybersecurity. The downside is that this sort of arrangement can prove costly, especially for a very small operation. What's more, small business owners might be uneasy placing the security of their business operations in the hands of an outsider.
Still, protection doesn't need to turn into a budget-busting proposition and there are proactive steps you can take to mitigate threats in a cost-effective fashion. Here are several low-cost steps to help construct an effective cyberdefense while also managing everything in-house.
Prioritize what's important to you and pull together a list ranking the importance of your assets in descending order. Choose the battles you want to fight based on the risk to your business and the cost. Not all data is created equal and this will help you smartly allocate resources as you build a set of policies and controls around your most critical data.
Audit your computing infrastructure and make sure that important network devices, including routers, switches, firewalls and servers, only perform the specific functions they were acquired to perform. For example, if a Windows server isn't serving a website, it likely doesn't need IIS up and running. Also, you can use Nmap and other open source scanning tools to check whether you've left any unexpected ports open.  
Regularly scan for vulnerabilities. You can find a wide selection of free or inexpensive open source software and other services. Vulnerability scanners such as OpenVAS, network mapping tools (Nmap) -- and even an Intrusion Detection System called Snort – are all available at no cost. One thing to keep in mind: Despite the fact that these products are free, you'll still need a certain level of expertise to implement and manage these systems in an ongoing fashion.
Secure your email with a good spam filter since most attacks originate via email.
Apply security policies: Deny USB file storage, set user screen timeouts, limit user access and adhere to enhanced password policies.
Use the full range of security features and capabilities available in your existing hardware and software. For instance, Windows Firewall is included with every Windows server. While it should not be your only firewall in the network, it can still provide another barrier in a layered defense. Best of all, it doesn't cost any extra.
Are you patching servers consistently? Too many organizations are lax about keeping up when software suppliers issue regular free updates to their products.
Patching also applies to hardware devices. Keeping current when manufacturers issue the newest firmware with fixes and other improvements to hardware will help improve the security of your firewall, switches and Wi-Fi access points.
Check your equipment configurations to minimize the attack surface on any device. This is especially critical for any external-facing components. Turn off any features that you don't need.
Take out cyberinsurance so there's coverage for business disruption expenses, including PR and legal expertise to deal with any fallout from a breach. This helps ensure proper legal protocols get followed and that affected people can be properly informed about the situation.
And lastly, raise employee awareness about cybersecurity. This doesn't cost a thing and it will pay back your time investment many times over. Enlist employees as an extension of the existing security program. Everyone on staff needs to shoulder responsibility for the security of the organization. There's no excuse for bad cybersecurity etiquette, not with intruders trying to break into your company more frequently than ever.

Some might argue that training is less important than investing in technology. But if you work on the assumption that employees are always bound to do the wrong thing, they will. 
Make sure they are aware of the potential security threats facing the organization and also know how to recognize phishing emails or social engineering attempts. Put specific policies in place so employees will know what constitutes appropriate use of business equipment. Also, make it easy to report any irregular or suspicious behavior.  
Whichever direction you choose, the goal is the same: Build out a multilayer defense that is going to protect your organization as much as possible and help mitigate the threats. 
If it sounds too daunting to take on, think about the consequences of doing nothing. The bad guys will be coming for you -- sooner or later. You'll help both your reputation and bottom line by being prepared.


Accomable is a site that works like Airbnb, except it caters specifically to people with disabilities.
Airbnb is looking to make things easier for travelers who are disabled.
The lodging-rental company said Thursday that it's rolling out new features for disabled travelers and has bought a business called Accomable.
Accomable is a startup founded in 2015 by two friends with spinal muscular atrophy, a rare neuromuscular disorder that can confine people to wheelchairs. After traveling the world and seeing how difficult it was to find places to stay, they founded Accomable. The startup works similarly to Airbnb in that it's a platform for short-term rentals; the main difference is it caters specifically to people with disabilities.
"Accomable started less as a company or a product but more as a mission and a dream," Srin Madipalli, Accomable CEO and co-founder, wrote in a blog post Wednesday. "A mission to open up travel and adventure to hundreds of millions of disabled people; and a dream that one day, I, as a disabled person could travel the world just like everybody else."
For Airbnb, Accomable seemed like an ideal fit. Airbnb had already been meeting with disability advocacy groups to see how it could make travel more accessible. Along with acquiring Accomable, Airbnb has also added new "accessibility needs" features to its site, such as a checklist for hosts to say whether they have step-free entry to rooms and doorways wide enough to accommodate wheelchairs.
"The features help hosts be descriptive about their home's accessibility, and give guests the clear information they need to find the right home for them," Airbnb wrote in a blog post.
In just under a decade, Airbnb has gone from a small startup catering to couch surfers to a billion-dollar business with a massive online presence. It lists roughly 4 million homes for rent in 191 countries -- that's almost every country on earth. As it has grown, it's worked to be more inclusive.
Airbnb's rules already prohibit any type of discrimination against people with disabilities, but the company wanted to do more. Before now travelers with disabilities only had the option of searching for home rentals labeled as "wheelchair accessible." But that's changing.
Over the next few months, Accomable's listings will be migrated to Airbnb and the startup's website will be shuttered. On Airbnb's site, these listings will have step-free access info, detailed photos, and details on a home's accessibility. Airbnb is also working to redesign its text and improve color contrast on its site to make it easier for visually impaired people to read it.
"All of these improvements are important, but they alone aren't the solution," said Airbnb. "They are the start of an ongoing conversation and we're committed to doing more."

Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg is among the tech CEOs facing mounting pressure to increase protections against fake news stories. 
After more than a year of being pilloried for their services spreading hoax news, tech giants Google, Facebook, Twitter and Microsoft's Bing have signed up to a new program that identifies articles from "trusted" news sources. 
The initiative, spearheaded by a journalism ethics enterprise called the Trust Project, is being implemented by media companies comprising dozens of news sites. These publishers add indicators to their articles and site coding that clarifies the organizations' journalistic standards, writers' backgrounds and how they do their work. 
The indicators also show what type of information people are reading – news, opinion, analysis or advertising.
It's up to the tech companies, however, how they decide to utilize these "trusted-source" indicators. The Trust Project said Google, Facebook, Bing and Twitter have all agreed to use the indicators and they are "investigating and piloting ideas" about how to use them "to surface and display quality journalism."
The Washington Post, The Economist, Mic, The Globe and Mail, the Independent Journal Review, Italy's La Repubblica and La Stampa, Trinity Mirror and the German press agency dpa are among the companies starting with Trust Indicators this month. 


Brave Software's logo
Brave Software on Thursday released a new version of its browser that lets you donate money directly to YouTube stars.
The free browser blocks ads by default but lets you distribute money anonymously to websites each month, giving more money to the websites you visit more often and letting you "pin" favorites you always want to fund. Now Brave lets you do the same with YouTubers -- at least for those creators who sign up to receive the money.
For now, that money is whatever you transfer from your own bank account to a Brave electronic wallet. Next year, though, Brave plans to start funding the activity with revenue generated by online ads it'll show if you choose to see them, said Brave co-founder and Chief Executive Brendan Eich, who previously led Mozilla's Firefox browser effort.
Initially, Brave will show ads in a separate browser tab, with 70 percent of revenue going to you, if you're using Brave and have opted in. But the company also plans to place ads in partnership with website publishers, in which case 70 percent of the revenue goes to the publisher, 15 percent to you and the rest to Brave and its advertising business partners.
It's all part of Brave's attempt to rewrite the rules of online advertising. Today's online ads are often supplied by a witches' brew of advertising intermediaries that Brave wants to supplant with a system that keeps your online behavior data private. Brave -- the browser, not the company -- will monitor your browsing activity to better target ads toward your interests, but will share only ad-related keywords that aren't linked to your own identity.
Brave's payment system now can direct money to YouTube creators
YouTube has become a profitable for some, but it's not easy even for people who have something interesting to share online. YouTube restricted ads for YouTubers with fewer than 10,000 video views in March in an effort to curtail some problems. Alternatives such as Patreon let you fund creative types, but Brave hopes to make the process automatic once you set up its general payment system.
Companies like Facebook, Twitter and YouTube rely on others to generate the content that makes their platforms compelling. That's why Brave by default doesn't send money their way and why Brave aimed to pay YouTubers, not YouTube.
"There's been exploitation, and those platform owners are the biggest companies on the planet," Eich  said.
Brave has started contacting YouTube stars and hopes they'll sign up and publicize Brave's approach, he said.
The payment mechanism relies on a cryptocurrency -- initially bitcoin when Brave started testing the system 14 months ago, but now the infrastructure of a rival project called Ethereum.
Brave's payment system now can direct money to YouTube creators
Neither you nor YouTubers have to worry about the computer-science particulars, though. Brave has a partnership with a company called Uphold that converts ordinary money into and out of the quasi-currency Brave is trying to establish for the online advertising market, the Basic Attention Token or BAT.
It's tough to challenge the big names in browsers -- Google, Microsoft, Apple and Mozilla. Brave has made some headway, though, Eich said. Brave has more than 1 million downloads so far on Android, iOS, Windows, MacOS and Linux, and Eich said about a million people use the browser each month.

Amazon will work with the popular food website Allrecipes to link recipe ingredients directly to AmazonFresh, the online retailer's grocery delivery service, the companies announced Thursday. 
This integration will let send all of the ingredients and products you need for a recipe to an AmazonFresh shopping cart, where you can then order the groceries and have them delivered to your house (as long as you live in one of the areas in which the service is available). 
"We want grocery shopping to be as seamless and convenient as possible for customers, and this integration makes it easier than ever for them to shop for all the ingredients needed for new or fan-favorite recipes," an Amazon spokesperson said in a statement. This is one of the first sites with which AmazonFresh has integrated. The company will also collaborate with Eat Love, a company that provides personalized meal plans and recipes based on your dietary needs.
The partnership appears to be another way for Amazon to integrate itself into your cooking life. This year, Amazon bought the high-end Whole Foods Market chain in an aggressive move into the grocery market. Shortly after that announcement, Amazon reportedly notified customers in parts of Pennsylvania and New Jersey that their AmazonFresh deliveries will stop after Nov. 30. 
It's fair to speculate that Amazon will eventually integrate Whole Foods' brick-and-mortar location with its home grocery delivery, especially to reach even a sliver of the 80 million users who use Allrecipes.

A lone Bluegogo bike can be seen, surrounded by its Mobike and Ofo competition on the streets of Beijing.
Bike sharing in China is about to change, as the country's third largest service appears to be on rocky grounds.
Bluegogo is reported to have funding issues and some employees in its main offices have been cut.
Reporters from Chinese publication The Paper visited an empty office in Beijing and found out that the company owed 2 million yuan ($300,000) in office rental. The company, which had raised 600 million yuan ($90 million) and has 700,000 bicycles, appears to also be unable to refund deposits, according to online chatter on China's version of Twitter, Weibo. 
With Bluegogo's death apparently imminent, its two larger rivals will dominate the landscape to come. Ofo, which is backed by Alibaba, and Mobike, backed by Tencent, are said to be in talks for a merger with China's Uber, Didi. This will let them raise prices as well as cut back on bikes to become profitable.
Besides dominating China, both Ofo and Mobike have ventured to other countries in the world. They can be found in the UK (Manchester), Italy, Australia (Sydney), Singapore and the US (Seattle). Bluegogo remains rooted in China, though it did briefly launch in San Francisco.

Technically Incorrect offers a slightly twisted take on the tech that's taken over our lives.
That's how I used to look. Well, not the blonde hair.
I've never wanted to put all my eggs into Google's basket.
I don't know what Google wants to use that basket for -- and I have suspicions that it's not all good -- so I try and use competing products as much as I can. 
This has meant having, oh, a Hotmail account. (I know, I know.) And using several browsers, with Firefox being the principal one.
I'm moved by the Mozilla mission to make the web "open and accessible to all," courtesy of a non-profit organization. Well, more than I'm moved by Google's mission, which seems to encompass being a very for-profit organization.
Using Firefox has, though, not been without pain. It froze more often than a nerd on his first date. And it was as zippy as Mark Zuckerberg's wit.
Now, however, there's a new Firefox browser called Quantum. My colleague Stephen Shankland has been testing it for a while and says I should believe Mozilla's promises for a brighter, faster future.
To go with the launch, Mozilla has released an ad. I want to believe in that too.
The ad promises that Quantum will end your "wait face."
It shows a series of people who are waiting for pages to load and streams to stream. These people don't have happy faces. They're not getting what they want right now.
This is America, after all.
As I watched this ad, only one thought occurred to me: "I used to look like that when I used old Firefox. Mozilla is admitting that old Firefox drove you nuts. How charming."
This was remarkably open and accessible honesty. Or, at least, so it seemed to me.
Just to be sure, though, I contacted Mozilla and asked: "Are you criticizing your old product?"
Chief marketing officer Jascha Kaykas-Wolff told me: "Wait Face is all about the general frustration of slowness on the  internet and how Firefox Quantum is the antidote to that. It's fast  because it's built for modern devices and the way people today need  their browser to perform."
Well, that was diplomatic.
Still, I'm going to try it. And I'll see if I can return to writing this column via Firefox. (It's brought to you currently by Chrome.)
If I can, you understand, it will make me feel I'm a better person. A slightly better person from a very low base, that is.

Twitter made good Wednesday on threats it would begin stripping its verification badge from accounts found to have crossed the line as the social network continues to review the process it uses to hand out the coveted blue check marks.
Twitter has long offered the badge to authenticate accounts that are of interest to the public. Such accounts have typically included those of public figures and organizations in entertainment, politics, business, sports and the media. But the company has recently begun to worry that the badges also conveyed an endorsement of the account by Twitter.
"Verification has long been perceived as an endorsement," the company tweeted Wednesday. "We gave verified accounts visual prominence on the service, which deepened this perception. We should have addressed this earlier but did not prioritize the work as we should have."
Twitter said it will remove the verification badges from accounts whose behavior does not fit their guidelines.
Twitter removed on Wednesday badges from two accounts associated with white nationalists. Richard Spencer, who advocates a separate white homeland, and Jason Kessler, the organizer of the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, lost their badges Wednesday afternoon. The August rally in Charlottesville turned violent as neo-Nazis clashed with protesters, leaving one person dead and dozens injured. 
Twitter suspended its verification process last week after the social network drew widespread outrage for giving the verification badge to Kessler's account.
Spencer and Kessler didn't immediately respond to requests for comment, but Spencer responded to the action in a tweet that said: "Verified no more! Is it not okay to be proudly White?"
Verified no more! Is it not okay to be  proudly White? 🤷🏻‍♂️
Kessler tweeted that Twitter "has changed their verification policy just to be able to censor me."
Twitter has changed their verification policy just to be able to censor me. Several other accounts were unverified including Richard Spencer and James Allsup while Baked Alaska was permanently suspended altogether. pic.twitter.com/PO1QnJC2C6
Twitter also suspended the account of alt-right troll Tim Gionet, better known by his Twitter handle @BakedAlaska. Gionet began trending worldwide and later ranted about his Twitter ban on YouTube. 
Twitter didn't immediately respond to a request for further comment.
The removals came as Twitter provided an update in a series of tweets about its suspended verification process. Twitter said it's working on a new authentication and verification program and still not accepting any new requests. 
"We should've communicated faster on this (yesterday). Our agents have been following our verification policy correctly, but we realized some time ago the system is broken and needs to be reconsidered," Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey tweeted last week. "And we failed by not doing anything about it. Working now to fix faster."
According to the social network's rules, a verified account can lose its status on the grounds of promoting hate, violent behavior or harassment, as well as posting gruesome images.
Twitter isn't the only internet company to crack down on far right speech. The Daily Stormer, a neo-Nazi website, has bounced around domains since GoDaddy pulled its registration shortly after the Virginia rally. Cloudflare, which protects websites from denial-of-service attacks, also dropped the site. 
The moves were met with a mixed response. The Electronic Frontier Foundation criticized the decision by tech companies to revoke their services, saying the same tactic could be used to prevent other organizations, such as civil rights groups, from expressing themselves.

Technically Incorrect offers a slightly twisted take on the tech that's taken over our lives.
Elon Musk, in not a black turtleneck.
If I asked you to describe Elon Musk's dress sense, what would you say? 
Slightly cool, shabby LA film star sort of thing? Certainly, the Tesla CEO doesn't have a uniform, as some tech CEOs surely have. 
Who can ignore Mark Zuckerberg's t-shirts? Then there was Steve Jobs's black turtlenecks, about which Musk has very strong feelings.
In a revealing and sometimes emotional interview with Rolling Stone published Wednesday, Musk explained how much he disliked being portrayed as the new Steve Jobs.
"If I was dying and I had a turtleneck on, with my last  dying breath I would take the turtleneck off and try to throw it as far  away from my body as possible," he said.
Apple didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.
It is, though, a very bad habit for people to desperately want a new version of something that came before. It's as if the human imagination needs to be soothed, rather the excited. Reassured, rather than revolutionized.
Musk is surely not a second anyone. He has his own way of going about things and, indeed, his own fears and dreams. In this interview, he reiterated his extreme fears for the dangers of artificial intelligence.
"Climate change is the biggest threat that humanity faces this century,  except for AI," he said. "I keep telling people this." 
He insisted his views were those of everyone in the scientific community. Save for those he deems crazy, that is.
He worries that Google, Facebook and Amazon (and "arguably Apple, but they seem to care about privacy") represent an enormous, unsupervised risk when it comes to the depth of information they hold over everyone and what they might do with it. 
Musk is one of the backers (along with, oh, Facebook board member Peter Thiel) of OpenAI, an organization that seeks to ensure that AI doesn't become a force for evil.
Musk, though, is not your average loner. He admitted that he can't bear to be alone and can't be happy unless he's in a serious relationship. "Going to sleep alone drives me crazy," he said. 
The interview was conducted just after he'd broken up with someone -- reportedly actress Amber Heard. "Well, she broke up with me more than I broke up with her, I think," he revealed.
Musk comes across in the interview as a very emotional man. 
In the past, he's admitted to perhaps being bipolar and has said he experiences great highs and terrible lows.
Though he may not share Jobs's sartorial instincts, there are similarities between the two. He told Rolling Stone that an end goal for his products is that they should enjoy aesthetic beauty. 
Does this mean turtlenecks aren't beautiful?

Aqua Connect and its wholly owned subsidiary claim that Apple is using their technology without permission.
The US International Trade Commission is putting Apple under the microscope again.
The commission, which is already investigating complaints against Apple over its legal spat with Qualcomm, said Tuesday that it's investigating a patent infringement dispute related to a lawsuit filed by Aqua Connect and its wholly owned subsidiary Strategic Technology Partners. Aqua Connect is a Nevada company but has its headquarters in Orange, California.
The companies claim that Apple is using patented designs without permission to build screen-sharing and remote desktop server features for Macs, iPods, iPhones, iPads and Apple TV. They filed the complaint on October 10 in US District Court for the Central District of  California.
Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
"Initially, our product had Apple's full support. But years later, Apple built our technology into its macOS and iOS operating systems without our permission," Ronnie Exley, Aqua Connect's CEO, said in a statement. Aqua Connect said it wants Apple to stop using its technology in devices.
The commission has the power to ban products from entering the US, which is often enough of a threat that companies will settle their issues out of court. 


An artist's rendering of Arrivo tubes in Denver.
It may not be Hyperloop, but Denver residents may one day find themselves shuttled around Denver in tubes at speeds of up to 200 mph.
That is the promise of a partnership announced Tuesday between Arrivo, a Los Angeles-based transportation startup led by a former executive and co-founder of Hyperloop One, and the Colorado Department of Transportation. The partnership aims to create a series of enclosed superhighways that use magnetic levitation and electric power to whisk floating vehicles around the heart of the congested city.
Arrivo, Italian for "arrival," was co-founded earlier this year by Brogan BamBrogan, once the chief technology officer at Hyperloop One. BamBrogan resigned from Hyperloop in July 2016 and filed a lawsuit accusing company executives of defamation, breach of fiduciary duty and assault, in which a noose was placed around his chair.
The lawsuit was settled in November 2016 for an undisclosed amount, and now BamBrogan is focused on building a $15 million test center and test track in the Denver Metro area.
"Passengers and cargo arrive quickly and efficiently at extremely low cost," BamBrogan said in a statement that likened the system to the one being built by his former company. "Arrivo will end traffic and futureproof regional mobility."
But unlike Hyperloop, which promises to move passengers and cargo over long distances through vacuum-sealed tubes at speeds up to 700 mph, Arrivo will move people much shorter distances at a fraction of the speed. Still passengers can expect to get around Denver much quicker than possible today, making what is normally an hour-long rush hour trip between Denver and Boulder in just 8 minutes.
"We are reaching max roads in many cases in Colorado," Shailen Bhatt, executive director of the Colorado Department of Transportation, said in a statement. "Arrivo has a unique and practical approach to implementing hyperloop technology to eliminate traffic and dramatically improve the way people and goods move around the city."
Arrivo expects the test track to be completed by 2021.

Editor's note Nov. 15: LinkedIn said Tuesday its career advice featur is now broadly available. The social network originally announced the update in August. Our coverage of that announcement, which contains more details on the update, follows.
Looking for work on LinkedIn? You'll soon find something else, too -- career advice from recommended mentors.
It's a feature that's currently being tested internally, LinkedIn said. When it arrives in the coming weeks, users will be able to list their preferences on the type of advice they're looking for and the kind of mentor they'd like to meet -- someone in a certain area or industry, for instance. From there, LinkedIn will play matchmaker and connect you with any willing mentors that meet your criteria. Mentors can also filter out potential mentees based on criteria like area, industry, and alma mater.
"This is a lightweight way to identify and connect with other members," a LinkedIn spokesperson tells CNET, "and it works well with the informal, casual nature of today's changing workforce." 
The larger goal may be to drive job-seekers toward LinkedIn's "ProFinder" service, which lets users hire professional freelancers, including for job-hunting and career counseling purposes.  
There's some clear appeal here for job-hunters in need of tailored advice on things like interviews and salary negotiations -- what's less clear is how LinkedIn plans to attract qualified mentor figures to serve as pro bono career counselors for strangers on the internet, or if LinkedIn has any mechanism in place for vetting these mentors.
"Giving back is a strong force for mentors," a LinkedIn spokesperson says. "We're finding that people want to pay it forward. We've found in our initial research that 89% of senior leaders currently give or would be interested in giving advice."


Wednesday morning was big for Australia. The country's Same Sex Marriage survey result was announced, with a 61 percent vote in favour of same-sex marriage.
Apple CEO Tim Cook congratulated Australia on the vote, tweeting that it was "another important step toward equality for all." His faux pas? Cook then added an emoji of the New Zealand flag.

Congratulations Australia! Another important step toward equality for all. 🇦🇺 #MarriageEquality
He quickly deleted his original tweet, and uploaded a new one with the correct flag. On one hand, the flags look almost identical to the untrained eye. On the other, Australians are all trained to see that difference, and consider the mixup a slight on our sovereignty.
The Australian Bureau of Statistics said 61.6 percent of survey voters gave a tick to marriage equality, though the result, unlike a referendum, is nonbinding. Following the result, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said it was now Parliament's job "to get on with it and get this [legislated] before Christmas."
Cook is no stranger to voicing his opinion on public matters. Coming out as gay in 2014, he's often vocal on matters of diversity and inclusion, and has also pledged to make Apple a greener and more charitable company.

Tech companies are still not doing enough to stop kids from working in cobalt mines in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, according to international human rights organization Amnesty International.
While tech giants including Apple, Samsung and Dell are making some progress, more needs to be done to stop children as young as 7 years old from working in "horrendous" and in some cases deadly conditions, the organization said in a report released Tuesday.
Apple executives Ashley Orbach and Amy Chan, left, listen to Amnesty International secretary general Salil Shetty's plea to end child cobalt mining in the Congo.  
Those steps include companies asking their suppliers to trace where the cobalt comes from, Seema Joshi, Amnesty's head of business and human rights, told a group of tech and auto company leaders attending a roundtable discussion on the matter in San Francisco. 
"When you look at the leaders of these companies, they're still not disclosing this critical information needed to evaluate what they're doing is actually effective in identifying and protecting human rights abuses," Joshi said. "Were children involved in collecting cobalt? We know the problem still exists."
Cobalt is important for the lithium-ion batteries found in phones, laptops and tablets. About 60 percent of the world's cobalt supply comes from the Congo, and about 20 percent of it is mined by hand, said the organization, which first called attention to problems in a January 2016 report.
Amnesty's latest report commended Apple for being the first company to publish the names of its cobalt suppliers and dubbed it the industry leader in responsible cobalt sourcing. The tech giant is working closely with China-based cobalt supplier Huayou Cobalt to address child labor in its supply chain.
"We're proud of the progress we've made and we know our work is never done," Apple said in a statement Tuesday. "We will continue to drive our standards throughout our supply chain and do all that we can to ensure that everyone is treated with the dignity and respect they deserve."
Apple began investigating risks surrounding cobalt in late 2014 and in 2015 began mapping its cobalt supply chain down to the mine level, it said in its 2017 supplier responsibility report. In March, Apple said it would stop buying cobalt mined by hand in the Congo following reports of child labor and dangerous work conditions.
Apple has been focused for years on making its products and its operations more environmentally friendly. The company aims to one day run on all renewable energy, as well as get its suppliers to do the same.
Apple said in its 2017 environmental responsibility report, released in April, that as of 2016, it powered 96 percent of its operations around the world with 100 percent renewable energy, like solar, hydro and wind power. In 24 countries where it operates, Apple has reached the 100 percent renewable level, and nearly 100 percent of the paper used in product packaging is from recycled or "responsibly managed sources." Still, the company acknowledges more can be done.
That sentiment was shared by Kelly Liu, a supply chain manager at Dell. She said her company has been working closely with Huayou Cobalt and conducted a survey with its suppliers and shared its template with other companies as well.
"We recognize this is a complex issue, and this is probably going to be marathon and not a sprint in order to create positive change," she said.
Salil Shetty, Amnesty's secretary general, told the participants that they have a long way to go to stop child mining abuses in the Congo.
"We don't have much time because as we are speaking, they are digging," he said. "We have to find solutions now."


Uber has been hit with at least three lawsuits alleging its drivers sexually assaulted passengers.
Another lawsuit alleging rape has been filed against Uber.
This time the complaint comes from two women seeking class-action status for the suit on behalf of all "female riders that have experienced rape, sexual assault or gender-motivated harassment at the hands of their Uber drivers." The two women are remaining anonymous.
"Uber must make drastic changes to prevent another female rider from harm," Jeanne M. Christensen, a partner at law firm Wigdor LLP who's representing the women, said in an email. "As alleged, the recent #MeToo campaign has exposed the heinous acts that female riders have been forced to endure during Uber rides."
The #MeToo campaign, which gained steam on Facebook and Twitter last month, was a way for people who've faced sexual assault or harassment to share their experiences and show the magnitude of the problem. Hundreds of people spoke out against Uber on social media sites, saying they'd been harassed by drivers. Female drivers also said they'd experienced sexual harassment by passengers.

Uber, valued at $68 billion, is one of the largest ride-hailing services on the planet, operating in about 70 countries. But with its growth, the company has come under fire for numerous allegations of drivers committing sexual assaults.
A handful of states, including California, Massachusetts and Texas, have previously launched investigations into Uber, claiming it routinely fails to adequately screen drivers and has hired drivers with criminal histories. Reports of alleged sexual assaults by Uber drivers make news headlines several times a month.
At least three lawsuits have been filed against the company for these allegations, including a separate complaint brought by Wigdor LLP on behalf of two other "Jane Does" in 2015. Uber settled that suit in November 2016. Another lawsuit was brought in 2015 by a women who was raped by an Uber driver in India. Uber also settled that suit, but the issue was reignited last spring after it was alleged that Uber executives obtained and mishandled her medical records.
Uber's website says the company is "dedicated to keeping people safe on the road" and that its technology "enables us to focus on rider safety before, during and after every trip." 
Regarding the new lawsuit, a company spokeswoman said, "Uber received this complaint today and we are in the process of reviewing it. These allegations are important to us and we take them very seriously." 
Uber has been beleaguered by dozens of issues over the last year. Those kicked off with a #DeleteUber movement in January, then moved onto workplace sexual harassment allegations and an internal investigation led by former US Attorney General Eric Holder. In June, Uber's board of directors forced CEO Travis Kalanick to resign.
Now Uber is trying to turn things around with new CEO Dara Khosrowshahi. Last week, Khosrowshahi wrote a LinkedIn blog post about Uber's "new cultural norms" saying what made the company successful won't get it to the next level. One of his eight new cultural norms is, "We do the right thing. Period."
The new lawsuit against Uber was filed in California's US District Court for the Northern District. The two women say their Uber drivers assaulted them in two separate incidents, according to court documents.
One woman, who lives in Florida, alleges her Uber driver took her home and raped her in October 2016. The other woman, who lives in Los Angeles, alleges an Uber driver assaulted her while she was asleep in the backseat of his car and then took her home and raped her. In both instances the women were intoxicated.
The two women say Uber's background checks are inadequate and the company has misrepresented how safe the service actually is. The lawsuit is asking the court to force Uber to change the way it screens drivers and be more transparent about what it knows in regard to alleged sexual assaults by its drivers.
"The company must come forward with information about how many reports it has received about rapes, sexual assaults and gender-motivated harassment to allow consumers to assess whether Uber really does provide safe rides, especially to women," Christensen said in an email. "It is time for Uber to 'Do the right thing. Period.'"

The tech giant plans to cut its carbon emissions 75 percent by 2030, Microsoft's president and chief legal officer, Brad Smith, said in a blog post Tuesday.
"As a global company, the changes we make in how we operate our business and the goals we set have a worldwide impact," Smith said.
A Microsoft spokesperson said via email that the company has a benchmark of being carbon neutral every year. "We're also on track to meet our 50 percent renewable energy commitment by 2018 and will keep improving from there," the spokesperson said. In addition, in early November, Microsoft announced all its owned data centers will reach a LEED Gold certification for sustainability. 
Smith also said that through continued use of renewable energy and energy efficiency, Microsoft will be able to help meet the goals set by the Paris climate agreement, and "help avoid more than 10 million metric tons of carbon emissions by 2030."

An activist is trying to sue Facebook for about 12.5 million euros, or $14.7 million.
A senior adviser for the European Union's top court told an Austrian privacy activist on Tuesday that he can't sue Facebook on behalf of 25,000 people.
The adviser said that activist Max Schrems could sue the company on his own but that a class action suit would likely fall flat in court.
Schrems has accused the social network of violating European privacy laws, taking aim at what he sees as invalid privacy policies and data-sharing agreements the company has with US intelligence agencies.
A run-in with Facebook is nothing new for the activist, who was responsible for bringing the case that resulted in the EU's highest court declaring in 2015 that Safe Harbor, the US-Europe data-sharing pact, was illegal.
He is now trying to sue the company's Irish division in Austrian court, not only for violating his own privacy, but the privacy of about 25,000 signatories who live in Austria, Germany and India. His hope is to claim 500 euros ($576) in damages for each of them, or about $12.5 million euros.
Schrems' chances of succeeding are slim, EU Court of Justice Advocate General Michal Bobek said Tuesday in his decision. Bobek was asked to assess Schrems' case by the Supreme Court in Austria. His opinion is not binding, but is generally followed. His concern is that a case like this could lead Facebook users to choose to sue the company in the EU country with the most favorable court.
Schrems responded to Bobek in a statement, noting that because EU laws allow citizens to move home countries any time they choose, their home court can change just as easily. "It seems that Facebook has managed to score with their emotional horror stories, according to which collective actions by consumers are highly questionable," he said.
Class action suits, in which many people sue together, are not as common in Europe as they are in the US, but Schrems argued that individual Facebook users could not afford the legal costs of individually fighting their cases against the Silicon Valley tech giant. Instead, Schrems, who is a lawyer, is fighting the case pro bono. Other costs are being covered by German financing company Roland Prozessfinanz.
A Facebook spokesperson welcomed Bobek's decision. "Today's opinion supports the decisions of two courts that Mr. Schrems' claims cannot proceed as 'class action' on behalf of other consumers in Austrian courts," the spokesperson said in a statement.
Schrems said he can still achieve something, even if the class action suit doesn't work out. "I can at least bring a 'model case' at my home jurisdiction in Vienna, which may enable us to debate the illegal practices of Facebook in an open court for the first time," he said.
Five EU judges will consider Bobek's opinion and are expected to make a decision in early 2018 about whether the case can proceed.

Paris.
Airbnb is capping the number of days per year its users can rent out their properties in central Paris.
The popular home rental app, which has had run-ins with regulators around the world, will only allow hosts to rent for 120 days per year. This will bring users in line with France's official laws on short-term rentals, according to Reuters. A "nights hosted" counter will be added to users' profiles to help track the number of nights they've already rented out their homes.
The rental cap will only apply to Paris' first four districts (or "arrondissements") unless the host has authorisation to rent a property for longer. This means it could be harder to find an Airbnb next door to popular tourist spots such as the Louvre, Notre-Dame cathedral and the Marais. (The Eiffel Tower, in the seventh arrondissement, is safe for now.)
Last December Airbnb limited the number of days users could rent out their properties per year in London and Amsterdam to 90 and 60 days respectively. Meanwhile property owners in San Francisco have been limited to 60 days per year.
"Paris is the number one city in the world for Airbnb and we want to make sure our community grows responsibly and sustainably. While experts across the world agree that Airbnb has no significant impact on the housing market, we want to do our bit to address historic housing concerns in Central Paris and help make this city a better place for everyone. We know this solution is effective, targets bad actors and is free for everyone, and we hope other platforms will follow and introduce similar measures to promote responsible and sustainable travel in Paris," said Emmanuel Marill, General Manager for Airbnb in France.  
The decision will come into effect in January.


Google's tribute to the hole puncher.
While not quite as indispensable as the stapler, the hole puncher has been a staple of business offices for more than a century.
It's not only helped corral dangerously thick reams of papers for easier organization, the hole puncher has also provided many a test of physical strength. It challenges whether our grip or downward force is strong enough to puncture the stack, pushing out a neat cylinder of future confetti -- or whether we had to reduce the load, like a dejected weightlifter.
History tells us we have Friedrich Soennecken, a German entrepreneur and inventor, to thank for this officious yet sometimes physically demanding office tool. Soennecken, who fittingly also introduced the ring binder, filed a patent for the hole puncher on Nov. 14, 1886.
To celebrate the 131st anniversary of that filing, Google launched an animated Doodle Tuesday that demonstrates the joy often associated with a successful punch. The fruits of that labor make up most of the Doodle, providing a happier use to the unwieldy mess usually left over from the task.
As we move toward a digital existence increasingly devoid of paper, take a moment to appreciate that feeling of achievement that can still be gained from a 19th century relic.

Australians will soon have access to the wonders of Amazon online shopping.
Australians have been patiently waiting and now the time has come: Amazon expects to launch down under within two weeks.
The world's biggest online retailer is contacting sellers advising them to get their products online and ready to sell by "mid-November," according to emails seen by CNET. The company adds in the emails that Amazon Marketplace, which lets other company sell their wares on Amazon's sites, "will hopefully be launching for Black Friday."
Two people familiar with Amazon's plans confirmed that Amazon's goal is to go live by Black Friday, which lands on Nov. 24. But the final launch date is still yet to be confirmed as the company races to finalise its plans in time for the holiday shopping season, both people said.
Amazon has been "pushing hard" to launch by that date to hit one of the biggest sales days of the holiday shopping season, according to one of those sources, Peter Kearns of 180Commerce, a US company that provides services for Amazon sellers. He added that Amazon has been actively recruiting sellers from both the US and Australia to help fill the virtual shelves of its new Australia storefront.
Amazon didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.
The Australia roll out is part of Amazon's broader global expansion, as it works to keep up its rapid growth and fend off competitors like Alibaba and Walmart. Amazon brought its popular Prime membership service to China and India last year and bought Middle East e-commerce site Souq.com this year.
The Black Friday plans offer the first hard date from Amazon for when it plans to open in Australia. On Monday, Amazon Australia country manager Rocco Braeuniger took to the stage at an Amazon Seller Summit in Sydney, saying the company was launching "really, really soon."
The choice of Black Friday makes sense for a massive US company like Amazon. The day after the US Thanksgiving holiday, Black Friday has long marked the start of holiday shopping in the US. In recent years, Black Friday has turned into one of the biggest trading days for both online and brick-and-mortar stores.
Now Amazon wants to capture some of that lightning in Australia.
Until now, Amazon's presence in Australia has been limited to selling Kindle devices and e-books, its enterprise cloud computing platform Amazon Web Services, and the subscription Amazon Prime Video service, which launched in December last year. 
While anticipation from Australian consumers (and trepidation from rival retailers) has only increased in recent months, the company has kept tight-lipped about launch plans in what will be its next major global market. In January this year, the company quietly began a hiring spree, advertising more than 100 roles including positions in its AmazonFresh grocery delivery department.
In April, the company officially confirmed rumours of an expansion into Australia, before unveiling the location of its first fulfillment centre -- a 24,000 square metre warehouse on the outskirts of Melbourne, Victoria. The company also added to the hype by announcing a further hiring spree and plans to stock the warehouse with "hundreds of thousands of products."
Now, we have a clearer idea of what those products will be. At Monday's Seller Summit, Amazon confirmed it will launch in Australia with its own retail range of products as well as products from third parties, sold through Amazon Marketplace.
Amazon trotted a number of these sellers onstage, including the heads of Australian baby accessories company Hip Cub, camera lens brand Gobe and anti-ageing skincare brand Vidi. Between blasts of motivational pop music, the sellers spruiked the benefits of being on Amazon for growing sales, reaching global markets and earning a "seven figure salary."
The company also used Monday's event to promote its Fulfillment by Amazon program -- a service that lets sellers use Amazon's warehouse as a central hub to store, pack and ship their products to customers.
As for Amazon's fabled two-day shipping, Aussies may have to wait on that front. The company gave no word about who it would use for shipping and what delivery times Australians could expect. But one seller who appeared on stage let slip that Australians could expect two-day delivery when Amazon Marketplace is up and running.

Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates is investing in construction of a proposed smart city in the Arizona desert.
Bill Gates can see the future -- in the Arizona desert.
An investment firm controlled by the Microsoft co-founder and philanthropist has bought nearly 25,000 acres about 45 miles west of Phoenix to build a smart city, a community built from the ground up with the idea of integrating technology into its residents' lives. The proposed community, known as Belmont, would serve as a "template" for development of sustainable cities capitalizing on cutting-edge infrastructure, the investment firm Belmont Partners said.
"Belmont will create a forward-thinking community with a communication and infrastructure spine that embraces cutting-edge technology, designed around high-speed digital networks, data centers, new manufacturing technologies and distribution models, autonomous vehicles and autonomous logistics hubs," the firm said in a statement Wednesday.
The investment comes amid growing interest in smart cities, communities that use technology to keep streets clean by alerting the sanitation department when public garbage bins are full, for example. Communities that allow residents to unlock their office door and turn on their computer before even arriving at work. Places where residents can use their phones to reserve and get directions to a parking space.
Belmont Partners has spent $80 million on the plot of land for the proposed community, which would be comparable in size and population to nearby Tempe -- 40 square miles and about 160,000 people, the firm said in a statement.
Belmont will be composed of 80,000 residential units, with more than 3,800 acres for office, commercial and retail space, 3,400 acres of open space and 470 acres for public schools, the firm said.

Steve Jurvetson has left his VC firm amid sexual harassment allegations.
Silicon Valley's sexual harassment problems continue.
Steve Jurvetson, one of Silicon Valley's most high-profile venture capitalists, has left his namesake firm, Draper Fisher Jurvetson, amid a sexual harassment investigation, according to Recode. He's the latest in a string of venture capitalist to be ousted from his firm amid allegations related to misconduct or sexual harassment. 
The publication, citing unnamed sources, said an investigation by DFJ "uncovered behaviors by Jurvetson that were unacceptable related to a negative tone toward women entrepreneurs."
DFJ didn't immediately respond to a request for comment, but operating partner Heidi Roizen confirmed in a statement the firm had been "rocked by allegations about sexual harassment." Over the summer, DFJ launched an independent investigation into "allegations of misconduct by one (and only one) of our partners from a third party." The investigation is ongoing.
Jurvetson said in an email that he's leaving the firm "to focus on personal matters, including taking legal action against those whose false statements have defamed me." He also tweeted that statement. 
I am leaving DFJ to focus on personal matters, including taking legal action against those whose false statements have defamed me.
Jurvetson is one of Silicon Valley's best-known venture capitalists. He was a founding investor in Hotmail, which was later bought by Microsoft, and serves on the boards of Elon Musk's Tesla and SpaceX. Earlier this year, SV Forum awarded Jurvetson its Visionary Award "for his role in fostering the spirit of entrepreneurship in Silicon Valley." In 2016, President Barack Obama named him a Presidential Ambassador for Global Entrepreneurship. 
SpaceX and Tesla on Monday said Jurvetson was taking "a leave of absence from the SpaceX and Tesla boards pending resolution of these allegations."
Late last month, Keri Kukral, a female entrepreneur, wrote in a Facebook post that "women approached by a founding partner of Draper Fisher Jurvetson should be careful. Predatory behavior is rampant." She didn't name Jurvetson specifically. 
Kukral didn't immediately respond to a request for comment Monday.
In her statement, DFJ's Roizen disputed the characterization of the firm. 
"I don't need an investigation to state with certainty that this is patently wrong," Roizen wrote. "I am too grizzled and old to write bullshit about a company to please my boss. I'm writing this because I believe it to be true." 
She added that she "would not work for DFJ if I felt the culture was not one of high integrity and opportunity for all -- including women."
Jurvetson isn't the only VC to have allegedly harassed women. Binary Capital co-founder Justin Caldbeck left his job in June after a story in The Information said he'd allegedly made sexual advances at female entrepreneurs. Chris Sacca of Lowercase Capital and Dave McClure of 500 Startups issued public apologies after being named in a report later that month by The New York Times about sexual harassment in the technology startup industry. In July, Frank Artale, a managing partner at venture capital firm Ignition Partners, resigned after a complaint of misconduct from an anonymous source.
Prominent blogger Robert Scoble and Amazon Studios head Roy Price also resigned from their positions following allegations of sexual harassment.
The departures have shined a light on difficulties faced by women in Silicon Valley. Women remain in the minority at many companies, despite efforts by organizations to seek more diversity. In recent months, many woman have come forward with complaints of sexual harassment and other issues in Silicon Valley, Hollywood and other areas. 
To help encourage female entrepreneurs, a group of female venture capitalists on Monday started a new program, called Female Founder Office Hours. 
"The idea is to host free, quarterly events that explore topics across the range of company stages," according to TechCrunch. The first event, slated for Nov. 30 in San Francisco, will focus on helping seed-stage female founders with their pitches. The group will offer 40 one-on-one office hour slots with 10 female VC partners from Benchmark, Canaan, Cowboy, Forerunner, Freestyle, Lux, Sequoia and Reach. Two female founders who are now VCs also will discuss fundraising.  
"Our goal is for every female founder to walk away with a bit of advice from some female investors and a few new female founder friends that they can count on," the group said on its website. "We hope to use this to kick-start a virtuous cycle and community of women helping women."

Google is facing another investigation into its business practices. 
Google's facing another investigation into its business practices.
The attorney general for Missouri, Josh Hawley, on Monday said he has issued an investigative subpoena to Google to determine if it has violated Missouri's main consumer protection law and its antitrust laws. 
Missouri is examining "Google's collection, use, and disclosure of information about Google users and their online activities; Google's alleged misappropriation of online content from the websites of its competitors; and Google's alleged manipulation of search results to preference websites owned by Google and to demote websites that compete with Google."
"There is strong reason to believe that Google has not been acting with the best interest of Missourians in mind," Hawley said. "My office will not stand by and let private consumer information be jeopardized by industry giants, especially to pad their profits."
Google said that it hasn't yet received the subpoena. "However, we have strong privacy protections in place for our users and continue to operate in a highly competitive and dynamic environment," Google spokesman Patrick Lenihan said. 
The inquiry by Missouri isn't the first such probe Google has faced. The European Union in June slapped Google with a record $2.7 billion fine for favoring its own shopping services in its search results over those of rivals. The EU also has been investigating whether Google hurt app rivals by demanding its own service be preinstalled on all Android phones, as well as looking into accusations that Google blocked rivals in online search advertising. The inquiry comes also as Google, Facebook and Twitter face questions over their role in enabling the spread of fake news and the Russian misinformation campaign.
The Wall Street Journal earlier reported news of the investigation.

Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates at the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative in 2016.
Bill Gates is known for his generosity, and he's taking it further with an investment into Alzheimer's research.
The founder of Microsoft has given away $32.91 billion over his lifetime, much of which has been spent as the richest person in the world. His latest $100 million gift will reportedly be going in two equal chunks to organizations on the cutting edge of fighting dementia.
The Dementia Discovery Fund will get the first $50 million to help its mission of bringing together government and industry to work on treatments, Gates wrote on his personal blog. The second will go to "less mainstream" start-up ventures working in Alzheimer's research, he told Reuters. Both donations will come from his personal accounts and not the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
Alzheimer's is a form of dementia that affects more than 5 million Americans. 
"Of all the disorders that plague us late in life, one stands out as a particularly big threat to society: Alzheimer's disease," Gates said in his blog. "You have a nearly 50 percent chance of developing the disease if you live into your mid-80s."
Current treatments can only ease the symptoms. 
"I hope that in the next 10 years that we have some powerful drugs," Gates told Reuters, "but it's possible that won't be achieved."

Qualcomm to Broadcom: Take your billions and go homecomm.
The board of directors at Qualcomm, the world's largest maker of chips and processors for phones, on Monday unanimously rejected a massive unsolicited takeover bid from Broadcom, which makes chips for everything from cable modems to set-top boxes and digital video recorders.
"Broadcom's proposal significantly undervalues Qualcomm relative to the company's leadership position in mobile technology and our future growth prospects," said Paul Jacobs, chairman of Qualcomm's board, in a statement. Qualcomm also said that the deal would come with significant regulatory uncertainty.
Broadcom said it remains fully committed to pursuing the acquisition.
"We continue to believe our proposal represents the most attractive, value-enhancing alternative available to Qualcomm stockholders and we are encouraged by their reaction," said Broadcom CEO Hock Tan in a statement. "Many have expressed to us their desire that Qualcomm meet with us to discuss our proposal."
The acquisition would have been the biggest in tech history, surpassing AOL's acquisition of Time Warner in 2001. The combined company would have been the third-largest semiconductor maker in the world, trailing only Intel and Samsung.
Update, 11:40 a.m. ET: Added statement from Broadcom.


The Apple Store on Regent Street in central London.
Like jewelry stores, Apple retail outlets packed with expensive gear evidently make tempting targets for thieves.
Early Monday morning, a gang of 10 robbers on five mopeds broke into the flagship UK Apple Store in central London's busy Regent Street, by driving a moped through the glass front doors, the Evening Standard reports. They threatened two security guards with hammers, and left after three minutes.
The raiders managed to escape with iPhones, iPads and Apple Watches. Two iPhone Xs were later recovered. The store was back to normal operation later that morning.
Apple did not immediately reply to a request for comment.


This Singles' Day, Alibaba raked in more than $25.3 billion. Because, single or not, who doesn't love a good deal?
Two isn't always better than one, at least not for Alibaba Group.
The Chinese e-commerce giant broke records and calculated $25.3 billion in sales generated from 1.48 billion shoppers via Alipay on its annual Singles' Day global shopping festival on Nov. 11, or 11/11, it said in a statement released Sunday. That's an increase of 39 percent from last year.
Singles' Day is perhaps the biggest online shopping extravaganza worldwide, dwarfing international equivalents like Black Friday and Cyber Monday. The day, chosen for the collection of ones in its name, started out as a kind of "anti-Valentine's Day" where China's lonely hearts revel in their singlehood. It was popularised by Alibaba as an annual online shopping spree in 2009, where participating companies offered discounts to shoppers for a 24-hour period.
International stars like Jessie J, Nicole Kidman and Pharrell Williams graced the gala this year, with Alibaba CEO Daniel Zhang expressing hopes to take it overseas, although no timeline was confirmed. Other Chinese online shopping platforms such as JD.com have also jumped on the bandwagon, contributing to a total of $38.2 billion in sales this year.
Alibaba said it raked in almost $12 billion within the first two hours, and the number more than doubled to over $25 billion by the end of the shopping bonanza.
Not everyone is celebrating Singles' Day, however. Greenpeace released research days before the event showing it generated enormous amounts of CO2 emissions last year and called it a "catastrophe for the environment."

Uber's board has reached a deal that will allow SoftBank to make a $10 billion investment in the ride-hailing startup.
Uber's board of directors reached a deal Sunday that will allow SoftBank to make a multibillion-dollar investment in the ride-hailing startup.
The agreement resolves a legal battle between Uber cofounder and former CEO Travis Kalanick and Benchmark Capital, one of the startup's early investors, Reuters reported Sunday. Benchmark Capital, which owns about 13 percent of Uber, sued Kalanick in August, alleging that Kalanick misled Uber's stockholders to gain control of three board seats.
"We've entered into an agreement with a consortium led by SoftBank and Dragoneer on a potential investment," an Uber representative said in a statement. "We believe this agreement is a strong vote of confidence in Uber's long-term potential. Upon closing, it will help fuel our investments in technology and our continued expansion at home and abroad, while strengthening our corporate governance."
The agreement comes a month after Uber's board voted to eliminate its super-voting structure, in which early shareholders had 10 times the voting power, to a one vote per share model, according to a source familiar with the vote. The board also voted to expand the number of board members to 17, adding six seats to dilute additions made by Kalanick in September.
At the same time, Uber's board approved the sale of $10 billion of stock to SoftBank, a Japanese internet giant. SoftBank plans to acquire a 14 percent to 20 percent stake in the world's most valuable privately-held tech startup, board member Arianna Huffington said in October.
The vote came amid a tumultuous year for the ride-hailing startup, which has been rocked by a slew of scandals, including sexual harassment allegations that resulted in more than 20 Uber employees being fired. The company has been caught using a secretive tool called Greyball to avoid local authorities. The company is also defending itself against a trade-secret theft lawsuit from Waymo, a self-driving car business run by Alphabet, Google's parent company.

Technically Incorrect offers a slightly twisted take on the tech that's taken over our lives.
Heresy. Pure heresy.
Kids, please don't read this. 
Go play your video games or waft to Snapchat to look at fascinating pictures.
This is for adults only.
You see, Amazon has just released a Christmas ad that's peddling heresy and confusing children. At least in the eyes of some.
It features a dad who's ordered Christmas gifts on the famed retail site and is sneaking them upstairs so the kids don't see.
This is a scene that will happen in millions of homes all over the world. It is, however, a scene that, when presented on TV, is appalling some. 
The mere thought that some kids might see this and stop believing in Santa is just too much. 
Why, both the Sun and the Daily Mail explained that parents are turning to social media and screaming to the high heavens.
Here's a sample from Twitter. 
Parents' outrage over 'disgusting' Amazon Christmas advert which shows dad delivering presents NOT Santa - The Sun https://t.co/G64jF2c1fN
Some might wonder whether a gift-bearing Santa is actually in the Bible. I don't sink to such quibbling.
But some parents truly seem to be appalled that they now have to explain real life to 3-year-olds.
Thanks @amazon for your advert my 3 year old is asking why the man is hideing with presents, asking if he's Santa 🎅🏻 #confusing #Christmas
The 3-year-old asks a very good question. The man in the ad has a beard, albeit a dark one. He could be like Clark Kent during the day and Super Santa at night.
Naturally, some have chosen to make light of this manifestly serious situation.
Kid at Safeway: "Daddy, how does Santa deliver all those presents in one night?"Me, joining the conversation: "https://t.co/UyxWPyzISz same day free shipping"Dad, glaring at me, then nodding and smiling: "That's right! He uses Amazon like we do!"
I contacted Amazon's UK arm to ask about its apparent assault on hallowed values.
A company spokesman told me: "Father Christmas and his elves are no doubt working around the clock to get presents to girls and boys around the world. These are just a few extra to give a little love from parents."
Oh, dear. That's going to make it even more confusing for kids. 
So which presents are the more meaningful?
The ones that Santa brought? Or the ones that lazy old dad bought on Amazon? 
Dad, why did you only get me this Sigmund Freud coloring book, when Santa brought me an iPhone X and a horse?


Technically Incorrect offers a slightly twisted take on the tech that's taken over our lives.
He likes to tell a joke or two.
There's been so much news this week, what with the Xbox One X being launched and the iPhone X undergoing teething troubles. (Its teeth are chattering in the cold, apparently.)
You might, therefore, have missed a touching tweak of Apple's cheek offered by Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella on a trip to India.
He was there to create excitement around the idea that the Microsoft brand has changed. 
In many ways, the job Nadella has done to try to make Microsoft relevant in the modern world -- and still a competitor in some spheres to Apple -- has been praiseworthy.  
Indeed, he seems to be so confident now that he'll cheerily make quips about Apple.
As TechRadar's Sahil Mohan Gupta reports, Nadella walked into a room and couldn't help but chuckle.
"Nadella spots that I and a colleague have iPads and cheerfully says, 'You need to get a real computer, my friend,'" said Gupta. 
And you thought Nadella's overarching strategy was to be on good terms with everyone. 
It's curious how rival companies choose to periodically belittle Apple, then withdraw, only to succumb to the temptation all over again.
Microsoft, for example, has insisted that Windows 10 computers can do more than Macs. The company has laughed at Apple's claim that the iPad Pro is a computer. One of its executives has also suggested that the iPad Pro is merely an example of Apple copying Microsoft.
It's not as if Microsoft is alone. This week, Samsung emerged from a period of ignoring Apple in its ads to insult the last 10 years of the iPhone.
Neither Microsoft nor Apple responded to a request for comment.
Though Apple has long ignored competitors in its ads, its executives haven't always refrained from mocking other companies. Why, last year Apple's senior vice president of worldwide marketing, Phil Schiller, observed that using an old PC is "really sad."
Though Nadella's comment is surely industry humor, he does believe Microsoft is different from both Apple and Google.
"I don't want to take away from whatever success Apple or Google are  having," he told TechRadar. "We are very different companies. We are not some middleman in  the marketplace. We are a tool creator, we are not a luxury good  manufacturer. That's not who we are. We are about creating technologies  so that others can build."
Not a luxury good manufacturer? All right, now that is a bona fide Apple burn.
Does the Mac still matter? Apple execs explain why the MacBook Pro was over four years in the making, and why we should care.

Uber is fighting to have its London licence renewed.
Ride-hailing app Uber has lost an appeal against a ruling that its drivers should be classed as workers instead of as self-employed. 
Uber's appeal was rejected at the Employment Appeal Tribunal (EAT) in London on Friday morning, according to Reuters.
"I have been campaigning against Uber since 2014 and although I always knew I was on the right side, it has always been a struggle that has brought enormous pressure on us. I am glad that the judge today confirmed what I and thousands of drivers have known all along: That Uber is not only exploiting drivers, but also acting unlawfully," said co-claimant Yaseen Aslam, who has the backing of the Independent Workers' Union of Great Britain. 
Uber has said it will appeal the decision.
In today's tech news, Uber could stop operating in London within days, Facebook ditches plans to restructure shares and Homeland Security confirms 2016 election hacks.
"The tribunal relies on the assertion that drivers are required to take 80% of trips sent to them when logged into the app," said Tom Elvidge, Uber UK's acting general manager. "As drivers who use Uber know, this has never been the case in the UK. Over the last year we have made a number of changes to our app to give drivers even more control. We've also invested in things like access to illness and injury cover and we'll keep introducing changes to make driving with Uber even better. Almost all taxi and private hire drivers have been self-employed for decades, long before our app existed." 
The news comes as Uber continues to attempt to regain its licence in London after Transport for London, the city's transport regulator, said the company was "unfit" to serve the capital.

"My purpose here is to recruit you to be part of the solution to the climate crisis," he told the audience at Web Summit -- Europe's biggest tech conference -- in Lisbon on Thursday. "You can have a bigger impact than practically any other group in the entire world."
It's the latest pitch by the former US vice president as he continues his mission to protect the environment. Gore, the man behind the award-winning documentary "An Inconvenient Truth" and chairman of Generation Investment Management, an investment fund focused on sustainable companies, believes change is coming.
Artificial intelligence, machine learning and the internet of things are trends that Gore said will help future generations more easily preserve the planet.
"Our world is now in the early stages of a sustainability revolution... that has the speed of the digital revolution," he said.
An area where tech is making a real impact is in making alternative sources of energy, including solar, battery storage and wind farms, more viable. When it comes to the generation of electricity, the cost of solar power has fallen so fast that it is now significantly cheaper in many parts of the world than other forms of electricity, Gore said.
"Tech is helping us to displace fossil fuels to generate electricity from new, sustainable sources," he said. "We can match it up to the transportation system by shifting over to electric vehicles as quick as we possibly can."
Solar energy and electric vehicles are close to Gore's heart but also his business interests. His group backs a solar energy company based in Africa, along with a number of clean energy-based mobility startups, including Gogoro -- an electric scooter company based in Taiwan.
"Gogoro was founded with the fundamental premise of doing good and doing well," Gogoro's CEO and founder Horace Luke said in an interview. "We share Al Gore's strong conviction for igniting the sustainability revolution and we are honored to have his support."
Gore stated several times in his speech that he would try to restrain himself from touching on politics. But when it came to discussing the Paris climate agreement, he couldn't help but comment on the US withdrawal from the treaty, which every other country in the world has now signed.
The US is still signed up to the Paris agreement until at least 2020, he said, adding: By the way, if there is a new president, a new president can simply give 30 days notice and the US is back in the agreement."
Thanks to the attitudes of individual states and businesses, the current figures show that the US will still meet and even exceed its commitments under the agreement. "We are going to do our part in spite of Donald Trump," Gore said.
But that doesn't solve the bigger problem. "If you add up all of the commitments," he said, "they still don't add up to enough to solve the crisis."
This is where the tech community has a chance to step in.
Gore reassured entrepreneurs in the audience that there were plenty of investors out there that weren't just funding tech "to make a quick buck," but to make a real difference in the world.
"I want you to know that there is a growing market for the kinds of initiative that many of you have labored long and hard to bring to fruition," he said. "Everything is at stake. Now is your time."


The percentage of women at Apple hasn't increased over the past year. 
Apple made some progress in hiring more minorities. But when it comes to women, its efforts fell flat. 
The company on Thursday released its annual diversity and inclusion report, the first since creating a new vice president position to oversee the area. Denise Young Smith, Apple's former head of HR, was named to the role in May.
Only about a third of Apple employees as of July 2017 were women, the same level as last year, the company said. When it came to underrepresented minorities, Apple reported a 1 percentage point increase to 23 percent. In the US, Apple's work force was 54 percent white, down two percentage points from the year earlier.
"We're proud of our accomplishments, but we have much more work to do," Apple said in its report. 
Apple has 130,000 full- and part-time employees around the world, with 83,000 of those working in the US. Its figures include its Apple Store employees, not just the engineers, designers and others working for the corporate parent. The company didn't disclose how many people work in retail.
Apple and other tech companies have been trying to diversify their workforce, which includes boosting the number of female and minority employees. Under CEO Tim Cook's leadership, Apple has put itself at the front of social issues like LGBT rights, racial equality and the tech industry's need to improve workforce diversity. Still, it's been difficult for Apple and its peers to show significant percentage increases in diversifying its employee base.
Apple said Thursday that the total number of female employees stayed flat at 32 percent as of July 2017. 
The company touted an improvement in attracting younger female employees. The number of female employees under the age of 30 has increased 5 percentage points over the past three years to 36 percent. Over that same timeframe, the total number of female employees has risen 2 percentage points, which equals 37,000 women. 
Apple's top leadership has showed little improvement in terms of boosting the number of women. In the past year, the number of women in leadership roles rose 1 percentage point to 29 percent. That was after staying flat at 28 percent from 2014 to 2016.
Only one woman, retail chief Angela Ahrendts, holds a title of senior vice president or higher, though Apple has promoted women to lower leadership levels in recent months, including Deidre O'Brien to vice president of people and Isabel Mahe to managing director of Greater China. 
"Our female representation is steadily increasing, and we're proud of the progress we're making," Apple said in its diversity report. 
Apple also said that it's been actively hiring more employees from "historically underrepresented groups in tech -- women, black, Hispanic, Native American, and Native Hawaiian & other Pacific Islander." From July 2016 to July 2017, 50 percent of its new hires came from those groups. The company said 15 percent of its new hires over the past year are Hispanic, while 11 percent are black.

Facebook is trying a new way to combat revenge porn.
Facebook is asking people to share their nude photos. But this isn't what it sounds like.
The goal of the social network's plan is make sure people's nude photos aren't used for revenge porn by a disgruntled ex-boyfriend or girlfriend, according to the Australian Broadcasting Corp. Facebook already has a reporting system in place for when someone's intimate photos are shared without consent, but the idea with this program is to nix the photos before they're disseminated in the first place.
The way it'll work is people will share their photos with Facebook via its Messenger app and the company will then "hash" the images, which is a process that converts the photos into a unique digital code. Once Facebook has that code, it can block the images from ever being uploaded to its site.
The company is piloting the technology in Australia with a small government agency headed by e-Safety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant.
"We see many scenarios where maybe photos or videos were taken consensually at one point, but there was not any sort of consent to send the images or videos more broadly," Inman Grant told the ABC.
Other tech companies have used similar types of hashing technology in efforts to rid the internet of child pornography. Google, Microsoft and Twitter have used unique digital codes to detect exploitative images, some of which have led to the arrests of people distributing the photographs on the web.
Facebook published a blog post Thursday that gives more specifics on the pilot project. The company said it's constantly working to prevent revenge porn and was looking to try something different. For the program, the social network has partnered with an international working group of survivors, victim advocates and other experts.
"This program is completely voluntary," wrote Antigone Davis, Facebook's global head of safety. "It's a protective measure that can help prevent a much worse scenario where an image is shared more widely."
Facebook didn't respond to a request for comment.

San Francisco aims to cut down on ride-hailing drivers double-parking when picking up and dropping off passengers.
As ride-hailing services like Uber and Lyft have grown in popularity, so has a common complaint: congestion.
Cyclists complain bike lanes are blocked as drivers double-park to pick-up and drop-off passengers. Pedestrians say crosswalks are often obstructed. And other drivers say they get stuck behind ride-hailing cars pulled over to load up passengers.
San Francisco has asked Uber and Lyft to work with it to deal with these issues. Mayor Ed Lee publicly announced a pilot program on Tuesday that will designate specific loading zones for drivers of the ride-hailing companies, according to the San Francisco Examiner.
"The best way to solve any problem is to bring people to the table and build consensus," Lee said in a emailed statement. "By working together, we have created a data-driven pilot program that will address the public safety and traffic implications of ride-sharing vehicles double parking, blocking bike lanes and impeding traffic. This is just the beginning of our effort to make our streets safer for pedestrians and bicyclists and more efficient for all those on the road."
Lee initially sent letters to Uber and Lyft in May addressing his concerns around ride-hailing and public safety. Since then, the city and the companies have continued conversations on the matter.
"Lyft looks forward to partnering with the Mayor's office to see how we can most effectively and efficiently use curb space in the city," said a Lyft spokeswoman. "We have been participating in meetings with the pilot's stakeholder group since May and appreciate the Mayor's leadership on this important issue."
An Uber spokesman echoed Lyft's sentiments and said, "We've made substantial progress to meet our shared goals to reduce congestion and improve public safety."
The way the program would work is both companies would use what's called "geofencing" software in the app to tell passengers and drivers where to meet. Both Uber and Lyft already use the software in certain scenarios, like pick-ups at airports, train stations and sports arenas.
San Francisco is the first major city to announce plans to work with the companies to cut down on ride-hailing congestion. Both Uber and Lyft already use geofencing at the city's King Caltrain station and the California Pacific Medical Center campus. 
Once the loading zone pilot gets underway, Lee requested that the companies share data with the city, such as anonymized trip details. He said this is to ensure compliance from the companies and to evaluate the success of the program. It's still unclear when the pilot will begin and where and how many loading zones will be designated.

Logitech will replace the Harmony Link with its successor, the Harmony Hub.
Two months after Logitech announced it would be bricking its Harmony Link (which allows you to control your TV using a phone or tablet as a remote) and charging people to replace it with a newer product, it suddenly rose to a cause celebre across the web on Wednesday. On Thursday, Logitech announced on its blog that it would replace them for free -- and even offers a refund to those who've already buckled and bought it. 
Beginning with "we heard you and we want to make it right," Logitech went on to say it would contact current Harmony Link owners to initiate the replacement/refund process. You can also contact the company about it here. 
Logitech provided a bit more detail about the "why," as well:
We made the business decision to end the support and services of the Harmony Link when the encryption certificate expires in the spring of 2018 -- we would be acting irresponsibly by continuing the service knowing its potential/future vulnerability. Our system shows this product, which was last sold by Logitech in fall of 2015, had a small active user base.
While it still burns that a company can make a device you own simply stop working, there's really no way to win in this situation. Given the security vulnerabilities inherent in the internet of things, it makes sense to close the holes where you can.
Logitech also responded to the criticism that it was blocking the phrase "class action lawsuit" on its forums.
The words "class action lawsuit" were blocked as our Community Terms of Use do not allow solicitation, including legal solicitation. We have unblocked the terms and are reviewing our list of blocked terms.
That's kind of interesting, and I bet it's far from the only company that does that. After all, what business wants lawyers trolling the most fertile place to find angry customers in search of satisfaction?

Has CNN become a key factor in AT&T's potential buyout of Time Warner?
AT&T's $85.4 billion acquisition of Time Warner has hit a snag. 
To close the deal, the US Justice Department is demanding that the Dallas-based telecommunications giant sell Turner Broadcasting, which includes CNN, according to the Financial Times (account required), which cited unnamed sources. The New York Times reported that AT&T could also win approval if it sold its DirecTV unit, which it just acquired in 2015. 
The reports are accurate, according to people familiar with the situation. 
CNN and Turner Broadcasting is a principal asset at Time Warner, which includes movie and television studios such as HBO, as well as publishing and music businesses. AT&T is hoping to use its acquisition of Time Warner to cement its position as a Hollywood powerhouse, diversifying itself away from offering just phone, wireless and pay-TV services. 
AT&T and Time Warner would go to court to challenge the government's legal basis for blocking the deal if these demands are formally made, the Times reported.
"Until now, we've never commented on our discussions with the DOJ," AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson said. "But given DOJ's statement this afternoon, it's important to set the record straight. Throughout this process, I have never offered to sell CNN and have no intention of doing so."
AT&T Chief Financial Officer John Stephens said this morning that it was unclear when the deal would close. The company had previously said the transaction would be completed by the end of the year, but last month it extended the deadline. 
A Time Warner spokesman declined to comment. 
A spokesman for the Justice Department declined to comment on the AT&T-Time Warner deal. 
"The Department is committed to carrying out its duties in accordance with the laws and the facts. Beyond that, the Department does not comment on any pending investigation."
President Donald Trump has been a frequent critic of CNN, often calling its content "fake news" and arguing that the news channel presents him in an unfavorable light. During the presidential campaign last year, Trump said he would squash the deal if he were to become president.

Now you'll see crowd sourced restaurant ratings in the UberEats app.
UberEats wants to get to know you.
The food-delivery service added three new features to its app on Thursday that aim to learn your tastes, preferences and likes. It'll now show "recommended for you" menu items, eater-generated restaurant ratings and also let you "favorite" certain dining spots. Essentially, UberEats is getting more personal.
"With such a large and growing selection of restaurants on the platform, we're thinking how can we show you what you want," said Ambika Krishnamachar, a product manager for UberEats.
UberEats is the food-delivery branch of the ride-hailing service Uber. Similar to how people can hail an Uber ride with the push of a button on their smartphone, they can also order food from dozens of local restaurants using the UberEats app.
UberEats suggests menu items based on what you've ordered in the past.
On-demand food is a competitive space. Besides UberEats, people have a multitude of apps to choose from. There's Caviar, Grubhub, Seamless, DoorDash and Postmates. There's also the old-fashioned choice of simply calling a restaurant and ordering food, although not all restaurants deliver. By making its service more personalized, UberEats aims to stand above the rest.
The food delivery service first launched in 2014 in Los Angeles under the moniker UberFresh. Then eventually it morphed into UberEats with an official launch in Toronto, Canada, in December 2015. By the end of 2016, UberEats was is 56 cities worldwide. Today it's in 130 cities and is slated to be in 200 by the end of the year. UberEats is even in some cities that don't have the ride-hailing service, such as Tokyo, Taipei and Seoul.
UberEats partners with restaurants, so restaurants can decide what they want to sell on the app. The company charges restaurants a service fee that's calculated as a percentage of its sales on the platform. Uber now has partnerships with 80,000 restaurants, which include everything from upscale eateries to McDonald's.
"With an increasing choice of selection it becomes a little bit more difficult to choose what you want to order," said Calvin Lee, UberEats product manager. Uber has created "technical solutions to solve some of the pain points for our customers."
UberEats' new "recommended for you" feature uses machine learning to personalize the app based on what each person is ordering and favoriting. It looks at past restaurant and menu item choices to make suggestions -- much like how Netflix makes movie recommendations. So, if you tend to order pasta, UberEats will likely show you a restaurant's spaghetti, lasagna or tortellini dishes.
"Every single consumer on the platform is super different," Krishnamachar said. "By learning your preferences we can more intelligently suggest food that you like."
UberEats' new restaurant ratings work a little differently. Krishnamachar said ratings aim to better guide eaters in picking restaurants and to help restaurants better learn what dishes are resonating with people. The feature will have a five-star rating system and show feedback over the last 90 days.
Sometimes negative ratings can hurt restaurants. Businesses have complained that they've lost customers after receiving bad ratings on sites like Yelp, OpenTable and MenuPages. Krishnamachar said negative ratings shouldn't harm UberEats' partner restaurants since they refresh on a rolling 90-day basis.
"It motivates a high-quality experience across the board," she said. "At the end of the day, we're reflecting what customers are saying."

TripAdvisor warning badge.
TripAdvisor has started adding warnings to business pages where public safety issues -- including sexual assault -- have been reported.
"We have decided to introduce a new 'badge' notification that will be displayed on a business' listing page when an issue relating to that business is reported on by credible media sources, such as issues around health and safety or allegations of discrimination," a spokesperson said in a statement.
"We've made the decision to badge several hotels in Mexico, most recently reported on within the press for having issues with tainted alcohol and sexual assault."
The badges will remain on a company's page for three months, but will be extended for longer if reports persist.
"The aim of the badge is to alert travellers to issues they may want to more fully research outside of TripAdvisor."
TripAdvisor came under fire recently, TechCrunch reports, for removing a review in which the writer described being raped at a hotel resort. TripAdvisor restored the review and the resort is one of the businesses that features the new warning badge.


Snap's growth hasn't been the most encouraging.
There's someone who still believes in Snapchat's creators.
Chinese tech behemoth Tencent has taken a 12 percent stake in social media giant Snap, according to the Financial Times. Tencent sits among China's three biggest tech companies along with Baidu and Alibaba, collectively known as BAT.
The news, revealed Wednesday in Snap's quarterly filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, comes after the company posted disappointing results of its growth this quarter.
This is not Tencent's first investment in a US company that brought us disappearing messages. Tencent bought a 5 percent stake in Tesla in March. Tencent, the creator of popular Chinese mobile game Honour of Kings, also owns Riot Games, the maker of League of Legends.
It's no secret that Tencent has been making efforts to expand to the US. Also the owner of Chinese messaging platform, WeChat, Tencent brought its digital payment service, WeChat Pay, to the US earlier this year.
In the SEC filing, Snap said it has "long been inspired by the creativity and entrepreneurial spirit of Tencent." 
Tencent President Martin Lau said the company "looks forward to sharing ideas and experiences." This could come in the form of a collaboration between both companies on mobile games and news feed, according to a statement obtained by Reuters.
CNET has reached out to Tencent and Snap for comments.

Huawei is the biggest phone brand you've never heard of. But that second part could change soon.
Code found by XDA Developers indicates a version of Huawei's latest premium phone, the Mate 10 Pro, will be sold through AT&amp;T. The firmware in question showed a Mate 10 Pro loaded with AT&T's apps and software.
This follows months of rumours that AT&T would carry a flagship Huawei phone in the first half of next year, which stemmed from an August report from The Information.
Huawei is the third biggest phone brand in the world, thanks in large part to strong sales in its populous homeland of China. It sold 39 million phones in the third quarter of the year, IDC research showed last week, around 7 million less than Apple.
The Mate 10 Pro is the company's attempt to battle big-screen competitors like the Samsung Galaxy Note 8, Google Pixel 2 XL and Apple's iPhone 8 Plus. It sports a 6-inch display with an 18:9 ratio, and like many phones this year is almost all screen with minimal bezel.
The phone is powered by Huawei's own Kirin 970 processor, a chip roughly comparable to Qualcomm's premium Snapdragon 835. The Kirin 970 has a neural processing unit, or NPU, which the company says improves the Mate 10 Pro's AI capabilities, battery and performance.
Huawei was also the first company to jump on the recent dual-camera craze. Months before Apple released the iPhone 7 Plus, Huawei's P9 phone was equipped with two Leica-branded shooters on its back.
Huawei has technically been selling phones in the US since 2014, but only its budget phones and almost exclusively online. Almost all phones in the US are bought through carriers -- nine out of 10, according to Counterpoint research analyst Neil Shah -- so a deal with AT&T would be the beginning of Huawei's first real shot at cracking the market.
Huawei was contacted for comment while AT&T declined to comment.

The public cafe at Apple Park's visitor center.
If you have been itching for a closer look at Apple's new campus, you may get your chance starting next week.
The visitor center at the new Apple Park campus will open to the public on Nov. 17, according to MacRumors, which cited what it said was an internal email sent to employees Wednesday. That date also appears on an Apple Park sign shared on Twitter on Tuesday that refers to a "grand opening."
Image of an Apple sign identified as being at Apple Park's visitor center.
Apple Park is home to several buildings, most prominently a 2.8 million square foot ring unofficially known as the Spaceship, which boasts four-story curved glass panels, custom aluminum door handles and one of the largest roof-mounted solar farms in the world. It's the new home for more than 12,000 Apple employees, a sizable chunk of Apple's Cupertino, California, workforce. 
The new Apple Park Visitor Center houses its own Apple retail store and Apple's first-ever public cafe, plus an exhibit space.
Apple didn't respond to a request for comment.

After passing the Senate Commerce Committee, new legislation to stop online sex trafficking will now go to the full Senate for a vote.
The US Senate Commerce Committee voted unanimously Wednesday to pass legislation that could curb online sex trafficking.
The legislation would amend a section of the Communications Decency Act by including the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act, S. 1693. The idea of the new act is to better empower state law enforcement officials to go after websites that enable sex trafficking.
Online sex trafficking is often perpetuated though sites like Backpage.com, which has classified advertising where people can solicit prostitutes. Many of the people on this website are trafficked women and children, according to the National Center on Sexual Exploitation.
Now that the bipartisan legislation has passed the Commerce Committee it will go to the full Senate for a vote.
"Congress is one step closer to passing the most important anti-trafficking legislation in nearly twenty years," Lisa L. Thompson, vice president of research and education at the National Center on Sexual Exploitation, said in a statement. "There is no change to federal law more urgent and necessary to fighting sex trafficking than a strong, but narrowly crafted, amendment to the Communications Decency Act."

RIP (in March 2018).
In September, Logitech sent an email to Harmony Link owners stating that the six-year-old product, which lets you control your TV via an app on your phone or tablet, will cease to function after March 16, 2018. 
On a typical Wednesday in November, due to the mysterious forces that govern the web, the story suddenly blew up after newer posts to Logitech's forums caught the eye of Reddit, spurring a tide of angry (and amusing) comments.  
The ire was fued by claims that Logitech was censoring the words "class action lawsuit" in the forums, replacing it with "***** ****** *******." The words were visible in spots when I looked at it, but there were tips in the Reddit thread about circumventing the censorship with unicode characters, which could be why.
One source of umbrage is Logitech's somewhat tone-deaf offer of a 35 percent discount off its newer Harmony Hub smart-home controller, which added a physical remote (now with Alexa!). After all, what's to stop it from bricking that after a few years, too? 
And of course, it renews the debate over cloud-enabled devices and the implicit problem that a company can kill hardware that you've bought because it has the right to disable the software or services that you license to enable it to function.
CNET did not rate the Harmony Link highly when it was released, saying, "you're better off with a standard Harmony remote."


It's early morning. I'm standing on a closed airport runway in Cornwall, England. The weather, foggy with a cold breeze biting at my jacket, doesn't bode well for what I'm about to witness. But in a few hours, a rocket-powered car will roar to life on a trial run in front of thousands of eagerly-waiting public and media.
The Bloodhound SSC is the car that in 2018 will hit speeds of over 1,000 mph, breaking the land-speed record. At least, that's what its designers hope. 
The main attempt, already delayed by over a year, will take place in the desert of South Africa. This run, however, took place on the 2-mile runway at Newquay Airport, in the far southwestern corner of the country about a 6-hour drive from London.
Built from a combination of titanium, aluminium and carbon fibre, the Bloodhound is powered by an EJ200 jet engine -- more commonly found inside Eurofighter Typhoon jets and a cluster of rockets. It's an imposing machine at more than 44 feet (13 meters) long, tapering to a dangerously-sharp point and adorned with stabilising fins. It looks more like a missile than a car.
Bloodhound Chief Executive Richard Noble says the £65 million ($85 million) project is an enormous challenge. "We had no idea of the workload that was actually necessary to get to this stage," he said. "You're asking people to sponsor a project where the outcome is not by any means certain, where the finances are shaky, where the technology wasn't even known."
The Cornwall run is designed to see how the car performs at speed. Various modifications have been made for it to run on tarmac, rather than the desert floor. Most notably, the runway configuration has rubber tires. In the desert, the car will run on solid aluminium tires because rubber will simply disintegrate at 1,000 mph speeds.
The Bloodhound is towed from the hangar to the airstrip.
Despite the remote location and the miserably cloudy weather, 3,500 people have turned up eager to watch. And by mid-afternoon, conditions are right for the run.
Public and press are carefully shepherded onto the airfield into the main viewing areas. The team has a tight window for the show -- it's an active airport, and all flights are grounded for only 90 minutes while the tests take place. There's no room for delays.
A team of engineers push the car into place at one end of the runway, and driver Andy Green gives it a final check. I hear on a nearby radio that he's been given the go ahead to start. I watch Green climb into the cockpit and hear the sound of jet engines starting up. The noise grows louder and louder, and the car slowly pulls away to line up on the runway for the speed run to begin.
The rocket-powered car reaches over 200 mph in the test run.  
There's a moment of quiet and then the rockets fire. A huge cone of flame bursts from the back of the Bloodhound, sending it hurtling down the runway. I try to keep up with its pace with my zoom lens, but it's tricky. I don't know how I'd cope photographing the 1,000 mph run!
The first run is over in a matter of seconds. The car is turned around and it runs again, flying past the crowd with just as much noise and excitement. And then it's over. A whole day's effort, a massive crowd in attendance, media from around the world, all for about 30 seconds of movement. But what a 30 seconds.
The 1.7-mile (2.7km) runway meant the car was only taken to a little over 200 mph, but Green, a Wing Commander in the Royal Air Force, said that was enough to achieve success.
Around 4,000 members of the public came along to watch the speed run.
"This is a car that's designed to cruise supersonic on a 12-mile track in South Africa," he said. "It is not designed to be driven like a drag racing car on a short concrete track at Cornwall airport. Despite that, the car just delivered in spades."
The Bloodhound achieved its 200 mph target speed in just 8 seconds, with an acceleration equivalent to doing 0-60 mph in a regular road car in just two seconds. To give that some context, a Ford Focus will do 0-60 in about 9 seconds, while even the $2.5m Bugatti Chiron takes 2.5 seconds to reach 60 mph.
For Noble, though, the Cornwall run wasn't about numbers. "What was so important about today was the people," he said. "We've got a fantastic turnout of people here and more coming over the weekend. That's all very important as the prime objective of the project is to create a new generation of scientists and engineers and this is clearly what this thing is doing."
Driver Wing Commander Andy Green
It's a sentiment echoed by the aerodynamic designer of Bloodhound. "To see the crowd reaction, and seeing the kids get excited, that's very special," said Ron Ayers. "That is the object, not to break a record -- we already have the record (Ayers worked on the Thrust SSC car, which still holds the record at 763 mph) -- we're doing it to inspire young people and what inspires young people more than high-speed cars!"
Honestly, the day was exciting for me too. 
When I first saw the Bloodhound three years ago, the team was still building it at their production facility in Bristol, England. Back then, the car was a collection of parts. The massive rocket safely stowed in one corner of the building, with the aluminium structures built to hold it laid out nearby. That's why, despite the grey day and a 5 a.m. start, it was amazing to finally see the car in action.

Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi has a list of new rules for employees to follow.
CEO Dara Khosrowshahi unveiled new company rules on Tuesday designed to clean up the startup's workplace culture.
Khosrowshahi said in a LinkedIn post he determined after a few months on the job that the "culture and approach that got Uber where it is today is not what will get us to the next level." Among the eight rules was "We do the right thing. Period."
The new rules are part of Khosrowshahi's attempt to rescue a brand hit hard by a slew of scandals in the past couple of months. Khosrowshahi was appointed in August to fill the post, which had been vacant since co-founder Travis Kalanick was forced out of the job two months earlier.
Among the new rules is "we celebrate differences … we encourage different opinions and approaches to be heard" and "we are customer obsessed. We work tirelessly to earn our customers' trust and business by solving their problems."
Khosrowshahi was hired to right a company rocked by a tumultuous year, one in which its CEO was forced to resign. More than 20 employees were fired after an investigation into sexual harassment allegations. Also, the company is defending itself against a trade-secret theft lawsuit from Waymo, a self-driving car business run by Alphabet, Google's parent company.
An internal investigation led by former US Attorney General Eric Holder looked into systemic discrimination, harassment and retaliation at the San Francisco company. After a monthslong investigation, Holder made 47 recommendations on how to clean up its workplace culture.
Uber's new rules are the result of Holder's recommendation that Uber "reformulate" its 14 cultural values. Up until then, when new hires joined the company, they were asked to subscribe to a unique set of "values." These included meritocracy, toe-stepping, principled confrontation and "always be hustlin'."
Core principles such as being obsessed with customers remained in the rules, while meritocracy, or the philosophy that power is vested in individuals based on their ability and talent, didn't carry over.
"Uber has always been a company that embraces change, and going forward we'll approach our culture in the same way," Khosrowshahi wrote. "We certainly don't expect these norms to change overnight, or every year, but we always want to take stock of who we are, who we want to be, and move accordingly."

This self-driving Lyft car is slated to be hitting San Francisco roads soon.
Self-driving cars are a common sight in Silicon Valley but not something New Yorkers are used to. That could soon change.
Lyft announced Tuesday that it's opening a New York City office and in a hint about what it may be working on, the company said some of its engineers there will be working on its self-driving car tech. The company didn't confirm it's bringing autonomous vehicles to the city, however. 
Lyft is also staffing its New York office with engineers working on infrastructure and marketplace efforts. The ride-hailing company said the diversity of New York's neighborhoods and urban layout make it an ideal place to test out its technology.
"This space makes it possible for us to draw on the incredible pool of talent in NYC to continue improving the experience passengers and drivers across the country have every day," Nancy Losey, Lyft's head of office operations, said in a statement.
Up until a few months ago, Lyft had announced only a handful of partnerships with self-driving companies, like Nutonomy, General Motors and Waymo, the self-driving car unit of Google parent company Alphabet. But in July it said it was starting to work on its own autonomous vehicle software and hardware.
As part of this endeavor, Lyft said, the company was working on opening a new Silicon Valley engineering facility dedicated to autonomous vehicle development. It's since partnered with Drive.ai, a company that makes software for autonomous vehicles, to bring self-driving cars to San Francisco -- though these cars aren't yet on city streets.
Lyft partner Cruise Automation, which is owned by General Motors, announced last month that it's planning to test self-driving cars in New York within the next year.
"Testing in New York will accelerate the timeline to deploying self-driving cars at scale," Kyle Vogt, CEO of Cruise Automation, said at the time. "New York City is one of the most densely populated places in the world and provides new opportunities to expose our software to unusual situations, which means we can improve our software at a much faster rate."

The iPhone 8 Plus has a dual-lens camera, like its predecessor, the 7 Plus. 
An Israeli startup has accused Apple of using its dual-camera technology without permission.
In  a lawsuit, Corephotonics says Apple wasn't authorized to use its patented tech in the iPhone 7 Plus and iPhone 8 Plus. The suit, reported eaerlier by Reuters, was filed in federal court in San Jose on Monday.
The Tel Aviv-based company alleges that it talked to Apple about partnering, but the tech giant ultimately passed on licensing the tech.
"Apple's lead negotiator expressed contempt for Corephotonics' patents, telling [CEO] Dr. Mendlovic and others that even if Apple infringed, it would take years and millions of dollars in litigation before Apple might have to pay something," the complaint says. Corephotonics is seeking damages, but didn't specify an amount. 
Neither Apple nor Corephotonics immediately returned a request for comment.
Apple introduced dual-lens camera tech in its iPhone 7 Plus model last year, but it isn't the only phone maker offering such a setup. Other devices include the Samsung Note 8, the Moto Z2 Force, LG's V30 and the OnePlus 5. And the feature goes back at least as far as 2011, when it was included in the HTC Evo 3D.


Snapchat's growth just slowed to a crawl.
Snap, the company behind the social network, saw daily active users climb by 5 million in the third quarter -- just 3 percent growth from the second quarter and 17 percent from a year ago -- bringing the total to 178 million.
That trails the 300 million daily users on rival Instagram stories. Instagram's parent, Facebook, boasted a year-over-year 16 percent growth rate, but off a base of more than 2 billion users.
Snap takes a huge tumble posting a $443 million loss in the third quarter.
The numbers illustrate the fact that Snapchat still faces stiff competition from Facebook and Instagram. While Snapchat has been successful in attracting younger users, it remains a mystery to a broader audience. Its array of filters and the idea of disappearing messages presents an intimidating barrier for people trying it out. 
On the other hand, Facebook's Instagram Stories continues to grow at an impressive clip. 
"One thing that we have heard over the years is that Snapchat is difficult to understand or hard to use, and our team has been working on responding to this feedback," Snap CEO Evan Spiegel said Tuesday in a prepared statement, adding that the company is planning a redesign to make the application easier to use.
"We don't yet know how the behavior of our community will change when they begin to use our updated application," Spiegel said. "We're willing to take that risk for what we believe are substantial longterm benefits to our business." 
More bad news: Snap also took a $40 million charge to write down unsold Spectacles. Spiegel said the company made the "wrong decision" based on the early sales traction. "We're learning from it and plan to avoid a similar mistake in the future," he said during an earnings call with analysts.
The company reported a loss of $443.2 million, or 36 cents a share. Excluding one-time items, Snap lost 14 cents a share, narrower than the average analyst estimate of a loss of 15 cents a share, according to Yahoo Finance. 
A year ago, the company lost $124.2 million, or 15 cents a share.
Snap's revenue rose more than 60 percent, to $207.9 million, but still fell far below analysts' expectations of $239.5 million. Despite that, Spiegel said the company now reaches 70 percent of the key 13- to 34-year-old population in the US, UK, France and Australia.
"Our audience may not be the largest today, but we feel that it is the most strategic, and that's a really strong base to grow from," he said. "We're not afraid to make changes in the best interest of growing the user base."
Last month, research firm eMarketer anticipated Snap's global advertising revenue would hit $774.1 million this year, markedly down from its previous estimate of $900 million. However, eMarketer expects revenue to grow about 90 percent to $1.47 billion in 2018.
"Despite all of its improvements in ad products and measurement, Snapchat remains in the experimental bucket for many marketers," the firm said. "They give it high marks for its creative possibilities and its ability to attract a youth audience, but many have yet to make it a must-buy."
Meanwhile, Snap's stock remains well below its post-initial public offering peak price of $29.44 as shares have declined nearly 40 percent since going public. Shares fell more than 18 percent to $12.40 in after-hours trading.

European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager on stage at Web Summit in Lisbon, Portugal.
European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager isn't known for giving Silicon Valley companies an easy ride.
Under her leadership, the Competition Commission last year ruled that Apple owed Ireland $14.5 billion in back taxes. And earlier this year, it came down hard on Google, fining the company $2.7 billion over its online shopping results.
By prioritizing its own shopping comparisons in search results and pushing competitors back to page four, Google denied consumers a choice of shopping services, the commission decided.
"How many of you would like to find your companies on page four of search results?" Vestager asked the audience during a talk Tuesday at Web Summit in Lisbon, Portugal. Unsurprisingly, no one raised a hand.
Vestager offered a simple suggestion to tech companies looking to operate in Europe: show your trustworthiness by abiding by its rules. 
That sounds obvious, but tech companies have struggled to do so, with giants like Google, Microsoft and Apple getting into hot water with the EU. 
It isn't necessarily about how powerful a company is, Vestager said, but whether a company is using its power to engage in anticompetitive practices. 
"We have no objection to Google dominating the market with its search engine. We just don't want it to use that dominance to squeeze out competition," Vestager said. A lack of competition, she said, can "end up closing the door to innovation. Companies like Google have a responsibility because they hold all these powers."
Google didn't reply to a request for comment on Vestager's remarks, but the company did respond in September to the EU's decision by opening up shopping spots to rivals. Vestager will continue to meet with Google and its competitors to judge whether the search giant is doing enough.
Vestager's scrutiny has also landed on Apple, because of the company's tax practices in Ireland. Coming down hard on tax issues isn't just about making an example of companies that benefit from creative accounting, she said. "It's important for Europeans to know that value created in Europe is taxed in Europe."
This weekend's revelations in the Paradise Papers suggested Apple moved money to the Channel Islands off the coast of England to avoid paying more tax in Ireland, but Vestager said the EU was already on the case.
"We have taken an interest in getting to know how Apple is organized now, and we did that before the papers," she said. The commission hasn't spoken to Apple since the publication of the papers, she said, adding that it's too early to decide whether to launch the commission's own investigation on the subject.
Apple rebutted the Paradise Papers report in a lengthy response posted on its site. And CEO Tim Cook dismissed last year's Competition Commission ruling as "political crap."
Vestager said she hasn't stopped to consider how Silicon Valley giants might view her as a result of her and the commission's decisions, but she said she hoped all companies would aim to respect legislation and, in so doing, respect their customers.
Companies have to put fairness and trust at the core of their business, she said, to ensure "society (is)  served by technology and not the other way around."
"It is important for any company to respect the rules of the game," she said.

Technically Incorrect offers a slightly twisted take on the tech that's taken over our lives.
He has better things to do with his hands than hold a phone.
You can't just sit there.
If you have a phone to sell, especially a new one, you have to at least try and capture some attention. Even though it seems that Apple's iPhone X is the only phone in Mediatown right now.
On Sunday, Samsung chose to celebrate the iPhone X launch with an ad mocking the last 10 years of the iPhone.
Google waited until Monday to release a new ad that had a little more decorum, suggesting its Pixel 2 phone was simply more phone than any other.
The ad is a quite magical portrayal of just how lazy humanity has become.
People seem to want their phones to do everything for them. And, with a phone that has superior AI at its core, the Pixel 2 seems well positioned to fulfill our pretensions to an absolutely sloth-like future. 
Here we have attractive young humans desperately wanting their phone to tell them if they need an umbrella. Because looking through a window is just so 20th century.
Then there are those who can't be bothered to press a button to take a selfie. They just want to order their phone to do it for them.
Talking of orders, the Pixel can also order you a sandwich. This allows you to simply not move at all.
Naturally, the ad pauses halfway through to make an Apple joke -- the standard Android one about the alleged lack of infinite photo storage on an iPhone. 
The whole effect is very fetching. 
However, Google hasn't yet mastered the logistical issues that come with launching a new phone.
In my own visits to both a Verizon store and a Best Buy, I didn't find salespeople even wanting me to be excited by the Pixel 2. At Best Buy, there was only one Pixel 2 I could even look at and that was in a locked cupboard.
Moreover, there have been some very basic snafus. Sending customers Pixel 2's that didn't have an operating system, for example. Then there were the screen burn-in issues suffered by the Pixel 2 XL, which caused by colleague Lynn La to amend her review in a slightly less enthusiastic direction. (Apple has also admitted its iPhone X may have screen-burn problems)
Google didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.
Still, the company says it's committed to hardware and must do what it can to make it seem desirable. Hardware is extremely difficult. Why, according to Samsung, Apple hasn't managed to get it right once in 10 years.

Airbnb's headquarters, pictured here, are in San Francisco where it's partnering with the city's largest residential landlord. 
Once a foe to landlords, Airbnb is now working with some of them.
The home rental site announced Sunday that it's partnered with San Francisco's largest residential landlord, Veritas Investments. The idea is to let tenants in Veritas buildings list their apartments on Airbnb for short-term rentals and then share the profit with their landlord.
"Veritas is a leader and innovator in the real estate community," Jaja Jackson, Airbnb's director of global multi-family housing partnerships, said in a statement.
In just under a decade, Airbnb has gone from a website for couch surfers to having a massive online presence. It lists millions of homes for short-term rentals in almost every country on Earth. That growth, however, has come with challenges.
The company has waged extended battles with landlords, regulators and housing advocates in major cities around the world, including San Francisco, New York, Paris, Berlin and Barcelona. So, over the past year, the company has been working to make nice with lawmakers and landlords.
Many landlords don't allow tenants to sublet their apartments on Airbnb. That's because it typically comes with more risk and no profit for them. But, increasingly, Airbnb is working with landlords on profit-sharing deals. The company announced a partnership with a major landlord in Florida last month that's similar to its Veritas deal. 
As for Veritas, it will initially let tenants in five of its buildings list their apartments on Airbnb. The landlord will get 10 percent of that short-term rental profit and said it will put some of the money back into the building for upgrades and program oversight. Veritas owns more than 200 buildings in San Francisco.
Along with Veritas, Airbnb also announced Sunday that it's partnering with tech startup Pillow. Pillow aims to make it easier for people to rent out homes on Airbnb. The company has tools like an "online dashboard" that gives people information on a building's specs and prices for short-term rentals in a certain neighborhood. Under the new partnership, Pillow will be available to people living in Veritas buildings.
"We reached out to and surveyed residents, and there's a great deal of interest in this new aspect of the 'sharing economy,'" Yat-Pang Au, Veritas CEO, said in a statement. "Airbnb and Pillow can help our residents with economic empowerment and could further differentiate our properties."
Airbnb has partnered with other landlords in similar deals under an initiative it started a year ago called "Friendly Buildings Program." Like the Veritas partnership, landlords who join this program allow tenants to rent out their apartments on a short-term basis for a cut of the profit. So far, landlords across the US and in Canada have enrolled more than 13,000 units in the Friendly Buildings Program.

Life, disrupted: In Europe, millions of refugees are still searching for a safe place to settle. Tech should be part of the solution. But is it?


With technology increasingly intertwined with all aspects of business, CNET@Work can help you -- from prosumers to small businesses with fewer than five employees -- get started.
With more entrepreneurs opening small and home-based businesses, questions about taxes and taxation are inevitable. This primer aims to provide some answers. However, you should consult your tax advisor on your specific situation.
There have to be some tax advantages to compensate for the risk of opening a home-based business, right? In addition, there are pitfalls to avoid, guidelines to follow and things to know in order to keep you out of the Internal Revenue Service's crosshairs.
(In addition, tax reform may be the horizon. But as of this writing, there are not enough details known to make any determination of the potential impacts.)
If you don't want a negative tax-time surprise, include the amount of self-employed tax owed in your quarterly estimated tax payments.
Depending on how your business is organized, if you are a sole proprietor, or LLC, then you are responsible for self-employment tax. Unlike those employed by others and paid as employees, the self-employed are responsible for what is in essence double FICA and Medicare taxes.
As an employee, you have likely noticed the 7.65 percent that is deducted from your paycheck: 6.2 percent for Social Security and 1.45 percent for Medicare, which maxes out at $7,886.40 in 2017 on earnings of $127,200. Your employer pays the same amount on your behalf. The self-employed, however are both the employee and employer, and pay both halves, for a maximum of $19,461.60.
Those caught unaware of this can be whipsawed at tax time. Since many self-employed do not draw an actual paycheck, and thus taxes are not withheld, it is easy to lose sight of this liability until tax-filing season, which can make for an awful shock to the wallet.
For example, if your business earns $100,000 and you are considered self-employed, the self-employment tax alone would be $15,200. That does not include income taxes. The remedy, especially if you don't want a negative tax-time surprise, and potential IRS underpayment penalties, is to include the amount of self-employed tax owed in your quarterly estimated tax payments.
Some of this double taxation can be offset due to the fact that the self-employed are able to deduct 50 percent of the self-employed tax they pay from their income. In the 25 percent income tax bracket in the above example, that would equate to a $1,900 reduction in federal income tax -- better than nothing.
There are several retirement options open to small businesses.
As a self-employed business owner, if you don't have access to a spouse's health insurance plan, you're on your own to obtain coverage. Health insurance markets have changed dramatically in the last decade. With the advent of the Affordable Care Act in 2010, private insurance as we once knew it no longer exists. 
The bad news: Insurance plans -- which no longer allow consumers to pick and choose what is covered (such as maternity care, mental health or a "free" preventative visit) -- can be much more expensive. Here's what hasn't changed: The self-employed still can deduct their health insurance premiums, much like the self-employment tax deduction.
One of the issues we all face is saving for retirement. One of the many risks for the self-employed comes with leaving the sometimes comfortable confines of the corporate world, where you are able to contribute $18,000 to your company's 401K plan (plus $6,000 if over age 50), and more than likely have a portion of that matched by the employer.
There are several options open to small businesses. Perhaps the best and most flexible is the Self Employed 401K Plan, also known as the Solo 401K. This option is for employers with no additional employees other than the owner and spouse. It is not subject to the rather stringent requirement that traditional 401K plans must adhere to and are easy to set up.
Many providers have a very streamlined process making it easy to start such a plan. From there, the business owner wears two hats:
Total maximum contribution, including "employee" and "employer" contribution for 2017, is $54,000 for those under age 50, and $60,000 for those 50 and over.
The record keeping and administrative burdens of such a plan are light. Once the plan's assets reach $250,000, form 5500-EZ must be filed with the IRS. However, just like the rest of this, it is a "simple" form to fill out, and should not take more than 10 minutes.
Last but not least, the Solo 401K plan is available in both ROTH and traditional tax-deductible forms.
You can deduct quite a bit as a small business owner. 
The truth is, there's quite a bit that you can deduct as a small business owner. If you're a sole proprietor, or have formed a limited liability company (or LLC), you or your tax professional will likely file a Schedule C (Profit or Loss From Business-Sole Proprietorship). If your total business expenses are less than $5,000, you can use schedule C-EZ.
Here, you will list your revenue and expenses, which can run the gamut from advertising to office expenses, supplies, repairs and maintenance, travel, deductible meals and entertainment, legal and professional services, utilities, taxes and licenses, and rent, among other categories. There's also an "other category" where small business owners will expense items such as subscriptions, telephone and internet expenses, and perhaps additional items, depending on the nature of their business.
There's quite a bit of speculation and often questions among small business owners as to what they can and cannot deduct. In a nutshell, legitimate business expenses must be:
Depending on the type of business you operate, you will likely have to purchase equipment. This could include everything from a computer, monitors, laptop, printer, desks, tables, chairs and the list goes on. While larger businesses typically depreciate these assets over time, essentially claiming a small piece of the cost each year based on the useful life of the asset, small businesses can essentially expense these assets for tax purposes in the year they're purchased.
See also: How to calculate depreciation on computer hardware: The smart person's guide
Termed "Section 179" depreciation, there is a generous limit, up to $500,000 per year. So if you purchase a laptop for $2,000 that is used solely for business purposes, rather than depreciating it over its useful life (determined by the IRS to be five years), which itself would allow a $400 deduction, you can deduct the entire $2,000 in the year of purchase. This provides a tax incentive for small businesses to purchase equipment. The tax savings can be considerable; remember the 15.2 percent self-employment tax mentioned previously? That's calculated after expenses.
Not to worry: If there are assets used for both business and personal reasons -- called "mixed-use assets" -- you can still take a partial deduction, based on the percentage of business use. These can include that laptop that you use half the time for business, as well as a portion of your internet and phone bills.
If an area of your home is used exclusively for your business, you may be eligible for the home office deduction.
In addition, that can include expenses for the business use of your car, via a standard mileage rate (currently $0.535 per mile), or the actual expenses of repairs, gasoline, maintenance and repairs, even if it is used primarily for personal use (deductions will be prorated). As in all aspects of running a small business, maintaining impeccable records is an absolute must. For example, for deductible mileage, you need to maintain a record of the odometer reading at start and finish, date, place and purpose of the trip. Commuting miles if applicable are not deductible.
This is one of the trickier areas in terms of small business taxation, and subject to considerable scrutiny. The bottom line is that if an area of your home is used exclusively for your business, you may be eligible for the home office deduction. However, unlike other assets (the PC described earlier, half used for business, half personal) this designated space -- to qualify for the deduction -- cannot be of mixed-use.
Even if you are using a small space -- for example, what used to be a spare 12-foot by 12-foot bedroom -- exclusively for your business, you can get some tax benefits by writing it off. From there, you will have another decision: whether to use the Regular Method or Simplified Option.

This allows you to use the actual expenses associated with using the office, including mortgage interest, utilities, insurance, repairs and other costs, as well as depreciation. Essentially, all of the costs are prorated based on the square footage of the office relative to that of the entire home. In the case of items such as mortgage interest and real estate taxes, the amount associated with the rest of your home (all but the business space) are still reported on Schedule A (Itemized Deductions).
As the name suggests, calculations are much simpler in figuring the deduction; $5 per square foot up to maximum of 300 square feet or $1,500 deduction. There's no need to do any other calculations, unless you want to determine which method provides the higher deduction.
Here's another thing to be aware of that many small home-based business owners may not know: If you use the regular method, and take depreciation, the total amount will be recaptured when you sell the home, which will reduce your cost basis, and could result in capital gains, depending on the sales price relative to the cost basis. Generous exclusions of capital gains on the sale of a qualifying primary home ($250,000 single, $500,000 married) may provide adequate cover for this, but all situations are different.
You can expense the cost of transportation including airfare, car rental, parking and so on, plus hotel and lodging costs, and other associated expenses. If a trip is personal and business, be careful; you can only deduct what is attributable to business.
Just 50 percent of qualifying meal and entertainment costs are deductible. You can deduct the cost of business-related meals and entertainment with clients, as well as your meals while attending conferences, or on business-related trips. Maintain accurate, detailed records -- for meals with clients, keep dates, who attended and location. It is always wise to keep receipts.
Accurate record-keeping is a must in all aspects of running your business. Maintain a receipt file, and err on the side of caution when it comes to keeping or ditching receipts, or other records. In addition, it is wise to consider using accounting software (such as QuickBooks), or hiring someone to manage your books.
Finally, consider working with a tax professional who knows the ins and outs of small businesses and personal taxes. When you own a small business, your personal and business taxes are likely intertwined. While accurate tax preparation is extremely important, it is a backward-looking event. Tax planning, which should begin each year on Jan. 1, is forward-looking, and can help you make the most out of your personal and business tax situation.

The tiny island of Jersey in the English Channel has reportedly become a tax haven for companies like Apple. 
Apple's tax practices are back in the spotlight.
A new report from the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists and its media partners says Apple sought out a new location to store its overseas cash to avoid paying higher taxes. The findings, part of a leak of documents dubbed the "Paradise Papers," say the company chose the tiny island of Jersey in the English Channel to store its over $250 billion in cash. The island charges no tax on companies' profits, ICIJ reported.
"Jersey was to play a significant role in Apple's newly configured Irish tax structure set up in late 2014," the publication said. "Under this arrangement, the MacBook-maker has continued to enjoy ultra-low tax rates on most of its profits and now holds much of its non-US earnings in a $252 billion mountain of cash offshore."
The Paradise Papers records come from the internal files of offshore law firm Appleby and corporate services provider Estera. German newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung received the documents and shared them with ICIJ and its media partners, including The New York Times, Australia's ABC, the BBC in the United Kingdom, Le Monde in France and CBC in Canada. The partnership mirrors the treatment of 2015's Panama Papers leak. 
CNET is unable to verify whether the documents are real or have been altered.
Apple, in a lengthy statement in its online newsroom, refuted the Paradise Papers report. It said the changes it made to its corporate structure in 2015 were done to "preserve its tax payments to the United States, not to reduce its taxes anywhere else." It said it didn't move operations or investments from Ireland and that its "effective tax rate on foreign earnings" is 21 percent. 
"Apple believes every company has a responsibility to pay its taxes, and as the largest taxpayer in the world, Apple pays every dollar it owes in every country around the world," the company said in its nearly 1,200-word online response. "The changes we made did not reduce our tax payments in any country."
Apple is one of many US technology companies that have benefited from stashing cash overseas. That maneuver lets the companies avoid paying hefty taxes they could face by bringing the cash back to the US. In Apple's case, it held its cash in Ireland to pay a much smaller tax rate than the 35 percent level in the US. 
But Apple has come under fire both in the US and the European Union for its tax practices. CEO Tim Cook appeared before Congress in early 2013 to defend Apple's strategy of holding most of its cash in Ireland. 
Apple CEO Tim Cook in May 2013 testified before Congress about his company's tax practices.
The EU, meanwhile, believed Ireland wasn't collecting enough taxes and instead gave companies like Apple too big of a break on Ireland's already low 12.5 percent tax rate. The selective treatment allowed Apple to pay an effective corporate tax rate of 1 percent on European profits in 2003, according to the commission last year. In 2014, Apple paid a tax rate of 0.005 percent. As a result, the EU slapped Apple with a $14.5 billion tax bill in mid-2016. 
According to the documents leaked in the Paradise Papers, Apple started looking for a new place to store its cash in early 2014 as Ireland moved to change its corporate tax law. 
"The company appeared to be on the lookout for a country in which nothing at all would get in the way of business," said Süddeutsche Zeitung. "A place with no state interference, no politics and no public scrutiny."
The paper reported Apple, with the help of law firm Appleby, chose Jersey for its 0 percent corporate tax rate. Appleby listed two Apple subsidiaries as based in Jersey, starting in 2015. 
As of the end of September, Apple had $268.9 billion in cash, with the vast majority of that held overseas. Last week, Cook, in a TV interview, again called for a tax reform that would let him bring the cash back to the US without facing a huge tax bill.

Maresca in the corner office he's occupied since 2005. 
When Bob Maresca, the president of Bose since 2005, assumed the CEO position after company founder Amar Bose died in 2013, the company never sent out a press release to announce his promotion. And it isn't going to send one out to announce that Maresca is stepping down as CEO on Dec. 31, when he will hand the stewardship of the company to President Phil Hess, who will add CEO to his title.
"It's not really our way," a Bose PR rep once explained to me when I asked about the quiet executive shuffles.
But even if that remains the case, Maresca, 62, who has been at Bose for 31 years and will remain chairman of Bose's board and a trustee of the corporation, wanted the world to know about the transition.
"I don't want people to think I just disappeared," said Maresca, who sat down with CNET for a recent breakfast interview in Brooklyn, where he grew up. "For years and years our strategy was don't say anything, we're privately held, we don't have to disclose anything. And that was fine for many years. But people want to know the companies they're doing business with these days."
At Bose HQ in Framingham, Massachusetts, the news has been out of the bag for a while. Back in June, Maresca sent a long, personal memo to employees explaining his decision to retire at the end of the year. He'd been thinking about it for a couple of years and had put a succession plan in place.
Maresca never aspired to reach the "corner office," so when he became President and CEO, it exceeded every professional expectation he had, he told employees. And while it afforded him things "he never imagined," he noted that without his family, "that wouldn't matter."
"I want to devote more time and attention to my parents, and to the people who matter most to me," he wrote. "With God's grace, I now have that chance. I'm going to take it."
He also said he wants to volunteer more -- he's been involved with the Ron Burton Training Village in Hubbardston, Massachusetts, a training center for disadvantaged kids. "Giving back can sound cliche, but for me, there's nothing else quite like it," he wrote.
Phil Hess is a longtime Bose veteran who will take the CEO position as of Jan. 1, 2018.
One of his hobbies is using his engineering background to build devices for people with physical disabilities, "so they can do more and experience more." He plans to devote more time to that, too.
This may sound like the stuff of the Boy Scouts, but after having many conversations with Maresca over the years, it's not surprising to hear him frame his retirement in these terms -- and on his terms.
"The company is kind of a bunch of Boy Scouts," Maresca told me. "We want to do the right thing. We want to make good products for people and we're working hard on things like sleep and hearing and I feel really good about where the company is now. 
"Four years ago we were heavily entrenched in baby boomers and our whole operations were optimized to serve those baby boomers who had Lifestyle and Wave systems," he said, referring to the home theater and tabletop radio products for which -- with the possible exception of its noise-cancelling headphones -- the Bose brand was arguably most famous. "So we shifted our products more toward mill--" he stopped to catch himself. "No, not millennials, but people with mobile lifestyles who, yes, tend to be Gen Xers and millennials."
It was a difficult change to make, he said. The company was shifting to lower-margin, mass-market products and moving away from a direct-sales approach with print ads produced in-house and a big telemarketing staff to support the business model. The whole operation had to change to serve the new business and lots of jobs had to be eliminated.
"That was really painful," Maresca said. "Those folks in direct marketing were responsible for me being successful when I was in the noise-cancelling division."
With the restructuring now fully realized, Maresca felt it was a good time to turn over the reins to Hess, who Maresca hired back in 1996 to work on Bose's active-suspension vehicle system, which was a technical success but a commercial failure.
Hess went on to work with Maresca in Bose's noise-cancelling and home entertainment divisions. He's been running the latter division of the company since 2006.
"You know, the first consumer noise-cancelling headphone wasn't a noise-cancelling headphone that was sold to the general public," Maresca said. "It was one that American Airlines provided to first-class customers."
Maresca said that Hess negotiated the deal with American, which was skeptical about the upside of buying reusable $220 headphones (that had to be cleaned after each flight), after buying disposable headphones for 78 cents apiece. The noise-cancelling headphones turned out to be a big hit with passengers. 
"Phil is a very pragmatic guy," Maresca said. "We [Bose] used to be pretty arrogant and tell customers what they wanted and sometimes we didn't pay attention to competitors. Phil uses data. He looks at what our competitors are doing -- not to copy them but at least be aware of what's out there. And looks at customers and what their needs are. He's a very capable guy, a high integrity guy.
"Change is always tough for people," he said. "But the transition is going well. They know I'm not going anywhere too far away. And I wouldn't feel comfortable leaving if I didn't think the company was on a really good path."

Hungry? Better get used to eating bugs, the outgoing leader of tech giant Cisco says.
"The primary source of protein you will be having within your life, definitely within 20 years and maybe within 15, will be insects," said John Chambers, speaking at Half Moon Bay at the Techonomy conference. They're "the cleanest form you can produce at least challenge to the environment."
In particular, he thinks eating crickets is the cat's pajamas. That view aligns well with companies like Aspire Food Group, which grows crickets for human consumption, and many cultures in Asia, Africa and Latin America. So perhaps you'd better embrace an insectivorous diet.
Former Cisco chief Jon Chambers, speaking at Techonomy, predicts insects will be our main protein source.
Chambers was for years chief executive of networking giant Cisco Systems, but now he's severing his last tie as the company's board chairman. So what makes him such an expert in food technology? In short, he plans to get more active with startups, and he's paying close attention to what's going on.
Growing crickets is a high-tech operation, he says, with robots able to help crickets grow 50 percent bigger in a third the time as usual, he said.
Chambers likes the prospects of Aspire Food Group, based in Austin, Texas, and says cricket food is ready now. He's also an investor in the food company and mentor to CEO Mohammed Ashour, a spokesman for Aspire confirmed. 
You won't necessarily know you're eating leggy little arthropods, though, since they can be ground up and added into other foods. He just had a seven-course dinner at a San Francisco restaurant, Saison, with crickets infused into biscuits, desserts and even a margarita.
Chambers likes startups, but he's worried about them in the United States. France and China are doing a better job encouraging them and ensuring they're not isolated to urban coastal pockets.
Aspire grows its crickets in bins. Automated robots handle the feeding.
"We've become the worst," Chambers said.
And startup hotbed Silicon Valley is too complacent, he added.
"When a region is out of touch with technology or business or social changes, you're at risk," Chambers said. "Boston's Route 128 used to be the high-tech center of the world," near MIT and Harvard and home to 2,000 or 3,000 high-tech companies. But the area missed the move to personal computers, software and the internet and lost its position of influence.
"Silicon Valley has the risk we could miss major market transitions," Chambers said.
Update, 1:55 p.m. PT: Adds more background on Chambers and Aspire.

Technically Incorrect offers a slightly twisted take on the tech that's taken over our lives.
This is the look for all iPhone X aficionados. You didn't know?
You didn't think that Samsung was going to let the iPhone X party go on without at least trying to turn the music down, did you?
Periodically, Samsung has enjoyed cocking a snook at what it sees is Apple's lateness to almost every cellphone party going. And then there's all that painful Apple cult behavior. Once the Church of Appleology gets a grip on you, it's hard to break free.
On Sunday, therefore, the Korean phone maker released an ad that suggested the iPhone has been a retrograde product for the last 10 years.
Just, you know, to celebrate the arrival of the latest late phone, the X.
Here, we stroll through phone history, since the first iPhone launched.
It's all seen through the eyes of an Apple fanperson who just hasn't seen the light for so many years, even when it was shining right into his eyes.
The iPhone struggled with storage capabilities and the lack of a stylus and a big screen. For the longest time, it wasn't water-resistant.
Even the woman whom our hero adores had a Samsung Galaxy, while he still labored in his love for the iPhone.
Then Apple made it worse when the iPhone 7 came along. It forced him to use dongles -- those extra bits that you'll use, lose and spend even more money replacing.
His lover had wireless charging. The Apple fanperson had, well, cables and dongles.
Finally, in 2017, he understands that love means getting the same phone as the one who makes your heart beat faster and lives life dongle-free.
At last he's a happy man. He walks along the street, as his former cult members wait in line for the iPhone X.
One of those waiting has, oh, a haircut shaped like the iPhone X's infamous notch -- the unsightly black bar at the top of the screen.
Goodness, does he look silly.
Our man walks on. He's finally free from the Appleology cult. He has finally, the ad wants you to believe, grown up.
Apple didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.
Of course, Samsung has cherry-picked the moments that suit it best here. Still, many have felt that Apple waits to see how others implement new technology and then "perfects" it.
"Upgrade to Galaxy," says the ad. I fear, though, that relatively few these days switch from one ecosystem to another. That's certainly been the opinion of those phone salespeople I've recently talked to.
The reviews for iPhone X have largely been gushing. The lines to get one were long, at least in most places.
Which means that Samsung simply wants to make sure you won't forget it, as the hype springs eternal for its rival.
"The Church of Appleology is a con," Samsung pleads at the street corner.
How many, though, can really be saved?

"The Inspection Chamber" puts you into the story.
The BBC has launched its first interactive audio story called "The Inspection Chamber."
Available now to Amazon Alexa users, "The Inspection Chamber" is a sci-fi comedy that requires the listener to use his or her voice to play one of the characters and influence the plot.
The story starts with a computer called Dave explaining that two scientists are about to inspect you in order to determine what kind of creature you are. The answers you provide will directly influence the story, which has multiple endings, so it may be worth going through this a couple of times if you want to hear every scenario.
George Wright, head of internet research and future services for the BBC, calls "The Inspection Chamber" an experimental first step. 
"They're not just a listener anymore," Wright said. "They have an active role in the story, playing the fourth character in a radio play which puts them in the heart of the action." 
The story was developed by BBC Research & Development in collaboration with production company Rosina Sound and will be coming to other platforms in the future.  


T-Mobile CEO John Legere. T-Mobile and Sprint have put the kibosh on their merger.
Sprint and T-Mobile have nixed their merger.
In a brief joint statement Saturday, the companies said they were "unable to find mutually agreeable terms."
The move wasn't a surprise. A Monday report by Japanese publication Nikkei said Sprint's parent company, Japan-based carrier SoftBank, planned to break off merger talks because of a dispute over ownership of the combined company.
The report said SoftBank and T-Mobile's parent company, German carrier Deutsche Telekom, had reached a broad agreement but hadn't settled on who would control the merged entity. Deutsche Telekom reportedly had insisted on a controlling stake, something SoftBank initially was open to but then reconsidered, Nikkei said. Deutsche Telekom declined to comment on that report, and SoftBank didn't respond to a request for comment.
On Sunday, Softbank said it plans to increase its ownership stake in Sprint.
""We are entering an era where billions of new connected devices and sensors will come online throughout the United States," Softbank CEO Masayoshi Son said in a statement. "Continuing to own a world class mobile network is central to our vision of ubiquitous connectivity."
A possible merger between T-Mobile and Sprint had been rumored for years. The two companies lag behind their bigger rivals, Verizon Wireless and AT&T, when it comes to the US market. Combining would give them an advantage, but critics fear having three players would reduce competition and hurt consumers.
Sprint and T-Mobile both said Saturday that they had no additional comment to make about the end of the merger talks.
On Sunday, Sprint announced a mobile networking agreement with broadband provider Altice USA

 Actor Jared Leto during a visit to the SiriusXM Studios in New York City in September.
Jared Leto is known to many as an Oscar-winning actor, but he's also a longtime tech investor who regularly cold calls perspective companies he's thinking of investing in.
Leto, who won a Best Supporting Actor Academy Award for his role in the 2013 movie "Dallas Buyers Club," most recently appeared in "Blade Runner 2049" and is the lead singer of the band, Thirty Seconds to Mars. He is also a familiar face in Silicon Valley, thanks to his investments in such startups as Spotify, Uber and Airbnb.
When it comes to investing, Leto looks for "companies that are changing the way that we behave, founders or CEOs that are incredibly passionate, smart geniuses," Leto said Wednesday during an onstage interview at the Wall Street Journal's D.Luxe fashion and technology conference.
Leto's interest in tech stems from his experience years ago with his band, which grew in popularity as Napster users shared its music on the now-defunct peer-to-peer network. He said his band was also one of the first itself online.
"When you're a musician, you have to become a digital expert or you die," Leto said.  
While Leto's portfolio includes a stable of successful startups, he's not without tales of missed opportunities. He said he met with Instagram four days before Facebook announced it was purchasing the photo-sharing site in 2012.
"They all had huge smiles on their faces," he said. "I thought, 'Wow, the culture here must be amazing.'"

Sen. John McCain is co-sponsoring the Honest Ads Act.
Some US senators are looking to beef up laws around political ads that appear online, given apparent Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election.
It's largely believed the election was at least partially swayed by bogus political ads on Facebook, Twitter and Google. Democratic Sens. Mark Warner of Virginia and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota are teaming up with Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona on the Honest Ads Act to try to stop future interference.
According to a preview of the act seen by Axios, the bill would amend the current Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 to include paid internet and digital advertisements. 
"In 2016 Russians bought online political ads designed to influence our election and divide Americans," reads a statement from Klobuchar and Warner. "The content and purchaser(s) of those online advertisements are a mystery to the public because of outdated laws that have failed to keep up with evolving technology."
The Honest Ads Act  would create the same rules for online political ads that already cover ads sold on TV and radio. That means certain disclosures would be required, such as who paid for the ads.
It would require online platforms, such as Facebook, "to make reasonable efforts to ensure that foreign individuals and entities are not purchasing political advertisements in order to influence the American electorate." 
Facebook, Google and Twitter have acknowledged that more could have been done to prevent the placement of such ads on their sites. Facebook has said that more than $100,000 worth of ads were bought by what now appear to be Russian agents, while Twitter said it's discovered 201 accounts that may be tied to those same agents. Google also reportedly found that Russians paid for tens of thousands of dollars on ads on YouTube, Gmail and Google search.
Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg said last week that the company intends to fully cooperate with Congress, as well as release information on how the ads were targeted to specific audiences.
"Things happened on our platform in this election that should not have happened," Sandberg said. "We know we have a responsibility to do anything we can to prevent that."
Other Facebook executives are also speaking up.
"We stand with lawmakers in their effort to achieve transparency in political advertising. We have already announced the steps Facebook will take on our own and we look forward to continuing the conversation with lawmakers as we work toward a legislative solution," Erin Egan, Facebook's vice president for US Public Policy, said in a statement to CNET. 
A Twitter spokeswoman said that "we look forward to engaging with Congress and the [Federal Election Commission] on these issues." 
McCain and Google did not respond to a request for comment.


Jenny Lee spoke about the fate of some companies with $1 billion valuations.
Dead unicorns.
That's what venture capitalist Jenny Lee, managing partner of GGV Capital, thinks is in store for some of the startups that have managed to hit a $1 billion valuation -- known as unicorns.
"2017 will see multiple unicorns die," Lee said during a panel at The Wall Street Journal's tech conference Wednesday.
Discussion with fellow panelists Sam Altman, president of startup accelerator Y Combinator and Bill Maris, who leads venture capital fund Section 32, turned toward the idea of a mellowing in Silicon Valley. Altman said most companies are worth less than their valuations -- although those high valuations could be worth it if another Facebook turns up. 
Already, new unicorns are becoming less frequent. Back in 2015, VC money was flowing more freely. In the third quarter of that year alone, 25 companies reached a $1 billion valuation.
Since then, caution's been the name of the game in Silicon Valley. A year later, in October 2016, VC funding hit a two-year low.  
The one upside: Dying unicorns could show tech isn't in a bubble, Altman said.
Lee thinks consolidation of services will be partly responsible for the disappearance of unicorns.
"The ones that can make it, I think will be magic," she said.

Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg
Facebook is under scrutiny from US Reps. Keith Ellison and John Conyers. 
The two Democrats wrote a letter to the social media company on Wednesday asking that it update its policies regarding hate speech. They also asked Facebook to clarify who buys ads on its site and to make all Facebook ads publicly available.
Ellison of Minnesota and Conyers of Michigan wrote that they are "concerned that Facebook allowed advertisers to target people who expressed interest in the topics of 'Jew-hater' and 'How to burn jews.'"
"Allowing for the spread of violent and hateful ideologies on Facebook, a network with nearly 2 billion unique users, poses a grave threat to not only our most marginalized and threatened communities, but to our entire civil society," they wrote.
Facebook defines hate speech as attacks on people based on their race, sexual orientation and/or other "protected characteristics." The company has said it grapples with tens of thousands of hateful posts per week and depends on its billions of users to report any posts that may violate its rules.
Ellison and Conyers said Facebook's current policies regarding hate speech are "troubling."
"While it earned revenue by letting advertisers target individuals who shared vile anti-Semitic statements, it was also banning Black women who spoke out against racism," they wrote.
The congressmen were referring to an incident when activist and writer Ijeoma Oluo's Facebook account was suspended after she posted a series of screenshots of threatening and racist messages she'd received. Facebook later reinstated her account. It appears that wasn't an isolated incident, according to TechCrunch. Several other black activists have reported similar occurrences.
In their letter, Ellison and Conyers sent Facebook a number of questions involving how it identifies hate speech and what it does to prevent its spread on its advertising platform. They also asked that Facebook detail any changes it recently made to its policies.
Facebook didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

Regina Dugan will be stepping down from her role at Facebook to pursue a new endeavor.
After 18 months leading Facebook's research and development arm Building 8, Regina Dugan announced that she'll be stepping down early next year.
In a post on her Facebook page, Dugan wrote, "Today I am announcing that early next year, I will be leaving Facebook to focus on building and leading a new endeavor."
Dugan has a history of leading secretive technology focused initiatives. She was the head of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) that develops emerging technology for military applications. Just before joining Facebook, Dugan led Google's Advanced Technology and Projects (ATAP) team that worked on the Project Ara modular phone.
In Dugan's post, she quoted President John F. Kennedy's inaugural address.
Today I am announcing that early next year, I will be leaving Facebook to focus on building and leading a new endeavor....

Alphabet, Google's parent company, will be developing 3.3 million acres along the waterfront of Lake Ontario for its Sidewalk Labs initiative.
Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced Tuesday in Toronto that Google's parent company, Alphabet, will develop a portion of the waterfront along Lake Ontario. The development will house Sidewalk Labs, a unit of Alphabet focused on innovation in urban environments.
"This project offers unprecedented opportunities for Canadian innovators and will create thousands of good, middle class jobs," Trudeau said during the announcement alongside Toronto Mayor John Tory and Alphabet Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt.
According to The Globe and Mail, Google's Canadian headquarters will be relocating to the 12-acre site.
Schmidt said that "we are making a bold bet that innovation technology and forward-thinking urban design can make fundamental improvements in city life."

Poor Alex. The young TechFeed journalist at the heart of "South of Market: The Musical v2" wants to write serious stories that hold companies accountable for ignoring diversity and neglecting product safety hazards. But listicles like "Top 10 Colleges for Aspiring Founders to Drop Out Of" and "13 Ways Alexa Was a Basic Bitch" always get more traffic than "boring" articles on equal pay.  
"Count me out of page views," the idealistic Alex declares early in the 90-minute show. "Going rogue!" 
Parodies of the tech world aren't new, of course -- see HBO's "Silicon Valley" as the best-known example. But this one's done through song and tap dance. As the cast croons about venture capitalists and billion-dollar valuations, you half expect Erlich Bachman to pop up with jazz hands.
The show, which runs through Oct. 22 at San Francisco's Marines Memorial Theater, romps through a world of nap pods, treadmill desks, "robust self-driving data sets" and launch parties with robot strippers but no actual product to show off yet. The play follows Alex (Alex Akin stands out in the role) as she investigates hot startup ai.ai, which represents "the dawning of the great singularity, the great singularity" (sung, amusingly, to the tune of "Aquarius" from the musical "Hair"). Along the way, she may have found love, or at least a nice bearded guy to hang out with.  
James Seifert (left) and Will Letzler play ai.ai executives in "South of Market: The Musical v2."
The show is now in its second year, with all new topical material. Anyone with internet access will recognize tropes like incessant selfie-taking and hashtagging. Tech professionals will also appreciate the jargon, acronyms and send-ups of oversize Silicon Valley egos.
"Believe in yourself," the cast sings in the finale, "but not too much."  
The show does hint at weightier themes, like some companies paying lip service, but not much more, to equal pay. Then there's the song "All the Feelings," which runs through the pat Facebook reactions available in a complex world of political turmoil and natural disasters: "like, love, haha, wow, sad, angry," the chorus goes.
"Part of the premise of that song is that these six reactions … are supposed to be sufficient to interact with the news we're seeing about the world today," says Tareq Abuissa, who wrote the music and lyrics. "There's irony there that they can't actually capture what we're observing."
A number of the show's team members have backgrounds in tech or media. Samantha O'Keefe, co-producer with Pat Blute, is head of startup programs at Google Cloud, and Wall Street Journal reporter Rolfe Winkler, who covers startups, plays the clicks-obsessed millennial TechFeed editor who represents everything Alex despises. But the team also sought input beyond its ranks.   
"We went outside of our own team, running lines or scenes by individuals in the community and getting their feedback, both for their reaction and also for authenticity," O'Keefe says.
South of Market, to those who don't hang around San Francisco, refers to an area of the city known for its abundance of startups. I'm writing this from SoMA right now, though not from a sensory-deprivation-desk tank like some of those lucky TechFeed reporters have.
If you're not anywhere near SoMA and can't catch the show, the team is having it filmed and says it will be available for streaming.

Jeffrey Katzenberg believes there were two Harvey Weinsteins at work in Hollywood.
Hollywood executive Jeffrey Katzenberg was scheduled to discuss "The New New Hollywood" at the WSJD tech conference Monday evening. But under the cloud of Harvey Weinstein's sexual harassment allegations, Katzenberg ended up focusing much of his talk on a scourge that goes back to the early days of Hollywood: the casting couch.
Weinstein was fired from The Weinstein Company, the company he co-founded, just days after an Oct. 5 New York Times story first brought to light sexual harassment allegations involving dozens of women. While offering an insider's perspective of the Hollywood producer at the center of the scandal, Katzenberg noted that sexual harassment and abuse is larger than just  Hollywood, referencing recent scandals involving Fox News CEO Roger  Ailes and Fox TV personality Bill O'Reilly, Silicon Valley and even President Donald Trump.
"The casting couch has been in Hollywood from the beginning," Katzenberg said. "The complicity around the acceptance of it and silence  about it is the crime. Harvey Weinstein, make no mistake about it, he  is a monster.
"The problem is there's a pack of wolves. He's not a lone actor in this."
Katzenberg, who was chairman of Walt Disney Studios when Disney acquired Weinstein's Miramax Film in 1993, suggested during the discussion, as he did in a recent letter to Weinstein, that there were two Harveys at work in Hollywood. While being clear he wasn't defending Weinstein, Katzenberg said he never witnessed the abusive behavior that has become legend in recent days, leading him to do some "soul searching" in recent days.  
"I've had hundreds of meetings with Harvey Weinstein, and literally not a single time was Harvey abusive to someone in my presence," Katzenberg said. "Somehow this behavior was masked by him.
"The tragic part is these women masked it from us too because they were intimidated," he said.
But Katzenberg is optimistic that good things will come from this bad situation.
"The silver lining out of this is that we can't tolerate this," he said. "I think you will see in these coming weeks, real action, we can't go on this way."

Arianna Huffington discusses Softbank's investment in Uber at the WSJD tech conference in Laguna Beach, California.
SoftBank's billion-dollar investment in Uber is expected to be finalized "very likely within the next week," according to board member Arianna Huffington.
Huffington made that prediction during an onstage interview Monday at the WSJD tech conference in Laguna Beach, California. SoftBank plans to acquire a 14 percent to 20 percent stake in the world's most valuable privately-held tech startup, Huffington said Monday. The deal would include acquisition of shares through a secondary offering from existing shareholders, Huffington said.
"We are waiting at the moment on what is going to transpire with the price," Huffington said Monday. "It's all about the price."
Uber's board voted earlier this month on an overhaul of its company structure that would allow the Japanese conglomerate to make an investment in the ride-hailing startup reportedly in the $1 billion range.
Uber's board approved reforms that include eliminating its super-voting structure, in which early shareholders had 10 times the voting power, to a one vote per share model, according to a source familiar with the vote. The board also voted to expand the number of board members to 17, adding six seats to dilute recent additions made by former CEO Travis Kalanick.
The investment also comes as Uber looks to go public in the next two years.
"This is not a marriage, this is a business," Huffington said.
Uber didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

Judge issues final judgment in Apple's legal battle with patent holder VirnetX that began in 2010.
Apple's years-long legal battle with VirnetX may finally be coming to a close.
A US District Court judge in Texas has entered a final judgment in the patent case, which accused Apple of infringing patents related to its iMessage and FaceTime features. The judgment, filed on Sept. 29, means Apple is on the hook for $439.7 million in damages, patent holding and security software company VirnetX said in a statement Monday.
The damages total is nearly $140 million higher than the $302.4 million Apple was ordered to pay VirtnetX a year ago. Willful infringement added another $41 million, while attorneys' fees and other costs tacked on another $96 million, VirtnetX said.
The judgment appears to be the end of a trio of lawsuits filed since 2010 against Apple by VirnetX, a company that makes most of its money from licensing patented technology that creates virtual private networks over the internet. VirnetX alleged Apple infringed patents covering secure computer and mobile communications.
A verdict in February 2016 ordered Apple to pay VirnetX $625.6 million in damages after two lawsuits were combined. But in August, a federal judge voided the verdict, saying that combining two lawsuits into a single trial confused the jurors and was unfair to Apple. He ruled that both cases needed to be tried separately.
Apple said it plans to appeal the decision.

The Supreme Court will review the case United States v. Microsoft.
The US Supreme Court will review a high-stakes case over whether law enforcement can demand data stored overseas from a US-based email provider, according to a court order released Monday.
The case, United States v. Microsoft Corp., pits federal and state officials against tech firms, which have supported Redmond in the litigation in the name of digital privacy. It began in 2013, when a New York judge issued a search warrant seeking records and emails from a Microsoft account in a case connected with a criminal investigation. After concluding that the emails investigators sought were located on one of its servers in Ireland, Microsoft refused to hand over the information, arguing that a US judge has no authority to hand out warrants for search and seizure of property or data abroad.
The judge later rejected Microsoft's request to stop the warrant and a court ruled in 2014 that Microsoft must hand over the emails. Microsoft again refused, saying that the US doesn't have the right to access email communications from people who are not living in the country. An appeals court eventually ruled that Microsoft didn't have to supply the data to law enforcement.
The Trump administration maintains that ruling has becoming a major impediment in criminal investigations. The Justice Department said Google, Verizon and Yahoo have stopped complying with search warrants for emails and other data stored overseas. 
 "The decision is causing immediate, grave, and ongoing harm to public safety, national security, and the enforcement of our laws," Deputy Solicitor General Jeffrey Wall wrote in a June court filing (PDF). "Under this opinion, hundreds if not thousands of investigations of crimes -- ranging from terrorism, to child pornography, to fraud -- are being or will be hampered by the government's inability to obtain electronic evidence."
Microsoft has argued that Congress needs to pass legislation that would update current data laws, which were enacted more than 30 years ago. 
"The continued reliance on a law passed in 1986 will neither keep people safe nor protect people's rights," Microsoft President and Chief Legal Officer Brad Smith said in a blog post Monday. "If US law enforcement can obtain the emails of foreigners stored outside the United States, what's to stop the government of another country from getting your emails even though they are located in the United States?"
Microsoft declined to comment beyond Smith's post.
The court is expected to hear arguments early next year and rule by June.

Facebook is reportedly looking for employees who have national security clearance.
Facebook wants to hire employees who have national security clearances to help prevent foreign entities from impacting future American elections, Bloomberg reported Monday. 
The social network wants to use these people, who can access information classified by the US government, "to search more proactively for questionable social media campaigns ahead of elections," according to Bloomberg. 
Facebook officials declined to comment on the report.
Fake news disseminated online in the lead-up to Donald Trump's presidential victory last year has become a hot topic that has entangled tech giants including Facebook, Twitter and Google. Numerous reports say fake news shared on social networks helped Trump, and was connected to the Russian government.


The virtual network operator is also offering a free trial for new customers that comes with 20GB.
A plucky virtual network operator from Singapore is hoping to change things in the region.
Having successfully disrupted the local scene by offering consumers bigger data caps compared to traditional carriers, Circles.Life is hoping to shake things up in Indonesia and Hong Kong next.
Unlike traditional carriers, Circles.Life doesn't have infrastructure like cell towers. Similar to other virtual network operators in the US, such as Cricket Wireless, Circles.Life leases its network from a traditional carrier to do business.
The company said today it plans to launch in the region's biggest market of Indonesia before the end of the year. Hong Kong is also in the works, though a timeline has not yet been revealed.
The announcement comes off the launch of a new service called Circles Switch in Singapore that offers potential customers a free trial of its network. It lets users sign up for a 20GB a month plan, a move similar to Netflix's free one month trial, though Circles.Life lasts till 31 Dec 2017.
Users who subscribe to the service will automatically port their current number to the new plan after the trial ends, though they can cancel before this happens with no penalty. In Singapore, users typically sign two-year contracts when buying a new phone, such as the Samsung Galaxy Note 8 or the iPhone 8 Plus, and Circles.Life is hoping to snag new customers who are about to recontract.
Circles.Life is currently aiming for a three to five percent share of the local Singapore market, and has stated that it is ahead of schedule by two years. Competition is expected to get heated once the fourth carrier, Australian-based TPG Telecom, enters the fray in 2018.

Movies Anywhere brings together some heavy hitters to put your movies in order.
There's a new streaming movie service called Movies Anywhere, and it almost sounds too good to true. It doesn't only put most of your online movies in one place, it puts them everyplace.
Those are the basics. But let's dive into the details, including some caveats:
Now. It went live on Oct. 12.
Movies Anywhere has some major studios on board. Warner Bros., Disney, Universal, Sony and Fox are all on the service. For now, Paramount, Lionsgate and MGM/UA are the biggest holdouts -- that means no cross-platform Godfather, Indiana Jones, Katniss Everdeen or old-school James Bond, for now. You may not see some independent movies supported, either. That said, Movies Anywhere is designed as an open platform, so any studio not currently on board can theoretically join later, once licensing details are ironed out.
This is what you see when you click the "Buy" button on Movies Anywhere.
No. Movies Anywhere is essentially a front-end for your film library. If you see a film you want to purchase on the Movies Anywhere service, clicking the buy option will bring up a pop-up showing you which vendors have the video.
However, pricing information is not displayed nor does the pop-up mention if a 4K version is available at any of the services. You'll have to click through to see which is the best for you.
Yes -- once you link your Movies Anywhere account to two of the four compatible services. The free movies are: "Ghostbusters" (2016), The Lego Movies, "Jason Bourne," "Ice Age," and "Big Hero 6." You can't pick substitutes if you already own these. Full details can be found here. 
We have a quick guide to getting started on Movies Anywhere, too.
Nope, although some TV movies and miniseries like the 1990 TV version of "It" are included in Movies Anywhere.
Roku is just one of the many options for Movies Anywhere.
Movies Anywhere has apps available for iPhone ($699.00 at Apple), iPad ($299.95 at Amazon.com), Android, Apple TV ($179.00 at Apple), Roku, Amazon Fire ($54.48 at Walmart) tablets, Amazon Fire TV, Chromecast and Android TV devices. It also works on all major web browsers on Windows PCs and Macs. (See the full list of supported devices.) There are no dedicated apps for any Xbox or PlayStation consoles at the current time. But that doesn't mean the game consoles are left out in the cold -- see below.
 Basically, no. Movies Anywhere is only available to residents of the US who are 13 and older. However, once registered from a US-based IP address, users should be able to then access the features internationally.
Yes. You can download to a maximum of eight devices and a maximum of 16 devices over a rolling 12-month period.
Yes in certain circumstances: If you download a file and keep that file on a device offline for 90 days, the download will expire. Additionally, if you deregister a device, downloads will expire. If you connect that device to the internet, downloads should not expire.
Nope, you cannot watch 3D, 4K or HDR content at launch using the Movies Anywhere service. But, again, the loophole here is that many of the participating streaming services do support 4K and HDR. In its terms of service, Movies Anywhere says, "eligible UHD Digital Copy codes will flow to your connected Digital Retailers, some of which support UHD." For example, if you've connected Vudu and Google Play, a 4K film you own from Vudu could appear in your Google Play library in 4K quality or vice versa.
On Vudu's site, you'll see if a film is both Movies Anywhere and UltraViolet compatible.
It basically isn't! It's the same basic back-end technology of that service that's been around since 2014. Now, though, it's expanded to include movies from non-Disney studios.
It's similar to that multi-vendor streaming service, too, but arguably easier to use. And because Vudu was already in the UltraViolet family, any past or future disc-based movies you have with UltraViolet digital codes will be folded into Movies Anywhere (so long as it's one of the participating studios). Vudu's site will show you if a title works with Movies Anywhere and/or UltraViolet. It doesn't look like other vendors mark their movies like this. Just be sure to link your UltraViolet account with Vudu if you haven't already. 
So far, Movies Anywhere has largely been a largely smooth experience for most users on CNET's staff. That's probably a testament to the fact that the underlying infrastructure from Disney Movies Anywhere has already been tried and tested. That said, at least one person has noted two issues: Five eligible movies flowed into each supported service except Google Play, and one movie -- "Argo" -- originally purchased via Amazon hasn't propagated to the other services, even though it's a Warner movie.

Technically Incorrect offers a slightly twisted take on the tech that's taken over our lives.
OK, Google. OK. I give in.
It had been bothering me for a while, but in that way that I couldn't quite articulate.
Something simply felt not right.
I was spurred on, though, by Google's SVP of hardware Rick Osterloh.
In an interview with Recode's Kara Swisher and the Verge's Lauren Goode published on Friday, he explained that the company believes no hardware product is worth developing unless it has AI at its heart. He believes that Google is different from Apple because "we come from opposite heritages."
That's true, a grizzled mind might think. Apple was always about the human condition. Google was always about the machine condition.
Still, it's clear that Google's AI assistant is better than Apple's Siri. But there continued to be an aspect that gnawed at me like a discombobulated hungry penguin.
And then I thought back to two weeks ago.
It was during Google's event, in which it displayed its new Pixel 2 phones, its family-friendly surveillance camera and its new Home devices.
In the 37th minute, the company presented a video showing how its assistant was now very clever at understanding kids' voices.
And there it was.
A bunch of kids saying "OK Google." Over and over and over again.
I'd never stopped to think about it sufficiently. This was, indeed, the ultimate corporate chant.
You might think this merely the future. However, Apple's Siri, Microsoft's Cortana, Amazon's Alexa and even Samsung's Bixby have their own names and their own personalities.
They may or may not be so clever, but at least you feel as if you're talking to a someone.
With Google, you're talking to the Moloch. 
Kids will -- if the company has its way -- grow up to utter a company name, as if they have some sort of personal relationship with one of the biggest corporations in the world.
Please imagine how it would feel if you had grown up saying "OK, Exxon." You might just have been sent for corrective treatment.
You might insist that the word "Google" is different. After all, we talk about Googling something, as if it's the proper word for online search.
You might also point out that many little kids already believe iPad is one of their best friends. 
Yet what sort of world will it be when kids are uttering the word "Google" as much as they're uttering "Mom," "Dad," and "I want"?
It was a deliberate decision by Google not to name its assistant. The idea, as Jonathan Jarvis, a former creative director on Google's Labs team, told Business Insider last year was that Google's assistant should make you feel like Wonder Person.
"It was more like a superpower that you had and a tool that you used. If you create this personified assistant, that feels like a different relationship," he said.
Yes, it does. A human relationship. Not one in which a human is uttering a company's name to distraction.
I got a slightly different explanation from Google this weekend.
"As we've said from the start, we're calling this your Google Assistant because we fundamentally think of it as an extension and evolution of Google itself," a spokeswoman told me.
Ah, so Google the corporation really does want to be in every part of your life? It really does want kids to chant the company name all the time?
"Google has been providing assistance to users for many years across many products," the spokeswoman told me. "But thanks to the progress in natural language processing, machine learning and other core capabilities, we're at a point where we believe we can create an assistant that's helpful, smart and made just for you."
But it seems to involve you invoking the company name every minute, as if you wanted to constantly express your gratitude.
The -- intended or not -- consequence of Google's AI strategy is that humans will be uttering the word "Google" without cessation.
Do you want your kids to be Google borgs? Or will we have to send the porgs in to save them?
From gurgle, gurgle, gurgle to Google, Google, Google. That's progress.


Microsoft's new meeting spaces promote "creativity, focus and happiness."
Microsoft employees may soon be working on Word in the woods.
The company's blog on Thursday revealed three tree house meeting spaces created by builder Pete Nelson from the TV show "Treehouse Masters." 
The meeting spaces include two enclosed areas along with an elevated area named the Crow's Nest, which the company said will let employees sign onto work from the great outdoors.
Why the fuss to create these spots? According to a YouTube video showing off the workspace, it's to embrace a philosophy of nature improving "creativity, focus and happiness."
Yet the tree houses do omit AV systems and climate control -- so any PowerPoint presentations will have to stick to more traditional offices on the Redmond, Washington-based campus.
Tech companies seem to be vying with each for the wildest new office concepts for their employees, with Microsoft's tree house just the latest. Apple's "spaceship campus" opened this year; Amazon has proposed a biosphere concept for its offices; and Facebook plans to expand its existing campus in Menlo Park, California to include a "village" of 1,500 apartments.


Woz wants to train you for tech.
Steve Wozniak wants you to work in tech, and he's going to help you do it.
The Apple co-founder is launching Woz U, a digital institute aimed at helping folks not only figure out what type of tech job they might be best at, but train for it.
"People often are afraid to choose a technology-based career because they think they can't do it. I know they can, and I want to show them how," Wozniak said in a statement Friday.
Woz U starts off as online programs, but there are plans to build campuses in 30 cities around the world. Those cities will be announced within the next 60 days, Shelly Murphy, corporate relations for Woz U told CNET.
Programs offered will also range from teaching companies how to recruit, train or retrain employees to supporting school districts with science, technology, engineering, art and mathematics programs.


Uber appeal to keep its license to operate in London.
Uber today officially launched its bid to remain in London three weeks after the British capital's transport regulator refused to renew the company's license to operate citing "public safety and security implications".
The appeal, which Uber announced immediately after Transport for London made its decision on Sept. 22, allows the ride-sharing company to continue operating in the city during that process. An Uber spokeswoman said that today's filing in the Westminster Magistrates' Court is more a formal notification that the appeal is underway and that the company may never appear in court if a settlement is reached.
"While we have today filed our appeal so that Londoners can continue using our app, we hope to continue having constructive discussions with Transport for London" Uber said in a statement. "As our new CEO has said, we are determined to make things right." 
On Oct. 3, Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi visited London to meet with TfL officials after which he pledged his willingness to work with the city in a tweet. TfL also released a statement after the meeting characterizing the talks as "constructive" and said that more discussion would continue in the coming weeks. Uber has been in London since 2012.

Technically Incorrect offers a slightly twisted take on the tech that's taken over our lives.
Can you feel the inspiration?
I used to believe that Apple owned pretentiousness. 
It could describe products in ways that made you feel that its creators really believe themselves artists, rather than mundane craftspeople. Or the even lower-lifes known as nerds.
Who could ever forget Cupertino's chief design officer Jony Ive describing the iPhone 5C as "beautifully, unapologetically plastic"?
Yet here comes Microsoft with an utterly glorious collection of pretentious dialogue to describe its creation of a color called Aqua for its Surface Pro accessories.
Yes, it's exactly the sort of aquamarine-ish, turquoise-ish color you'd expect. But not as far as lead Surface designer Quan Jasinski is concerned.
As he told the Windows blog: "As designers at Microsoft, we love to use our hands and hearts when creating new products and experiences."
Now that doesn't sound like Bill Gates's Microsoft, does it? They just used their fists and their claws.
Jasinski, though, continued: "We are consistently inspired by everything around us varying from  consumer behavior, cultures merging, nature, architecture, art, science,  fashion, sports, and the list goes on."
Wait, he created the aquamarine-ish color Aqua with sports as his inspiration? No, no. It was, um, something else.
"Aqua is a soft and approachable color. When creating Aqua we drew  inspiration from our natural surroundings which helped develop its  friendly attributes," he said.
There was more.
"This color works beautifully with our materials, from the richness of  Alcantara through to the depth and sheen of anodization on our pen. It  complements the rest of the existing palette while adding a hint of  lightness," Jasinski crooned.
(Alcantara is "a unique and innovative material used in high-end luxury products, sourced only from Italy." It's the cloth-like material on the Surface keyboard.)
My eyes began to water in sheer admiration that Redmond had managed to reach these heights of depth and sheen in its word art.
Why, even in the introduction to Jasinski's words, the Windows blog offered: "Beyond new magical experiences from Windows, Office, and other app  partners that help people create in new ways with our innovative  hardware, we want to celebrate the intersection of technology and  design."
When did you ever imagine that you'd hear the word "magical" in even the same zip code as the words "Windows" and "Office"?
And wait, isn't "magical" a property of Apple? Aren't all Cupertino's products supposed to be magical and revolutionary? Apple even inserted the notion of magic into its tagline for iPhone 7: "Practically magic."
If Microsoft can create this much mind-altering gobbledegook to introduce a new color, please imagine what it might do when it creates a new computer.
"Even something as minor as taking a different road to work can change the way you view the world," Jasinski told the Windows blog.
I think quite a few people in Redmond have been taking a different road to work lately.

Amazon Studios chief Roy Price, seen with Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos (left) at Amazon's Emmy Celebration in 2016, has been suspended amid a sexual harassment allegation.
 Amazon has suspended Roy Price, the head of its movie and TV show division, amid allegations he made unwanted sexual advances toward a female producer.
Price, the head of Amazon Studios, was accused of lewdly propositioning Isa Dick Hackett, a producer on "The Man in the High Castle," according to an interview published Thursday by The Hollywood Reporter. Hackett, daughter of the late science fiction writer and "High Castle" author Philip K. Dick, said in the interview that Price repeatedly made unwanted sexual advances toward her after a dinner two years ago during Comic-Con in San Diego. Price declined The Hollywood Reporter's request for comment.
"Roy Price is on a leave of absence effective immediately," an Amazon spokesman said in a statement after the interview's publication, adding that "we are reviewing our options for the projects we have with The Weinstein Co."
The suspension came a week after an Oct. 5 New York Times story first brought to light sexual harassment allegations against Hollywood movie producer Harvey Weinstein. Weinstein denies all allegations of nonconsensual sex but has said he's getting counseling.
Earlier Thursday, actress Rose McGowan reported that her Twitter account had been suspended after she spent a few days tweeting about the allegations against Weinstein, whom she has accused of raping her. After her account came back online Thursday, she sent five tweets directed at Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, including one in which she said she'd told the "head of your studio" about the incident.
"@jeffbezos I told the head of your studio that HW raped me. Over & over I said it. He said it hadn't been proven. I said I was the proof," McGowan wrote in a tweet.
1) @jeffbezos I told the head of your studio that HW raped me. Over & over I said it. He said it hadn’t been proven. I said I was the proof.
Twitter tweeted about the suspension, explaining that McGowan's account had been temporarily locked because one of her tweets included a private phone number, which violated the company's terms of service.

Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg met with the Congressional Black Caucus on Thursday. 
Facebook has been criticized for the lack of diversity on its board. Now, the social network says it's going to do something about it.
Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook's high-profile COO, told members of the Congressional Black Caucus Thursday that the company plans to add an African-American director to its board.
Facebook didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. A spokesman for Rep. Robin Kelly, a Democrat from Illinois and a member of the CBC, confirmed the remarks by Sandberg, but declined to provide further comment. 
Sandberg reportedly told the lawmakers the company is in talks with a candidate, but declined to disclose a name or timeline for the appointment, according to a report from USA Today.
Right now, none of Facebook's eight board members are people of color.
Sandberg is in Washington, D.C., trying to contain the fallout from Facebook's ad controversy, in which Russian agents bought more than $100,000 ads in an attempt to interfere with the 2016 US election.
The trip comes as Facebook prepares to testify on Nov. 1 at Congressional hearings about foreign actors using social media to try to meddle with the election. Twitter and Google are also expected to testify. Silicon Valley companies have been in damage-control mode in response to the ad controversy, trying to fend off the looming threat of regulation from Washington, D.C.
Aside from discussions about Facebook's board, the CBC also talked to Sandberg about more transparency around its ads.
"I think today's meeting was productive and sets us on a path to get more answers and eventually, change. Facebook and other digital companies cannot become a Trojan Horse for foreign efforts to influence our democratic elections," Rep. Kelly said in a statement. "All companies – whether it's a tech giant or mom-and-pop shop – need to follow the law, protect customer data and not be complicit in foreign threats to our security."

Google CEO Sundar Pichai announced the new Grow with Google program.
Google says it doesn't want to leave anyone behind as technology changes the way people live and work. 
The search giant on Thursday introduced $1 billion in new initiatives aimed at training and educating workers to help them find jobs and grow their businesses. Google will spend the money over the next five years to fund grants to nonprofits globally as part of efforts to prepare people for the "changing nature of work."
CEO Sundar Pichai unveiled the programs during an event in Pittsburgh, joined by  Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf and Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto.
"We're always asking how we can make sure the opportunities created by new technology are available for everyone, in any city, in any state," Pichai said. "In asking that, we recognize that there are large gaps in opportunity across the U.S. These are tough gaps."
The initiative comes as tech giants in Silicon Valley face growing scrutiny over the implications of technology and automation on jobs and the workforce.
One of the initiatives, called Grow with Google, aims specifically to help US workers by giving them access to Google products and in-person training sessions. The company will host a tour of sessions, kicking off in Indianapolis, Indiana, on Nov 10 and 11.
Google also announced a partnership with Goodwill, including a $10 million grant. The partnership will have 1,000 Google workers train 1.2 million people in digital skills over the next three years. The company also said its employees will volunteer 1 million hours to organizations helping to train and educate people for work.

Rose McGowan is at least temporarily off Twitter.  
Twitter on Thursday gave actress Rose McGowan a timeout amid an uproar over alleged sexual harassment and assault in Hollywood.
In an Instagram post early in the day, McGowan said, "Twitter has suspended me. There are powerful forces at work."
The actress, best known for her role on the supernatural drama series "Charmed," had spent the last few days tweeting about allegations against Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein. She also   posted a screenshot of a message from Twitter stating that her account would have some of its features limited for violating Twitter's rules. 
But a person familiar with the matter told CNET early Thursday that McGowan's Twitter account was "temporarily locked," not suspended.
Later on Thursday, Twitter tweeted about the matter,   explaining that McGowan's account had been locked because one  of  her tweets included a private phone number, which violated the   company's terms of service.
The tweet has been removed and   McGowan's account was unlocked. Twitter stated it would be clearer   about its policies in the future. A representative for McGowan said the actress was not available for comment.
McGowan is one of a number of actresses who went public in an Oct. 5 New York Times story that first brought to light sexual harassment allegations against Weinstein. A New Yorker story this week has also alleged sexual assault. Weinstein denies all allegations of nonconsensual sex but has said he's getting counseling. 
Twitter has frequently come under fire for not effectively dealing with harassment on its social network. The company says it holds all individuals to the same rules, but some Twitter users have voiced concerns that US President Donald Trump gets a free pass. Twitter said in July that it has clamped down on 10 times as many abusive tweeters as it had a year earlier, but Thursday's incident suggested that the company's approach may not be clear to everyone.
The locking of McGowan's account came soon after the actress tweeted foul language to actor Ben Affleck and accused him of lying about his knowledge of Weinstein's sexual misconduct.
Account locking, or limiting, is a feature that's part of Twitter's efforts to reduce abusive behavior on the social media platform. The company outlined its account-limiting process in a blog post in March, which described a "pattern of abusive behavior" as a violation of its rules.
While locked accounts are still accessible to other users, suspended accounts are typically not, even though they still exist on Twitter servers. If you try to view a suspended profile, you'll see a notice explaining that the account has been suspended.
On Thursday afternoon, McGowan sent five tweets directed at Amazon CEO and founder Jeff Bezos, including one is which she said she'd told the "head of your studio" that Weinstein had sexually assaulted her. She also called on Bezos "to stop funding rapists, alleged pedos and sexual harassers," adding that "I love @amazon but there is rot in Hollywood." McGowan did not name the studio head, but Roy Price was the chief of Amazon Studios until Thursday.
"Roy Price is on leave of absence effective immediately," an Amazon spokesperson said. "We are reviewing our options for the projects we have with The Weinstein Co."

Sheryl Sandberg says Facebook will do more to prevent election interference.
Facebook has been asked a lot of questions about its role in hosting Russian-backed ads during the 2016 US presidential election.
On Thursday, Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg took a crack at answering some of them during a public interview with news site Axios.
"Things happened on our platform in this election that should not have happened," she said. "We know we have a responsibility to do anything we can to prevent that."
That means fully cooperating with Congress and supporting the eventual release of the ads, as well as information on how they were targeted to specific audiences on Facebook.
This is the first public interview for Sandberg, or any senior Facebook executive, since the controversy over Russian ads reached a fever pitch last month. In September, CEO Mark Zuckerberg acknowledged that more than $100,000 worth of ads were bought by what now appear to be Russian agents who were attempting to interfere in the 2016 US election. Earlier this month, the social network handed over 3,000 such ads to Congress.
When Zuckerberg made that announcement, he also vowed Facebook would commit itself to protecting "election integrity." He promised more transparency around political ads and said Facebook would add 250 people across all its teams working on safety and security.
During Sandberg's interview with Axios, she reiterated steps Facebook is taking to minimize the chance that this sort of interference will happen again, including heavily investing in machine learning, hiring more staff to increase oversight related to advertising, and increasing transparency, as well as working with third party fact-checkers and offering people warnings when they're about to share an article that's been flagged as having false information.
"There have always been bad actors out there trying to undermine our values," she said. "We can make it a lot harder for people to harm us."
Sandberg's Axios interview is part of her trip to Washington, DC, this week to meet with members of Congress as Facebook deals with the ad controversy. Sandberg's trip comes as Facebook prepares to testify at congressional hearings on Nov. 1 on the use of social media by foreigners to interfere with the election. Both Twitter and Google are also expected to testify.
Silicon Valley companies have been trying to do damage control in response to the controversy, in hopes of heading off stricter regulations from Washington. When asked if Facebook was a media company and should be regulated as such, Sandberg said Facebook is a tech company at heart, but does bear some responsibility for what happens in the platform.
She also said efforts among other platforms need to be coordinated, noting that Facebook isn't the only site where these types of problems popped up.
Last month, Twitter said it discovered 201 accounts that may be tied to the same Russian accounts that purchased the Facebook ads. Google, too, is in the midst of an internal investigation and reportedly found that Russians paid for tens of thousands of dollars on ads on YouTube, Gmail and Google search.
Sandberg also showed how maintaining free expression on the platform can be tricky. Targeting ads toward specific audiences, for example, can be helpful for businesses with very specific products but goes awry when used for discriminatory purposes. Sandberg noted that Facebook would not have taken down US Rep. Marsha Blackburn's ad mentioning "baby body parts" in reference to abortion, as Twitter initially did this week. Blackburn is a Republican from Tennessee. 
"When you cut off speech for one person, you cut off speech for everyone," Sandberg said.

Airbnb partners with major landlord to allow for short-term rentals in its buildings.
Most landlords don't allow tenants to sublet their apartments on Airbnb. That's because it typically comes with increased risk and no profit for them. But a major landlord in Florida is trying something new: working with Airbnb.
Airbnb said Thursday that it's partnering with Newgard Development Group to allow for short-term rentals in a 324-unit building in Kissimmee, Florida. Tenants who live in this building can freely put their apartments on Airbnb for up to 180 days per year. The catch is that they have to share the income with Newgard.
This partnership "eliminates barriers by encouraging home sharing and creating solutions that work for everyone," Newgard CEO Harvey Hernandez said in a statement.  
In just under a decade, Airbnb has gone from a website for couch surfers to having a massive online presence. It lists millions of homes for rent in almost every country on earth. That growth, however, has come with challenges.
The company has waged extended battles with landlords, regulators and housing advocates in major cities around the world, including San Francisco, New York, Paris, Berlin and Barcelona. So, over the past year, the company has been working to make nice with lawmakers while also shift its business model.
Airbnb has gone from being solely a home-rental service to a semi-travel agency, in which travelers can book excursions and make restaurant reservations through its site. It's also acquired smaller companies like the high-end vacation rental service Luxury Retreats. The new partnership with Newgard appears to be yet another way Airbnb can broaden its focus.
"This partnership shows how landlords, developers and Airbnb can work together to create value for everyone and better serve tenants," Jaja Jackson, Airbnb's director of global multifamily housing partnerships, said in a statement.  "Together, we're making it easier for more hosts to share their space."
Airbnb and Newgard are branding their partnership as "Niido." Under this approach, they will give Newgard residents tools for renting out their apartments on Airbnb, such as a "Niido" app that helps with guest check-in, cleaning and linen service.
The companies said this is just the beginning. They plan to continue working together to design new "Niido" apartments and buildings built specifically for subletting to short-term renters and tourists. The designs will have features like keyless entry and shared common spaces.
"As the cost of living increases, apartment renters are under intense financial pressure," Hernandez said. "Niido's unique multifamily home-sharing model provides a powerful solution to this ongoing problem by delivering extra income for tenants while creating enhanced experiences for their guests."

Watch out, Netflix and Hulu: There's a new streaming service in town. And it could have everything movie and TV fans want.
Launching Thursday, Movies Anywhere is a new all-in-one service that will bring some of the world's biggest movie studios and digital streaming platforms together into the one platform, meaning US viewers can watch content bought from multiple services through the one app.
The app will work on iOS and Android devices, Amazon Fire devices, Apple TV, Android TV, Chromecast and Roku devices, as well as in browsers. Movies Anywhere said more platforms and retailers are still to come.
We're yet to go hands-on with Movies Anywhere -- stay tuned to CNET to get our first impressions Thursday -- but already there's an impressive list of Hollywood studios on board with the new service. 
That means Movies Anywhere will have films from Sony Pictures Entertainment, The Walt Disney Studios (including titles from Disney, Pixar, Marvel Studios and Lucasfilm), Twentieth Century Fox Film, Universal Pictures and Warner Bros. Entertainment.
But you're out of luck if you want to watch "House of Cards" or "The Handmaid's Tale" from launch. Netflix and Hulu are the most notable names left off the list of digital services compatible with Movies Anywhere.  
Consider the battle lines drawn.
The major Hollywood powerhouses have come out to support the new service, but there's one company at the front of the pack.
Former Walt Disney Studios senior vice president, Karin Gilford, has been charged with leading the project as Movies Anywhere's general manager. According to a statement, Gilford will lead an independent "cross-functional team of product, technology, marketing and other professionals" as part of the project.
Gilford described Movies Anywhere as "a virtual one-stop movie-watching shop" and a massive step forward for consumers wanting to access digital movies and TV.
"Consumers never have to remember where they purchased a film or which device they can watch it on, because all of their eligible movies will be centralized within their Movies Anywhere library and available across platforms through the Movies Anywhere app and website and also available at their connected digital retailers."
The likes of Netflix and Hulu have long held pride of place in the digital media landscape, but there are signs that the world order is changing. In August, the Walt Disney Company announced it would be pulling its titles from Netflix by 2018 (including flagship Marvel and Star Wars titles) to start its own streaming service the following year.
And there's the rub. While Netflix and Hulu have reduced their reliance on outside studios by creating their own Originals in-house -- like "Stranger Things" or "The Handmaid's Tale" -- there's no doubt big names like Disney, Sony and Universal still produce a great deal of the titles viewers want to watch.
That's where services like Movies Anywhere could rise to the top. Your average movie buff doesn't want to know about the machinations of studios and streaming services -- they just want the latest blockbusters in one place. By securing the buy-in of major studios as well as digital retailers, Movies Anywhere could soon be the one-stop-shop for viewers, giving them what they want, where and when they want it.

Pinterest helped unwittingly share political posts from Russian operatives, the company acknowledges.
Pinterest, the social media site popular for sharing recipes, photos of clothes and inspirational quotes, also helped share Russia-linked political posts during the 2016 campaign.
The visual bookmarking site became a repository for political posts created by Russians operatives seeking to influence public opinion and promote divisiveness in the US, the company acknowledged Wednesday. The Russian operatives didn't post directly to Pinterest, but their messages found their way to the site after Pinterest users saved messages on Facebook and Twitter to their boards.
"We believe the fake Facebook content was so sophisticated that it tricked real Americans into saving it to Pinterest," a Pinterest spokesperson said in a statement. "We've removed the content brought to our attention and continue to investigate."  
Pinterest joins a growing list of Silicon Valley companies that were unwittingly tapped to assist in Moscow's disinformation campaign, including Facebook, Google and Twitter. The abundance of fake news on the internet in the lead-up to President Donald Trump's victory last year has become a hot-button issue, with many suggesting fake news shared on the social networks helped Trump win.
Facebook said last month that it identified about 500 "inauthentic accounts" that bought $100,000 worth of ads that targeted highly politicized social issues such as immigration, guns, and LGBT rights. Facebook has sent records of the ads to government investigators looking into Russia's alleged meddling in last year's presidential election.
Facebook isn't alone. Twitter told congressional investigators last month that it had discovered 201 accounts that appear to be tied to the same Russian accounts that purchased ads on Facebook. Russian operatives also spent tens of thousands of dollars on ads on YouTube, Gmail and Google search, Google revealed earlier this month.

The Justice Department has some questions about Uber's business practices.
Uber is learning that chickens come home to roost.
The ride-hailing company is now facing five Justice Department inquiries, according to Bloomberg. Three were identified over the last few months, but two were just revealed on Wednesday.
One of the new investigations is looking into whether Uber violated price-transparency laws after using a tool that charges passengers different prices for the same ride, Bloomberg said. The other is examining the company's role in allegedly using stolen self-driving car technology from Waymo (the autonomous car unit of Google's parent company Alphabet).
This means Uber's new CEO Dara Khosrowshahi has his work cut out for him. He was hired in August after a litany of scandals forced company co-founder and former CEO Travis Kalanick to resign in June.
Uber -- with its prior no-apologies attitude and notoriously aggressive former CEO -- upended the taxi industry and became one of the biggest ride-hailing services on the planet, since its founding in 2009. Although this approach helped the company grow, it also courted controversy and lawsuits.
Uber has been sued by everyone from its drivers to passengers to employees to high-level investors over the past couple of years. That's not to mention the massive lawsuit brought by Waymo over allegedly stolen self-driving car technology -- the same issue the Justice Department is now looking into.
Other Justice Department investigations include two separate probes into software Uber developed. One is looking at Uber's "Greyball" tool, which the company used to evade police in cities where the service wasn't yet legal. The other is examining software called "Hell" that Uber used to thwart its competitor Lyft.
The Justice Department also reportedly opened a criminal bribery probe into whether an Uber executive in Asia illegally obtained a copy of a rape victim's medical report, according to Bloomberg. The victim was raped by an Uber driver in India in 2014.
Both Uber and the Justice Department declined to comment.

More trouble for Qualcomm, this time in Taiwan.
Taiwan is the latest country to slap an antitrust fine on Qualcomm, the world's largest provider of chips for phones and other mobile devices.
The island nation's Fair Trade Commission said Wednesday that it had fined the US-based company $773 million, Bloomberg reported.
Qualcomm has a monopoly on patents for certain crucial mobile phone technologies, and it violated local laws by refusing to license that tech to companies that wouldn't play by its pricing rules, Taiwan's FTC said, according to Bloomberg.
Qualcomm said it disagrees with the decision and plans to file an appeal.
The Taiwanese move is the latest in a string of actions worldwide against Qualcomm. Last month, the chipmaker filed a second appeal in South Korea over an order from that country's FTC that resulted in an $850 million fine. In Europe, Qualcomm faces the specter of a $669,000-a-day penalty after losing a July appeal. And in the US, the company failed in its June bid to have a federal judge toss out an FTC antitrust lawsuit against it. The company also suffered a nearly $1 billion antitrust fine in China, back in 2015.
First published Oct. 11, 11:46 a.m. PT.Update, 2:05 p.m.: Adds that Qualcomm plans to appeal.


Technically Incorrect offers a slightly twisted take on the tech that's taken over our lives.
As the launch of iPhone X gets closer, it's fair to ask: "Is anyone really excited?"
At the time of its unveiling, I talked to real people who mostly felt very meh about Apple's so-called "smartphone of the future."
Yet along comes investment bank Piper Jaffray's latest "Taking Stock with Teens" survey and insists that US teens are more excited about iPhone than ever.
Piper Jaffray surveyed 6,100 US teens across 44 states.
In this twice-a-year survey of teens' mercurial minds, 78 percent said they owned an iPhone. And 82 percent declared that their next phone will be an iPhone. This is the highest iPhone-loving number the survey has ever seen.
Which might make some wonder: "What on earth are the competitors doing?" Or, perhaps: "Are there that many hand-me-down iPhones floating about the world?"
Still, these are the fall results gleaned from talking to 6,100 teens, with an average age of 16, from various income groups across 44 states.
It's tempting to imagine that teens have turned conservative, as the winds of crazy currently buffering the world make them hunker down with a few trusted choices.
Yet the survey points to very famous brands that have fallen out of favor. Facebook, for example, saw a significant decline, especially among younger teens. Nike suffered too. Facebook, however, might be cheered that Instagram enjoyed a lift.
And here's another expression of teen tech-centric love. 49 percent of all teens said their favorite retail website was Amazon. Are we all desperate to pay less for more -- well, more convenience, at least?
Also, 17 percent of these teens said they planned to buy an Apple Watch in the next months. That's up from 13 percent in the spring survey. 
Where do they get the money from? Please don't tell me it's their ever-indulgent parents.

Mark Zuckerberg, at Facebook's F8 developer conference earlier this year.
"At every step along the way, the future is built by people who believe it can be better."
That's the message that Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's CEO, brought to the company's fourth annual Oculus Connect virtual reality developer conference Wednesday. As in previous years, Zuckerberg took the stage to discuss the promise of what virtual reality can be and to show off some goodies.
The company has tallied 100 million downloads of apps that work with Oculus, and it continues to work on a less-bulky version of its headsets, he said.
Zuckerberg also set a goal: Get 1 billion people into VR. 
He didn't say by when, but showed off a new lower-cost device, called Oculus Go, to help make it happen. 
Unlike the flagship Oculus Rift device, the Oculus Go doesn't need to be tethered to a bulky PC or have a phone snapped into it. Instead, it's self-contained, and will cost $199 (less than half the $499 price tag of the Rift) and be available by "early next year," Zuckerberg said.
Hugo Barra, Facebook's head of Oculus, said he believes more people will use VR when they have a standalone device like Oculus Go. It was designed to be more comfortable, with stretchy straps to hold the device on your head and with a more breathable fabric. It also has speakers built in, so you don't have to wear headphones.
"We believe Oculus Go will be the most accessible VR experience," Barra said.
The company also said it's working on a new version of its Rift headset. A prototype first shown last year, called "Santa Cruz," will be made available to developers next year, Barra said. In the meantime, Oculus said it'll cut the Rift's price to $399, marking a third price cut in the year and a half since the device launched.
While these new features and products are key to Facebook's efforts, Zuckerberg also delved into the promise of what virtual reality can do. Most people won't have a chance to go into space, he said, but they can in VR. He also talked about doctors using VR ahead of heart surgery and teams holding meetings in virtual rooms. 
"We're legitimately excited about the future and we're committed to making it a reality," he said.

Katniss Everdeen, the heroine of "The Hunger Games," isn't the only woman willing to make a sacrifice.  
Forget men being from Mars and women from Venus. When it comes to diversity in the workplace, men and women may not even be in the same universe.
That's one way to read a joint study out this week from LeanIn.org, the organization founded by Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg, and McKinsey & Co. In what may be the largest study of its kind, the "Women in the Workplace 2017" report concludes that some well-worn assumptions are stunningly wrong. Thought women don't have the guts to ask for raises and promotions? Wrong. Believe women are more likely to be promoted over men by "social justice" fanatics? Wrong again. Assume the US workplace is a meritocracy? Let's not even dignify that one.
In fact, after talking to 70,000 workers at 222 companies that employ more than 12 million people, the landmark study found that women are "underrepresented at every level in corporate America, despite earning more college degrees than men for 30 years."
Let's allow a few of the findings to speak for themselves:
• About 37 percent of women believe their gender played a role in missing out on a raise, a promotion or a chance to get ahead, compared with 8 percent of men.  
"The gap begins with entry-level jobs and widens the higher you climb," Sandberg wrote Tuesday in an op-ed piece summarizing the report for The Wall Street Journal. "This isn't because of attrition; women and men stay with their companies at roughly the same rate."
• Women ask for promotions at the same rate as men but are promoted less often. The study found that "at the first critical step up to manager, women are 18 percent less likely to be promoted than their male peers." Looked at another way: If women were promoted at the same rate as their male colleagues, then the number of women in SVP and C-suite jobs "would more than double."
That's sobering.
• More men than women think their company is doing "what it takes to improve gender diversity."
• Nearly 50 percent of men think women are "well represented in leadership," even at companies where only one in 10 senior leaders is a woman. Sandberg calls it a sign that "we're too comfortable with the status quo."
The report has lots of numbers highlighting the very real differences in how men and women view their treatment in the workplace. (Note: The numbers are even worse when it comes to racial equality.) Yes, companies should strive for fairness and equality in the workplace. But the norm is also bad for business: The numbers prove that companies with more-diverse workforces and more-diverse boards are more productive and deliver higher profit than their rivals. 
That's from a McKinsey study of 366 companies from 2015, by the way.
The male-dominated tech industry knows it must do better -- and not just in workplace equality. Over the past several months, tech executives and venture capitalists have witnessed a wave of sexual harassment scandals, starting with Uber. According to The New York Times, this has led to "unintended consequences" that may set women back even more: Some VCs are avoiding solo meetings with women entrepreneurs and job candidates, even to the point of shunning critical networking meetings.
"A big chill came across Silicon Valley in the wake of all these stories, and people are hyper-aware and scared of behaving wrongly," one VC who asked to remain anonymous told the newspaper. "They're drawing all kinds of parameters."
What a mess. And it comes down to the fact that the leaders at many of these companies -- who say they're focused on addressing the #womenintech problem -- simply can't see what they can't see.
What do you do when that happens? You bring in people who can see it for you.  
And so, in the immortal words of Katniss Everdeen, "I volunteer as tribute."  
I'm willing to give up my long-time career as a tech and business journalist to serve on the boards of a few tech companies that are flummoxed by the lack of progress in their equality efforts.
After more than two decades covering Silicon Valley and the tech industry for MacWeek, Wired, Upside, Bloomberg, Forbes and now CNET, I know a few things about how the industry operates, even though I, like many board members at tech companies and some VCs, don't have a STEM degree.  
And while I may not have "binders full of women," I do know many talented, ambitious, smart women whom I can recommend for leadership jobs across a variety of tech companies, from service providers to product makers to social network builders. Oh, and let's not forget, I bring perspective that should prove valuable to companies where qualified women are just too hard to find. 
Yes, leaving journalism would be a sacrifice, given that serving as a director for tech companies no doubt requires very long hours for dismal pay. I think I can manage. And I'm certainly willing to step up for my fellow #womenintech and help those brave, forward-thinking companies that truly want to solve this diversity problem, if only to stop having to read reports about how dismal the situation is.
Let the revolution begin.

Sheryl Sandberg's LeanIn.org and McKinsey & Co. conducted a massive study of women in the workplace. 
A lot of men out there just don't get it.
That's one of the big takeaways from the "Women in the Workplace 2017" report out Tuesday from management-consulting firm McKinsey & Co.  The report was conducted in partnership with LeanIn.org, a nonprofit founded by Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg that focuses on women's empowerment.
The report surveyed more than 70,000 employees from 222 companies and found that many men feel pretty good about how diversity efforts are going at their companies.
In fact, 50 percent of men surveyed think that if women make up 10 percent of their company's senior leadership, that's good enough. Fifty-five percent of men think that disrespectful behavior toward women is often or always addressed quickly, compared with 34 percent of women.
Meanwhile, the numbers of women further up the corporate ladder continued to thin out -- women make up about 18 percent of C-Suite roles and women of color only 3 percent.
"These gender gaps persist even though companies' commitment to gender diversity is at an all-time high. What's going wrong?" Sandberg wrote in a Wall Street Journal op-ed Tuesday discussing the report.
For tech in particular, the push to diversify has never been harder. Companies like Facebook, Google, Apple and others have unveiled plans to attract more women and minorities to their ranks through everything from outreach programs and partnerships to re-evaluations of hiring practices and pay scales. In 2015, Intel pledged $300 million toward diversity efforts.
And yet, year after year, percentages of women and minorities in tech workforces increase only slightly, progress that former US CTO Megan Smith called "abysmal" at last week's Grace Hopper Celebration, a conference dedicated to the advancement of women in computing.
Sandberg said the effort seems to have stalled out because of what she called blind spots.
"It's hard to solve a problem we don't fully see or understand -- and when it comes to gender in the workplace, too often we miss the scope and scale of the issue," she said.
LeanIn.org did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The report touches on other ways being a woman in the workplace can be fraught. Many women do ask for promotions, for example, but there's a catch. Compared with men who negotiate and women who don't, women trying for a raise are more likely to be labeled bossy, intimidating and aggressive.
LeanIn.org is combating this stigma with Ban Bossy, a campaign that criticizes the use of the word "bossy" to describe assertive women and girls.   A video for the campaign, which includes big names such as entertainers Beyoncé and Jennifer Garner and former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice highlights how ambition in women and girls is often cast as something negative. After all, being called bossy isn't a compliment.
And if you're a woman of color, the challenges are compounded. Women of color are more underrepresented, get promoted at a slower rate and get less support from managers. Black women in particular are the least likely to have contact with anyone on a senior level.
But most of all, the report showed a disconnect between how companies and employees view diversity efforts. Ninety percent of companies say they prioritize gender diversity, while only 42 percent of employees think that's the case.
"We won't unlock the full potential of the workplace until we see how far from equality we really are," Sandberg said.

Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg is headed to Washington, DC, this week.
Facebook is bringing out some of its VIPs to deal with intense scrutiny in Washington, DC.
The social network is sending Sheryl Sandberg, its high-profile chief operating officer, to the nation's capital this week as the company deals with the controversy over ads bought by Russian agents meant to spread misinformation during the 2016 US election.
Sandberg's trip comes as Facebook prepares to testify on Nov. 1 at congressional hearings about foreign actors using social media to try to interfere with the election. Twitter and Google are also expected to testify.
One of Sandberg's stops will be a meeting with the Congressional Black Caucus. The group last week sent a letter to Facebook and Twitter asking for more transparency around foreign threats and false news. "Members of Color, in particular, are additionally impacted by this issue, as the communities we represent are disproportionately strong consumers of social media, and additionally vulnerable to these attacks and misinformation," members of the CBC wrote.
Recode earlier Tuesday reported the news. CNET independently confirmed the meeting. Facebook didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.
Another of Sandberg's stops will be a public interview with Mike Allen, executive editor of the website Axios.
The move comes as Silicon Valley giants try to fend off the looming threat of regulation from lawmakers. Along with Facebook, both Twitter and Google have investigated potential Russian meddling on their platforms.
Facebook earlier this month handed over 3,000 ads from Russian-linked accounts to Congress. Twitter said last month it discovered 201 accounts that appear to be tied to the same Russian accounts that purchased ads on Facebook. Google is conducting its own internal investigation and reportedly found that Russians spent tens of thousands of dollars on ads on YouTube, Gmail and Google search.

Are you going to buy a virtual reality headset?
Seriously. Are you?
I'm not the only one who wants to know. The VR industry is having an awkward moment. Though headset makers have spent years and billions of dollars promising world-changing technology, relatively few of us have actually lined up to buy them.
That sales problem is likely to be among the things discussed at the fourth annual conference for one of the darlings of VR, Oculus, which Facebook bought three years ago for as much as $3 billion. More than 2,500 app and game makers are expected to attend its annual developers conference, called Oculus Connect, starting Wednesday in San Jose, California.
Facebook's Oculus VR division promises discussions on how health care, movies and video games are adapting to this still nascent technology. One panel will explore how the disability community can benefit from VR gear and presentations.
The talk underscores the potential of VR. Yes, the high-end headsets are bulky and need special setup and long thick cables tethered to big PCs. They're expensive too, with Oculus' Rift costing $499 and requiring a $500 PC before you can get set up. But after you put on those VR goggles -- basically strapping a screen inches from your eyes -- your brain can be tricked into believing you've been transported to whatever computer-generated world you want.
You could be in the middle of a massive space battle or dive to the bottom of a shipwreck and come face to face with a blue whale. Or you could watch cartoon bunnies hack your brain. Maybe you want to meet people from around the world and chat while hanging out on a idyllic beach.
For some people, VR is more than that. Rae O'Neil, a 34-year-old IT worker from Nova Scotia, had always been fascinated with VR. But it was her grandfather's reaction to the Rift that made its promise clear.
In his 80s and disabled after losing a leg a few years prior, he put on the headset and began using an app called Blue Marble, which lets you float in space, looking at planets while music plays in the background. 
"He felt like he was actually in space," she recalled. It brought a tear to her grandfather's eye.
Those kind of otherworldly experiences helped convince Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to buy Oculus after trying a prototype of the headset back in 2014.
"Virtual reality was once the dream of science fiction," Zuckerberg wrote on his social network after buying the startup. Back then, he said, VR had the potential to remake everything from education to medicine to communications, just like the phone and computer had done in their day. "The future is coming."
It still is.
President Barack Obama, in 2016, watches a VR film captured during his trip to Yosemite National Park.
Oculus' flagship Rift headset hit store shelves in March 2016, with so much hype leading up to the launch that even then-President Barack Obama gave it a whirl as part of a virtual tour of the White House.
But a lot of people still haven't bought in.
Facebook's been tight-lipped about shipments, but several people familiar with Oculus said that fewer than a quarter million Rift headsets were sold during their first year on the market. Facebook declined to comment on Rift sales.
But the company signaled its frustration with the anemic interest when it pulled Rift demo stations from hundreds of Best Buy stores around the country in February.
The PlayStation VR is backed by one of the biggest game companies in the world.
Then, the social media giant cut the headset's price. Twice. It was being sold for $400, a third less than its original price, for six weeks over the summer before jumping back up to $499.
The company's chief competitors, Sony and HTC, followed suit. The PlayStation VR dropped to $400 from $500, and the Vive dropped to $599 from $799 all in the past three months.
The price cuts were enough to juice demand for Oculus, two people familiar with the company said. Though current total tallies couldn't be learned, at least a million units are estimated to have been sold.
Sony, by comparison, says it sold more than a million units of the PlayStation VR as of June, just eight months after going on sale. HTC didn't respond to a request for sales data.
The question of demand is causing some VR game and app developers to worry about their future.
"It's not happy sunshine and rainbows," said James Iliff, co-founder and creative chief at VR game maker Survios, which made early hit shooters Zombies on the Holodeck and Raw Data, one of the first VR games to rack up $1 million in sales. "We are very much in a trough of disillusionment."
That "trough of disillusionment" comes from the "Hype Cycle," a theory popularized by research firm Gartner and whose stages have become mantra in Silicon Valley. The goal of the Hype Cycle is to chart the expectations and emotions around products as they're introduced, innovated upon and eventually adopted -- or not.
In the beginning, there's the "Innovation Trigger," when new tech is introduced. Then hype and excitement begin to build until the new thing eventually hits the "Peak of Inflated Expectations." That's followed by the crash into the "Trough of Disillusionment." (Gartner says VR is nearly out of that stage and headed into the "Slope of Enlightenment," just before mass adoption.)
Iliff and his co-founders worked on early VR research before Oculus was founded. He felt expectations were getting too high, particularly in the media, and expected a backlash of sorts. So, he's prepared.
This month, for example, Survios made Raw Data more widely available for Oculus, Vive and PlayStation VR. Survios is also looking beyond VR for customers, redesigning Raw Data to work in arcades as well.
"The game industry is hard, it is a tough industry, and that is not going away," he said. "That's the same for VR."
Paul Bettner, CEO of Playful, says his latest Lucky's Tale game is designed to be "VR friendly," but he's not wedded to the tech.
On a Friday in September, Paul Bettner was giving a speech in San Francisco at VRDC, another VR developer conference. The title of his talk was "How to Be a Successful VR Game Studio."
As CEO of Playful, one of the first high-profile VR game makers and co-founder of the company behind the hit social game Words With Friends, Bettner wanted to share his perspective.
One of the most important slides in his presentation: "Don't be a VR game studio."
"The point I was trying to make in that talk was to pursue a high-level vision," Bettner said. While VR is a medium to make great games, companies shouldn't be focused just on making great games for VR. "It's a means to an end, not the end," he said.
He's taken his own advice. When the Rift went on sale last year, it included Playful's Super Mario 64-like adventure game,  Lucky's Tale, bundled for free. This year, he's partnered with Microsoft to publish the sequel, Super Lucky's Tale, to work with the company's Xbox video game console when it's released in November.
Bettner said he hasn't given up on VR. He's just not wedded to it.
"It's intoxicatingly amazing how magical the technology is, but we can't fall in love with that," he said. "We have to fall in love with our mission to bring the experience to our players."
Augmented reality tech, that blends computer images and the real world, has many developers excited.
The most exciting changes in the VR industry in the past year haven't come from the game industry but from phone makers.
Over the summer, Apple and Google announced new technologies called ARKit and ARCore, respectively, that are designed to help iPhones and iPads or any device powered by Google's Android software marry computer-generated images with the real world.
A $2.99 app, Star Guide AR, highlights stars and constellations in the sky once you point your phone at them. Another, Ikea Place, previews furniture in your home with a tap. Walk around your living room and you can see the furniture you placed while looking through the screen on your phone. So far, both are available only for the iPhone.
"The excitement is catching, and one could easily imagine 'There's an AR app for that' could become a common phrase," wrote CNET's Sean Hollister and Scott Stein back in August.
App developers I spoke with say they're excited by augmented reality and believe it may help spur people to eventually buy VR systems as well. That's because AR, which was used so effectively in last year's Pokemon Go craze, may get people comfortable with more immersive apps, which is part of the essence of VR.
"We're finally at the point where I think the technology has caught up to make good user experiences," said Scott Montgomerie, head of Scope AR, which makes training simulators. For businesses, overlaying information on the real world can help train employees on multimillion-dollar equipment like oil rigs and rock drills.
That's part of why Microsoft's focusing on both AR and VR. In an October update to its Windows 10 software for PCs, the company is partnering with device makers like Lenovo, Dell, HP, Acer and Samsung to create headsets based on its designs. They'll sell for as little as $300 each when they begin hitting store shelves Oct. 17.
"There's a bit of a waiting game," said Brian Blau, an analyst at Gartner who once worked for a VR company. "Without a vibrant running ecosystem, it's hard for parts of it to do their best."
That's also why developers will trek to Oculus Connect this week, hoping whatever Facebook shows off will spark excitement.
That new stuff, though, will need to clear a pretty high bar to persuade people like Sam Le to buy one. The 31-year-old wedding photographer from Austin, Texas, is a hardcore gamer. He's bought each video game console at launch, be it an Xbox, PlayStation or Nintendo device, and he owns a powerful PC to run his favorite games. He spends hours a each day playing alone and with friends.
After trying HTC's headset last year at the SXSW music and entertainment festival, Le decided to take the plunge and buy a PlayStation VR. He returned it a month later and ate the $80 he spent on the games.
The experiences were exciting but not enough to justify the price. "It's a question of which is worthy of my investment?" he said. None of his gaming friends has bought a VR system either.
Le said he's willing to buy the headsets at some point, but they need to be worth it. "I've waited this long," he said. "I can wait another year."
That's not the answer Oculus and its developers want to hear.

Teams looking to streamline how they communicate should consider the Echo Show.
This Amazon device, which is basically an Echo speaker with a built-in Fire tablet, offers both video calling and voice calling, as well as access to Alexa and Alexa skills, all of which you can use to communicate with members of your team -- whether you want to check in with them or hold a conference call. It also works with the Alexa app, so even if you're away from your desk, you can accept a call from your boss or co-workers and essentially stay connected.
Sure, there are several enterprise-level chat apps available that also provide video calling for teams, but Amazon delivers some advantages, thanks to its AI assistant Alexa, with its growing library of skills. 
Here's how you can draw on the power of Amazon's latest Alexa device to transform your office.

Imagine if everyone in your team had an Echo Show sitting on his or her work desk. They'd all be able to keep in touch, even if they walked away from their desks for a minute. You see, the Echo Show supports Alexa-to-Alexa calling and messaging in the US. It's a free feature that provides calling and messaging between supported Echo devices and the Alexa app on compatible iOS (9.0 or higher) and Android (5.0 or higher) phones. And it doesn't use mobile plan minutes.
Once your team members have set up their Echo Show devices, ask them to share their contact information with each other and to download the Amazon Alexa app from the Apple App Store or Google Play Store. From there, in the Alexa app, they'll need to select the Conversations icon from the navigation bar at the bottom of the app and follow the onscreen prompts. They must confirm their names, enable access to their contact lists and verify their phone numbers through SMS. Amazon will use their address books to find people they know who use the Alexa app or supported Echo devices, so it should, at this point, find every person in your work team.

To place a call via your Echo Show, all you have to do is say, "Alexa, call [name of contact]." The contact will need to be listed under the Contact screen of the Alexa app, and you have to say the name exactly the way it appears in the app so that Alexa can understand your request. When you call a team member, it will ring through to his or her Alexa app and Echo Show device at the same time -- and your contact can answer on either. 
To toggle the video aspect after the call has started, say, "Video [off / on]", or you can touch the on/off video button on your Echo Show's screen. So, with this setup, you can quickly place a video or voice call to a team member to, for instance, talk about an ongoing work project, rather than having to stop what you're doing and walk across the entire length of the office.
When you receive a call from a team member, your Echo Show will sound a soft alarm and glow green. You can answer or ignore any call from your Echo Show by saying, "Answer" or, "Ignore." Alternatively, you can tap the answer or ignore button from the Alexa app on your smartphone. To end your call, say, "Hang up" or you can select the end button from the Alexa app. 
The beauty of this feature is that you can have one-to-one video or voice calls with any team member from your desk, and it won't take up any workspace on your laptop. You can continue doing what you're doing, and the Echo Show sitting next to you will handle all your calls. Also, if you should leave your desk at any moment, your calls will automatically be routed through to your smartphone, allowing you to stay remotely connected.
Sending a message is a lot easier than having a full-on phone call with a team member. Better yet, sending a voice message is quicker than typing one out. Amazon's system allows team members to fire off voice messages, eliminating the need to manually type out a complex thought or place a call to explain something. 
To send a voice message via an Echo Show, simply say, "Alexa, send [name of contact] a message," and then say your message. Team members can access their voice messages by saying to their Echo Show, "Alexa, play my messages." They can also send voice messages and play them back from the Conversations screen of the Alexa app (just tap the blue microphone button in a contact's conversation thread to send a new voice message). When you receive a voice message, you get a notification from the Alexa app on your phone and the lights on your Echo Show will glow green.
Team supervisors will love the Echo Show's Drop In feature, but team members might come to hate it.
You can also send a text message to a team member in your contact list -- but you have to use the Alexa app. Under the Conversations screen, tap the New Conversations icon, then pick a contact from your address book and select the text field to open your keyboard. From there, type your message and tap the Send button. Team members will get a notification and can read your message as well as respond with a text themselves via the Alexa app.
Team supervisors will love the Echo Show's Drop In feature, but team members might come to hate it. Drop In lets Echo Show users instantly connect -- hands-free. You can enable Drop In via the Alexa app and grant permission to team members from your address book. Then, to Drop In on a team member, just say, "Drop In on [contact name]" via your Echo Show. Alternatively, from the Conversation screen in Alexa app, select the Drop In bar and choose the contact you want to Drop In on. Although you can use the Alexa app to Drop In on other devices, other devices can't drop in on the Alexa app.
When you Drop In on a team member, the light bar on that person's Echo Show will pulse green, and you will automatically connect and can hear anything within range of that device. Your team member should see a frosted glass video that transitions to clear video shortly after connecting, which gives him or her time to prepare for the video call. But anyone can turn off the video at any point during the Drop In simply by saying, "Video off" or by selecting the Video Off button on the screen. In other words, with this feature, your boss can virtually pop into your office to say "Hi" -- wonderful, right? (Sarcasm.)
Amazon offers a Do Not Disturb feature so that you can block Alexa from alerting you about incoming calls and messages. Obviously, this is handy if you're swamped with work and cannot be bothered by Joe in the next cubicle who wants to tell you about his fishing trip over the weekend. To turn on Do Not Disturb, say, "Alexa, don't disturb me." To turn off the feature, say, "Turn off Do Not Disturb," or you can tap the Do Not Disturb button on your Echo Show's screen. To schedule Do Not Disturb for a specific time via the Alexa app, select Settings from the Menu, then choose your device, and tap Scheduled under Do Not Disturb. Then use the slider to toggle Do Not Disturb on or off, and select Edit to change the time you want Do Not Disturb to start or end.  
Amazon has indicated it will update the Echo Show with more calling features in the future. Already, it has announced plans to introduce call waiting, as well as the ability to transfer calls between devices, place calls on hold, leave voicemails and place a three-way call. We suspect it will one day add the ability to do SMS texting and group video calls, making the Echo Show even more useful for team communications. Most recently, it launched multiroom music. However, as of September, the feature only supports tunes from certain streaming services. That means you can't use it to have a multiroom audio call (aka intercom) with several Echo devices in your office -- though, again, that feature could always be enabled down the road with an over-the-air update.

Over time, more Echo Show-specific productivity skills will become available.
Alexa skills expand what you can do with the Echo Show in the workplace. Currently, there are only a few skills that take advantage of the device's screen, but, over time, you can bet more Echo Show-specific skills will be available to use. After all, the Echo platform is only a few years old, and as of January 2017, it had over 15,000 skills. Developers clearly see the potential and are actively creating new ways to make use of the platform.
Here are a few skills worth checking out now to see if they fit your team and its needs (you can enable any of them just by asking Alexa):
Conference Manager by Vonage is a conference skill that interfaces with your Google calendar to identify your next conference call and save you the hassle of dialing in. Just say, "Alexa, start my call" and it will look at your calendar, then extract the conference information and dial the bridge number, meeting number and participant code. It will then call you, so all you have to do is pick up the phone. It currently supports WebEx, Goto Meeting, BlueJeans and Vonage Business conferencing. Check out the skill from here.
AT&T's Send Message skill lets AT&T customers send SMS text messages through their Amazon Echo devices. Once enabled, just say, "Alexa, ask AT&T to text David," followed by your message, such as "I am running late, but will be there in 30 minutes." Check out the skill from here. There's also a new Mastermind skill by Convessa that's in a closed beta. Although we have yet to test it out due to the waitlist, it promises to let Alexa users send and receive SMS text messages, make phone calls, get Caller ID, cast to a Chromecast TV, launch mobile apps, read and manage app notifications and more. Check out that skill from here.
For some people, Twitter is a distraction at work, but for other people, it's a necessary tool for real-time news updates and communication. If your team relies on Twitter for staying in the loop, consider trying the Twitter Reader skill. It's made by Twitter itself. When enabled and linked to your account, it can read your timeline, mentions, retweets and likes. It also lets you search tweets. To get started, say, "Alexa, ask Twitter what is happening." Unfortunately, it doesn't yet let you post tweets. Check out the skill from here.
If your team uses Slack to communicate, then consider Chat Bot for Slack. It isn't an official Slack skill, but after you link your Slack account, it will let you post to Slack -- hands-free -- using your Echo Show. All you have to do is say the Slack channel name and the message you want to post. We can see this skill coming in handy if you're doing something near your desk and can't easily get to your laptop to respond to team members. Check out the skill from here.

You can set reminders and named timers via Alexa, which is useful if you have trouble staying on task and need a nudge every now and then. Just say, for instance, "Alexa, remind me to call David at 4 p.m.," and it will notify you at the proper time. Reminders are tied to the device you set them on, so don't expect to set a reminder in your office and hear it on the Echo Show in your living room later. 
Alexa also now supports named timers, as well. You can check how much time is left on a certain timer by asking, "Alexa, how much time is left on my lunch break timer?" and it will let you know. Alternatively, you can use a third-party skill for your reminders and timers. The Cubic Reminder lets you set up reminders triggered by time, weather conditions and TV schedules, of all things. So, you can say, "Alexa, tell Cubic to notify me when next episode of 'Silicon Valley' starts." Check out the skill from here. We're not sure why you'd watch TV while at work, but these features are certainly helpful when it comes to trying to complete tasks on time.
Does your office use Nest's indoor security camera? If so, you can enable the Nest Camera skill to start streaming live video to your Echo Show. Just say, "Alexa, show the lobby camera" or, "Alexa, show feed from the lunch room." Check out the skill from here. Be sure to browse Amazon's skill library for other useful camera skills, such as the Ring video doorbell skill.
For more interesting Alexa productivity skills, see ZDNet's roundup here.
Amazon is actively expanding the ways we can use its Echo devices, including the new Echo Show, either by rolling out updates itself or by allowing developers to create new skills.  For instance, Microsoft and Amazon recently partnered to enable their respective personal digital assistants to work together. That means you will soon be able to say to your Echo Show, "Alexa, open Cortana." Or, if you use a Windows 10 device, you will be able to say, "Cortana, open Alexa." Already, the Echo Show is a useful device for one-to-one video and voice calls, voice and text messaging and conferencing with team members.
It's only a matter of time before Amazon adds even more features, making the Echo Show a go-to communications hub for businesses of all sizes. For now, however, we think it's ideal for small teams looking for interesting ways to spruce up how they keep in touch and stay productive.

The state of California has enlisted one of the most powerful firefighting tools on the planet: a modified Boeing 747 aircraft that can drop 19,200 gallons of fire retardant.  
The aircraft flew six flights over devastating fires across Napa and Sonoma counties in Northern California yesterday from its base near Sacramento. San Francisco CBS affiliate KPIX recorded the aircraft with air-to-air video as it dumped red fire retardant over a burning hillside.
Global Supertanker, the aircraft's owner, says the 747 Supertanker can refill with gel, foam or water in just 30 minutes and can fly at 600 miles per. Now called The Spirit of John Muir, its the largest firefighting airplane in the world by far.
The flightpath from the Supertanker's last path over the fires yesterday shows a series of loops. 
Built in 1991, the 747-400 first flew for Japan Airlines before being converted to a tanker aircraft in 2012 by its previous owner Evergreen International Airlines. Though the aircraft has been under contract by the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection since last month, previous missions have taken it to Chile Israel, Mexico and Spain. 
Since they started burning last weekend, 11 fires in California's Wine Country have killed at least 11 people, injured at least 100 and burned at least 1,500 homes and businesses. In Santa Rosa, California, entire neighborhoods were destroyed.



Tuesday would've been the 156th birthday of the man who invented the Nansen Passport, a document that allowed refugees to find new homes during World War I. Google is marking the day with a Doodle for Fridtjof Nansen.
Born in Norway in 1861, Nansen's early life was dedicated to exploration. He led an expedition across Greenland on cross-country skis and tried to reach the North Pole on another trip. He fell short on the latter, but traveled farther north than anyone had at the time.
He turned his attention to humanitarian work after the onset of World War I. He won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1922 for his efforts to help prisoners of war and refugees.


EasyJet, an airline best known for flying Brits across Europe to sunny locales, wants you to know it cares about the planet. Two weeks ago, it held an Innovation Day at London's Gatwick Airport to show it's using technology to take better care of its aircraft and lessen their impact on the environment.
The star of the show was one of EasyJet's new A320neo airliners. Outfitted with new engines (neo is an acronym for New Engine Option), these newest A320s cut emissions by 15 percent and reduce noise by 50 percent. EasyJet didn't take us for a flight, but we boarded the aircraft for a taxi across Gatwick from the North Terminal to the airline's maintenance hangar. 
Inside the hangar the airline showed a number of demonstrations, from how it's using drones to inspect its aircraft from damage after lightning strikes to how it's slowly adopting electric tugs to push aircraft back from the gate. But the most astounding announcement is EasyJet's plan to introduce an electric aircraft to fly passengers by 2027.

Major Twitter investor and ex-Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer said social networks aren't currently able to prevent fake news. 
But he does think they can help curb it. 
With companies like Facebook, Twitter and Google facing heavy scrutiny from Congress over Russian operatives potentially meddling in the 2016 presidential election, Ballmer told Bloomberg TV on Monday that he'd like those companies to adopt a system that lets users know whether they're getting news from a trusted source.
Twitter investor Steve Ballmer said the major social platforms must adopt strategies to fight fake news. 
He compared his plan to Twitter's blue-checkmark "verified" badge. Last week, Facebook introduced a feature offering context on articles posted on users' newsfeed. This includes a button that launches a pop-up window providing details about the article and its publisher.
Ballmer's comments come as Facebook disclosed last week that Russian-linked buyers had placed ads on the social network that were seen by 10 million people. Two weeks ago, Twitter said it had found more than 200 accounts on its platform connected to the buyers of the Facebook ads. And according to reports on Monday, a Google investigation found that Russian agents bought tens of thousands of dollars in advertising on YouTube, Gmail and Google search.
Twitter, Facebook and Google officials are expected to testify before Congress about Russian influence on their platforms on Nov. 1.
When asked about Twitter's ongoing harassment problems, Ballmer said while he believes in free speech, all social networks need to take action to remove "wholly inappropriate" content.
"There is a line once crossed, you need to make sure you are moving that stuff out of the public sphere," he said.  
Regarding President Donald Trump's at-times controversial tweets, Ballmer said Trump has a right to be heard. Ballmer's comments echo a similar sentiment by Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey as the company has no plans to kick Trump off anytime soon. 
"It's what he's thinking," Ballmer said about Trump. "And every voter probably benefits from the ability to hear it directly."

Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg takes a 360-degree video tour of the hurricane devastation in Puerto Rico.
Mark Zuckerberg took to virtual reality on Monday for a new partnership with the Red Cross to assist relief efforts in hurricane-whipped Puerto Rico.
The Facebook CEO -- represented by his Oculus avatar -- took Facebook users on a 360-degree video tour of the devastation left on the island by Hurricane Maria. During the presentation, which was hosted from Facebook's headquarters in Silicon Valley, Zuckerberg detailed how the company is using artificial intelligence and satellite imagery to identify areas of need on the island.
"We use artificial intelligence to build what we call 'population maps' so you can look at satellite imagery of an area and get a sense of where it is that people actually live and the density of different places and where there's infrastructure going to in those places," Zuckerberg said. "That's going to help the Red Cross figure out where people are who need help."
Zuckerberg's use of his cartoonish avatar comes as Facebook prepares to host Oculus Connect, its annual Oculus developer conference. Zuckerberg, who spent as much as $3 billion to buy industry leader Oculus VR back in 2014, has championed VR as a way to remake the way we learn, go to the doctor and be entertained.
He also discussed the company's efforts to restore connectivity on the island, much of which was left without power after the category 3 storm lashed the island last month with 125 miles per hour winds. The storm claimed 34 lives on the island.
Zuckerberg said his company had already sent several employees to the island to help ensure networks were operating properly.
"When you are in the middle of a disaster like this, it's really important that people have access to the internet," he said, noting it's useful in communicating with loved ones. "But it's also important so that when relief workers go down there, they can coordinate with each other and know where people need help."
Zuckerberg also noted that Facebook had already donated more than $1 million to relief efforts.

People don't think about us so much since we stopped featuring sexy women eating our big, fat burgers sexily.
I know. But what are you going to do? Everything's so PC these days.
How about we give up?
We're marketing people. We never give up. 
No, give up the company and make money. How about we beg Amazon to buy us? I mean, we're almost as healthy as Whole Foods.
And that is how I imagine that Carl's Jr.'s more fertile minds came up with the marketing ideas that, on Monday, coursed all over Twitter like burger fat rolling into a teenage boy's ear.
It began at 3 a.m. Eastern on Monday, as the burger chain's Twitter account was adorned with, for example, this: "HEY @Amazon BUY US. Srsly. For real. Let's do this. Let's change the future of eating!!"
HEY @Amazon BUY US. Srsly. For real. Let’s do this. Let’s change the future of eating!! #AmazonBuyUs
Srsly.
And then there was this: "OBVI our $5 All Star Meal Boxes & @Amazon boxes belong together. At midnight we'll prove it to you!"
OBVI our $5 All Star Meal Boxes & @Amazon boxes belong together. At midnight we'll prove it to you! #AmazonBuyUs pic.twitter.com/XaEOkvag0t
OBVI.
If only it had stopped with one or two tweets. One might have put it down to good cheer. Or too much lemonade. 
But no. The whole of Columbus Day was filled with Carl's Jr. offering its ideas for a seamless partnership between itself and Amazon. 
BIG IDEA 2/24: “Tender Button” Push a button, get a tender! Delivery time may vary. @Amazon #AmazonBuyUs pic.twitter.com/VlAHyORsqz
Yes, there was more. A lot more:
BIG IDEA 6/24: “Cloud-Based Restaurant” A first in food. How’s it work? Thats where you come in @Amazon #AmazonBuyUs pic.twitter.com/Y1IkHUbaA5
A Carl's Jr. spokeswoman emailed me before I'd even woken up to tell me that the company was "serving Amazon a delicious offer they would be crazy to refuse."
Crazy.
Jeff Jenkins, Carl's Jr.'s chief marketing officer, was excitedly telling USA Today: "This is about generating a conversation around a partnership. The tweets are obviously a start to  try and see where the dialogue goes … have a lot of fun with it, and see  if they find the spirit of it as fun as we do."
Obvi.
Equally obvi, some might feel, Amazon didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Srsly.
By later in the day, it seemed that Carl's Jr. was beginning to see that its tease was that of a wooer with a hairless chin.
"Our  goal has always been to put a smile on our customers' faces, and we  hope that's what we've done by celebrating the absurdity of our billion-dollar ideas that we had a ton of fun coming up with," Jenkins told me.
I'm always glad when people have fun, especially a ton of it. I fear, though, that too many of Carl's Jr.'s tweets weren't enjoyed by a ton of people.
Most enjoyed a number of retweets and likes so paltry that, if President Donald Trump had received so few, he would have blamed Twitter censorship. In a tweetstorm, of course.
Carl's Jr.'s Twitter account has known this pain before.
Last month, it tried to mock rival Wendy's. Here's what it replied to a customer who asked how Wendy's compared with Carl's Jr.
LOL they don't
And here's what Wendy's legendarily sharp Twitter account offered in return.
Yeah, for one, if we were going to diss another restaurant we'd have more than zero likes and RTs after 13 hours. https://t.co/VUDXEHKqEB

Apple CEO Tim Cook met Monday with French President Emmanuel Macron.
Apple CEO Tim Cook met with Emmanuel Macron on Monday in Paris but reportedly didn't quarrel with the French president over a proposal in Europe to extract more taxes from tech giants.
Macron is spearheading a group of European nations in an effort to change laws that allow companies to minimize their tax burden by funneling revenue through countries such as Ireland and the Netherlands. The two didn't discuss past disputes, but Cook accepted that laws are changing to hold companies accountable for taxes where profits are actually earned, Macron's office told Bloomberg.
Tax deals in Europe have come under scrutiny by the EU over the past couple of years. The EU believes Ireland hasn't been collecting enough taxes and instead has been giving companies like Apple too big of a break on Ireland's already low 12.5 percent tax rate.
Last year, the EU ordered Apple to pay a whopping 13 billion euros ($14.5 billion) in back taxes. Apple has contended that the commission is trying to change the rules after the fact.
The meeting comes less than a week after European regulators slapped Amazon with a bill for 250 million euros (about $294 million) in unpaid taxes. The European Commission determined that Amazon had had an illegal deal with Luxembourg since 2003 that allowed the company to move money between its subsidiaries so profits were taxed there instead of a country with a higher corporate rate. 
The meeting, held at the French presidential palace at Cook's request, also focused on climate change, education and French economic reforms, Bloomberg reported. 
Apple didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

Google is the world's largest online advertisement platform.
Russian operatives spent tens of thousands of dollars on ads on YouTube, Gmail and Google search, an internal Google investigation has uncovered.
The ads are the first evidence Google has found that show Russia was trying to use the company's advertising platform to influence the 2016 US presidential election, according to a Washington Post report on Monday.
At the same time, those ads do not appear to have originated from the same Kremlin-backed source that bought ads across Facebook, said sources familiar with the investigation, suggesting that a number of entities could share responsibility in the Russian effort to spread disinformation.
"We have a set of strict ads policies including limits on political ad targeting and prohibitions on targeting based on race and religion," a Google spokesperson said Monday. "We are taking a deeper look to investigate attempts to abuse our systems, working with researchers and other companies, and will provide assistance to ongoing inquiries."
The presence of fake news stories on social media, and charges of Russian meddling, cast a shadow over the 2016 presidential election in the US. A year later, tech companies and government officials are still trying to figure out the full extent of the issues.
Google has for the most part avoided the level of scrutiny aimed at fellow Silicon Valley stalwart Facebook, which handed over 3,000 Russia-backed ads to Congress earlier this month. But Google's own investigation got its spark from pressure by  Congress to determine the extent to which Russian operatives used social media and bought ads across internet platforms.
Facebook's role extends beyond ads to the sorts of hoax stories that showed up in people's news feeds. Over the weekend, the its security chief defended the social media giant's use of algorithms, describing the problem of fake news as larger and more complicated than many realize.
"I am seeing a ton of coverage of our recent issues driven by  stereotypes of our employees and attacks against fantasy, strawman tech  [companies]," Facebook's Alex Stamos said in a Twitter thread. "Nobody of substance at the big companies thinks of algorithms as neutral."
On Nov. 1, Google officials are expected to testify in front of Congress on the issue, along with representatives from Facebook and Twitter.

Uber is playing by the rules.
Ride-hailing giant Uber is suspending its unlicensed service UberPOP in Oslo until Norway introduces new rules.
UberPOP allows unlicensed drivers to provide lifts to Uber users, differing from Uber X, which uses licensed drivers. It has already been suspended in cities across Europe, including Paris and Brussels, for contravening local rules.
Other Uber services, Uber Black and Uber XXL will continue to operate in the Norwegian capital.
It marks the beginning of a new, more humble chapter for Uber, following the announcement last month that the company's license will not be renewed in London.
"We've learned the hard way that we must change as a company in order to serve the millions of riders and drivers who rely on us. With our new CEO Dara Khosrowshahi onboard, it's a new era for Uber," said Uber in a statement to Reuters. "That's why it's now time to pause UberPOP in Norway, in order to relaunch under new regulations."
Uber is taking a similar path in Finland, which is currently in the midst of introducing new taxi laws, due to come into effect next summer.


Microsoft's Lumia 550 was one of the first phones equipped with Windows 10 Mobile. But now, the OS is on the way out. 
Bill Gates has given up his Windows phone. HP is pulling production of its flagship Windows handset. Now Microsoft has finally seen the writing on the wall -- there aren't enough people using Windows 10 Mobile or enough apps to make it viable.
Corporate vice president of Windows 10 and head of Microsoft's "PC-Tablet-Phone" division, Joe Belfiore, said on Twitter Sunday that Microsoft will continue to support Windows 10 Mobile with bug fixes and security updates, but new features and hardware are no longer front and centre.
Of course we'll continue to support the platform.. bug fixes, security updates, etc. But building new features/hw aren't the focus. 😟 https://t.co/0CH9TZdIFu
Microsoft is no upstart in the mobile space. It produced versions of its software for mobile devices for more than 20 years -- starting with Windows CE for personal digital assistants in 1996, and later with Windows Mobile in 2000.
But the ecosystem has struggled since the launch of Apple's iOS in 2007 and Google's Android operating system in 2008. According to the most recent sales figures from Kantar Worldpanel, Windows phones account for just 1.3 percent of the market in the US, bested only by BlackBerry at 0.3 percent. Compare that with Android's 64 percent share of new phone sales and 34 percent for iOS (figures that are closely matched in the UK and Australia).
Microsoft has attempted to leverage its legacy in the PC space to push further into mobile -- Windows 10 Mobile was billed as the "everywhere OS" that would let users shift seamlessly between desktop, tablet and mobile. 
But users have long complained the lack of apps on Windows Mobile devices is a deal breaker.
While Belfiore said Microsoft has tried "very hard" to provide incentives for app developers to get apps onto Windows Mobile, the "volume of users is too low for most companies to invest" in the ecosystem.
We have tried VERY HARD to incent app devs. Paid money.. wrote apps 4 them.. but volume of users is too low for most companies to invest. ☹️ https://t.co/ePsySxR3LB
But don't discount a comeback. On the same day Belfiore poured 140 characters out for Windows Mobile, BlackBerry -- the company with less than 1 percent market share in the US -- unveiled a brand new all-touch smartphone, the BlackBerry Motion.
In the world of mobile phones, it seems big brands are never truly gone for long. And if nothing else, we'll always have SwiftKey.

Technically Incorrect offers a slightly twisted take on the tech that's taken over our lives.
Elon Musk thinks Clips is blatantly intrusive.
Elon Musk isn't sure about artificial intelligence.
He worries it could start World War III. He thinks it's a far greater threat than North Korea. He wants it regulated immediately.
So when Google presented its new AI-based camera Google Clips last week, you might imagine that Musk wouldn't be overly excited.
On Saturday, however, he seemed to accuse Google of a blatant disregard for privacy. 
Musk took to Twitter and referenced a video of Clips posted by the Verge. "This doesn't even *seem* innocent," he tweeted. 
This doesn't even *seem* innocent
Clips, you see, works by using AI to instantly recognize faces of special interest to its owner and, when it spots those faces, takes candid pictures of them. 
Without the face-owners necessarily knowing. 
An LED light does flash to say the camera is on. There are, however, lots of those around the house that we happily ignore.
Google declined to comment specifically on Musk's tweet.
A company spokeswoman did tell me, however, that Clips is "a camera and made to be used intentionally to capture more moments -- 7-second clips -- of the people that are important to you."
She added: "All  of the machine learning happens on the camera and Clips does not  connect to the internet to transfer content. And, just like any  point-and-shoot, nothing leaves the camera until you decide to save it and share it."
The company is marketing it toward families. 
Some might say, though, that it suffers from the same photographing-people-when-they-don't-know-you're-doing-it thing that made Google Glass such an anti-social tool.
Perhaps it's the vivid memory of Glassholes that encourages the company to discourage anyone from clipping it to themselves. Google claims that the camera has to be stationary to achieve its best effects.
Musk's overt criticism is unlikely to amuse Google. He has a dedicated following. 
Some might say, though, that the problem with Clips is a problem with much of technological progress.
Why, during Hurricane Irma, Tesla remotely boosted the battery life of some cars at their owners' request.
If it can do that, couldn't it stop cars remotely too? 
At heart, you either trust the company you're dealing with or you don't. And Silicon Valley companies aren't currently doing too much to make themselves trustworthy at all.


Facebook Security Chief Alex Stamos defends the use of machine learning in combating the fake-news problem.
Facebook's security chief is warning critics that the fake news problem is more complicated than many are aware.
Alex Stamos, who's spearheading the company's probe into Russian-linked ads placed on its service during the 2016 election campaign, on Saturday defended the company's use of algorithms, which determine what users see in their news feeds, parsing out hate speech and threats of violence.
"I am seeing a ton of coverage of our recent issues driven by stereotypes of our employees and attacks against fantasy, strawman tech [companies]," he said in a Twitter thread. "Nobody of substance at the big companies thinks of algorithms as neutral.
"Nobody is not aware of the risks," he wrote. 
A lot of people aren't thinking hard about the world they are asking SV to build. When the gods wish to punish us they answer our prayers.
Facebook has drawn flak for its role in perpetuating hoaxes and its influence on the presidential election, and has in recent months worked to combat the rise of fake news. In response, the company said in August it would expand a program to offer related articles on a trending topic that offer fact-check articles and other perspectives.
The company also said it would use "updated machine learning" to detect more potential hoaxes and send them to third-party fact checkers. 
The abundance of fake news on the internet in the lead-up to President Donald Trump's election victory last year has become a hot-button issue, entangling tech giants like Facebook and Google. Numerous allegations say the fake news shared on the social networks helped Trump win.
Stamos' team said in August it had identified about 500 "inauthentic accounts" that bought $100,000 worth of ads that targeted highly politicized social issues such as immigration, guns and LGBT rights. Facebook has sent records of the ads to government investigators looking into Russia's alleged meddling in the 2016 US presidential election.
Facebook didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

It's Complicated: This is dating in the age of apps. Having fun yet? These stories get to the heart of the matter.


Technically Incorrect offers a slightly twisted take on the tech that's taken over our lives.
Once upon a time, there was a world beyond the screen ...
Taking responsibility for what you've gone and done is hard.
Especially when you're in the tech industry and insist you're making the world a better place.
Yet some, at least, are reaching an age far enough beyond puberty to stop and wonder about the meaning of "better."
Take Jonathan Rosenstein. 
The Guardian reported Friday that the former Facebook engineer, who created the "like" button (and helped create Gchat at Google), has set up parental controls on his iPhone. 
Well, he got his assistant to do it for him.
The purpose, it seems, is to prevent him from downloading any time-sucking, mind-numbing apps. 
"It is very common for humans to develop things with  the best of intentions and for them to have unintended, negative  consequences," he told The Guardian.
It's not so common for humans to admit this.
"One reason I think it is particularly important for us to talk about this now is that we may be the last generation that can remember life before," Rosenstein said. (At 34, he's getting on in tech years.)
I'm just about old enough to remember life before. Before, it felt like I had more free time. Now it is, indeed, a constant battle with oneself to avoid looking at one's phone because something "important" might have appeared there. 
Like an Instagram "like."
Constant use of your iPhone has become "normal."
It gave me pause, then, when Rosenstein's admission was published on the same day that Apple's chief design officer, Jony Ive, insisted that constant iPhone use represents misuse.
In an interview at The New Yorker's TechFest, Ive talked about the "authentic pursuit of excellence" and happiness.
"If I get to sit down for two hours with one of the world's best silicon chip designers, I could not be happier," Ive said.
You see, designers aren't like you and me. They have a chip in their hearts, not on their shoulders.
But he insisted that the definition of iPhone misuse is "constant use." 
This may be a noble thing to say. However, designers of both hardware and (especially) software deliberately create products that encourage you to use them constantly.
Many tech companies exist to follow you around, so that they can use your data to make money. 
And now that artificial intelligence has come along, that ability to follow you around -- and prompt you to do everything through your gadgets -- has grown. After all, your Siri and Google assistant are designed specifically to get to know you like the back of an algorithm, and to do that they need all the information they can get.
When an iPhone is beautiful, allows you to communicate, gives you information and answers, and even offers you Instagram likes, you're surely likely to use it all the more, not less.
Neither Apple nor Facebook responded to a request for comment.
It's surely the case that many tech companies -- Facebook and Apple included -- have contributed to our almost primal need to stare into our phones. Even when we cross the street.
Apple is clearly not oblivious to this. Its iOS 11 is already nagging me to download a feature that will stop me using my phone in the car. 
That, though, is a safety issue. 
When technology has moved fast, broken our former way of life and insisted that all things must be digital, it's getting harder and harder for humans to resist.
Rosenstein and Ive have clearly considered some of the negative consequences of their creations.
Ive has always been characterized by his decency. It's entirely authentic that he should be aware of iPhone overuse. 
But, really, what can we do about it? Someone needs to find a way to get us to think different.
Or is it already too late?

Attendees gather for keynote sessions. 
Why is this still happening?
That was the subject of a rant delivered by Hasini Sundaresan, a junior computer science major at the University of Texas, Dallas.
Sundaresan spent the summer interning at Juniper Networks in Sunnyvale, California. The day news broke that a Google employee had written a 10-page document trashing diversity efforts and suggesting women are biologically unsuited to work in the industry, she was at Juniper, virtually across the street from Google's Sunnyvale campus, trying to make sense of it all.
The summer had been great so far. She described Juniper as being "full-on for diversity."
And yet, in a metaphorical sense, she couldn't help thinking about how someone across the street thought she didn't belong in computer science.
"It was hard to see that so close to where I was," she said. "In a place where everything is so futuristic, there's still this backward mentality."
Sundaresan wasn't alone in wrestling with this issue. She was one of the 18,000 attendees at this year's Grace Hopper Celebration. It's an annual conference put on by AnitaB.org, an organization aimed at the advancement of women in computing. 
You can imagine that the Google employee's document was a popular topic of conversation. There were more than a few subtle and not so subtle references to it in various keynote presentations, and it underpins why so many women flock to this conference every year, boosting attendance records higher and higher. Prejudice is, in fact, still happening.
Over three days at the Orange County Convention Center in Orlando, Florida, women at all career stages gather to listen to speakers, attend sessions, network, look for jobs, or just be reminded that even if they're the only woman on their team at work, they're definitely not the only woman in the industry.
"I've seen [students] being spooked by the challenges ahead," said Brenda Darden Wilkerson, who just this October took the reins as president and CEO of AnitaB.org. She wants to make it known: "We understand what you're experiencing, and you're not alone."
For students, this is a particularly important message. Back in the 1980s, women accounted for about 37 percent of graduating computer science majors. For myriad reasons, including the marketing of early personal computers to boys and the rise of the typically male, supergenius geek in popular culture, that percentage has fallen to around 18 percent.
That's troubling for a variety of reasons, including the fact that tech positions are among the country's highest paying jobs. A 2016 report from IT consulting firm Accenture found that by missing out on tech gigs, women could be missing out on nearly $299 billion in economic opportunity by 2025. Accenture also projected that women's share of tech jobs will only shrink.
This year I spent a good chunk of my time at Grace Hopper, held Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, walking around the career fair, a sprawling event dotted with corporate whimsy. Companies handed out swag and set up igloos, tiki huts and brightly colored signs to draw job seekers toward recruiters. I talked with students about what it's like to be studying to enter the tech field.
They know the deal. They've read the articles. They know they could end up sitting near the writer of the next anti-diversity document. They also know that letting it get them down isn't going to help them succeed. Many are finding the support they need at their schools. Others, not so much. And some are already thinking about how they can help the women who will enter the field after them.
Allison Mutka grew up hearing about computer science. Both her parents are in the industry. She also heard from her mother, though, that women have been underrepresented in the field for a long time.
"She would always tell me that when she was going through school, she was one of the only females," the Michigan State University sophomore said, standing near the career fair entrance. "She'd get put down."
Though Mutka discovered she genuinely liked computer science, she was also motivated to get into the field by her desire to help close the gender gap. She and her classmates were at Grace Hopper to attend sessions and scope out companies.
Some things have changed since Mutka's mother was in school, but women students still say they're woefully in the minority in their classes.
IaOng Moua, a senior at the University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, who chose computer science as a second bachelor's degree, said she feels lucky if she's enrolled in a class with one other girl.
"In class when I need help and I look around and I'm like, 'OK, those are all guys, the professor is a guy,' I have to step it up and just ask," she said, expressing a common feeling of isolation.
For Karen Taub, a Georgia Tech junior from Venezuela, she's not just dealing with being one of the only women in her classes, she's also one of the only Hispanics. That adds another layer of complexity when doing something like trying to find a mentor who shares your background. In the wider industry, we're not even totally sure how many women of color work at the tech giants, because they usually don't specifically report it.
A report from CNET sister site TechRepublic found that while many universities are doing a better job of attracting women to introductory computer science courses, their graduation rates remain low. There are plenty of off-ramps for women as they progress in their studies, such as lack of mentorship and support, and all the trials and tribulations that come with being a minority.
Those are problems that just don't seem to die.
Harvey Mudd College in Claremont, California, is trying to break those patterns in computer science education. Under President Maria Klawe, more than half the school's computer science majors are women.
"That's more or less what we expect from our graduates, that one, you're going to be very thoughtful about the places you pick, and two, you're going to fight if you see things you think aren't right and you're going to speak up," Klawe said over the phone a week before the conference.  
Being a minority in tech isn't easy.
During her opening keynote address, Melinda Gates, philanthropist and co-founder of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, talked about the double-edged sword of high-profile diversity scandals.
After all, in 2017 we've seen major shakeups in the venture capital world as women stepped forward to call out VCs like Chris Sacca and Dave McClure for sexual harassment. Susan Fowler's account of her time at Uber has shed a light on Silicon Valley's often-talked about bro culture.
Hearing all that is tough. But, Gates said, it's not necessarily a bad thing.
"In some ways, the bad news is actually good news," she said. "We're finally seeing consequences for bad behavior."
Most of the students I spoke with have some sense that staying in and succeeding in tech will likely take some extra gumption, and a certain mindset going in.
Whenever Michigan State sophomore Sarah Johanknecht speaks with a company, she makes a point of asking about its diversity efforts.
"I want to be respected and appreciated wherever I work," she said.
Candice Biamby, an information systems major at the University of Georgia, reminds herself of how she might be falling into certain habits. She said she'd read that if a man sees a job listing and has perhaps two of five requirements, he'll still apply for the job. Women are more likely to discount themselves and not apply if they don't meet every single requirement.  
"I'm just going to go for it," Biamby said. "I'm going to try my best. If they like me, they'll interview me. If they don't, you have nothing to lose."
Seeing scandals ripple through tech makes Eseosa Asiruwa, a senior at Hamilton College, feel determined.
"It makes me feel more resilient and [I want to] prove the naysayers wrong," she said.
"We've achieved a lot," former US Chief Technical Officer Megan Smith said Wednesday morning, looking into the audience. "And yet this year has been really striking in the places people have been falling down."
The specter of prejudice in the tech industry frequently haunts the corners of an event like Grace Hopper, but attendees refuse to let it overwhelm them.
While these young women haven't even fully launched themselves into the industry, they're already thinking about what they can do to help those who will come after them.
Mutka and Johanknecht, friends from Michigan State, are involved with a campus club for women in computing, where they do outreach at local schools, getting kids exposed to computer science at as young an age as possible. Through a Google-funded program called igniteCS, they volunteer at high schools, teaching basic programming languages. They're also helping to start a chapter of Girls Who Code, an organization with the mission of getting girls into tech.
"I think that's probably the biggest thing that we can do to improve the ratio at all these companies: just get more women into computer science," Mutka said.
As for Sundaresan, the UT Dallas student who felt so frustrated by that now ex-Googler's memo, she's also volunteering at underprivileged schools, and she's active in a group called Women Who Compute, which also organizes outreach opportunities and brings speakers to campus.
Ultimately, she's optimistic, particularly about members of her generation and how they'll treat each other in the years to come. She loves computer science and she's not abandoning ship.
"The world is changing," she said, "and it's time we all get on board with that fact."

As of this weekend drink-drive breathalyser will be 50 years old in the UK.
The first roadside breath-test was carried out by police on a motorist in Shropshire on 8 October, 1967. For context, that's when the Bee Gees were celebrating their number one hit "Massachusetts", Harold Wilson was prime minister and Milton Keynes had just been invented.
The original "blow in the bag" breathalyser was a simple device. It was initially used to confirm a police officer's suspicion that a driver might be drunk, which then had to be followed up by a blood or urine test at the station to provide evidential proof.
"In the first 12 months alone, there were 1000 fewer deaths and 11,000 fewer serious injuries on the roads - proving that the use of the 'drunkometer' was both necessary and justified", said Hunter Abbott, managing director of breathalyser firm AlcoSense Laboratories.
An electronic device was later developed, which allowed officers to accurately quantify an individual's alcohol level on the spot. Blood and urine tests were still required until infrared breath testing in the 1990s offered comparable accuracy.
The criteria for prosecution were less sophisticated before the test was introduced, with officers asking motorists to walk in a straight line or stand on one leg.


YouTube has tweaked the way its search engine works.
After sharp criticism, YouTube has made a change to its search engine, choosing to promote videos from more mainstream news outlets above fringe content. The change comes in the wake of the mass shooting in Las Vegas, after the video site allegedly promoted conspiracy theories.
YouTube, owned by Google, confirmed the change on Thursday. The Wall Street Journal earlier reported the news.
In the wake of the attack Sunday that left at least 59 dead and more than 500 people injured, some YouTube videos spread misinformation. For example, according to the Journal's report, when searching for "las vegas shooting," one video said there were multiple shooters involved, which law enforcement has refuted.
As of this writing, that same search query now yields videos from Vox, Fox News, NBC's Today and USA Today, in that order.
The tweak to YouTube's search results was previously planned, but the rollout was sped up due to the criticism. YouTube is the world's largest video site, with more than a billion visitors a month. This isn't the first time the site has gotten into trouble because of its automated systems. Earlier this year, YouTube faced an advertiser boycott after its ad tech placed advertisements next to extremist and hate content.
Google, YouTube's parent, faced a backlash after the Vegas shooting too. The search engine reportedly spread misinformation about the event in its "Top News" section.
Google has also been been criticized regarding false news during the 2016 election. Google is reportedly conducting an internal investigation to examine how Russian agents could have exploited its services to interfere in the election. The company has been invited by Congress to testify on a panel on the subject on Nov. 1. Google has not yet said whether it will participate.

Ghostface Killah is a co-founder of a cryptocurrency firm.
Wu-Tang Clan rapper Ghostface Killah has co-founded a cryptocurrency firm and hopes to raise $30 million during its initial coin offering, according to a CNBC report Wednesday.
Killah's firm, Cream Capital, apparently takes its name from Wu-Tang Clan's 1993 classic song "C.R.E.A.M." But instead of standing for "Cash rules everything around me," the acronym this time represents the trademarked Crypto Rules Everything Around Me, Cream Capital Chief Executive Brett Westbrook told CNBC.
The burgeoning market for cryptocurrencies, which has grown so quickly that one bitcoin was worth more than an ounce of gold in March, has seen digital currency entrepreneurs flocking to ICOs to create and sell digital tokens to investors, who include celebs such as Paris Hilton.
Still, regulators aren't taking to ICOs well. The practice, which Bloomberg said netted $1.6 billion in the last year, has prompted security concerns from the US Securities and Exchange Commission.
"I think the interest of celebrities is a bit of a double-edged sword," Westbrook told CNBC. "I personally think that anything that puts cryptocurrencies in front of the eyes of everyday people is a great thing for the markets overall.
"On the other hand, I believe it's important that celebrities know the importance of their endorsements and understand the underlying principles of blockchain technology," he said. "The last thing we need is a household name promoting what turns out to be a scam ICO."
Cream Capital plans to begin selling "Cream Dividend" tokens next month, which can be exchanged for Ether, the value tokens of the Ethereum blockchain.
"By 2020, we intend to capture more than half of the global cryptocurrency ATM market and make cryptocurrencies more accessible to the general public than ever before," Cream Capital said in a press release.

Debbie Sterling talked to the audience at the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing. 
When Debbie Sterling took her first prototype of GoldieBlox to the New York Toy Fair, she had an inauspicious realization.
"I walked in and it was a bunch of old white men in suits," Sterling told the audience at the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing conference in Orlando, Florida, on Thursday during her keynote address.
Sterling, who graduated from Stanford University with a degree in engineering, started GoldieBlox, the company, in 2012 in conjunction with a Kickstarter campaign after a heap of rejection from the toy fair. She raised $285,881, beating her goal of $150,000. It's a toy line that includes books, construction sets, action figures and more featuring characters, including a little girl named Goldie, who likes to solve problems and build things.
GoldieBlox is part of a move to get girls interested in science, technology, engineering and mathematics at an earlier age. Studies, like a March 2017 report from Microsoft, show that girls tend to lose interest in STEM subjects around the time they get to high school. It's yet another potential off ramp at a time when the numbers of women in tech are already low.  
I spoke with Sterling at the conference about ignoring her GPA, creating a character who isn't a princess, and teaching 4-year-olds the word "engineer."
Q: You've said that you didn't know what an engineer was until high school. Why is it important to make sure girls know what that is early in life?Sterling: The joke I always tell is I thought an engineer was a train driver. I think that may literally be because as a little kid, you have career flash cards and it's, like, here's the doctor, here's the nurse, here's the veterinarian and here's the engineer, and it's, like, a train conductor. The tough thing is engineering is so broad, but it's so important to introduce the concept of what an engineer is at a young age, because otherwise we're going to have so many kids, especially girls, just not even considering it when they go to college
You've talked about going to Stanford and being one of a few women in your classes. That can be off ramp for women -- what kept you in the major?Sterling: Prior to Stanford, I was a straight A student. Engineering was really the first time in my life I didn't get an A. Up until that point, I placed so much value on my grades that I think a lot of women just drop out because we're raised to be such perfectionists. What kept me in is I was genuinely interested in the material, and I understood I was just really far behind the other students. I'd come from a public school. I hadn't had any engineering training before and most of my other classmates -- these are kids who came from private schools and had already been doing robotics. I got to the point where I was, like, OK, I'm probably in the bottom third [of the class] and I accept that. I'm probably not going to get straight As and that's OK. I'm not going to worry about my GPA. I'm going to stick in here and do my best because I'm interested in this. As soon as I made that mental leap, that was one of the main things that kept me in. I stopped caring about my GPA.
The other one that kept me in was I had to get over my own ego and I had to finally just be willing to just raise my hand and say, "I don't get this." It sounds so obvious, but I feel like so many young girls and women, again, because we're raised to be such perfectionists, they don't want to admit when they don't know something. As soon as I started doing that, things started to change.
During the keynote, you talked about how Goldie isn't a nerd but she also isn't a princess. Why was striking a balance there important?Sterling: I was looking at the landscape of children's media, and there are so many stereotypes. Most of the girl characters are very shallow, materialistic, perfect, beautiful princesses who are into fashion. That's very aspirational. As a little girl, I aspire, I want to be beautiful, I want to have cool clothes, I want to be popular -- and that's an easy way for entertainment companies to create a character that girls will like. On the other hand, if you looked at the stereotypes of the smart girl, she's always the brunette with glasses in the corner with no friends. It felt, like, how do I create a character that every little girl wants to be, but she needs to be cooler than a princess. But does every little girl want to be a nerd? No.
GoldieBlox has a story component to the sets. What were some of the first messages or themes you wanted to get across to girls?Sterling: The first product that we put out, which we launched on Kickstarter, was GoldieBlox and the Spinning Machine. There were a bunch of things that I crammed in there. That toy probably targets girls between the ages of 4 and 6 and so maybe on the higher end, they're just starting to read. Some of the feedback I got early on from editors was, "You have the word 'engineering' in here. That word is too advanced, take it out." I insisted on leaving that word in because, to your point earlier, I want the word "engineer" to become a word that a 4-year-old or a 5-year-old would know.
Another one is I want girls to start becoming comfortable with failure and [the idea] that failure is just a natural part of being an engineer, or being an entrepreneur, an inventor, a leader. So in the first book, there's a moment where Goldie just doesn't know how to solve a problem.  
It's tricky because girls are raised to be so afraid of failure. The thing we've really tried to crack is here's a girl who actually fails all the time and that's OK. Sometimes she triumphs and sometimes she falls flat on her face, but she doesn't give up. Finding a way to tell that story and make that aspirational is the goal.

Technically Incorrect offers a slightly twisted take on the tech that's taken over our lives.
She's left him. But there's solace in Sonos. 
Sonos executives must be looking at vast tech companies making smart speakers and resisting the urge to hum a dirge.
Amazon launched its latest Echos last week. Google on Wednesday presented its new Homes -- including a charmingly unattractive Max that claims to offer quite a boom. Then there's Apple, whose music-based HomePod comes to market in December.
Sonos has a new speaker, too. The Sonos One, which the company claims work with Alexa now and will play nice with Google assistant and Siri next year.
The company's biggest concern, however, it that you'll simply forget all about Sonos, as the bigger brands toot their relentless horns. Sonos has, therefore, decided to appeal to your humanity and the heart that allegedly still beats within. 
Its released new ads for the One that press play on your feelings. They insist that Sonos is a mood enhancer.
In one, a teen is in his room, lamenting a lost love. Naturally, he plays lament-worthy music. But when he hears mom knocking, he goes hardcore. As every teen with self-esteem would.
Naturally, mom isn't without her human (and technological) smarts. She hears through his attempt at subterfuge.
In another ad, a more adult man isn't in the best of spirits. 
Do you see a pattern here?
He's made dinner at home. His lover doesn't turn up. She's working late. Of course she is. When she finally gets home, he doesn't become frustrated -- as so many lesser lover might. Instead, he unpauses a romantic song he was listening to earlier.
It really is this easy, apparently, to create loving harmony. And I thought relationships were hard.
Oh, this is all very nice.
It's attempting to preempt Apple's pretensions for HomePod to be "the new sound of home" by suggesting that Sonos is "the smart speaker for music lovers."
The problem is that even music lovers now treat music as something of a disposable commodity. There's so much of it around that songs often don't have the meaning they used to have in times of scarcity, when CDs were still magical.
Do these ads make a compelling case for Sonos? 
They're authentic to the brand. They use good music and highly televisual people.
But ads like these are like Tinder profiles. It's too easy to swipe left and dance to a different tune.

Apple CEO Tim Cook tweeted out a message honoring Steve Jobs on the sixth anniversary of Jobs' death. 
Six years is a lifetime in the technology industry, but Jobs' influence lives on. The visionary co-founder of the world's most-profitable company died October 5, 2011, after a long battle with pancreatic cancer. He was 56. 
Remembering Steve today. Still with us, still inspiring us. “Make something wonderful, and put it out there.” pic.twitter.com/7aOCPkwU0U
Jobs was always a charismatic and controversial leader, beloved by many (including millions of Apple fanboys throughout the world). He was equally known for his attention to detail and for a temperament that meant he didn't always play well with others. 
In his tweet, Cook used part of the same quote from Jobs he used last month when introducing the iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus and iPhone X at Apple's new Steve Jobs theater.  
There's lots of ways to be as a person, and some people express their deep appreciation in different ways. But one of the ways that I believe people express their appreciation to the rest of humanity is to make something wonderful and put it out there. And you never meet the people, you never shake their hands, you never hear their story or tell yours. But somehow in the act of making something with a great deal of care and love, something's transmitted there. And it's a way of expressing to the rest of our species, our deep appreciation. So we need to be true to who we are. And remember what's really important to us. That's what's going to keep Apple, Apple: is if we keep us, us.

A whopping 85 percent of North American office workers say it's important for their employer to provide technology that lets them work from home, according to a study published last month by IT solutions and services provider Softchoice. Seventy-four percent would leave their current jobs for one that allows them to work remotely more often, even if they didn't get paid more.
A majority of employees want to be fitted with technology that lets them work from anywhere, according to a recent Softchoice study.
Mobile devices and cloud services have made working from home a more viable and desirable option for many employees. The Softchoice study, which surveyed 1,000 full-time North American office workers who use a computer or mobile device for most of their workday, found 83 percent of office workers already use technology to collaborate with people who aren't in the same room or office. 
If companies want to recruit and retain top talent, especially with a growing technology skills gap, they'll likely have to adopt a model that caters more to employees' interests and demands.
"To stay competitive, we have to position ourselves as an organization that these skilled technologists want to work for," said Francis Li, vice president of IT at Softchoice."That includes being able to support a more flexible work environment, and, potentially, employing individuals that are not necessarily situated in the offices that your company operates within."
Tech companies including Amazon, Dell and Adobe were listed among Flexjobs' top 100 companies offering remote jobs in 2017. Other companies, including IBM in May and Yahoo back in 2013, made headlines for calling remote workers back into the office.
"Some companies are concerned that there will be a reduction in coordination, innovation or interaction when people are not in the same space," said Jennifer Deal, senior research scientist at the Center for Creative Leadership.
Allowing employees to work remotely also means organizations have to make the right devices and technology available to them.
The survey found that only around 55 percent of employers provided laptops, 31 percent provided smartphones and 19 percent provided tablets to their workers. Eighteen percent of workers say a lack of the right technology is the reason they can't work from home.
Even when the right new technology is made available, one in three employees say they get little to no training on how to use it. In addition, 78 percent of workers who utilize collaboration technology frequently experience technical difficulties, from having trouble remotely joining a meeting to having connection quality issues.
More than half of employees surveyed have brought their personal devices to the office instead of using the equipment their employers provide. Some cite inadequate or outdated office technology, while others say they're more efficient working off of their personal devices.  
Millennials, who are now the largest demographic in the workforce, are twice as likely to feel more productive working from home than Baby Boomers. They're also twice as likely to feel that their employer-issued work device is outdated, the report states.
"If you're going to fill your technology gap, you definitely have to take a look at the Millennial segment of the population, as they're going to be your only talent pool at some point, along with the generations that follow them," Li said.
There's also the fear that technology will "take over." One in four office workers are worried that technology will entirely replace their jobs within five years. The jobs they feel are most at risk are accounting, administration, IT, sales and human resources.
While there are entire roles being automated -- particularly those at big companies with a small number of highly repetitive tasks, like in IT -- for the most part, intelligent automation is replacing specific tasks, not entire roles, said Stanton Jones, director and principal analyst at technology research and advisory firm ISG.
"In most cases, we see companies using this as an opportunity to make people more productive, because when a person is paired up with a robot, they can take on more work or use the freed-up time to focus on higher-value activities," Jones said.

A few blocks behind the Tate Modern and Shakespeare's Globe theater is a place few tourists, or even Londoners, ever see. Keep going past the Tesco Express and through an unmarked driveway to reach a car park jammed with black cabs.
It's one of the last spots in all of London where drivers of the city's famous taxis can have a rest, get their cabs washed and buy parts at an adjacent store. If they're hungry, there's a cash-only cafe in what looks like a double-wide mobile home. Open 24 hours, the Great Suffolk Street Taxi Cafe is a place for comfort food and conversation.
London cabbies are famous for being opinionated. These days, Uber is a popular topic.
After Transport for London (TfL), the British capital's transport regulator, refused on Sept. 22 to renew Uber's license to operate, we visited the cafe to see what cabbies thought of the news. We were expecting elation, but the reality was a mix of defiance, quiet resignation and "bring it on." To many of the drivers, Uber, which arrived in London in 2012, is destroying a proud and historic tradition that plays a vital and iconic role in the city's life. Competition is fine, they say, but fair competition is not what this is.
Sean Paul Day, a taxi driver for 18 years, says Uber is destroying a proud and historic local culture. He's also a co-founder of a taxi-hailing app called TaxiApp.
The car park is a busy place. Drivers socialize in the patchy afternoon sun and a steady stream of cabs (officially called Hackney carriages) arrive and park at the disused gas pumps of an old service station.  
There's not a lot to capture your attention inside the spartan cafe, with its hard plastic chairs and bare tables. A TV plays Sky Sports. The menu is equally spartan: instant coffee for £1, a full English breakfast (served all day) for £5, and a selection of classic British desserts like sticky toffee pudding, jam roly-poly and spotted dick. We're only minutes from some of London's poshest restaurants, but this feels miles away. (The Taxi Cafe is open to the public.) 
The taxi rest area is located in a courtyard car park surrounded by buildings.
Around several of the tables, groups of cabbies enjoy their lunch with few moments of silence. It takes a while to break into the conversation at the next table, but just a brief mention of Uber wins us an invitation to sit and share a cuppa and a chinwag.  
Sean Paul Day, a driver of 18 years, has the table's center seat. Tall and animated, he speaks rapidly and gets straight to the point. "The KGB would have given their right arm to have Uber's power," he says while eating a large plate of fish and chips (at £9, one of the pricier dishes on the menu). Uber "is a global, heavily financed profiteer going against a local taxi trade. As big as the taxi service is in London, it's still local."
Great meetings in London, including w some of the drivers who rely on our app.  Determined to make things right in this great city! pic.twitter.com/QLgqon30yT
Uber has appealed TfL's decision and will be allowed to operate normally during that process. On Oct. 3, the company's new CEO Dara Khosrowshahi, who had already apologized to Londoners for "messing up," visited London to hold talks with the city's transit officials. In a tweet that same day, he said he was "determined to make things right in this great city!" TfL also released a statement on Tuesday characterizing the talks as "constructive" and said that more discussion would continue in the coming weeks.
The global versus local debate is hardly unique to Uber, but it exemplifies a common theme we heard over and again. None of these taxi drivers is angry at Uber's drivers; rather, their beef is with Uber as a company. George Vyse, who's been driving for 47 years and buying and selling used black cabs for 40 years, is outraged at how little Uber pays its drivers, describing it as "slave labor."
Black-cab drivers are self-employed, meaning they can keep all the money they earn from fares. Uber, on the other hand, takes up to 25 percent of every fare. The company doesn't openly speak about average earnings, but last year union GMB won a case against Uber because one driver was found to be earning less than minimum wage after the company had taken its cut. With a £2.60 flat-rate base fare for any cab ride, black-cab drivers need to pick up only three passengers an hour to earn the national minimum wage of £7.50.
The Great Suffolk Taxi cafe is completely unassuming, both inside and out.
Of all the people we spoke with, Vyse was the most vehemently opposed to Uber as a company, calling it "the cancer of trade" ("trade" is the term cabbies use for driving a taxi). In the window of his office -- a small trailer situated beside the cafe -- he proudly displays a cartoon depicting Calvin of "Calvin and Hobbes" fame urinating on the company's name. His objections? There's a whole list, top of which is the way he says Uber plays fast and loose with the safety of passengers by not conducting proper background checks on its drivers. (Uber has yet to respond to a request for comment.)
Along with enjoying a reputation for good chats and an encyclopedic knowledge of London, Vyse says black-cab drivers are highly trusted, with an unblemished safety record.
According to statistics from London's Metropolitan Police, 19 licensed private-hire drivers were investigated for sexual offenses in 2014, with five convictions. The following year, 28 private-hire drivers were investigated, with nine convictions. Since 2000, two black-cab drivers have been convicted of sexual offenses: John Warboys in 2009 and David Perry in 2015.
"If you take the majority of drivers out there, including me, we've done the job proper," says Vyse. "We abide by the rules and regulations." Leaning back in his chair, the slim-built Londoner, who looks much younger than his 78 years, peers at us pointedly through his clear-rimmed glasses. "You couldn't be any more straighter than George Vyse." 
George Vyse says taxi drivers have followed the rules. Uber, he says, should follow them as well.
The emergence of a couple of bad apples rocked the industry and caused upset among drivers, he added. But that's nothing compared with Uber's attitude to safety, which has resulted in widespread anger. He's seen more protests in the last two to three years by cabbies than in the 50 years preceding Uber's arrival in the city.
As for Uber, 32 of its drivers were accused of rape or sexual assault in the previous year alone, according to freedom of information data obtained by The Sun newspaper. Earlier this year, existing fears about Uber were exacerbated when the Metropolitan Police Force accused the company of failing to report sex attacks. Now TfL has piled on, accusing Uber of being careless with Londoners' safety by failing to institute proper background vetting.
A sign in Vyse's office makes his opinions on Uber perfectly clear.
Back inside the cafe, Day echoes Vyse's sentiments, albeit in a calmer tone. "Uber give the impression that they are reputable, safe, legitimate, when in fact they are in contravention of the regulations," he says. "There's a lot of anger there. It hasn't been directed at the drivers, I must say. ... They've just taken an opportunity."
Mick Smith, a driver for 28 years, was sitting at an adjacent table in the cafe, but he kept leaning in during our conversation to interject. After a few minutes, he moved over to join us. His major complaint? Uber's cheaper fares are possible only because it's a large company with deep pockets.
"The only reason Uber is cheap is because they have billions in investment," he says. "Uber is running at a loss because of it." (Uber reported a loss of $645 million in the second quarter of this year.)
I hate black cabs. Absolutely ripped off my parents 2 days ago coming from Stratford to my home. A £5 journey on Uber was £11. #saveuber
Uber and black cabs have different fare structures, but a six-mile ride across London lasting 30 minutes can be as much as £10 cheaper on Uber than with a taxi. Of course, prices vary widely depending on traffic conditions and time of day.
Some of Uber's nearly 850,000 customers who've signed a petition backing the company said it's the only form of transport they can afford. "Uber offers more value for money than any other," said petitioner Daniel Clover. "People have a right to choose."
"I have often experienced rude and expensive London cabbies but have always been treated courteously by the Uber drivers," said another, Yvonne White. "I know up front what it's going to cost, I don't need cash and I have a choice."
If cabbie opinions against Uber are varied, their ire against TfL is universal. The refusal to renew Uber's license is welcome, drivers say, but TfL should have been properly regulating the company in the first place. TfL declined to comment on whether it could have done more to regulate Uber in the past.
Once again, no one is more critical of TfL than Vyse, who's been an activist and a spokesperson for his colleagues in the trade for many years. "I suppose they'd call me a troublemaker," he says. "But I'm the kind of person who stands up for what I believe is right."
"It's careless that they have been allowed to operate," he adds. "The people, the body to blame is TfL ... not Uber, because TfL was licensing them." As he sees it, TfL gave in to political pressure by making room for Uber, but quickly got out of its depth as the company flouted regulation after regulation. "Uber is a monster that's out of control."
Paul Luchford, who's been driving for 15 years, agrees. "If Uber won't conform to the regulations," he says, "[TfL] is just as much to blame." The way he sees it, it's not just black-cab drivers who are suffering from the influx of Uber. "Uber aren't just undercutting us, they're undercutting the whole private-hire industry."
Uber drivers need to pass criminal background, English language and medical checks to secure a "private hire" license from TfL, but that license comes with fewer requirements than a license to drive a black cab. For example, though Uber drivers are tested on how to read a map, they don't have to learn The Knowledge, a 152-year-old system for memorizing every street and landmark in a six-mile area of central London.
Mick Smith defends The Knowledge and says Uber drivers aren't competing on an a level playing field.
The Knowledge requires drivers to be able to navigate between any two points in London without referring to a map or GPS. Learning The Knowledge can take two to four years, and drivers must pass a stringent exam administered by TfL. It's a grueling, demanding process, unmatched anywhere in the world.
"I'm upset because because what I had to go through now comes on your phone," Smith says. "It's not about competition, it's about going through the same process."
Despite his grievance, Smith is a staunch defender of The Knowledge. He says it always wins over GPS, because it forces him to rely on instinct and the map in his brain. He believes it's also safer because his eyes are on the road rather than on a screen.
"You always need a reference point beyond GPS," he says. "I'm not a slave to a screen."
Smith also believes that TfL handles passenger complaints unfairly. If a passenger complains about a black-cab driver, TfL typically follows up with the driver personally. But complaints against an Uber driver can be referred to the company instead.
Though Uber's fans in London have cited the ride-hailing service's embrace of technology as a reason they use it, the taxi industry is far from being a group of Luddites.
Thanks @TfL and @SadiqKhan for putting my dad out of business just because you don't like innovation. Get with the times! #uberlondon
The use of apps like Gett and MyTaxi to find passengers and process credit card payments is now widespread, and it started before Uber arrived. In 2011, a small group of taxi drivers co-founded Hailo, an app that lets people find taxis on their phone (MyTaxi absorbed it last year). Even if they use an app, TfL requires drivers to rent or buy credit machines for their taxis.
"[Apps] are a sign of the times, I accept that," Mark Thomson, a driver of 23 years, tells us while eating a plate of mushrooms and beans on toast. "I'll get work without them, so it's my choice to use them or not."
Some drivers even acknowledge that Uber's arrival in London has forced them to adapt for the better.
George Shipton, who's been driving for over 14 years, is determined not to let Uber ruin his livelihood -- in fact, he credits the company with forcing him to up his game. He adds to his income by allowing a high-end fashion brand to advertise on his cab. He's also a registered London tour guide. "I diversified," Shipton says. "I made a personal decision. My decision is to come out fine. It's all I've ever known. It's how I've always been."
If your cab is dirty, you can have it washed while you're getting some lunch.
Last year, Day and seven other drivers even started their own ride-hailing app, called TaxiApp. Unlike Gett and MyTaxi, which are largely funded by investors outside of London, TaxiApp is owned and operated solely by local drivers.
That means passenger fares go directly into the driver's pocket, and the app keeps the money circulating in the local economy, says Day, who serves as TaxiApp's communications manager. Also, because Taxiapp's fares are based on the meter rather than on a fixed price, passengers will experience a transparent payment system without surcharges. 
"We don't see the other [ride-hailing] apps as being too different from Uber," Day says. "They are corporations with bottom lines that go to shareholders. TaxiApp is owned, run by and financed by drivers."
Day says more than 1,500 drivers now use the app. They must pay £5 per week to be a member, but TaxiApp doesn't take a commission from passenger fares.
Ask Vyse if he'd put money on Uber failing to win its appeal to get its license renewed. "I believe they will, and I hope I'm right, sincerely," he says. "I'll be very very upset if I'm wrong. They can't put it right. They're now grovelling: 'Mr Mayor, what do you want us to do? We'll bend over backwards.' A bit too late now, isn't it?"
For his part, London Mayor Sadiq Khan has TfL's back and defended the regulatory body's decision on multiple occasions, including in an op-ed for the Guardian last month. He also criticized Uber for being "aggressive" in its response to TfL's decision, reminding the public that the company has an army of PR people and lawyers at its disposal.
Providing an innovative service must not be at the expense of Londoners safety. My response to @TfL's Uber decision. https://t.co/iEUal9VLU3 pic.twitter.com/B9V0mEKrWr
The fight isn't over, though. Uber has many supporters on its side, including politicians and the Londoners who've signed that petition for the company to be allowed to stay.
Some petitioners have acknowledged that Uber can improve to build passenger trust.
"[Uber] provides a very efficient and cheap service which is a great alternative to other modes of transport," wrote David Maclure. "The drivers do however need to be checked out more thoroughly for driving competency and the security of passengers."
Sasha Simmons argues that Uber needs to provide a safer environment for women passengers.
But even if Uber is forced out of the city, US rival Lyft is reportedly eyeing a UK expansion, which means another ride-hailing app ready to step into its shoes. How would Vyse feel about that?
He's pragmatic. "We can't take everybody on. I mean, there's so many people out there now," he says, in reference to passengers. "But if a company comes in, it's got to be controlled like we're controlled."
Many of those we asked about Lyft seemed similarly open to the company's potential presence in London -- at least in theory -- while some called for a cap on the number of drivers.
"Nature abhors a vacuum and I think someone else would come in," says Shipton. "What needs changing, and it needs changing for us as well, is there needs to be a ceiling of numbers." London's streets are already "creaky" with the number of cars they must bear, he added. From 2015 to 2017, 108,700 new taxis and private-hire vehicles, including Uber drivers, received licenses in London, a 27 percent increase over the previous two-year period.
@TfL - @Uber is the one part of my journey that is cheap, reliable and available 24/7. Ridiculous decision. #saveuber
The taxi drivers we spoke with agree that better and more consistent enforcement of regulations is the best way to reconcile the rifts across the industry.
They also recognize that not every driver in London can be a black-cab driver -- the difficulty of passing The Knowledge sees to that. Taxi drivers also must buy or rent a black cab, and they pay more fees than Uber drivers (£1,023 vs £438) to initially acquire their license.  London's cabbies proudly boast they're the best in the world and they want to remain so -- not instead of technology, but in spite of it.
"We've got to be careful because -- never forget the reason why we've got London cabs in the first place," says Shipton, referring to why The Knowledge was created. "It's because cab drivers were getting lost at the Great Exhibition in 1851. They couldn't find Hyde Park," he says, pausing to laugh. "Much like Uber cabs can't find it now."


Technically Incorrect offers a slightly twisted take on the tech that's taken over our lives.
Their owners prefer iPhones?
What does your choice of smart speaker say about you? 
Other than you have little regard for your own privacy, that is.
If you choose a Google Home speaker, does that mean you drift Android-ward? And what if you bought an Amazon Echo?
Well, let me me tell you. I have just been made smarter by a piece of research from securities intelligence consultancy Consumer Intelligence Research Partners. 
It chatted with 300 Amazon Echo and Google Home owners between July 11 and 27.
It concluded that those who own an Echo -- which reminds me of the result of an ill-starred relationship between an air-purifier and a lipstick -- have a penchant for Cupertino.
Of those surveyed, 55 percent of Echo users have an iPhone. The remainder have Android. Conversely, 75 percent of those who bought the oversized salt cellar known as Google Home are committed to Android phones. 
Josh Lowitz, partner and co-founder of CIRP, insisted in a press release that the proportion of iPhone owners among Echo users was higher than the phone's share of the US market. That stands at roughly 34 percent.
As for the proportion of Android users among Home owners, that was merely consistent with Android's share of the US phone market, he said. (Numbers vary as to how big Android's share is. Some place it at around the 55 percent mark.)
Lowitz didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.
When it comes to tablets, Echo owners also skew toward Apple, says the research. 49 percent have an iPad, while 25 percent own an Amazon Fire tablet.
It's easy, but perhaps not best, to draw deep conclusions from these numbers. Yes, it appears that the Echo has sold better to iPhone owners than to Android owners, which might, indeed, be expected. There are, though, far more Echos out there, a situation that Google's presentation today of new Home devices attempted to redress.
In recent research, CIRP estimated that Amazon had sold three times as many Echos as Google had sold Homes.
Still, Lowitz himself admitted that it was early in the proceedings. 
"Even though Amazon has sold 15 million Echo devices, Apple has an installed base of over 140 million iPhones in the US, so Echo hasn't penetrated deeply into the iPhone ownership group," he said. "Yet, this initial data suggests that Amazon has gained a meaningful foothold among Apple's US customer base."
What will happen, though, when Apple's HomePod comes along in December? It retails at a far higher price -- $349 -- than do Amazon's devices. 
Does that mean iPhone owners will immediately express loyalty and throw their cheap Echos away? 
Well, surely.


Technically Incorrect offers a slightly twisted take on the tech that's taken over our lives.
Does it call to you? Do you have clothes to model?
Did you, an iPhone aficionado, look at the Pixel 2 and salivate?
Please don't worry. There's an ad for that.
No sooner had Google released its new Pixel 2 phone than it uploaded a video to show how easy it is to switch.
It doesn't, oddly, show a slightly gauche tech type talking you through the motions, as if you were thoroughly halfwitted.
Instead, here's YouTuber Weylie in a remarkably, well, tight video that preaches the power of change.
The Pixel 2 is, it seems, change you can believe in. 
Weylie changes things in her life all the time. It's all about keeping things new and fresh, apparently.
The change is, she insists, "super smooth," as long as you follow her steps. 
Honestly, it's so smooth that Weylie has time to freshen up her makeup and even model a few clothes along the way. 
Oddly, her iPhone has a matching white case. Slightly froufrou, if I may say so. Does this mean it's, well, hers? I daren't ask.
She's certainly very au fait with its operations, as she instructs you to turn off FaceTime and iMessage and unencrypt everything -- especially any work elements that happen to be inserted on your phone.
Changing operating systems has always seemed like a painful idea to me. For its part, Apple insists that switching from Android to iPhone is as easy as walking from one side of a TV screen to another.
Still, if Pixel 2 had moved me to rapture -- with, for example, its new wireless headphones on a string that simultaneously translate when Japanese people are swearing at you -- then you could find a much worse instructor than Weylie.
On the other hand, I fancy one or two people might worry about the fact that the video is vertical. 
Oh, didn't you know? That's an example of change. Vertical is the new, new thing.

Technically Incorrect offers a slightly twisted take on the tech that's taken over our lives.
A touch on the creepy side?
Stop me if you've heard this one before.
Lifelogging, surveillance and self-obsession walk into a bar....
Oh, you watched the Google show on Wednesday too, did you?
I was moved by many things in it. The hairs on the top of my back, however, were oddly made erect by something called Google Clips.
At first, my hairs thought this was a new trimmer. For, you know, the hairs themselves. 
It turns out, however, that it's tiny camera that you carry around, clip to things -- or even lie on the floor -- and hope it captures you in memorable unguarded moments. 
Because, of course, you've always regretted not having someone record your charming scratching, nose-picking and Corn Flakes chomping.
One ad for the Clips demands that you "be in the moment." But how can you do that when you know there's a camera watching your every, um, moment?
Worse -- or, more delightful, depending on your perspective -- this camera has a mind of its own. It uses a machine-learning algorithm called Moment IQ to "automatically" determine what photos you want taken. 
Yes, it's a wedding photographer for your whole life. Or something that will capture certain times you definitely don't want captured and helpfully -- and automatically -- send them off to your phone. 
The ad, however, doesn't seem to show too many natural moments. Instead, we get a child hamming it up for the camera and a family seeming to pose for pictures. In a natural, unguarded way, of course.
But Google doesn't stop there. 
It's released another ad that encourages you to "get creative with Google Clips." Which is odd, as it seems to be that Google Clips is perfectly capable of being creative all on its own.
Still, here you're told to "get close to your subject" and then "put Google Clips somewhere fun." 
Your definition of "somewhere fun" might be different from, say, other people's. Or even kids'. Which might make for some interesting surveillance experiments on the part of every member of your family.
Yes, an LED light flashes when it's on.
But there are quite a few gadgets around the house that do that, ones that you're oblivious to. 
The idea, Google says, is to "get a fresh angle on things."
Google declined to comment. I understand, however, that the company believes it has been thoughtful about the privacy aspects. The device only records 7-second clips, isn't capable of long-distance shooting and anything it shoots stays on the phone.
Hasn't technology, though, already given us enough opportunities for fresh angles? It seems not. You must seek to discover more of yourself -- and a lot more of other people -- and perhaps even project it all into the world. 
Oddly, I can't help thinking that this is gorgeous reverse psychology. Google's whole ethos actually involves getting every possible angle on you. 
Still, it's fascinating that it believes families will be desperate to capture these alleged moments with their tiny, mute GoPro that's the result of a brief relationship with a surveillance camera. 
But what if it captures mommy kissing Santa Claus? 
Wait, that's not Santa Claus?
Updated 6:05 p.m. PT: Adds response from Google.


Alphabet's Sidewalk Labs is reportedly negotiating to build a digital-city project along 12 acres of Toronto waterfront property,
A unit of Google parent company Alphabet is nearing a deal to develop a high-tech urban space on Toronto's waterfront, according to a report Wednesday by The Wall Street Journal.
Alphabet's Sidewalk Labs would direct development of the so-called digital-city project, which would be located on a 12-acre section of Toronto's eastern waterfront, the Journal reported. Specific plans and cost weren't available, but the project is expected to win approval this month from the board of Waterfront Toronto, the agency that oversees city development along the shore of Lake Ontario, according to the report.
Google declined to a comment on the report.
Alphabet created Sidewalk Labs in 2015 with the goal of making cities function better. The startup is focused on developing technology around urban living, like how to make transportation more efficient and how to reduce energy use.
The startup is led by Dan Doctoroff, former CEO of Bloomberg and deputy mayor of economic development and rebuilding for the City of New York.
Google has become increasingly ambitious about expanding its scope of products beyond its juggernaut search engine. Its search and advertising business is still the most dominant in the world, making more than $50 billion a year. But as the Internet evolves, co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin have been looking to where future revenue streams will come from. The company has made big bets on everything from smartphones to wearable devices to driverless cars.
Solving for XX: The industry seeks to overcome outdated ideas about "women in tech."
Special Reports: All of CNET's most in-depth features in one easy spot.


If you watched Google's Pixel 2 event, you may have noticed something other than just the launch of several new gadgets: the presence of more female presenters.
Four, to be exact.
That's not to say the bar was set particularly high in previous years -- at last year's Pixel event, there were two female presenters -- but it signals that Google is starting to "walk the walk" when it comes to boosting representation of women. At this year's Google I/O, there were also four female presenters, up one from 2015 and 2016, and double the number from 2013 and 2014.
There were six male presenters at Wednesday's Pixel event.
Isabelle Olsson, Google's lead designer for home hardware, was one of four women presenters at Google's Pixel event on Wednesday.   
Earlier this year, Google was embroiled in controversy after former company engineer James Damore wrote a manifesto arguing that women are underrepresented in tech because of "biological causes" rather than bias and discrimination. Silicon Valley companies, largely dominated by white men, have long grappled with the issue of diversity. Former Uber CEO Travis Kalanick was ousted in June following an internal investigation of sexual harassment allegations, and in July, venture capitalists including Dave McClure of 500 Startups admitted to behaving inappropriately toward women.  
The presenters at Wednesday's Pixel event included Isabelle Olsson, lead designer for home hardware; Sabrina Ellis, senior director of product management; Aparna Chennapragada, product director; and Nest CTO Yoky Matsuoka.

As I looked into the eye of the bright pink giant grizzly bear, I knew this wasn't a normal phone launch event.
Google has just taken the wraps off its brand new Pixel 2 phone and new additions to its smart home lineup in San Francisco. (Here's literally everything Google announced.) But I was following the news from a "satellite" event in London. 
And it was quite a different experience than what the world was streaming from California.















Sundar Pichai, Google's CEO, kicked off the event with a statement for the victims affected by the mass shooting in Las Vegas.
Google is thinking of victims in Las Vegas but keeping quiet on accidentally spreading fake news about the mass shooting.
At Google's event in San Francisco on Wednesday, CEO Sundar Pichai opened with a statement on Las Vegas.
"Our hearts and prayers are with the victims," he said on stage. Pichai didn't mention anything about failing to stop fake news about the shooting from showing up in Google search results.
Google was criticized after the search engine surfaced a 4Chan thread accusing the wrong person of being the gunman behind Monday's mass shooting in Las Vegas. This comes about six months after Google pledged to fight fake news with tools like its "fake check" tags and tweaks to its search results.
Internet trolls and wannabe sleuths originally pinned the deadliest mass shooting in US history on a person named Geary Danley, and Google's algorithm picked up the internet chatter. It placed a  /pol/ thread from the 4Chan site as one of the top news stories if you searched the name.
But Geary Danley wasn't the gunman. Police identified the shooter as Stephen Paddock. Fake news surrounding the shooting rapidly spread across platforms like Facebook and Twitter, and Google's algorithm fell victim to the plague of hoaxes.
In a statement on Monday, Google said it was looking further into the issue and that its algorithm had messed up when it linked the 4Chan thread. It's unclear why the search engine even considered the forum a news source.
"Unfortunately, early this morning we were briefly surfacing an inaccurate 4chan website in our Search results for a small number of queries," Google said in its statement. "Within hours, the 4chan story was algorithmically replaced by relevant results. This should not have appeared for any queries, and we'll continue to make improvements to prevent this from happening in the future."

Melinda Gates spoke about diversity in tech.
The next Bill Gates might not look anything like Bill Gates -- and probably shouldn't.
That was one of Melinda Gates' key messages as she spoke at the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing conference, a three-day conference that brings together thousands of students and professionals to hear speakers and attend session both focused on professional development and straightforward tech topics like open source computing and software engineering.
"Not every good idea comes in a hoodie," she told the crowd during Wednesday's opening keynote.
She joked that tech is often seen as a sea of white dudes, and then showed a slide with a grid filled with her husband's face to laughter from the audience.
Gates started working at Microsoft back in 1987. These days she's a high-profile philanthropist. While much of her work is as part of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, last September, she also launched an independent initiative focused on women in tech. She's been vocal about the importance of things like mentorship for women, and even the impact the gender imbalance in tech could have on developing technologies like artificial intelligence.    
On Wednesday, she put the onus on the attendees, issuing a call for those in the audience to commit to helping 10 women get into or stay in tech. It's going to take opening the floodgates, she said, to create a diverse and dynamic industry.
It's an important time for tech to get more diverse. She talked about the need for having a wide range of people influence the next generation of tech like artificial intelligence. Those systems tend to reflect the people who create them, so the more different perspectives that are fed in, the more effective AI can be.
Gates also talked about the amount of coverage the lack of diversity in tech has gotten in recent times -- it can be demoralizing for girls getting into the industry; she even made a quick reference to ex-Googler James Damore's memo which posited that women are biologically unsuited for tech.
"Who says 'sign me up for that?'" she said.
But sometimes bad news is good news. "We're finally seeing consequences for bad behavior," she said.

Amazon staff go about their day.
European regulators have slapped Amazon with a bill for 250 million euros (about £220 million, $294 million or AU$370 million) in unpaid taxes. 
The online giant was found by the European Commission to have an illegal deal with Luxembourg since 2003, which allowed the US company to move money between its subsidiaries so profits were taxed there instead of a country with a higher corporate rate. 
"Almost three quarters of Amazon's profits were not taxed," said European Commissioner Margrethe Vestager in an official statement. "Amazon was allowed to pay four times less tax than other local companies subject to the same national tax rules. This is illegal under EU State aid rules. Member States cannot give selective tax benefits to multinational groups that are not available to others."
An Amazon spokesperson told CNET the company disputes the allegation of special treatment from Luxembourg, and will consider an appeal.
Amazon shouldn't have any problem stumping up the cash, having turned over revenue of $35.7 billion in the first quarter of 2017 alone.
The ruling is the latest example of European watchdogs going after tax avoidance by US companies.Last year, for instance, Apple was told to pay a whopping 13 billion euros in back taxes. That's around £11 billion, $14.5 billion or AU$18 billion.

It's Complicated: This is dating in the age of apps. Having fun yet?



In the near future, we'll be paying for goods and services with our phones rather than our credit cards, says a report from the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD).
In 2014, 51 percent of payments in developed countries were made with credit cards. However, that number is expected to dip to 46 percent in 2019 as advances in technology will make it easier for people to pay for things with their phones.  This won't apply to developing nations, where cash is still the preferred choice.
In places like Egypt, e-commerce purchases are still cash-on-delivery. But Kenya, which has seen a rise in mobile payments, still defaults to cash. However, a recent global survey by the UNCTAD found that those in Kenya say mobile payments are their preferred choice for online transactions.
And if you're wondering what it'd be like to rely only on mobile payments, China is looking to be the technology's shining beacon. The country has embraced services such as WeChat Pay and Alipay, with the latter used by 68 percent of online shoppers. Both services have handled close to $3 trillion in 2016, according to TechCrunch.
In the future, blockchain technology will be used for cross-border payments, which may help ease expensive transaction fees from banks to boot, as these services are peer-to-peer, secure and less expensive. That said, it's not the preferred choice yet, but the report notes that improvements to security and the size of the minimum transaction will cause adoption to increase.

Disney CEO Robert Iger speaks onstage at the Vanity Fair New Establishment Summit on Tuesday. 
Disney is moving forward in its mission to launch new subscription services starting next year. 
The company said in August that movies from Walt Disney Studios and Pixar will no longer be available on Netflix starting in 2019 because of its own upcoming service. It also said an ESPN-branded video-streaming service will launch in 2018. This comes as cable TV sees falling subscriptions and people's watching habits continually shift in the age of new media.
Chairman and CEO Robert Iger said Tuesday that accepting these permanent changes in viewing habits helped drive Disney's decision. He was interviewed on stage by Vanity Fair special correspondent Nick Bilton at the magazine's New Establishment Summit in Los Angeles. 
"At some point, we felt it would be necessary for us to not only be disrupted, but to disrupt our business ourselves," Iger said. "We felt that we were no longer seeing a speed bump of disruption ... What we were seeing instead was real, profound and permanent change."
Iger said the mobile-friendly sports product, which will likely launch in the spring, will have 10,000 extra live sporting events. Viewers can purchase a monthly subscription to access them.
"Eventually, that app may possibly become the only way you watch ESPN," Iger said.
The Disney-branded movie product will feature Disney, Pixar, Star Wars and Marvel films. The company will also make original films for the platform that won't be released in theaters. 
As part of the reveal of these services earlier this year, Disney also said it had acquired majority ownership of streaming video and internet services company BAMTech.

If you're not into Snap's Spectacles, don't give up on the company's creations just yet. 
There'll be more to come from Snap on the hardware front, said co-founder and CEO Evan Spiegel on Tuesday at Vanity Fair's New Establishment Summit in Los Angeles.   
"Hardware is going to be an important vehicle for delivering our customer experience, maybe in a decade. But if we believe that it's going to be important in a decade, we don't want to be starting a decade from now," Spiegel said. "We took that first initial leap with Spectacles, and we're excited to see where it goes from here."
Spectacles, which are glasses embedded with a camera, flopped in sales in the second quarter at $5.4 million, compared to more than $8 million in sales in the first quarter. Those sales represented about 0.02 percent of Snap's 143 million daily active users. But Spiegel said Spectacles "outsold our expectations."
"We're just beginning to dabble in hardware," he added.
Spiegel also announced an art collaboration with Jeff Koons, in which users can see Koons' sculptures through new Snapchat Lenses. These virtual art exhibits are landing in parks and landmarks across the US, Canada, the UK, Paris, Australia and Brazil starting Tuesday, according to Snapchat. More locations will follow.
Snapchat launched the Lenses feature, which adds real-time special effects and sounds to what's normally seen through a camera, around two years ago. The feature has also been used with advertisers and brands like Bud Light, where a vendor appears and offers users a can of beer.
Spiegel also backed the company's decision to go public earlier this year.
"Going public was really the right thing for the company, and certainly the right thing for the time," he said. "We saw a tremendous benefit to transitioning our investor base from short-term venture investors to long-term investors." 
Snap faces stark competition from Facebook and its photo sharing app, Instagram. In August, Snap said it had 173 million total users, while Instagram announced its Stories platform had 250 million daily users.
Spiegel was careful in answering a question on how "obsessed" he is with Facebook from moderator Walter Isaacson, president and CEO of The Aspen Institute.
"What we found by focusing relentlessly on empowering creativity is that our customers tend to show us what's next, our customers show us what they want," Speigel said. "That's how I think we've been able to deliver the future to so many of our customers."

Logging Out: Welcome to the crossroads of online life and the afterlife.


Dropbox's logo is changing. Kinda.
What do you do when Steve Jobs says you're destined to fail?
That's what Dropbox co-founder Drew Houston had to answer after meeting Apple's co-founder seven years ago.
Houston's startup made waves when he unveiled his storage service in 2008, offering a dead-simple way to upload and save your files in the cloud and then synchronize them between your computers. At 27, he was talking to the most influential name in tech -- and his own personal hero.
"It was an interesting conversation because he said he liked our products," Houston (pronounced "how-stun") later recounted to Forbes. "I can't think of much higher praise than that."
But Apple's co-founder wasn't convinced Dropbox was destined for success. Jobs wanted to buy the company, likely to integrate it with Apple's own forthcoming file-syncing service.
Jobs declared Dropbox to be a "feature, not a product." Or, put another way, Jobs believed Dropbox didn't have a future as a standalone company. Houston said no thanks.
Since then, Houston and his team have been trying to prove Jobs wrong.
They've added more than a dozen features, including specialized photo storage and document editing. They've made it so apps can connect with Dropbox to store and sync files across devices. And they've worked to become even more attractive to businesses by making it easier for teams of people to share files.
So far, Dropbox has convinced more than 500 million people and 200,000 businesses to sign up. The question is, how many people are paying for its service? A privately held company, Dropbox won't say how many people pay. And unless it tells us, it's nearly impossible to know.
Dropbox, like most web companies, gives away a limited free version of its service when you just sign up. Over time, the company hopes you'll come to rely on its offerings, at which point you may decide to pay more (starting at $10 per month for individuals and $25 per person per month for teams) to store additional files.
Even so, all those people using Dropbox helped turn it into one of the first and largest Silicon Valley unicorns, or companies valued at more than $1 billion -- on paper, at least. For Dropbox, that happened in 2011, when investors valued it at $4 billion, according to CrunchBase.
Dropbox seemed on its way to becoming one of the great tech success stories, complete with a future that included a high-profile initial public offering beneath the ringing bell of Wall Street.
"They had the market cornered," said Brian Blau, an analyst at Gartner.
But it hasn't happened. All those years after meeting Jobs, Dropbox is still a private company. Its value, which zoomed up to $10 billion in 2014, hasn't changed. Bloomberg reported in August that Dropbox's financials may not justify that value when the company eventually begins selling public shares, something that could happen in the not-too-distant future. According to Bloomberg, Houston was preparing to file paperwork to begin that process.
Dropbox said in January that it's on track to tally $1 billion in sales this year, more than the nearly $400 million its already-public competitor Box tallied last year.
Houston, now 34, hopes that data point, among others, will make Dropbox a compelling buy for Wall Street. "Warren Buffett better be able to look at our business and say, 'This lemonade stand makes money,'" Houston told Bloomberg.
As for getting you and me to use Dropbox and pay for it? Houston has a plan for that, sort of. After years of working to come up with new and innovative ideas, Dropbox is now trying something else: an artsy rebranding campaign.
Starting Tuesday the San Francisco company freshened its look with new colors, different fonts and a flattened version of its storage box-like logo. Ultimately, the company is hoping to help remind people there's more to it than the free syncing service they signed up for and maybe rely on for work. It's also to remind them that Dropbox is more than just an always-there "feature," as Jobs put it so dismissively.
Dropbox now wants to be known as a place for creativity as well. Whether it will or not remains to be seen.
Drew Houston in 2015.
The reasons why Dropbox's efforts have only whelmed us so far are hard to pinpoint. One answer may be that Houston and co-founder Arash Ferdowsi caught lightning in a bottle with their original file-syncing service. The result is that stuff they've done to expand beyond the core Dropbox service since seems just OK by comparison.
Meanwhile, companies including Google, Apple and Amazon are treading on Dropbox's turf, offering file-syncing services of their own. Google has Google Drive, Apple has iCloud, Microsoft has OneDrive and Amazon has Amazon Drive. "The strategy today is for tech companies to be strategically diverse," Blau said. It's "been kind of a one-product company."
Dropbox declined to make executives available for comment.
Bring up Dropbox in Silicon Valley and you'll hear that almost everyone has used it. But the next thing tech followers -- and rivals -- will call out is that Steve Jobs quote. I asked Aaron Levie, CEO of business-focused rival Box, what he thought about it.
"Steve was 100 percent right when referring to the idea of accessing files on multiple devices," says Levie.
What's kept these companies from being eaten up by larger competitors has been their ability to offer better features, like increased security, while providing an easy-as-pie service.
"To Dropbox's credit on the consumer side, what they've done really well is great product execution," Levie acknowledges.
That excellent experience is what helped Dropbox make a splash when it was announced. 
Back then, there were other apps out there including SugarSync and Box (which started two years before Dropbox). But Houston sold Dropbox as a simple way to access your files from whatever computer you were working on.
"It just works," he said in a YouTube video introducing the service. In the video tour lasting less than five minutes, he showed how, after installing his app, any file placed in a folder called "My Dropbox" on one computer could be quickly synchronized over the internet with the same folder on another computer.
"They've come up with an online storage product that I might actually use regularly," TechCrunch said at the time. Ars Technica declared, "Dropbox ended my search for seamless sync." Michael Lopp, a popular webcomic author and software development blogger, asked "Is it magic?" (Yes, he concluded.)
I started using Dropbox as soon as I heard it was available. Over the years, it's served as the lifeboat Houston was thinking of when he came up with the idea after forgetting a thumb-drive filled with important files while on a trip.
I've used it to ferry files back and forth from work, to share pictures with friends, and to synchronize edits for my Status Update podcast about how tech is changing how new parents think about raising our kids.
Silicon Valley's money makers were quick to see its potential. Just two months after Dropbox launched its service, it got a stamp of approval from one of tech's best-known venture firms, Sequoia Capital, which led an early investment round of $6 million in November 2008.
A year later, Houston, known for his calm and quiet demeanor, was invited to Apple's headquarters for that meeting with Jobs -- where he turned down an acquisition offer (for an undisclosed amount) from one of the industry's most revered leaders.
For the next few years, Houston and his team tried to turn Dropbox into something more. People in Houston's orbit at the time said he was determined to create features that would attract even more people, even as Microsoft and Google began nipping at his company's heels.
Mailbox's innovative swiping feature made it an instant hit among the technorati.
For three years starting in 2012, Dropbox bought or released products that were tangentially connected to its syncing service. First, it began offering to automatically backup photos and videos from tablets, camera cards and phones for free. Then, it spent a rumored $100 million to buy a popular email program for phones called Mailbox, further pushing itself into the consumer tech world.
In 2014, its photo storage service morphed into a free new offering called Carousel, which synchronized photos and videos from tablets, camera storage cards and phones.
But by 2015, Dropbox was throwing in the towel on both Carousel and Mailbox. By way of explanation for ditching them, Houston wrote in a blog post at the time that "over the past few months, we've increased our team's focus on collaboration and simplifying the way people work together." Translation: It's no longer worth the investment, and we're going to focus on more lucrative business customers and other projects.
While many things likely led to these projects' demise, some people who worked with Houston say one of the problems was his personality.
But it's hard to get a bead on just how Houston operates. One former employee says the CEO, who cofounded the company in 2007 with fellow MIT student Ferdowsi, often asked for feedback. But others described him as sticking to his guns rather than considering various points of view -- a trait you'd expect to see at times from a headstrong entrepreneurial founder. One of his favorite books is, "Only the Paranoid Survive," by Andy Grove, who co-founded the chipmaking giant Intel.
Compare that to someone like Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg. Though he's often portrayed as robotic and emotionally withdrawn, people who've worked for him say his success comes in part from changing his mind after input and debate. (To be sure, Zuckerberg has also chased techno-dead ends, including projects like building a Facebook phone and using unpolished web technologies to build early versions of his mobile app, which made it slow and buggy for years.)
While Dropbox toiled on photos and email, larger competitors were muscling into the syncing game. One of the biggest is Apple, which revamped its iCloud file sync and storage service just before Jobs died in 2011. Google debuted its free Google Drive file service in 2012, complete with a Dropbox-like file sync app for your phone or computer. And there's Microsoft, whose OneDrive is now built into its Windows software that powers hundreds of millions of PCs; Amazon, which offers file storage through its $99 per year Prime subscription; and business-oriented Box, which has focused on features like security.
That's led to an interesting problem. All these companies offer a small amount of storage for free, to get people hooked, just like Dropbox. And while businesses like travel site Expedia, the Sundance Institute and ice cream maker Ben & Jerry's, use Dropbox in their offices, TECHnalysis Research founder Bob O'Donnell said many people switch between the free versions of different services to avoid paying for any of them.
That includes O'Donnell himself, who uses Dropbox to shuttle around files too large to send in an email, but doesn't pay the company a dime.
"That's pretty much what I use it for," he said.
One of Dropbox's artsy marketing animations for Paper, before Tuesday's new campaign.
Ahead of Dropbox's new marketing efforts Tuesday, it published a couple ads on Facebook to drum up attention. But, like many of Dropbox's non-sync efforts, the ads didn't entirely make sense.
The marketing push was for a product called Paper, which was released in 2015. It's designed to help you easily create and share documents and ideas. If that sounds familiar, it's probably because Google Docs, one of its many competitors, had been available for a decade at that point, doing a similar thing. There's also Google Keep, Microsoft OneNote, Evernote and Box Notes.
"We have a single-minded focus, and that is to simplify the way people work with collaboration," said Tony Ward, Dropbox's manager for Australia and New Zealand, in an interview with The Australian Financial Review Monday.
One of the ads uploaded last month was a series of blue-shaded fractals moving in space. Another was a looping video of a man playing a standing drum set. Both had the tagline, "Dropbox Paper. A new type of doc designed for ideas of all kinds. #CreateTogether."
If that seems a little fuzzy, you're not the only one who thinks so.
"Their ads make no sense. I have no idea what it is," wrote one Facebook user identifying herself as Jennifer Jean, who was among the nearly 900,000 people who saw either ad. "I don't get this," wrote another user, Jonny Sayeth. "So… its [sic] just Google docs?"
Dropbox is hoping its new branding efforts will underscore the idea of people working together. One way is through bringing together colors that seem like they clash, such as violet and mint.
"The overarching [idea of this brand] is by bringing two unexpected things together, and you get an interesting, extraordinary thing together," Dropbox Creative Director Aaron Robbs told Fast Company. "When you get two people working together ... how does that play in the [brand] system?"
I don't really get it either.
Still, the company released a new modern-art-inspired marketing video, asking questions like "What does #CreativeEnergy mean?"
Hopefully for Dropbox, we'll find out soon.

With technology increasingly intertwined with all aspects of business, CNET@Work can help you -- from prosumers to small businesses with fewer than five employees -- get started.
When Saks Fifth Avenue agreed to stock coats and blazers made by startup Norwegian Wool, founder Michael Berkowitz needed to create a booklet to educate the big retailer's salespeople about the new line.
"Saks gets in brands all the time and so you need to set yourself apart," said Berkowitz, who left a career on Wall Street to start his New York-based company in 2014. "We wanted this to be good."
But Norwegian Wool didn't have that kind of in-house talent, so Berkowitz decided to outsource the work to a freelance designer based overseas.
"You can find really good design work using contractors," said Berkowitz, who was pleased with the results. "There are lots of them out there who just prefer to work as freelancers."
And there are a lot of businesses interested in going that route.
One recent study found that about one-third of US companies last year used freelancers while more than half intend to hire additional freelancers in 2017. In the much-chronicled era of the gig economy, it's now relatively easy to find people willing to work on a short-term basis.
Contract work also offers the chance to size up potential team members before making any longer-term financial commitments.
"We often start people out as contractors and work with them for a year or so to get a feel for whether or not they are a good fit for employment," noted Tim Hamilton founder and CEO of Praxent, a software and web development firm in Austin, Texas.
Anna Brockway, co-founder and CMO of Chairish.
It also helps avoid hiring mistakes.
"I've found that no matter how good of a recruiter you are, you are going to make some hiring mistakes," said Anna Brockway, the co-founder and CMO of Chairish, a San Francisco-based online curated marketplace for vintage furniture and décor. "Maybe the person oversold their skills, or perhaps they are simply not a cultural fit. Working with potential new hires on a short-term, independent contractor project first can be a great way to validate your hiring assumptions."
At the same time, the organization is not on the hook for paying out health benefits, payroll taxes, severance packages or unemployment insurance to contractors.
But if your company is growing to the point where it needs freelance help, be aware of the potential pitfalls. Consider the experience of Max Agrad, who started Voxel Worlds, a developer of virtual reality mobile applications for the real estate industry.
Agrad relied initially on contractors but came to regret the decision after encountering some who overstated their qualifications or turned out to be frauds. He recalled emailing with a mobile developer in Singapore, asking the candidate to share samples of his virtual reality work. Instead, the developer sent back a video where he was filmed using an app that was made by another company.
A worker cannot be both an employee and an independent contractor at the same company. They are one or the other; they cannot be both. Unfortunately, there is no single test for determining whether a person actually is an employee or independent contractor. For instance, the IRS uses a 20-factor test for determining worker status, including things like the amount of training and instructions someone receives, the number of set hours of work and where the work takes place. Even then, the line sometimes gets blurred. In fact, the US Labor Department has estimated that up to 30 percent of companies misclassify their employees. In certain cases, that's due to honest mistakes and confusion about the law; in others, business owners are trying to evade regulations such as the minimum wage or the payment of unemployment insurance taxes for full-time employees. But it's not worth trying to get cute with the IRS by classifying certain employees as contractors. You may be trying to save a few dollars but you risk opening a Pandora's box of trouble with the government. 
Obviously, the question of freelance versus full-time ultimately boils down to choices that vary by company and industry. At Cinch Financial, for example, the Boston-based software startup roughly doubled its headcount to 40 in the last year. Over that time, it applied different hiring strategies to fit its different business needs, according to Kerri Moriarty, who heads company development.
"For example, we generally seek to hire engineers as full-time employees," Moriarty said. "We know we have a long-term evolving need for those roles and it gives us a better return on investment to bring them on as full-time from the start. In other areas, we get more value from independent contractors, particularly for a short-term need."
But even in the absence of a one-size-fits-all approach, consider the following when it comes to rounding out your growing roster.
Take stock of your cash flow. Freelancers may be the best option for cash-conscious startups and small businesses during down periods in the business cycle when payroll may prove to be a burden. Even if a small company is growing rapidly, payroll remains a huge expense. Do the math to figure the likely return on investment by taking on more full-time employees. And before using any freelancers, make sure that their work is going to contribute to the bottom line.
How complex is the project? You can always find freelancers able to do simple tasks like designing marketing fliers. A cottage industry of companies such as Fiverr, Upwork, Guru and PeoplePerHour now exists that will connect companies with contractors. But keep in mind that more complex projects may involve extensive in-house training, which adds extra cost.
What's your timetable for completing the project? Businesses that tend to do a lot of one-offs may benefit by hiring contractors on a project-by-project basis.
Ask yourself whether there's a long-term benefit to developing this kind of talent in-house. If the work is not core to the business, farm it out to a professional with the experience to do the job. But if you need a software developer who can help roll out versions 1.0, 2.0 and 3.0 of the company's flagship product, that's someone you need to hire as a member of your team.
It takes time to integrate full-time employees into the organization and its culture. By contrast, a contractor is only responsible for the bottom-line results and ought to be sufficiently self-motivated to complete their assignments without any hand-holding. If you're not ready or willing to make a long-term commitment, contractors are the better bet.


Technically Incorrect offers a slightly twisted take on the tech that's taken over our lives.
Need anything from the store?
The most powerful tech companies have become utilities.
To many, Google is search. Just as Amazon is online shopping.
This seems to depress Google somewhat. How dare Amazon perform such a swift takeover of something Google would itself quite like to own? 
So here's a new campaign that -- only with slight subtlety -- tries to discourage you from shopping on Amazon.
Instead, use Google Express. The service features many famous brands and doesn't involve a $99 Amazon Prime-like membership. However, you'll have meet retailer minimums in order to get free shipping. 
The ad tries to be soft and human -- not always aspects associated with Amazon. Here, humans are asking other humans to order things for them. Because the asking humans are themselves far too busy. 
This goes on for almost a minute before the simple line "need anything from the store?" appears. And then the final promise: "All your stores in one place."
Which might, in some minds, incite the question: "Wait, isn't that what Amazon is anyway?" And with Amazon, you can bundle everything in one big Pantry box that arrives on your doorstep.
Amazon didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. 
It's fascinating, though, how Google is consistently trying to encroach upon spaces in which Amazon appears ahead. 
Tomorrow, Google is likely to launch new smart speakers, directly challenging Amazon's attempts to reach so far into your home that it can hear you pull the flush in the restroom.
Amazon hasn't take over too many homes yet, but it's desperately throwing as much at the effort as it can. While it can.
The problem is, as Google itself knows, that once people believe your brand is the natural one to go to, it's very difficult to shift behavior.

Amazon is lending a hand to residents of Puerto Rico following the devastating hurricane that hit the island almost two weeks ago.

The company sent a plane full of supplies, including baby formula, sheets, tents, tarps and other essential items, to San Juan on Monday, according to Instagram and Twitter posts from Jeff Bezos, founder and CEO of Amazon.  
Much of Puerto Rico has been without food, water and electricity since Hurricane Maria, a category 4 storm, hit on Sept. 20. Roads and buildings have been destroyed on the Caribbean island and communications networks are almost nonexistent. Local officials have complained that response efforts from the federal government have been slow.
Amazon isn't the only tech company to step up efforts to help victims. As soon as the storm passed, Tesla began sending hundreds of Powerwall battery systems, which are paired with solar panels to help restore electric power, according to news reports.  
Other technology companies donated money. For instance, Google has donated $1 million to Puerto Rico hurricane relief, which includes funds collected from Google employees. Combined with earlier donations, Google said the company, its workers and "the public" have given $7 million to aid in recovery from Harvey, Irma and Maria.
Phone and internet company Verizon has also committed to donating $1 million. Apple, Facebook and Uber have also donated to hurricane relief. Facebook has raised more than $10 million for victims of Harvey, Irma and Maria.
Tech companies have also rallied to help change policy and combat climate change, which scientists believe contributes to more powerful storms. In June, Apple, Facebook and Google as well as Tesla's Elon Musk unsuccessfully urged President Donald Trump not to back out of the Paris accord to fight global warming.

Satya Nadella at Vanity Fair's New Establishment Summit
In 2011, a cartoon zoomed around the internet depicting the organizational setups of various tech companies.
Amazon was a typical top-down setup, with someone in charge and people working for that person, then people working for them, etc. Apple, meanwhile, was depicted with everyone in a circle effectively all answering to the CEO.
Then there was Microsoft, where the cartoon depicted different teams, but each holding guns pointed at one another. For those who knew Microsoft's cutthroat culture, both internally and to the outside world, it rang very true.
When Satya Nadella was tapped to lead Microsoft in 2014, he decided the company needed a different approach.
"I said 'We need a learning culture,'" he told an audience Tuesday at Vanity Fair's New Establishment summit in Los Angeles. 
Since then, he's pushed Microsoft to be more collaborative with competitors. For example, one of his first decisions was to release Microsoft's Office productivity software for Apple's iPhones and iPads. He's elevated the role of consumer technology at Microsoft, both by expanding the company's line of Surface computers and by giving more prominence to the Xbox video game team. 
When Microsoft geared up to release Windows 10, the latest version of software that powers PCs, Nadella made it free for the first year. He's even said to be looking into a "major" expansion of Microsoft's presence in Silicon Valley. 
And there's Microsoft's old mission statement, "A PC on every desk and in every home" running Microsoft software. Now, it has a more modern twist: "To empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more." 
While Nadella didn't go into much detail during his panel discussion Tuesday, he did write a book about his efforts, called "Hit Refresh," where he talked about changing Microsoft's culture. 
Bottom line, he said Microsoft needs to be empathetic, even if it's actually a massive company that could take on pretty much anyone.
"Instead of viewing things as zero sum, it's how do we think of partnerships," he said.

Google's AlphaGo defeated Chinese Go player Ke Jie (left) this year to become the world champion.
Google's AlphaGo may have unseated Ke Jie as the Go world champion this year, but the artificial intelligence behind AlphaGo is actually no smarter than a 6-year-old child.
A study published Saturday showed Google's artificial intelligence technology scored best out of 50 systems that Chinese researchers tested against an AI scale they created, CNBC reported Monday. With a IQ score of 47.28, Google's AI was almost twice as smart as Apple virtual assistant Siri, which scored 23.94.
AI systems have developed so quickly that they've been able to act as assistants, take exams and even outperform us at strategy games. But the new results may downplay the concerns of people uneasy about AI's rapid progression.
To evaluate how smart an intelligent system is (or has become), its ability to "acquire, master, create and feedback knowledge" needs to be tested, wrote the researchers. In 2014, the IQ of 50 AI systems was rated. The systems included Google's AI, Siri and Chinese search engine Baidu. Three humans, ages 18, 12 and 6, were also rated. When the researchers tested the AI systems again in 2016, they found that Google was the smartest and improved the fastest (from an IQ of 26.5 to 47.28), but it wasn't enough to beat even a 6-year-old, who came in with a score of 55.5.
Notable "AI worriers" include physicist Stephen Hawking and Tesla Motors and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, who both won the 2015 Luddite Award and were branded AI "alarmists." Hawking is a firm believer that AI could pose a real danger depending on who controls it and argues that it could outsmart us and end humanity. Musk agrees there's significant risk and asked for regulation in July, going as far as to suggest AI could start World War III. Alibaba founder and executive chairman, Jack Ma, predicts that companies could be helmed by AI systems in the next three decades.
Dr Lin Hsuan-Tien, chief data scientist of Taiwan-based AI startup, Appier, agrees AI systems have yet to reach the intelligence of even a six-year-old, but possess extraordinary learning capabilities.
"Scientists believed AI was capable of lots of things but were disappointed by failures created out of unrealistic goals," Dr Lin tells CNET in an email. 
"Many AI researchers instead started to focus on 'weak AI,' which [tackles] specific problems, such as image recognition or playing the game of Go. Weak AI has proven that its ability to learn surpasses the capabilities of most human beings and is able to achieve super-human performance levels." 
Google declined to comment.

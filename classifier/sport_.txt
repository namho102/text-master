There ways measuring competitiveness sport people. The effective getting play sport vocation. For England cricketer Jenny Gunn, sport football. She played Notts County called England trials, cricket fork age 17. She ambitions play Sunday league calls time career that, far, given 13 years international level. When Mark Robinson took England head coach end 2015, reinstated football warm-ups. The squad, multi-sported, thrilled. Not Gunn. Oh, ridiculous, shouts. There tackling rule. How supposed ball? You end backing allowing time space. You know  I'd play. My dad taught me: You hard home.' That coach taught him. Go tackle like meant it.

At really gets you, freely concedes. I mean, I could change. But tested I know I near. The footage bowling super slow-mo, makes sick I arm back. It does bother now, crowd shout no ball'. Sarah Taylor calls Chucky. Danielle Hazell wearing long sleeves, saying: All chuckers wear them.' Gunn accepts hear summer opposition fans pundits alike.

Manchester United watching Cristiano Ronaldo renewed Real Madrid striker plain outraged feels unfair treatment tax authorities determined leave Spain. The 32-year-old feels singled disproportionate treatment prosecutors accused defrauding authorities 14.7m. A source close player claims outraged Portugal international feels great indignation following public speculation tax affairs sense injustice allegations  contests  decision leave country. Ronaldo, signed new five-year contract November, secret affection United  club left join Madrid 2009 years Old Trafford  Jos Mourinho, shares super agent Jorge Mendes, relish return seeks build team capable title challenge successful campaign Champions League. United remain clubs financial muscle offer competitive package Ronaldo  predicting record revenues 570m year  return dream commercial move. He 1bn (880m) release clause current Madrid deal United  Zlatan Ibrahimovic wages books potential lose Wayne Rooney financial burden soon  able meet Ronaldo wage demands 400,000 week. Paris Saint-Germain match United offer Old Trafford presents Ronaldo fairytale moment far grander stage perform. The potential availability world marketable players naturally alert Chinese Super League clubs. Reports Ronaldo wanted leave Real sparked Friday Portuguese newspaper A Bola. It claimed decision irreversible told Madrid team-mates wants leave. The root Ronaldo anger stems Spanish prosecutors' lawsuit player, accusing defrauding tax authorities 14.7m hiding image rights income 2011 2014. Ronaldo categorically denied wrongdoing. Real backed assertion, saying confident Portuguese forward acted legally. Following tax allegations, Ronaldo posted picture himself fingers lips Instagram caption: Sometimes best answer it quiet. Earlier week Ronaldo agency Gestifute released statement read: There tax evasion scheme ... There hiding intention hide anything. Ronaldo frustrations treatment come leading Real Champions League titles, scoring twice month final Juventus Cardiff club retain trophy. He second player score different finals remains competition record goalscorer 105. Barcelona Lionel Messi took similar stance threatening quit Spain 2014, claiming singled special treatment, accused concealing 4.1m authorities. The Argentina international guilty subsequently lost appeal 21-month prison sentence  Spanish law sentences years usually suspended  2.1m (1.8m) fine. The tragic scenario attached Augusta National founding fathers, Clifford Roberts, known similarly grim circumstances form backdrop Erin Hills barely featured buildup US Open. For obvious reasons, perhaps; tale money problems, homicide lengthy jail term hardly keeping upbeat major championship narrative. Imagery Roberts remains constant feature Masters week. In September 1977, aged 83 year standing long-term Augusta chairman, committed suicide premises played major establishing. The scenario Steve Trattner troublesome involves criminality. As Erin Hills stages major week, Trattner watched television nearby jail. He serving 35-year sentence murder wife. And, make mistake, Waupun Correctional Institution, Trattner observing shot. I going watching minute tournament, said recent interview Sports Illustrated. For years, place home away home. Trattner, software engineer, clearly architect eye. While living seemingly unremarkable life outskirts Milwaukee, married soon father two, dream build public golf course. Such concept fanciful identifying appropriate land; itself infamously tricky business. But Trattner it, just convinced multi-millionaire Bob Lang fund project. Only people, Bob Lang I, experienced day-to-day transformation property, explained Trattner. All ups downs, challenges, hundreds conversations tweaks. The $2.5m land deal pieced 1999 minute, farmer owned known Erin Hills verge removing land market. Trattner project manager salary $2,000 month. I free, claimed. He fulfilling long-term dream. By 2005, year facility opened, Trattner concerned Lang increased spending golf course. The former marriage Sin Lam trouble owing, mainly, Trattner addiction-like approach Erin Hills. I going general manager heaven me, later said. The upshot instead altogether different. After domestic dispute 3 January 2006  Lam intending filing divorce  court papers reveal Trattner threw wife cabinet, banged head floor performed strangulation. He covered wife blanket, dragged living room went bed taking children school following morning normal. That afternoon  meetings Erin Hills  Trattner called police, sleeping pills having placed Lam imply suicide. Trattner went plead guilty first-degree reckless homicide. He currently midst appeal, basis properly advised represented courtroom hearings. Trattner claims self defence key actions. If you judge, sitting guy sitting you, wife supposedly strangled death reason, you going care golf course knows about, admits Lew Wasserman, Trattner lawyer. Is case perfect self-defence? Maybe not. But that issue. We dealing jury verdict. We dealing properly advised enter plea first-degree reckless homicide. It sadly ironic Steven Trattner efforts, would Erin Hills. Having smitten dream healthy, Lang himself fiscal hole. Spending spiralled control. The businessman, attended week tournament, sold site 2009, US Open dream reality. I come-to-Jesus myself, said. I choice. I sell. The price listed $10m, half Lang reckons spent. On Wednesday, United States Golf Association hosted annual pre-event media conference. The golf course championship venue make history, said USGA president, Diana Murphy. And want say thank owner Andy Ziegler congratulations. Ziegler stood up, waved took recognition floor. During correspondence Sports Illustrated writers, Trattner expresses regret Lang financial blow. At times I definitely wish I would pursued started Erin Hills, said. I ca help feel guilty awful devastated Bob family. It US Open storyline feature guidebooks. That does prevent fascinating horribly sad; golfer falling agonisingly short major key component tragedy. Mike Tyson interesting new book called Iron Ambition. In talks violent childhood, explores relationship late coach, great Cus D'Amato, kicks thing passage wandering old Brooklyn neighbourhood, marvelling gentrification, tourists and, all, sight people taking selfies place. Like grouchy middle-aged men Mike has, sense, fully engaged selfie craze. Imagine trying people I hanging Times Square, writes. Hey man, let selfie!' Motherfuckers start beating leave coma street. We back, course. But ways, happier, wiser times. This not, yet, famous Tyson quote. That comes instead time rampaging heavyweight division asked room journalists opponent plans dance inside, hit run generally pick off. Everyone plan, came reply. Until punched mouth. It cool quote, albeit little misunderstood, assumption did Tyson prime saying marks force untutored aggression, front-foot brutality. Read book realise phrase strong echoes D'Amato, brilliant strategist talked getting hit, triumph turn Tyson counterpunching technician, saving ferocious attacks he'd just slipped best shot. What Mike Cus saying was: plan better. Just trainers football managers work relentlessly defence, flaws opponents' attack disrupting what coming them. Can feel yet? Can feel Jos Mourinho hard, flat, insolent gaze glaring words? This week fascinating set quotes doing rounds, time Mourinho, extracted remarks Lisbon university preparations Europa League final Ajax. These picked newspaper Tribuna Expresso translated football analyst Tiago Estvo. Again talk strategy and, all, getting retaliation first. The striking thing level Mourinho prep Ajax, way really does visualise game advance, reaching horrible hands opponent rib cage gouging nails vital organs. The second striking thing response social media insight, reflecting certain acerbic reaction Mourinho season Manchester United, tendency hold perfumed handkerchief nose, splutter anti-football, suggest setting team defensively way cynical disrespectful. And this, idea club like United instead imposing freewheeling, tousle-haired will, leaving washing-up, romping like cosseted puppies rest. This feels bit baffling neutral. Looking Mourinho notes hard complete respect opponent sport. He mucking here. Mourinho watched Ajax matches Stockholm. He clear plan, set counter measures worked 10 minutes gone telling Rui Faria we pockets. The stage create instability hustling Matthijs Ligt, Ajax usual conduit back, forcing Davinson Snchez ball forward instead. Snchez hugely talented shut Marcus Rashford night he good ball partner. So strength weakness. Carrying ball forward, Snchez looked stage two: United matched Ajax midfield man man, leaving real option pass long. Which did. By end Snchez 35 passes De Ligt, including long balls, Ajax machine slightly jiggered place. Everybody plan  hustled series unplanned movements master pre-emptive smothering tweak. Mourinho defence strict orders. Chris Smalling,  let face  times look like he playing pair oversized square-toed cow-poke boots, told pass long time, make attempt link midfield, negating Ajax powerful high press. They followed drill. United played 25 long balls. Smalling Daley Blind did pass Paul Pogba. A team stars man-marked 17-year-old novice defender. And United won European final guarded canter horribly subversive pragmatism giving ball 90m record signing. For beautiful giving opponents want, Mourinho sneered Lisbon. I was but, let face it, sneered it, maybe cackled it. And he right. This way deeply beautiful. So snorts unhappiness? Clearly defensive football is everyone idea fun. It does look good telly. Pogba willingness fit plan admirable extreme talents airing elsewhere. Similarly Mourinho love system, ability wrench opponent circuit boards, seen greatest triumphs arrive clubs just tier, turning B-list European power snarling, spitting, brilliantly obstructive champion. Beyond hard avoid idea people make mistake conflating Mourinho tactics toxic infuriating public persona: sneakiness, tedious jibes, sight stalking touchline haggardly baggy grey shell suit trousers look man dragged static caravan wee hours forced walk miles hard shoulder search canister butane gas, he forgotten wallet, lost flip-flops gorse bush taunted busload primary school children. For that, notion beneath Manchester United bit odd. The later Sir Alex Ferguson teams hardly buccaneering free spirits swinging hip. Chewing manager years, United won Cups. This feels like progress, ice pick lodged cliff face. Mourinho counterpuncher. He Floyd Mayweather Roberto Durn. But nation academic, systems-based approach jeeringly dismissed, obsession team, winning preventing defeat, kind refined mathematics, kind poetry. Aidy Boothroyd admitted England Under-21 rescued disastrous defeat opening match European Championship super goalkeeper Jordan Pickford new 30m Everton signing penalty save minutes time secured point holders, Sweden. Ben Chilwell reckless challenge Linus Wahlqvist looked like condemning England defeat left hopes reaching semi-finals hanging thread, Pickford deny player spot excellent right-hand save. It ensured England second match Slovakia Monday knowing play for, Boothroyd acknowledged need improve drastically end desperate record failing group tournaments. It fair result end certainly play better did, said. Sweden gave problems dealt with. It disappointing concede penalty  I sure  given, was. Of course super goalkeeper keeps penalties out. Pickford, expensive goalkeeper history Thursday, little half England decent start Sweden gradually imposed match gone ahead Pawel Cibicki curling effort just outside box cannoned crossbar. Chilwell struck woodwork long range heavily deflected effort soon little complaint penalty award diving appeared little danger. Wahlqvist penalty poorly struck Pickford, initial stop, hand save substitute Carlos Strandberg weak follow-up enable England hang draw. I waited longer held ground got penalty; that do, goalkeeper said. Sweden killed tempo bit, game plan let ball Monday. The main thing lose game. The game tight came away draw. It win two. That easy task despite Slovakia Poland poor records tournament, Group A winners guaranteed place newly expanded format 12 teams. Watched senior team manager, Gareth Southgate, Football Association chairman, Greg Clarke, England came game unwanted record having conceded goals finals nation. More 5,000 Sweden supporters atmosphere Kielce feel like Stockholm southern Poland, England game win. Tammy Abraham unlucky acrobatic effort just half-time miss target excellent flick-on Alfie Mawson following throw-in. Boothroyd strong start break hampered disappointing end product flanks, Everton right-back Mason Holgate culpable times. Lewis Baker struggled make impact No10 role Nathaniel Chalobah captain, James Ward-Prowse, frequently overrun midfield inevitable Sweden secure victory poured forward clock ticked down. Strandberg particularly dangerous break last-ditch challenge Holgate prevented having one-on-one Pickford just penalty conceded. Boothroyd philosophical side chances progressing but, having seen Pickford complete Goodison Park away international duty, admitted admiration way 23-year-old handled pressure. He quite week, said. Most people struggle deal what happened sort dip but, touch wood, does. I thought excellent. We want qualify semi-finals order win games it really important did lose, added Boothroyd. We look say it defining moment, I hope. It important do play dig make sure do beaten. I satisfied I want win game but, level, realistic ca win single game. What important focused do beaten make sure qualify. The card game bridge hardly physically strenuous activities. But according judgment European court justice senior lawyers, game considered sport  tax purposes least. The recommendation latest salvo longrunning legal case brought English Bridge Union (EBU), argues entry fees tournaments exempt VAT, case activities classed sport. The EBU lost initial claim HM Revenue Customs, says sports significant element physical activity. But EBU appealed upper tax tribunal, referred case European judges. The player-funded organisation maintains preferential tax treatment sport intended benefit activities provide physical mental health benefits regular participants. It argues bridge  game played players competing partnerships  helps stimulate mind, particularly older people. On Thursday advocate general Maciej Szpunar argued sport understood involved training mental physical fitness way generally beneficial health wellbeing citizens, recommended bridge exempted VAT UK. He noted International Olympic Committee organisations expressly include mental sports endorse activities physical element, having classified bridge sport 1998. The case reviewed ECJ judgesin autumn. If uphold Szpunar recommendation, EBU longer pay VAT eligible rebate. While recommendation binding, judges usually follow advice advocate generals. This huge benefits allow invest game, make entries EBU competitions cheaper, allowing people enjoy playing bridge, enabling experience social mental benefits playing bridge offers, EBU said statement. Jeremy Dhondy, EBU chairman, said finding a vindication view bridge regarded sport advantages brings bridge game members prospective members. We want game play activity promote social inclusion welcome judgment European court, added. Different countries different opinions bridge sport. In Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France classed sport tax purposes, Ireland Sweden not. The 2011 Charities Act adopted definition sport activities promote health involving physical mental health exertion, specifically included mind sports. However, 2015 high court ruled bridge sport eligible lottery funding, lawyers acting Sport England telling court game sport sitting home reading book.

Adjustment opponent quality important because, use just raw results, 90-point thrashing struggling team treated differently assessment team ability similar result talented opponent. This notion continuously rating individuals teams using results adjusted opposition quality long history. One version method traced Arpad Elo, came way rating chess players defeated, drew lost players widely differing abilities. It used purpose today. In sports like football, Elo-style rating systems expanded provide just single rating team, separate rating offensive defensive abilities; based team record scoring points relative quality defences faced, record preventing points scored relative quality offences faced. If AFL quantify offensive defensive abilities teams seasons using common currency: points. There ways this, number websites offer versions, methodology we use following key characteristics: Applying methodology generates data chart below, records offensive defensive ratings team seasons 2000 2016 end respective home-and-away seasons. Teams ultimately won flag signified dots coloured red, finished runner-up dots coloured orange. The grey dots teams season  missed grand final. We teams lie bottom-left top-right quadrants, tells teams modern era above-average offensively tended above-average defensively, conversely below-average offensive teams tended below-average defensively well. The level association teams' offensive defensive ratings measured using called correlation coefficient, takes values -1 +1. Negative values imply negative association  say strong offensive teams tended weak defensively vice versa  positive values imply positive association, chart. From correlation coefficients team ratings current previous eras degree association team offensive defensive ratings historically high levels modern era. In fact, it high earliest days VFL. In words, teams' offensive defensive ratings tended similar different modern era. By way comparison, here picture 1980 1999 era weaker relationship teams' offensive defensive ratings apparent. Note increase correlation teams' offensive defensive abilities modern era come reduction spread team abilities. If ignore teams lowest highest 5% offensive defensive abilities, range offensive ratings modern era span 31 points defensive ratings span 34 points. For 1980-1999 era equivalent ranges points larger. One plausible hypothesis cause closer association offensive defensive abilities modern teams coaching training methods improved served reduce level independent variability skill sets. The charts eras thing common, however: congregation grand finalists  orange red dots  north-eastern corner. This expect quadrant teams above-average offensively defensively. Only handful grand finalists era finished home-and-away season below-average offensive defensive ratings. In modern era, just teams gone finals below-average defensive ratings  Melbourne 2000 Port Adelaide 2007, finished runners-up respective seasons. Melbourne finished home-and-away season conceding 100 points games, conceding 98 99 points others. Those results took collective toll defensive rating. Port Adelaide ended 2007 home-and-away season positively probably team second ladder expected  assessment reasonable given grand final result just weeks later. In 2007 grand final, Geelong defeated 119 points. The chart modern era highlights highly-rated teams consider unlucky grand final years  2016 Adelaide St Kilda teams particular, Saints' rating somewhat elevated 139-point thrashing Lions final home-and-away game season. Based relatively small sample successful teams shown chart, it difficult come firm conclusions relative importance offensive versus defensive ability making grand finals winning flags, impossible say relative importance getting team finals place. To look issue use ratings slightly different way. Specifically, use calculate winning rates teams classified basis offensive defensive superiority inferiority time clash. Those calculations summarised table below, groups games eras iron season-to-season fluctuations make underlying differences apparent. The percentages interesting column furthest left block. They tell successful teams stronger defensively weaker offensively opponents been. What that, era second world war: We note percentages statistically significantly different 50%, ca definitively claim that, particular era, defensive superiority preferable offensive superiority home-and-away season opposite true finals. That clear tendency, evidence statistically weak, differences random noise. In case, effect sizes quite small  1% 2% points  practically makes sense conclude offensive defensive abilities historically roughly equal importance team success home-and-away games finals. So, current crop teams sit? The chart maps 18 current teams' ratings end round 12 ratings 34 grand finalists period 2000-2016 end round 12 respective years. Adelaide stand offensively, rating good 2000 Essendon team 12-0 round 12 having averaged just 136 points game season all-team average score 103 points team game entire home-and-away season. The Dons scored rate just 30% higher average team. This year, Adelaide averaging just 119 points game season all-team average just 91 points game, 30% higher. They are, clearly, formidable team offensively, they impress consistently defensively. The 2017 Port Adelaide GWS teams come next, located just outside crop highest-rated grand finalists, having combined ratings little Adelaide. This week loss Essendon (quite reasonably) significant effect Port rating, GWS loss Carlton. Geelong, Collingwood, Sydney, Richmond Western Bulldogs little south-east prime flag-winner territory, require above-expectation performances upcoming weeks enter area. The Bulldogs particular need little offensive ability push group, similar rating point season, who say need more. Collingwood relatively high rating raise eyebrows, have, noted, generated scoring shots losses Western Bulldogs round Essendon round five, generated fewer scoring shots losses Richmond round two, St Kilda round four, Carlton round seven, GWS round eight, Melbourne round 12. They currently ranked seventh combined rating. Essendon, Melbourne St Kilda form sub-group  rated slightly average combined rating previous grand finalists equivalent point season. No team combined rating positive exceeds flag winner point season 2000. As such, remaining seven teams make history win flag. Still, there lot happen end season, final chart, shows 2017 team ratings ratings non-grand finalists seasons 2000 2016. There plenty sides chart rated highly end round 12 got far grand final day. For example, Geelong 2010 team 10-2 12 rounds, game clear head competition ladder 156 percentage. That team went 7-3 remainder home-and-away season finish runners-up minor premiership eliminated minor premiers, Collingwood, 120-79 preliminary final. And, case, year results constantly surprised wins currently separates fith 17th ladder, team reasonably feel assured progressing September, let MCG end month. Even best-laid plans instantly scuppered British & Irish Lions suddenly red alert fitness Owen Farrell. A thigh strain sustained training ruled fly-half match-day squad face Maori All Blacks Saturday time Test All Blacks week later. Farrell reported grade quadricep tear, lesser end scale thing Lions need kicker playmaker bad leg. For attention given Peter O'Mahony selection captain Maori, names uppermost Gatland mind currently Farrell tour captain, Sam Warburton. If start Test reasons injury form respectively, Lions' stock on-field leaders conspicuously depleted. As official indication Farrell fit again, Dan Biggar coming Saturday bench, pressure rests Jonathan Sexton, best chance starting Tests No10 previously rested Farrell playing 12. Barring swift recovery Saracen, weekend midfield combination Sexton, Ben Te'o Jonathan Davies standby feature New Zealand well. Gatland, suspects, planning Farrell, Te'o Davies forming 10-12-13 partnership Auckland hoping late rush form Warburton secure place ahead O'Mahony Sean O'Brien. The Irishmen Taulupe Faletau impressive back-row combination, however, Saturday win Crusaders Warburton Test arriving days soon. Gatland, admission, currently tempted leave trio intact. With O'Mahony set remain on-field captain Warburton comes on, ground certainly prepared Test skipper tour leader separate individuals. He [Warburton] aware competition moment, confirmed Gatland. He fully understands loose forward trio went outstandingly Crusaders. But reasons selected captain squad tour is Sam Warburton, it putting squad first. So he involved Test performance Saturday night, fully understand that. Little room misinterpretation there. Similarly, Farrell fitness issues emerged, Gatland mince words Sexton: I think Johnny needs rugby. I thought really good coming bench day Johnny knows games were best games rugby. He little bit confidence but, moment, he got bit mojo back. In breath, so, head coach left door ajar second-half renewal 10-12 axis went Christchurch Davies departed early head knock. That combination pretty seamless, agreed Gatland, emphasising need different variations sleeve. We got make sure we fully showing hand. We got combinations All Blacks guessing little final squad be. The way things going necessary. Gatland opposite number, Steve Hansen, certainly expect trotting Eden Park. Anthony Watson, now, appears jumped ahead Liam Williams wing No15 jersey looks Leigh Halfpenny lose. Te'o everyone Test inside-centre tour looked comfortable date Robbie Henshaw. Maro Itoje invited prove offer Alun Wyn Jones; Gatland inclined revert Welshman alongside George Kruis starting Test lock combination change Itoje stormer. Rhys Webb Dan Cole, assuming fitness, contenders replace Greig Laidlaw Kyle Sinckler bench, proving squad engaging, enthusiastic members. If Ken Owens Jack McGrath leapfrog Jamie George Mako Vunipola respectively, meanwhile, going buck evidence tour far. On beautiful sunny day Lake Rotorua, Vunipola prominent list suspects backs finished session discover mischievous forwards tied training shoe laces removed completely. Smiles soon wiped faces, though, NZ Maori squad unveiled couple hours later. With quicksilver Chief Damian McKenzie fly-half, Nehe Milner-Skudder equally elusive Rieko Ioane wings dangerous James Lowe full-back, Lions breathless afternoon allow opponents time space.

Southgate frustrated 2-2 draw Scotland Hampden Park Saturday defeat Paris represents biggest disappointment new era, noted team old flaws Raphal Varane sent off. England, said, anxious soon extra man. I bitterly disappointed 2-2, 10, draw, Southgate said. But I shocked. I saw France lot summer [during Euro 2016]. I know power athleticism speed. I know team hard work lies ahead try bridge gap teams we played. The way understand gap playing teams. If we'd played lesser teams won maybe getting excited thinking better actually are. The reality exactly best. We matches away home long periods we acquitted well. But bit I think it important, group players group staff, recognise that. He added: If we'd lost lesser teams bigger concern. I know improving I know players receptive I know that going happen space months. I got forefront mind. I want players feel disappointed recognise moments opportunity really good result. Southgate used Tuesday friendly experiment 3-4-3 bad night England does necessarily mean reverting orthodox four.

Michael Jordan Chicago Bulls  Kerr  claimed love key ingredient hoisting trophy. But Warriors went 16-1 postseason, beating Cleveland 129-120 Monday Game 5 NBA finals, unlike sports empire. They do motivate anger. They do belittle another. They win like are. They win culture, that makes hard beat. And long Kerr stays Golden State remain league best team. Warriors assistant coach Bruce Fraser, played college basketball Kerr Arizona, explained told year: Steve incredibly important keen handling situations he able wants players offending them, getting screaming match. Fraser added: Sometimes I thinking: He got jump guys, good'. And thing know comes says really positive honest heart articulate sudden turned problem good. The obvious reaction Durant signing Golden State summer jumping float parade. But Durant, contemplative soulful superstars, wanted bigger gaudy ring joined Warriors. He watched happiness played wanted it. The winning just followed. Few outside NBA understand Kerr matters Warriors. How they? With players like Durant, Steph Curry, Klay Thompson Draymond Green Golden State lose? The assumption coach championship. Did Luke Walton lead 39-4 start year Mike Brown 11-0 playoffs Kerr issues? But brilliant Walton Brown were, foundation allowed wins come Kerr. The aura team his.

That is say Brown ca Golden State championships. He excellent coach. But way is Kerr way. No one is. The Warriors culture like NBA. It amazing ease Durant slipped team just set record wins season. Kerr lucky superstars Durant Curry team themselves, coach gives joy. Without just team lot good players. If second midweek defeat tour brought Lions earth, equally need Warren Gatland panic. There positives 23-22 defeat Dunedin  outscored Highlanders tries  failings Blues returned. It breathless match, best far, Lions wanting final stages. Should Owen Farrell Greig Laidlaw kicked goal considering involvement? Should Elliot Daly allowed clock run lining long-range penalty? And Lions attempt drive late lineout?

I compete Parkruns, I compete 10ks  albeit field  I loss excitement ambition involved sport. People able separate enjoyment involved running movement undermined fragilities elsewhere. We do like fragilities, hit hard damaged us. But stopping people wanting sport. There sign year diminution gates stadiums. But wo reach tipping point? SC: We got quickly make sure do reach tipping point. Rio sporting event, particularly athletics, best event we had. We records before, countries competing countries winning medals before. Poor leadership does impact performance, athletes repeatedly punch fragilities we had. But clearly link evaporation trust parents want children sport watch it? SC: When I set path reform I groups absolutely list order protect preserve create confidence. The clean athletes  we cares athletes clean not, we knacker yard. The group parents. They huge impact sport kids up. We ca parents grandparents thinking: Hmm, maybe athletics is sport going risk age 16 17 you going unscrupulous coach chancer agent saying shortcut doing cleanly athletics career.' They groups reforms absolutely aimed at. In today fragmented world choices open young people, athletics sports country again? SC: I do know. If I honest maybe not. But great deal restore support trust sport. We innovative, braver creative formats. The thing I said I president think differently. The Australians did. They came forward Nitro. It going universal panacea. You elimination miles London summer Olympics 2020, clues there. There better athlete engagement, event just hours, stadium did look like car boot sale. You focusing event moment young people excited. In country hemorrhaging athletics support, stadiums. Are going point Nine O'Clock News breaks world record attempt 1981? Possibly not. But lot relevant exciting. We got brave it. Why has sport evolved? SC: The sport beltway. We spoken other. I won English Schools title 44 years ago format has changed. I pretty watching format period time. I ca think sport that remained inviolate change time. Twenty20 well, look Rugby Sevens. Look Formula-E. Even watching Chelsea day, I noticed player match selected fans. To say Usain Bolt, probably recognisable athlete planet, does 30 Snapchat Instagram pretty insightful. How cope Usain Bolt? SC: We need work harder make sure Wayde van Niekerks, David Rudishas Valerie Adamses given horsepower help void. But going void, doubt it. No immediately replacement Muhammad Ali plenty great boxers came wake. There is going Usain Bolt time things lessen impact loss. These practical things. What philosophical impact cynicism surrounds sport others? Has gone far? SC: No, has. Sport gone global financial organisations through, Church, royal family. That sport adjust it. What sport has properly understood basis power changed. My federation founded 1912 I predecessors. It come huge relief family I do intend 31 years. I think sport has properly understood average CEO probably stays years. You need oxygen need change. You need churn people coming need outsiders coming in. Sport does monopoly wisdom does need reach out. We far road make sure right things place hold upper ground. The London Stadium sold summer world athletics championships. But lot great things London 2012 undercut cynicism. Do people feel differently cycling athletics then? SC: They probably do. But I do think that permanent shift. The point I'd make broadly that, yes, people want higher standards sport. People want higher standards business, schools, politics, probably families time. That natural human instinct. But I think people capable saying distance sport offer challenges confronting it. We society area does. Does matter feels differently Mo Farah Bradley Wiggins, given allegations them? SC: I people felt complete comfort watching legitimate. The thing I'd say have, justification, greater confidence they watching 20 30 years ago. Systems better. We discussing would 20 30 years ago.

The British & Irish Lions tour approaching rugby equivalent Amen Corner. Negotiate trip all-important middle fortnight successfully possible closing stretch. Get wrong and, professional golfers drop shots Augusta pivotal holes, hard restore sufficient equilibrium. Hence reason penultimate midweek game Highlanderson Tuesday, Test Saturday week, carries significance obvious glance. The Lions badly want maintain momentum generated victory Crusaders numerous examples exist spirited dirt-trackers' playing key roles successful tours. It particularly true New Zealand, Lions performance mercilessly picked over, involves second-string team not. Memories 1993 Lions' heavy midweek defeats Hawke Bay Waikato linger Gavin Hastings' team lost 37-24 Otago build-up Test. Martin Bayfield, Will Carling Scott Hastings injured Test series ended frustrating defeat. If key difference today Lions management conscious mistakes past expeditions. With demanding fixtures NZ Maori Chiefs preceding Test All Blacks Eden Park, Warren Gatland point ensuring player feels vaguely frame Test recognition. His assistant coach, Andy Farrell, emphasised need maintain positive outlook, simply remembered whingeing tourists. With little time prepare cram training ground, Lions pact flying dragged negative factors control. The thing discussed left bitching moaning anything, Farrell said. This schedule it. That touring about. You embrace it. Preparation ideal whingeing tour. We accept that. Instead listened local complaints scrummaging, refereeing dull tactics quiet enjoyment Farrell nonchalant response  They talk something  sums squad collective view deeds words define tour. That applies, Farrell perspective, midweek team bit Test side. We enjoyed Saturday I felt I sat stand watching sense excitement. I want build it.

Beneath fixed roof Forsyth Barr stadium  atmospheric modern replacement old, forbidding House Pain' Carisbrook  priority counter Highlanders' fast-tempo style bears similarities awaits Tests. We got control want play game ready hit breakneck speed, said Farrell, helped mastermind Ireland victory New Zealand Chicago autumn. This type test want that exactly All Blacks fantastic at. We want ball rolling. A key element Highlanders team scoring average tries game Lions' proactive defence, Farrell lookout on-field lieutenants capable constructing impregnable wall. It ai just sprinting line, it adapting situation, Farrell said. It numbers feet covering space. I thought decision-making good Saturday. I looking defensive leaders.

While Couago plies trade Spanish fourth-tier club Alondras CF, team-mates Xavi Hernndez Iker Casillas boast seven Champions Leagues, 13 domestic titles 300 caps alongside World Cup European Championship winners' medals. Couago received Spain call-up. Javier Saviola won Golden Ball Golden Boot, following record 11 goals seven games.

Here argument office week: unpredictable engrossing season AFL football ever. Discuss. If limit frame reference weekend just gone, easy argument make. Usually come winter herd begins thin, weekend Brisbane dismantled Fremantle, Essendon humiliated Port Adelaide 17th-placed Carlton wrung win great deal fun second-placed Greater Western Sydney, evaluating season just effectively shaking Magic 8 Ball watching hours film. In twilight Saturday, days re-signing forward Josh Schache, hitherto unloved Brisbane Lions played like club set free heavy chains  Dayne Zorko hardly bound year, metaphorically otherwise. Through 12 weeks, Brisbane best-and-fairest winner player named Dusty Dangerfield averaged 25 possessions, clearances goal game. By half-time Saturday, he'd racked 19, respectively. In traditional football states, 5ft 9in Zorko like slightly distorted airport announcements do quite catch suspect important. There doubting importance Brisbane, just doubt break thumping 57-point win run losses matters young group like Lions. At point time need emotional nourishment group able tonight, said Brisbane coach Chris Fagan. We got long way go, that brand want play. One club knows little brand Essendon, Saturday went way re-establishing on-field reputation dominating performance Port Adelaide partisan Bomber fans seen coming  anticipated saw Cale Hooker. Hooker won Essendon best-and-fairest defender 2015, point fan frustration online forum contention year John Worsfold persistence playing forward. It ca fun Hooker going key man support act forward, first-half goals, doubting star Etihad Stadium Saturday night. But Sisyphus Essendon. Jobe Watson, Zach Merrett Anthony McDonald-Tipungwuti play exciting, daring fashion delights football world, fans boo Port Adelaide Paddy Ryder time touches ball. Having initially expressed desire remain Bombers supplements saga, scrutiny eventually wore Ryder requested trade end 2014. That Ryder served 12-month ban year 33 team-mates should provide perspective Essendon fans booed. Then again, concern raised week Bomber Nathan Lovett-Murray health daughter (who conceived Bombers' 2012 supplement program) provide sympathetic disposition, cause likely lost one. Sympathy Carlton Football Club strangers time, dying light Sunday afternoon, neutral football fans willing win Greater Western Sydney. In sports exists proxy war proponents high-octane offence practiced Giants traditionalists insist systems inevitably falter superior defence. The traditionalist line thinking is easily marketable club early days rebuild, just it easy sell does mean it worth buying  Blues' players supporters bought in. The primordial game style Carlton reinvention evolving built defensive structure (of Giants, Lachie Plowman Caleb Marchbank important pieces) day Brendon Bolton receive Queen Birthday honours work football foremost civil engineer. Although said Carlton defensive structure built game fundamental principles  spare man. On Sunday, Giants midfielders won twice clearances blew Carlton doors inside 50s. Yet Blues able absorb just Giants threw swing attack agency Sam Docherty. That Docherty regularly spoken All-Australian half-back-flanker surprise who watched progress past years. That Liam Jones spoken influential defender surprise. In list adjectives likely ascribed Jones, influential falls flakey. After indifferent career forward navy blue whipping boy, Jones impressive reading play, flew confidently packs hit target 14 possessions. But player personified passion Carlton gritty one-point win, 150th-gamer Matthew Kruezer. And play personified man club Tractor 11 minutes quarter barrelled opponent, followed kicked ball ground 40 metres arms Dale Thomas set Matthew Wright prove crucial goal. It example Kruezer plays football central trouble life  suspect feeling gets busting packs stick like phantom-limb sensation long football career over. But given 28-year-old career-best form, suspect there fair bit football play yet. And there plenty play unpredictable seasons. Wins weekend Carlton, Brisbane Essendon act footballing rug pulling alteration perspective. There thing certainty unpredictable season  Monday game Melbourne Collingwood 70,000 MCG provided proof that. In undeniably games season, Melbourne headed listless defeat played tired ski-season stereotype kicking goals quarter set anxious final quarter. It set stage Jack Watts exorcise debut demons game years ago, Pies targeted physically mentally ill-prepared draft pick. Paul Roos, coach Watts credits decision stay Melbourne, believes Watts debut merit, virtue marketing stunt  backfired just club, arguably large Watts oft-criticised career. With 90 seconds kick it, Watts grabbed ball just outside Melbourne 50-metre arc, took bounce calmly kicked sealer angle acute Melbourne supporters ride 25 metres hearts mouths. Having played role Melbourne unlikely saviour, Watts extended arms emotion confines English language barely justice. It fitting finale round was, yes unpredictable engrossing  latest instalment year AFL football illustrative broader context times, want better term, uncertain unholy mess. Rafael Nadal observation Paris philosophy life sounded innocuous dip radar correctly concerned history just created describes perfectly playing best tennis career. His words reveal, too, 31-year-old Spaniard, suffered injuries good long-term health, just yet. Very organised people, proactive people, know exactly they going next, Nadal said looking organised possible tennis court demolishing Stan Wawrinka sets win 10th French Open. I things come. Right now, I do really know. I just going playing long makes happy. If day I morning I longer motivated train, well, I guess day I end career. You know what? I worried. I happy person. Like oldest rival, Roger Federer, playing sort freedom known young seen all. It joy carry Nadal Wimbledon final seven years. He win time there. Or, admits, just easily fall early unreliable knees adapt quickly peculiar demands grass, lost world No100, Lukas Rosol, second round 2012. Nadal, players, endured extended periods struggle, love game tested. He expects return. In 2005 emotions dragged directions. He met long-time girlfriend, Maria Francisca Perello, won 10 French championships set journey La Decima Sunday, unprecedented decade winning slam year. However, 2005 year structural weaknesses surfaced feet knees plagued him, great lesser degree, since. He struck 2006, 2009, 2012 2014. In 2013 came nearly months heal ruptured patellar tendons won majors 10 titles posted 75 match victories. It astonishing achievement. Bjorn Borg, slouch dirt, moved the greatest clay-court player play. Carlos Moy, joined eventual coaching successor uncle Toni, described a warrior. Jimmy Connors remarked time: His passion way grinds really special. Because play way easy commitment granted, wondering price pays. Last year quit French Open quick wins wrist injury. Only season begun resemble old Nadal. If looks commanding fierce court  deep the zone Nadal rarely reacts extraneous activity  appears uncertain himself. Eight times answer Sunday evening, used word doubts. For long time pronounced doobts. He knows say proper grasp essence. I honest time, said. I doubts day. If doubts, probably [it] arrogant. I do consider myself arrogant. What surprise Nadal, however, groundswell worthwhile opinion saying win Wimbledon again. It par Federer win Melbourne year, beat Nadal final. Even so,  uncle Toni understudy Moy  previously suggested Nadal conquer All England Club grass again. He told English-speaking press Sunday: I love grass, everybody knows, it surface I really enjoyed lot playing there. However, said Spanish reporters later: Grass speciality, I motivated. He nonetheless reminded beating Wawrinka 6-2, 6-3, 6-1 clay fits script natural clay-courter rediscovered killing top-spun forehand owns backhand nearly lethal. If stays fit healthy, win titles Paris, putting reach record books. That haul alongside Federer 18 majors  sign Swiss finished collecting big silverware. If Nadal rules clay again, Federer likewise ready retake Wimbledon crown. What story draw kept apart Sunday. It years Nadal won possibly best final history grand slam tennis, when, sets unbearable intensity, deconstructed Federer elegance sheer power will, seemed. Before arrived 2008 Wimbledon played final Roland Garros. Nadal won 61, 63, 60. It humiliating experiences Federer career. Now Wawrinka felt French heat Nadal Wimbledon. It foolish predict Spanish master double again. The debate medals prized morals Olympic sport escalated revelation talented young women training view sporting glory allege sexually abused pursuit dream. British Canoeing police currently investigating claims. These sportswomen trust coach claim took advantage deplorable way. Once gives rise questions duty care athletes, discussion reignite Wednesday long awaited publication independent report culture British Cycling sparked claims bullying discrimination cyclist Jess Varnish. It 14 months Varnish claimed performance director Shane Sutton cruelly advised get having baby ditched high performance squad. He remarked too big ride certain roles team. The affair took twist independent British Cycling review cleared Sutton charges itself sanitised findings grievance officer leaked UK Sport commissioned report, final version released week. Disabled riders said referred wobblies gimp, six-time Paralympic champion Darren Kenny claiming felt bruised experiences British Cycling bear display medals publicly home. Sutton denied claims. But Kenny sadness face enormous success raises potent point joy sport lost relentless clamour shiny metal wave around. And UK Sport, funding body allocated millions pounds exchequer lottery money, asked robust questions safeguarding, mental health athlete representation. The independent report expected make uncomfortable reading governing body, British Cycling, discovering course 90 separate interviews riders staff felt bullied discriminated against. But expected criticise funding agency UK Sport failing demand accountability, missing opportunities identify management shortcomings British Cycling years earlier spare heartache. It just cycling canoeing, Britain best funded Olympic sports  receipt 50m four-year cycle  conducting internal investigations. British Swimming looking claims bullying Paralympic athletes. An elite coach alleged belittled criticised athletes, leading culture fear. Meanwhile medical staff GB Taekwondo raised concerns UK Sport coaches' practices regard concussion, weight loss training loads, including suggestions athletes asked train saunas. According UK Sport, independent review insufficient evidence support allegations. It overblown say UK Sport midst crisis. The contrast medal-based success stark. In Rio British athletes best medal haul. While clearly good scenes  world-class facilities, coaching enviable attention training competition  case no compromise model reviewed entirely. The idea no compromise minted Peter Keen, set motion marginal gains led transformation British Cycling 1998 years later oversaw introduction Olympic sport whole. It enormously successful. Great Britain catapulted world standings, 36th place solitary gold Atlanta Olympics 1996 second USA summer. The accompanying lottery money allowed athletes devote entirely training, paying accommodation, food range support services, physiotherapy sports science nutrition. Alongside performance director culture took hold, individual given power run programme relative autonomy. Varnish said case select British Cycling having ultimate power decide future athletes. She maintains decision renew contract personal objective assessment ability potential, scant opportunity recourse. Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson, 11-time Paralympic champion, conducted government-ordered year-long review duty care published April. It seven broad recommendations, create Sport Ombudsman power hold national governing bodies account duty-of-care failings. It suggested British Athletes Commission, organisation supports athletes feel route making complaints governing body, independently funded government. It presently funded UK Sport presents own, perceived real, problems conflict interest. If Grey-Thompson proposed reforms acted on, way making sure athlete welfare gold standard Great Britain Olympic performance. It rains ticker-tape parade remind England Under-20s easier conquer world obstacles litter path regular Premier League football comfort roots triumph South Korea. Sunday World Cup success, England best return international stage 1966, repaid willingness Football Association Premier League act concerns youth development country. A change attitude Premier League clubs bring reward. Lewis Cook, England captain, just hoisted aloft Under20s World Cup following victory Venezuela Suwon debate began future prospects Paul Simpson players  tone inevitable, understandable foreboding. The 13 players featured final England ran combined total 1,094 minutes Premier League season, roughly equivalent 12 matches, Cook having most, 431 minutes Bournemouth midfield. The match-winner Dominic CalvertLewin, Englishman score World Cup final, comes 346 minutes Everton followed club-mate Ademola Lookman 287. The time slips away Josh Onomah 17 minutes Tottenham Hotspur seven played Sunday play single minute Premier League football season. The suspicion final good gets England team deepened goalkeeper Freddie Woodman, fresh making fine crucial late penalty save, admitted future Newcastle United uncertain having spent season loan Kilmarnock Scottish Premiership. Those playing statistics indicative league financial pressures incentives encourage patient development risks young talent; competition owners concerned grabbing additional money broadcasting revenue pool international fortunes foreign land. But efforts clear pathway homegrown talent Premier League dismissed England world champions under-20 level, long-term benefits seen senior level. For FA victory South Korea rewards decision bring uniformity England coaching age levels, seek greater cooperation Premier League coaches improve team cohesion St George Park base. Six Sunday squad featured England European Championship success under-17 level 2014  Golden Ball winner Dominic Solanke, Jonjoe Kenny, Woodman Josh Onomah  starting Venezuela. More recent arguably important changes taken place Premier League attempts counter accusations blame England lamentable record. England problem past producing talent deliver under-18 level. The problem, articulated procession Premier League managers, lack competitive opportunities players 18-21 age bracket. Spain developing men age England players overprotected, said one. There appears little chance Football League allowing Premier League B' teams midst, Spain, competition improved age level following consultations leading coaches recent years. Last season brought introduction Premier League 2 replacement under-21 Premier League, exposing youngsters competition under-23s, relegation promotion divisions play-offs second tier. It cure-all means start ended Everton winning title sending players Under-20 World Cup. There 20% increase playing time homegrown debutants Premier League season, 716 minutes average, compared 596 minutes 2015-16. David Unsworth, Everton under-23s coach, played England finished 1993 Under-20 World Cup squad graduate senior side. He rare voice support much-criticised Checkatrade Trophy season, arguing competition heightens pressure academy players embraced. But ultimately, insists, individual quality determine Simpson squad establish Premier League. They enjoy moment lifetime, said Unsworth. They enjoy away rest. Then need come flying pre-season  I sure will. All great lads desperate going club. They proving themselves. Just come ranks does mean divine right play team. They need prove single day training need earn places. They best there. It encourages Calvert-Lewin, Lookman Kenny, performances South Korea showed Everton need enter transfer market summer sign cover injured Samus Coleman, Ronald Koeman prepared trust club young talent season. The goes Mauricio Pochettino Tottenham needs follow suit England world champions build achievement. English football people say look young players, maybe play 15 20 games more, Koeman said season. They afraid. Sunday offered alternative. There higher-quality games cricket tournament taut finish. Beyond dropped catches (there plenty those) overthrows wanton strokes end Cardiff sunniest day far wonderful tension knock-out cricket generate. At end Pakistan scraped victory straightforward. They won wickets needed eighth-wicket partnership 75 captain, Sarfraz Ahmed, Mohammad Amir line. Sarfraz produced captain innings 61 badly dropped 38 culpably 40 Sri Lanka faltered field closing overs. This victory means England meet Pakistan Cardiff semifinal Wednesday. They happy surface suit team (their bowlers batsmen). There encouragement bowlers tournament likelihood lateral movement fast men greater Wales England. There pace pitches Cardiff good bowlers sporadically movement. In earlier games Tim Southee, Liam Plunkett Mark Wood gained assistance grass, Eoin Morgan described thatchy. Pakistan, especially introduction Junaid Khan replacement volatile Wahab Riaz alongside Amir Hasan Ali, triumvirate pace bowlers adept exploiting help. Hence dangerous opponents England Sri Lanka been. Their pace trio effective Monday. Between took wickets debutant seamer Fahim Ashraf picking two. Such conditions favour Pakistan style play. They equipped chase mega-totals batting lineup described old-fashioned  exception newcomer Fakhar Zaman, left-hander wastes time. But mega-totals Cardiff guaranteed. On cloudy, mercifully dry day Sri Lanka restricted modest total 236. Amir Junaid combined puncture Sri Lankan effort, taking wickets runs overs. Hence innings subsided 167 seven significant restoration Asela Gunaratne Suranga Lakmal managed raise target 237. Sri Lanka looked target more. After early loss Danushka Gunathilaka, Niroshan Dickwella Kusal Mendis combined add 56 enchanting runs. One ramp wicketkeeper head Dickwella Junaid shot startling impudence skill; Kusal Mendis oozed quality orthodox manner. However, Mendis defeated lethal in-ducker Hasan Ali Dinesh Chandimal dragged second ball stumps. Now Angelo Mathews expertly resuscitated innings alongside Dickwella Sarfraz summoned opening bowlers tandem. Mathews, maybe surprised extra pace Amir, bowled inside edge; Dhananjaya Silva nicked beauty Junaid, fierce introduction tournament man just called replacement Kusal Perera. Next Dickwella brilliantly caught Sarfraz inside edge; Pakistan captain swamped colleagues excitement recognition extraordinary one-handed take. Thisara Perera soon followed heart ripped Sri Lankan innings. The Sri Lankan attack does possess potency theirs team granite resolve. When Pakistan 74 loss 12th game over. But spirited bowling panicky Pakistan batting soon stop notion. At start chase Fakhar, licence swing, drove lustily, taking fours Lasith Malinga Azhar Ali watchful partner. Fakhar reached 50 34 balls promptly caught boundary. No matter; older grafters surely Pakistan destination. It simple. Those grafters contrived spoon nick catches Sri Lankans calm leadership Mathews started believe. Pakistan plummeted 137 Sarfraz suggesting permanence. In came Fahim international knock cricket acquired technicolour tension. A bouncer Malinga hooked crowd Fahim mark; top-edged wide long leg fielder. He starting enjoy this. Perhaps uncluttered novice trick, 25 runs added rapidly. Then firm straight drive Sarfraz flicked fingers bowler Perera hitting stumps. Fahim bat line touching turf dream over. Sarfraz Amir stayed cool; Perera mid-on dropped sitter Malinga duped Sarfraz, biggest decisive mistake error-strewn magnificent match. Mark Wood revelling role Eoin Morgan bubble-wrapped strike bowler heads Wednesday semi-final Cardiff chest puffed faith captain showing him. England near peril-free passage knockout stages Champions Trophy, sees management mulling just single spot Jonny Bairstow prepares replace misfiring Jason Roy, owed n on-song bowling attack boasts Wood game-breaking 90mph missiles. A career-best 33 Australia Saturday included wickets David Warner Steve Smith, thirds deliveries dot balls, reward bowler battled chronic ankle injury pace trajectory provides point difference Morgan right-arm seam attack. It nice feeling confidence captain, said Wood, set group-winning performance New Zealand wicket key man Kane Williamson. Subconsciously I do know makes try little bit harder, moment I getting best players out. It nice knack hopefully I up. You lift up, push shoulders back, puff chest little bit, feel like captain really needs want man changes game. Wood returned summer bouts ankle surgery pace enthusiasm seemingly undimmed.

It great north-east lads ones carrying team minute, said Wood, hint mischief thrown in. There north-east pride. Being county distance away others, we considered tight-knit group Durham. But England group feel just tight one. Everyone wants well, lads are playing pushing team genuinely want well. We got hell team I absolutely love it. Wood spoken refreshing honesty players claim look far ahead, second Ashes-winning son Ashington, Stephen Harmison, open targetting winter tour Australia defence urn recaptured 2015 detonated Nathan Lyon stumps Trent Bridge.

Considering went 60 Test matches scoring try, Cole qualified member Lions squad pass judgment subject pithy assessment accurate, showing disregard aesthetics. The fact remains Lions managed just tour matches cause concern, panic restricting Crusaders just penalty, said certainty end All Blacks' unbeaten run Eden Park scoring tries. Sam Warburton said Lions need score 20 points beat New Zealand defeats All Blacks averaged 33 points 12-3 win Crusaders alleviated pressure brought Blues defeat, attack needs refinement.

For lineout drive dazzling, length field score Ihaia West, worth points rolling maul ought Lions' potent weapons.

Even National Hockey League commissioner Gary Bettman appeared ice level Sunday night Nashville award Stanley Cup Pittsburgh Penguins, fans Bridgestone Arena chanting Bettman sucks. Most likely, hatred spawned directly fact Predators, lost 1-0 Penguins decisive Game 6, tally early on, mystifying referees. Early second period, Predators shot deflected glove Penguins goaltender Matt Murray, Predators centre Colton Sissions tapped in. But reason, play whistled dead, goal disallowed. NO GOAL.The refs blew whistle puck crossed line. #StanleyCup pic.twitter.com/Hg9etK1EAa It weirdly fitting bookend series, unfortunate Predators. In period Game 1, Preds defenceman PK Subban scored Nashville 1-0 defending champions. But Penguins utilized newly-introduced feature NHL, coach challenge, review determined Predators offside. The goal called back. Nothing taken away Penguins this. Pittsburgh team post-salary cap era NHL win back-to-back Stanley Cups. The victory ends amazing season team captain, Sidney Crosby. Crosby started season leading Canada victory World Cup Hockey; finished second Conn Smythe trophy, awarded valuable player postseason. Yet, stories tell Pittsburgh, other, smaller, stories tell 2017 Stanley Cup final  including Subban, league interesting player had, thanks post-game chirping, unnecessarily provoked Crosby career performance  story year belongs Nashville. And belongs Nashville, belongs man Predators fans booed mercilessly finally emerge Sunday night  man responsible bringing team place: Gary Bettman. There reasons Bettman generally disliked NHL fans, booing presents Cup year annual tradition Nashville took gusto. It Bettman, example, league undergone number game-play changes, including 3-on-3 overtime, hated shootout. It Bettman coach challenge introduced. It Bettman NHL recent lockouts. And Bettman obstinately refuses admit connection concussions CTE. But atop list reasons fans like boo Bettman watch league morphed fantasize NHL not: big business. When ask hockey fans annoys NHL, answer simply big. Specifically, fans decry teams places teams  places southern United States Florida, Georgia, Arizona (coming soon!) Nevada  fewer teams places think (Markham, Quebec City, Hamilton Seattle). Expansion, turns out, harshest word hockey. Unless, course, works. In announcing NHL plans expand Nashville Columbus, return hockey Atlanta Minneapolis-St Paul, June 1997, Bettman told Associated Press moves position league significant growth stability head century. He wrong came Atlanta. He wrong long time Columbus. But right Minnesota. And, clear, nearly 20 years Predators took ice, eventually pretty right Nashville. You know somebody says just rings head; just right start? That beginning. This, apparently, idea Nashville, Tennessee hockey town began, according account team original owner, Craig Leipold. Nashville ticked boxes Bettman: stadium awaiting major league franchise, NBA NHL; potential ownership; right kind market. Still, [i]t just straight statistical thing, told Leipold. All economic indicators there, I believed sustain franchise. But, Bettman said, intangibles, also. My gut told city it, said. It did. Through seasons, Leipold lost $70m, 2007 rumours set sell team tech billionaire Jim Balsillie (who wanted team). Despite putting consistently competitive squads, Preds saw average attendance fall just 13,000 game 2006-07 season, 9,000 season ticket holders. But deal Balsillie materialized, meantime, Tennessee-based ownership group came fore managed team Nashville. But it were hockey fans  were initially Predators fans. In 1990, General Motors opened plant Spring Hill, Tennessee, then-tiny town half hour drive south Nashville, manufacture Saturn line. Six thousand employees Michigan relocated time. When heard, years later, Nashville getting NHL team, Red Wings fans lured chance hometown team play. But, Jordan Ritter Conn chronicled recently Ringer, fans eventually morphed honest-to-goodness Predators fans. And Nashville eventually gave displaced hockey fans  plenty Nashville natives adopted team  new place home: Smashville. Frank Glinsky came term  town where big hits hockey met smash hits country music  Predators searching 2002 new slogan season ticket sales bump, submitted it. The concept  relaunched 2009 marketing firm GS&F  placed Preds centre city-wide party. It Smashville attitude writ large showcased town embrace team, Predators run special. Every game night, thousands people filled streets Bridgestone Arena. Inside, party taken level  perpetually local bar. NFL football players chugged huge beers box seats; mascot drove ATV ice; different country star sang national anthem night; catfish, thrown stands, occasionally littered ice. Veteran Canadian broadcaster Bob McKenzie described simply as: Cup final like other. But 2017 finals cement Nashville legitimate hockey town; marked end chapter NHL expansion story. Before month out, league hold expansion draft, time aid creating team Las Vegas. The Golden Knights, southern team, ice start 2017-18 NHL season. Shortly league announced decision grant Vegas franchise, Gary Bettman told Sports Illustrated having team city enhance league whole. The people Las Vegas  people live work  going embrace team, Bettman said. Perhaps way we know right time if, day, Golden Knights Predators Sunday night, Gary Bettman takes ice Vegas roundly booed. A familiar American phenomenon force rise Christian Pulisic past year  US soccer fan writer proclaiming Pulisic real deal, there fretting Freddy Adu, dangers hope, soon, placed shoulders 18-year-old.

But USMNT circles pretending Pulisic brightest: Bruce Arena called a big boy now. Against Trinidad, Pulisic urgency reaching ball ahead Clint Dempsey goal symbolic feel. Pulisic vs Dempsey zero sum choice, it clear games, it impossible players sort roaming brief.

Bruce Arena wondered bothered come saw reaction appointment. The experienced American coach game treated underwhelming choice announced Klinsmann replacement. Even arguments safe pair hands, suddenly World Cup qualification emergency, damn faint praise. There advantages too, course.

You asked he option there, I think is. He player who comfortable receiving possession, attributes capabilities play holding midfield player. He obviously has yet, really, that decision make. But I believe play role? Absolutely. Stones unused substitute World Cup qualifier Scotland Saturday injury restricted 13 minutes first-team football City weeks campaign.

The outcome ended Americans' 30-game home unbeaten run World Cup qualifiers dos cero scoreline streak. When US lost Costa Rica couple days later, Jurgen Klinsmann tenure head coach doomed. Arena said win Trinidad & Tobago week change team; transformed it, seven new names starting XI. Perhaps surprisingly, in-form Tim Howard, played Americans' win Azteca, 1-0 friendly victory 2012, rested replaced goal Brad Guzan. Geoff Cameron, Bradley, DeAndre Yedlin Christian Pulisic retain places; left Jorge Villafana injured. The energetic 21-year-old, Kellyn Acosta, FC Dallas, came act midfield disrupter formation 3-4-3 possession. It sort dramatic rotation that, Klinsmann dug-out, inspired insinuations competence and/or sanity. But Arena pedigree, demeanour current performances team inspire trust judgment. The short rest games undoubtedly factor; another, perhaps, points collected T&T, Arena afford experiment venue avoiding defeat felt likely long-shot matter picked.While Arena understandably fretted potential physical effects Azteca high altitude factor competitive advantage risked exaggerated; Mexico line-up play club football country. The pace game hardly dipped night wore on, teams seeking winner. The 18-year-old Pulisic US get-out-of-mediocrity free card, fitful 2-0 win T&T Denver suburbs Thursday, scoring second-half goals. On Sunday, quieter, adroit run pass set chance Yedlin late half, audacious attempted sand-wedge pass line cleared. Pulisic boldly predicted victory ahead game. He opportunity make prophecy come true minutes remaining fashioned enticing chance, shot wide edge area. This time, once, headline-maker. It kind intense occasion benefitted firm officiating. But minutes, Salcedo lucky escape booking elbow DaMarcus Beasley, seconds later, ought sent flailing arm caught Bobby Wood. Then came Bradley: Toronto FC midfielder second international goal July 2015 rare moment adversity Osorio; second goal Mexico conceded Hex matches. Chicharito levelled 20 minutes set clear, ball bouncing, mishit lob Guzan injured himself colliding goalkeeper, played on. The contest tied soon after. On counter-attack, Beasley  US-record fifth cycle World Cup qualifiers  unable stop Vela cutting inside dribbling edge penalty area, giving angle lash low shot Guzan. The US defender Omar Gonzalez fluffed free header inside Mexico box teams looked dangerous, went break locked 1-1. More direct Mexico  worked ball search space visitors closed effectively  US spirited second half created couple half-chances. Still, Mexico scored 20 minutes left Hector Herrera cannoned free kick Guzan crossbar. Then came Bradley effort hit post. As rain fell Mexico City, Americans held amid late pressure. With goalscoring turn stars solid displays lesser lights, Arena choice players vindicated suggests degree depth kind selection problems managers relish US heads summer Gold Cup feeling good making Russia. Harry Kane late, late intervention prove final weekend blow landed Gordon Strachan shuddering one. I absolutely shattered, Strachan said. That probably emotional I game. Slovakia Group F victory Lithuania Saturday evening means Scotland remain fourth section, points adrift second third. World Cup qualification remains long shot, pulsating boost afforded Scotland Leigh Griffiths outstanding double England gave Strachan reason believe. I would I did, manager insisted. If I did believe I think rub players. The players sniff that. Strachan situation has, course, intrinsically linked struggles preceded March win Slovenia briefly stirring events Saturday. It certain 60-year-old campaign, apart commercially practically useful Scottish FA terms sourcing replacement. I got way dealing it, Strachan said regarding speculation. What makes strong players everybody I met week. People come say: Keep up, going.' That energises you. You know I barrier myself media. It guys. I job, does affect me. If affected affect players. You seen performances couple years. I got problem that. Funnily enough, somebody said: Would full-time [club] management?' I said: Yeah, group I would.' I actually excited it time them. I just love working them. We faults, know faults  that fault, that Scottish game. That widespread chasm Scottish players English counterparts lost sane observer, albeit Strachan regularly guilty underplaying talent actually disposal. Teams pull fared better Scots Strachan guidance. A case point relates Griffiths, Strachan showed real reluctance play recently. The manager claim simple mistake pointing Christophe Berra player Hearts team who finished sixth Scotland disingenuous; not, just centre-back virtually everpresent player season Ipswich Town Championship, division Strachan drawn heavily. Berra actually Scotland best players Saturday. Listen, improve, Strachan said. But that different story. We sit night talk things make better group. In general, improve lot whole, Scottish players. What ca say, though, improve work rate. Unless stand tunnel [English] guys knocked do know it like. It like rugby come pack pack keeps knocking back. It drains you. That happened guys. It drains you. But kept finding energy somewhere. Scotland helped England maintaining imperious qualifying form teams group. I hope so, Strachan said. That 35 games unbeaten [in tournament qualifiers] it closest they losing record. We moment day lot football wo forget. We remember noise second goal forever. It best ever. If leave memorable moments given game. Griffiths close national hero. His international manager drew comparisons David Beckham memorable free-kick goal England Greece 2001. Some people 20 minutes they fresh, Strachan said. For Leigh dig late incredible. I actually thought second well, I really did. Harry Kane spoken pride captaining country insists England boast plenty leaders ranks Gareth Southgate contemplates wear armband permanent basis. The Tottenham Hotspur forward, does captain club side, fifth captain Southgate sevengame tenure Wayne Rooney, Gary Cahill, Joe Hart Jordan Henderson Hampden Park Saturday seized opportunity scoring team 93rdminute equaliser. That timely intervention, just moments free-kicks Leigh Griffiths taken Scotland verge win fixture 17 years, maintained England unbeaten qualifying campaign Group F. I said I love England captain, said Kane, previously denied chance represent Southgate team injury goal national team 13 months. Obviously, I do know gaffer feeling it. He gave armband Saturday I went gave best. When pitch, changes. We got leaders team, just I wearing armband. I play way. I talk, I shout way. That good team. People look player drag through, plenty leaders team try change game. For great goal captain, gaffer chooses long-term, plenty leaders. It quite emotional given chance. The manager told just training Friday. He said sees leaders team, it. Nothing permanent. I sure make decision ready, I delighted lead team out. There lot emotions, lots proud feelings, family delighted. It I dreamed about, kids do. So given opportunity gaffer game panned out, manage score minute proud moment. It probably special moment, personally, career far. I want lose game captain, sure  especially Scotland. So score goal  I scored goal England. It special feeling me. Kane took steps international level Rooney leadership, having broken Spurs team Hugo Lloris  France first-choice captain  wearing armband. A good captain leads example, pitch, Spurs forward said. You responsibility pitch media, kids coming through, role model. I quite calm character. I gets irate low. I steady mind I know ambitions, I know I want do, team great ambition. I captain. When I came England squad, Wazza great me. He talked me. Even I doing club giving little phone text say: Things change play bigger.' He great that, giving experiences gone through. I played Hugo Lloris, France captain, I Tuesday. He totally different. He calm, respect him. I great captains career far I I happy. Joe Hart admitted idea playing club football season firm offers having lodged services, confident Manchester City price market seeks fresh start summer. The England goalkeeper, sit friendly fixture France Paris Tuesday Gareth Southgate expected offer Jack Butland appearance 15 months, high-profile early victim Pep Guardiola tenure Etihad Stadium just completed season-long loan Torino Serie A. The Italian club seeking make transfer permanent, coach, Sinisa Mihajlovic, suggesting afford Hart 110,000-a-week wages, Hart spoken personally City rejoining ranks. The club signed uncapped Brazilian goalkeeper Ederson Benfica 35m leave Hart doubt future club joined 11 years ago. No clubs crystallised yet, Hart accept opportunity outside elite bracket, potentially pay cut, likes West Ham United, Everton, Newcastle United Crystal Palace secure Premier League side. Something going happen, way another, it hands businessmen now, said. They obviously signed new keeper, I direction [in moving]. There real need talk them. I lucky management deal things. I think spoke agent. There animosity teams; going business, going ours. Look, I love poker-straight answer I season, I got moment. I'd love withholding information' future, I do information withhold. People focused international duty respecting players focused international duty. Come Tuesday night, conversations people start real. My personal situation interesting, patience going key. City spent 50m Ederson Claudio Bravo Guardiola determined Hart distribution standard required, pair competing No1 jersey Etihad. Asked knew club asking price be, Hart said: I do know exactly. It hard say realistic'. Football business, end day. You ca judge, realistically. The millions zillions pounds paid come play football you, real world, strange. In business world, football world, it not. But I certainly do think going try price move. I think there respect player club work together. There point working [each other]. There animosity two. They going direction I need mine. It considered market value gets agreed clubs. Yet Hart, kept clean sheets 36 games Torino criticised club president, Urbano Cairo, claimed surprised number mistakes goalkeeper made, conceded departure permanent move. If switch needs happen, that key, need stability life, said. I kid more. I ca just pack stuff, like 17 19-year-old, loan. I 30-year-old man stuff I need organise. I like stability. There ideal situation come perfect. It short career football crazy, I prepared anything. I just want play football. I love football. It I live breathe, I want play football highest possible level I play. That plan. The England goalkeeper beaten late Leigh Griffiths free-kicks Hampden Park Saturday, Harry Kane salvaged point stoppage time, absence Stade France number changes Southgate side. Butland represented country fracturing ankle friendly win Germany March 2016 likely start, Fraser Forster Tom Heaton squad. It difficult, listening Joe Hart version events, suspect putting time legitimate debate position  future Manchester City, idea end and, understandably, little old assuredness  warrants place England team. Hart just videos free-kicks Leigh Griffiths wild finish England 2-2 draw Scotland indication goalkeeper 71 caps, years level clean sheets position Peter Shilton David Seaman, considered himself fault. As goalkeeper, set wall up, there do, Hart take. He produced bits quality. They were sidefoots, were curlers, I heavy'  boring goalkeeping technical term. He wall, picked pace say done. I went end say that personality, hate love it. I wanted congratulate talk I interested thought process, too. To twice minutes, really having sniff game, big moment him. He took minute game Wembley used different technique. It free shot 25 yards unfortunately training paid off. I asked wall jump excessively people clever underneath, I seen needed Peter Crouches wall make difference. What say? Sometimes just say done. And right, extent, bearing mind lopsided attention paid Hart goalkeeping elegance strikes  left, right  Scotland striker. Unfortunately Hart, moments left clear impression goalkeeper old truth free-kick aimed fully corner net. From distance, elite goalkeeper normally beaten twice really issue Gareth Southgate England manager concerned way Hart career, age 30, appears drifting. As turns out, Southgate remove team play France Paris Tuesday, decision Hart notified talked devoting time studying free-kick techniques Dimitri Payet Paul Pogba. That, however, Hart dropped, Southgate aware perceived way. Our intention game, Southgate said. However looks, I ride out. I seeing headline says Hart safe' fact need competition position. Who knows fit available [in World Cup]? Too times got tournament key player fully fit. We rely players. All makes perfect sense Jack Butland recovered broken ankle, Tom Heaton Fraser Forster better form England established No1, forgetting credentials Jordan Pickford, currently preparing Under-21 European Championship. Southgate tone supportive, whole, Hart state limbo, Manchester City patchy loan arrangement Torino acutely aware future Pep Guardiola, manager fast-tracked club. In circumstances, zero offers teams, probably surprise Hart fully regained best form ordeal Euro 2016. I sure playing high level, Southgate said. He important experience abroad. His contribution [for England] high save Slovenia worse qualifying group. For me, goals moments high quality, look them. Southgate hope Hart club situation resolved time England resume World Cup qualifying programme Malta Slovakia, Group F second-placed side, start September. In meantime, England captain Terry Butcher calling Southgate change goalkeeper acknowledgement Hart vulnerable. This shirt mine, said. It nailed-on mine, it one. We got high-quality goalkeepers I playing good, well, level, maximum ability, squad. I robot. Sometimes I thoughts [the uncertainty]. But about. It exciting adventure, move, step career, challenge personally. I love personal challenges. I shied away I do intend now. After San Juan need talk Santa Fe.

You X-factor players suddenly come through. We seen previously did radar. You want happen. But, generally speaking I think 80% [World Cup] squad come 45-man squad [announced August]. When Jones speaks X-factor holding portrait Solomona, debut just wild unpredictable dreamt and, such, neat microcosm match. He came 50th minute minutes missed tackles, conceding tries process. England six-point lead transformed itself eight-point deficit  Solomona wondering doing strange land, strange sport. I think just nervous, Jones said. The big occasion got him. But great thing bounced back. He opportunity carry ball fantastic carry. In 79th minute England finally worked ball  remembered spectacularly about, smashing through, stepping streaking away variety hapless defenders winning try. It unreal, said. I think best worst debut I life! It definitely different, lot intense I thought. I ca remember build-up try. I just remember putting ball overwhelmed joy pride. I couple mistakes hopefully redeemed myself. As Solomona, England. The error count half particular high  teams  Argentina, good deal experience, host world-class talent themselves, looked administer kind lesson enjoys having endure. In Pumas' case absentees voluntary, policy selecting home-based players strict All Blacks, retained quality dominate England set piece.

Surpassing all, though, George Ford, best game England shirt, pulling Pumas' defence manner uncomfortable positions racking 25 points. He young stand-off, Jones said. He 24, learning trade I thought certainly good performance. He kept game kept control gave team needed. He definitely kicked well. The moves Santa Fe, Buenos Aires England basing themselves.

Sitting place trailing Serbia Republic Ireland points fifth successive draw, Coleman admitted Wales margin error rest campaign want group.

The bad news Wales Joe Allen miss Austria match suspension picking yellow card Serbia. The good news Bale available again. That Wales coped Real Madrid forward owes performance Ramsey, superb. Playing just Sam Vokes, Wales' lone forward, Ramsey used ball intelligently excellent forward runs relieve pressure stretch Serbia defence. He converted penalty kick remember.

Yes, course Karmichael Hunt massive positive takeaway point  magnificent 12 match-day 23 keeper  but, overall, coach Michael Cheika deeply concerned side atrocious catch-and-pass skills. It glaring inadequacy renders positives moot: Australia lose tier opposition players learn catch pass accurately  means putting ball space support runners, players need check run lose attacking momentum. With exception Australian tries, Wallabies unquestionably poor fundamental aspect game. In fact, showing Wallabies looked adrift All Blacks undisputed masters core skill. Poor catch-and-pass skills blight Australian game nigh decade now, particularly Super Rugby seasons. It reached point excuses regularly trotted out: the Kiwis innately better learn skills younger age, on. Indeed, that reason New Zealand rugby players catch pass default. But it excuse Australian players inadequate now. In fact, Australia used envy rugby world elementary skill set Ella brothers, Michael Lynagh, Stephen Larkham, David Knox, Lloyd Walker leading exponents. There simply is good reason Wallabies lacking basic aspect game. It it  interchange Hunt Bernard Foley Israel Folau away gem try perfect example flawless execution; players coming ball space  space  pace. That classic Wallabies try kind rarely days. If Cheika skills coach Mick Byrne (the All Blacks kick pass specialist) sort Wallabies catch-and-pass basics, Australia competitive All Blacks year Bledisloe Cup/Rugby Championship. On weekend showing though, Wallabies struggle beat Scotland up. Cheika pleased Fijians brought contest. It coaching bonus big learnings away game comfortably won. Too lessons come heartbreaking losses. Unfortunately, lessons Saturday Wallabies captain Stephen Moore, 34, make 2019 World Cup Japan. Moore backing himself improve, unless there sharp upturn showed bench Fiji end him. Michael Hooper permanent captaincy claims irresistible. What Fijians, will, likely qualification permitting, play Australia World Cup pool stages? There mistaking Fiji team rise. Leone Nakarawa magnificent troubled Wallabies end. He truly world class player peak game. The 37-14 scoreline suggests comfortable Wallabies victory far that.

The Irish trailed 31st minute, Martin Hinteregger struck depleted Austrian course revive World Cup qualification hopes dealing blow hosts, incoherent match. But Ireland rallied, equalised forced ball net second time, referee disallow goal supposed foul goalkeeper Shane Duffy, anger Martin O'Neill. With Serbia Wales running Group D looks likely wire Ireland confidence demonstration ability fight finish. Whatever lack, determination bottomless. No personifies better Walters. Jon quickest he got real knowledge game really great will, O'Neill said. He totally invaluable us. Dublin looked picture glowing sun match defaced half. With wayward passes, clunky touches negligible imagination grisly viewing Austria scored goal incongruous quality. The visitors offered smidgin neatness hosts opening half hour foreshadowed artfulness breakthrough. It came corner delivered David Alaba. Aleksandar Dragovic Sebastian Prdl flummoxed Irish defence letting ball run past Hinteregger near penalty spot. He took touch firing past Darren Randolph. There immediate trace Irish riposte.

The goalkeeper, Heinz Lindner, came rescue. Austria rode storm increased lead fine save Randolph. Just visitors sensed victory, Walters struck.

Ben Stokes stride Champions Trophy semi-final Wednesday believing himself invincible present England all-rounder said type carried away performances; unsatisfied, continue striving reach new levels. Having bounced Australia tournament exit door Edgbaston career-best unbeaten 102, Eoin Morgan wins group stage, Stokes underlined status player teams covet added clout argument witnessing oncein-a-generation cricketer. Stokes himself, however, trying ignore hype Indian captain, Virat Kohli, used social media Saturday laud covers generally brutalised Pat Cummins  break wrists add deliberate slice  best shot seen long time. I just shut out, Stokes said. You day good says. You just feet floor. I feel I high I feel I low things. Everyone deal things like differently just I it.

Such acknowledgment aspect 26-year-old game developed past year, subcontinental winter. The Indian Premier League getting praise ignoring evidence say benefits, acclimatisation pressure-cooker stadiums, coping expectation tournament expensive overseas signing 1.7m gleaning advice masala world-class players offer. Steve Smith, Australia captain led Stokes Rising Pune Supergiant, regret offered help. He just gave little tip India, technique, felt help with, Stokes said. I losing backside bit I hitting. The thing IPL exposure big moments games playing huge crowd time. In situations like 35 [against Australia] just mentally look time past reflect confidence knowing situation well. Such situation arose Stokes struck maiden IPL 10 month match Gujarat Lions, winning tournament MVP award season significant (and certainly come year auction) achievement. The experience, according England one-day batting coach, Graham Thorpe, added extra edge player diligent. He felt pressure going different now, Thorpe said. He was lacking confidence  nice way, arrogance  maybe it belief, types players, belongs. Him Joe Root hit balls I seen young players years. You able advice look develop games.

Front-foot no-balls memorable. The sundries column interrogated scorecard, ever. Yet Morne Morkel overstepped South Africa doomed defence 191, Indian partisans roared loud stage romping eight-wicket win. For white-ball foot faults mean free hits; guarantee seeing adored wallopers gold. It moment emblematic fanaticism follows team everywhere, capable overwhelming anyone. In match, Proteas just that: smothered. The seeds' Champions Trophy exit sealed skittish batting effort, punctuated run outs ranging desperate comical course collapse lost wickets 51 runs. Breezy half-centuries Shikhar Dhawan Virat Kohli completed thrashing ease. A perfect South London morning brought sizable expectations, quasi-quarter-finals resolve qualifies final four. The suddendeath nature  teams unexpectedly lost previous fixtures  added heat needed tournament far hindered relentless rain. After in, South Africa slow serviceable start period parity Kohli men. With run-rate pressure building, angst showed wickets. In space balls, captain AB Villiers short single was Faf du Plessis burned David Miller batsmen dived end  22 yards bails removed. It ugly.

Afterwards, De Villiers accepted performance ranks right there   lengthy list defeats nation suffered pointy end major tournaments past quarter-century.

While Hashim Amla Quinton Kock opening partnership reached 75, came better runs over. The MS Dhoni showed lost gloves, snaffling fine low catch bowling Ravichandran Ashwin.

The opener played distinctive innings, multiple occasions pulling rope compact powerful swing. By far game, little South Africa seamers do. Meanwhile, Kohli reached 50 past innings, nearing gear perfect time. To reach final venue Sunday India need overcome Bangladesh Thursday Edgbaston. Using history guide, having defeated easterly neighbour 32 meetings, strong favourites. With Pakistan facing Sri Lanka right play England semi-final Wednesday, teams remain subcontinent.

It impossible overstate fresh sense purpose accompanied entire British & Irish Lions squad south Christchurch Otago. Not sides conquer strong Crusaders team spare result Saturday significant consequences. Not Lions belief New Zealand worst nightmare danger materialising. From New Zealand point view relatively normal weekend. The touring team struggling make impression, local media wind-up mode Crusaders Highlanders treat visitors double shot southern discomfort. Suddenly Warren Gatland offensive, publicly querying legality Super Rugby scrummaging, mangy, jet-lagged Lions week morphed completely different animals. It exaggeration, listening whinging performance French referee, Mathieu Raynal, suggest sections New Zealand rugby community appear rattled. A referee prepared apply laws? A hard-nosed away team decent line speed, aggressive disciplined forwards excellent tactical kickers? None remotely illegal but, reason, Lions accused trampling beautiful game. There glorious moment press conference Lions' team hotel Sunday Kiwi inquisitor asked Gatland team meagre return tries tour matches. How conceded? Gatland retorted, quick flash. Cue lot chin-stroking. These Lions shipped tries 240 minutes New Zealand focusing ledger considerably popular. Of course Gatland team need improve strike rate stage but, Graham Henry observed radio weekend, way win game rugby. The beauty, ugly not, Saturday huge improvement physicality forward control squeezed Crusaders source. Keep progressing fronts 10 days All Blacks stiff challenge hands Eden Park Saturday week. The Crusaders, remember, boasted All Blacks pack yet, aside dominant scrum, trailed second key areas game. With slightly precision Lions scored tries addition Owen Farrell penalties. In scrum, particular, Gatland spoilt choice. Maro Itoje Alun Wyn Jones? Peter O'Mahony CJ Stander? Sam Warburton, Sean O'Brien Justin Tipuric alongside Taulupe Faletau? With All Blacks trio Kieran Read, Dan Coles Jerome Kaino sidelined short recent rugby, far guaranteed New Zealand win meaningful collisions. Add ability Conor Murray Farrell pen opponents deep half judicious kicks hand Lions really tough beat final passes accurate attacking rhythm improves. I thought played excellent rugby, said Gatland, refusing accept Lions negative bunch little recommend them. It time history Crusaders scored points match occasions away home. That team week sixth hotel we we New Zealand. We 13 line breaks, I did negative rugby. In terms scrums Gatland similarly bullish: I felt scrum ascendancy scrummaged pretty well. I little bit surprised huge scrum. I thought referee good job. If look numbers elsewhere, I thought dominated area: lineout, territory, possession, carries, line breaks. It probably help Monsieur Raynal official whistle Chicago Ireland defeated New Zealand autumn; way, Frenchman dislike pre-scrum engagement common Super Rugby concern Gatland. The law says small gap do play law game. So Super Rugby sides tend scrummage illegally that case, said. The scrum going problem us. I think scrum strong time come Test time. Who starts Test midfield remains fascinating debate. For promise Farrell-Jonathan Sexton axis Saturday surprise Gatland prefers Farrell-Te'o-Davies combo 10, 12 13, George North Liam Williams wings and, depending Stuart Hogg fitness, Jared Payne, Leigh Halfpenny Anthony Watson full-back. We got lots options; we just got right ones, Gatland said. I sure lot difference opinion final selection that going challenge us.

The Welsh flanker concedes inclusion certain may ready unless storming game Highlanders Tuesday. Warburton played 66 minutes rugby tour, having strained ankle opening quarter opening game. He finally fit return says hesitate advise Warren Gatland, head coach, pick struggles match form shown Ireland Sean O'Brien Peter O'Mahony 12-3 win Crusaders Saturday. I honest Gats Gats honest me, Warburton said, squad arrival Dunedin. If I play Tuesday I feel I bit undercut, I ready Test. I perfectly honest Warren: I feel I need games, I tell I do feel ready. If I do need any, I obviously let know good performance. Warburton long selfless captains accepts played insufficient recent rugby Test certainty. I definitely need games, Cardiff Blues forward said. I knew coming tour. I received role tour captain I know there chance I involved Test. Maybe situation maybe I blinder Tuesday feel absolutely fine. If I Test, bonus Tests selected be-all end-all.

You know they going start putting Test team pretty soon. He admits feeling momentary panic injury hit opening fixture. It 15 minutes game. I thinking: Oh no, ca happening.' It sore I bumps I tend know it serious. Murray, sustained dislocated finger win Crusaders, clear Lions resting laurels. A couple days ago lost criticism, said. Now we won, people probably bigging up.

L'Equipe running poll website moment, giving readers chance inside Didier Deschamps head select squad 23 World Cup summer. Around 300,000 duly sifted long list picked favourites position. Unsurprisingly, Antoine Griezmann scores highly, included 99% voters' selections. Not far behind, chosen 97%, player win cap Friday. Kylian Mbapp included strength explosive season football latest golden boy, assumption natural level too. This freakishly talented 18-year-old largely kept reserve France recent doubleheader friendly Paraguay, followed shock World Cup qualification defeat Sweden, sprinted late cameo really opportunity make impression. Perhaps chance England Tuesday  desire Griezmann playing just Mbapp attacking spear new-look France understandably enticing  but, sudden, urgency agenda buzzes topic new generation. Is time push change? Is moment right shake largely built components took France final Euro 2016? Those questions lurked shadows postmortems defeat Stockholm, French tried figure earth squandered spot Group A. France game, marked fabulous finishing, reasonable control pressed winner closing stages, turned head death. Sweden players overjoyed scalped France brilliant, opportunistic, stoppage-time strike. Hugo Lloris, presented Ola Toivonen chance unguarded net half pitch away, looked wanted eat gloves kind penance. World Cup qualification suddenly stressful operation France mind. Lloris profoundly apologetic. Deschamps stern-faced straight-talking laid requirement win remaining games. How quickly tone conversation changed. The months France supposed fine-tuning, evolving, Deschamps prising himself away loyalty tried trusted players unleash prodigies place. There demand new wave fast tracked XI. The seemingly unstoppable trajectory Mbapp, silky touches Thomas Lemar darting dribbles Ousmane Dembl make strong cases present future. They look revved ready Deschamps pressure weigh balances offer compared older generation trusts. In Sweden, game Deschamps (rightly) assumed pose physical tactical challenges, France manager reluctant bold. Having integrated exciting full-backs Monaco pair Benjamin Mendy Djibril Sidib, Deschamps chose conservatively attacking positions, mindful young whizzes forward track diligent experienced option. But Moussa Sissoko? Really? Having spent season expensive spare White Hart Lane, struggled match intensity toughest group game two. Such decisions Deschamps wrestles tries sensibly manage integration new wave. Sissoko season shadows vibrant prospect Dembl? Olivier Giroud, weird blend not-quite moments excellent scoring rate  17 goals 17 starts country, including piercingly swiped volley Sweden  wonderkid Mbapp? Dimitri Payet, star Euros, form mid-season dip, purposeful bursts Lemar? France spoiled choice, choices straightforward. It dilemma sorts: loyalty versus audacity. That topic sharper focus World Cup qualification scenario changed. Only group winners guaranteed ticket Russia; France Sweden goal difference, games remaining. How long life team? The question posed French journalist, Vincent Duluc, aftermath quirky defeat Sweden. Deschamps abandon Euro 2016 team, formed basis qualification campaign. But fresh faces ready waiting seize opportunity. How handle friendly England manager food thought. A school thought insists unhealthy crank hype train lever approaches speeds worthy Shinkansen. But  but. Christian Pulisic. Christian Pulisic! CHRISTIAN PULISIC. Christian Pulisic. If hope US face Mexico Estadio Azteca Sunday night, lies 18-year-old small sturdy shoulders. Hard conclude 2-0 World Cup qualifying win Trinidad & Tobago Thursday Colorado. This roster replete decent players capable getting team second round World Cup finals, step farther draw kind. Pulisic, though, early career, looks like he'd belong line-up top-10 nation, expects reach semi-finals. Of outfield regulars biggest reputations, 29, Michael Bradley appears settling role shield sword, disrupting opposition defining flow side attacks. Substituted 61 minutes Thursday, Clint Dempsey subjected coach, Bruce Arena, famous Deuce glare, eyes boring target soul like electric drill bit. That surely reflected natural frustration missing ideal opportunity grab goal bring level Landon Donovan US all-time scoring chart. But it tempting symbolic moment, scene stemming pathos player way knows he ceding status key forward team-mate roughly half age. Pulisic scored second goal game minute Dempsey trudged off. And like Premier League man prime, showed exuberant creator clinical finisher. Forced pick two, it hard choice. Given tend roam final third, making Jozy Altidore selection important static style provides fulcrum attacks, Arena make decision. The US won Mexico, 1-0 friendly victory 2012. Overall, El Tri won 23 26 home games rivals. Starting forwards hubristic. Arena said Thursday intends make changes Sunday match. In high altitude Mexico City, short rest, appear logical 34-year-old bench hotter feet Borussia Dortmund player, seven goals 15 international appearances, coming World Cup qualifiers. He ahead time - gets ball he super comfortable it, he panicking, gets inside box stands defender world oyster. He special, guys do come often, said Tim Howard, US goalkeeper. Will Mexico try intimidate physically, T&T tried Panama them? If I team played I'd certainly target him. Not sure he'd win street fight he stuck tackle, he afraid. He big boy, plays Bundesliga, knows it about, Howard said. But he afraid that huge us. Because look him, he biggest, strongest, teams going come try stuck him. The highest-profile encounter Concacaf Hexagonal qualifying phase way lowest-pressure visitors. Students fixture history, relative positions teams, conclude Americans highly likely lose. Given forgiving nature group, sees teams automatically reach Russia fourth faces play-off Asian side, losing road fatal American prospects long winning home.

They good team they easy beat home it going lot, I think guys have, confidence have, I think there reason ca that, said. Eoin Morgan tipped raucous Eric Hollies stand England chief assets encounter Australia. As captain signalled charge eventually dump rivals Champions Trophy, army assorted bananas, gorillas, Mexicans Nintendo characters duly responded. A burst rain forced break proceedings 3pm. With Jason Roy, Alex Hales Joe Root departed breathtaking surge Australia attack, England 35 overs left mood slightly dank weather; chance send Steve Smith men joys contract dispute home jeopardy. But returning middle, Morgan lit fuse Hollies  Edgbaston  explode. He cracked Mitchell Starc deliveries covers fearless fashion and, it, ramming home point England longer types cowed faced canary-yellow onslaught one-day international cricket. Ben Stokes violent, unbeaten 102 doubtless hog limelight, Morgan 87 breakneck stand 159 pivotal win. He named week Paul Farbrace, assistant coach, standout central figure England one-day revival and, flayed Australia bowlers, felt simply latest slab evidence. Morgan came years outlier: 360-degree cavalier team largely roundheads. After spell reined touch  place questioned dip form thorny Bangladesh tour saga  peak powers batsman, mandate leader swelled. With Stokes nailing coffin Australia soggy campaign flurry boundaries, captain eventual run out, Aaron Finch unfortunate stationing Hollies. The opener enjoys playing England, international hundreds, repeated chants Finchy going home taken edge touch. With Finch Australia dispatched, agonising Roy spot doubtless time Wednesday semi-final Cardiff. Having averaged 6.73 one-day innings summer fair say England entered territory lose little face making switch Jonny Bairstow previously glowing bat. Bairstow history thriving parachuted in, Roy electric outfielding  demonstrated pop-up-and-reclaim boundary catch removed Glenn Maxwell Edgbaston famous stand would compensated Yorkshireman equal prowess. The unknown goes new white ball level. While Roy trough unshiftable headache late, Morgan heartened bowlers. They turned Australia launchpad 181 three, double-the-score mark 32 overs, 276 50, largely backing performance New Zealand pitch offering less. Smith described England bowling strategy predictable match, claiming half battle won already. The other, important, 50% dealing ball leaves bowler hand. Though gaggle fast-mediums shipped runs, Mark Wood Adil Rashid shone brightly. Wood career-best 33 10 overs  England record Champions Trophy  reward bowler doubted return ankle operations. That troublesome joint seemingly holding pace remains encouraging signs knockout stage come small matter Ashes tour. A maiden five-wicket haul box tick Durham quick CV, pelts Hashim Amla, Kane Williamson, David Warner Smith hanging wall summer, curious folk stared solely statistics recognised potential Wood attributes evaporating fast. Rashid 41 startling discipline. No boundaries shipped 10 overs 28 dots wracked Australia batsmen floundered googly. Hollies, Warwickshire great inflicted Don Bradman final-innings duck wrong 'un, doubtless nodded approval. The England support drew unfavourable comparisons oldest rival international football San Marino, suggesting, impolitely, Scotland inferior Europe whipping boys. Below belt, given team problems committed limited occasion England position revel supremacy despite extending unbeaten qualifying record 35 games courtesy Harry Kane injurytime equaliser. The visitors passive face ferocious Scotland start and, despite improving degree control, illustration Joe Hart weakness left-hand side, failing close Leigh Griffiths' free-kick, subdued display final showed strides England need make. It needed introduction Alex OxladeChamberlain Raheem Sterling finally stretch shattered home side. Barring remarkable upturn fortune final matches, painful draw curtailed Scotland World Cup qualifying prospects Gordon Strachan hopes leading country major tournament 1998. Scotland staying home, England fans cruelly, bluntly accurately it. As reaction final whistle testified, Scots knees pitch stands, better, turning point campaign flickered sporadically. Griffiths outstanding free-kick double Scotland sight Hampden win England 1985, Strachan playing, regardless inability hold out, lack attacking options, performance commitment silence debate manager future time yet. Southgate raised eyebrows giving Jake Livermore second start England shirt. Although Eric Dier struggled intensity aggression Scotland counterparts West Bromwich Albion player left manager cause regret. His range passing impressed, posed threats Craig Gordon goal barking instructions leading team Scottish pressure height. His selection, however, underlined limited options available Southgate seeking protect defence, Livermore Dier natural choices central midfield match-day squad. Given scrutiny behaviour England supporters game, criticism flows does cross line, fair report right. Southgate reminded travelling support responsibilities ambassadors country. The message heeded. A minute silence victims Manchester London attacks impeccably observed repeat cringe-worthy songs aired recent internationals. The Scotland taunt Jimmy Saville, he own greeted bewilderment deserved. The sets supporters applauded final whistle. Strachan sprung surprise recalling Christophe Berra Scotland back-line time 3-0 loss England November reverting three-man central defence Kieran Tierney left. The formation restricted Celtic full-back ability support Scotland attack enabled Tierney demonstrate awareness, intelligence timing attracted admirers season Brendan Rodgers' invincible side. Tierney, left, turned 20 Monday, instrumental containing Marcus Rashford denying space England line unfortunate collide Stuart Armstrong Oxlade-Chamberlain broke deadlock. A genuine talent. As past weeks election trail shown, campaign rarely runs straight line. What certain day look unlikely days tipped rest tour securing victory Lions defeated previously unbeaten Crusaders gave New Zealand reasons fearful. One disappointment Lions, kick euphoria relief win needed majority likely start Test, adorn tries. They created chances mixture poor decision-making, lack understanding slack passing pressure cost opening minute. What mattered, though, result manner victory. The strong set pieces complemented resourcefulness breakdown, accurate kicking game suffocating defence maintained chokehold despite backline reshuffle half New Zealand analysts nights. The Crusaders failed score try time April 2015. The conditions aid passing movements Auckland nights Blues stretched Lions defence snapped. The home showed expected intent possession Lions closed space quickly Super Rugby favourites jammed congested midfield. Even Lions kicked long receiver time launch counterattack tourists quick deter long pass, leaving run kick options. Even set pieces, times pressure kick offered relief, Crusaders struggled ball second receiver cramped space. They created half-chances, George Bridge shoved touch half cross kick failing gather Jack Goodhue improvised kick scrum, Crusaders mute attacking force. They struggled French referee, Mathieu Raynal, scrum, penalised staying square engaging early, perturbed felt connivance Lions encroaching feet hindmost player rushed defence. With French officials charge final Tests, New Zealand head coach, Steve Hansen, sure use media conferences pressure Jrme Garcs Romain Poite, officials swayed home pressure 2015 World Cup took charge England group matches Wales Australia. Raynal charge New Zealand lost Ireland Chicago November and, Top 14 mind-numbing major leagues Europe, French officials arguably world best, refereeing consistency. Unlike most, tend provide running commentary, making harder players test tolerance thresholds. The Lions conceded seven penalties, marked improvement Wednesday, Liam Williams sent sin-bin taking player air second time. This time Lions waited catcher hit ground moving in. The kicks Conor Murray precise Israel Dagg proved suspect high ball. Murray, like half-back partner Owen Farrell, significant impact. Farrell moved midfield, operating centre Jonathan Davies failed head injury assessment, Jonathan Sexton coming fly-half. It gave Lions opportunity pair tandem benefited happy accident Anthony Watson replaced injured Stuart Hogg full-back unnerved Crusaders pace elusiveness. Watson option full-back Test priority midfield play Farrell commanding. That fly-half, mean Ben Te'o Jonathan Davies linking midfield. Davies, like Leigh Halfpenny Dan Biggar Wednesday, showed Lions playing Warrenball, keeping ball alive opportunity. It tiki-taka rugby New Zealand come cherish looks sure prevent landslide.

Major League Soccer needs Miami just Miami wants Major League Soccer. Our hope weeks league accept Miami Beckham ownership group. The crucial development approval Miami-Dade commissioners sell three-acre parcel county-owned land Overtown neighbourhood Beckham team, includes music television entrepreneur Simon Fuller, Bolivian telecommunications billionaire Marcelo Claure and, April, financier Todd Boehly, co-owner baseball Los Angeles Dodgers. The group bought derelict site acres privately $19m (15m) March 2016 Beckham needed final piece jigsaw secure MLS approval 25,000-seat, open-roofed stadium. A team league inspectors visited site week. Yet despite breakthrough, MLS product Beckham looks set offer far envisioned February 2014. Then, stage beneath tropical foliage Miami Perez arts museum, Beckham confirmed exercising cut-price $25m franchise ownership option came signing bonus signed five-year deal join LA Galaxy 2007. Miami, declared, the world vibrant city deserving soccer team match, pledged play downtown stadium, possibly 2017. Who would want play Miami? Live Miami? asked, speaking passionately fans walking picturesque waterfront boulevards games state-of-the-art stadium. But little little dream began fall apart, throttled politics Leiweke worked feverishly scenes canvass support mayors commissioners city Miami-Dade county. First, county politicians rejected Beckham proposal build Port Miami, alliance cruise ship operators dockyard workers lamented cargo loaders crane operators replaced peanut-sellers ticket-takers. Then city mayor Tomas Regalado, one-time Beckham ally, went cold county mayor Carlos Gimenez plan disused deep-water slipway build ground grand waterfront park. Stung realisation prime waterfront site eluded him, Beckham announced June 2014 pausing weigh options. Nine months passed venue Miami Marlins' new baseball stadium Little Havana touted, embraced Beckham. But walked away frustrated November 2015, individual owners refused sell despite receiving offers excess real land value. Facing MLS deadline veiled threat award Sacramento league 24th franchise December, group known Miami Beckham United quickly latched vacant Overtown site. The little hasty residents Spring Garden historic district, quiet, leafy neighbourhood Overtown western edge fear ruined noise traffic stadium comes pass. Home Florida original tourist attractions 1890s, Alligator Joe, visitors gathered watch reptile wrestling contests deep pits, Spring Garden remains unspoiled 1920s heyday popular young families. The human side, effects stadium are addressed, said resident Meredith Vey. I elected official, I entertainment mogul I athlete, I just mother trying raise kid small neighbourhood. I feel we betrayed commissioners stars eyes. Another resident, Daeja O'Donoghue, said Beckham team called community meeting 24 hours' notice month said group had diligence. I said, Show studies, traffic studies, feasibility studies,' nothing, said. We want proof going affect us. O'Donoghue said concerned group planned use stadium open-air concerts 15 football games year. Leiweke sought allay residents' fears: People worry we going 20 30 nights concerts disrupt sleeping patterns kids. Not true, said. We going cap number concerts genre music. We committed good neighbour, committed good partner. Amanda Hand, house directly faces western stadium, persuaded. They lot language like we attempt to', try to' intend to', said. There lot aspirations lot guarantees. Aspirations legally enforceable. Celebrity-starved economically depressed, Overtown quite limelight-loving Beckhams mind set sights life Miami. In 2014, start odyssey, Miami Heat defending NBA champions common Beckham courtside seat, chilling friend LeBron James, Heat forward potential partner soccer enterprise. Beckham wife Victoria, Spice Girl, spotted Miami then, eating celebrities Zuma restaurant lounging Soho Beach House, exclusive club footballer uses facto office. Times changed: Heat basketball also-rans James gone home Cleveland. But plenty occupy Beckham Miami as-yet unnamed franchise moves forward. A priority finding big-name coach well-known players deliver immediate success catch Florida new professional soccer teams, stole march Beckham project floundered. Orlando City, joined MLS 2015, signed Brazilian World Cup winner Kaka; Miami FC, unbeaten games year second season junior North American Soccer League, part-owned Italy captain Paolo Maldini. Beckham said disrespectful speculate potential players, especially years team plays game. But Peter Wilt, launched Chicago Fire MLS 1998 franchise founding general manager, said Beckham status connections attract big names eager league planned expansion 24 teams 2020. David allure gives advantage start, said. It dissipating advantage gets away playing days celebrity status, there there. Working Tim Leiweke, doubt he smart strategic bring athletes coaches allure. Wilt said Beckham challenge make supporters feel club. Miami of, difficult, sports market nation transient population, said. If emotionally connected team they make sustainable. We thank God, truly good Jamaica. You blessed doctor, honourable Usain St Leo Bolt, embodiment sportsmanship, reminds gumption indomitable spirt Jamaican people. May vibe stadium bring world justice love, make kingdom Earth heaven. Amen. Major sporting events supposed start prayers ordained minister, impeccably observed righteous amens right places. Yet, inevitably, proved perfect prelude Usain Bolt 84th race Jamaica. This occasion akin religious experience, five-hour outpouring love joyous exaltation 35,000 people greatest athlete history. Salute To A Legend, called it. And salute did. Whether buttockdeadening $8 wooden bleacher seats dignitaries grandstand, Bolt appeared reaction classless overwhelming, roars claps blasts vuvuzelas sounded army mosquitoes invading Kingston. Afterwards 30-year-old admitted rarely nervous race. It National Stadium 2002  winning world junior 200m title 15-year-old beating athletes years senior. And now, suddenly, hitting home circle athletics life rapidly bolting shut. Even presence mind treat crowd greatest hits. As athletes lined 100m, shadow-boxed like prizefighter master ceremonies stirred crowd greater frenzies rattling achievements preacher force certainty. Then, gun went off, customary terrible start, leaving blocks grace backache climbing favourite easy chair. Yet 50 metres ahead away  and, always, simply uncatchable. His time 10.03sec special, him. Then again, having missed weeks' training death close friend Germaine Mason motorbike accident  Bolt scene  going be. Afterwards brutally honest performance. I think possibly worst races, said. My execution poor, start poor always. I think bit I lost little. But I did expect spectacular I lot time off. The weeks I missed rough. But people Jamaica really came me, thank showing support. As Bolt crossed line mobbed cheerleaders photographers bouquet fireworks lit Kingston skyline. His lap honour long delirious climbed stands celebrate friends family going track party Jamaican dancehall legend Beanie Man. Of course going lose  Kingston especially dice loaded favour. Any athlete conceivably beaten tougher 100m earlier evening, won compatriot Yohan Blake, London 2012 silver medallist, 9.97sec. Afterwards, Blake asked friend boots day, shook head. He leaves size 13 shoe fit it hard fit, admitted. I try squeeze foot it. Not sentimental. The young South African Akani Simbine, finished second Blake, asked wanted ruin Bolt retirement world championships London August. That plan, said, smiling. Beforehand Bolt indulged crowd pre-race laps honour, open-topped car velodrome surrounding track, foot. Then came big bear hug Sebastian Coe, International Association Athletics Federations president, shovelled praise 100m 200m world record holder eight-times Olympic gold medallist. Our words, best, small, modest contribution eulogies tributes great man standing received, Coe told him. But words modest, thanks mountainous. Peter Phillips, leader Jamaica opposition, People National Party, effusive. You greatest Jamaican time, told him. You set new limits human capacity speed records performance endure history. Not outdone, Jamaica prime minister, Andrew Holness, came dressed Puma tracksuit and, putting hand Bolt shoulder, called a great man, great athlete great Jamaican. Bolt, wisely, intends stay far away politics possible retirement. He offered place government culture sports minister urged start making Baby Bolts good nation. Such ability unite Jamaicans, party declared surely win landslide. Seven Olympic champions come Kingston pay tribute Bolt victories them, including Britain Mo Farah 3,000m. But South African Wayde Van Niekerk produced performance night winning 200m 19.84sec. That personal best fastest time year reminder, perhaps, Bolt decided run 100m 4x100m relay world championships. That, though, discussion day. This night, like track past decade, belonged Bolt. An injury fly-half Joey Carbery, kicks charged tries, interrupted win Ireland Test showed gap exists haves have-nots rugby. In truth, USA did: John Mitchell Eagles drilled lead overseas pros: Sale fly-half AJ MacGinty New Zealander Tony Lamborn openside flank. Still, lack time semi-pros key positions fed familiar problems: scrum struggled, defensive line ran ragged little soon. Joe Schmidt Ireland, Lions starting bench, holes ran game. Joey just sprained ankle bit, said Schmidt. We thought pertinent off. We do know story yet. It has swelled bit tender. We settles scan arrive Tokyo. Mitchell, All Blacks head coach, leave Eagles end summer series, continues Georgia week two-legged World Cup qualifier Canada. We outclassed today, said. We disappointed, defensively issues setting cost us. Mitchell said did expect first-choice scrum lose inches, contributed Ireland finding 50 easy. In event, Ireland strength, 11 British Irish Lions, currently touring New Zealand. For thing Keith Earls, Munster wing toured South Africa 2009 Lions. Whatever New Jersey equivalent screaming ab-dabs be, Americans got Earls carrying ball. His team-mates noticed carried often: wing, it, end kicks space. Two minutes marker, Martin Iosefo, rushed up, allowing space Tiernan O'Halloran break tackle Earls clear 35m run line. Then, Carbery half-gap own, Earls straight send long, flat-ish-cum-forward pass wing, Jacob Stockdale, score. Carbery converted 12-0 15 minutes. Three minutes late missed MacGinty clearance saw O'Halloran run ball back, tackler slip Kieran Marmion Earls corner ease. Earlsy usually wants ball time, Schmidt said, but I think 20 minutes did want anymore, he'd run enough. The US try produced roar crowd 22,000. The Newcastle Falcons lock Nick Civetta scored it, charging clearance Carbery. MacGinty converted 17-7. In prompt response, Carbery kicked penalty corner Irish pack mauled hooker Niall Scannell throw big Devin Toner. So pros. Lamborn half-break could complete pass. From scrum, Ireland pressured tired No8 David Tameilau bound busy, came try game. Marmion scooted blind released Earls again, 70 metres later full-back Ben Cima got him, well, Earls popped pass tumble-dryer arms legs Marmion score. Carbery increased lead 29-7. So stayed half. The try second period took minutes, No8 Jack Conan touching five-metre scrum drive. Carbery converted. And second charge-down Irish No10, time Cork-born flanker John Quill. Carbery, Schmidt said grin, learn experience. The US best spell game, roar might home try shook stands  seconds so. Alas, replacement prop Paddy Ryan  Irish-born, employed Premiership Newcastle  threw forward long pass fine break wing Mike Te'o. Iosefo finish vain. Ryan Matyas 54 minutes Eagles' third, time patient phase play opening half-gap. Perhaps stung, little, Ireland brought Munster wing Simon Zebo, Lion Australia years ago. Although US scrambling defense good, Earls break substitute lock James Ryan replacement scrum-half Luke McGrath scored legs tired. The final try came high kick Stockdale wing, undersized Te'o predictably outjumped. Zebo collected loose ball score. On hot, sapping evening, teams earned applause.

Manchester United reached agreement sign Swedish international Victor Lindelof Benfica 30.7m (35m). With Champions League football secured Europa League added EFL Cup Community Shield triumphs, attention quickly turned reinforcements. The centre-back set Jos Mourinho signing summer United struck deal Portuguese champions. A statement Premier League club official website read: Manchester United pleased announce reached agreement Benfica transfer Victor Lindelof, subject medical examination, international clearance personal terms. A announcement transfer complete. In end, Harry Kane Gareth Southgate hoped might. This game gone, visitors apparently broken Leigh Griffiths' pair free-kicks, Raheem Sterling cut inside flung desperate cross left there, opening body mid-air meet delivery sweetly could, England captain guide home international goal 13 months. The manager leapt air, manic celebrations born relief delight. He pains point talent, eventually, out. There evidence Kane pedigree timing. Plucking point dregs furious contest left English buoyed, shortcomings team display Glasgow surely trouble Southgate summer. For Kane, plunder personal. This effect audition, fifth captain Southgate tenure date making influence felt just embarrassment  loss bitter rivals 17 years  beckoned. It ended special day, said. To 2-1 stoppage time nowhere, getting goal special. We gear, feels like good point. The dramatic nature equaliser effectively cleansed visitors' performance, exasperation 23-year-old forward endured appearance Southgate going exorcised last. That finish Kane inspiring team-mates captains should, scenario grimmest. The manager prefer contemplate armband permanent basis just yet, concentrating strengthening collective, just man. Last gasp contributions tend far-reaching effects. Kane, forward 75 Premier League goals past terms seven final outings season, expected prosper here. After all, Tottenham Hotspur striker himself confronted Christophe Berra, player contract Ipswich  mid-table Championship  expires end month summer return Hearts. Evade Berra Charlie Mulgrew, recently relegated League One Blackburn. Kane prospered better players year, ease impressive Kieran Tierney volley home reward. Yet said Scottish resilience contest actually drifted mid-way period second half glimpsed proper sight goal. Ryan Bertrand mustered centre exploit momentary hesitation, Scots apparently distracted substitution right, Craig Gordon react turn away Kane flashed header. That close came stoppage time, appeared Royal Marines, England saviours weekend infamous sheep dip Woodbury Common, spare ignominy defeat. Southgate delight point recognise plenty failings showing. For long periods painful reminder truism recent permanent England manager, bar Sam Allardyce, learned endure. The England team reconvenes summer, obviously tournaments, tends lack effervescence usually display autumn internationals, long slog Premier League campaign having dulled sparkle. There sloppiness possession, cross-field passes likely soar full-backs' heads ally. The attacking play prone overelaboration, slicker moves invariably running aground massed ranks rugged Scottish defence, Marcus Rashford instincts forever drift central areas England needed stretch opponents wide. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, eventually provide hustle bustle prise home apart minutes introduction, appeared natural fit role. This Southgate taste, senior manager, familiar issue. The Tottenham contingent, season extended competitions, taken post-season friendly Hong Kong domestic duties curtailed. Rashford, senior career infancy, known season first-team toil. Perhaps explained lack dynamism, hardly used excuse. The Scots, hefty Celtic contingent, hardly spent past months feet up. How arena rocked Griffiths threatened pilfer points death. The pained intake breath greeted Kane equaliser resignation. Even so, visitors' lack efficiency ball infuriated Southgate. It served heighten Kane anxiety goal drought level, stretching friendly win Turkey May, playing mind. The chances fell forward interval awkward, born Eric Dier lofted pass Kane shinning attempt high wide. There precision Bertrand exchange Adam Lallana moments later, Liverpool midfielder scuttling byline clip cross, captain heels collect cleanly. Fortunately England, moment come. This day I forget, added departing arena. The captain point. Chris Coleman wanted Wales focus future basking summer success, Sunday World Cup qualifier Serbia taking place exactly year opening match Euro 2016, manager concede impossible trip memory lane. That glorious, sun-drenched afternoon Bordeaux, Wales marked appearance major tournament 58 years dramatic 2-1 victory Slovakia, evokes happy thoughts Coleman, moment live took place pitch. When national anthem started, that I remember, Wales manager said. Two things stand out: respect showed Slovakia national anthem played  silent us, great; national anthem  noise, wow, unbelievable. That I remember. Of course I remember goals. But definitely, tournament, game, singing national anthem  good gets. Coleman love experience summer World Cup dream fading fast Wales come away Belgrade nothing. Trailing Serbia Republic Ireland points halfway stage qualification campaign, Wales ill afford lose ground suspended Gareth Bale Neil Taylor, Hal Robson-Kanu, James Collins Andy King. They remain unbeaten Group D, supporters little deflated draws matches, especially lead squandered games, pessimistic qualification chances result. Coleman picked shift mood home believes expectations changed reaching semi-finals Euro 2016. In campaign drew home Bosnia like we'd won. This campaign we drawn it like defeat what happened Bosnia game drawing Austria. What happened unprecedented, thought going dizzy heights. You Austria come point it disappointing result we qualified semi-final tournament. I ca say surprised I expected unless won game campaign top. It human nature far, expect bit want bit more. But ca look anybody else. It us. Everybody looks differently it tougher  we striving long position teams seriously expectation higher. The expectation higher reason  produced. With Coleman maintaining campaign manager prospect Wales qualifying Russia raised questions position decide stand sooner later, maybe Serbia match things badly. I do like talking past game, it served right past, Coleman said. But I mention [now] people think: If do right result performance, what future?' But there 12 points it second place we chasing, it doable, I got absolutely I got. Why would I? I optimistic getting result Serbia. We points games play. Are good win bounce? I do tell answer that. Whether it Serbia away, does matter. I know result we gone hard places it. There getting away fact Bale absence huge blow Robson-Kanu Ben Woodburn, young Liverpool forward, missing leaves Wales short attacking options Burnley striker Sam Vokes. Coleman, though, remains positive believes Wales enough touch right buttons again providing right frame mind. Hopefully we mental sharpness focus we lead hang out, that what missing campaign, said. We seen job 90 minutes. We got certain level just lacked bit concentration. That we got back. Serbia (probable) Stojkovic; Ivanovic, Obradovic, Nastasic; Rukavina, Matic, Milivojevic, Tosic; Kostic, Tadic; Mitrovic Wales (probable) Hennessey; Chester, Williams, Davies; Gunter, Allen, Ledley, Richards; Ramsey, Lawrence; Vokes Martin O'Neill warned Republic Ireland players backward step strive reach year World Cup knock main rivals, Austria, running. The teams face Dublin Sunday match pivotal importance Europe competitive groups. At halfway stage Ireland level points leaders, Serbia, points ahead Austria Wales. Having won 1-0 Vienna November, welcome Austrians knowing draw probably helpful visitors. But O'Neill does want thoughts infect minds players urged treat make-or-break battle like famous duel Italy Euro 2016, Robbie Brady goal earned passage 16. That night knew beginning could rely win game  focuses stops thinking negatively, said O'Neill. This big, big game Austria want positive. I do think gotten points board positive let fall shell. Injury deprives Ireland best players, Samus Coleman Shane Long, O'Neill grateful Jon Walters recovered knee problem threatened rule action too. The Stoke City striker says completely fine training pain days week expected start central role front, possibly captain. Walters folk hero Ireland recent years thanks full-blooded bravura O'Neill believes player particularly deserving place World Cup, having helped propel Ireland Euro 2016 miss team matches injury. Jon talisman European qualification picked injury competition started played little bits it nice board he terrific us, said O'Neill. He great warrior and, that, great ability helps immensely. While Walters certain start, O'Neill selection riddles solve. Most notably, manager tendency spring surprises lineups decide faith Darren Randolph goal 30-year-old lost starting place West Ham end Premier League season looked shaky week friendly win Uruguay. The alternative Sheffield Wednesday Keiren Westwood, featured competitive international years. O'Neill difficult choice make central defence, John O'Shea, Richard Keogh Shane Duffy vying slots. Additionally, question include experienced Glenn Whelan central midfield despite appeal dynamic duo consisting Harry Arter Jeff Hendrick. O'Neill decide deploy creative talents Wes Hoolahan start preserve 35-year-old introduction bench required. Those like relatively innocuous problems Austria beleaguered manager, Marcel Koller, shorn seven players match risks charge event defeat. Absences defence force Austria formation featuring three, offensive threat looks weakened loss suspended Stoke forward Marko Arnautovic injuries Sparta Prague striker Marko Janko RB Leipzig Marcel Sabitzer. Worryingly Koller, forced rely fourth-choice goalkeeper, Heinz Lindner, reputed vulnerable face robust forwards Walters. Republic Ireland (probable) Randolph; Christie, O'Shea, Duffy, Ward; Arter, Whelan; Brady, McClean, Hendrick; Walters Austria (probable) Lindner; Hinteregger, Prdl, Dragovic; Lazaro, Alaba, Junuzovic, Baumgartlinger, Klein; Burgstaller, Harnik Paris Tuesday final stop John Stones inaugural season expensive English defender history reunion Kylian Mbapp represent fitting end it. The campaign vindicated Manchester City, England international insists, regret Monaco forward denied Pep Guardiola: silverware fiercely scrutinised career. Very disappointed, Stones blunt assessment season Etihad Stadium. Purely great team set bar high. Disappointed personal note believe better games I better, I want improve future. On personal note unbelievable me. My journey start season end, I just changed completely player grown pitch well, I went do. Pep message improve day. That I went City I wanted work Pep  he got best players he worked won lot trophies. Ultimately, goal  good I win things I can. As kid I played tournaments team won trophies professional career I won yet. I hungry medal neck. The Champions League satisfy Stones appetite City exited 16 Monaco, Mbapp scored home away dominant performances Guardiola exposed defence. He clinical, recalls 23-year-old. He player making we looking stop him. If I pitch I definitely looking that. He new international game I lucky play games now. Stones struggles French teenager brought criticism City 47.5m acquisition Everton, staunch support Guardiola, claimed central defender more balls everybody Etihad press room 1-1 draw Liverpool followed. It definitely helped know he got it just him, it everybody club, says Stones, rejects suggestion English record price-tag burden. The money football nowadays frightening I thought I gone transfer like ultimately it player, says. It does really make harder. I fortunate bought money, flattered paying much, I want justice. An analysis Stones interview rarely passes reference playing style separates Barnsley academy graduate English norm attracted Guardiola arrival City summer. He debate tiresome? I do, no, defender says. You single-minded listen Pep staff want team. Football evolved teams playing way. I nice messages games players I have spoken before. I wo people drop it, I messages opposition strikers defenders saying respect love way I play, telling doing change way I am. To hear great given lot confidence. It classy touch well.

If know expect Lions play Dunedin Tuesday James Haskell. Five years ago living beachside suburb St Clair playing Highlanders personal odyssey involved stints France Japan.

The 32-year-old flanker thought treasured Lions dream evaporated, receive late month replacement injured Billy Vunipola. No visiting player keener Haskell revisits Forsyth Barr Stadium. Even remembers amazing experience genuine affection. It time life I look really fondly, Haskell said. I loved playing Super Rugby I really welcomed everyone. I threw myself culture going diving, fishing, shooting boxing I loved place. When I left I missed it. His dozen games Highlander jersey taught Kiwi rugby psyche Lions team-mates listen to. He suspects visiting players, example, underestimate all-consuming nature national sport. Everybody New Zealand wants All Black; just desire ball hand play touch early age, said. In UK rugby pecking order. Haskell reassured discover, so, New Zealand rugby players supermen; just play different type rugby. My experience Super 15 dispelled things I led believe media, TV watching highlight reels.  I think man we probably bigger guys athletically they different kind. In New Zealand there cab rank. Just think you seen best thing, there one. Super Rugby different league interesting happen teams Premiership. Kingsholm February rainy day mud, example, relegation involved. The Lions, way, fortnight finalise best way derail All Black machine Haskell believes solution secret. Against New Zealand super-disciplined, direct you doing. You play 80 minutes execute game. What rocket science: it executing speed, intensity accuracy. They consistently 80 minutes. Turn they got skill set punish you. Everyone knows it thing getting field delivering it. It containment. Dominating physically clearly prerequisite  You impose teams; I saying it go-to it certainly we trying do  Haskell, despite having staples inserted head caught team-mate elbow warm-up Lions debut Blues Wednesday, settle indefinite midweek role. The moment I got I wanted compete Test spot like everybody else. I just built sit coffees, I want push myself hard I can. If, furthermore, young players home wondering spell playing abroad worthwhile, Haskell advises pack bags immediately. I firm believer learn playing really testing yourself. If you sitting doing anything, plane ticket come play can. As career conclusively demonstrated, venture furthest comfort zone gain most. Full bursting kids England snatched remarkable wins Argentina try death Denny Solomona. One 10 debutants, Solomona combined brilliantly steal game twisted way certain, last, settled Argentina favour. It suitably stylish way round outrageously entertaining second halves recent times. A win team accomplished familiar Pumas represents quite statement England youngsters, marshalled superbly George Ford. The fly-half inconsistent he good pulling red Lions. I thought incredible game rugby, said Eddie Jones. In end I think 10 new caps poise stick needed circumstances unbelievable effort young guys. The match entertaining took reach real excellence. It came particular surprise Argentina quickest settle, props squeezing England youngsters win penalty scrum, Nicols Snchez just missed angled 50 yards. The hosts pinched England lineout, possession scored try, eighth minute: blindside, Snchez wicked chip sat nicely Emiliano Boffelli touch debut. Such madcap match back-row forwards, England flankers, Mark Wilson 18-year-old Tom Curry, excellent debuts, particular disrupting Argentina possession. But Ford proved master. The timing passes kept Pumas guessing and, best all, confident king tee, helping himself tally 23 points, including try own, conversion kick missed. His penalties drew England point, took lead half-hour. If Ellis Genge having rough time scrum, work loose excellent ever. He loose ball 22 away. Then debutant, Alex Lozowski, stretched Pumas superb run Ford fine cut-out let Marland Yarde loose tight-head prop. No contest. Argentina finished half stronger, scoring 10 points minutes break. Another loose England pass punished Jernimo la Fuente sparked passage brilliant interplay left, setting Toms Lavanini monstrous drive line Argentina second try. Snchez penalty stroke half-time earned Pumas 17-13 lead. In second half, though, teams sharpened act spectacular effect. England responded 10 points seven minutes lead again. Ford 42nd-minute penalty followed turn excellence Henry Slade, dummied clean Argentina midfield sent chip corner, Jonny May touched down. Ford converted touchline more. And Argentina took turn brilliant. Solomona came much-anticipated debut immediately himself middle whirlwind. Martn Landajo broke past Curry inside Solomona scrum set De la Fuente Argentina third, struck fourth best lot. Matas Orlando broke Solomona tackle deep half took ball deep England. Solomona managed back, turned inside Boffelli, sent Joaqun Tuculet line. The match turned final quarter. A remarkable 55-metre penalty angle Ford drew England five, England maestro closed deficit entirely try own. He combined superbly Piers Francis  making England outing, spell Super Rugby  streak clear cover England third. Remarkably, missed conversion: game tied. If deserved exquisitely poised final 15 minutes, this. First, England close game pressed Argentina 22. But people Dylan Hartley, skipper 85 caps, latest spill ball ferocious tackle, Argentina broke Orlando Ramiro Moyano, setting Juan Martn Hernndez coolest drop goals. Argentina game, surely  No. Up stepped Solomona, mundane defensive work. This time showed ball hand. Jack Maunder, debutant, combined Francis right set Solomona stepping, smashing streaking away Pumas defence steal extraordinary match death. We came win 2-0 that going do, said Jones, teeing week match Santa Fe. England inexperienced team then, remarkable win feel lot so. It probably shock new chapters extensive catalogue glorious Scottish sporting failures written 2017. How familiar was; painfully familiar. Cold analysis surround Scotland concession horrendous goals, kind undermine international campaigns cost managers job. The goals scored Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain Harry Kane horribly reminiscent type Scotland continually shipped recent times. Another blunt truth point England probably going use World Cup quest, Scots having trounced Slovakia failed beat Lithuania home. They need more, plus favours, campaign conclusion. Nonetheless, offering comment feels harsh. In glorious moments, Hampden rejoiced manner customary witnessed win France 2006. Before old failings returned, Scotland dared dream victory England 1985. That one, 60 years old, best result footballing career, said Gordon Strachan. You ca question personality character players. That duty times. They pushed level. He said draw felt like defeat. Strachan followed instinct three-man defence viable means halt powerful England four. That backline  Christophe Berra, Charlie Mulgrew Kieran Tierney  contained left-footed players. The Scotland starting XI featured seven. Good news future surrounds fact Tierney, full-back Celtic, finest Scottish prospects emerge years  prospect applicable, is. He endorsed rising status excellent display. If understandable Strachan express hope team make mockery 5-1 odds grounds talent disposal, harping 3-0 loss Wembley November little sense. The performance night gave lot optimistic about, said Strachan programme notes. We better team large periods match. If media indulged kind gross exaggeration routine, managers like Strachan plenty say it. The reality London Scotland efficient defence attack, leading match half hour play. England barely emerged gear canter victory. A glance Strachan pre-match comments necessary minutes. That get intae them' theory playing football gone, insisted manager. They control emotions. Strachan captain, Scott Brown, message. A reckless tackle Dele Alli 150 seconds played earned midfielder booking. This archetypal case playing gallery individual famed fine tackling. Brown later woefully lame Oxlade-Chamberlain breezed past en route opening scoring. And yet, Brown rush blood aside, Scotland opening impressive. They pressed harried visitors point England rattled 15 minutes. The problem Scottish energy reflected chances created. An attempt Lee Griffiths 18 yards, trouble Joe Hart, sum Scotland early play. Scotland problems soon resonated. Robert Snodgrass toiling badly, Stuart Armstrong failing impose himself proceedings James Morrison virtually invisible. Griffiths chronically isolated figure attack remainder half, Kane afforded England unassailable advantage. Perhaps having sensed England fragility, Scotland roused home crowd starting second period considerably composure confidence ended first. Griffiths later emphasised free-kicks worthy highest praise; running away celebration hit net. Strachan emotion soon different. He slammed water bottle ground disgust Kane finished post. A football nation, once, knew precisely felt. I tired think future, Strachan said. I just want home. Ben Stokes left Edgbaston praise captains ringing ears following destructive unbeaten 102 sees England head Champions Trophy semi-final Wednesday glowing confidence Australia plane home. Stokes, registering one-day hundred, continued rich run form carried time Indian Premier League. The Rising Pune Supergiants tournament expensive overseas player 1.7m deal national team captain, all-rounder priceless. His potential roof, said Eoin Morgan, 87 helped pile 159 Stokes fourth wicket. His batting exceptional. He calm crease, relaxed games he played really came fore. He outstanding. I think IPL auction proved [his value]. He looking influence game, bat, ball field.

We were able occasion. Morgan credited bowlers keeping Australia 277 nine, Mark Wood Adil Rashid picking wickets apiece. It given captain greater belief lifting trophy The Oval Sunday. He said: The games, we proved peg sides regardless they going 15 overs, probably years ago bit car crash us. So that huge improvement. And batting just thrive.

Gareth Southgate described Harry Kane 93rd-minute equaliser Scotland huge significant character England, believes propel team enormous journey needed deliver World Cup stage. England facing end 34-game unbeaten run international qualifiers defeat Hampden Park 1985 Kane, Southgate captain day, salvaged draw stoppage time. The substitute Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain given England lead stunning free-kicks final minutes normal time Leigh Griffiths transform contest. Gordon Strachan, under-pressure Scotland manager, said 2-2 draw felt like defeat probably emotional game managerial career. Victory revitalised country chances reaching Russia summer. Instead point leaves languishing fourth Group F matches play. England manager, contrast, accentuated positives late recovery claimed went way answering doubts national team character. He spared Joe Hart criticism Griffiths' free-kicks, beating England goalkeeper left, second right, claiming credit belonged Celtic striker executing outstanding finishes extreme pressure. It huge moment team, said Southgate Kane international goal year. The questions team centre character, centre ability withstand events you. That shown, team beat. The clock run stop.

We conversation week important. It fundamental team small step direction. We improve areas significant moment. Gary Neville, pundit duties Sky, faulted Hart positioning Griffiths free-kicks Manchester City keeper, spent season loan Torino appears destined leave Etihad Stadium summer, spared public condemnation manager. Southgate said: I need look again. They brilliant finishes. Firstly do concede free-kicks positions. I could understand free-kick [Scott] Brown escaped second yellow card.

To coming brilliant. To free-kick end game you tired Griffiths brilliant. They pushed level result country. With lunch approaching second day, Surrey appeared squandering extremely strong position built first. Their final wickets fallen 46 70 minutes bowled 399 and, Surrey bowling wayward batting witless, Essex ghosted 55 loss. We know Alastair Cook gorges short stuff Surrey attack, particularly Mark Footitt, spoiling him. But Sam Curran pinned Cook final ball session. Cook left looking perplexed, surprised receive ball challenged him. Surrey went spring step returned purpose, finding wickets, Footitt, swapping ends, producing beauty Tom Westley caught behind. Gareth Batty pinned Nick Browne Dan Lawrence cut straight point. Essex 134 four. All fine time Ryan Doeschate century season. This fine, brisk innings (his 26th first-class century) ground, short boundaries, fast outfield good track, mighty hard defend on. Ten Doeschate mighty hard defend against, too: tactically, best captain land,  case point  fights fires order, scoring round wicket, running brilliantly wickets (is better?) punishing remotely loose. There plenty punchy drives, beautiful pulled Ravi Rampaul way 120-ball century. The blemish came 39, dropped legside Ben Foakes Batty. He guided Essex 367 seven, 32 behind, shared 120 Ravi Bopara, looked fine touch, smashing Batty ground six, fooled nipbacker Stuart Meaker pinned lbw. Simon Harmer doughty ally fell fashion James Foster, caught Footitt. The day begun Surrey surprise subsidence bowled shy fifth batting point long certainty. They arrived optimism Curran maiden first-class century, double Mark Stoneman. Neither be. Curran 65 verve, chutzpah boundaries (48 came fours) ended Neil Wagner got stay just touch low, pinned front. Stoneman Batty saw 400, wickets fall seven. Stoneman fell driving Wagner caught diving Foster 197, career best. Stoneman, 617 runs Kumar Sangakkara Gary Ballance runscoring charts, obvious weakness. Given Haseeb Hameed struggles golden duck Canterbury Keaton Jennings, reached 50 10 Division Two innings, England selectors want note. From slip, Cook certainly good view prospective partner. With play possible Southport, Division One action enthralling low-scorer Taunton, Peter Handscomb half-century turned innings deficit 22 lead 105 stumps Yorkshire Somerset.

Missing players squad went France Gareth McAuley first-half injury, Michael O'Neill struggled Baku heat thankful profligacy Afran Ismayilov. The visitors secured unlikely victory Dallas rifled late winner, goal competitive international, having teed penalty area cool-headed Jonny Evans.

Fernando Alonso impressive run putting underpowered McLaren 12th. The word bedlam. It certainly difficult make sense extraordinary finale say that, ultimately, Harry Kane showed right end Gareth Southgate captain day. It 93rd minute Kane denied Scotland football, bloody hell moment and, process, feat escapology helped secure armband longer basis. That, however, tells story day sides experienced exhilarating joys excruciating disappointments football, space minutes. For Scotland, particular, agonising way finish wild eccentric encounter. Yet England frustrations bearing mind drifting relatively prosaic 1-0 win late drama Leigh Griffiths brought home crowd point rare euphoria. The free-kicks Griffiths expertly placed Joe Hart came 87th 90th minutes doubtful Hampden deafening roar second curled England net. Before game, Scottish FA announced competition greatest goal team history. Both free-kicks make shortlist stage Scotland verge inflicting England defeat qualifying fixture October 2009. Kane, though, ideas remarkably composed finish circumstances, ensuring Southgate team remain position strength Group F. Kane right-foot volley England get-out-of-jail card story changed again. Suddenly running corner celebrate and, pitch, Scotland players seen dropping knees. Their grief understandable time reflect disheartened when, context, Gordon Strachan starting lineup featured players teams begin season England second tier centre-half, Charlie Mulgrew, just relegated League One Blackburn Rovers. If imbalance talent, Scotland determined make ways. They quick ball, strong tackle accused lacking effort. They captain, Scott Brown, quickly gave impression England players encountered alongside Royal Marines weekend going chickenfeed compared 90 minutes company. Brown challenge Dele Alli  reducer, use old-fashioned parlance  earned yellow card inside opening minutes fortunate, extreme, stay hack player shortly Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, England substitutes, opened scoring. England taken settle cleared heads early uncertainty ball promising positions straightforward assignment that, perhaps, biggest disappointment Southgate. England supporters started going victory songs just Griffiths turned game upside down. Scotland compared, unfavourably, San Marino. Indeed, goal Griffiths took place Scotland staying home backdrop. Southgate exaggerating described a game control 80 minutes exasperation understandable and, wishing away Griffiths, moments bring scrutiny Hart performances. He goalkeeper Griffiths took advantage 25-yard effort corner another, similar distance, side. For Hart, satisfactory beaten distance twice quick succession. They were, according Strachan, best free-kicks remember years associated Scotland. From goalkeeper perspective, however, shot fully corner. Until moments Scotland little momentum final pitch Griffiths, playing lone striker, resorted penalty-area dive earlier second half. England difficult opposition defence Kane presentable chances, headed goalline Kieran Tierney, shot Jake Livermore came post deflecting striker. Oxlade-Chamberlain pitch minutes turned past Brown, moved penalty area, right left, opened scoring rising left-foot shot. England looked relatively untroubled foul Gary Cahill gave Griffiths opportunity aim. Strachan reflected never heard noise like it second went in, leaving verge noted wistfully best result managerial career. England, however, set rescuing competitive courage Southgate talked buildup match. It onslaught public announcer let knew minutes stoppage time and, finally, substitute Raheem Sterling picked Kane. England needed captain elegant finish given pressure moment consequences failed. This England dangerous play freedom, Australia discovered West Midlands Colosseum. And free game them. Unlike rest teams tournament assured semi-final slot start play, helped account flamboyant, carefree manner sent Australia packing. This outcome means Bangladesh contesting Edgbaston semi-final Thursday. Needing 278 win England propelled blistering partnership Eoin Morgan Ben Stokes. The margin victory dictated DLS method rain Birmingham. But proper result time, England winning 40 runs. They 240 9.4 overs remaining play suspended. On surface invited strokeplay, especially pace ball, pair packed house salivating singing: Cheerio, cheerio, cheerio, favourite rivals. Both left-handers sublime form. If Morgan Stokes, innings model powerful orthodoxy, gasping. Sometimes England captain shimmied pitch Australian pacemen crack ball covers. At stayed smash square. One sixes, instinctive swipe Josh Hazlewood, just kept going  defying wind longest boundary. The faster Pat Cummins tried bowl, ball travelled. The situation facing Morgan Stokes mirrored encountered Bangladesh Friday New Zealand Cardiff wickets fell early run chase. Such setback soon pinprick. There space Jason Roy innings full: straight-driven boundary ball; lbw Mitchell Starc second ball, proceedings delayed misguidedly sought review. His judgment awry well. So Roy conundrum continues. One suspects 1922 Committee got rid now. Alex Hales caught slip Hazlewood duck Joe Root edged keeper just interruption rain. It 35 briefly England relieved free game. However, transpired early wickets Australia, just insufficient New Zealand Bangladesh. When players returned Morgan unveiled sparkling cover drives Stokes soon stride. The boundaries reasonably big large contain Morgan form. He hit sixes dispatched chaotic run 159 added. Stokes spooned mid-on scampered run; Morgan watched ball partner Adam Zampa throw lit stumps. This best piece Australian fielding amid messy out-cricket, albeit gloaming late afternoon obviously tough pick white ball. Morgan departure great setback. Jos Buttler settled alarms Stokes hint serenity  let hope maturing fast  posted ODI century rain returned. By undercooked Aussie just accepted inevitable. The rustiness Australian team reflected inability make vigorous start batted. After 32 overs 181 target 300 horizon. But capitalise. At point lost wickets 15 runs space 26 balls Adil Rashid Mark Wood, took wickets them, chief tormentors. In end Australia reached 277 thanks sparky innings Travis Head, exasperated watch lower order come blink eye. That rustiness, consequence rain following Australia tread UK, appear hinder order much. David Warner struck crisp boundaries edged delivery Wood Jos Buttler. Aaron Finch silky eventually began connect ball no-nonsense style. He shared run-a-ball partnership Steve Smith lofting catch extra cover region Stokes, profligate days ball. Up went ball swirling wind stay long odds catch taken lengthen considerably. Morgan swivelled 360-degree arc, good sign, caught ball fumbling falling ground. No honest armchair critic era profess simple catch easily gobbled his/her day. Smith Moiss Henriques, looked devastating 15 minutes, fell straightforward catches Liam Plunkett. Then Glenn Maxwell fell regarded routine catch decade, old-timers gasping. A Maxwell hammer Wood headed Hollies Stand Roy came view; caught ball head, realised feet going cross boundary calmly tossed ball air returning field play catch it, run-of-the-mill moment brilliance era. From Australia subsided Rashid, excellent second game succession. Both Matthew Wade Starc embarked premeditated contortions make bowler job easier Head looked aghast non-striker end. It case Australia keeping Head losing theirs. Warriors forward Draymond Green secret feels Cleveland fans aftermath Warriors' 137-116 loss Game 4 NBA finals Friday Quicken Loans Arena. I do pay attention anybody Cleveland, honestly, said. They do sharpest people around.

But Green did leave court, referees said technical called Green foul 1:55 remaining quarter Kerr  official box score listed Green. No announcement correcting error, Green listening one. Kerr said thought technical called Green  said thought deserved  believed power forward going leave floor called quarter. But Green stood stoically floor, egged crowd raise decibel level jeers him. He said knew tech was him. I knew tech Steve, I did understand, Mike Callahan came John (Goble) asked tech said Kerr, Green said. So I knew I did technical foul, trying figure I second one. The box changed quarter indicate Kerr received technical. The officials acknowledged game handle situation well. Goble said thought verbalized table initial technical Kerr, said watching video better job that. The problem worsened officials did catch public address announcer saying called Green. The procedure advise table technical foul player number. With coach trainer, just verbalize time listen PA announcer on, Callahan said. At time, good job listening PA announcer hear announce it. I responsibility that. Late Game 4 year, Green swiped LeBron James' groin subsequently given flagrant foul. That gave accumulation flagrant foul points forced sit Game 5 Warriors lost chance clinch series, eventually fell seven games. So Friday bad night Warriors, head home good news. Thank God I play Game 5, Green said.

Rosewall, youngest French champion 18 1953 oldest 33, bought half dozen houses London winnings wanted  probably Wimbledon, All England Club matched French purse year social political turbulence, joining professional revolution sending definitive signal amateur sport changed ever. When Rafael Nadal reaches 10th Roland Garros title Sunday, Stan Wawrinka tries second, prize altogether stratospheric 2.1m, near 1.8m  time writing. Turbulence cyclical. If life simpler 1968, game too. Coaches arrived ground in. We used travel other, hit other, Laver said. That good coach. But Sunday final Court Philippe-Chatrier, resembling collision small armies, bit significant devoured equal enthusiasm. Tennis 60s played different rackets attitudes, perhaps, different constituency holding change. The Spaniard making history career, year completed La Dcima Monte Carlo Barcelona. Now, goes hat-trick 10s place matters  him, fans loyal devotees clay-court tennis. There minor rumblings red dirt Europe day swamped low maintenance hard courts  just treasured grass Wimbledon meant pressure, forced longer lead time preparatory tournaments sustain players  millions currency enough. The titles matter, though, Nadal desperate 15 majors absent Roger Federer. The Swiss cannily gave clay season swerve lightning start 2017 refreshed best Wimbledon, best chance adding collection majors. Clay graveyard Federer but, arrival Novak Djokovic make life uncomfortable Nadal, list. Not more. There possibility 36th birthday August play again, sponsors cringe disbelief say so. For now, stage belongs Nadal Wawrinka. Selecting winner straightforward, given Andy Murray stretched Wawrinka total court time tournament hours 34 minutes 15 hours 20 minutes brave doomed semi-final sets Friday. Nadal, meanwhile, sailed fortnight minute 10 hours. To past hours matches second semi-final Friday, crushed sixth seed, Dominic Thiem, 6-3, 6-4, 6-0. Murray avoided concluding bagel Wawrinka fought like starving dog final set stupendous hitting Switzerland highest ranked player. Nadal insists, conviction, that: I do care games I lost not, sets kind things. The thing I care I playing event I able win matches. That thing really matters. Tell Murray, operated considerably draining level admitted legs gone end Wawrinka. Quick wins matter seven, best-of-five matches  absurd suggest  advantage definitely Nadal.

The combatants 30-year-old Laver 34-year-old Rosewall. The younger man got revenge day. And younger man time, having lost Wawrinka previous slam final, 2014 Australian Open, probably likewise Sunday. There good good news British tennis Saturday. Ivan Lendl confirmed decided straight London prepare Murray Wimbledon defence return Florida. But Dan Evans retire calf injury leading Dustin Brown 6-3, 4-2 Aegon Trophy Surbiton. I do know [the extent injury] I scan Monday. Hopefully, it settled bit. Things like supposed happen. In just eighth grand slam event, unseeded, fearless Jelena Ostapenko produced stunning fightback win French Open title here.

Halep wonder failed clinch victory, having led set 3-0 having break-point chances long fourth game second set breaks up. The Romanian led 3-1 set but, truth, Saturday final hands Ostapenko, outrageous ball-striking sent ball flying past outstretched racket time time hopes grand slam title dashed dirt. It stunning victory woman went French Open world No47, 100-1 shot spoken contender. The junior Wimbledon champion years ago, Ostapenko round grand slam fortnight way played suggests years come. It fitting, sultry day Roland Garros, finish backhand return line, 54 clean winners struck final. I believe I Roland Garros champion I 20, said Ostapenko, showed nerves deviated simple, devastating gameplan attack, attack, attack. I know Simona great player playing great I kept trying, stayed aggressive I happy things turned me. I words, added. In absence Serena Williams, Maria Sharapova Victoria Azarenka, missing variety reasons, year French Open considered open time. Halep, people favourite winning Madrid reaching final Rome, expected able tame Ostapenko withstood early barrage groundstrokes Latvian set, 25-year-old track. Knowing Ostapenko capable reeling winners seemingly will, Halep aware needed stay patient, accept outhit wait mistakes, taking chance aggressive. She hoped Ostapenko freeze big occasion instead Latvian looked relatively relaxed. The simplicity game means does second-guess herself, proved beating players Sam Stosur Caroline Wozniacki en route. She come set times way final Halep failed break points 3-0 second set, hope.

The Irish back-row forwards Sean O'Brien Peter O'Mahony praised head coach, hailed impact bench replacements.

The Cleveland Cavaliers NBA current champion essentially team year title particularly cruel spend days home enduring debate Golden State Warriors greatest team ever. What happened Friday night Cleveland 137-116 Game 4 trampling Warriors should surprise. Did really think Golden State  good played  better Cavs? The Warriors game players, LeBron James best generation. And tried pretend late Friday night missed chatter Golden State historical brilliance, certainly picked carry grudge big arena Game 4. Some guys heard told wanted celebrate floor wanted spray champagne locker room, said James, specific details despite protests was listening talk Golden State dominance. He obvious culprit. I think came (Warriors forward) Draymond (Green), James added. The honest words uttered far finals came Cavs guard Kyrie Irving said: We everything, I sitting lying (if I said) did it. If truth today NBA players it read hear word said them. Players constantly griping seemingly innocuous lines weeks-old stories stray comments thrown radio shows. The idea slip cocoons, blacking media world swirling them, farce. What do computers glimpse television fed armada sycophants eager deliver news catch player attention. In words, Cavs  possess recent Larry O'Brien trophy  well-aware Warriors Showtime Lakers, Jordan Bulls 1960s Celtics one. They heard lot talk going lose finals games real championship contender years. When asked Warriors talk upset most, Irving said: All it. It game, I understand that, added. But knew faced with, that was. But add, course, chatter adds extra motivation. And day ready come - especially taste would lost tonight celebrated home floor. So I just leave that. The Warriors great team, probably best team league seen 20 years. They set NBA record regular-season wins year got better year adding Kevin Durant. Heading Friday night, stormed playoffs 15 straight victories, 30 wins 31 overall, plausible people wonder team 16-0 postseason. They certain win finals. While year team blew 3-1 lead Cavaliers similar situation (with games Oakland), fact Golden State won Wednesday Game 3 makes different. There big difference going 3-0 series Warriors year opposed losing Game 3 spring having fight 3-1. Golden State good lose straight Cleveland. The Cavs are strong defensively stop Warriors team. They weapons. But expectation Golden State going sweep Cleveland far-fetched. Remember, Warriors  dominance spring  25 points San Antonio Game 1 Western Conference finals came win Spurs star Kawhi Leonard knocked series sprained ankle. Golden State probably won series Leonard had hurt, grind. And would talk Warriors best team ever. A lot went Warriors Friday. The crowd extra loud, early fouls called Golden State players upset Cavs hit 53% three-point attempts. They feared lost Green Game 5 second straight year appeared draw second technical automatic ejection, officials later said given Green technical Friday Warriors coach Steve Kerr. A huge break Golden State. But Game 4 league current champion refusing cede historic greatness team beat spring. They aggressive, credit, said Green, nonetheless complained Warriors early foul trouble could aggressive wanted. There pride Cleveland. Still pretty, mightily effective Super Rugby unbeaten team year  Warren Gatland said: We needed that, did we? He repeatedly claimed Test series matters, palpable relief face criticism followed Blues defeat, feeling targeted match opportunity Lions announce arrival. Certainly far cohesive gameplan  aggressive, suffocating defence heart  far composed, finishing aside. Mako Vunipola apparent ambivalence haka summed Lions' refusal cowed. Conor Murray Owen Farrell dovetailed half-back Gatland coaches wished. Farrell scored points kicking hand superb. One effort stood particular, pegging Crusaders right corner, Murray equally effective boot. The Lions deep 22 stage second half box-kicks later  second beauty  Crusaders lineout near line. The All Blacks ruthlessly punish aimless kicking, powerful weapon Lions money. If man deserves plaudits Owen Farrell, dad, Andy, addressed squad Blues defeat lament ill-discipline. Against Crusaders, conceded seven penalties  compared 13 Wednesday  ferocious line speed ensured hosts ball wide hoped. Vunipola George Kruis excellent, but, importantly, pack, unit, defensively superb. On odd occasion Crusaders broke through, Lions scrambled well, set-piece largely number All Blacks forwards, struggle Mathieu Raynal officiating. It undoubtedly encouraging Lions created far opportunities previous matches, concern taking them; tries 240 minutes. Early on, Jonathan Davies chance George North clear right, Stuart Hogg released Liam Williams left. In second half, better pass impressive Ben Te'o Williams away left, CJ Stander knock-on Anthony Watson break horrible. Their opponents deserve plenty credit line defence, worked Crusaders, Lions  paraphrase Sean Connery  beat All Blacks bringing penalties try fight. Gatland lukewarm idea playing Jonathan Sexton Farrell together, Ireland fly-half finding best form bench, paired Maori All Blacks Saturday. With Te'o pitch, interchanging Farrell, robust midfield Lions benefited having playmakers. Indeed, ability adapt losing Davies Hogg half impressive, back-line ended match start Test. It bold start Watson full-back, Highlanders Tuesday make Test XV. For season, Dustin Johnson dominance Masters US Open looked like race second. If world No1 nonparticipation Augusta result freak domestic accident, recent returns 12th, 13th missed cut means suddenly Johnson does quite imperious. While understandably successful defence US Open Thursday prime motivation, leading lights afforded hope Erin Hills Wisconsin. In nod past champions, Johnson Jordan Spieth Martin Kaymer company rounds two. Unlike Johnson vast majority field, Spieth playing experience course  US Amateur Championship. I know it, said Johnson. Before I injured myself, I playing really well. Everything just really solid. But it getting I feel like I getting lot comfortable lot confident game. I feel like game, far year year, really different. Fascination surround Rory McIlroy fares course suit game returning enforced break recurrence rib problem. McIlroy precious players recent times destroy US Open venue  tends attritional major all. Erin Hills subject intense scrutiny, preside second major year. It new venue championship, need remarkable factor criticism Chambers Bay 2015, added rules fiasco overshadowed Johnson success year, means United States Golf Association need positive publicity. They taken criticism years, I sure they liking it, said Adam Scott, 2013 Masters champion. They going try run really good event. The ball court; control all. Hopefully, right time, just playability standpoint. Let just that challenge interesting, just playing brutal golf. The early indications particularly good; USGA published supposedly tournament draw includes batch to-be-decided player times. Phil Mickelson included despite saying attend daughter high school graduation San Diego Thursday lunchtime. Handily, Mickelson given afternoon slot round one; participation feasible event lengthy weather delay. Mike Davis, USGA executive director, denies widespread theory manufactured scoring high organisation agenda. We do talk it, said. What talk making sure adjust course to, say, there soft conditions; maybe tuck hole location little bit versus real firm conditions gets windy. We sitting talking saying tone thing down, slow greens, water them, case be. It really is score, it just setting course properly.

It rarely simple 19-year-old attempting break Stamford Bridge Solanke hardly seek alternative path. Liverpool fresh start with, plan, clearer route make lost time. Give finer details, Solanke depressingly familiar situation English players similar age. Perhaps change Under-20s win final tournament sense current crop momentum previous generations hard muster. We knew we got winning bunch players we got repeat that, Solanke said 3-1 semi-final win Italy, referencing Uefa Under-17 Championship title core squad won 2014. Solanke scored England goal final Holland, decided penalties; appears flash pan players return pre-season clubs  bar flight  scrutiny use treatment expected intensify. The cautious conclusion Solanke case that, England win trophy regardless scores goals certainly win golden boot award outright, tools place Premier League. He won admiration seen work close  particularly Under-20s manager, Paul Simpson  way handled exile Chelsea grown World Cup after, understandably, looking shade best games. Style wise, Solanke rangy figure who, appearing awkward, strength awareness threaten playing defenders deeper areas. He needs playing regularly high level now; so, too, team-mates Everton forward Ademola Lookman Bournemouth midfielder Lewis Cook. If lack success high-pressure situations contributed English clubs' caution using young players, unprecedented victory summer bring change mindset? Venezuela need negotiated that, despite country lack presence power senior level, far assured. England benefit freshness opponents required extra-time win knock-out games, wary forward Adalberto Pearanda  Watford books trodden familiar-looking path spells Granada Udinese  Sergio Crdova, four-goal tally equals Solanke.

If England do, centre-forward consider months sidelines eventually worth it. Chelsea, hand, feel precisely opposite true them. Every successful Lions tour needs rallying remember Christchurch mantra 2017 expedition. New Zealanders, least, readjust opinion supposed lightweights midst. The Lions gave easily best performance far, brushing aside disruptive backline injuries local scepticism confound felt win fixture trip. More that, breathed fresh life Lions enterprise, struggled escape litany gloomy provincial defeats. Their collective intensity controlled physicality right needed victory margin considerably wider. Four penalties Owen Farrell ultimately proved sufficient try-less contest forwards laid foundations. Against opposing pack containing All Blacks, discernible edge lacking initial matches Whangarei Auckland. Maybe emerged Tests regardless Lions management first-hand evidence New Zealand leading provincial side, Super Rugby standings averaging 37 points game, attacking brilliance squeezed them. Here, broadly speaking, surely blueprint All Blacks upset. Had Lions lost Stuart Hogg Jonathan Davies head injuries inside half-hour let potential try-scoring chances slip away convincing. As Farrell Conor Murray exerted impressive tactical control pack showed signs living advertised potential. George Kruis, Jamie George, Mako Vunipola, Peter O'Mahony Sean O'Brien feature everyone starting Test XV tour started, Tadhg Furlong, Alun Wyn Jones Taulupe Faletau enhanced reputations parts. It cracking encounter start finish, sides fully committed pumped cold evening. Two Farrell penalties gave Lions early advantage biggest early concern stray elbow excellent Murray inadvertently struck full-back forced bloodied Hogg field. The Lions' backline resources stretched Davies led away head injury assessment request medical staff. Jonathan Sexton came 10, Farrell switched 12 Watson came full-back, illustration Lions' range options versatility Warren Gatland deliberately opted for. Luckily forwards bit teeth home side, helped slightly slippery, dew-laden ball, initially struggling claim restarts losing lineouts. The Lions joy scrums all-international row, aside backpedalling loss control resulted mass scuffle penalty Crusaders, won 17 games year. For brief moment, Murray burst away upfield French referee, Mathieu Raynal, playing advantage, Lions looking hefty interval advantage attempted pass floor Jones lurking Crusader instead team-mates. The visitors slightly fortunate concede just points resultant intense period pressure close line. Their 9-3 half-time advantage, however, thoroughly merited extended Farrell awarded 40-metre penalty felt sailed ruled referee assistants. The Lions wasted points-scoring opportunity poor right left pass Ben Te'o life unnecessarily hard Liam Williams outside him. CJ Stander spilt glorious chance Watson broken clear split defence wide open. In final analysis mattered not, fourth Farrell penalty 70th minute giving New Zealanders food thought Test Eden Park fortnight away. What contest All Blacks hassled harried defensively, given scant time think repeatedly turned pinpoint kicking Murray Farrell. Despite having operated tandem training, Sexton-Farrell axis 10 12 went reasonably dispelling sense Gatland opt bigger ball-carrier inside centre.

It taken time reach stage finally England got point manager national team entire press conference single question Wayne Rooney, captain. Seven months Southgate era new team taking shape minus chap 119 caps 53 goals country. England, Southgate said, need different leaders now, going great efforts alienate Rooney completely naming permanent captain. Not yet, anyway. For time Harry Kane leading team Hampden Park England Scotland lock horns World Cup qualifying group. Jordan Henderson, Gary Cahill Joe Hart previously worn armband new manager and, point, Southgate going selfish discount Rooney feelings decide candidates deserves role full-time basis. Equally difficult Southgate trying achieve allegation England comes crunch lack genuine leadership players cope pressure dangerously close intolerable. Or Steve Holland, England assistant manager, noted earlier week summer Iceland debacle: Maybe stadium, watching holiday like me, looking round players thinking: Bloody hell, they gone. Where leaders? Where leadership?' That pressure moment, stepping forward? It looked like nobody. Kane, ironically, players crumbled, booed team supporters warranting L'Equipe ratings day. One bad night, however, held forever, especially just won Premier League golden boot, Southgate probably criticised devoting attention mission developing leaders group, emphasis plural. That process took overnight trip Woodbury Common weekend players began preparations Scotland game mucking Royal Marines. Team-bonding, it, Southgate reminded that, Clive Woodward England rugby team, senior training instructors subsequently gave list names men would battle with. The feedback Southgate quite brutal  there said should journey us, clarified  comes Kane clear sense manager sees kind player drives ability. His goals record seasons speaks itself.

Plus Kane reminder, week England reached final Under-20s' World Cup, England capable bringing elite footballers. Everybody knocks youth development, Southgate said.

The chair magistrates, Lillian Molloy, informed Ormond, bail conditions, appear 7 July Newcastle crown court. In 1939 Football League wearing numbers backs shirts mandatory, 1951 officially allowed footballs, previously shade mud brown given state pitches time extremely unhelpful, white. These novelties stand steps football long journey modernity superficially little common, separated 12 years world war. In fact, however, introduced single pioneering week pre-season 1927, time wild experimentation appears gone forgotten unnoticed game histories timelines. Herbert Chapman, won leagues titles FA Cup Huddersfield Town course repeat feat Arsenal, credited playing decisive role both. In fact supportive tangentially involved, credit player numbers rationally belonging Chelsea manager, David Calderhead, chairman, Claude Kirby, later Everton William Cuff, white ball certain Mr EL Roberts Kingsland, Shrewsbury. At end July 1927 Roberts, humble reader, wrote Athletic News draw attention Football Association lovers game desirability changing colour football, I doubt meet universal approval. A white ball, suggested, visible inherently exciting. The attraction white globe travelling low high, suggested, with twists turns increasing excitement goes goal. Ivan Sharpe, Derby County, Leeds United Watford member Britain gold medal-winning football team 1912 Olympics, editing paper time. So taken idea edition published letter full, editorial page. A ball white leather  advantages spectators players, read. On sunny days players probably difficult ball used, bright days English winter, modern summer, comparatively few, gained lost. In murky weather characteristic football season probable white ball welcome innovation spectators. The idea fanciful, worthy thought. This Chapman came in. He, managers, sufficiently intrigued test white balls pre-season friendlies summer. We realise possibilities suggestion appearing Athletic News, said, and intend explore fully possible. He did, however, admit I doubt league matches. It certainly novel suggestion, said FA secretary, Frederick Wall, challenged declare illegal. There laws game prevent white ball used, practice game I personally objection. It was completely novel idea. There records white-painted balls used games dating end 19th century, occasional use continent. Derby come pre-season tour Netherlands 1925: dusk fell game Ajax, making brown ball hard make out, white replacement thrown field. The tourists kicked again, refusing play a lump whitewash. This time, however, English game little receptive. Only, however, little. Reading try it, particularly impressed. The referee, JV Pennington, said it difficult express definite opinion trial I satisfied severely handicap goalkeeper bright day and, puzzlingly, a ball painted white dangerous players heading it. The Reading captain, Robert Eggo, sniffed: I white ball advantage, bright sunny day easily prove distinct disadvantage. Their manager, Andrew Wylie, declared idea a piece nonsense  fad. The Guardian reported trials weekend, Clapton Orient was distinct disappointment, players complaining finding difficulty sighting grey weather, Huddersfield white paint swiftly rubbed ball, assumed ordinary hue long end, Blackpool players were emphatic expressing dislike innovation. Arsenal played half game ball covered shiny, enamel paint  stuff applied golf balls  second half matt finish. The Athletic News' correspondent noticed particularly ball showed dark background spectators standing popular terracing, declared it obvious really dull day white ball enormous advantage spectators' point view. Those actually field, however, overwhelmed. The referee, WT Guttridge, described one occasion I entirely lost ball flashed white crossbar, complained I difficult follow travelled level players' white knickers. Billy Blyth, Arsenal captain, said enamelled ball all players agree impossible control, slithering toe angles. So far visibility concerned, ball splendidly ground, strain following flight height. We experiment experiment, going it, declared Chapman. I far say unsatisfactory, successful justify departure tradition. The league season kicked balls unchanged that, seemed, that. The probabilities heard white football, read editorial Burnley News. A proposal origin craze novelty, required light actual experience demonstrate futility. On Saturday white ball used grounds, cases experiment said complete failure. The experiment met chorus condemnation, granted white ball kicked time. Calderhead white ball vocal critics, concentrating alternative innovations, Chelsea preparing experiment time use numbered jerseys trial match following Monday. Though witnessed couple amateur internationals club level true first, Calderhead declared certainly helpful, particularly spectator point view said not certain worth putting Football Association council. This hostile reception. Sidney King, manager West Ham United, said numbers players look like horses jockeys, Tottenham Hotspur Billy Minter said in long experience football, I crowd able pick man glance programme. Walter Hart, Birmingham president, declared hideous Wall, behalf FA, declared idea very undesirable unnecessary. Chapman, good friend Calderhead, lone supportive voice. I do idea useful, said, the innovation hardly necessary. A year later Chelsea Arsenal wore numbers league games season. That day great football writer James Catton wrote article support novelty. The objects club play game greatest possible pleasure throng seats terraces, wrote. It difficult understand clubs strongly objecting proposed change great help everybody occasions. The convenience public paramount. Not likely. Though Chelsea surveyed 700 fans game received unanimous support numbering, Guardian reported the spectators approved practice general years ago the personality scoring forward crush' goal revealed shape back, League immediately banned them. Chelsea, though, up, 1929 wore numbers tour Brazil, earning nickname Los Numerados. I numbering players I hope agreed annual League meeting, chairman, Claude Kirby, said 1928. League football new powerful rivals contend with, afford miss opportunity popularising it. I convinced thousands casual spectators regular followers easy means identifying players. His fellow chairmen unmoved, idea went away. There support FA, honorary treasurer, Arthur Kingscott, seen numbers use acting tour manager trip Canada 1926 returned declare at I like idea in end I came conclusion excellent idea, enabled crowd follow closely movement player. In January 1933 Tottenham allowed wear numbers FA Cup third-round match Watford, won 7-1, March worn trial match England second XIs Fratton Park, leading larger versions used FA Cup final following month Everton, wore 1-11 starting goalkeeper No1 ending outside-left, Manchester City, took 12-22 starting outside-left ending goalkeeper, Len Langford, No22. The idea debated rejected Football League later year (What advantage hard conceive, sniffed Times) time numbers seen Wembley 1939 (It makes game easier follow wonders players League matches allowed numbered, enthused Times), couple months league finally compulsory, motion proposed Everton chairman, new league president long-term numbering advocate, William Cuff, carried 24-20. White balls turn, wait while. The late 1940s saw colour-based oddities, winter 1946-47, snowiest 20th century, prompting Southend paint touchlines red Reading turn goalposts blue, soon alternatives brown leather balls considered again. Of particular importance white ball road acceptance televised match England Italy White Hart Lane 1949 white ball used fading light end insistence Fifa president, Sir Stanley Rous, felt against background high stands White Hart Lane ordinary ball invisible air night falling. After game league secretary, F Howarth, sniffed I think ball offered advantages ordinary one, received watching public FA resolved experimenting: February 1950 England B played Switzerland B Hillsborough bright yellow ball used half, garish orange second. The big push came following year, top-level competitive floodlit football. It lights white ball really, sense, shone. In 1951 League permitted use, introduction haphazard. Initially games started, according tradition, brown ball, white brought got bit gloomy  Guardian described stages Chelsea game year like watching ping-pong ball bobbing darkened room. But catch. Back 1927 ball manufacturer quoted saying was, opinion, practically impossible make white football. By 1951 solution found, involved different tanning process, application layer white paint, layer cellulose. The layer ball white, second protected damage. It also, quite accidentally, protected ball water: traditional versions increase weight 20% wet day, white ones remained impervious. It discovery change game. It certainly changed games. In 1951, example, amateur international England Wales tied 1-1 15 minutes play teams battling hoof sodden leather ball muddy pitch, white ball called for. England duly skipped 4-1 victory. In 1952 Sunderland Echo asserted ball particularly helped players smaller build favouring short-passing game. Big players given advantage mud declare compensates start finish season conditions favour smaller men, wrote. They insist light ball, used counter mud, penalises them. In 1953 FA recommended white balls used start all, remained referee discretion. That November, Hungary showed quite assisted technical players white ball England net times Wembley. The greatest possible advert use came arrival Hungarian team following year, surely rank important friendlies history game, probably No1. The match Wolverhampton Wanderers Honved inspire L'quipe propose European Cup, started 1955, eight-year-old George Best Wolves fan, estimated 12 million people watched BBC broadcast second half, rare glimpse televised football FA Cup final occasional internationals. With team 2-0 interval Wolves manager, Stan Cullis, sent groundsmen apprentices (including 15-year-old Ron Atkinson) half-time drench pitch water, resulting bog frustrating swift-passing Hungarians utilised direct tactics battle thrilling, dramatic 3-2 victory. The 1958 World Cup utilise white ball, battle effectively over, sympathies supporters crystal clear years later later stages Burnley title-clinching 2-1 win Manchester City Maine Road soundtracked sides' fans singing white ball, white ball strained track brown one. Back 1927, outspoken readable Derby Telegraph columnist bylined An Outside Right took aim footballing novelties. I large army football enthusiasts regard attempt introduce innovations white balls identity numbers players mere vapourings people happy unless given novel. There wrong game. Let it. Players ought numbered, they? Here proposition forward who, like sponsor white ball idea, ought optician, wishes evade expense football helping out. The great objection players numbered spectators superficial, intelligent, game. Under existing conditions spectators exert powers observation intelligence order follow correctly play players. Make [too] easy fun it. Man hunter; half fun actual hunt. I makes football easy spectacle watch follow. Football soon dogs football administrators ear faddists. Over 90 years words written football administrators have just given ear faddists eyes, nose mouth well. Heaven knows modern game, Outside Right surely admit got wrong. Mark Sampson says believes the team home England Women begin monthlong training camp European Championship summer. With hopes high England third-place finish 2015 World Cup Canada, Sampson says players staff focused the best planet discussed outcome winning trophy. Speaking preparations include friendlies, Saturday away Switzerland, warm-weather training camp Spain, Sampson said: I think key quality tournament togetherness. The team definitely team home. We working hard training pitch make sure we fit, make sure understand we trying make sure opponent throws we got relevant weapons way win. Refusing home, way win, staying together. I believe team ability best world, 100%. There mind final whistle [World Cup] semi-final we going win event. I discussed players getting group, getting stage whatever. It winning. That guarantee we win.  course it not. We lose eliminated. But focus completely doing best possible chance win event. Sampson earned criticism inside women game named 23-strong squad months tournament Spring Series, climactic event reshaped Women Super League. Yet England manager defended decision said announcement necessary squad preparation. I got huge credit players, said. They aware announcement confirmed places squad early I think work incredibly diligent professional. I really impressed level performance [in Spring Series] I impressed work away field. This intention, work scenes makes big difference you cameras. We said need rip right good Spring Series. We said compete, tackle, fight, push other. I think arrive right balance toughness freshness. England planning stay end tournament hosted Netherlands begins 16 July. We looking we away 5 June 7 August really long time, Sampson said. So try good balance switch on. When switch team demand highest standards, work ethic, competitiveness, learning  key qualities best planet. But switch want fun, want enjoy we got great balance, I think. I excited programme we got, like it great paper, it people make come alive. That staff, that players, make come alive make best possible preparation camp they had. A New Zealand official says Warren Gatland potential candidates succeed Steve Hansen All Blacks' head coach, particularly British & Irish Lions achieve stunning series win. New Zealand Rugby chief executive, Steve Tew, said visitors remain threat Test matches and, lose heavily, future Lions tours endangered. The experienced Tew, spell helm NZR coincided All Blacks winning back-to-back World Cups, acknowledged assistant, Ian Foster, pole position Hansen confirm intention step 2019 tournament Japan. If New Zealand suffer unscheduled wobble, however, Tew anticipates Gatland entering frame. Ian Foster sitting strong candidate Steve does finish there others, said Tew, suggesting overseas-based Gatland, Joe Schmidt Vern Cotter potential alternatives. Joe sitting Ireland we'd like back. Vern coaching high level would rule Gatty either. Asked Gatland stock rise appreciably Lions won Test series, Tew replied: You ask Warren wants next. We do know Steve doing manage transition well. We sitting later year work process. The notion Gatland taking Hansen sound improbable New Zealand considerable respect successful stints charge Wales, Wasps 2013 Lions Australia. I view good Lions team they tough Test series, said Tew. I think physical attrition series going toll. One team come better other. The commercial benefits New Zealand Rugby staging Lions tour similarly striking and, unsurprisingly, Tew wants country host 2029. It unique that worth preserving. The current contract Lions Sanzar (South African, New Zealand Australian Rugby) runs tournament needs renegotiated commitment Lions locked calendar. More contentiously dismissed switching 16-year cycle allow Argentina, Rugby Championship, host Lions 2033 earliest. We currently anticipating Argentina coming there history touring countries. World Rugby vice-chairman, Agustn Pichot, feels otherwise, possibility arranging early tour games North America clearly option, leading southern hemisphere unions are, varying degrees, kept financially afloat Lions. In 16 years time change I think you'd struggle run Lions tour meaningful schedule Argentina, said Tew. There doubt good friend Mr Pichot eyes Lions I do think involve turning 16-year cycle. That radar. Nor, predictably, backing Super Rugby franchise Pacific Islands  In immediate future I ca sustain professional team Pacific Island unless, financially, there significant private intervention  recently past week Tew discussions South African officials rugby future viability southern hemisphere. It simple saying [South Africa] want leave Sanzar. I asked question week. The complication southern hemisphere live far apart. It enormous cost. One things we learnt [from Super Rugby] careful expansion. The Aussies, South Africans degree Japanese learning hard way. Tew reaffirmed All Blacks continue play financial hardball comes negotiating deals play Tests northern hemisphere. Despite having agreed play England tour autumn, discussions RFU chief executive, Ian Ritchie, proved informative. We know play Twickenham ratchet turnstiles up. Ian I good commercial conversation I got good idea real number looks like. We certainly conversation fee higher we'd before. That sit time come discuss it. One great contrasts Olympic Games bring best athletes, bring worst host cities. This past week offered sharp reminder dynamic, fresh revelations National Security Agency engaged indiscriminate surveillance 2002 Winter Olympics Salt Lake City. This mere quirk history. The Olympics-induced state exception long afforded government authorities enormous leeway break norms bend laws. If, appears likely, Paris Los Angeles awarded 2024 2028 Games respectively, cities bear mind events Salt Lake City sleepwalk optimistic rhythms IOC. It time face past make big asks future. The NSA, according executive whistleblower Thomas Drake, merely scooping metadata Salt Lake City Games, alarming be. Drake said warrantless dragnet: Virtually electronic communication signals went designated areas captured stored NSA, including contents emails text messages. Drake input lawsuit brought 2015 Salt Lake City mayor Rocky Anderson alleging overreaching mass surveillance program vacuumed data millions innocent people. Drake disclosure adds NSA contractor Edward Snowden revealed 2013, according government documents, NSA met higher-ups COMPANY E ahead Games. As President Surveillance Program, NSA asked COMPANY E provide records support security 2002 Olympics Salt Lake City. The CEO COMPANY E, turned Denver-based Qwest, fully cooperated. Another document Snowden surveillance archive makes clear Salt Lake City one-off: NSA active role Olympics 1984 Los Angeles games, seen involvement increase recent games Atlanta, Sydney, Salt Lake City. The lesson everyday people aspiring host cities threefold. First, governments perfectly willing use Games test-drive new methods technologies, publicly denying while. Second, private companies willing ride. Finally, truth years unearth. Since 2002 Salt Lake City Games  time US hosted Olympics  country cartwheeled forward intensified surveillance measures. This fuel public concern Los Angeles. But group raising issue NOlympics LA, led activists Democratic Socialists America coalition allies. The LA bidding team simply avoids subject. The truth Olympics inflection point. The promise memorable athletic performances longer enough. The terrain Games shifted mightily decade, activists, academics, elected officials asking tough questions bid process, kneecapping bids data cases torpedoing public referenda. Exhibit A Boston activists vociferously opposed Games mayor refused sign dotted line cost overruns, killing bid. The 2024 Olympics field originally featured full-fledged candidates public pressure derailed bids Hamburg, Rome, Budapest, leaving Los Angeles Paris. For long IOC response criticism ladle fat dollops slapdashery. It starts IOC president, Thomas Bach. The Rio 2016 Olympics left herd white-elephant venues crumbling disrepair, disgruntled residents homes demolished Games, broken legacy promises, notably related water cleanup. Former Rio mayor Eduardo Paes, Games' biggest boosters, accused accepting nearly $5m shepherding Olympic contracts particular palms. Yet, wake Games, Bach proclaimed Rio Olympics marvelous heralded tremendous legacy people Rio Janeiro, Brazil South America. He claimed straight face Rio, the financial model Olympic Games really stood stress test. Fast forward today. In Los Angeles Paris, IOC relatively strong bids. Bach recently said this position like in. But Bach stiff-lipped insistence, smartest people IOC know number aspiring host cities dwindling Olympics crisis. Even Economist, house journal corporate capitalism, admitted current dearth prospective hosts indicates the business model Olympic Games running puff. According media reports, LA engaged backroom badinage IOC squeeze concessions, including financial aid run organizing committee additional years. Last week, LA mayor Eric Garcetti suggested IOC help finance metropolitan youth sports programs. If best concessions Los Angeles bid jockeys wrest IOC, need work game. This historic opportunity extract fat satchels cash IOC (and group plenty spare) benefit everyday Angelenos. After all, LA people living poverty major US city highest number chronically homeless people country. Last year, LA officer-involved killings US. The Los Angeles County Jail biggest country, plagued inmate abuse issues. Los Angeles need squander unique moment. Time think big. The Olympics come baggage, it blanket surveillance, public debt, aggressive marginalization marginalized. LA bidders rare chance push back. Apparently Liverpool going plugging away transfer negotiation lark crack land full-scale ban.

Pittsburgh chance franchise 19 years win Cups series shifts Nashville Game 6 Sunday night. Understand we going play desperate team, said Penguins captain Sidney Crosby collecting assists.

If Hexagonal group team capable exposing vulnerabilities Americans' line midfield Denver suburbs Thursday, Mexico US home Sunday? A draw Mexico impressive result US conceivable context; evidence, that surely right attitude fixture. No reason hopes set high. Christian Pulisic hero - sentence likely well-worn sentiment months years ahead. Ruthless alert, 18-year-old scored twice provided coolness goal experienced team-mates lacked. He having fun, Bruce Arena said, calling an exceptional talent. He added: I just think he natural game, sees game good instincts getting good spots, especially running ball exceptional. Arena said felt frustrated half time lack sharpness ends, overall pronounced himself content. We played solid 90 minutes, said. We started 2017 pretty good shape I pleased time. Dennis Lawrence, T&T head coach, felt charges unfortunate. Individual errors probably cost us, said. I felt all-in-all boys probably did deserve that.

Three points T&T virtually essential  lessen risk missing spots facing playoff Asian side, avoid struck self-doubt ahead toughest fixture campaign. With injury problems worry about, Arena picked looked like strong solid, low-risk line-up.

After 25 minutes, Brooks tested Jan-Michael Williams distance, T&T goalkeeper called seconds later deny Altidore. Pulisic ran left lashed over. Amid American pressure visitors enjoyed surprising room left wing, fashioned little close Tim Howard net. Until 32nd minute, is, Kenwyne Jones squandered outstanding chance head visitors lead. With Howard flailing, Atlanta United Sunderland striker  MLS-attached players T&T starting XI  nodded ball bar. Though Williams make saves half, sides level break.

There moments pitch  Iceland game everyone point reference  react, you looks fine, suddenly bang, bang', it 1-2. The feedback Gareth that, cases, team identity' lacking Maybe stadium, watching holiday like me, looking round players thinking: Bloody hell, they gone. Where leaders? Where leadership?' That pressure moment, stepping forward? It looked like nobody. Does weekend solve that? Not hit, no. But having identified it, process hopefully, short term long term, create different mindset group help us. It simple that. The exorcism nightmare French Riviera continuing. Scotland test England progress ferocious din Hampden Park Saturday, group leaders charged imposing hosts. Coping level expectation process. Roy Hodgson supposed ease Iceland, all, ahead early on. Southgate staff recognised young group potential realised hurdles vaulted ease. There potential, yes, clearly work group maximum is, said Holland. If hit team chance win [tournaments]. I doubt, team chance win. Since coming in, Gareth interactive way dealt players happened summer: asking think, necessarily telling thinks. It driven really ownership players. What recognise?

What obvious conversation Ivan Lendl hard-nosed approach physical demands sport perfect antidote occasionally downbeat world view Andy Murray. It working athlete natural inclination seek comfort hardship. If easy, goes thinking, doing it; not, best survive prosper. A word recurs Murray interview tough.

You going ill injured again, start again. It difficult mentally player. It nice Andy healthy practices  I think results starting come. I injuries ill wrong time year I needed training block. It happens. With exception days, bit flu, putting great work. He scraped matches work started come in. Murray complained past four-month gap slams season affect player motivation. Lendl demurs. Of course, focus slams but, order play slams, confidence. You confidence winning. You winning consistent work. So kind feeding that. I do think he low physically. He pretty strong there. He does feel tired day. You do lose conditioning two- threeday flu. If you bed weeks, lose conditioning. You just shake flu rebound quickly level before. I concerned that.

The Serb, won slam beating Murray year final here, slipped ranking points, left tournament dispirited puzzled.

He public power outage worst possible moment losing tight set  chances left repair damage. When Murray asked turned tennis fortnight early exits leadup clay tournaments year, said: I doing lot basic drills, lot patterns play just literally repeating those. Pretty boring. It fun. But, I getting longer rallies now, I feel like I autopilot. He afford crash like Djokovic did. He fit Friday hold bay opponent regarded naturally strongest player tour, spent just 1hr 40min getting rid Marin Cilic. Wawrinka drop set; Murray given fought tie-breaks.

[On Wednesday] extremely difficult wind [at start match]. Ball-striking hard Kei hit ball incredibly set. But left him. He pushing Andy conditions Andy could timing [right]. Then Kei could timing conditions. If Murray wins, plays Thiem Rafael Nadal, meet second semi-final. And probably slugging match. Of men left, young Austrian hits forehand venom, 84mph, followed Wawrinka (81mph), Nadal (79mph) Murray (73mph). As comparison, Latvian Thursday reached women final, Jelena Ostapenko, averaging 76mph forehand. If Murray gets final second year row, significantly deficit power ground, plays.

It years Ostapenko won junior Wimbledon title, taken time mature, better known feisty attitude results. Until fortnight, past round grand slam win Tour title. Now great day away winning grand slam crown. With fearlessness young players truly show, Ostapenko bashed winner winner defeat Bacsinszky 2hr 24min.

The striker suggested relationship Conte has bad season relaying text exchange pair. I going honest, day Conte sent message saying does count season, Costa said mixed zone, so I way out. The fact striker clear told leave appear undermine Chelsea bargaining position possible buyers. Costa pursue payment loyalty bonus sold given formally asked transfer told club actively looking on.

The Premier League winners retain Southampton Virgil van Dijk, longer immediate consideration Liverpool, seek purchase back-up goalkeeper replace Asmir Begovic. Transfers Peter Moore remit Liverpool new chief executive club alleged tapping Virgil van Dijk predated official start date job, Premier League meeting Harrogate Thursday awkward regardless. Southampton member club regard emissary Fenway Sports Group scepticism suspicion. Liverpool owners, including John W Henry chairman, Tom Werner, heavily involved damaging decision withdraw publicly Van Dijk Wednesday, 24 hours Southampton complained Premier League clandestine approach 48 hours emerged Holland defender favoured Anfield Chelsea, Manchester City Arsenal. In statement Liverpool clalimed recent media speculation source our regret, raises question plug pulled summer transfer priority countless targets mentioned media ended Anfield past. The evidence Southampton allegedly Liverpool  Van Dijk meeting Jrgen Klopp Blackpool, text messages manager player  suggests FSG justified fearing investigation club conduct Premier League complaint further. That happen, Premier League having written clubs request version events. It worth noting Liverpool withdrew 60m-rated transfer, months planning, following communication Southampton earlier day. Liverpool transfer embargo academy level years  second year suspended  having guilty tapping 12-year-old schoolboy Stoke City offering family inducements. Five years ago Fulham received apology Liverpool reported Anfield club Premier League making illegal approach Clint Dempsey. Fulham particularly aggrieved report FSG website claimed USA international joined Brendan Rodgers' squad. It took personal apology Werner Fulham owner, Mohamed al-Fayed, followed letter Liverpool managing director Ian Ayre stated: Our club better pledge will, officials Craven Cottage withdrew complaint. FSG said concerned impact Van Dijk approach Liverpool reputation, sudden U-turn. Its dubious record dealing clubs  transfers seeking end collective sale overseas broadcasting rights  suggests inability learn mistakes bigger problem. It breathtakingly hypocritical Premier League clubs, professional club matter, condemn Liverpool sounding potential recruit. Equally, fair accuse FSG run club behalf England  president, Mike Gordon, sporting director, Michael Edwards, Klopp  turning major statement intent transfer market shambles. The warning signs emerge Monday. It 20 April Liverpool manager, discussing Anfield attractive proposition recruits summer, said: The talks we far positive. That does mean work really positive progress. That good. Klopp missed key defensive target Liverpool approached Southampton bid. Van Dijk question Liverpool commitment deal appeared problematic given contract Southampton years. Liverpool alternative central defensive targets having conscious Van Dijk look Champions League football offer  Burnley Michael Keane, Hull Harry Maguire Napoli Kalidou Koulibaly  ill-afford blunders strive build season progress. Efforts sign Mohamed Salah stalled recent days Liverpool reluctant meet Roma asking price. It week Moore, day Ian Ayre successor, stated Liverpool wo spending 100m just Manchester City spent 100m. But Liverpool, FSG recognise much, need invest 100m-plus squad competing, Klopp hopes, Champions League Premier League title season. Considering Liverpool offering 28m Salah time treated 60m target day Blackpool, Moore attempted contrast City expenditure somewhat inaccurate. City ability signings worth 78.3m line minimum fuss  Bernardo Silva Ederson  contrast reflects poorly Liverpool. There remains plenty time money Klopp enhance squad course but, dramatic turn events Van Dijk saga, rebuilding continue player wanted cornerstone Liverpool defence. A severe avoidable setback. Eoin Morgan singled important figure England one-day revival team assistant coach, Paul Farbrace, believes current barnstorming approach format comes captain near relentless backing players. After wins Bangladesh New Zealand, England Saturday group game Australia Edgbaston Champions Trophy semi-final sewn headache stick Jason Roy parachute Jonny Bairstow opener. Morgan previously said Roy play entire tournament faith tested right-hander average 6.71 seven international innings summer. Farbrace ruled switch, however, saying philosophy captain disastrous 2015 World Cup distant memory. I think Eoin Morgan single biggest factor England success years white-ball cricket, said Farbrace, stepped caretaker coach New Zealand series followed World Cup witnessed epiphany came guns blazing posting 408 Birmingham ODI. Andrew Strauss [the director cricket] took lot credit talked new emphasis, Trevor Bayliss come experienced coach. But me, Eoin Morgan single biggest factor. In buildup game 2015 [against New Zealand] talked players going playing way  there getting stuck playing ordinary shot. People taken lead I think that team flourished. Roy actually golden duck watershed total years ago maiden international innings selflessness shown attacking team means Farbrace fully Morgan current support 26-year-old. He said: We have seen suggests struggling confidence. We consistent selections we stuck people have taking wickets scoring runs. It paid dividends. I do Jason different. At stage tried runs himself himself game. He played way want team stick people case. Bairstow England reserves train indoor school Edgbaston Thursday, XI beat New Zealand Cardiff given extra day off. On prospect knocking Australia Saturday, Farbrace added: Our motivation purely keeping momentum going playing well. We think we learning. Who we playing Saturday irrelevant. It case continuing well. Australia high quality. You want players excited that. Notwithstanding vagaries London transport network, biggest insult beleaguered Scotland support Wembley November delivered pitch. As English fans vacated premises thousands plenty time play, team 3-0 ahead, tricky distinguish occasion visit Lithuania. If strange scenario highlight, consider reverse. Should Scotland, miracle, coasting victory England Hampden Park Saturday rush join nightlife scene. Precisely desire stay celebrate applied Scots recorded famous home win France 2006. Perhaps fact Scotland longer pull kind uplifting, surprise results huge underdogs breeds desperation. If appeared case Scotland place significance meeting Auld Enemy English  Wembley 1977 case point  respective attitudes surely looked contrasting. England supporters perfectly accustomed qualifying major championships bare minimum. While Gareth Southgate hardly classed blue-chip manager, players collectively operate level Scots long removed. But, intriguingly, far professionals concerned notion Scotland actually care fixture England opposition flawed.

But too, Warriors losing finals aching knee: mentally, Curry was there. This was got attention Golden State built 3-1 lead year championship round, discussed team. Something eating Steph. At time, sources told Guardian Curry distracted: previous 13 months much. And it little wonder: time won title league MVPs, adapted new level fame obligations pressures come that. While great players good cutting chatter them, Curry hates let down. Steph pleaser, Bruce Fraser, Warriors assistant coach closest Curry, told Guardian early year postseason. He wants people, that incredibly redeeming quality. But Golden State struggled past Durant Oklahoma City Thunder Western Conference finals lost Cavaliers finals, team worried Curry trying people draining himself.

Undoubtedly presence Durant makes Curry Warriors better. Durant forces Cavs, good defensive team, make choices Golden State star try stop.

When Cook, Bournemouth midfielder, penalised handball halfway line, Italy took England surprise quick free-kick. Andrea Favilli lost marker, Fikayo Tomori, Ascoli forward unselfishly picked strike partner Riccardo Orsolini, fired curling first-time effort Woodman England goal. Italy, though, failed build promising start retreated deeper deeper, happy soak England pressure. Yet long suffocate England attacking talents. Solanke twice went close levelling half-time, heading narrowly wide forcing Andrea Zaccagno, Italy goalkeeper, smart stop Simpson dominated large spells game eventually rewarded excellent performance, Kenny, Everton full-back, Liverpool forward Sheyi Ojo, second-half substitute, particularly influential giving England cutting edge final third.

Less years later Paderborn fallen trapdoor, division Regionalliga amateur football. Three relegations years: feat achieved professional German football. Paderborn fight bitter end time started swinging late. Or seemed, 1860 Munich inadvertently favour. Having relegated second tier, 1860 Munich failed stump 10m needed license compete division. Paderborn quickly stuffed license application envelope, transferred money DFB dare hope backdoor tier latch. 1860 fate rescue Paderborn but, allowed start season tier, club rock bottom. Speaking final game season  scoreless draw away VfL Osnabrck  manager Steffen Baumgart excuses, saying simply failed. Parachuted handful games play April, Hansa Rostock striker simple remit: halt slide. The team picked 11 points games charge, fault, slipped precipice. The club currently swamped gloom Paderborn story uplifting recently. The club roots date 1907 took SC Paderborn 07 1985, local sides merged together. Having spent history Regionalliga, club reached second tier 2005. Promotion ushered new era prosperity established regulars second division, spending seasons level. The second tier country generally unforgiving unpredictable, handful teams moving revolving doors ends. Clubs compete lower-league upstarts charging tables, Hoffenheim RB Leipzig, fending big-budget giants bellyflopped  VfB Stuttgart Hannover 96 season, example. Despite stiff competition, Paderborn couple decent stabs promotion flight, finishing fifth 2010 2012, appointing freshly qualified coach Andr Breitenreiter start 2013-14 season. He helped make history season, second-place finish guaranteed promotion Bundesliga. Only decade playing Regionalliga, Paderborn dining table German football. Despite euphoria confidence Breitenreiter, Paderborn began season favourites drop. The players, however, intention playing old mates second division began maiden Bundesliga campaign bang. They went unbeaten games  including 2-0 win Hannover 96, game remembered Stoppelkamp long-distance wonder strike  league. They stayed days reaching summit German football sing about. They bolted blocks mission squeeze early-season run possible survive. Next stop Munich 4-0 defeat. Welcome Bundesliga. Still, Breitenreiter team dusted secured decent results weeks, picking 11 points winter break leave relatively snug 10th place halfway point season. The winter break slam breaks momentum club built rivals time regroup strengthen. Paderborn started 2015 sluggishly, quickly shedding points reserve collected Christmas, soon flirting Bundesliga dream turned reality relegation fight. They appeared sitting pretty midtable teams Stuttgart, Hamburg, Werder Bremen, Hertha Berlin Jrgen Klopp Borussia Dortmund  bound improve. And came pass. By Valentine Day, Hamburg Bremen leapfrogged them. And, time lost 6-0 home Bayern Munich, Paderborn watching Borussia Dortmund drift distance. Suddenly things began look serious. To credit, spend second start March  problem spent week then, final one. They fought survival right day campaign finished point 15th-place Hertha Berlin went down. The dream nightmare begin.

Less months line, Effenberg steered club trouble, eventually relieved duties Paderborn 17th place, points safety. The new man, academy coach Paderborn player Rene Mller came 10 games stop unthinkable: back-to-back relegations. He won points 10 games Paderborn finished table.

Ange Postecoglou deserves great credit extracting improved second-half performance skittish opening term. At interval Australia second best short options, final whistle savour job done, necessarily done. But praise coach deserves interventions, questions remain quality iteration national side. Notably, looked unsuited task attacking set-up lacked craft flow opponents. Everything began perfectly. Tomi Juric beautifully taken opener rewarded team early industry.

But blink eye vim evaporated. The early goal failed live cliche instead settling confidence hosts forcing visitors overreach, sucked life Australia press Saudis took control.

Postecoglou stated, admirably, managing team intention merely qualify World Cup, Russia win it. On current form, remains wishful thinking, win it, second win row spirit-sapping draws, sneezed at. Next up, small matter Japan away. This year European heartbreak Juventus, domestically old story. The Bianconeri won Serie A sixth consecutive season, collected straight Coppa Italia well. No team won trophy times succession. They unprecedented look routine. And yet, season lacking drama. To contrary, wild campaign right start. There 32 goals scored (not mention red cards) opening weekend alone. The final tally 2.96 game highest Europe leagues. Quantity synonymous quality, gulf Serie A haves nots rarely appeared stark. Yet scintillating football outside Juventus team fell game short treble. Roma Napoli broke 90-goal mark setting club-record points tallies top-flight campaign. Despite finishing third, Partenopei entertaining team Europe. A began season fretting replace Gonzalo Higuan discovered Arkadiusz Milik, unleashed Dries Mertens new centre-forward role. We called false nine' begin with. Thirty-six goals later: much. Then Atalanta, defiant example achieved well-run academy dash trust. Lazio sparkled Simone Inzaghi end-of-season fade. Torino gave helter-skelter entertainment breakout season prolific Andrea Belotti. Some best stories, though, unfolded clubs standings. This season remembered Crotone miraculous escape  claiming 20 points games previously having scraped just 14 29. Over Sampdoria, lifelong fan Christian Puggioni went third-choice goalkeeper dominating Derby della Lanterna 35 years old. And Fabio Pisacane, The Guardian inaugural Player Year 2016?

Moise Kean player born century score Europe top-five leagues, trumped even-younger Pietro Pellegri. If positives, acknowledge negatives. Senad Lulic avoided racism charge suggesting Antonio Rudger selling socks belts came Roma, perceived malicious undertone words. The Italian Football Federation drew international condemnation initial failure support Sulley Muntari walked pitch protest abusive chants May. Although player suspension eventually rescinded, lack coherence matters dispiriting. If Juve hegemony pitch predictable, absence strong leadership Italian football governing bodies it. Just Diego Armando Mertens. Or, actually, do, he really keen comparisons Maradona. But recognise Dries Mertens astonishing season Napoli, adapting new centre-forward role ease tempting wonder thought try sooner. Drafted replace injured Milik, Belgian took games hit stride, December flying. Mertens followed hat-trick Cagliari sticking past Torino week later. His eventual tally 28 league goals came rate 91.6 minutes played. He finished strike Edin Dzeko race Capocannoniere, despite starting fewer games. Nor goals sum contribution. We debate semantics called false nine' (he believes shed label) practical terms effective playing shoulder defender dropping deep direct play. Napoli 2-1 win away Milan case point, Mertens providing assists  brilliant no-look pass, second slick through-ball round Davide Calabria Lorenzo Insigne. Above all, week another, Mertens just looked like man having way fun. He acknowledge contribution team-mates success. Insigne, Jos Callejn Marek Hamsik excellent seasons, rotating cast midfielders. It Mertens, though, shone brightest. Who imagined, summer, man make Napoli forget Higuan? 5) There true overhead strikes Serie A seen recent campaigns (probably Mauricio Pinilla playing often), Andrea Conti pulled Atalanta Genoa  4) It just smoothness Mauro Zrate first-time finish, quality ball Federico Bernardeschi goal Napoli special (that said, Lorenzo Insigne finish game was half bad, either)  3) Did mean it? Maradona reckoned Mertens trying cross ball, chip Joe Hart one-man demolition Torino. Personally, I do really care  2) Simone Verdi pays tribute Marco van Basten  1) Patrik Schick pays homage Dennis Bergkamp  Manuel Locatelli Milan goal narrowly missed shortlist above. His second, match-winner Juventus games later was far behind. These teenager shots target Serie A. Joe Hart named John' team-sheet game Torino, wound conceding goal misjudged punch. Regrettably, despite winning adoration club fans, mishaps come (hough, record, brighter moments Torino shirt, too). Taken isolation, Pepe Reina save Diego Perotti March sensational. The keeper reversed momentum fraction second ball deflected Kalidou Koulibaly right him, tipping post hooking rebound away attacker leg. Context makes stop special. This 93rd minute, Napoli defending 2-1 lead Stadio Olimpico, earned point years. This time, held three. In season seven, 10-goal thrillers, shortage choose from. But I going Fiorentina 3-3 draw Napoli just Christmas. Twice Partenopei noses front, end happy scrape point Federico Bernardeschi turned things sensational solo performance  evoking memories great Fiorentina No10s Roberto Baggio Giancarlo Antognoni. After scoring twice, set Zrate  goal which, you seen, shortlist best season. So Insigne opener Napoli. This days quality match quantity all. Gianluigi Donnarumma; Dani Alves, Leonardo Bonucci, Mattia Caldara, Alex Sandro; Felipe Anderson, Radja Nainggolan, Marek Hamsik, Lorenzo Insigne; Dries Mertens, Edin Dzeko.

Davide Nicola astonishing job Crotone afloat, maintaining belief survival achievable evidence suggested otherwise. He transmitted conviction players, knew mood light face adversity. Eight points adrift late March, took train beach. At table, Massimiliano Allegri demonstrated best managers world. It given Juventus proceed seamlessly losing Paul Pogba. And yet, led start finish. Indeed, Allegri imposed major tactical reshuffle despite team sitting table defeat Fiorentina January  finding formation allowed Gonzalo Higuan, Paulo Dybala, Miralem Pjanic, Mario Mandzukic, Juan Cuadrado starting XI time. In doing so, galvanised players pushed reach level  home abroad. Maurizio Sarri deserves credit way remodelled team approach suit Dries Mertens, does Simone Inzaghi work Lazio. In end, though, I think award Gian Piero Gasperini. It just led Atalanta fourth, best-ever top-flight finish, manner it. He inherited bloated squad lost league games charge, faith youth. Gasperini picked Italy Under-21 internationals Napoli October emerged 1-0 victory. He looked back. For young side, Atalanta showed remarkable resilience. Roberto Gagliardini, eye-catching performers pre-Christmas surge, sold Inter January, team-mates kept winning same. Together breakout stars like Gagliardini, Mattia Caldara, Franck Kessi Andrea Conti, Gasperini getting best veterans.

Back 1994, player rejected local club Millwall appeared world feet. Fresh exploits Republic Ireland World Cup United States, Babb joined Liverpool 1 September 3.6m  British record fee defender. The day joined Anfield Wimbledon John Scales 3.5m Roy Evans set attempting transform fortunes team conceded 55 goals finishing eighth previous season. More decades passed but, more, Liverpool lookout premium defensive reinforcements following campaign saw concede goals top-four sides.

Klopp alternative  quickly  environment saw Manchester City shell 47.5m John Stones August looks frenzied summer goes on. I do think level strikers clubs prepared pay outstanding defenders certainly increased, says Scales, stayed Anfield seasons moving Tottenham. The number clubs Premier League defensive problems season shows lack depth area helps drive price are. There clearly lack top-class defenders available clubs prepared pay them, inflates price. When Sunderland earning 100m finishing table shows just money teams got spend now. Add teams Europe leagues quickly drives prices up. David Luiz remains costliest defender time 50m Chelsea Paris Saint-Germain 2014. That ranks 14th overall list higher bids received Napoli summer Senegal defender Kalidou Koulibaly, matter time broken. It cliche player worth club prepared pay him, says Scales, works English Schools FA pundit Sky Sports' coverage Eredivisie. It difficult weigh factors considered important things defender maturity. There exceptions rule generally want defender years experience younger player. Attacking-wise risk allow develop talent slightly pressurised way you rotating established properly. A club options offensively taken firing line easily expensive defenders you buying form unit. You need maturity physical development able make mistake usually leads goal. Since purchase Eliaquim Mangala eye-watering 42m August 2014, City particularly wasteful pursuit high-class defender partner Vincent Kompany.

Ederson sure left Benfica Manchester City bang. In goalkeeper penultimate league match Portuguese champions, 17th clean sheet season, got assist. A goal-kick 23-year-old led Benfica second goal 5-0 defeat Vitria Guimares. It kick forward Ral Jimnez edge Vitria penalty area, Mexican controlling feet turning goal head. But Ederson kick enormous, clever. It took advantage fact forward, dallying far upfield, offside keeper dead ball. It little-known rule understandable; all, going kick far anyway? Prowess ball feet thought central reason Pep Guardiola Ederson, depending interpret historical exchange rates, second expensive goalkeeper history. It incredible accolade way, given record held Gianluigi Buffon, greatest goalkeeper time. It impressive consider Ederson played season half regular major club. The Brazilian played youth hometown club So Paulo, Benfica took Portugal age 16. Not uncommonly, work teenager moved on, joining second-division Ribeiro Rio Ave. His performances Primeira Liga minnows persuaded Benfica mistake. The club brought Ederson deal cost 500,000 granted Rio 50% future transfer fee (20% which, entirely surprising development, goes Ederson agent, Jorge Mendes). Ederson arrived understudy fellow countryman Jlio Csar, Csar injured March 2016 younger man seized gloves gave back. His performances domestic competition consistently assured display Borussia Dortmund got Europe elite talking. Eventually humbled 4-0 return leg Westfalenstadion, Benfica won leg 1-0, lost Brazilian. The standout moment penalty save Pierre-Emerick Aubemayang. Ederson out-thought striker staying feet ball flew centre goal, completed save club punch drove ball clear goal. This second penalty Ederson saved competition far moment match. His speed movement denied Ousmane Dembl goal yards length reach allowed turn Marco Reus 25-yard effort round post. Best save Christian Pulisic. The American fierce volley outside penalty area took deflections Ederson strong hand turn wide. Within month, Portuguese press reported Guardiola personal Ederson persuade come City. Ederson talent top-class goalkeeper, says Vitor Alvarenga, editor Portuguese magazine Maisfutebol. The special ability Guardiola pay attention strong feet, Ederson agility great keeper security too. I believe soon No1 keeper Brazil. All noises Ederson soon graduate Brazil team. This, combined age, footballing ability fact recently renewed Benfica contract, meant price high. Paradoxically, given travails City big-money goalkeeping recruit, Claudio Bravo, Ederson confidence ball weak spot, says Alvarenga. The risk cope pressure league. In Primeira Liga, facing minor teams 80% time. Ederson great game feet matches shown overconfidence. He learn able control that. When Ian McGeechan coached Lions New Zealand 1993 policy media simple: say polite way. He knew, time Lions rugby entity commercial juggernaut become, difficult tour onerous tourists generated negative headlines word place. Have quiet word afterwards, able days, given sustaining gruel, table, New Zealand journalists, like Geoffrey Boycott, dropping bat loaded questions returning gently inquisitors. McGeechan circumspect Australia South Africa, wanting incite media agenda, especially New Zealand questions tended technical rugby-oriented. As Kiwi, Warren Gatland knew expect tour, surprised persistent questions week, defeat Blues, physical, confrontational gameplan employed Wales decade, caught recording devices making whispered aside end media conference. The subject live Saturday opener New Zealand Provincial Barbarians, expected comfortable victory turned Lions grateful kick ball touch end, disdainful comment New Zealand head coach, Steve Hansen, Gatland favoured style play long coaching career. Never mind Lions hardly rolled Warrenball Whangarei played half second vice versa, taking liberties game won. They sought space contact number factors, untried combinations, skilful opponents, unforced errors rusty scrum-half undermined them. It went basics pulled ahead. Hansen remarks complimentary insulting clearly self-serving. The underlying message Lions try All Blacks game, regarded throwing ball taking risks, play territory drive forwards, exposing players game familiar with. Not New Zealand leave chance. The Lions attack coach, Rob Howley, kept away media announcement squad Tuesday, talked training trying produce rugby chaos, uninhibited unstructured play, All Blacks, combine deliberation skill, pace precision. New Zealand sides tend score tries set pieces, taking advantage 20-metre gap backs lineout 10 scrum create space wide passing alacrity, off-loading, kicking turnovers. And interceptions. They reward multi-phase moves, Lions' travails Auckland, failed turn possession tries, showed why. A productive tactic Gatland Wales earlier decade ball lineout quickly hands Jamie Roberts centre smash way gainline, number defenders set quick ruck ball. Successful teams now, like New Zealand Saracens, lineout licence score tries exploiting space sending juggernaut rumble. The Wales way, scrum, witness 2013 Six Nations decider England, use means gaining penalty. The ploy devised time pace game slower attacking teams given latitude breakdown referees. For battering England 2013, Wales scored tries, final quarter, needed now. When Lions captain, Sam Warburton, said week need score 20 points beat All Blacks, date: defeat seven times 94 Tests decade; 30 points 45% time. For talk week Warrenball boshing, Test series defined Lions cope defence attacking style seen infrequently Europe, Six Nations. Organised chaos way putting chaotic usually referring defence, Lions minutes end Auckland conceded try Super Rugby playbook. The Barbarians gave Lions taste Whangarei, quick detect opportunity, lacked pedigree teams follow, starting Blues, runt Super Rugby litter, New Zealand equivalent Premiership Gloucester Pro12 Blues, Cardiff. It clash styles: set-piece superiority Lions ball-handling skills opportunism Blues. The Lions coordinated Saturday tried play continuity, exposed game foreign Six Nations prevalent major leagues Europe: skill Blues, tries ruled review, trumped power. Why Joe Schmidt, New Zealander, outlaw offload taking charge Ireland? Why Gatland, Kiwi, adopt rigid gameplan Wales having lamented, like Graham Henry him, innate talent complemented basic skills passing? Because recognised players Europe generally skilful intuitive New Zealand played strength charges. Eddie Jones spent time charge England talking need players decisions, appreciating unless able produce plays won match Blues, struggle wrest World Cup All Blacks. Attacks Warrenball misdirected: game Europe, starting complacent Six Nations bills itself greatest tournament world, chance countries start finding tickets hard sell, questioned. A common excuse conservatism Six Nations opening rounds weather. It rained Auckland, adventure home dampened. It New Zealand know now, 1971 Lions attacked aplomb All Blacks direct predictable. At Lions prepared All Blacks, taking aim moving target. They repaired faults opening game, clearing harder breakdown secure quicker ball reading kicks quicker, new ones exposed. It New Zealand way, constantly exposing faultlines, opening Test lost cause. The Lions foundation set pieces goal-kicking, wider out, attack defence, needs difference.

This time year, Oliveira brought managerial career circle joining Portimonense, club grand journey begun 32 years ago. And exactly old club fare Oliveira? They won promotion, course, champions less. As long summer ticks by, allure sixth promotion years entice coach. But Oliveira says wants stay Portimonense. I going continue Portimo, said end season.

It daft excited England grabbing semi-final slot days else. This does guarantee romp final trophy. But current climate makes change agonising postmortems accompanied England early flight home 2015 World Cup. The margin New Zealand defeat Cardiff  87 runs  misleading. After 30 overs run chase Kiwis 156 pursuit 311; Kane Williamson, early scares, cruising Ross Taylor wake. There sign imminent capsize. The New Zealand captain looked serene, rarely inclined play shot involved risk, Morgan turned nearest shock bowler, galloping Mark Wood. He needed wicket badly. Then ball misbehaved, bouncing steeply flicking Williamson glove; Jos Buttler took testing catch safely. It Morgan bit luck treacherous deliveries summoned order like pizzas. But moment England require luck. Morgan bowlers miss trick. The batsman Neil Broom time match short leg posted. Morgan noticed Williamson stared treacherous spot pitch departing like man betrayed. Here Kiwi captain suggesting fates side. That short-leg fielder unlikely catch delivering message Broom. This surface longer trusted; ball popping (there truth Williamson Taylor disconcerted earlier innings); importantly harm reminding new batsman this. England hunting wickets containment. There message Morgan pace bowlers: bang ball pitch bouncer length, policy employed New Zealand bowling end second half England innings, just short length, preferably using cross-seam method. Then happen. Somehow ball grip surface bowling cross seam Cardiff, handy discovery Stuart Broad year ago, dutifully passed on. From Morgan control day little things counting  like decision Jake Ball over; carted 80 outings. But Morgan wanted start place Chris Woakes, expression confidence considered borderline selection game. How Ball respond? With wicket maidens ultimately man-of-the-match award game obvious recipient. The borderline selection superb. Rashid obviously sulking omission Bangladesh. The suspicion Morgan convinced slight ability temperament. The conditions nasty wrist-spinner: gusting wind, pitch offering little turn, much-mentioned short, straight boundaries. Yet Rashid seldom bowled better England; barely bad ball; googly employed frequently, sound indicator confidence high. In field Morgan attacked adroitly (not just brief dalliance short leg). With departure Williamson Morgan kept seamers going asking rate started climb; confident captain slipped vulnerable spinner immediately shed remaining overs required slow bowler. In case Morgan faith Rashid. So 20 overs blustery Cardiff evening England brilliant. But 20 overs. They better contemplate change personnel required. No prizes surface: Jason Roy. The advice echoing around. Some advocate circumspect, try just bat overs elaborating. That sounds like poor advice I suspect thing Morgan saying him. Roy prepared bat maverick manner order. That England want do. He temperament technique play like proper, old-fashioned opener. So selected, allowed freedom continue playing way. Whether Roy continue selected matter. It convenient England play Roy Jonny Bairstow Saturday. However, England likely hellbent playing best free game. After all, opponents Australia.

At 0-30 sets down, Djokovic played blinding point rally. The patrons applauded Serb, lives love, smiled raised defiant fist. But old. It just that: gesture. Thiem broke serve, maybe heart. If Djokovic realistic ambitions reaching semi-finals, primary objective avoid embarrassment. His ground strokes disintegrated. The net grew larger court shrank. Thiem looking legend won 12 slam titles probably collect yet; saw wounded bull. As confident 23-year-old rested final act, leading 5-0, looked calm Djokovic similar situations. There room pity. He wanted bloodless conclusion. Thiem coasted 40-0. Court Suzanne Lenglen, tournament second arena, went silent. Would bagel Djokovic allow point? Thiem netted backhand, smallest mercies.

The free-transfer signing Bosnia-Herzegovina left-back Sead Kolasinac Schalke five-year contract week makes picture little clearer, offer flexibility steeliness Arsenal lacked. Although Kolasinac regular wing-back Schalke country, reputation tough, powerful defender, little positional reason operate left-sided central defender wing-back  familiar full-back role.

When Wallabies play Fiji Melbourne Saturday majority players field Pacific Islander descent. Obviously, Fijians Pacific Islanders, 18 members Wallabies' 34-man squad Pacific Islander descent,though centre Samu Kerevi, seven Fijians, withdrawn following ankle injury. At present, decent percentage Pacific Islanders playing All Blacks, sprinkling British Irish Lions, plus English, French Japanese national teams. It raises question game global level: Pacific Island nations just nurseries cashed-up countries world rugby? It Australia, least, actively poaching lots Pacific Island players, talent finding way shores. The vast majority Pacific Islanders Wallabies squad Australian-born sons migrants, migrated Australia young age. In sense different Wallabies flanker Michael Hooper, son English migrants. But key difference. England population 53 million, Fiji, example, population million (892,000). Rugby hugely popular Pacific Islands, populations broadcast revenues nations comprise big create professional infrastructure needed best players home. As result national teams Fiji, Samoa Tonga really progressed far inaugural World Cup 1987. Significantly, Pacific Island teams  Fiji (1987) Western Samoa (1991 1995)  reached quarter-finals amateur World Cups, (Fiji 2007) tournament professional era. The performance Pacific Island nations odds enormous contribution players Pacific Island descent game world. Under rugby eligibility laws, player played country play eligible birth parentage. World Rugby recently increased residency period Test eligibility years years attempt dissuade major countries poaching Pacific Island players, just means scouts identify talent earlier age. One practical way help Pacific Islanders competitive allow players longer required play adopted countries return nation origin descent. Too Pacific Island players capped major country, play Tests seen international stage. A recent example giant Tongan-born second rower Sitaleki Timani, older brother Lopeti, played 18 Tests Wallabies 2011 2013, required since. Timani, 30, started Clermont 22-16 win Toulon final French Top 14 Sunday. Former Wallabies captain Mark Ella told Guardian Australia thinks letting players return representing Pacific Island nation origin work. In principle I agree long focus nation origin, Ella says. They add value help build reputation Pacific Island teams. I problem that. Which leaves slightly awkward question. Does world rugby really want help Pacific Island nations, afraid competitive?

The pace bowlers, blown course approach wicket, bang target brimful intent. They discovered uneven patch just short length deliveries misbehave hitherto regarded blameless surface. At poor bowlers aim at. Critically mischievous deliveries directed Kane Williamson produce key dismissal. Williamson batted calmly 87 New Zealand, 158 two, course Mark Wood ran bowl. The Kiwi captain, disconcerted steep bounce, ended gloving ball Jos Buttler stumps; left staring angrily surface, signal benign effect dressing room. Now England seized chance magnificently. They sensed Kiwi batsmen started mistrust pitch Liam Plunkett caused consternation hitting Williamson helmet Ross Taylor hand  gave respite. Jake Ball, started maidens, unrelenting senior partners ended man match. Ben Stokes, little expensive, hostile appeared bowl pain. Morgan asked bowl overs. He probably bowled 10 match gone distance. Adil Rashid, restored side, bowled format conditions offered little assistance. He surely England best opponents Asia. After Williamson departure England out-cricket flawless spurned caught bowled chance Rashid. None Kiwis threaten wickets fell flurry. It ended stroll halfway stage England total felt respectable invincible. Their innings quite took completely grounded either. In conditions remarkable quality cricket sides high. At times gusts reached 50mph, treacherously buffeting bowlers, tricky batsmen stand still. Sometimes electronic advertising hoardings blown over; triangular covers stationed boundary ropes, tossed infield. At gales blew away rain. As consequence game unrecognisable, especially bowling Taff end. The boundary perilously short normal conditions later innings Kiwi bowlers tried straight hit equation. Hence bowled succession bouncers, fast slow, batsmen hit long boundary crucially wind. Given exploits England bowlers end later day better advised bang ball length frequently pursuit uneven bounce Plunkett Wood. The England batsmen, marshalled Buttler end, gleaned runs pragmatically, apart barren over. They scored time promising partnership flourish wicket fell. That applied opening partnership Jason Roy lasted little longer usual. He overs 13 runs trying extravagant Adam Milne. He shimmied offside, prematurely leaving leg stump exposed ball ended up. Roy departed fury, presumably premeditation. There guarantees keeps place Australia. Thereafter England indebted significant major contributions Alex Hales, Joe Root, Stokes Buttler. As The Oval Bangladesh, Hales dismissed straight hitting six, ponder. Root purred usual, caressing sixes left-arm spinner, Mitchell Santner, knowledge clear mid-on. In partnership Stokes frequently denied strike (he faced 15 balls Stokes 37) upset rhythm. He bowled inside edge, false shot. Stokes, hit wonderfully crisp boundaries, dots caught man Buttler stuff. In fact fluent usual; boundary came 24th delivery edge keeper, becalmed.

Liverpool badly need wholesome meat-and-potatoes centre-back, stalwart excels defending fundamentals. Picture Mamadou Sakho good day. Now picture Sakho having good day nearly day. But Van Dijk that. He precious talents, ball-playing centre-back sort John Stones supposedly become, stopper creates. He sashay forward finesse Jol Matip and, boot, potent aerial threat set pieces mean free-kick. Whether four, Liverpool answer David Luiz, more. If Van Dijk wanting join Liverpool despite lucrative offers elsewhere, speaks character Klopp. It suggests distinguishes merely winning winning gloriously, champion hero.

Southampton reported Liverpool Premier League allegedly making illegal approach Virgil van Dijk. The south-coast club furious stories Monday suggested Liverpool driving seat sign defender summer, face leading clubs  Chelsea Manchester City. They argue way stories run unless Liverpool spoken Van Dijk and, thereby, breach Premier League rules tapping up. Several stories contained line Van Dijk wanted Anfield Jrgen Klopp involvement recruitment  Southampton suggest adds illegal approach. It understood Dutchman preference Anfield. Southampton clear Premier League received official approach Liverpool Van Dijk and, generally, stressed player years run contract, meaning strong position regarding does play. Liverpool reportedly willing pay world-record sum defender  expected 60m  break Southampton resistance prepared match City offer Van Dijk contract worth 200,000 week. Van Dijk Liverpool record signing highest-paid player deal ahead. They declined comment Southampton accusations. The league written Southampton Liverpool ask version events. Liverpool spent 96m Southampton players summer 2014. In transfer window took Adam Lallana (25m), Dejan Lovren (20m) Rickie Lambert (4.5m). Nathaniel Clyne (12.5m) Sadio Man (34m) followed summers 2015 2016 respectively. Southampton position manager, Claude Puel, remains delicate complicated given left club actively pursuing successor. Yet Saints confirm departure lined new man, represent upgrade. Puel, arrived June year, led Saints EFL Cup final, lost Manchester United, eighth-placed finish league. But style football frequently derided turgid, team struggled goals French manager booed St Mary crowd final day season Stoke City, writing wall. Puel sat board end-of-season review, well, messages support hierarchy. He away holiday emerged target French club St-tienne. Southampton accept Puel entitled pay-off final years contract want manager receptive promoting players academy vision attractive, passing football. There familiar Gianluigi Buffon hoisting Serie A trophy aloft game Crotone end May. Now, seen that? Ah, yes, 2016. Oh, 2015 well. 2014? Yep, so. 2013 2012? Of course. Juventus racked consecutive Serie A titles. In seasons picked nearly 200 points Internazionale. Their dominance spectacular. It story Germany, Bayern Munich won Bundesliga years row Borussia Dortmund secured double 2012. In France, Paris St-Germain won past league titles. Where fun that. True, England Spain slightly better spread teams won league main cup (six different teams past years England Spain) dominance clubs means that, Italy Germany, pretty know August going win league. So care? Why watch? We asked writers dominance teams affecting league signs fans turning TVs going stadiums. After Juventus won record-breaking sixth consecutive Scudetto, it fair say things getting repetitive Serie A. The problem pushed bar high. Back 2011-12 Juve claimed title sequence 84 points. Roma Napoli exceeded number season, looked close dislodging Bianconeri. The standard league decidedly uneven. Juventus re-established best teams planet, extent dragged chasing pack them. Napoli play entertaining football Europe, acquitted better Real Madrid Champions League season 6-2 aggregate defeat suggested. Roma, too, improved. But significant gap teams tier. Lazio Atalanta  especially impressive development homegrown talent  compelling, truly threatened three. The Milan clubs trapped permanent disarray  albeit expected spend big new Chinese owners summer. Fiorentina remain frustratingly flaky. And drift half table, talent levels fall steeply. Hardly surprising consider 13 teams posted total revenues 68m 2015-16 accounts. Overall, mixed picture. Juventus European exploits restored prestige Serie A, highlight far fallen behind. Calls division reduced 18 teams growing louder Italian Football Federation president, Carlo Tavecchio, called pure utopia. Has league TV deal suffered? Serie A TV deal works 1.13bn year. Predictability harmed league marketability Juventus strong performances Europe counterbalance. Half-empty stadiums, poor performance Milan clubs struggling national economy tangible concerns. PB The accusation relentlessly repetitive tiresome, mention little baffling. Who chants league team? And wound it? Why does occupy people much, extent reference Spain, innocuous, guaranteed immediately pub league similarly dismissive comment reply? The accusation flawed, too, does mean entirely false. Spanish football does clubs: Atltico Madrid won title years ago reached past Champions League finals. That underlines fact Spain two-horse race  there element that, Madrid Barcelona having won bar past 10 titles  rest bunch donkeys. Sevilla, Athletic Bilbao, Celta Vigo Villarreal recent years reached semi-finals Europe, Spanish football dominated. Celta, 13th La Liga, dreadful miss away eliminating Manchester United taking Spanish team final season Europa League. Meanwhile, season lacked surprises. Madrid dropped points Eibar Las Palmas. Barcelona lost title Deportivo, Celta Mlaga. For year, Sevilla looked challenge title. Teams compete Madrid, champions, needed goals 10 minutes quarter games. It was stroll  B Team kept winning final weeks, just look good reserves are. Few doubt Madrid Barcelona win Premier League too; do just dominate domestically, dominate Europe super club era. And Sevilla fell away, knocked Champions League Leicester (whom overrun last-16 leg), true end domestic season familiar duo competing final day, season, real shifts: four, year. It true teams really compete (although Madid needed last-minute winner defeat relegated Sporting Gijn, example), simply money leagues  improving little. It Scotland sun problems, couple years seen mitigated little, bad seven seasons ago. Spain other clubs compete economically long way Premier League teams regard. Another thing: fans treated horribly Spain, kick-off times decided late dictated entirely TV (whose coverage poor) subject change, supporters criminalised utterly voiceless. Madrid Barcelona enormity does eclipse brilliant  brilliant  discouraging. It impossible imagine ending, too. But, then, thought season Atltico ended champions  colossal, miraculous success rightly celebrated hidden deeper, troubling reality. Has league TV deal suffered? The new TV deal, managed centrally negotiated collectively, enshrined law, designed increase raised redistribute money. The plan help reduce huge inequalities league, Madrid Barcelona far higher amounts rest new formula calculates earnings based league position, historical position, social base audience. Barcelona Madrid expect make 140m year, teams expect closer 42m  huge leap figures close 15m recently season.

Six quite high number course, thought start season Arsenal Manchester United ones missing top-four places, Pep Guardiola Manchester City end empty-handed. The situation pertain season too, feels English football old story advised pick 2018 August guesswork looks months later. England doing right clubs stature Manchester United way, half dozen potential title candidates lot healthier situation used set stone Arsenal Chelsea turns challenge United dominance. Yet reasonably lively absorbing contest table big story. Beneath season Everton, seemingly stuck permanent man land achievers relegation concerns, followed long gap Southampton eighth place 46 points. To perspective, 46 points half Chelsea accrued points Swansea Crystal Palace managed seasons haunted fears dropping Championship. Although entertainment sparkling upper echelon, league considered healthy two-thirds real purpose ensuring survival. Has league TV deal suffered? No. The Premier League present TV deal worth monster 5.136bn years. Money pouring English football, owners longer flaky types seeking self-promotion investors know turn profit. The English flight divided haves have-nots, certainly, remains watchable unpredictable ends. It easy task pick winner, clubs near capacity Crystal Palace Chelsea Hull Liverpool. Upsets occur leagues, foreign players country frequently express surprise fight smaller sides refuse lie down. PW That Bayern Munich just sealed fifth successive Bundesliga title  margin 15 points despite looking under-par campaign  undoubtedly concern. It second time German football behemoth managed run. The truth is, though, Bayern dominance partly result competitiveness, Borussia Dortmund successive title wins 2011 2012 provoking best-ever. The equation club adopting internationalist strategy. Despite image Bayern approach away competitors' best players, signings Robert Lewandowski Mats Hummels accentuating feeling, adventurous transfer market recent years, buoyed profits Champions League Allianz Arena, fully own. Bayern dominance does drive international Bundesliga, discovering picture keeps people glued. Even title race non-event year, drama rest table, terms European places bottom. On season final day, half teams play for. The success Europe-bound Freiburg, struggles giants Hamburg, it money correlating success. Attendances reassuringly stable  season slight dip wiped 2017-18 modest Darmstadt Ingolstadt relegated replaced better-supported Stuttgart Hannover. Has league TV deal suffered?

Leg spinner Mason Crane absolutely dampen enthusiasm advancing burgeoning talent match figures 57-17-154-5, Ian Bell team languish rock bottom, winless looking break season started. Yorkshire leapfrogged Lancashire fourth place three-day demolition old enemy match disparity seam bowling resources proved critical. While Steven Croft Ryan McLaren (396) 72 career class wickets name, Gary Ballance whistle Ryan Sidebottom (745), Tim Bresnan (499) Jack Brooks (364). But experienced quartet captain cause grateful, Ben Coad backing first-innings wickets couple second dig 31 Division One wickets 14 season, best England-qualified bowlers distance. With England slated play seven Test matches months 6 July, do surprised Highway gets gig country breakthrough season done. Flogging results Lord roads (they just pitch A41a) hard complement overs but, weather intervenes, thankless task. Once Lewis Gregory notched maiden century Dean Elgar continued extended warm-up Test series second season, Middlesex knew par score surely make draw likely conclusion  proved wickets added 110 runs. Though Somerset young skipper, Tom Abell, relieved batted hours season best 71 out, season three win it going 2016 day, stuck sixth seventh places, looking win campaign. Nottinghamshire charge Division One stalled draw lowly Derbyshire Trent Bridge. With second-innings wickets lead just 51, Chris Read thankful that, 74 critical setting visitors target 216 proved just 26 rain came time, Derbyshire big favourites wickets overs hand. Missing James Pattinson Stuart Broad (36 wickets 14.7 281 runs 46.8 2017), Notts lacked firepower Derbyshire count unfortunate registered red ball win years. With second place Kent sitting round fixtures, third-placed Worcestershire chance jump win Sussex, club turmoil Luke Wright shock resignation captaincy eve match. As case, change top, Chris Nash taking reins, galvanised side, charges racking 579 8 declared good time, Luke Wells adding 155 258 took guard Hove. When visitors cruised 215 loss reply approaching lunch Day Three, draw looked likely, admirable Daryl Mitchell fell 121, Sussex seamers scented blood, and, just 30 overs later, Mitchell himself middle, following on, 267 behind. Despite missing experienced new ball man Steve Magoffin, Nash rotated medium pacers who, pitch offering assistance, restricted Worcestershire highest second innings stand just 79 runs wrapped win early afternoon session Day Four. As auditions go, was bad Chris Nash. Durham, place Division One season forfeited current leaders Hampshire financial problems, fought like cornered tigers match Northamptonshire, lose penultimate ball, rain, visitors down. After conceding innings deficit 172, maiden century Cameron Steel (who sounds like Pakistani team American born player) supported 54 nearly hours (who else?) Paul Collingwood, clawed Durham game. But Colly opposite number, Alex Wakely, ideas captain knock 84 laid foundations gasp win. Durham seek victory season (and points turn total positive), does eventually arrive, glasses raised north east corner England.  This article The 99.94 Cricket Blog Follow Gary Naylor Twitter For stands 5ft 2in, I hit ball pretty far. During professional golf career, I longest hitters tour. I averaged 270 yards tee, I consistently outdrove competitors 30 40 yards. When I played pro-ams (mostly men) I'd told I hit far girl. To I retort, Yeah? Well, hit short dude. But truth is, I hit golf ball far woman, particularly size. Recently, PGA Champions Tour veteran Fred Funk came comments length modern courses. I feel like I ladies tour right now, said. I did mean derogatory sense, all. Just Annika [Sorenstam) outdrove [in recent skins game], I little bitter. The USA Today columnist Christine Brennan called Funk comments sexist. In article, called question Funk views women, This man sounded quite comfortable delivering snide remark women golf. This sparked interesting debate difference men women golf, particular, female male athletes. It tough dispute that, average, men stronger faster women. Look stats driving distances PGA LPGA players. The women tour swing drivers average 95mph. The men? 113 mph. Does make men better golfers? No. And recognizing differences bodies away acknowledging makes male female athletes great. Let look scoring average tour: currently LPGA player So Yeon Ryu averaged 69.21 season, compared Jordan Spieth 69.41 PGA. Those figures far anomaly  averages tours comparable. And case women considered superior: Dana Finkelstein LPGA ranked No1 driving accuracy, hitting 88.2% fairways season. Her counterpart PGA, Steve Stricker, hits 72.85%. In addition, Lexi Thompson leads LPGA average 79.8% greens regulation season, compared Dustin Johnson, No1 PGA tour 72.6%. Looking stats alone, women accurate men. What lack power, make finesse. The US Open champion Geoff Ogilvy, said year. I especially like [women] hit shots hybrids. It joke talented clubs. I actually prepared believe Lydia Ko better vast majority male pros from, say, 200 yards out. She ridiculously good. In fact, I'd far say women players consistently hit closer aiming guys, Ogilvy wrote article Golf Australia. So Brennan offense Funk comments, I saw pointing know: men professional golf hit ball further. It sexist, fact. Acknowledging makes men women distinct  example, male players' huge drives female players' unerring accuracy  highlight things make professional athletes extraordinary. What offense people think women elite athletes simply bodies perform way male counterparts. And critics women sports account weekend warrior, male female, close matching performance professional athlete gender. As sportswriter, I hate differentiating male female athletes. I feared writing article I playing internalized sexism I raised believe women sports growing up: women are good athletes men. But case female athletes just exceptional male counterparts, skilled ways men not. Accepting embracing provides foundation women continue flourish sports.

It instructive fared higher level Champions League qualifier Steve McClaren Arsenal provided early chance just quickly Cheick Tiot learning. The sight sticking Robin van Persie like glue Twente home leg, subduing striker irrelevance insistent performance times cared little boundaries law, lingered minds memories jolted firmly course. Tiot eventually joined Newcastle, attracted tenacity undeterred inconsistency possession led suitors waver, 2010 himself working McClaren years later. Both seen better days 2015-16 season reflected appallingly Tyneside club but, McClaren ended sacked scarcely mourned, Tiot rode turbulent interlude standing supporters relatively unimpaired. Given revolving door St James' Park past decade, says plenty. But good reason enjoy presence Tiot, wholehearted proactive performer played kind intensity fans appreciate things going well. I do like make lot noise, said months arrival non-verbal ways making point. It helped that, 19th appearance club  having picked yellow cards red  produced kind flourish that, blink eye, moulds cult hero. The left-footed 25-yard volley pegged Arsenal, opponents warmed towards, improbable 4-4 draw perfect execution timing. The moment etched instantly Premier League folklore, mind club; bolt blue likely rarely come close happening again. It goal Newcastle; tally bookings reach 14 end season discipline fully mastered. But Tiot operated; compromising ball won. You game Cheick do player, team-mate James Perch said costly red card Sunderland October 2012. A Tyne-Wear derby occasion mistakes, forgiven error Tiote. The idea leaving pitch anathema. Tiot simply tale unchannelled aggression. Between 2011 2013 Yohan Cabaye formed league best midfield partnerships  efficient blend vision, vigour tactical intelligence apex came 3-0 win Manchester United January 2012. This Tiot peak but, Cabaye on, stayed Newcastle despite intermittent talk Champions League clubs  particular Arsenal, certainly welcomed. As Newcastle fortunes ebbed, form fortune too, injuries dogging final seasons ensuring that, time moved Beijing Enterprises February, disappointment departure sentimental directed impact revitalised team promotion campaign. Joining club highest level eluded Tiot appeared twice Ivory Coast Africa Cup Nations-winning campaign 2015. That success meant everything; little come easy early days football, starting semiprofessional club FC Bibo home city Yamoussoukro finessing qualities aid proper boots age 15. That I today, said upbringing guaranteed nothing. Tiot, though, turn player guaranteed ounce perspiration soon stepped pitch. The frayed edges there, time best; tragedy football, world inhabited it, mourning now. Eoin Morgan great Irishman suggest imitation sincerest form flattery mediocrity pay greatness agreement Oscar Wilde. For Morgan acknowledges England side, transformed calamitous World Cup 2015, acquired qualities Kiwi humbled Wellington, New Zealand, February 2015. On dismal day English cricket Morgan team beaten wickets 37.4 overs spare. The New Zealanders required 124 runs victory circumspect response. Brendon McCullum hit 77 25 balls. Morgan reminded contest for want better word rain falling Cardiff. It sort men boys, said adding one surprise, but I think it completely different now, years line. We got completely new team pretty [in fact endured match Wellington play Cardiff Tuesday]. And hopefully moving forward. No doubt England progressed template image New Zealand 2015 World Cup campaign. McCullum Morgan good friends England captain, intelligent man, bound picked brains Kiwi captain. Morgan keen emphasise England learnt New Zealand. To adopt pupil/teacher pose just vital clash countries appropriate. But acknowledged impact 2015 World Cup. If look teams got semi-final stage World Cup, score regular totals 350. So I think they contributed change whole. The way New Zealand went playing cricket probably closer way now. We similar characteristics values it probably easiest relate teams later stages. I think dominant factor New Zealand crucial confidence group time, did it. Morgan claim justification confidence squad now. This helps explain reluctance tinker team  batsmen. Faith Jason Roy remains open batting. That yearning consistency enhanced chances Steven Finn getting call-up Chris Woakes' strain diagnosed. Morgan said Finn straightforward choice, backing consistency selection trust shown players recently. We tried like like [when choosing replacements] can. But ca guy throw ball stage order try make impact game. And Finny guys. I'd hesitation playing tomorrow felt right thing do. It depends wicket, Morgan said, remembering mention quality pace bowling squad. However, mention Finn chilling experience Wellington match years ago. Sometimes bowling figures lie but, stares 2-0-49-0, look good. The one-word explanation McCullum. At Tuesday Kiwis' World Cup captain commentary box, cause little damage. The make-up bowling attack occupy Morgan mind Tuesday morning. Mark Wood, Liam Plunkett, Ben Stokes  recovering fast knee problems  Moeen Ali bound play. Then England pick Adil Rashid, Jake Ball, David Willey Finn. A sweaty pitch favours retaining pace bowlers; so, too, short, straight boundaries Cardiff. However, notion Kiwis play Rashid Asian nations. And legspinner, left Bangladesh, trusted performer ODIs. New Zealand probably robbed victory rain fell Edgbaston match Australia. They retain no-holds barred approach McCullum insisted years ago, hostile pacemen Tim Southee, Adam Milne Trent Boult dangerous strikers ball Kane Williamson, Kiwi Joe Root  way round? Martin Guptill hits long ball order mild-mannered man opening batsman Derbyshire. Like Morgan wish exaggerate similarities sides recognised England have similar brand batting way we gone business years. He said: So it probably going pretty exciting game tomorrow I think fans looking forward it. There savour puddles disappear. An opening pair Guptill Luke Ronchi does let deliveries pass harmlessly by; great Irishman (still Morgan) admitted can resist temptation. Morgan reports Stokes pain-free nearly there' England bubbling optimism defied grey clouds long white tarpaulins visible arrival Cardiff Monday. Eoin Morgan, captain, lost services Chris Woakes strained bullish advance Ben Stokes, totemic all-rounder dodgy left knee match New Zealand win secure passage semi-finals. I think he close fitness. He came day [when England played Bangladesh The Oval], bowling overs [seven] intended. But I think we nearly there. He pain days now. So, continues, there chance bowl 10 overs. Some England players, including Stokes, staying close scene latest atrocity London Morgan confident men deal climate uncertainty nature security measures place. Within team concerns. I think sort proved cope Leeds happened Manchester [England played South Africa Headingley immediately terrorist attack Manchester Arena]. Obviously guys chatting constantly it far stayed lot live nearby. So we talking making sure everybody feels talk hide away it. The make-up England team undecided, torrential rain fell Cardiff Monday. Morgan glimpsed surface. It looked like reasonably good pitch yesterday [Sunday] extra 24 hours hot, sweaty cover change things morning.

For symbolised  club president, Florentino Prez, described emblematic signing  useful around. However given roles largely fulfil  went way. He wanted real. His word. He wanted win. Despite Saturday night showpiece Cardiff, season quite yet. A round internationals tagged apologetically weekend, England involved World Cup qualifier Scotland Glasgow Saturday friendly France takes place days later. A return France inevitably evoke memories tired tournament campaign coming cataclysmic end usual defeat Iceland, positive reflect changed then. When England Scotland year Euro 2016 kicked off, France overcoming stubborn Romania late Dimitri Payet goal. Payet West Ham player time, scored goal proud Slaven Bilic climbed desk ITV studio set express excitement. On 10 June year Roy Hodgson England manager, frustrated following day 1-1 draw Russia, Wayne Rooney captain, Gareth Southgate charge under-21s Sam Allardyce seen dancing night away Marbella celebration Sunderland Premier League survival. When began unravel summer things happened fast hard believe England second manager tournament ended, ludicrous consider Allardyce different employers timeframe, doing solid job Crystal Palace Sunderland crucially bungling big opportunity middle. It odd Allardyce ostensibly game, England potential untested, manager far impressive club record learning job, Southgate enthusiasm keynote speaking, pints wine making large money just hours' work unlikely prove undoing. Results might, far England making smooth progress. At half way stage World Cup qualifying points clear Group F, unbeaten, trickier away trips  Slovakia Slovenia way. In theory, games ought prove difficult far toughest groups, Scotland away uncomfortable England, Gordon Strachan fourth place wins games. This reasonably regarded Southgate biggest test date borne mind evaluating quiet determined way manager gone job. Perhaps dropping Rooney easy decision, given limited number games Manchester United relatively muted impact played, Southgate sure left door open future. It possible Rooney form run games different club season happen obstacle return. Southgate simply sensible thing, just recalling keeping faith Jermain Defoe. Despite age player perceived closeness retirement Defoe playing games Rooney proving effective pitch deserves squad. At end age scale Southgate right stick guns Marcus Rashford, Euro 2016 does need return under-21s establishing himself United team. Jos Mourinho want player under-21s tournament Poland but, Southgate says, decision internationals important parts England setup 10 years' time England manager. Somebody protect him, somebody manage development young player, call, Southgate pointed out. Marcus senior squad merit, year. His performances warrant senior squad. He gone under-21s right. He 19-year-old player exceptional season point close 60 matches. Southgate correct saying Rashford England forward good form  Harry Kane, Jamie Vardy Defoe strong seasons  Dele Alli, Adam Lallana Raheem Sterling choose support positions Scotland quite worried contain English attacking threat. With exceptions, obligation use Rooney starting lineup sidestepped, England travel Scotland young experienced squad, players performing consistently clubs. As times managing national team look simple, is, art keeping things simple distracted peripheral considerations. Allarcyce tell Southgate that. Most previous England managers tell knows, stand fall tournament performances results qualifying. Yet looking happened immediate predecessor Southgate heart. At likely tournament. Antoine Griezmann pledged immediate future Atltico Madrid, saying dirty move leave club transfer ban upheld. The France forward, 26, heavily linked potential world-record transfer Manchester United, court arbitration sport week upheld ban club registering new players transfer window. Speaking Sunday morning French television programme Telefoot, Griezmann said: The ruling CAS come through. Atltico recruit. With sporting adviser, Eric Olhats, decided stay. It hard time club. It dirty leave now. We talked leaders season. Atltico, city rivals Real Madrid, handed two-window transfer bans January 2016 multiple breaches global football rules registration under-18s clubs failed appeals Fifa September. The Spanish giants took cases CAS but, Real ban halved transfer window December, Atltico announced Thursday reduction given regarding financial penalty  720,000 440,000. That leaves unable sign new players January window, ending club bid bring Lyon striker Alexandre Lacazette, seen likely replacement Griezmann.

A test opening St Petersburg Zenit Arena February treated 10,000 spectators car racing, motorcycle tricks, dancers performing bear introduced Russia greatest hero. But patriotic ceremony failed note stadium, Russia kick Confederations Cup fortnight preparation year World Cup, built immigrant workers Asia, including world repressive countries, North Korea. A subcontractor asked remain anonymous said 190 downtrodden North Koreans worked long hours days August November year one, 47-year-old, died site. These guys afraid speak people. They do look anyone. They like prisoners war, subcontractor said. An employee North Korean state company brings workers Russia told Observer St Petersburg construction site men worked long hours pay regime Pyongyang facilitate country defence, includes nuclear weapons programme. Tens thousands North Korean labourers Russia work slave-like conditions, according Marzuki Darusman, United Nations special rapporteur human rights Democratic People Republic Korea. The companies hire become complicit unacceptable forced labour, said. Although law passed Russia 2013 exempts employers connected World Cup country labour regulations, North Koreans' work stadium calls question Fifa Moscow commitment human rights preparations tournament. In blanket statement response questions use North Korean labour, Fifa told Observer monitored conditions migrant workers continue follow allegations regards human rights violations. The St Petersburg construction committee said authorities conducted regular inspections make sure conditions Zenit Arena site met Russian labour laws. But according subcontractor, North Koreans site worked 11 hours day $10-$15, seven days week. They earned migrant workers lived cramped conditions, workers sharing construction caravan. The North Korean died heart attack, subcontractor said. He added fatigue danger. When lose reaction time fatigue, hurt blue, just like that. While Russia World Cup preparations number fatalities 2022 competition Qatar, hundreds migrant workers killed huge construction boom, Observer 2015 workers died accidents Zenit Arena. The subcontractor said died August December 2016, including North Korean. Allegations exploitation North Korean workers latest chapter spotted history Zenit Arena. When St Petersburg started planning new stadium 2006 Zenit, project scheduled finish end 2008 cost 6.7bn roubles (92m today exchange rate). As construction finally neared end decade later, city vice-governor, Igor Albin, said cost 68,000-seat venue risen sixfold 43bn roubles. The actual cost likely higher  owing corruption, mismanagement fluctuations exchange rate  making expensive stadiums seat world, according Dmitry Sukharev, construction worker heads St Petersburg branch global anti-corruption NGO Transparency International. The St Petersburg construction committee respond request comment costs. Despite huge spending, Fifa reportedly year Zenit Arena removable pitch meet shock absorption standards. Vladimir Putin said told Fifa president, Gianni Infantino, stadium scandal-ridden construction very sad story promised defects fixed. After city fired general contractor July delays cost overruns, vice-governor Albin managed gather 4,000 workers site final push finish it. That companies brought North Korean workers, subcontractor said. Pyongyang exporting manpower Russia Soviet times, including logging camps Russia far east. In testimony provided Observer, Choi Myong-bok, refugee escaped logging camp Amur region 2002, said camp a living hell, open-air prison, wardens watched clock. He said lived inhumane conditions crowded construction caravans infested lice bedbugs subsisted melted snow, rice, salt mushrooms berries gather. Pyongyang earns $2.3bn (1.8bn) year sending workers Choi abroad, China Russia. This despite UN sanctions meant deprive foreign currency developing nuclear weapons. Moscow recently signed agreements Pyongyang increase trade employment North Korean workers agricultural timber operations. According federal migration service, 30,000 North Koreans estimated Russia 2015. Last year governments signed treaty extradite citizens illegally enter country, agreement condemned UN mechanism send North Korean workers seek asylum face torture death. But handful sought asylum. They families runs away would good family, it communist order there, like Stalin, said Maria Trush, administrator branch Apart Hostel, five-storey dormitory industrial zone outside St Petersburg close North Korean subcontractor office. Trush housing construction workers past years. She said North Koreans typically worked like ants, starting 8am ending 11pm. In little free time had, watched North Korean state television dubbed Soviet films. Malsar Khuseinov, director Soyuz-Stroi, construction company employs 200 North Koreans, said workers allowed extend work day need meet deadline. Pyongyang commands controls them captains ground, said. They right kind discipline, said, adding out question run away. Another construction firm, Dalpiterstroi, employed 60 North Koreans Zenit Arena, company PR advertising director, Anna Bochenkova, said. But worked eight, 11, hours day, denied allegations low pay overcrowded construction caravans. They work good conditions standard pay, like workers St Petersburg construction sites, market price, good living conditions, said. Bochenkova said comment North Korean worker died denied caused overwork. A person die heart attack just walking street world, said. On recent night suburb Shushary, reporter two-storey, metal-sided dormitory North Korean workers live large cluster similar housing. A man preparing food small, low kitchen immediately cellphone minutes well-dressed man gave Choi arrived. He said translator North Korean state company brings workers Russia. Thirty-two men lived Shushary dormitory, said, 100 working suburb Pargolovo. A North Korean fell death nine-storey building June, Choi confirmed. The men sent Russia years, work 12 hours day hours lunch, rest weekends, make 50,000-60,000 roubles month (685-825), 5%-10% Pyongyang government, said. Nearby, group North Korean workers pouring concrete 22nd storey residential tower 10.30pm. When asked, base tower said 50,000 60,000 roubles month. A security guard quickly ended conversation. The Observer ran Choi worker muddy track dormitories building sites. The worker said started day 8.30am 9am carried 7pm 8pm, hours lunch. That day, delayed batch concrete pushed work later, said. I came city, beautiful famous world, said, adding worked Russia 2014. Asked made, said 50,000 60,000 roubles month. The conversation cut short security guards briefly detained reporter construction trailer. The Norwegian football magazine Josimar recently group 100 North Koreans living construction caravans working long hours Dalpiterstroi site, surrounded barbed wire guards dogs. In reality, workers likely make far figures cite Pyongyang regime takes 30%-50% income, according Andrei Lankov, North Korea expert. Nevertheless, working abroad ways North Koreans improve financial situation, added. While exceptions standard 40-hour week stipulated Russia labour code, working 10 hours day years, like North Koreans said do, violate law, lawyers told newspaper. Last week emerged Infantino admitted Fifa aware issues. In letter dated 22 May Nordic FA presidents raised issue, said: Fifa aware firmly condemns appalling labour conditions North Korean workers employed various countries world. He acknowledged inspection team Fifa decent work monitoring system, set address concerns human rights abuses, strong evidence presence North Korean workers construction site St Petersburg visit November. The issues subsequently raised respective company general contractor, Infantino wrote. Fifa said inspection March North Koreans working site. According Svetlana Gannushkina, veteran migrant rights activist helps North Korean refugees, authorities rarely raise questions workers. The rights people working territory respected, matter overlords are, is done, said. It area complete lawlessness. Gianluigi Buffon stood hands hips, staring vacantly distance moving felt like age. Behind Real Madrid supporters raucously celebrating goal second space minutes, flooring Juventus leaving Buffon looking like man knew dream long clock ticked down. This perfect finale Buffon talked 24 hours earlier, 39-year-old expressed hope hands major trophy elude distinguished career spanned decades. Buffon won Serie A titles, World Cup 2006 represented Italy 168 times, Champions League winners medal trophy cabinet and, realistically, probably be. It evening brought uncomfortable sense deja vu Buffon Juventus, lost seven European Cup finals forgiven fearing worst stage competition. Buffon appeared showpieces latest ended humiliating fashion Real Madrid demonstrated accomplished team Europe distance. In respect Buffon proved right. Asked come contest himself Cristiano Ronaldo, Juventus goalkeeper replied: I conceited say that, I myself pedestal Cristiano Ronaldo. My role defend; complete opposites. He able determine outcome game me. That certainly case Ronaldo struck Madrid goal inflicted damage second. Casemiro Marco Asensio got Madrid goals night Buffon beaten times, twice deflections. It kind occasion veteran goalkeeper team-mates, totally lost way second half Luka Modric Toni Kroos took control midfield Ronaldo does does best. What transformation opening 45 minutes, Juventus took game Madrid, attacking conviction scoring goal worthy winning Champions League, let merely equalising final. Unfortunately Mario Mandzukic, spectacular overhead kick speared Keylor Navas, Madrid keeper, end lovely involving Gonzalo Higuan Alex Sandro, brought ephemeral joy. Juventus sustain high-tempo approach interval. Paulo Dybala, scored twice quarter-final win Barcelona highly regarded, imposed himself game withdrawn. Higuan, assist Mandzukic goal, carried little threat, influence Sami Khedira Miralem Pjanic, substituted second half picking injury, started wane. The sight Juan Cuadrado receiving red card 84th minute second bookable offence summed second half. It poor decision officials, Sergio Ramos time career guilty play-acting, stage Juventus tried going wrong. The solid defensive base Champions League campaign built evaporated. Juventus conceded times 90 minutes Madrid previous 12 matches competition Old Lady experienced back-line started look age. It impossible feel sympathy Buffon, trudged rest players applaud Juventus supporters stayed Sergio Ramos hoisted European Cup Cardiff sky. Buffon extraordinary servant Juve, club joined world record 51m 2001 replace Edwin van der Sar, strange day wearing No1 jersey club dominated Italian football past seasons. It feels like forever. When Buffon debut professional footballer 1995, George Weah Roberto Baggio lining Milan him, legends game fifties. He clocked 1,000 games since, including 108 appearances Champions League, player Juventus squad featured defeat Milan penalties 2003 final. Although Massimiliano Allegri left door open possibility Buffon trying season, Juventus manager refusing accept idea players team reached end cycle time usher new era, age history appear Italian goalkeeper. Perhaps going mind stood penalty area Madrid goal. I wondered want race cars motorbikes road. A normal, narrow country road lined brick walls, hedges, telegraph poles iron gates; road furniture it known racing circles. That need speed I experienced bikes cars, I opted soft option purpose-built track width run-off areas. During decades working motor sport, I gripped road racing  countless laps on-board footage, absolute speed imminent danger. I lucky build great friendships riders like John McGuinness, legendary Isle Man TT racer, turned backs soft option embrace road. But April, I'd actually road race. So I novice spectator Cookstown 100  2.1-mile circuit County Tyrone forms date 10-race season tracks border. I'd heard female riders  Melissa Kennedy, Veronika Hankocyova Yvonne Montgomery  heart male-dominated sport BBC asked fly-on-the-wall it, I jumped chance. Set just outside Cookstown, paddock grassroots get. It essentially field dogs, vans, tents plenty bikes, you immediately struck overwhelming friendliness family vibe comes hardened bunch riders. The place lit smiles I instantly felt adopted. For weekend I gang. They let in, family, tent holding story. One starkest aspects seeing close how, amateurs, riders fund cases takes lives. They work full-time rely good-natured bosses odd extra Friday racing. Some bosses it, do, result gets race weekend. Pretty cash goes it. Take Yvonne. She wo nails equates fuel. It kinds choices riders making follow passion. But truth, turned probably extraordinary thing Yvonne. When I met her, leathers waiting class. She races 400cc 600cc bikes crew consists friend. Incredibly, had turned wheel bike 47, taking following break-up marriage. Within year racing. That 13 years ago celebrates 60th birthday August. I know wo mind headlining this; she adamant older you running time. It hard argue that. Not cross word Yvonne, soft Irish lilt enchanting personality. I addicted, says. She happiest been. Yvonne reminds someone: Valentino Rossi. The nine-times world champion racing addict. He loves winning. It lives for. He Yvonne leagues apart ways identical comes force drives them. To race bike, discipline, passionate want it. That passion evident paddock Cookstown. It could different MotoGP set-up Mugello rolling Tuscan hills comes backdrop facilities, equally matched desire love racing.

Of course it dangerous, motor sport is, road racing comes special danger. The roads narrow walls close, equally provides thrill choose lucky watch action. Suzi Perry Queens Road shown Monday 7.30pm BBC One There better time honest review flawed victory. England win belts Bangladesh 6pm Thursday reassuringly straightforward. But earlier disconcerting moments took place match began. The ones came teamsheet. Might Jake Ball new Gary Ballance? These worthy cricketers. But 2015 World Cup selection out-of-form Ballance England match came personify insecure safety-first instincts bedevil (much longer) campaign. At Oval pitch brown, true slow. There pace bowlers, England chose Ball preferred Adil Rashid. This hinted lack self-belief, which, fair, characteristic Eoin Morgan clear-sighted regime calamitous World Cup. This surprise Rashid selected 41 England past 44 ODI matches. The conditions demanded variety battery right-handed pace bowlers plus Moeen Ali. For England important match 45 ODIs, declined pick wrist-spinner. (Mind you, Bangladesh equally cautious deciding omit specialist spinner, Mehedi Hasan, gave England roasting Tests winter) So suggested England absolute faith Rashid, who, according self-effacing spin partner, Moeen, has variations likely wicket-taker. Morgan keeps telling chasing wickets: record Moeen 47 55 matches, Rashid 63 46. However, preference Ball Rashid probably reflected greater lack faith fitness England bowlers, subsequently justified. Ben Stokes attention necessity compelled propel seven overs Thursday. But Chris Woakes, missed England ODIs, manage just left strained, overs bowl Champions Trophy. Was Woakes compensating delivery stride recent thigh problem? We know. Now Ball legitimate selection. Perhaps element wish fulfilment England assessment fitness Stokes Woakes. They England engine room, all-rounders near peak; vital players long inked best side. Why desperate play? This yearning stretches Andrew Strauss, England cricket director, gave pair permission extended stay Indian Premier League. They choices teams, unlike Morgan Jason Roy, kept busy. Both adamant Indian experience enhanced cricketers. But battling bodies. Is merely unlucky coincidence? Something Strauss ponder. That wish fulfilment extend Roy, reached double figures (when scoring 20 Ireland Lord) ODIs summer. Morgan faith Roy admirable absolute  hinted picking Surrey opener tournament come may. However, faith indefinitely; soon border superstition. To replace Roy Jonny Bairstow (albeit inexperienced opener) Ballance moment betraying loss faith England oft-quoted positive approach. Bairstow different technique Roy approach similar. To use couple old-fashioned adjectives, seldom used now, strong stable. Against better attacks Bangladesh, England need quota batsmen bowlers likely conjure wickets true tracks. In tournament cricket short-term goals prevail; showing faith consistent backing chosen men way picking bloke likely score runs point. Roy rope extend New Zealand game remains trough. Still, England produced better performance encountered Bangladesh ICC tournament Adelaide (defeat 15 runs early flight home 2015). It trickier Cardiff Tuesday Kiwis. Surely Antipodeans Edgbaston denied victory rain Friday. New Zealand undaunted playing noisy neighbours unlikely overawed prospect facing England. Against Australia, tossed Luke Ronchi, wildcard, opening batsman; Kane Williamson tournament second centurion Joe Root  cream coming surface  brief period field trio pace bowlers demonstrated benefits bowling genuine hostility start. They compromising modern, aggressive approach. The Edgbaston result means victory England Group A  Kiwis Australia Saturday  allow Morgan passage semifinals. In spring 2005, postcards arrived. They ready, cards read, are you? Soon after, wristbands came, sent special delivery. They Power Four written them, which, turned out, official motto 2005 British & Irish Lions tour. It Clive Woodward grand plan. Woodward spent 12 months scheming no apologies believing best-prepared tour history Lions rugby. The card sent What The Fuck Is Going On? written front, if feel like meeting, hold card  overleaf. It turned useful lot. Within months, Woodward hard-earned reputation shot, Lions whitewashed time tours. Between them, Ian McGeechan Warren Gatland spent lot time past 12 years unpicking mistakes Woodward putting Lions again. Even now, Gatland says Lions mission New Zealand summer to mend stuff 2005, wants squad to engage community, play good rugby, public side, great tourists. All things failed 12 years ago. Woodward picked 44 players 28 support staff, including 10 coaches, legal adviser, referee and, course, Alastair Campbell head media relations. His attention remorseless, said Gareth Thomas. The players given iPods loaded specially chosen songs, including Lions' new anthem. Woodward expected learn words time arrived New Zealand. McGeechan, assistant coach, felt Woodward overlooked thing. I kept asking Clive going talk rugby, going sit say: This going beat All Blacks.' First, Lions play Argentina, match arranged help cover 10m cost tour. The training sessions game interrupted series classes seminars. We working questionable lineouts, recalled Lewis Moody. The session interrupted midway attend meeting Alastair Campbell, discuss deal media. So 48 hours taking Pumas unprepared team working desperately hard perfect set-piece told attend media studies. There team-building class, squad co-operated painting. There fair grumbling, Campbell wrote dairy, but thing done, painted giant mural logo sense wanted tour be. It actually pretty breathtaking. He impressed. Donncha O'Callaghan was. It basically colour numbers. It me. I draw rhino corner canvas I stuck cigarette mouth. There are, O'Callaghan felt, ways bond new group players. Neither involved murals. Let kick shit training field let piss night. Eddie O'Sullivan thought tour felt like three-ring circus. McGeechan diplomatic. He described a brave attempt update Lions. Either way, agreed Moody verdict Lions drawn Argentina, 25-25 Jonny Wilkinson kicked penalty final minute. I trudged pitch, Tests looming All Black fire, Moody wrote. I could help think: Fuck, going difficult'. The Lions won game tour, Bay Plenty, lost Lawrence Dallaglio, flew home injured. He player felt tour already. Some guys hard job playing team, I did luxury, wrote Ronan O'Gara. By half-time, O'Gara sure tour done. Why? Because I missed tackles. O'Gara suspected Woodward mind team long got New Zealand. His poor performance opening half easy leave Irish fly-half out. Woodward said no way dissect tour party separate groups. But exactly did. This before, Brian O'Driscoll wrote diary. Soon we why. The midweek team, coached McGeechan, adopted Travis Driftwood anthem  We driftwood, floating Lions, play Tuesdays, Tuesdays. On 11 June, Lions lost New Zealand Maori 19-13. It Shane Williams game tour. I got absolutely battered, Williams wrote. I remember thinking afterwards: My God, I hope games are physical this.' Panic began set in. The coaches picked the guts Saturday team play Wellington following Wednesday. After that, O'Callaghan wrote, it obvious lot fellas XV Test picked, probably we'd left home. In run-up Test, midweek players locked video analysis room. What think going do? Sell secrets All Blacks? O'Callaghan asked. There element paranoia place uncomfortable. The Lions surrounded training ground 8ft tall fence. Before session, security remove group schoolchildren ground. We came arrogant, McGeechan thought, and All Blacks country desperate beaten. Meanwhile, Williams felt too chiefs. The coaches kept chopping changing session next, different people giving different messages. Wales won Grand Slam spring, playing different way England team won World Cup years earlier, difference epitomised fly-halves, Stephen Jones Wilkinson. I just won Grand Slam Wales wanted attack play anywhere, Jones wrote, while Jonny won World Cup England playing mistake-free rugby strengths great pack. Unable pick other, coaches chose both, Jones fly-half Wilkinson inside centre. Which meant leaving Gavin Henson. According Thomas, Campbell hamfisted attempt manage fall-out. He distributed misleading quotes Henson, arranged to hidden photographer shots Clive Gav, knowledge, errant impression well. Campbell, Thomas said, had parachuted world different parameters principles struggled nuances rugby dressing room. The coaches' paranoia peaked days Test, convinced junk team lineout calls worried spies. The upshot, Matt Dawson recalled, we went game complex set calls I known, complex players did understand them. Two days Test supposedly best organised Lions tours, knew ball going. One thing Lions nailed handle haka. Woodward sought advice Maori elder. We spread half-moon shape, leader youngest member, Dwayne Peel, standing me, recalled Brian O'Driscoll. When haka ends, I pull grass throw them, pulling ground underneath feet. Dawson, substitute day, remembered the All Blacks look expression does suggest gratitude respect believe just paid heritage. Forty seconds match, O'Driscoll charged ruck. The All Blacks' hooker, Keven Mealamu, grabbed left leg All Blacks captain, Tana Umaga, came right. Together hoisted O'Driscoll tipped over. O'Driscoll stuck arm break fall, broke shoulder too. Eleven minutes later, Paul O'Connell, pumped specially brewed energy drink, sent sin-bin, seven minutes Richard Hill wrecked anterior cruciate ligament, carried join O'Driscoll. The game soon Thomas called the damage limitation exercise hell. The conditions atrocious, wrote Jason Robinson, the rain falling horizontally blowing gale. Thomas as cold I rugby field. My hands numb I single thought frozen brain: Let here, assess are.' Inside, Wilkinson desperate. We cannon fodder. It helpless. I frustrated fired up. I start looking big hits everywhere, not, try change game. I do know going achieve anything. It time felt helpless rugby field. The Lions lost 21-3. In aftermath, wanted talk injury O'Driscoll. The Lions liked way. Campbell showed reporters video footage incident slow-mo. The citing officer decided Mealamu Umaga wrong, ban Danny Grewcock biting Mealamu. From point end trip topic conversation Brian treated responsible got away it, Dawson said. Every day briefed say. It encompassing distraction. McGeechan felt Lions seemed lose moral high ground dispute Campbell came stream statements interviews. O'Driscoll gave press conference early morning. I do possess equanimity pounding like say nothing, game. Because is, wrote. I deliberate foul play, dangerous, cheap shot. His team-mates agreed. It awful, unforgiveable, duly swept carpet, Thomas wrote. It worst home-town decisions I seen. Thomas took captain. He felt Lions derided as bunch spineless whingers, Woodward decision bring refereeing consultant legal adviser spawned accusations arrogance. Campbell war wall negative cuttings motivate players. But days wall overflowing taken down. Under pressure, Thomas worried the natural cracks fissures starting show. And fact player room making worse. Their rooms bunkers almost, wrote O'Sullivan. Before tour, joke problem Lions suffer loneliness. But Paul O'Connell loneliest experiences career. He holed own, started smoking. Until tour I had smoked years. I brushing teeth seven times day: I wanted brush away smell smoke. I was getting lot tour I remember thinking benefit over. At I white teeth end fucking trip. Morale flatlined Woodward allowed Campbell team talk. For reasons known Alastair, thinks good idea compare tour duty soldiers Iraq, recalled Dawson. He suggests lack desire tries use example theatre war situation perspective. As O'Connell recalled it, Campbell told campaign crisis, comes moment people realise need dig deep he did feeling looking us. He did sense fighting back. Everyone expression disbelief. I getting angry inside, Dawson wrote. At end bristling. According O'Sullivan: You heard pin drop. The speech lunacy. The morning, O'Connell stewing it. I decided I going session over: Alastair Campbell knock out. There would need questions explanations. Everyone know for. Thomas tried bring team way. They called Captain Clean Off. As clean head. A lot guys countries, Williams reckoned, probably had experienced leadership like lives. During particularly bleak training session day second Test, Thomas called huddle. Just got words sum situation present: Do fucking panic, said. He waited beat, realised, Shit, that is it?' Unfortunately, Thomas it, I lost count score following day. He scored try second Test, and, Williams it, for couple minutes, felt beatable. The All Blacks won 48-18. It did feel like collective loss, wrote O'Callaghan. Nobody thinking giant painting Vale Glamorgan unity supposed bring. Thomas went postal launched himself a post-match bender resulted two-day hangover. The midweek team, meanwhile, won game. But success make worse. Thomas heard midweek players were resentful rewarded shot Test series. O'Callaghan pointedly observed a feeling unity togetherness group was reflected results. McGeechan felt Lions become not. Moody agreed. Clive treated like business, well-oiled machine, wrote, but old school methods, degree, essential Lions tour. Not bought that. O'Sullivan, eye job 2009 tour, sick hearing it. The Midweek Massive myth, reckoned O'Sullivan. Bullshit. They beating teams amounted little Kathy Berry XV trying hold kind higher calling Test side. To me, toxic tour went on. I said people. The Wednesday beat likes Manawatu 103 points celebrate kind Herculean deed. It certainly nearer Test team managed. They lost game 38-19. In end, Moody reckoned, I felt pub team getting hammered. Woodward gave bizarre final press conference, said it actually successful tour, great experience. After that, team left New Zealand drips drabs, team, wrote Thomas. There heartfelt goodbyes, reaffirmations faith. But was, Williams wrote, a real sense relief tour over. Each man opinion gone wrong. I do think stood chance, thought Dawson. Williams wrote: We answer threw us, shedload skill physicality, pride I previously encountered. There way going allow British & Irish Lions team come territory win. O'Connell closest mark said we came excellent team needed be. The thing agreed that, Thomas it, all wristbands postcards world could prepare intensity it.

Zidane described Madrid second-half performance spectacular thrilled club won Spanish title European Cup season time 1958. Incredibly, Madrid 12th European Cup total. You say today historic day Madrid fans, players myself, Zidane said. I feel extremely happy truth it special year, could dream better. We won league day know it difficult win Champions League final second year running  we managed it. Ronaldo, given man-of-the-match award Sir Alex Ferguson, pointed list staggering career statistics reminded people criticised recent past suggested that, age 32, feels good done. What important I again, amazing season, team-mates won double, said Ronaldo, scored 108 goals Champions League. I think people do words criticise numbers do lie. I happy, it best moments career  I say year. My head just number. I feel like young boy. Zidane, presided back-to-back Champions League successes, admitted Madrid struggled half, Juventus played shortage belief. We started difficulties I think second half clearly superior, Madrid coach said. We kept ball, pressured higher physically I think won game determination showed. It turned chastening night Juventus, lost seven European Cup finals succession. Massimiliano Allegri, Juventus manager, admitted players unable respond mentally Madrid regained lead recognised difference Ronaldo big occasion again. In half played beautifully, Allegri said. In second half Real Madrid pushed accelerator remained static sat long. We knew playing strong team. It obvious somebody wins Ballon d'Or scores goals it big advantage Real Madrid. The criticism I make players conceding second goal stayed game mentally try solutions equalise could that. Asked end era Juventus players, Allegri replied: No, I do think Juventus reached end cycle. [Gianluigi] Buffon Juventus goalkeeper year, Andrea Barzagli us. These players lot give. Australian grand slam tennis great Margaret Court says US gay lobby conspiring strip Australian Open stadium. Court, 74, Christian pastor, criticised condemnation same-sex marriage saying tennis lesbians. Another grand slam champion, Martina Navratilova, says Court revealed herself homophobe stadium renamed Evonne Goolagong honour. Navratilova, lesbian herself, point  there disputing Court making bizarre remarks, making reference Nazis. Nor does Court realise gay lobby means people refuse tolerate homophobia, that going include heterosexuals, too. The comment tennis full lesbians says  hear complaining sport heterosexuals? How young sporty girls, sexuality, supposed deal this? It said Wimbledon tournament faced calls ban Court attending year (she is). In light events, needs anyway. Just thought man it about, man it about. In buildup final, Casemiro insisted he plug holes, claiming robbing ball, scoring goals, brings pleasure, just reached higher plane, thumping shot Real Madrid lead looked set bring night Cardiff close. Three minutes later, though, man stepped centre-stage. Him, again. Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro. Never write off, say it over. Do laugh says wants play 40; listen instead. He decides ends. This season, season, past 30, decided ends too. In Cardiff, ended way 59 years: Real Madrid champions Spain Europe. Although Marco Asensio added late fourth, Ronaldo second moment Madrid knew team defend Champions League. As Luka Modric went right just hour, Ronaldo dashed near post and, ball came him, steered time past Gianluigi Buffon. Ronaldo kept running, heading corner Casemiro occupied just moments before, fans chanting: This Real Madrid win. Recently, too, before. Ronaldo opened scoring; second, taking 12, European Cup Madrid won, making player score finals. It competition scorer sixth time. That appropriate, long appeared impossible. Some wondered possible again. How foolish were. Unknown most, happened seek continuity. In August, Zinedine Zidane spoke Ronaldo. The moment perfect, elements contributing: Ronaldo just European champion Portugal injured. For seasons, struggled finish line, coach wanted avoid. Zidane devised plan; presented it. Here Millennium Stadium, plan came together. Zidane convinced Ronaldo rest, rotation, protecting peak important games. It allow 32-year-old prolong career. Ronaldo step occasionally months passed process accelerated. Of Madrid final seven away games league, Ronaldo sat four. It worked. At time here, named man match, European Cup winner time Madrid. He image finals, sure, truth decisive, here. We intelligent, Ronaldo say. I saving myself: games titles decided. When played, decided. He just goals competition, autumn, Madrid headed quarter-final Bayern Munich. By time arrived here, 10. He left trophy. Two hat-tricks goals scored games Germans Atltico, Juventus. He scored goal clinched Madrid league title years, sixth final games. Ronaldo evolved, No9, striker movement honed. With passing year, stats confirm sensations: dribbling less, covering distance. But astute deadly: season taken fewer shots goal before. The opener example: once, striker slipped ball wide burst area; time, striker, slipping wide showing return. Carvajal cutback hit, like Ronaldo goals, time. He leapt drew arms, does  celebration seen often, copied five-year-olds everywhere. One destined repeated got second. Like first, turned time. Another night, final, goal. More astonishing, impressive, previous nights. His best end career barely believable. More records falling: player reach 100 goals Champions League competition scorer record sixth time. This different, though. Different better. This Ronaldo worst goalscoring season seven years. The thing is, worst pretty else best  seasons scored 51, 61, 51, 55, 60 53 goals, 41st  there fact year quality quantity. It simply goals Ronaldo scores matters, them, goals. Bayern, Atltico, Juventus. Quarters, semis, final. It felt like moment gone moment arrived he. Him again. 6 Gianluigi Buffon Unlucky deflections goals similarly scant chance others.

There better test painful place earth lose. This applies bit provincial matches looming Test series. Woe betide naive Lions anticipating low-key midweek hit-out uninterested Kiwi opposition stuff begins. Even cursory glance 2017 itinerary induces shiver spine. Starting Wednesday game Blues Auckland, Lions face toughest midweek schedule compiled. The Highlanders Dunedin, Chiefs Hamilton Hurricanes Wellington successive Tuesday nights directly Saturday fixtures Crusaders, Maori All Blacks New Zealand? Brutal does begin it. When Warren Gatland midweek Wales played Chiefs year home team romped 40-7 victory. Gatland himself key member Waikato team thumped 1993 Lions 38-10. Small wonder set feature Blues Eden Park sense difference intensity compared early stages 2013 tour Australia. You just sense organisation, says Conor Murray, outstanding Irish scrum-half preparing form new half-back partnership current room-mate Dan Biggar. There air place there bigger coming years ago. That way needs All Blacks better Australia were. I think coaches, players staff aware it going lot tougher  it going hell weeks. If upside long coming: selectors swiftly cut it. Murray, started 2013 tour Mike Phillips pecking order, suspects competition Test places fiercer normal result. Last time round feeling Test team couple weeks I do think case time. I think we going push right week announcement Test team. Maybe Warren lads ideas heads combinations people want play it just tight probably come goes better midweek games weekend games leading Test. There air red-hot competition great. The impressive Munster No9 slim-priced favourite make first-choice XV, having Ireland guiding light autumn victory All Blacks Chicago. Strong dextrous, confident approachable, 28-year-old hallmarks key Test Lion presuming nothing: I think it OK say want Test starter, want play Tests, they games remembered. But it going really tough team. I think squad massively talented ... Test team pick incredible. Jonathan Sexton prominent hoping fit-again Murray comes steaming blocks; all-Irish half-back pairing opening Test help save Gatland precious training ground time. If Owen Farrell Biggar end 10 instead, instant connection established demanding circumstances. It necessarily looking videos, Murray says. It just spending time chatting guys, getting understand game rugby. Sporting telepathy tends plucked air. Knowing Sexton does, Murray expects plenty straight talking training pitch tour progresses. I talking Dan it. All fly-halves pretty fiery really competitive. You guys want win time standards are upheld let known they happy. It interesting happens. I sure barking orders weeks. There certainly time Murray Munster team-mates Peter O'Mahony CJ Stander dwell disappointing Pro12 final defeat Scarlets. If suspicions long, uniquely emotional season just caught them, unavailable pre-tour training camps Wales Ireland urged set recent past aside. We spoken harsh nature tour, Murray says. For 11 guys involved finals it just catching up. You straight looking goal group players had lost final ca afford feel sorry yourself. For midweek dirt-trackers Test contenders alike, respite Wednesday onwards. If cap week banned, Dylan Hartley veteran, 60. As is, England captain  barring injury, Lions call-up or, perish thought, suspension  win caps 85 86. Had good boy, 100-plus now. And Lion, certainly 2013, possibly now. Regrets? No, says, quietly firmly. It does define me. I OK it. It hard square notion serial offender thoughtful amusing interviewee Hartley been. But reputation, could, maybe should, England captain career. He relishing chance play role England young squad two-Test tour Argentina wo thought Lions. There point dreaming thinking it. All focus game [next Saturday]. I do want sidetracked maybes. I setbacks. You just learn say OK on. I drew line [the Lions] straight away. His record England captain enviable interwoven remarkable unbeaten run Eddie Jones opened term coach. Jones Hartley enjoy certain chemistry, hookers, feisty, unconventional intelligent. That relationship earned Hartley opportunity play way form rarely extended players level. The irony finally awarded captaincy just status England best hooker came threat, just injuries started bite. If length season cause concern, Hartley relatively fresh form disrupted campaign. He played 80 minutes week, unusual front-row forward. I it, says grin. Just chance. He set continue captaincy foreseeable future, subject usual provisos. There changes I do better. It hands, Eddie clear me. Next Tests, San Juan Santa Fe, Argentina, England start  Lions tour 2009. As ever, Argentina challenge Hartley department, row, days just adept running game. Regular wins remain elusive Super Rugby side, Jaguares, benefit familiarity England, just like Lions, frantically trying engineer. England build core experience, led Hartley Chris Robshaw, Danny Care Mike Brown, young players introduced. Nevertheless, Jones insisted recent training eclipsed Six Nations. It youngsters, says Hartley. They driving it. Before came camp knew expectation certainly delivering. I rang them. I got lot yes sir' thank sir' Curry boys. I worked old afterwards. The twins Sale turn 19 Tests. Ben picked bench Barbarians game Sunday pull out, Tom stepped up, came early man match. No knows twin which, knows lot players. It certainly new dynamic Hartley appears love grown-up middle all. It ended, does, familiar smile. Cristiano Ronaldo  gelled hair, dazzling teeth, magic boots  forget night scored 600th goal implausible career. It moment knew Champions League trophy way Bernabu and, again, four-times Ballon d'Or winner left imprint final. Ronaldo scored twice exultant night leapfrogged Lionel Messi announce himself competition leading scorer fifth season running. He enjoy that, too, real prize lifted European football coveted silverware times seasons. Cardiff 2017 fit neatly Milan 2016 Lisbon 2014 whereas, Juventus, familiar story regret hurt. This seventh defeat finals, including row, second half chastening experience Serie A champions, culminating sieving goals match rest competition together. It full-on collapse and, end, players black white stripes looked need smelling salts. It certainly rare Juventus team lose way badly bearing mind 1-1 break and, anything, Massimiliano Allegri players looked rounded side. Yet second half dreadful ordeal team Turin supporters held thousands black white cards kick-off spell: The Time Now. Yes, Juve unfortunate, extreme, deflected goal Casemiro gave Madrid 2-1 lead just hour. From point onwards, however, staggering team renowned defensive structure crumple way. Juve indignities period featured sending-off Juan Cuadrado, substitutes, late goal Marco Asensio thousands Madridistas going victory songs. Gareth Bale, deemed short fitness start, joined party stage Zinedine Zidane team really care game outstanding moment conjured losing players. Mario Mandzukic goal paradox night. Indeed, better goal European final? Zidane himself all-time list spearing volley Bayer Leverkusen Hampden Park 2002. Yet legitimate debate Mandzukic 27th-minute effort edge given involved ball going different players touching floor. Leonardo Bonucci long, diagonal pass Alex Sandro left and, that, blur exhilarating speed, colour movement. Sandro cross pick Gonzalo Higuan beauty: cushioned, left-footed volley run. Higuan controlled ball chest flicked Mandzukic. And then, finally, big man turn, teeing himself twisting body launch himself ball. Volley, chest-volley, chest-volley: touches total, mid-air; left, right, left right again. It like game and, end it, Mandzukic improvisational shot dipping swerving corner Keylor Navas goal. Ultimately, though, prosaic goals carried greater significance contest. Madrid managed clean sheet way winning competition. Yet statistic Zidane team player, anyone, carries team dreams. They arrived Cardiff best goals record competition  32 12 ties  Ronaldo, Ronaldo, rarely lets big game pass making kind contribution. To begin with, difficult ball Juve penalty area. But periods finals drifted edges. Then reached 20th minute came alive, exchanging passes overlapping Dani Carvajal pulling right boot aim. His shot low, directed corner, skimmed Bonucci elude Gianluigi Buffon. If kind losing side, Madrid goals came deflections and, Casemiro case, trajectory shot completely changed ball struck Sami Khedira. The truth, however, Juve, having conceded goals en route final, chose bad night lose defensive organisation recovered moment. Three minutes later, Luka Modric scampered right, clipped cross near post Ronaldo clipped finish gave remainder match air inevitability. The people criticise Cristiano going guitar case, said afterwards, modest ever. There time Sergio Ramos, devious bag weasels, help engineer Cuadrado second yellow card bout pretend agony Madrid second-half performance lot good bad. Marcelo set Asensio sweep fourth goal minute Zidane joined Brian Clough, Sir Alex Ferguson, Pep Guardiola Jos Mourinho list managers won European Cup twice.

The value Adam Lyth century, surely hardest-fought 22 first-class cricket, seen celebration; having spent 41 balls 16 overs 71 minutes hanging nineties, involuntarily leaped air completing single. The ball faced, drained 234-ball stay, produced truly loose shot, caught driving. But Lyth, highest score season 30, chiselled Yorkshire Roses dominance: innings lead 150, potent seam attack capitalised on, dismissing Lancashire cheaply. In way stand Shiv Chanderpaul Dane Vilas, shared sprightly 60 late day. Still, Lancashire face battle save game, heartened Monday rotten forecast. A measure Lyth innings quality batsman pass 40 Chanderpaul. Lyth played totally type man normally stylish gallivanting. With Lancashire bowling  82 overs delivered seamers  easy away defensive line favourable conditions, care required Lyth obliged. Lancashire badly missed Jimmy Anderson, emerged stumps sprints, England increasingly optimistic fit summer Test. Yorkshire lost Gary Ballance, 600th run season ticked off, Ryan McLaren funereal morning but, lunch approaching, Saqib Mahmood, pick bowlers, wickets balls  Jack Leaning caught brilliantly second slip Tim Bresnan nicking first. Lancashire bowling improved Lyth rightly watchful, Andy Hodd, Azeem Rafiq Jack Brooks provided lower order roister. Jordan Clark, dismissed Lyth, ended wickets, like Mahmood.

Hameed high, 26 runs innings. Three ducks, 10 highest score torrid sequence. Runs badly needed Middlesex week. At stage Lancashire liked services Liam Livingstone, spent day smashing South Africa A Northampton, 83-ball 129.

It undoubtedly exaggeration suggest Wigan season crisis just yet, increasingly clear reigning Super League champions running excuses and, importantly, fixtures. The Warriors gone games win latest defeat, Super 8s follow later summer, fact Shaun Wane closer makes remaining fixtures split essential remain touch leading pack. Wigan certainly injury problems aplenty, fact lost captain, Sean O'Loughlin, pre-match certainly help  recent performances concerning mitigation unconvincing. Hull came fixture problems, key personnel run consecutive defeats; far good Warriors here, moving completing double Wigan Super League. To credit, Warriors improved immensely half-time 26-4 damage done, point lost Wane afterwards. We just left second half, said. We played poorly. It tries apiece better team. It big game Leigh week. There Hull tries half, including winger Steve Michaels, occasions brutally exposed Wigan deficiencies defence. Wigan opening half summed moment madness forward Willie Isa, tripped Mark Minichiello concede penalty Jake Connor kicked ease open 22-point lead interval. Perhaps crumb comfort Wigan half survived 10-minute period Liam Farrell relatively unscathed, England international sent sin-bin dissent. After half-time improved, hour reduced gap 12 courtesy tries Liam Marshall Lewis Tierney. With Wigan top, need special quell hope comeback, Hull full-back Jamie Shaul provided instinctive chip, chase regather end Wigan revival Albert Kelly secured victory long-range effort. Late tries Marshall, Tom Davies Joe Burgess mere consolations beaten. Against odds year, Wane produced best players injury-hit Wigan Old Trafford, win title full-stop. If season, rank greater achievement given currently themselves. The troubled passage endured Derby Wings Of Eagles mirrored previously troubled career journeyman jockey, Padraig Beggy, feared days saddle banned year Australia end 2014. Entertaining company, manifestly talented rider, Beggy talked way additional trouble positive test cocaine, providing false explanations accepting deliberately taken drug.

Batting posted solid-looking 299, driven effortlessly fine Hashim Amla, 25th one-day internationals, high-class batsman showing value reading pitch accumulating care. It amazing innings, AB Villiers, captain, said. He really assess conditions, quite lot wicket early on. In reply Sri Lanka hauled mid-chase fine, aggressive spell leg-spin ever-exuberant Imran Tahir, bowler greets wicket, dragged-down mishit deep cover, wildly joyful sprint, like man fleeing burning building simultaneously hearing news million-pound jackpot win. Tahir took 27 bowled accuracy aggressive variation. If South Africa batting really fire, bowling looks plenty edge fielded vim. De Villiers spoke length need calmness intensity. Tahir qualifies these, De Villiers rated performance close 10 10. To make things worse Sri Lanka dawdling rate punished uncontested two-match ban stand-in captain, Upul Tharanga, team overs short end South Africa innings. All players lose 60% match fees, too. The regular captain, Angelo Mathews, debilitating twangs strains. Tharanga won toss bowled, fearful nibble air sunny south London morning dark clouds skudding overhead end-of-the-world thunderstorms previous day. His bowlers tight early on. Lasith Malinga time year half mixed tight lines wides tosses, able dip odd ball batsman toes. The feisty Quinton Kock becalmed, eventually nicking Nuwan Pradeep fiddling outside stump. Faf du Plessis dropped slapstick fashion Malinga, dithering top-edged pull. After ran hard reach 50 52 balls, facing ordinary change bowers. In team entire Sri Lanka top-six moonlight wicketkeepers, depriving Tharanga usual strong hand fill-ins part-time dart merchants. Amla eased along, lifting Asela Gunaratne mid-off, cuffing slapping short square sides. He little obscured De Villiers Virat-Kane-Joe rat pack Amla record bears comparison these. Only Virat Kohli ODI hundreds averaging 50. De Villiers appeared briefly spooning catch midwicket wild, splay-footed pull flat short Seekkuge Prasanna. Chris Morris biffed usefully. JP Duminy spanked ball innings groundsman shed. But South Africa looked little short. Sri Lanka fine lineage spiky little wicketkeeper-batsmen Niroshan Dickwella set decent lick reply, walloping Wayne Parnell cover punting Kagiso Rabada high midwicket. For Sri Lanka attacked chase hunger Dickwella winkled Morne Morkel 41. At point moments brilliance field killed game. First De Villiers took standing jump catch Kusal Mendis midwicket hand just ball cleared him. This soon AB double, captain hurling stumps run Dinesh Chandimal. Three balls later Chamara Kapugedera lbw ball Tahir excellent googly, greatest fate international batsman. At halfway point Sri Lanka 154 target. At point Tahir turned screw. Tharanga, play tournament reach semi-finals, completed fluent half-century caught, playing pointless lofted drive David Miller deep cover, sparking excitement bowler probably produce competitive time world indoor 60m heats starter gun synchronised successful lbw appeal. With went Sri Lanka best hopes match ended rush. It used said trainer felt potential Derby winners stable truth one. But more. Aidan O'Brien sent horses Classic left Epsom empty-handed six-strong team Saturday produced 40-1 winner Wings Of Eagles, colt just handful backers countless thousands crammed Downs. The victory Wings Of Eagles biggest surprise Derby Snow Knight success 50-1 1974, horse double-figure price High-Rise 20-1 1998. On day, however, fluke it, Wings Of Eagles Padraig Beggy hit strides line, won shade cosily end. There echoes Pour Moi charge field victory 2011 son Wings Of Eagles passed horse horse Epsom straight, building momentum time closing steadily leaders. Two furlongs out, though, eyes glued stable companion, Cliffs Of Moher, O'Brien principal jockey Ryan Moore, glided past market rival Cracksman useful lead. The stage set Cliffs Of Moher stride clear simply stayed quickening race reached climax, Wings Of Eagles Beggy chased claimed victory three-quarters length. Before race, questioned O'Brien apparent wish run three-year-old colt pulse Saturday Classic. A minutes later, wisdom covering possible base unarguable, Wings Of Eagles fulfilled promise pedigree, family 1995 Derby winner Lammtarra dam complement Pour Moi. This O'Brien fourth Derby success years sixth all, Sir Michael Stoute (current) total 1981 2010, just all-time record seven wins Classic. All trainers saddle seven winners  Robert Robson, John Porter Fred Darling  active competitive era, sent final Derby winners 1823, 1899 1941 respectively. O'Brien, though, closing sure catch pass seasons out. The trainer clear Wings Of Eagles seen possible winner beforehand, despite starting price defeat hands Venice Beach, finished 12th, previous start Chester. That said, suspect Cliffs Of Moher prove better horse long term. He working delighted Chester, O'Brien said. Padraig going time produce gave marvellous ride. He added Cliffs Of Moher: I delighted second horse. All really well-bred, good-looking horses, make dramatic improvement race race, knew improved [from trial runs]. I did really know going happen. I thought Ryan horse open improvement, did, Ryan said got just got tired hands. I half-afraid happen, we'd just race. If had run Chester, would here. He came long, sustained run 100 yards just told, lack preparation. Michael Tabor, bookmaker co-owners Wings Of Eagles John Magnier Coolmore Stud syndicate, said felt race runners make step win. We knew Wings Of Eagles mix, that, Tabor said. He proved very, good horse future I afraid I did I did bet race. The betting suggested open Derbys years fact 40-1 chance crossed line does necessarily mean sub-par renewal. That apparent remaining starts, career plays out, Wings Of Eagles Beggy Derby winners, change that. Virat Kohli moved quell growing talk rift India players head coach, Anil Kumble, eve hugely anticipated Champions Trophy opener Pakistan Edgbaston, insisting no problems whatsoever. Kumble, wrist-spinner national team captain, told re-apply position current one-year term expires end tournament and, despite 19 wins defeats formats time, change afoot. The team, according reports India, told administrators running country embattled cricket board Kumble style overbearing players Sachin Tendulkar, Sourav Ganguly VVS Laxman, comprise three-man panel overseeing appointment, sort truth conjecture. Kohli, India captain, previously said process different occurred past side meeting Pakistan  rare encounter given bilateral ties currently hold  focus remained Kumble. There problems whatsoever, said Kohli. As I mentioned before, place process, I do people creating speculations it. The team totally focused Champions Trophy. Asked relationship head coach, Kohli said: It really good. The journey good. The situation helped week Ramachandra Guha, Committee Administrators runs Indian cricket, resigned letter explaining reasons  published ESPNCricinfo  raised issue problems current set-up. Guha criticised way Kumble future left hanging contract renewed automatically questioned players belief having veto subject another example superstar culture gone berserk. The state affairs adds extra layer intrigue start India title defence begins neighbours  won past encounters global tournaments  Pakistan head coach, Mickey Arthur, looked sidestep. That India problem, said Arthur, captain, Sarfraz Ahmed, sitting him. All I know captain/coach relationship like marriage. You got page time. And you page correct decisions clarity team. I privilege working good captains time Saffy right I really going enjoy working with, terms relationship going forward. Andy Murray enjoys experiences proving people wrong stubborn man tennis goes second week French Open eighth time 10 visits ringing endorsement rival beat there, Juan Martn del Potro. There plenty people start week feared Scot form fitness low ebb chance reaching final second year row, diminished prospects getting past quarter-finals. He quite yet, fourth round again, deservedly beating occasionally inspired Argentinian misleading score 7-6 (10-8), 7-5, 6-0 just hours mild pleasant afternoon Court Philippe Chatrier, long rain arrived. Del Potro, making appearance years wretched time injury, said 10th encounter, second finish straight sets: It good battle. The sets [took] hours half, really long sets. Andy, he smart court. He shots, great mentally. That he No1 world I know important tournament him. I wish best and, hopefully, far. A players Tour bother compliments. But Del Potro man apart, encouraging genuine warmth crowd fought tigerish intent bring best Murray. Del Potro won set blistering forehand tie-break tiny margin chair umpire conferred line judge awarding point set Murray. The second frame just intense Murray gradually got upper hand Del Potro, painkillers groin strain picked match Nicols Almagro days before. He use excuse said played pain free, clear moving wished. Partly identified Murray court intelligence. There artful exchanges wonderful players difficult pick winning shot arrive. Murray concentrated keeping balls away opponent lethal forehand could, then, having peppered flank, used open court tease drop shots. Del Potro hardly surprised strategy and, slicing backhand returns point going, ran shots unleash forehand. He struck 16 clean winners shot, final set, came went 28 minutes. Fighting end, however, Murray save break points completing bagel. Murray understandably good spirits  little unsettled mood time, win lose. The self-absorption youth long gone, odd on-court explosion still. He said couple outbursts second match, Martin Klizan Thursday, struggles contain emotions. Perhaps bad thing, though. If totally true nature create confusion undermine state game head. He here, just fleeting curse admonishment box, Ivan Lendl sat customary state expressionless concentration. By standards year ago, launched extraordinary assault Novak Djokovic No 1 world ranking time, under-performed. He arrived having lost early tournaments excellent lower-rated opponents Dominic Thiem (Barcelona), Albert Ramos Violas (Monte Carlo), Borna Coric (Madrid) dangerous unpredictable Fabio Fognini (Rome). But Murray clay game improving match. He agreed best 2017 showing. I played good matches beginning year, said, but definitely, clay court season, second sets best I played, sure. He paid scant attention pessimists, mood lifted. He ready raise level notch, really good players matters. He expects better, times before. Last year here, reached final coming close losing matches, went sets. This time, took sets overcome Andrey Kuznetsov Klizan hitting ominous beat Del Potro. To playing early slam easy, positive thing, Murray said. You play good, maybe you little bit switched on. Your focus maybe little bit higher. There moment minor irritation asked shushing himself. He arched eyebrows replied, I do know I doing it. Why does matter? What big deal? I do it. If I say guys ask I saying, I say nothing, ask I do say anything. What want do? What want say? It irrelevant. What relevant happens points. He wrong. The time British players fourth round French Open, Beatles No1 charts Harold Macmillan serving closing months 10 Downing Street. Kyle Edmund, 22, listened From Me You know Supermac was, 22-year-old booming forehand dearly loved match 1963 achievement alongside Andy Murray tournament. For long stretches third-round match Kevin Anderson, Edmund looked like little bit tennis history, resilience tall, powerful South African nearly hours grinding tennis compact Court 2. Anderson, seven places Edmund world rankings 56, outlasted win 6-7 (6-8), 7-6 (7-4), 5-7, 6-1, 6-4 book place 16 US Open champion Marin Cilic, short work Spaniard Feliciano Lpez, win 6-1, 6-3, 6-3. Edmund simultaneously disappointed satisfied, pointing five-setter useful tennis education, especially held physically. Now, says, looking forward Wimbledon, preparation Queen Eastbourne  challenging suggestion surface feel comfortable. I do quite remember saying I do like grass, said ultra-polite way. I just enjoy playing clay hard lot more. Well, I play lot more. So I time them. There little match nearly hours, traded big shots near baseline. Each loaded full-force groundstrokes, averaging shots rally near end match. As Edmund said quick-fire win Renzo Olivo second round: There point having weapons do use them. Jim Courier said performance Edmund potential top-10 player. Apart dip fourth set Saturday, looked worthy assessment. Anderson came life stretch pressure Britain No2, breaks hard come them. Edmund held love-40 3-3 fifth sustain level way end. No matter money have, matter famous are, matter people admire you, know black America tough. LeBron James sat dozens news cameras discuss racist graffiti spray-painted gate house. By time majority news reporters arrived home, offensive language painted over. Some casual observers media coverage thought hoopla word painted gate rich powerful man $21m home bit overdramatic.

The rustiness Lions evident whistle, failed gather kick-off proceeded spend 10 minutes camped half. It remembered, however, scratch side, time prepare. More pertinent Lions' torpor, then, fact arrived New Zealand Wednesday clearly sluggish  thought body  result. Assuming Lions acclimatised Wednesday, far faster start Blues concerning lack intensity, particularly forward pack supposed tourists' biggest advantage. Stuart Hogg fumbling touch inauspicious start butchered overlap Anthony Watson outside looking over. It Johnny Sexton day all. His kicking poor, asking trouble New Zealand, Irish standoff fired rank passes. Bryn Gatland just handful Super Rugby appearances old man given flyhalf displaying composure? Gatland Jr approached contest determined enjoy himself intent showcasing extent kicking repertoire. He Barbarian impress: Sevu Reece caught eye wing, Luteru Laulala full-back, replacement back-row Matt Matich. Many Barbarians parttimers ranks included shop owners, sheep farmers nurses. How comfortable ball, however, showed inbuilt skill set simply does exist northern hemisphere. While abundance, main plus points Lions impact replacements. George Kruis presence felt lineout Owen Farrell upped tempo, missed routine penalty. Mako Vunipola, too, telling turnover  Saracens theme developing  Justin Tipuric ferocious defence. The Lions bit difficulty getting replacements wanted  poor administration afford happen later line  field, bit direction verve tourists' play. There doubting coach Gatland accentuating positives when, straight match, pointing Lions held line times. True, failure convert chances far worrying. Anthony Watson hattrick heads stayed little cooler concerning moment half Greig Laidlaw, admittedly known sniping, missed huge gap Barbarians' props practically ushering through. Laidlaw committed pass worrying clear evidence Lions' muddled thinking. If learn play Tests trouble. Without wishing pleasure misfortune others, perfect weekend All Blacks Steve Hansen anxious injuries sustained Ryan Crotty Ben Smith (left) Crusaders' victory Highlanders. Crotty suffered rib injury and, Crusaders coach, Scott Robertson, it: I think Steve Hansen tucking notebook thinking who next. Smith, meanwhile, suffered concussion big miss All Blacks. Add fact Kieran Read doubtful Test Dane Coles concussion problems continuing Hansen relieved Super Rugby goes hold weekend. Two French outsiders frustrated admirers serial inconsistency, Aliz Cornet Caroline Garcia, meet fourth round home slam wins contrasting style day rain ripped schedule Roland Garros. The unseeded Cornet bigger, quicker win  6-2, 6-1 hour 19 minutes world No10 Agnieszka Radwanska. Garcia, No28 seed, significantly lesser opponent world No109 Hsieh Su-wei  good Johanna Konta round talented American Taylor Townsend second  struggled hours 39 minutes winning 6-4, 4-6, 9-7. That scant consolation Konta, world No8, expected end week. The ever-smiling Cornet said later: I feeling just happy. It lot emotion qualify second week home slam  big relief, also, I beat Aga just maybe matches played. This was, fact, second success elegant Pole attempts, got numbers mattered right. As told French reporters later: Whether I play 10 100 opponent, happen, I do focus numbers. Radwanska collapse major shock answer Cornet fierce determination. I enjoyed time court lot, I stressed match, French player said. Even match, I felt like I beat her. When feeling, focused point. That I did. She just wired Monday match Garcia. The crowd going excited Caro play, French women playing place quarter-final. I think [favour] other, try good show. Garcia said trial Taiwanese star: So games tight end. Even I down, I kept fighting, tried aggressive. The week difficult. It good period learn yourself, team, people you. She know plenty Cornet, course, start underdog given No43 world  unpredictable tournament day one. Also, won previous match: 7-5, 5-7, 6-3 clay Marseille seven years ago.

Warren Gatland insists huge reason panic despite British & Irish Lions' lacklustre start tour New Zealand. The head coach cited jetlag main explanation Lions' unimpressive 13-7 win NZ Provincial Barbarians XV composed largely part-time players believes different story squad spent time new surroundings. The touring team New Zealand Wednesday emerged finding difficult acclimatise. These guys recovering travel, Gatland said. A number players squad have got regular sleep patterns. Andy Farrell went doctor night sleeping pill. He went bed 11 12 o'clock o'clock morning team room could sleep. We just got try recover adjust quickly possible. So hopefully days we going cycle we feeling fresh. Gatland team manager, John Spencer, secret loved time prepare squad. We preferred week UK squad week New Zealand game, said Gatland. Perhaps schedulers need look future tours. None Lions looking make unnecessary excuses preparation opening fixture clearly hopelessly inadequate. In addition late arrival New Zealand, quarter squad involved domestic finals weekend doing community visits necessitated long car journeys. Two players, Ross Moriarty Kyle Sinckler, required treatment spasms Gatland felt largely wedged 4x4 vehicle soon flying in. The squad attend official Maori welcome Waitangi Treaty grounds tomorrow relocating hours south Auckland. Gatland, however, encouraged efforts Ben Te'o, Taulupe Faletau replacements Lions fought 7-3 half-time. We learned lot terms tough come New Zealand motivated teams going us. That game going good stead. When I look years ago played Barbarians Hong Kong comfortable victory did test us. Tonight tested us. It good game have. You'd 50-point win. In 2009, game South Africa Royal XV Rustenburg struggled bit opening game well. Gatland said special come son, Bryn, impressed fly-half Provincial Barbarians. He played pretty well, said Gatland Sr. He caused problems, particularly kicking game. That definitely pressure half. The Lions ultimately grateful Owen Farrell, came replace out-of-sorts Jonathan Sexton, influential Te'o. I said did pick Ben Te'o just bash gainline, Gatland said. His footwork subtleties game impressive really strong performance carrying. It good start him: accurate, played caused lot problems. Asked Sexton difficult night leaves trailing Saracens man No10 Test jersey, Gatland said: That pretty unfair making assessment like that. Owen Farrell big match temperament, there doubt. I happier he'd knocked post, given easier 10 minutes. But he played pretty good rugby 18 months he standout performers northern hemisphere rugby. Gatland stick plan fielding entirely different starting Eden Park. Asked changes make Wednesday, Gatland said: Fifteen. The plan gets start games. The All Blacks, meanwhile, sweating fresh injury doubts key backs Test Lions just weeks away. Ryan Crotty (ribs) Ben Smith (concussion) leave field second half Crusaders' 25-22 Super Rugby win Highlands Christchurch. Smith concussed times past years hooker Dane Coles suffering recurring concussion symptoms. Crotty certain sure miss Crusaders' match Lions Saturday All Blacks' captain Kieran Read sitting game. Next season, assuming Liverpool negotiate play-off round, English clubs Champions League. That large number, does necessarily follow greater representation lead better chance English success. Premier League sides struggling impose Europe recent years. From position decade ago finals reached regular basis Uefa genuine concerns English clubs faced Moscow 2008, strength Premier League obstacle progress Europe money attention grabber threatened domination. Chelsea English team appear final, won event penalties Munich 2012, reality past years English clubs rarely contest later stages knockout rounds. Leicester City surprisingly reach quarter-finals year, better experienced teams Arsenal Manchester City managed. City reached semi-final stage year earlier, Manuel Pellegrini final season real expectation summon self-belief strength character Real Madrid duly went scoring goal legs. The year that, English teams managed reach eight, Liverpool survive group stage. Various theories advanced English clubs fallen pace Europe. Some say Premier League difficult unforgiving, leaving little spare energy extra commitments midweek. Others believe English competition vastly overrated crash-bang-wallop players quickly confronted continental levels technique organisation. Leaving argument day, fact English clubs ground make European counterparts, particularly Barcelona, Real Madrid Bayern Munich. Short signing three-quarters Monaco team, good idea probably practical one, English clubs contention Champions League finals? Is hope significant improvement season, simply end disappointing campaigns instead four? Everyone promising busy summer, Arsenal, Europa League, quick look Champions League contenders need boost chances. By far robust team England season, simple works suits players Antonio Conte disposal, signs end champions stopped. Though N'Golo Kant Nemanja Matic good destructive duties required defensive midfielders little creativity area, burden falls Eden Hazard. Chelsea resolve Diego Costa situation, keeping bringing striker similar quality. There Romelu Lukaku strike inferior replacement. Chelsea linked unsettled Real Madrid forward lvaro Morata, Spain international reportedly favours Italy. Spurs great home season Europe Christmas, partly playing Champions League games Wembley. They playing games season better used it, reasonable pose question Mauricio Pochettino considers priority. Spurs mind good run Europe probably potential finalists just whereas, favourable wind couple tweaks team, ought good chance winning Premier League. Tottenham won title 1961 things first. Some Spurs players attracting clubs, concerted effort finish England year logical desirable step. A defensive rethink needed Etihad, beginning goalkeeper. News City signing Benfica Ederson means Pep Guardiola recognised mistake Claudio Bravo, denial season. City fine front, boast Brazil Argentina No9s Gabriel Jesus Sergio Agero plenty quality support positions need couple full-backs and, ever, cover centre-half Vincent Kompany. Keeping Agero Jesus happy problem City need tighten defence stop conceding stupid goals, observation Pellegrini years ago. Like Tottenham, Liverpool tempted energy title challenge extended run Europe, extended runs Europe disdained Anfield. Most feel Liverpool need reliable goalscorer, having failed end Premier League 10 season, Jrgen Klopp continue trust Philippe Coutinho, Roberto Firmino Sadio Man contribute them. Apart commanding goalkeeper centre-half amiss, driving presence midfield. Klopp needs evaluate tactics. Even European involvement season, Liverpool looked tired end. This does look like capable terrorising Europe old. United Uefa relaxing Atltico Madrid transfer ban, preventing Antoine Griezmann coming Old Trafford. The Frenchman class imagination crowd-pleaser United and, long-predicted wait January earliest, late galvanise European campaign. United hold David Gea, cost, bring striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic. Even Swede injury United scoring goals and, working theory Jos Mourinho likes big chap  Didier Drogba, Costa, Ibrahimovic,  Lukaku mentioned. It established Mourinho rates Belgian higher letting leave Stamford Bridge, United end trying outbid Chelsea Morata. The Uefa president, Aleksander Ceferin, given backing 2030 World Cup held England  combined British bid. The Slovenian said earlier week Europe turn host tournament, following 2022 Qatar 2026 event tipped place North America. Ceferin gone backing return Britain time England hosted won 1966 World Cup. For me, absolutely capable organising organisational point view, infrastructure point view, told BBC. But course it decision just FA, probably government too. But know English British football, deserve World Cup near future. I do know encouragement need, capable organising World Cup, I sure. That decision Football Association decide go, strongly support them. They political support. I just hope European bidders, good. I think ideal situation European bidder, Europe stands achieve it. Ceferin addressed corruption scandal saw predecessor Michel Platini Fifa president Sepp Blatter suspended football years respectively. The pair bans cut initial years appealing sanctions relating illicit payment Blatter Platini 2011. With  let Fifa matters', Uefa image damaged, said. And fault. OK, problems, extent. But I think Fifa improving. Things changing. I sure it easy, internal interests, many, people involved Fifa want stay there. But end, Fifa change completely,  hurt football organisations world. Britain gets taste hosting major event Saturday evening Champions League final, Juventus Real Madrid, taking place Cardiff. It brings Real Gareth Bale Wales helped country memorably reach semi-finals Euro 2016, Ceferin feels occasion help Wales development. It quite different bring Champions League final city like Cardiff compared city like London, said. London change Champions League final comes town. For Cardiff it fantastic experience. It bit challenge lack infrastructure  hotels things like  I sure forget it. It important development football. They fantastic results year, especially Euro, best players world. For small country like that, it fantastic result. An underwhelming night does mean major production trouble. Even gushing West End impresario, however, struggle claim 2017 British & Irish Lions launched tour New Zealand emphatic style. Having country just days, played like team minds bodies north equator. Jetlag clearly factor, ludicrously short time entire squad spent together. Then again, knew case 12 months ago, obvious domestic finals played week Lions game. On occasion players blamed underperformance administrators permitting conflicts arise. Add gentle loosener scratch opposition developed altogether comfortable. For looked unthinkable happen bunch part-timers ranks included sheep farmer, shopkeeper, nurse fruit picker. The Lions lost opening tour game times  1903 1924 South Africa 1971 Queensland  suitably grateful small mercy victory, undistinguished not. Aside pre-match fireworks, evening brightest sparks probably Ben Te'o, Kyle Sinckler Taulupe Faletau showed well. Sadly, half dozen chances making Test team good all, Warren Gatland insistence performance big deal. Jonathan Sexton form urgently needs rebooting New Zealanders went away overly impressed. Little went right outset, home looking brighter team deservedly leading 7-3 half-time. Only Owen Farrell replaced out-of-sorts Sexton 48 minutes, fellow Saracens Mako Vunipola, George Kruis Jamie George thrown fray, Lions edge ahead face-saving try 52nd minute Anthony Watson. The quarter, Rhys Webb making difference scrum-half, proved marginally uncomfortable. With desperately tough schedule ahead, Gatland particularly concerned lack penetration failure backs outshine team composed players tier New Zealand provincial rugby. His real consolation excellent performance talented son, Bryn, fly-half Barbarians. Otherwise, raft issues address Wednesday midweek game Auckland Eden Park, unbeaten Super Rugby leaders, Crusaders, follow Christchurch Saturday. Then again, craftiest double bluffs. If was, worked spectacularly. There shortage harsh judges New Zealand dismissing Lions game reached half-hour mark. Hogg, you worst full-back seen New Zealand, muppet, yelled wag. Why is Susan Boyle playing? It going extremely long weeks Lions improve very, quickly but, equally, credit given sprightly Barbarians. Drawn lower-ranked New Zealand provincial sides, waiting long time Lions credit coaching of, others, Bath Saracens winger Joe Maddock. Their captain hooker, Sam Anderson-Heather, scored good first-half try full-back, Luteru Laulala, himself fielding inquiries interested suitors. By comparison, Lions looked leaden skies Whangarei buildup game. Looking pristine surface hard believe biblical pre-match weather primary topic conversation. A lack moisture rarely problem world local standards 24 pre-game hours torrential rain extreme. Had fixture played Friday evening, sides needed snorkels. History, instead, record Lions victory sell-out crowd, sides failing decent chances close line. The Northland public liked seen one-time local favourite Jared Payne, injury intervene deprive return so-called House Payne. In event saw Te'o, spent youth playing north Auckland Silverdale, lay challenge No12s trip smoothly composed performance supported Gatland assertion centre running straight hard. Overall, iffy opening game set alongside broiling 2013 affair Hong Kong rusty 2009 fixture Royal XV Rustenberg. On occasions Lions went win threaten win series, illustrious boys 1971 lost opening fixture en route New Zealand. Not necessarily end world, then, absolutely enthused either. The Bundesliga team 1860 Munich face demotion Germany fourth fifth tier failing meet deadline third-division licence. 1860 make payment reportedly 5m 10m German football federation licence Friday afternoon, financial backer Hasan Ismaik said company HAM prepared pay 1860 refuses make necessary changes solve issues facing club. Ismaik, Jordanian billionaire owns 60% 1860, club hope meeting payment deadline. 1860 relegated Germany second division Tuesday play-off defeat Jahn Regensburg, team playing fourth-tier football season before. Despite missing payment, Ismaik said continue support club fourth fifth level and push forward necessary changes. The statement added: His emotional ties 1860 loyalty fans remains strong. The financial commitment beneficial work TSV 1860 affected aforementioned business decision. Ismaik loggerheads remaining club changes wants pushed 1860 said Thursday the club fulfill legal organisational reasons. The Sddeutsche Zeitung newspaper reported Ismaik, 49% voting rights 1860 line Bundesliga 50-plus-1 regulation, financial support dependent conditions given power. The 50-plus-1 rule seeks limit influence external backers. Ismaik, attend Tuesday play-off defeat, denied responsibility club plight accused management unscrupulous power struggles. President Peter Cassalette chief executive Ian Ayre resigned Tuesday, leaving vice-presidents Heinz Schmidt Hans Sitzberger charge. The play-off loss home marred violence angry fans. Around 1,000 riot police lined prevent situation escalating game held 15 minutes. 1860 expensive squad second division Stuttgart Hannover, secured return Bundesliga. 1860 finished bottom, leading play-off division third-place finisher. 1860, won Bundesliga 1966 played flight recently 2004, returned level time 24 years, Friday missed deadline means drop further. 1860 under-21, under-19, under-17 under-16 teams relegated season. Scoring goals Real Madrid usually problem with. They scored game season failed score Manchester City stopped Champions League semi-final year, run 64 games row net. If team stop them, though, Juventus, let goals 12 European games season 27 38 Serie A, equally comfortable four. So score Max Allegri side? The question, perhaps, shape Juve use. Juve began season struggle accommodate new signings, Gonzalo Higuan Miralem Pjanic. From beginning December, 4-2-3-1 prominent and, 2-1 defeat Fiorentina January, default, producing Juve best football season. But returned semi-final Monaco, reasons. Monaco play 4-4-2 midfield narrow attacking fullbacks. Using central defenders meant Juve competing v back, v middle (albeit differing alignments) wing-backs engage Monaco full-backs high pitch, worked Dani Alves set scored goals. What shape Juve use Champions League final probably depends expect Madrid line up. If Gareth Bale starts probably 4-3-3; Isco plays, probable, Madrid 4-3-1-2. Then challenge Juve similar Monaco posed: central forwards, midfield plays narrow attacking full-backs, encourage use 3-4-2-1 again. That presents Madrid number problems. Cristiano Ronaldo remains wonderful footballer finishing remarkable, goals rounds proved, mobile was. He not, past, area Dani Alves, isolate beat Andrea Barzagli. Against Atltico Madrid semi-final, fact, noticeable Karim Benzema pulling wide areas full-backs led Isco goal second leg. Perhaps avenue Madrid exploit forwards looking space Dani Alves years huge success (even Monaco goal semi-final come flank). Besides, Atltico, probably comfortable shape defensively Juve past seasons. The match-up Dani Alves Marcelo flank key, it probably true younger man improved past couple seasons, it insignificant that, 19 previous meetings Brazilians, Marcelo lost 13 times won just three.

Isco looks like having playmaking role probably Pjanic Sami Khedira Claudio Marchisio. Given Pjanic push forwards, Juve effect half central players deep three. That makes factors vitally important Madrid break Juve down. One midfield Casemiro, Luka Modric Toni Kroos dominate slight numerical advantage Mario Mandzukic, Paulo Dybala half Pjanic.

However, week featured criticism aplenty coaches players alike, obvious lesson important seek quality, quantity, sport undergo restructuring winter.

Referee J Child Attendance 13,445 Andy Murray believes Juan Martn del Potro left equal number psychological bruises epic five-set matches year discounts notion playing beat Argentinian round French Open Saturday. The Davis Cup [which Del Potro won] physically tough came long summer, Murray said four-set struggle past world No50 Martin Klizan Thursday. The Olympics [which went Murray way] physically mentally hard  psychologically I come period rest trained prepared it. When got Davis Cup, I'd played Olympics, gone Cincinnati New York. That tough. After I did feel great couple days, [playing] doubles singles. But remember matches. They were easy him, either, tough. I try make Saturday. For insight close Murray camp sufficiently detached lend perspective, brother Jamie go-to source Friday, doubles success Bruno Soares: 6-1, 7-6 (7-2) hour 21 minutes Russians Mikhail Elgin Karen Khachanov. He rough year results point view, health good all, elder Murray brother said. He really unlucky. He shingles, elbow stuff ill Miami ill here. He ill that. So easy  clear run anything. I think frustrating him. He unfortunate things turn fast. If great tournament here, feel great going grass great Wimbledon. In weeks' time, guys writing great again. Things change fast. Nor share downbeat assessment brother chances Roland Garros. Greg Rusedski, British No1, said Murray played poorly Klizan struggle beat Del Potro  fair view  Jamie sees upside. If keeps winning, tournament change quickly. He played amazingly matches winning  matters start tournament. You doubles here, seeds losing trying win advantage chance. But stuff happens grand slams. If hang long finds himself quarters semi-finals, knows takes win matches. That true. Last year, Murray survived five-set matches start reached final Novak Djokovic. The players game gears not. If Murray gets second week tournament shaken dregs cold laid low start week, dangerous world No1 be. Murray Sr said Kyle Edmund excellent run round mutually beneficial them, well. Edmund looked superb Thursday beating Renzo Olivo sets, Argentinian heroic performance Jo-Wilfried Tsonga tournament. Edmund play hard-serving South African Kevin Anderson Saturday. From point view, doing tournament Kyle Dan [Evans] girls doing well, cool. You kind feed bit. It nice atmosphere somebody root tournament. I sure everybody likes well. Nevertheless, Murray tougher beating Del Potro Edmund Anderson. The British pair meet semi-finals  dream later. Twelve thousand miles away Downing Street race No10 going on. The British & Irish Lions management big decision make week clear-cut looked couple months ago either. Once Lions finished fixture tour Crusaders Saturday, little option nominate preferred fly-half face All Blacks. The opening tour match New Zealand Provincial Barbarians XV rain-lashed Northland Saturday unlikely supply answers. Barring remarkable, comfortable Lions win anticipated fixture solely determine Ireland Johnny Sexton retains shirt filled distinction 2013 tour Australia. The respective body language Sexton main rival, Owen Farrell, nevertheless, tell coaches plenty. With Wales Dan Biggar mix, Lions hardly named competitive trio fly-halves. Sexton theoretically man possession years older now. Farrell, apprentice time, snapping boots one-time master just steered club consecutive European triumphs. Biggar long Warren Gatland key lieutenants. Those assume Farrell, does England, shift No12 jersey alongside Sexton big games getting slightly ahead themselves. Sexton selection Whangarei Toll Stadium underlined sense uncertainty. The Leinster pivot endured grim evening Pro12 final defeat Scarlets month needed available horse. Picking Farrell bench offers Gatland coaches chance  potentially  giving Sexton-Farrell 10-12 axis brief whirl. With preparation time limited, need know soon possible idea runner grass paper. Hence body language matters. Sometimes combination clicks immediately; pairings resemble unrelated fish. On 2009 Lions tour South Africa instant midfield rapport Jamie Roberts Brian O'Driscoll gloriously snug fit outset. Should Sexton Farrell half comfortable other company, Gatland hugely encouraged. The alternative scenario awkward. The chances Sexton Farrell start Crusaders Christchurch; touring team picked apart Super Rugby team moment, Gatland opt stronger-running 12 Ben Te'o Robbie Henshaw consider Farrell primarily 10. Any hint sluggish start tour Sexton possible ramifications scarcely need spelling out. Nor does necessity, Lions, picking fly-half shape entire series. This old job: wears red Lions No10 jersey New Zealand inevitably hear plenty Barry John brilliance 1971. Last time 2005, Dan Carter delivered classic fly-half performance second Test Wellington. If modern All Blacks outwitted, Lions' chief playmaker relegate gifted Beauden Barrett supporting role. Sexton human some, all, flashed mind recent weeks. As recently March orchestrating Ireland Six Nations win England Dublin endured stop-start season pale features currently exude total confidence. Gatland certainly giving guarantees. We want players 10 games, coach said. That instinct moment: we considering 10s. Regarding Sexton specifically, revealing pause Irishman prospects mentioned. He knows needs games belt, murmured Gatland, choosing words carefully. He knows competition pretty fierce position he competitor that best 10s world rugby. There certainly sense Sexton Farrell playing 12. Honestly, you'd ask coaches, 31-year-old said. They have given hints Owen play there. He great success England 12 he great success Saracens 10. Maybe they try there, maybe wo. He obviously coming favourite start somewhere. I got concentrate bringing best performances myself gets me. If it good enough, I live that. Hopefully be. The 27-year-old Biggar say that, particularly gives authoritative performance Blues Wednesday. All contenders know tour physically draining, injuries certain play part. It hardest place tour attritional games be, Sexton said. You playing best world tour different pre-Test games really tough. That good us; perform confidence we match-hardened come Tests. The games particularly instructive; Lions undefeated Saturday night highly encouraged. Downing New Zealand takes doing Ireland managed autumn. You ca sit them, that thing I think Irish guys tell guys, Sexton added. You got attacking matter scoreline. You saw Chicago. When sat conceded tries. It just attacking ball hand, attacking kicking game defence well. Sexton knows win Lions series himself re-elected. Matt Mullan relishing chance lock horns Argentina scrum England forthcoming two-Test tour believes strong showing Pumas enhance claim hold No1 jersey. With Joe Marler Mako Vunipola away Lions, Wasps loosehead prop vying Ellis Genge starting berth Argentina, traditional heavyweights scrum. Of 30 players unavailable Eddie Jones 10 front-rows head coach challenged current squad injured away return. If chance there, want try play can, said Mullan. If person shirt Eddie eyes, stand good stead time selects group. Against Argentina combination technique size pride area  traditionally strength theirs know going challenge. We homework scrum battle going important there. In effort build camaraderie encourage competition Jones arranged quiz night 32-man squad  split teams  Wednesday. The referee Wayne Barnes wrote it, England defence coach, Paul Gustard, quizmaster Dylan Hartley won. This competitive element continued gym training camp. It bit challenge picks team. Having met boys chance sit talk them, added Mullan. It just really nice way interact know bit quicker. Chris Robshaw trained public session Twickenham Friday sore ankle Gustard confident fit Test, week Saturday. Marland Yarde, joined squad start week went stand-by case Denny Solomona failed recover ankle injury, travel Argentina. The fact Northern Ireland took friendly all, sandwiched training camps England Turkey, testament level diligence continues bear fruit. The key aspiration beat New Zealand  albeit maintain confidence squad punches weight standard  build Saturday crucial World Cup qualifier Azerbaijan. Back-to-back tournament appearances legitimate aim team consigned international football wilderness years. Northern Ireland manager, Michael O'Neill, selection dilemma predicted. Ross County Liam Boyce notched goal country excellent 45-minute display. Boyce claim start Baku established players one.For New Zealand low-key opening Confederations Cup preparations. Northern Ireland tempo vastly superior. Boyce career path hardly orthodox. After successful spell Irish League Cliftonville, Belfast boy recruited Werder Bremen. If shame Boyce failing make grade Germany, surprise ended club. Another prolific period followed joining Ross County. The faith shown Scottish flight club founded, Boyce returning 48 league goals 80 starts. In campaign just ended, 26-year-old scorer domestic league. Boyce task carry record internationals, easing burden Kyle Lafferty. Lafferty, future unclear unhappy spell Norwich City, left O'Neill substitutes here. Boyce took advantage faith bestowed confidently cutting inside lashing left-foot shot Stefan Marinovic minutes. Only fine Marinovic save prevented Boyce strike partner, Josh Magennis, doubling hosts' lead attack. That flow pressure remained half-time Leeds United striker Chris Wood barely afforded touch. Conor McLaughlin ball visitors' net, earlier foul denying full-back proper credit stunning half-volley. With work done, Boyce remained inside interval. Lafferty impact instant, 29-year-old turning Magennis cross right just wide. Magennis try luck, header skimming crossbar. New Zealand best opportunity match came 25 minutes play, substitute Kosta Barbarouses thwarted inside post. Sergio Ramos described date history, waited long time for. The time Real Madrid position, Alfredo Di Stfano played final game club, departing bitterly defeat Helenio Herrera Internazionale. Two years before, Ferenc Puskas scored three, Eusebio goal denied Amsterdam; time that, time achieved seek emulate Saturday, Paco Gento extra-time winner defeated Milan 3-2 Heysel Stadium. That 59 years ago now, victory securing Madrid players 50,000 pesetas each, 25,000 trophy: bachelors earned 20 month, married players 29, left Belgium 148 better off. They earned it: Madrid just completed league European Cup double. It happened before, previous years, happened again. Until now? Madrid won 27 league titles European Cups, season. Like 1964 1962, 90 minutes away. Inter Benfica denied then; Juventus stand history  history, Ramos said, really word, biggest, successful club is. Madrid won 11 European Cups, come alone, stretching Brussels. These players achieve Puskas, Amancio, Snchez, Butragueno, Zidane, original Ronaldo did. Throughout history, Madrid team won most. We ca live past, badge imposes know obligations, Ramos said. Our history coincidence. For opportunity wonderful sport gives us. It opportunity eclipse successful generations. To Di Stfano, [Hctor] Rial Gento did. Much changed then, long time passed, lot players. These different days. Pepe Santamara recalled bonus did far. Yesterday, Juventus Dani Alves grinned cheeky grin said: the president promised red horse [a Ferrari] win  let delivers. Madrid bonus reportedly 1.5m euros each. The enormity achievement warrants it, them. After all, just 1958, just wait half century double; record stands them: 25 years passed team defended European title. This chance win second year row, Ramos said. Back then, Carlo Ancelotti, man led Madrid dcima, 10th European Cup years ago, pitch Milan. So Ruud Gullit, Frank Rijkaard Marco van Basten. In Champions League era, team emulated Milan team, defined epochs like Arrigo Sacchi did. Juventus consecutive finals but, having won 1996, 1997 1998 defeated  2003 2015. Real Madrid feeling finals; used winning them, Gigi Buffon said, smiling slightly. We, hand, lost lot finals. For Madrid, 11 wins 13, finals years, Ramos described barbaric. For Juventus, eight. We going try change history, Buffon added. At 39, opportunity: trophy won. The time tried, Juve beaten Barcelona. That night Berlin, Dani Alves played side, collecting European Cup; course team-mate. I'd like win it; I took them, I'd like back, Alves said. Buffon admitted: I asked Dani teach win competition. There thorn Juventus side, Alves said. Whether that lost final years ago, years won competition, lost 1998 final offside goal  The offside goal, cheekily referenced, scored Pedja Mijatovic, finally end Madrid 32-year wait trophy despite barren years come define them. Alves enjoying this, moment fun, fear. We scared Madrid history, added. We play ambition desire. We hungry, there plate us. We there, pick cup it. Told Alves words, Ramos replied: we quarter nine. If so, hour late. It date, anyway. And historic Juventus too, completing treble, making clubs European history. Alves third, making unique. It kind occasion. A Champions League final big anyway, feels significant; The plot simple  win European Cup  subplots everywhere, waiting fleshed out. From Alves treble, rivals, team faced 42 times complete international team-mate Marcelo, Buffon chance. It would change career it, golden history, Alves said. Juventus captain, Buffon oldest player lift trophy described potential victory perfect finale. It perfect final them; strongest sides Europe, Italian Spanish champions. The competition best defence best attack. Different styles, different identities, shared. So feels symbolic. The stories many. Like time met final, 1998 single anxiously-awaited game Madrid history, Mijatovic described like going back-and-white colour. The European Cup successful team finally won modern era, Zidane side. He leave Turin win European Cup: player, assistant coach, coach. Here again, 18 months flight managerial career, seeking second. And there more. There Gonzalo Higuan club, scored remembered missed, sense bitterness accompanying departure. I trying think it, admitted. Sami Khedira, Champions League winner Madrid 2014, too. Lads it pleasure, said left. This week, said different, admitting: As soon I good game, criticism started people asked I good enough. It got nerves. At Juventus differently. After years there, I leave. And lvaro Morata, credits making man. Then there Gareth Bale Cardiff, forced pills training matches fights make it. Because probably wo, there Isco, centre-stage last. And Cristiano Ronaldo bid player score Champions League finals  Ramos does first. Asked star Ronaldo played together, Zidane said: Him, sure. I play quite well, scores goals. Too humility good thing either, Ronaldo said. We better. Alves agreed. Indeed, embraced underdog role. But determined enjoy this. He started sales pitch, like presenter getting going, end too. Good afternoon, begun, it special able live day. To alongside great players, playing final, lovely. Everyone stop watch game. We lucky enjoy moment. What try make night special, sweat drop; coronation season. He ended calling it: very, very, very, beautiful. Whatever happens, date set, history stories told. The question ones. Margaret Court glittering example Australia domination world tennis 1960s 70s  prolonged period supremacy murderer row superstar players iconic, instructive nicknames like Rocket, Muscles Newk took them. It time Australia sun-blessed climate, abundance tennis facilities lack stifling class systems held sport countries, destined ensure world-beating talent flourish forever. Even then, fattest times, comprehension country produce female champion rival Court. She living legend mere champions. At times like past week, Court determinedly administered upper cut crushing right cross reputation, pays note noble achievements they forgotten entirely, Court record 24 grand slam singles titles (and 64 including doubles) generations Australians little fading facts dusty almanacs. From late teens mid-30s, marriage, multiple retirements birth children, Court acquired trophy collection staggering proportions: 11 Australian Open singles crowns, US Open titles Roland Garros, lawns Wimbledon.

Yet that, week detour tabloid ignominy, near-identical imbroglio 2012, Court was, words, an anonymous champion little-loved one. I do think younger people today really know I done, told Steve Flink 2012. Personally does affect me. It probably bit sad history game.

Overlooked current evisceration court public opinion, Court cries injustice persecution, fact purveyor divisive opinions actually charmed run. In 1970, Court kicked things praising South Africa apartheid policy (South Africans thing better organised country, particularly America, said. I love South Africa.

There expat cricket fans board, making early run Birmingham Trans-Tasman derby Australia New Zealand Edgbaston. As train left Coventry announcer reassured that, quick, time round reached New Street. Which set day perfectly. Because longueurs showers blew over, carrying fat cold raindrops, match happened hurry. It time, it, used it. With quick bowlers playing, precious little around. It hard road, Edgbaston, Australia fast bowlers. It 16 years team won game here, 2001 Ashes. Since then, lot quick men taken lot hard knocks ground. In 2004 Champions Trophy, Glenn McGrath Brett Lee rattled Marcus Trescothick Michael Vaughan, little inkling 2005 Ashes going different sort series ones just it. In 2010 Australia played couple T20s Pakistan, Dirk Nannes, Mitchell Johnson, Shaun Tait thrashed Umar Akmal. And then, 2013, Mitchell Starc worst days career here, giving 75 runs 10 overs Ian Bell Jonathan Trott. Starc member particular attack time  senior man, now, gang four, James Pattinson, Pat Cummins, Josh Hazlewood. In theory, finest, fastest, exciting bowling attack sport moment. Though like predecessors, struggled here. Australia have actually managed team, largely Cummins Pattinson injuries years. And we waiting make debut supergroup now, Pattinson left New Zealand, make room burly, bald John Hastings, Pete Best band. Not Pattinson omission reassuring rest us. He taken 20 wickets 11 runs county championship far season, 11 28 Royal London Cup, team. All cricket improved quick bowling. But, fun spectacle neutrals ground, would think far ahead start fretting fast bowlers England stay fit, group match Saturday, and, course, Ashes series it, looming view far end year. You prepare storm latching windows sandbagging doors, Jacques Kallis said talking like face Mitchell Johnson, but rain comes, it surprise. New Zealand were looking lay defences. Their openers, Luke Ronchi Martin Guptill, decided best thing counterattack. Starc started fast, straight, Hazlewood opened end. Only, white ball just would swing them. Guptill went straight business, hit glorious fours misjudged shot, early delivery Hazlewood hit leading edge point. Ronchi decided heave bat reach. He hit exquisite shot minute, ridiculous next. He took shine Cummings, came change seventh over. A cover, struck slightest tap bat, shot day. One moment stepping leg uppercut point, coming inside line steer keeper head. When dropped mid-on Starc, followed hitting shot again, time little harder higher, four. Cummins gave 52 runs overs. Meanwhile, Kane Williamson easing masterly innings, end, hours later, score exactly 100. Guptill Ronchi rush, playing limit capabilities. But Williamson, like great batsmen, great athletes, simply time play else, experienced slower motion team-mates, had, somehow, different perception time, allowed wait ever-so-late play cuts, stride forward pull foot. When went, snapped real time again, reminded just quick Australians are. Hazlewood swept New Zealand team, finished 52.

It sign times New Zealand innings ended record total trans-Tasman rivals global tournament, felt underwhelming one, ending cascade wickets unused allotted 46 lost 37 runs 35 balls picking men deep. Luke Ronchi happy-go-lucky 65 just 33 balls  including audacious lifted sixes assault Pat Cummins  ninth one-day Williamson given lower order license swing. But New Zealand sitting pretty 254 start 40th over, far grander looked possible. Australia bounded interval feeling better themselves, following shabby display field times delighted Edgbaston crowd. While Glenn Maxwell shone catches, Ronchi earned lives 24 54 thanks bungled run Matthew Wade stumps dropped catch Mitchell Starc. Starc, saw ball error mid fly head four, bowlers Smith referred rusty  fitting description left-armer overs, 52 white ball swing New Zealand batsmen went untroubled. Starc lack edge near three-month break following stress fracture foot decision miss Indian Premier League. Australia chose hold well-tuned seamer, James Pattinson, explosive spell Nottinghamshire, preferring worthy hostile John Hastings instead. Hastings picked wickets bowler Williamson tucked most, 25 balls sent right-armer taken 42 runs blitz crisp cuts mown slog sweeps way three-figures. Having 77 Ronchi 99 Ross Taylor (46), Williamson perished ball century run steer point. From went way Hazlewood who, having earlier removed Martin Guptill 16 going cross-seam early, profited New Zealand lower order trying swing hills giving sighter first.

James Whitaker, England chairman selectors, came hoping Haseeb Hameed arrest concerning slump form. Instead, treated wonderful display Yorkshire seamer Ben Coad, second ball Hameed caught nine. Coad ended career-best 25, fourth five-wicket haul remarkable season, Lancashire bundled 123. Yorkshire dreamy day overall. They lost toss (curiously) invited field, lost entire session rain trail 30 93 day lost 24 overs. Until Peter Handscomb slashed wide Luke Procter, shared 64 Adam Lyth thrown Lancashire attack (there optimism, though, fitness James Anderson). Alex Lees played ugly innings brimming heaves, falling Tom Bailey  accompanying send-off, bowler crowd  proved mere footnote. It worth wondering impending arrival Tom Kohler-Cadmore impact Lees.

Coad began trapping Steven Croft ended having Shiv Chanderpaul caught fourth slip; saw Dane Vilas caught behind. Ryan McLaren counterattacked but, Brooks returned pin Jordan Clark front, Sidebottom took lbw. Lancashire tea Coad tail afterwards, Bailey poking midwicket Stephen Parry second slip.

The tall, powerful Spaniard admitted struggles thoughts year triumph bay. I remember year I semi-finals I thinking, like, I 25% [towards] lifting trophy. That I started think it. This year, I just focusing opponent. Her opponent doubt similarly attentive homework keen avoid sort energy-draining angst flooded racket quite stirring fightback.

Novak Djokovic partnership Andre Agassi come early pressure week French Open. It summer. The defending champion remains track semi-final tournament perennial prince, Rafael Nadal, cracks showing fledgling coaching relationship Agassi, missed hour gruelling five-set struggle tough Argentinian Diego Schwartzman round commitments French television. Asked thought Agassi arriving box 3-4 second set, Djokovic said: He supposed today, finished yesterday in-person collaboration Paris. He different things supposed do. He doing that. He managed reschedule certain things today, planned. I appreciate that. Further asked Agassi earlier statement Eurosport doing gig nothing, Djokovic said: I going said completely true, it completely decision. I hope that going stay long time create going long term. We do set stone. We great chat match. He going try best biggest tournaments family time allows commitments has. Agassi told Djokovic that, here, leave fulfil earlier commitments, possibly match, Albert Ramos-Violas, beat Lucas Pouille, 6-2, 3-6, 5-7, 6-2, 6-1 fading light. In interview Eurosport Boris Becker, guided Serb 12 major victories ended three-year relationship December, Agassi revealed working Roland Garros on time, dime, money. No doubt link tournament sponsors, Longines, ease financial burden spending week Paris. I do want anything, I do need anything, I want help him, said. Djokovic needed help quelling Schwartzman determined challenge hours 19 minutes. There awry world No2 tennis again, encouraging weeks lately. There rough moments, awkward break point serve, 4-0 fourth. Djokovic received time warning, code violation. He putting lot love umpire way 5-7, 6-3, 3-6, 6-1, 6-1 win. Agassi revealed little tennis philosophy persuade Djokovic switch lights-out attack thoughtful ways breaking opponents down. For it simple. His game built controlling baseline executing big targets. He guy plays precisely lines. Occasionally he defence surprises this. He guy throws body blow body blow body blow he just thought lot court. So I think there ways game 30 years old  older hopefully he going want play  start make easier himself knowing net. He sounded equivocal working Djokovic Wimbledon. If wants there, I come figure out. It lot responsibility. Whatever practical achievable, 100% I make effort. I committed that, long feels like I help him, I will. Does really need particular, does need week off, does need grand slam? We figure go. A 100% I committed seeing achieve dream is. Nadal spent probably time arranging courtside water bottles constructing 27 clear winners 82 points beat Nikoloz Basilashvili 6-0, 6-1, 6-0. The Georgian, year lost Kyle Edmund round, went downhill faster Franz Klammer. At end patrons treated rare spectacle Nadal abandoning hair-tugging, ball-bouncing rituals served match like man pants just intermittent rain dumped Court Philippe Chatrier. Today best matches I played, doubt, Nadal said later. If Djokovic clash place final, odds Spaniard, won 20 21 matches clay season. This 100th best-of-five match favourite surface. Only Robin Soderling 2009 Djokovic years ago prevailed him, phenomenal record. Before quarter-finals Nadal celebrate 31st birthday Saturday then, goes well, follow win compatriot, Roberto Bautista Agut, beat Jiri Vesely 6-3, 6-4, 6-3. Portsmouth appointed Kenny Jackett new manager. The 55-year-old signed two-year deal newly promoted Sky Bet League One club, days Paul Cook quit charge Wigan. This fantastic opportunity I looking forward getting started. It exciting challenge, Jackett told Pompey official website. This club passionate fanbase 12th man us. Hopefully build momentum season continue progress. I promise I work hard I possibly make sure bring success Portsmouth. The club said in advanced talks Joe Gallen assistant manager. Jackett, won promotion League One Millwall Wolves, work resigning Rotherham manager November. Cook left Fratton Park Wednesday guiding Pompey League Two title victory Cheltenham final day. We delighted announce Kenny new manager. He ticks boxes us, Pompey chief executive, Mark Catlin, said. He managed big clubs big expectations past plenty experience getting sides League One. Three months ago people wanted strangle him, Massimiliano Allegri said smile, night just wanted hug him. The story goes Dani Alves arrived Juventus, Gigi Buffon took asked teach win Champions League. He able exactly Allegri speaking just Alves taken Cardiff, delivering pass goal volleying home second Monaco. He provided assists leg semi-final Turin, superb backheel. Juventus final again, years lost Barcelona Berlin Alves team. On time, facing him, Marcelo, Real Madrid recent clsico defeat bemoaned: It fault. His crime: committing foul prevented Lionel Messi winning it. Few noticed provided late assist James Rodrguez equalise place  days later scored late tighten Madrid grip title. Five days that, finally broken Bayern Munich, 109th minute Champions League quarter-final, weaving through, hurdling challenges leaving Ronaldo open goal finish German champions. And are, meeting again, time Cardiff Saturday. International team-mates long opponents club football biggest rivalry: defenders that. Full-backs? Footballers, stop. Brilliant, too. Brazilians, both. Different, breaking mould. I do want just player, Alves says, not. Nor Marcelo. Automatons? No, thanks. Better embrace game, enjoy  and, lest forgotten, win too. Between 53 trophies total, soon 54. They key men, arguably key men, best teams Europe. Over years hard critics, seek different matter; admit men bit getting used to. They defend, detractors say, line facile flawed. It feels goes football: dare smile, do, accusation deepens, sport deadly business, enjoying means committed, clearly are. Every squad needs personalities  contagious word Zinedine Zidane uses Marcelo  fun does equal frivolous; play years Barcelona decade Madrid dedication. Juventus sign Barcelona decline you; thought miss Alves, wrong. People automatically think attack, ca defend. Not true, Alves said. That years ago yesterday. He changed; have, recognising contribution late, process finds parallels Marcelo, ever. It taken long. It just false defend; is, Alves says, terms need tying down. What, asks, is defend'? That dribbles attacks? Bloody hell, football boring, would it? You prepare [only] defend guy dribbles past ... what, think you that quick? If defend', do attack; attack', do defend? What football for? To win. And win score more. The winner is [just] team defends incredibly; defend do score, it worthless. Even Brazil, rushed embrace pair. There occasional doubts  Marcelo start 2014 final Atltico Madrid Lisbon Alves relationship Barcelona board fraught  offer far outweighs flaws. If attack, managers want to, good it. They following orders, breaking them. They played 1,000 games them, demanding clubs earth. Marcelo started playing Brazilians futsal Spaniards ftbol sala  indoor five-a-side  age four. His brother-in-law plays professionally couple years Madrid Marcelo escape play too, joining competitions. In interview futsal magazine, given, admitted like career court pitch, began. Marcelo brother-in-law highlights dribbling technical skill, ability improvise difficult situations thinks can. In part, inheritance coincidence: Marcelo Alves products environment experience. Futsal played smaller, heavier ball flies round court, floor; game touch, speed, technique thought. I pleasure playing futsal school, Alves said. And gives intelligence: it sport need use head. There little space, marking tight, need smart, quick thinking. In football people intelligence big advantage others. It just defenders attack; defenders play; way attack. Full-backs bombing line thing, Alves Marcelo else: come inside, responsibility, create, seek one-twos, people  just drop shoulder burst speed, No10s, wrong position. Full-back just clue red herring. This season Marcelo arguably Madrid best player. At Sevilla went Alves. At Barcelona provided assists Spain, Messi. At Juventus, created chances Champions League. Did him? asked beaming Allegri performed superbly Monaco. Did assists? That central playmaker does. It similar Marcelo does too. Jorge Valdano says: He brings ball outstanding naturalness ease; goes middle pitch home and, gets pitch, solutions forward has. We used full-backs like Gordillo Roberto Carlos plough wing; Marcelo goes planting flowers. As Alves, Giorgio Chiellini admitted crazy culture assimilating hard first, like Messi, another level technically. So are, Brazilians similar spirit, players love play. In purple Marcelo, seeking European Cup years; black white Dani Alves chasing treble seasons, 34th major title. It bad defenders defend. Who wins knows fun finding out. All teams competing Champions Trophy now; harbour thoughts winning it. It takes wins row guaranteed delight raising cup skies south London 18 June. This far palatable format players World Cup time wasted. It far palatable fans well. If sun continues shine tournament success. From 1 June 12 June match day venues  The Oval, Edgbaston Cardiff  followed swiftly semi-finals final Oval. The likeliest teams contest semi-finals Australia England Group A India South Africa Group B. But granted. There easy games . The tournament kicks England playing Bangladesh Oval. No problem there, then. Except time teams met ICC competition, Adelaide years ago, Bangladesh deservedly won 15 runs proceeded quarter-finals World Cup, unlike England. Long gone days Bangladesh felt overawed opponents. We reel key batsmen thinking. Tamim Iqbal, Mushfiqur Rahman, Shakib al Hasan Mahmudullah going strong. Moreover, pitches dry tend brown Oval Bangladesh  beat New Zealand Wednesday lost Pakistan Saturday  like them. The following day Australia meet New Zealand Edgbaston, Australia bound win one. Except New Zealand reserve best playing noisy neighbours Tasman. And talents Kane Williamson, Martin Guptill, Trent Boult Tim Southee consider. Even Brendon McCullum helm Kiwis beat provided distracted remarkable explanation old team-mate, Doug Bracewell, faced drink-driving offence home. His lawyer used Python defence. This revolved dead parrot, cockatoo, belonged increasingly distraught girlfriend. Bracewell raced home offer consolation despite having taken drink two. In end pleaded guilty took punishment. The Australians distracted serious: dispute Cricket Australia Australian Cricketers' Association contracts. David Warner, potentially devastating openers competition, vociferous topic, suggesting players forego playing Ashes winter necessary. Perhaps view Warner Australia 21st-century Arthur Scargill. In case wary Scargill Shot, played golfers odd opening batsman does quite evade boundary fielder  a good strike you? Even pertinently, Australia pace. It rare occurrence Mitchell Starc, Pat Cummins James Pattinson fit simultaneously ever-reliable Josh Hazlewood slouch. Whether pace great asset surfaces usually brown, slow true remains seen. The old theory England prospered ODI cricket playing juicy seamer-friendly pitches, produce relatively low-scoring games. The template changed now. With free-flowing players prefer tracks batsmen swing line impunity. Such benign surfaces encourage presence wrist-spinners, surprising. Australia interesting one, Adam Zampa, best world moment playing, Rashid Khan represents Afghanistan. In Group B, selection wrist-spinners well. Oddly, India rely tried trusted Ravi, Ashwin Jadeja. South Africa lean ubiquitous Imran Tahir, 38. Twenty years younger Pakistan Shadab Khan, played ODIs. Sri Lanka back-of-the-hand men, Seekkuge Prasanna left-armer Lakshan Sandakan. In group Pakistan, leadership wicketkeeper, Sarfraz Ahmed, expected prevail. So bound dangerous. It hard banish smile learning Umar Akmal jettisoned squad chairman selectors paid sufficient attention fitness. That chairman Inzamam-ul-Haq, who, captain Pakistan, spent time wicker chair outfield batting nets practice days. Meanwhile, Sri Lanka wee bit frustrating Kumar Sangakkara, retired international cricket, scored century Surrey. If available just squeak side, tends stick old-fashioned ploy hitting ball fielders heads. At final whistle hot, fun, slightly wild afternoon Wembley, Arsne Wenger crouched touchline roared, quite abandon, genuine sense release, anger. Cuffs crisply buttoned, wasp-waisted black slacks, Wenger eventually sank familiar double fist-pump, knees bent, like man wedding performing slow, heartfelt air-maracas solo. Twenty minutes later climbing Wembley steps players face royal party coyly gleaming trophy. Arsenal 2-1 defeat Chelsea means Wenger seven FA Cup winners' medals, manager, Chelsea Liverpool entire respective histories. His Cup coach Coupe De France 27 years ago. For vicissitudes job, draining obsession, pretty clear sweetness sucked moments like these. But uniquely gruelling season, caught strangest long goodbyes, energies sapped stasis pitch, hostile environment Wenger suggested derailed team vital moments. Never mind hostility stemmed guileless performances place. You do Premier League manager 20 years straight degree galvanising stubbornness. Even moment victory Wenger fielded questions bowels Wembley media suite future, insisting reason things unclear, issues resolved. A board meeting Tuesday surely provide full-stop saga way another. For joy moment Wenger sound, time public, like man just way out. For it worth, time, kept medal. Wenger aside genuinely sensational Cup final. This despite fact Chelsea basically did turn half, lost man 20 minutes fielded double player year managed look like wandered shopping centre door little polite stop ask way out. Before kick-off oldest cup competition looked boisterous good health. Wembley vast, seething noise pit, genuine crackle event-glamour air. The anthem banger, fireworks just right, noise inside stadium unrelenting, pre-match silence impeccably observed. At point, Arsenal simply seized game. For cult managerial personality, players make teams long periods Wembley was Wenger endless farewell urgent topic fate Alexis Snchez, prepared sign vast new contract. Snchez fizzing little ball muscle vim half, scoring opening goal help handball-assist. Around team turning putrid midwinter, points surrendered, forgettable afternoons, played real verve. Victor Moses discomfited Danny Welbeck vigour natural tendency pull side. A second yellow card midway second half diving capped wretched afternoon. N'Golo Kant hurried harried Granit Xhaka, Mesut zil Aaron Ramsey pulled height asserted game pass move. At Per Mertesacker majestic. Faced dreadful Diego Costa, Arsenal captain clean challenge read game brilliantly unfamiliar role heart three. Snchez fifth-minute opener strange thing, awarded volleyball-blocked ball Chelsea defence. Aaron Ramsey offside him, shrunk away ball, allowing Snchez skitter finish outside right foot. Chelsea protested. They better served simply playing whistle. Arsenal continued play real verve 3-0 half-time. The real wobbles appeared interval Chelsea surged, looking, time, like Conte-issue champion selves. Costa equalised, Ramsey stoop head winner. At end, Wembley turf swirled familiar paraphernalia victory, Wenger continued weave turf, hugging players, eventually moving wall red white Arsenal fans, little shyly perhaps, taking unanimous rolling wave applause. Wenger waved, hands aloft, quite wave goodbye. It hoped comes farewell conducted warmth grace antsiness crept Wenger relations board stands. There feeling Wenger involved brinkmanship board, negotiating directors football conditions retention. If so, verve team here, gleam medal, just tip balance, stave goodbye little longer. Picture professional footballer best clubs Europe season. Think exorbitant wages world does pay taxes. Think Monaco, lifestyle, casino, sophistication, wealth. Now think Bernardo Silva rethink everything. The Portuguese playmaker antithesis average elite-level player. The cliches simply apply him. In Monaco lived tiny one-bedroom flat small kitchen. He cleaned dishes dishwasher hung smalls dry modest balcony. Of course, sea view impressive money earned - pounds 30,000 week - splashed huge house outskirts city mod cons some, no. That Bernardo Silva. He does ostentation extravagance. He does tattoos fancy watches, Ferraris private jets. He different. But, Silva just regular guy, regular player. At 22 - 23 August - Silva brains Monaco took Ligue 1 Europe storm season. He sees things everybody else: space, pass, run. He plays move. His movement ball sensational. There intelligent player Pep Guardiola Silva summer signing. Guardiola loves smart player. Silva knows slow play accelerate - quick-on-the-ball quick-thinking. Of attributes, however, impressive control ball. Bernardo Silva? I bubble gum ball glued foot. I pay watch play, said Benjamin Mendy, Monaco left-back team won league month time 17 years. Another team-mate, Jemerson, centre-back, says Silva magic world. At training matches does incredible things. You think lose ball no, feet. You do know it. He magician I elf weird shape ears, said Atletico Mineiro player, laughing. Silva gentleman pitch. He moans sulks fair. Complaining, brawling losing education thinking quickly been. He knew win physical battle smallest lightest wondered avoid challenges, says Pepa, manager Benfica under-17 team. That today steps ahead receives ball. The similarities certain David Silva, City course, quite obvious. That Bernardo City makes sense. He heir David, replace him. Same talent, profile, style, left foot, qualities, height (1.73m). For Guardiola perfect player. He versatile. He play striker wide, bit deeper box-to-box role - like David again. Three years Bernardo Silva arrived Monaco euros 15m (pounds 12.1m) Benfica, training team, leaving. Monaco say huge offer City. In seasons principality, Jorge Mendes protege gone strength strength. He Portuguese international, missed summer European Championship injury just best season career goals assists Ligue 1. He developed special player worth penny spent Manchester City. He big-game player well. He scored Villarreal Champions League qualifier, Tottenham group stages, last-minute equaliser Paris league proved turning point domestic season, goal Marseille, assists Manchester City Marseille again. We ball away him, incredible. I admire player is, said Hugo Lloris Spurs beaten twice Monaco Champions League.

Patrick passed away 18 April 2016, aged 19. While celebrating opening game season outer northern Melbourne suburb Diamond Creek, brawl broke Windy Mile pub. Patrick allegedly stepped peacemaker struck punch head. The alleged offender committed stand trial manslaughter, trial commence 17 July year supreme court  police allege took end Patrick life punch, split second. I went high school Patrick years Year 12 I spent nearly day classes. He quiet, humble extremely intelligent boy rarely spoke class. At end high school, granted scholarship study La Trobe University. He brilliant career fulfilling life. Unfortunately, stories uncommon. Frequently hear similar deaths news nearly involve things; young men alcohol. Yet, television screens, violence glamourised glorified, nearly extremely masculine sporting settings. Last Sunday night, Fox Footy program Bounce, expert panel consisting Jason Dunstall, Cameron Mooney Daniel Frawley thought appropriate run segment titled Top 5 Jumper Punches AFL. A jumper punch, outlined panel, football player grabs opposition player neck football guernsey punches player jaw area face. The panel praised punch, labelling ripper. It overt display violence football field instead criticising it, panel framed punches positive light. How producers, writers involved think OK position violence way? The aired 7.20pm hour. Young people studio audience I sure young people tuning home. Footballers icons, role models heroes many. One Patrick favourite footballers, Mathew Richardson, recently joined Pat Cronin Foundation supporter. Why football personalities publicly encouraging on-field violence simply staggers me. The AFL came Tuesday stronger stance on-field punching various incidents caught eye match officials weekend match North Melbourne Melbourne. General manager football operations, Simon Lethlean, told SEN radio: The deterrent fines stopping on-field punching various forms want stamp  We do want punching continue. The AFL look Match Review Panel potentially suspend offending players rest season. Football panel programs do page. They present idea masculinity impenetrable. If society wants truly tackle issues violence, form punch pub, family home football field, television screens reflect realistic view masculinity. Bounce joining AFL criticising on-field punching encouraging it. Shows Bounce seek balance overly masculine including female panellist. Bounce welcomed Tegan Higginbotham The AFL Footy Show brought Rebecca Maddern year. While I welcome inclusion women Australian sporting shows, just does fix way shows present masculinity screens. Our sports presenters encouraging fair play respectfulness sport, jumper punch type violence, matter. Football massive Patrick life, young Australians, male female. Over-the-top representations masculinity television screens does assist stopping unnecessary acts violence took Patrick life. Young people impressionable, showing realistic version masculinity, shows men susceptible emotions not, fact, invincible, day help eradicate coward punch altogether. Along work foundations like Patrick parents started, education alcohol violence, work AFL, media play important role ensuring young man taken family. Patrick forever 19 years age, I hope family experiences Cronins past year. It strange hear England coach talking players changing perceptions wake penalty shootout defeat followed familiar script, Steve Cooper good reason think mood shifting comes country generation footballers viewed. The man charge under-17 team lost Spain gut-wrenching fashion days ago, conceded injury-time equaliser beaten spot-kicks European Championship final Croatia, believing England starting fruits labour launching DNA blueprint half years ago. What really rewarding Croatia coaches saying publicly privately hotel, Cooper says. Also, there Uefa technical team observing, quite English speakers there, remarks getting  they comparing  positive. Most rewarding saying things intending do, like playing clear identity, playing attractive football, playing really good organisation structure. So that changing perceptions' comes from. Because there doubt  recognition work that going clubs  talent competitive Europe. Cooper certainly getting carried away knows long journey ahead England coaches players. Yet Welshman, spent years working Liverpool academy, approach coaching changed influence Jos Pep Segura, highly respected Catalan returned Barcelona youth setup, feels England getting lot things right. As introducing style football runs age groups, England encouraging young players open minds field self-analysing speaking peers a big drive leadership. One things shines talking Cooper England adopting collaborative approach international football, staff players different levels interact feels like club environment. There things like Croatia, Cooper says. Harry Kane sent video message, speaking experience development teams. Jack Butland, won Under-17 European Championship captained under-21s, FaceTime keepers lasted hour. Gareth Southgate sent clear powerful video message just semi-final  knows boys know worked development teams years genuine progress. Jamie Carragher video Monday Night Football studio videos Freddie Woodman, under-20s, Josh Onomah, played under-17s 2014, got share experiences. While clearly extremely talented individuals England Under-17 team scored 13 times conceded twice en route final  Chelsea Callum Hudson-Odoi Manchester City Jadon Sancho Phil Foden catch eye  obvious concern pathways exist club level. A glance England Under-17 squad triumphed European Championship finals 2014 reveals Lewis Cook, Bournemouth, player Premier League start season. I do think there does want homegrown players come through, Cooper says. And getting addressed clubs, look different club. Cooper comes sort person glass half relation youth development. Released Wrexham couple years professional, offered job working club under-11s. In driving minibus marking pitches club pulled together, Cooper discovered vocation life. I just fell love coaching, says. Following footsteps father, Keith, distinguished career top-flight referee, quite appealing. I thought stick I used Monday morning, Cooper says, laughing. No, I joking. Dad right top, 70-odd Uefa games, derby, it nice look that. When stuff Football Gold, he there. Cooper thirst learning meant raced coaching badges passed pro licence course age 26, leaving Wrexham Anfield couple years later. Rafael Bentez manager time months Cooper arrival Spaniard brought Barcelona staff  Rodolfo Borrell, Pep Guardiola assistant coach Manchester City, Segura  senior positions Liverpool youth setup. I thought I decent place coaching I met Pep [Segura], I realised I load work do, Cooper says. From coaching point view, biggest influence me. He just showed way  different way. The biggest message Pep gave you got know want team look like end  close eyes imagine happening. But it thing knowing looks like, it there. That I pride myself now, having clear view team getting right I want go, bits there. So train game-model, example? Pep taught create vision build it. More anything, you got vision, you got steps there, periodisation training, type practices use, individual profiling players, stick it. You need belief it. Asked provide bit detail, Cooper says: It criteria areas pitch. It was just case he'd say: We going play going split, we there, there, pitch just play see.' There element players need make decisions. However, we going criteria play back, we criteria midfield pitch. Fascinated tactics formations, 37-year-old gives impression talk hours subject likes training field. He excited future looking forward Under-17 World Cup India October European Championship finals summer, England hosting. As bigger picture, Cooper sees real progress. There going cynical judgmental view senior team wins  Gareth, I sure, say that, says. But plan serve players teams stick it. We wanted lose final Spain, losing helps win long term, we got live that. Jaap Stam says reputation tarnished struggled season Reading insists appointed club manager summer risk parties. Stam steered Reading Monday Championship play-off final Huddersfield, expectations, believes team benefited decision play Dutch way. Stam signed three-year contract long-term objective reaching Premier League, Dutchman led club  finished 17th 19th past seasons  touching distance flight express speed. His previous management experience came assistant PEC Zwolle Jong Ajax, under-21 Ajax. It clubs risk employ abroad, young manager well, just need chance, Stam said. Everyone needs I needed make decision I wanted that. It people [who make decision] myself well. Do I want that? Is good myself? I reputation myself, knows that. But I believe myself well. Even managers risk think happen does work out. What then? Will ruin name? You need in, work hard believe yourself, that what happened season. Regardless Reading clinch promotion not, determined manage level played at. I want  I played  manager I want top, hopefully Reading, Stam said. It important believe team ambition. I want work something. I do want work grey areas say nice end 10th 11th doing year. I want reach team highest level. The 44-year-old contend now-completed Chinese takeover hanging club majority season believes biggest challenge returning England implementing Dutch philosophy. How playing season different wanted: playing possession, going forward, controlling games creating chances scoring goals. The Dutch way, attacking football. In UK thoughts playing certain way maybe dangerous. That wanted it. Andy Murray finds himself peculiar position highest-ranked player considered Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic Stan Wawrinka discussions French Open, starts Sunday. Nadal, correctly, odds-on favourite win record 10th title here, probably semi-final defending champion, Djokovic who, Murray displaced world No 1 months ago, slowly rediscovered old magic brings new coach Paris, Andre Agassi.

Nadal 17-1 clay year, free injury playing best tennis years. He turns 31 tournament content, having withdrawn quick wins year ago heal lingering damaged wrist wrecked season. So, invariably way crazy sport, problems lesser greater degree  know cope. They managing physical mental stress game long second nature them. None fazes Murray. He agree downbeat assessment chances. Many good judges do. Yet strength concerns health form, hurled dangerous: underdog. It easily forgotten obdurate Scots won Olympic gold medal majors bad back; life, coped split kneecaps structural weaknesses right wrist ankle. But used frailties motivation excuses and, eve second slam season, finds himself subject old doubts again. I worried it, said, more frustrated there stop-starting. You couple days feeling bit trouble elbow. That just frustrating. I pretty fortunate career, barring injury. Perhaps national inclination glumness leads doubt Murray week. Some say struggle up, Russian world No85, Andrey Kuznetsov, took set US Open years ago, mere games met, Beijing year. Kuznetsov pushed Wawrinka second-set tie-break losing semi-finals Geneva Friday, good shape solid clay game. Oddsmakers, unlike doomsayers, Murray 1-6.

I really sick days Miami. I bed. I could move. I sore stomach. I sweating, sore head, temperature. When I got I tests showed I suffered shingles earlier year. But I tests [in Melbourne].

As Murray explained, impossible avoid picking viruses crowded, sweaty locker rooms confined long-haul flights venues world. Yet, upbeat. There times spirit-sapping dips affect mood dramatically, marriage fatherhood noticeably changed that. His daughter, Sophia, inspiration maybe reflects little character, sure. She walking, talking little bit, said, throwing tantrums baby. The idea Murray having child throws tantrums lead-in poor punch line, insists Sophia, long turned one, gets mother, Kim. What given stability perspective. He need plenty week and, pessimists wrong, possibly next. Six-try Scarlets swept Munster meek challenge aside win one-sided Pro12 final 46-22 Aviva Stadium Dublin.

Carelessness word applied Chelsea season, champions began final little laid good. They minutes result, player season N'Golo Kant partly blame.

Courtois just routine catch Mesut zil early corner bowled ball Kant attack moving, normally reliable midfielder lose bearings just outside penalty area let Arsenal steal in. It said error led directly goal ominously lackadaisical start noted smartness precision season. By mid-point half, time Gary Cahill forced clear line zil Danny Welbeck hit post header corner, beginning look Chelsea imperious march title just illusion. It Arsne Wenger simply saving Arsenal best performance season means answering critics. The Arsenal manager struck familiar pose touchline Kant fouled Welbeck half, arms spread appeal referee, produce yellow card. Nonetheless clear Kant act desperation Chelsea forced comfort zone.

Rand Paul, candidate presidential nomination 2012, won election replace him. Unbelievable, said Eoin Morgan does usually hyperbole. Teams seldom win opposition needs 10 runs 10 balls wickets hand England managed. We decided needed wickets [before final Mark Wood] make hit ball air, explained Morgan. But did wickets managed win. Unbelievable. Wood yorkers usually good end decided raw pace. We thought bouncers best chance taking wickets. Maybe bluffed them. Morgan smile suggested sure that. It best kind victory unlikely 10 balls go. Sides cherish wins most. Ben Stokes century obviously significant remain concerns captain fitness gun all-rounder. We monitoring him, said Morgan, and managing best Champions Trophy mind. He certainly good play batsman Lord [on Monday]. It depends pulls up. But wants play. I think unless he injured risk play. If case bowling quota overs process currently gives Stokes pain. At Ageas Bowl restricted just overs. Before end I'd decided enough, said Morgan, eye Chris Woakes' fitness well. His absence precautionary do want risks him. Morgan opposite number, AB Villiers, best hide disappointment. We got bit excited end, said applauding David Miller Chris Morris taken victory. De Villiers cheerful side performance conversation umpires, Rob Bailey Chris Gaffaney, midway England innings. De Villiers candid explaining umpires felt condition balls changed. I upset that. I feeling felt responsible that. It felt accused balltampering. He added steps taken ball changed. I think just bad ball. That happens sometimes. De Villiers' sensitivity issue explained South Africa experiences winter accusations balltampering, notably Faf du Plessis Hobart Test Australia one-day series New Zealand. Du Plessis heavily fined extremely grumpy that. Moreover South Africans exactly moon losing match won. Exeter lifted Premiership trophy seven years winning promotion flight immediately turned gaze Europe. Gareth Steenson boot took Chiefs victory Bristol 2010 Championship play-off final club long-serving outside-half, lost place Henry Slade start season, levelled Saturday final Wasps penalty 30 seconds end won minutes remaining extra-time. We seven-year plan came Premiership champions, minutes I think going it, said Exeter chairman, Tony Rowe. This success confirms are, ambition now, Rob Baxter [the head coach] best Europe. Steenson said felt pressure taking kicks seven years play-off. If beaten Bristol, final, said. I said prayer old man upstairs helped one. Exeter unbeaten 17 Premiership matches winning seven. We sat harsh words spoken, said Steenson. We knew grip did. We stood performed got reward. Exeter England wing Jack Nowell, flies New Zealand Lions Monday, scored try. We wanted badly losing final year, said. We knew come fitness Wasps make tough hard work paid off. Wasps finished regular season won previous 10 finals competitions. We really good campaign I proud players, said club director rugby, Dai Young. We defeat chin make sure learn it. A brilliant, modern one-day contest ended stunning England victory runs. Just seven required David Miller Chris Morris added quickfire 55. A successful pursuit 331 obvious outcome. But happened Mark Wood dubious honour bowled final rare hostility composure. He yielded just runs balls, short fast, Morris unable hit four. He manage melancholy single. Thirty-three needed overs. Jake Ball, replacing injured Chris Woakes, unlucky bowler shredded end thrilling contest. But Wood delivered guarantee place Champions Trophy provided stays fit. There steel Eoin Morgan team. Here gave polished, professional performance, keeping head field pressure end Quinton Kock AB Villiers combined ominously South Africa run chase. Morgan icily decisive bowling changes men appeared relish challenge tight finish. There just clouds horizon. Ben Stokes, produced second ODI century, bowled just overs risked further. And suggestion team peaking little early, barely old-fashioned, superstitious observation Champions Trophy. This victory tougher achieve Headingley. Batting conditions tricky England started 11am South Africa resolute pursuit substantial target, 331. The start South Africa chase solid. They scored 56 inside 10 overs Hashim Amla nimbly caught extra cover Morgan Stokes. Faf du Plessis fell excellent Liam Plunkett De Kock De Villiers proceeded far easily home crowd comfort partnership 96. Now Plunkett telling contribution. He bowled bouncer De Villiers, correctly given wide. So delivery South Africa captain anticipated ball short one, Plunkett delivered. The ball brushed glove startled De Villiers caught Jos Buttler. De Kock soon followed, edging Moeen Ali keeper shy century, meant England finally leeway. But time South Africa lower order determined Headingley. Miller Morris swung dangerously good effect  Wood final over. Now England routinely pass 300 bat. Here despite grim, grey clouds hovering ground start relatively modest rate progress 25 overs, 120 three. This time IPL boys key contributors. Since Headingley agonizing Stokes ability bowl dodgy knee, meant quality batting overlooked. In format bats demonstrated superbly paced initially fortunate innings. His chief ally Buttler, emerged unusually unproductive spell format unbeaten 65. Hence England able knock 111 runs final 10 overs, opposed 102 managed Headingley. At moment turns up. Likewise scrutiny. Currently Jason Roy, highest score ODI innings far summer 20 Lord Ireland. Understandably regime gives players plenty rope; know Roy capacity change game 15 overs. But Roy recognize Jonny Bairstow Sam Billings happy drafted opening batsman. Here Roy played full, straight delivery Kasigo Rabada. Joe Root looked better form. He glided start England proceeded alarms 10 overs. Alex Hales fluent: dropped boundary Rabada advantage, edging keeper. No matter. Root batting exquisitely, unveiling odd ramp shot drives expertly clipped wide diving fielders. Then calamity deflated lesser side: straight drive Morgan clipped fingers bowler, Dwaine Pretorius, hit stumps Root stranded foot crease. Now Amla committed costly error flawed performance South Africa field. Stokes edged ball Keshav Maharaj, making ODI debut, passed straight hands Amla slip way boundary. Next ball edge, just thick, hit gloves De Kock. Stokes good capitalise, Morgan steady ally caught Rabada. Buttler initially sorts, timing awry, able acclimatise Stokes wake. Then crunching pull shot Andile Phehlukwayo announced magic returned. Three boundaries Buttler followed cost 22. For time ODI cricket fourth, fifth sixth wicket innings exceeded 70. Moeen scurried effectively end England  just. Amid euphoria Arsenal, bound people wonder ideal circumstances Arsne Wenger announce stepping aside assure himself happy ending. His team won, thrillingly, champions England, making Wenger successful manager history competition. It seventh victory and, faults, man record achievement surely warrants opportunity high. Equally, moments Wenger reminded football makes addictive. It easy kicking habit, particularly days falls place Arsenal undoubtedly them. They picked good time best performance season, denying Chelsea double day Victor Moses joined list players suffer indignity shown red card FA Cup final. Moses collected second-half bookings fact second came choreographed attempt win penalty probably summed state Arsenal reduced opponents. The question Wenger men this: reach heights often? Arsenal quick ball, strong tackle and, defensively, played utterly determined let fact missing key personnel influence outcome. More anything, free self-doubt infiltrated performances Chelsea. Mesut zil, instance, absolutely determined leave imprint final. Alexis Snchez, possibly making appearance Arsenal colours, shimmered menace 30 goals season. Danny Welbeck brought mix speed directness Olivier Giroud came substitute, just Diego Costa equaliser, touch set Aaron Ramsey game decisive moment. The cross delivered expertly impolite Ramsey, stooping header, accept chance. By end, starting feel like trick mind winning team actually finished 18 points Chelsea league. Costa bouncing shot briefly conjure possibility improbable comeback team 10 men. But poor day Chelsea rare N'Golo Kant, instance, finding difficult up. Ramsey winner arrived minutes Costa equaliser comes half began possibly torrid 30-minute spell Chelsea endured season. All achievement Arsenal, bearing mind issues Wenger approaching final list absentees meant Per Mertesacker start year (and appearance three-man defence). Wenger experimented Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, lingering questions fitness, left. And perplexing choice David Ospina, Wenger deciding loyalty second-choice goalkeeper leave summer leaving one, Petr Cech, stay. Unfortunately Ospina, weak attempt Costa goal, make amends later splendid save prevent player taking game extra time. A goal stage reminder Chelsea power endurance largely unwarranted Wenger exaggerating said team really won more. As was, first-half superiority brought goal Chelsea entitled question ought stood, argument offside handball Snchez position shoot. There doubt Ramsey offside position Snchez charged ball down. Yet Welshman presence mind step aside Chilean ran loose ball, firing past Thibaut Courtois outside boot, argument purely offside referee, Anthony Taylor, assistant, Gary Beswick, eventually right. The handball noticed, however, scoring early, minutes played, undoubtedly helped Arsenal settle quickly opponents. Chelsea struggles half epitomised carelessness buildup goal, Costa managed way Kant ball lost. Arsenal, contrast, used ball effectively needed brilliant clearance Gary Cahill prevent zil doubling lead Snchez led quick, incisive counterattacks. Four minutes later, Welbeck header zil corner came post, struck Ramsey chest ricocheted woodwork going goalkick. Later, zil hit post himself. Arsenal conceivably far resounding win. Chelsea lack adventure start second half remember supposed best team country and, fair Ospina, fine one-handed save period Moses. Costa challenging opponent Rob Holding, eluding equaliser, Moses deserved deception Chelsea defence strangely dishevelled Giroud crossed left, Ramsey headed difficult, acrimonious season Wenger managerial career ended happily. When, having completed 14th first-class double-century, Kumar Sangakkara finally fell, caught long-off trying stick Simon Harmer river, stage set  pitch brimful runs sun beaming  Alastair Cook just large. It Tom Curran pinned Cook  plumb walked  shortly lunch brisk 36. But boy folk parts believe Test player, Dan Lawrence, stepped in, shelved trademark extravagance ground fine day Division One leaders. Sangakkara exquisite innings hauled Surrey 369. Farming strike company man, Ravi Rampaul, Sangakkara turning singles 199, score reached searing cut splitting men deep. He 110 Stuart Meaker, batsmen reach double-figures, nibbled outside Jamie Porter, sent Amar Virdi peg cartwheeling shortly afterwards. Cook 44-ball stay, potted lovely drives, gave Essex sharp start, pinned Surrey slog afternoon session. That large thanks 18-year-old off-spinning debutant, Virdi, bowled 12 overs unchanged River End cost 22 runs. Zafar Ansari retired confident Virdi ready play first-team cricket appears right. Virdi green, beat bat drift turn, poor deliveries rare. Rory Burns persisted seven overs tea wicket forthcoming, flurry runs, apart successive silky smooth cover drives cut Ravi Bopara. After Tom Westley caught driving Sam Curran, Lawrence, capped Essex Friday England Lions time week, batted grace maturity. With pronounced trigger easy manner, quick pull powerful point. Lawrence partner Nick Browne, touch partially returned half-century season (although balls later, pulled Meaker straight midwicket), Bopara, 89. Their task imminent new ball. If Surrey leave win, make good use it. Should weather stay fair, Hampshire visit Taunton make final day. After Somerset used final 10 overs second day knock 39 target 259 win season entertaining game turning track, equation simple: Hampshire need 10 wickets, Somerset 220 runs. Hampshire better day, crazy hour lunch lost wicket. They efficiently docked Somerset tail, Liam Dawson Kyle Abbott taking wickets apiece, limit innings lead 35, chipped make 293 second innings.

Nottinghamshire inevitable march Division One continued apace Trent Bridge skittled Gloucestershire 149 (a innings lead 281) invited visitors follow-on. When did, Luke Fletcher, who, like Stuart Broad, took first-innings wickets, picked scalp Chris Dent. Kent took 205-run innings lead bowled Sussex 164 Darren Stevens taking wickets. Daryl Mitchell 161 Worcestershire 434, lead 196 Northamptonshire, reduced 53 stumps. There run-drenched day Derby, Derbyshire reached 532 eight, hundreds Billy Godleman Shiv Thakor 97 Gary Wilson, response Leicestershire 619. And rain-affected day Swansea, Durham toiled hard Glamorgan wickets, reached 220 response 342. Moving day trying stand BMW PGA Championship Saturday majority field, wind got sweltering, airless days self preservation issue day 66-man field enjoyed bogey-free round. Andrew Dodt Australia, Queenslander lives Newcastle NSW, successful afternoon produced four-under 68 add pair 70s hold lead under. He said working mental game realise added end, Sunday pairing Branden Grace South Africa, started under, held outright lead point, signed 70 seven under. You know it going tough it breezy, Dodt said. But seven holes little easier playing downwind compared days. They quite tough it wind, little easier, hit shots. The Wentworth course rebuilding reputation disastrous revamp 2009 led course widely derided unfair produced growing list no-shows leading players. With US PGA Championship expected May date 2019, goodwill needed quickly English event maintain eminence, takes new slot calendar, September likely suggestion. The early signs recouped already. This latest revamp began days Chris Wood won year tournament, greens dug up, reshaped partially rebuilt, sub-air heating installed 18 speed regulated firm fast. Twenty-nine bunkers removed survived punishing. The greens putting that good thing said Lee Westwood, making 24th appearance reckons re-learning course, experience got level-par round hanging good early damage birdies final holes. It great finish like level par. I five-under tournament, feels like it right there. The 16th gone birdie chance. I like taken traps away left-hand side. It gives fairway hit into. The green remodelled it fairer. It gives chance nearer hole, I took advantage that. The Open champion, Henrik Stenson, like Westwood, dropped shot 1st finding bunkers drive shot, let shots 4th 7th repaired damage birdies way sign 73. That gave share fifth Ireland Shane Lowry, quietly two-under 70 said hopes weather wind fourth round.

Willie Le Roux, full-back, 7/10 Had shown signs nerves recently took high ball comfortably stop Woodburn flow. The accomplished Wasps' day. Christian Wade, wing, 6/10 Barely got hands ball half  lively  given sniff space set Daly score. No evidence defensive deficiencies here. Elliot Daly, centre, 6/10 Wasps solitary Lion stepped Devoto Exeter second try. Did best make happen tried little hard Wade kick ahead fell perfectly him. Jimmy Gopperth, centre, 7/10 The player season left red-faced himself 14 different minds dropped ball. Good support line try hugely influential second half. Josh Bassett, wing, 6/10 Handling great unfortunate Daly grubber sit him, proved story afternoon. Not place star-studded backline. Danny Cipriani, fly-half, 7/10 A stuttering start showed class delayed pass buildup Gopperth try. Wasps needed score point delivered. Much composed break. Dan Robson, scrum-half, 7/10 A bit jittery, seen pass straight Williams, hand Gopperth away Wasps try. Improved realised patience virtue. Matt Mullan, prop, 5/10 A couple carries fighting uphill battle mighty Chiefs' scrum. Was ready willing replace Moore extra time  conceded crucial penalty end. Tommy Taylor, hooker, 8/10 Missed Leicester deserved recall. Constantly head hurts 10 tackles half alone. Point certainly proved watching Eddie Jones. Phil Swainston, prop, 5/10 Outgunned scrum time Moon  endure fate season  half-time head injury. Not best way end Wasps career. Joe Launchbury, lock, captain, 8/10 Does lead Churchillian prose fight beaches, asked. No surprise tackler. Simply deserve losing side. Matt Symons, lock, 6/10 Quietly goes business Launchbury gets usual super-human work. All proved shrewd acquisition Wasps. James Haskell, flanker, 7/10 A couple dreadful early knock-ons tried hardest make flying tackles. Once gathered himself, Wasps followed shows leader side. Thomas Young, flanker, 5/10 Caught Nowell opening try. He superb season European quarter-final sides hardly room gallop in. Nathan Hughes, No8, 9/10 A remarkable showing.

Undone horrible bounce Daly try and, try might, struggled involve himself second half. Busy extra time, though. Gareth Steenson, fly-half, captain, 8/10 Stood barrage Hughes well-timed hit Wade brought respite just half-time. Like Gopperth, flawless tee  eventually hero. Stuart Townsend, scrum-half, 6/10 An assured performance began season loan Cornish Pirates, box kick aside. Does mind getting stuck in, either. Ben Moon, prop, 7/10 One Exeter Originals, caused Swainston manner problems scrum. Such effective weapon considering important attacking lineouts Chiefs. Luke Cowan-Dickie, hooker, 6/10 Not conspicuous semi relishes physical stuff plenty that. Not eye-catching performance opposite number solid enough. Harry Williams, prop, 7/10 Excelled Sarries picked left off. A classy scrummager showed loose, too. Could rough diamond Eddie Jones looking summer. Dave Dennis, lock, 5/10 Unheralded Exeter engine room, understated standards quiet afternoon Australian. Replaced hour. Geoff Parling, lock, 9/10 Such lineout nous. Pinched just half-time reliable Exeter throw. Will missed Chiefs Premiership. So spirited throughout. Colossal. Kai Horstmann, flanker, 7/10 Another Exeter unsung heroes, particularly defence Wasps start second half. Made 14 tackles 53 minutes pitch.

Deep down, though, knew work highly respected Bertrand Valcin coaching group making difference. But know French lessons remain robust competition. She need worried. It helped started well, running PB 13.31 100m hurdles score 1,081 points, despite clipping hurdles. As saw time hand mouth shock huge smile broke out. It day. Next high jump.

They widely perceived throw ball set-piece, driving maul physicality wins matches. Their opening try perfect illustration. Wasps anticipating trademark wraparound play lineout; instead Luke Cowan-Dickie turned ball inside unstoppable fellow Cornishman Jack Nowell. Slick, crafty effective. These Chiefs far just wholehearted triers. Even talented players immune Cup final jitters. Danny Cipriani kicked failed penalty touch settling oil wheels Wasps' free-running midfield. Even Jimmy Gopperth, Premiership player year, went kick ball, changed mind ended throwing straight floor him. Henry Slade, rightly lauded wonderful long touch-finder semi-final Saracens, tried trick fatally overcooked it. It stiff breeze. When British Irish Lions fly Monday Nowell Elliot Daly need assistance climbing plane steps 100-minute marathon. Both, least, excellent form, having scored try apiece shown strong contenders Test places New Zealand; Nowell ability break tackles gainline pop anywhere, Daly pace all-round footballing qualities. James Haskell, injured Billy Vunipola, inexhaustible couple times ball reached failed Wasps prime attacking positions. Wasps finished regular season Premiership table ahead Exeter glorious days like impossible argue return first-past-the-post determining champion team. A sun-splashed grand final, enthralled kids, genuine sense occasion rival supporters sitting united friendly rivalry. Professional sport tribal losing sense humour perspective; ways club grand final accurate reflection English rugby Twickenham international. What final, kept saying, right, finals are. Folk late noted need play-offs more, stretch domestic season 10 months, smoothing crinkly weekends overlap international game. Yes will. This addictive. To Twickenham high May English club rugby best, reason think different high June. This time, apparently time, superb, attack-minded teams cut differing ways, Exeter thumping Wasps guts, Wasps unpicking Exeter muscle. Twenty-two rounds scarcely separate regular season, 80 minutes chance. For second time finals, extra-time. Had to? It pleasure. In end, relentless pressure Exeter prevailed pressure-point stings Wasps. One cruel penalties scrum, albeit yielded wave wave Exeter attack, allowed Gareth Steenson convert winning penalty 98th minute, shy full, extra-time-fuelled 100. The identity winners, though, occasion this. In time, celebrate achievements Exeter, Championship Champions seven years, celebrate day. English rugby rude health. Eighty thousand Twickenham thing, deafening noise tribal, now-famous Tomahawk Chop lent edge omen arena like this, Wasps' single-syllable reply reminiscent Iceland war chant popularised football World Cup, albeit speed. And speed field, Wasps' deadly, Exeter relentless. But, Wasps obviously lacking department physicality backs. Exeter heavy-duty three-quarters, particularly centres, constantly lookout chances run smaller men, far away. Both sides errors match pacy entertaining dared hope. Wasps, though, noticeably nervier half. Exeter capitalised early dominance, handsomely liked. When Jack Nowell worked clean lineout, knew long touched going stopped. Then Ollie Devoto, biggest three-quarter lot, steamed Wasps' midfield feed Phil Dollman, steamed wide defence line. Exeter know big-stage nerves rookie team half, having year final. They recovered second half fall short, knew expect Wasps comeback second half. It came sooner that, Jimmy Gopperth streaked stroke half-time Wasps classic. The phenomenal Nathan Hughes, Wasps player physicality Exeter struggled contain, paved way one, just break, brushing Exeter defenders merely irritating. Then deadly little weapons Wasps' armoury, Christian Wade right, bounce kick favouring Elliot Daly. Tries half-time  All Blacks, stuff champions. For 20 minutes, Exeter finish final started year  bag nerves  steeled clock wound up. An extraordinary 34-phase passage ought yielded points 10 minutes normal time remaining, wait Hughes, people, offered Steenson chance nerveless be. He took draw Exeter level death. The Chiefs' physicality started tell. Wasps' props labouring, Matt Mullan having come stricken Marty Moore, suffering himself. The thought occurred accept uncontested scrums, meant going 14 men, regulations decree. But chose soldier on, noblest tradition. It cost them. Their pain indescribable, Exeter euphoria likewise, corollary final point. The final itself thing. To win one, nerve champions, matter finish league. And rest relish occasion kings. Long reign. A final prolific teams Premiership decided kick try. Gareth Steenson penalty minutes end extra time Wasps, lost tight-head props injury, infringed scrum seventh time settled full-blooded scrappy encounter resulted Exeter crowned champions seven years day won promotion Premiership. Exeter played season, looking dominate set pieces, retain possession opponents chokehold. They enjoyed 68% possession territory final Wasps attempted 326 tackles Chiefs' 141, 90 seconds losing normal time Nathan Hughes, forceful ball-carrying helped haul Wasps game trailed 14-3 inside opening 30 minutes, penalised playing ball ruck having told referee JP Doyle let go. Hughes hear instruction end match played humid day sets supporters tried out-shout throughout. Thinking come surely match-winning turnover, pain face saw Doyle raise arm 35 metres Wasps' posts greater shown various opponents England No8 run course match left flat turf. Hughes started match intent leaving calling card Exeter players appeared waned leaving field treatment injured shoulder. He helped lead time minutes interval run reminiscent Jonah Lomu pomp, defenders bouncing went high low. Wasps hauled contention match throwing away opening half. Exeter built lead exquisitely executed moves set pieces: first, 13 minutes, came lineout penalty kicked touch. Kai Horstmann secured ball hooker, Luke Cowan-Dickie, ran collect ball, Wasps braced driving maul. Cowan-Dickie headed midfield, taking guard lineout, Thomas Young saw, late, Jack Nowell making run inside pass. The England Lions wingtook ball pace unstoppable run line Wasps, moves ended knock-one misplaced passes, barely recovered Ollie Devoto outside break scrum slipped ball hand Phil Dollman. They tries precision simplicity Wasps preferred detailed embroidery, pining sublime moments injured Kurtley Beale provided. They uncharacteristically squandering overlaps trying force play team fertilised errors when, just Jimmy Gopperth penalty possession, conjured final second opening half. Danny Cipriani, struggled touch part, cut defence Tommy Taylor Dan Robson pull defence way send Gopperth posts cut Exeter lead points wiping restart Hughes ran 22 halfway plundered turnover led Christian Wade chipping line. Dollman, Exeter line defence, floor run Hughes suffering ankle injury rule Wales summer tour. Steenson tried cover ground, bounce ball left stranded, Elliot Daly picked ahead. Suddenly Wasps control, Gopperth second penalty 54 minutes giving cushion. Exeter looked it, dangerous. They remained strong set-pieces ended Wasps' run 17 unanswered points Steenson penalty 63 minutes. It proved momentum shift; Wasps settled all-out defence Exeter taken play 31 phases declined kickable penalty levelled scores repelled second scrum, trophy looked like sent Coventry. Then Hughes overstepped fine line separates turnover penalty, tough afternoon Doyle given sides licence compete ball. It meant second Premiership final extra-time Chiefs dominated 20 minutes. Sam Simmonds, match-winner Saracens semi-final, denied try review kick-off Steenson Gopperth beckoned scrum collapsed minutes go. Wasps lost tight-head props injury. As Exeter tight-head Tomas Francis knee hit floor, Matt Mullan blamed scrum going stepped Steenson, Chief years, unerringly ball middle posts complete unlikely story leave Wasps reflect cruelty come finish second. If claims winning trophies Scotland akin defeating hamster chess, Scottish Cup final used perfect counter-point. The scale Celtic celebrations Tom Rogic guided club, Brendan Rodgers, uncharted territory told story toil come before. Rodgers Celtic, now-famous Celtic side, completed unbeaten domestic season. It took titanic battle Aberdeen Celtic complete clean sweep domestic trophies. Rodgers manager club illustrious history win treble. It was, though, impossible feel sorry Derek McInnes Aberdeen, contributed final quality  fitness  told. Rogic strode forward midfield stoppage time proved act campaign, Australian low finish Joe Lewis near post precursor outright delirium Aberdeen contingent sank knees en masse dismay. This great day club, said Rodgers. I elated, incredible feeling. Maybe stars aligned Celtic season, do wrong: earned it. McInnes, Aberdeen manager, hide upset. We I gutted players supporters, said. We played great final. Jayden Stockley displayed robust approach surprisingly earned Aberdeen starting berth 21 minutes. His arm caught Kieran Tierney mouth technical area, young Celtic full-back immediately distress. After lengthy delay, account considerable bleeding, Tierney game over. Replays inconclusive regarding Stockley illegal  elbow certainly flailing  player himself knowing element intent. Tierney returned raise Scottish Cup alongside team-mates, rousing ovation. By point Tierney exit teams traded goals. This breathless, brilliantly entertaining stuff, Aberdeen using early stages demonstrate cowed Celtic lofty status. The Premiership champions rattled half juncture domestic season. The 12 teams score Scottish Cup final ultimately won game. Jonny Hayes provided men north-east hope, having raced Niall McGinn corner send first-time shot past despairing Tierney line Celtic net. Leigh Griffiths woefully lazy allowing Hayes beat ball; matter Celtic striker visibly apologised goalkeeper, Craig Gordon, aftermath. Celtic response instant. Aberdeen properly halt Callum McGregor run, ball breaking Stuart Armstrong 22 yards goal. The midfielder took couple steps forward taking advantage sluggish Shay Logan defending picking spot. Aberdeen confidence blunted Celtic intervention remained better team interval. Gordon batted away efforts McGinn Ryan Jack doing likewise net-bound Andy Considine header. Yet, curiously, Celtic rued worst miss opening 45 minutes, Scott Sinclair tremendous Griffiths cross yards goal. Sinclair, prolific season Scotland, scooped ball crossbar. Griffiths shot deflected narrowly wide, minutes restart, Celtic looked assert superior talent. That signal onslaught, though; Aberdeen passed glorious opportunity Hayes agonisingly failed onrushing free Kenny McLean cut-back. With 15 minutes play, fatigue set Aberdeen. Celtic spent closing stages laying siege opponents' goal. Sinclair fluffed lines handed simple chance team front. Strangely, match edging extra time potency required, Rodgers resisted temptation introduce fit Moussa Dembl replacements. As virtually happened arrived Glasgow, Rodgers proven right. Rogic, himself substitute, left Aberdeen defenders slipstream. Celtic long exactly rest Scottish football. With riders grouped inside 90 seconds standings going Sunday final time trial, 100th Giro d'Italia set provide tightest finish great Tours. The Colombian Nairo Quintana wears pink leader jersey mountain stage, breathing neck men: defending champion, Vincenzo Nibali, France Thibaut Pinot Dutchman Tom Dumoulin.

There, Pinot looked strongest, eventually taking stage win making escape Quintana, Nibali, Pozzovivo Zakarin. Dumoulin rode perfect race however, remaining touch actual contact, second group riders; eventually lost 15 seconds, Pinot received 10 second bonus stage win prove vital. The gold standard suspense three-week Tour remains Greg LeMond eight-second victory final stage 1989 Tour France, provide similar. That see-sawing two-way fight Laurent Fignon, subtly different four-way contest, scenario organisers barely dreamed torpid week racing favourites observed closely. The race took shape time trial stage Umbria Dumoulin gained time climbers obvious carve substantial advantage going Sunday time trial. He backed hilltop stage win Saturday, opening gap minutes.

Nevertheless, absence Serena Williams, wildcard Maria Sharapova interim world No1, Angelique Kerber, prone jitters, Konta mainly herself clay underfoot worry about. To slip debilitating habits consumed struggling make living add meagre collection points ranking total. It took years break 100, June 2014, just months make 50. Once struck winning rhythm, self-belief soared. After moving inside world 30, January year, blossomed. She 20 mid-summer cracked 10 time October. Three weeks ago, hit career-high No 6, slipped places since. Most success come hard courts clay chosen surface does fear it. As said drawn play Taiwan Hsieh Su-wei round: A big challenge time I spend surface, compared ones. Elite athletes love comfort familiarity. They fear abhor change. But Konta learning adapt. It just I have played clay, says. Obviously I past  it level players I playing surface, I have experience in. That time factor. However, game style, it adaptation process. Noticing how, example, hard court, movement way you able ball early. Your general movement ball slightly straightforward clay. I just need adapting well, movement-wise ball. Also, patient build. The points bit longer here. The balls play differently court. Technically dry, perhaps, toweringly important highest level. Konta machine, though. She talks animatedly gelato Rome terre battue Paris. She loves food, music driving new sponsored car. But keeps eye competitive circuits years. Everyone dangerous. Everyone vulnerable. Nerves abound.

Kerber, ought logical pick is  partly does like clay, mainly form reliable opinion poll  said felt not bad. Having endured humiliation bagel recently, added: It different grand slams. Always.

A long afternoon Monte Carlo lies store Lewis Hamilton. A circuit loves drive offer little pleasure British driver Sunday. That qualified 14th torrid session knocked Q2 shock three-times world champion greater concern inability work far pace. Kimi Raikkonen secured pole Monaco, feat rolled years Finn. It time claimed spot years, France 2008 stint Ferrari. But Hamilton experience correspondingly unfamiliar. This time final qualifying pace Italian Grand Prix 2013. He struggled grip throughout, unable tyres correct temperature operating window final hot lap Q2 stymied yellow flags, barely looked like make final shootout clearly disappointed. I devastated session, said Hamilton, start 13th Jenson Button demotion grid. To point I car. Overtaking hard Monaco year difficult season wider cars, Hamilton acknowledged. That pretty weekend done, added. I try 10 nice Sunday drive I imagine. It major blow championship fight Ferrari Sebastian Vettel, took second grid, time Scuderia locked row Monte Carlo Jody Scheckter took pole alongside Gilles Villeneuve 1979. Vettel advantage points expect extend significantly Sunday afternoon. Of greater weight, however, enduring implications expected season-long battle. Hamilton team-mate Valtteri Bottas difficulty tyres, grid two-thousandths Vettel. In Russia Hamilton similarly struggled Finn machinery took pole win. The Mercedes executive director, Toto Wolff, admitted team adapting season Pirelli rubber. It bit diva right window, said car. Hamilton said: We similar scenario Sochi, particularly I hope discover issue moving forward. It strange thing, case going lap. The car able work I ca were able feels like mystery currently understand it difficult. Raikkonen ride just liking final quick lap masterful, whisker walls, middle sector particular strong Vettel answer. In contrast, Hamilton struggle grip balance evident off, six-tenths Red Bull Max Verstappen 10th opening session. It clear Q2 pulled big save holding rear going Casino Square  cost shot quick time.

Watford new head coach, Marco Silva, insisted ambition club owners excites him. The Pozzo family record firing managers regularity, Hull man ninth incumbent takeover Vicarage Road years ago. Quique Snchez Flores Walter Mazzarri given season just keeping club flight save sack. It approach does intimidate Silva, left Hull failing despite impressing months charge. Firstly, I really like approach board owner, told club website. They showed project I like ambition. I excited. It good challenge I really happy. The club want improve seasons I try fight career  improve, good job ensure good connection manager club. The ambition club really important me. Snchez Flores guided Watford 13th FA Cup semi-final regressed Mazzarri, finishing 17th losing matches season. Silva knows improve that. It important everybody knows goal is, added Portuguese, signed two-year contract. The club moving forward Premier League club, want improve position table that important season. We want play good football, fans feel come team play. We work hard day prepare matches best game. The Watford chairman chief executive, Scott Duxbury, believes club stolen march rivals securing services Olympiakos Sporting Lisbon coach. Marco sought-after head coaches Premier League, said. His pedigree promise speaks itself, achievements divisions Europe work Hull season. We delighted secured services welcoming head coach profile potential. It exciting time Watford fan I sure supporters join offering Marco family warmest welcomes Vicarage Road. The symbolism hang heavily air Wembley Sunday afternoon. At end ground, sea red white offer perfect demonstration positives achieved supporters say running club. Facing followers Exeter City, however, swaths seats Blackpool section tell sorry story happens football fans pushed far. The League Two play-off final pits supporter-owned club disenfranchised fans fed people charge boycotting Blackpool biggest match season. For Blackpool fans painful choice stay away Wembley, winning promotion League One secondary importance compared onerous task getting Oyston family Bloomfield Road. There argument ought protests day. Yet vowed penny Oystons, stewardship club caused anger, purchasing ticket akin abandoning cause. Their relationship Karl Oyston, chairman, father, Owen, damaged repair soon pair launched libel cases dissenting supporters. In better times, queue ticket office snaked Bloomfield Road. Blackpool took 37,000 fans Wembley beat Cardiff City Championship play-off final 2010 30,000 lost West Ham years later. They sold 5,000 time. There plenty Oyston Out scarves ground, Andy Higgins, member Blackpool Supporters' Trust, says. Most think you going finance family, intent suing supporters, you financing litigation. That went far. Litigation fans pale. While BST frustrated attempts host big screen event, likely busy afternoon pubs Blackpool. But mixed emotions game begins. Some supporters want Blackpool win despite acrimony. Others believe victory strengthen Oystons' position. That creates division people support team cases owners, Tim Fielding, BST honorary vice-president, says. But best club served owners selling up. I do think promotion facilitate that. I spoke Owen spoke fans Blackpool Hilton summer. I repeatedly asked stop suing fans consult BST. And wo it, people money. There are exceptions Wembley. It taken lot radicalise Oystons managed it. We seen vanguard protest movement fit proper owners. We work closely Leyton Orient, Charlton Coventry. How BST love emulate Exeter model. It 14 years Exeter City Supporters' Trust took over, following relegation Football League owners left club brink financial ruin, Paul Tisdale, Exeter manager, calls trust bubble rotten industry. Arsne Wenger manager working English game job longer Tisdale. Exeter November Tisdale given time revive team. Martin Weiler, ECST chairman, says: We steadily 3,000 members that withstood peaks troughs form. What benefit enormous outpouring volunteering. For semi-finals, team volunteers came trained ticketing. We pop-up store middle Exeter selling merchandise final. That spirit worth awful lot financially culturally reinforces sense ownership. It club. Why would help it? Blackpool fans forced help club different ways. The BST protests outside home game lead disputes supporters heading ground. There issues online. There made-up user names social media vilify trust, Higgins says. Nobody knows people are, coming saying witnessed verbal abuse intimidation. The BST look Exeter wonder. Scenarios like paid argument football fans know nothing, Fielding says. It time there radical overhaul country fans boardroom. Making history target Fernando Alonso takes track 101st running Indianapolis 500 Sunday afternoon. The Spaniard wants win Brickyard step closer claiming motor racing triple crown Indy formidable challenge just making finish attempt achievement. One team-mates making Indy 500 debut Britain Jack Harvey just taking track alongside childhood hero stuff dreams. Alonso dominated headlines Indy year ducking Sunday Monaco Grand Prix race Andretti team, heartily tired uncompetitive McLaren, PR masterstroke. Already winner Monaco, Alonso clear desire add Indy Le Mans tally match Graham Hill, driver won three. Alonso decision switch series unusual garner huge attention. For Alonso rookie test Brickyard, million fans tuned watch live streaming, keenly aware task facing Alonso Harvey. Dismissing 500 miles super speedway simply turning left 200 laps nonsense. Anyone finally gets swig bottle milk pace car home truly earned it. Sbastien Bourdais, F1 driver multiple Champ Car champion, knows way round oval crashed qualifying sustained multiple fractures. The cars run turns entry speeds 230mph little downforce possible. It dangerous combination. Across 2.5-mile lap characteristics corners, degree banking length, differ widely. On entry corner rear end moves around. At two, unprotected stands, wind plays role affecting delicate balance required. On outside wall, close make drivers hold breath comes close. Alonso taken Indy cars well, acknowledging challenge. It place weeks, four-corner circuit, repeat laps exactly conditions, wind, traffic, said. Every lap there, need learning. He quick practice, shot pole mechanical problem starts fifth grid Sunday. And rookie Alexander Rossi proved year, win race mix come final 50 laps. Alonso faces tough field: seven previous winners Sunday grid. Among field 24-year-old Harvey, debut Indianapolis fanfare, equally special experience. I aware it biggest races world, says.

Harvey, too, reminded risks crash practice conservative targets, aiming best rookie spot (a task require finish higher Alonso least) knows mix important. Absolutely I win, says. If falls way, win race. Alexander showed year possible running end. Harvey start 27th 32-car grid, grabs Brickyard. Everybody opportunity win everybody hopes happen them, says. If comes way I it. That commitment guarantee strongly shared childhood hero. Jenson Button set start final Formula One race hit 15-place grid penalty Monaco Grand Prix.

Double world champion Alonso McLaren cockpit round Canada. The Spaniard start fifth rookie appearance Indy 500 Sunday. The clearly huge difference, Antonio Conte man-management, Eden Hazard asked March biggest difference Chelsea season Chelsea last, spoke automisation. Conte determined shape right, means long hours training pitch, playing opposition. So central shadow play Conte method Italy practised Euro 2016, smallest core coaching staff sent away details precisely doing leak out. Arrigo Sacchi devotee shadow play introduced idea Milan, response bewilderment. On match days, morning, Sacchi said, we special training session. [The Real Madrid striker Emilio] Butragueo told that, [1989 European Cup] semi-final, sent scout watch session. The scout reported back: They played game 11 full-sized pitch ball!' We line formation, I tell players imaginary ball players accordingly, passing imaginary ball moving like clockwork pitch, based players' reactions. Yet idea long pre-dates Sacchi. Conte Chelsea win league title using default formation Everton 1962-63, adept playing using English innovation early sixties, developed Burnley, Sunderland Sheffield Wednesday manager Alan Brown. Born Corbridge Northumberland, Brown soon demonstrated ascetic streak. Aged 16, ran 17 miles Tyne Newcastle, rested minutes ran back, effort improve fitness prepared life professional footballer. As centre-half Huddersfield, Burnley Notts County, developed reputation toughness honesty. Brown set restaurant Burnley playing career coming end worked briefly policeman named Burnely manager 1954. There established strong youth set-up, oversaw development training complex edge town, helping physical work himself, insisting players share. You lived fear need really genuine, nice guy, said Jimmy Nelson, left-back played Sunderland. He kept strict ship. We'd Seaburn beach we'd training skins January  I do think bibs invented then. He'd training till water lapped ankles. We individual baths  slipper baths called  you'd end sharing wanted wait. We'd race ground straight just thaw out. Brown insisted players dress smartly hair short. He broke family holiday Bude Cornwall drive night intercept Brian Clough persuade sign Middlesbrough set cruise Southampton. He just Clough manager mentor. He influence Lawrie McMenemy, Don Revie Malcolm Allison. Brown stopped thinking new methods training. One summer, walked Pennine Way alone. When returned, he'd filled series notebooks plans free-kick corner routines. Not ideas successful  Nelson remembers players practice heading golf-balls, insisting would hurt technique right  book Team Coach makes clear innovative thinker was, far ahead game. Long Pep Guardiola Barcelona, advocate known rondos (a pig-in-the-middle game passing ball past defenders circle) way improving maintenance possession. Long common Brown insisted warm-ups, explaining conducted dressing room impossible use pitch. A rhyme, said, chanted warm-ups maintain rhythm help morale: When I laddie I lived Grannie hiding Grannie gae me, noo mannie, I hammer Grannie  serves right hammering me. (variants, presumably, available uncomfortable north-eastern dialect). Brown developed early, slightly complex form Guardiola calls juego posicin. Imagining team playing 4-2-4, paired left-winger right-sided centre-back, left-sided centre-forward right-back vice-versa. When players ball, encouraged partner midfield offer option short pass, place taken nearest player line, place taken midfielders, creating triangular flow movement disrupt opposing marking systems maintaining basic 4-2-4 shape. A scheme like that, though, work players comfortable shape  shadow play comes in. Unlike Sacchi, Brown use ball, principle  playing movement shape right. With shadow play, said, players become imaginative ball selective passing certainly, keener perception reading colleagues' movements. The points robotic level automatisation, use Hazard term, permitted improvisation disruptive overall shape. Brown want puppets, seeking direction bench. The players run show, explained, and, decisions movement field response rest team. It idea 50 years old Chelsea success shows it extremely relevant today. Not long Eddie Jones appointed England called meeting RFU address dearth openside flankers. Publicly, played need specialist No7 privately lamenting absence. I said: I ca natural sevens England,' recalled Jones week. Richard Hill, however, casting net afield. England World Cup-winning flanker, team manager time responsible identifying developing young players, aware Sam Underhill, under-18 national captain moved Cardiff study join Ospreys Gloucester. Steadily, come public consciousness  Underhill having agreed leave Ospreys early join Bath summer  Jones able select him. Unsurprisingly, immediately, starting Barbarians Sunday promising showing likely lead cap Argentina. I remember having meeting under-age coaches went players available Hilly said: You got bloke play.' And right, Jones said. I went visited months, just chat him, just he to. I did beg come England he got want play England. He just matter finding best way. The Ospreys fantastic this. Underhill 20 degree hype is, arguably, type player England Neil Back alongside Hill. Comparably, water Wales. Sam Warburton Justin Tipuric, Underhill team-mate Ospreys, leading lights pecking order Ellis Jenkins Thomas Young. James Davies summer tour despite magnificent performance Scarlets' Pro12 semi-final win Leinster. England, now, opted abrasive flankers Jones  Chris Robshaw moving No6 James Haskell playing No7  nullify threat players mould Steffon Armitage David Pocock. Armitage unavailable Jones does face Underhill Baa-Baas Jones like saw Matt Kvesic Will Fraser  English options specialist sevens. Robshaw, co-captains side, line Underhill knows thing wearing No7 jersey England. Playing different league I had seen Sam looks pretty strong, confident wanting ball, said. He good addition squad. Eighteen wins trot suggest Jones approach two sixandahalves worked England Haskell Billy Vunipola Wales Six Nations, doubting dominated back-row battle Ireland trio came Dublin. So Underhill missing link Jones England? He definitely going add he just starting, Jones said. He start potentially Test career I expect fundamentals well, make tackles, clear-outs link player impressed. He got nice mature way him, hard worker field really standout impression days here. Any kid goes leaves club England guaranteed progression through, goes Wales, fights way gets Ospreys, got him. It wrong suggest Jones pinning hopes Underhill. There uncapped players starting Twickenham Saturday seven bench, including Sale 18-year-old flanker Tom Curry, late replacement twin brother, Ben. They going stick it, stick basics game, Jones said. They got good work ethics, love game want better. We turned batch. I took ashtanga yoga 2002, just death dad. My mum bought book token birthday written love Mum  I sure Dad too. I wanted parting gift help remember him. I Waterstones book called Power Yoga Beryl Bender Birch grabbed attention immediately. That book changed life. I stopped practising yoga since. There forms yoga, ashtanga physical. It involves set series movements  time  takes just hour complete. (Though days, I have got time, I just I can.) You holding posture deep breaths, moving one. That appealed ashtanga: start, right finish. There lot postures through, it quite demanding. I seen gym-oriented people ashtanga yoga class surprised physical is. You using muscles, including ones do realise you got. It great way fit. I muscular I stronger, especially upper body, arms back. Ashtanga yoga requires continuous deep breathing maintain way series; it actually important maintain breath postures themselves. The spiritual yoga overemphasised people off, yoga helps clear mind. Some people sit meditate, that me. I physical focus quieten inner voice. When husband died 2008, aged 43, I hit rock bottom. Yoga thing I managed hold to. You feel distraught, drown you.

Roughead converted tough set shot 50m arc 80 seconds remaining Hawks triumphed 12.9 (81) 11.9 (75). The visitors looked track comfortable victory earlier game, Swans launched barnstorming comeback quarter. Sydney led seven points late final term kicking consecutive goals, run Lance Franklin started trademark showstopper outside 50m arc. Shaun Burgoyne, slotted second astonishing goal night, Roughead ensured final twist. Franklin, booted goals, awarded Goodes-O'Loughlin medal best ground. Franklin Burgoyne wearing No 67 recognise 50th anniversary referendum landmark achievement Indigenous Australians. Both stepped superbly Indigenous Round. Franklin moves 10th list VFL/AFL goalkickers lifting career tally 819. He dished handful goals, pressure acts influential Swans' stirring third-quarter fightback. The Swans, coming consecutive six-day breaks, rallied despite having fit men bench. Jake Lloyd knocked early quarter, Sam Reid failed concussion test slung ground Burgoyne second term. It spiteful match, Sydney Zak Jones players sides likely sweat match review panel findings. Dan Hannebery Josh Kennedy tallied combined 68 disposals Swans, Liam Shiels laid 10 tackles 31 possessions Hawks. It satisfying backs wall challenged, Hawks coach Alastair Clarkson said. We lost close game similar circumstances Collingwood week. We pretty good clutch games recent times. Clarkson praise leaders Burgoyne, Roughead Luke Hodge charge Franklin. Sometimes it little bit hard admire you opposition coach, Clarkson said. He consistently does brilliant things. Swans counterpart John Longmire agreed Franklin enormous. Longmire cut desolate figure game, Swans slipping win-loss record 3-7 upset. We courageous efforts (when fit men bench second half) ... unfortunately enough, said. We did play footy wanted to. But coach reluctant criticise players, given taxing contest was. You say is, said, asked message team was. There huge efforts second half ... unfortunately hold on. Some blokes dug competed, pushed absolute limits, Longmire said. However, Swans physically mentally exhausted final minutes game  showed. They failed man mark correctly Jarryd Roughead match-winner tick minute remaining. That chance come reigning Rising Star winner Callum Mills turned ball instead having shot Swans front. We things we'd probably better opportunity to, minutes, Longmire said. Whether fatigued could think clearly, could (physically) quite distance kick, probably couple things together.

The left-back, Kieran Gibbs, struggling thigh problem. Wenger major doubt concerns Shkodran Mustafi, suffered concussion Premier League win home Sunderland, centre-half expected fit Wembley. Two centre-backs  Laurent Koscielny Gabriel Paulista  suspension knee ligament damage respectively, Wenger set turn Per Mertesacker position. Mertesacker returned action substitute home win Everton Sunday nearly 13 months knee injury. Mertesacker said never played three. He added: When I young, I started position 15 years. Everyone starts zero new system. Am I able play 90 minutes? I tell you. I have played year. But I 15 years, I expect myself absolutely ready, matter comes. I going it. I owe team club. I want make sure I ready mind-set 120 minutes, plus penalties. Wenger suggested Wednesday start Cech Ospina, despite having favoured back-up goalkeeper FA Cup runs. Ospina played Arsenal Champions League ties season, plus rounds FA Cup. Wenger stressed Cech, No1, started semi-final win Manchester City month. Will Cech play Chelsea? It possible, Wenger said. We see. Ospina, expected leave club summer, chance. As stands verge history, Brendan Rodgers urged Sunderland Derek McInnes, key figure standing Celtic unprecedented achievement. Should Celtic Aberdeen Saturday Scottish Cup final, complete unbeaten domestic season trophy treble. Intriguingly, Rodgers used pre-match media duties speak effusively McInnes, Aberdeen manager features list candidates replace David Moyes Stadium Light. A historic connection Sunderland chief executive, Martin Bain, pertinent regards McInnes, relatively paltry compensation payment region 500,000. I saw [link] week I think absolutely perfect it, said Rodgers. It big club change needs organise, big club Derek big clubs. He England difficult time gets great job Aberdeen, big job. He in, bit life, organised. He knows game, engage players, motivate players. The Championship tough league. I got promoted Swansea 46 games graft work commitment. It brilliant wanted certainly club magnitude  big club, Sunderland  perfect. The difficult time Rodgers referred Bristol City, sacked McInnes January 2013. The Rangers West Bromwich Albion midfielder aspirations return England stage. However Friday McInnes played switch Stadium Light. It has distraction, said. I protective career. There opportunities past I real rush leave Aberdeen. If continue jobs opportunities future, lot things right consider leaving. I bad decision leaving St Johnstone Bristol City. The immediate task hand relates Aberdeen, beaten times Celtic season, including League Cup final, lost 3-0, prevent Rodgers manager club history deliver treble. I do think that, said Rodgers. I think after, happens. If does, great. If does, it OK, I best. We year try thing. History judges manager player. I just hope time here, season beyond, I best. It brilliant season, matter result is. The club going direction. Rodgers added fit-again Moussa Dembl squad, French striker having recovered hamstring injury picked semi-final win Rangers. The likelihood, though, in-form Leigh Griffiths start attack. Arsne Wenger forthcoming media conferences time regulars travel Arsenal training ground St Albans say particularly guarded big game. This week exception. But FA Cup final Chelsea Saturday, manager brought extra ingredients  exasperation, defiance series digs; veiled, equivalent going two-footed. Take related Tony Adams. The club captain new book out, led headline Wenger could coach way paper bag. Understandably, went badly him. Adams writes FA Cup final 2001, Arsenal lost Liverpool and, according him, Wenger threw runners-up medal bin dressing room. I do remember [that], Wenger said. Do trust Tony Adams says. Wenger reheated recent bug-bear segued apocalyptic vision football coming decades. Maybe we robot bench make decisions analyse exactly decisions makes game, said. You human beings bench anymore. On 9 May, Wenger talked time computers come replace managers. Maybe computers manager analyse game and, straightaway, pushes button and, game, comes team game, said. Arsenal come rely, increasingly, analytics  approach driven chief executive, Ivan Gazidis  sits easily Wenger, come look old school. At heart Wenger notion control, end surely divisive season career difficult paint embattled point paranoia. The issue stays goes month, expiry contract, allowed cast long shadows campaign drive supporters distraction. But Wenger misery Cup final. There dodge question reiterations fought final day contracts. This me, said, sighing and, again, plain incredulity subject discussion which, itself, incredible. I focus football, said. One big problems modern society big companies sit make decisions good company popular not? I do care that. I just want make decision  right wrong, good not? All rest artificial debate. Wenger believes merit new two-year deal table early months season. He talked Cup final zero bearing decision intention carry manager season, Arsenal elsewhere. Wenger addicted job. To mind, 75 points respectable tally finish Premier League season just Arsenal misfortune that, time, clubs collected more. And finish trophy. Believe me, 18 managers league like position Saturday, Wenger said. The omerta Wenger position has, unsurprisingly, extended dressing room. Danny Welbeck, Per Mertesacker Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain asked week said, variously, idea want comment. Mertesacker typically strident view. You let use excuses environment manager future, said. This approach team approach. This excuse. We look mirror what us. Welbeck Oxlade-Chamberlain clear determined win Cup, short way making failure secure top-four finish Champions League football season. But carry hope Wembley, largely stability shown Wenger switch 3-4-2-1 formation Middlesbrough 17 April. They won matches  lone reverse derby Tottenham Hotspur. The Cup final likely decided Wenger patched-up rearguard contend Diego Costa, Eden Hazard & Co. Over years, played certain formation I think teams better learning deal us, Oxlade-Chamberlain said. When changed formation, gave new think results started coming. Mertesacker said: We feel compact accepting [of need] just defend. With four, felt ball, play, press. But especially Man City [in Cup semi-final], allowed just defend box open much. You adjust. Whatever necessary Arsenal, it. The summer certain bring challenges impression club buffeted uncertainty. Alexis Snchez, Mesut zil Oxlade-Chamberlain players poised enter final year contracts others, Hctor Bellern, receptive moves away. Snchez prime target Chelsea. Against all, Wenger endures. He denies chucking medals bin time trinkets sentimentality. You come house surprised, said. I medals, trophies, nothing. You guess I football manager, apart fact game on. I medals out. There guy club I him. Wenger describes himself person not back-looker, forward. At long last, future set clearer. There moments season suggest Leeds Warrington different paths  conclusive all. A year ago, Leeds toiling wrong end Super League Warrington pressed ahead major honours, finishing League Leaders' Shield appearances major finals. There way Leeds reach milestones, annus horribilis 2016 slowly cast everyone minds Rhinos. This year like Leeds old  fitting biggest Super League victory Warrington, old guard stole show. The captain, Danny McGuire, magnificent ably supported fellow veterans Rob Burrow Jamie Jones-Buchanan, scored tries comprehensive victory. But nod future Leeds team  Matt Parcell looks fine acquisition arriving NRL, example. It clinical game went on, better got, said Leeds coach Brian McDermott, moved following Hull defeat Leigh.

Any suggestion Warrington fightback quelled Parcell second shortly break, there, Leeds began cut loose. There tries  including completed Parcell hat-trick late on. B ut Burrow broke score Leeds' seventh final try, Stefan Ratchford lay crestfallen floor. It moment succinctly summed just far apart teams regular season rolls on.

The brilliant youth; effortless, vertiginous rise; prosaic, enraging restrictions; exile fall. And  well, depends hero. Icarus fell straight sea, Danny Cipriani came again. As prepares step Twickenham Wasps' tilt Premiership title final days Lawrence Dallaglio era 2008, better ever, measured, tune him, fly-half. I probably understand game lot better now, says. I feel like I got better brain fly-half. The truth is, burst Dallaglio great Wasps teenager, fly-half wandering maverick, player portfolio. It misfortune, perhaps, begin rise just Wasps' dynasty enter decline, sparkled concession unorthodox. In season, culminated second Heineken Cup win generation, 2007, No10 shirt long-held property Alex King, consummate fly-halfs, Cipriani played season brilliant counterattacking full-back. But assumed King shirt latter departure following season, continued burnish reputation brilliance outside channels. Wasps' policy withdraw frontline defending, turnover ball whipped wide exploit disjointed opponents acceleration superior best wingers. When Wasps won titles, 2008, voted players' player season. He won man match England debut too. He 20 years old. I just thought year going like that. But it long time then. He play Premiership final year horrific ankle injury suffered semi-final. And trouble began. Wasps' form fell away team broke up; angered team-mates reluctance tackle; infuriated new England coach, Martin Johnson, English rugby personified way Cipriani not. The uncharitable accused thinking himself mortal team-mates. Perhaps fairer assessment rebelling straitjacket culture English rugby, felt blissfully  torturously  unrestrained. So left describes a two-year gap year Melbourne Rebels, befriended, others, Kurtley Beale, team-mate, albeit missing Saturday afternoon final injury. But brilliance remained beset controversy, boy learning. For chose stop Sale mentor Steve Diamond, earthy Cipriani flamboyant. My learning curve really Sale, acknowledges, becoming traditional fly-half learning manipulate defences. He played best rugby career years followed, individual showman, master puppeteer. His defence improved, goalkicking. On form England World Cup squad 2015, dynamic shifted. Owen Farrell George Ford emerged, steeped virtues northern modesty Cipriani embracing late. It England chances passed now, given hope. If happens, happens. If does, I ca really control that. It like they going badly right now. Everyone wants play England, do  that pinnacle game. When club came calling summer, Cipriani resist home. Now armed wisdom lacking time there, himself new breed attack-minded Wasps. If forced himself Wasps team previous decade, reached welcome home. The fit snug. Talent-wise, I say team better, man man, experience [that stand out]. We hopefully going team grow greater team before. If Cipriani by, experience make dazzling Wasps better. The defeat Leinster Champions Cup quarter-final, Cipriani himself suffered rare dip form, qualify significant lesson, recovered finish season table, prolific try-scorers Premiership known. There unusually stable policy all-out attack, preserve inconsistent desperate. They doubt turn Twickenham, led boy flew high fast, settled flock. Watford closing No1 managerial target holding talks Hull City head coach Marco Silva.

This week I watched Chinese Super League do to, taking full, slightly wild 90 minutes champions Guangzhou Evergrande versus year runners-up Jiangsu Suning, recent CSL fixtures shown dribs drabs Sky Sports. There vague point simple recreation. The lure Chinese Super League lurk story, noise off, presented kind gilded career-dustbin ageing star hungry agent feed. Diego Costa Radamel Falcao linked moves summer. Only week Wayne Rooney implored go, reminded still give, like man talked 27th-floor windowledge seven-star tower hotel. But China object confused fascination outside borders. Most commonly comes alarm China sheer scale, furious ambition, captured best sport opening Beijing Olympics, massed ceremonial drummers hammering terrifyingly synchronised rhythms like footsoldiers advancing robot army, batter skull pieces sharp end mass-produced, low-cost circuit board. There way CSL portrayed afar. And yes, footballing product, summit meeting Guangzhou Jiangsu predictably middling. But oddly captivating occasion moment players came running huge red soaking Styx-like running track Tianhe Stadium steaming night surface dripping oozing. The Tianhe itself huge, craning stands packed genuinely excited-looking locals. Albeit teams lined pre-match national anthem reminder really is, expression nationalism political familiarly nihilistic European cash circus. There dear old Ramires lining Jiangsu gaucho Luiz Felipe Scolari swaggering touchline looking he stride accuse having sworn horse. The CSL ghosts-of-Chelsea-past kind place generally, AVB there, Oscar here, tracing bit like having weird dream Chelsea 2008-2013 17 shots rice wine caipirinhas. Early shrill cheers crowd slide tackle overhead kick. Beyond Chinese football intense, game collisions, lunges, bruised toes, barked shins. It two-speed affair. At times Brazilians playing kind mini-game got kicking spaces between. Ten minutes Alan, Red Bull Salzburg, scored opener header corner, sightly cheers. And little stodgy slow, cracks poking through, sense Big Football League exists reason Big Football League Big Football League thing be. Which China trying else. The league does purpose simply commercial exercise. China president, Xi Jinping, announced intention China win World Cup 30 years. The new, possibly game-changing tax buying overseas players speaks this, designed prevent wealthy old-lag effect favour development. For overseas transfer equal sum paid fund designed breed local young players. This chuckled England weird wonderful. In fact, it brilliant idea. Why earth, country green space basic facilities poorly provided, do like that? China, land rising economic  deeply useful ideas designed promote local infrastructure. Back Tianhe Alan got second Guangzhou, nice little flick neat finish cheered wildly stand young fans replica shirts, floppy hair glasses, kind indie-chic terrace look, Chinese champions cheered 40,000 sensitive San Francisco singer-songwriters 1990s. Towards end hell broke loose Colombian Roger Martnez, looks like nice friendly tubby teddy bear, involved shin-raking flare-up pretty present lost mind, players shoving yelling bickering place, referee taking minutes round sending off. Believe Canton, huge pitch-side sign urged this. But really believe Chinese football? Sheffield United Bolton win league now. If scooped best Brazilians CLS you'd probably pretty decent Ukrainian Europa League team. The lack ingrained football culture clubs leagues flagged scornfully fatal flaw ambition.

With Essex table, chirp Chelmsford right now, louder Jamie Porter Matt Quinn, destroyers Hampshire time out, reduced Surrey 31 five. But, like Lancashire, Warwickshire Middlesex them, Essex met Kumar Sangakkara. They undone old new. There 61st first-class century Sangakkara Sam Curran, 21 years junior. Sangakkara days, biggest and, given circumstances, best first-class innings (the man Surrey equal championship record); CB Fry, Mike Procter Don Bradman scored spin. When retires summer end leave big hole Surrey batting lineup game large: cherish him. He reached ton perfect straight drive, 13th 174th ball.

Fortunately plenty longer watching Curran, wait ages make nineties. Surrey picked debutant, offspinner Amar Virdi, Gareth Batty injured toe. He fresh cricinfo unaware birthdate (18 July 1998, make feel ancient), he month older Curran. Curran watchful early, hit hand Porter lunch; result, endure leg theory Wagner. Having survived that, cashed in, pulling swatting ground cutting fiercely. Eventually, danced Simon Harmer missed. James Foster, side, rest. The stand worth 191, mighty effort Surrey start. Quinn left-handers, Mark Stoneman edging second slip, captain Rory Burns brilliantly taken gully, Scott Borthwick caught behind, Porter dealt righties: Dom Sibley bowled beauty Ben Foakes played pulling.

But bone growth right knee blighted preparations 2015 world championships, groin problem Olympics, felt choice. My coaches completely stripped things down.

Come Arsne, it! One. Last. Hush. For months months Wenger unyielding face simple requests clarity, staring drooling, yellow-toothed maw national media remaining steadfastly unhelpful. Younger weaker managers cracked just moment breathing space away sweaty interrogators, defeat trumpeted yellow ticker shame. Not Wenger.

The Fiver asked sources American intelligence services they telling, means do know. All say sure 136th FA Cup final memorable multitude possible reasons.

Manu Garca runs finger carefully long list names, squinting slightly searches own. Sixteen years on, knows look 13,200 written tiny white print blue yellow background, covering millimetre left right, easy find. Eventually, sees father, hidden hundreds Garcas. And then, line below, stops. Here, says. This me. MANUEL ALEJANDRO GARCA. When Deportivo Alavs reached stages Uefa Cup 2001, paid homage socios [members] listing kit, literally fabric club. Which night played final, Liverpool Dortmund, Manu Garca shirt, two-thirds way down. On Saturday, play second final, Barcelona Madrid, back. It stitched captain armband, too. Now 31, Garca born Vitoria 1986. While kids wanted Romario Laudrup, I wanted Manolo Serrano, says. He Alavs fan dad socio too. He is: seat sits talks seat, he barely years  instead. I remember games, moments, flashes, details, says softly, pointing corners ground. Across pitch general stood kid. No stands Mendizorroza now; looks different days, memories remain. Sitting here, I things like fan perspective lose you there, says. I 8-5 Real Unin, penalty end, standing, celebrating goals hanging fence. I myself time asking dad permission climb  Permission? I good boy, good son, Garca smiles. When Alavs promoted division Rayo Vallecano [in 1998], I remember standing cousin looking dad, saying OK'. I climbed went pitch players. For me, it moments like those, Serrano goal knocking Madrid cup, dad remembers everything. Alavs had primera 42 years day I remember saying: I did think we'd again; I did think I'd it.' He seen back, he seen Uefa Cup final, he seen son play division Alavs. Now, Alejandro Garca watch son lead Copa del Rey final, too. I feel lucky live club experienced before. My dad I talk lot, quite emotional, Garca says. I feel emotional now, just thinking it. We know lies it: work, sacrifice, effort. His effort. My mum, sisters', mine. What we through, bad moments, Garca continues, puffing cheeks. It dream, really. Only dreamed this. Very people chance experience like this; think it possible. When you kid, innocence kids have, maybe think you play home-town team. I remember local players like Sivori, Pablo, Salcedo: I wanted like them. You think play Alavs ca you? But realistically do think it possible, you inside football hard is, unlikely circumstances right. You just do it. And that thing. This just local boy makes cup final team; making all. Him them. Although Real Sociedad spotted 14, August Garca played La Liga before. The midfielder had played second tier 2013. For years, played second division B level, Real Sociedad B team, Real Unin, Eibar Logros. Garca finally got chance play Alavs  came risen level, dropped his. Miraculous Uefa Cup finalists 2001, Alavs relegated 2003, returned 2004 and, owned infamous Dimitry Piterman, relegated 2006. Piterman disappeared, leaving club economic crisis verge going business, relegation following 2009. With Alavs administration, 2011 owners Baskonia basketball club persuaded embark rescue mission. The following summer, Garca got call. I parents called say interested. I knew I'd play Alavs: way would reach agreement. I'd hard time meant coming home, joining team I socio. I went close friends, struggled too, year pure ilusin [hope, optimism, enthusiasm]. It home, club, people. I training session, coming door there, says, pointing. I remember laps round pitch, seeing stands, drills. I photos. I socio, I played elsewhere. I remember play-off Lugo second division. I desperate win [but] had, I'd played here. My history changed completely. If Alavs division, second, thought me. So came amateurs, did stop there. In season, Alavs promoted second division; following year, survived final day thanks 94th minute goal Jan, relegation Segunda B catastrophic; fourth, won title, returning flight decade away. Garca scored goal effectively secured it, got primera  94th minute Atltico Caldern. On Saturday, return Copa del Rey final, stadium match. This huge Alavs, historic. The memory game Liverpool Dortmund underlines just big. In groundsman office corner, lawnmowers kept, wall decorated massive mural ticket match 2001. Garca go; playing Real Sociedad B. I came Vitoria watch dad, says. Vitoria deserted. It day like today: hot, sunny. It was: suffer, enjoy, suffer, enjoy  end crying. We sad time felt pride  that there. Sixteen years on, they final. Garca did expect this, expect Alavs primera; anticipated them. No, that, admits. No, no. Not that. But club? I knew club make it: everything. A strong group running club, working well: signed good players, good coaches. And all, fan base abandon them. It six, seven years Alavs went very, bad times fans had taken step forward spoken up, local authorities abandoned club, left die. It folded. The fans did let happen. I sure Alavs return division, happen quickly. And I thought I'd year, maybe two. One season, let see.' And it seasons like that. Garca left 2012. Does make sad? Yes, says. Because  For moment, ca words. Look starts. He blows cheeks. There people went much, effort club, dedicated, live moment huge pity. I think people won promotion, especially Jan fighting survival: people like Borja Viguera, Luismi, Jago Beobide, Ion Vlez, Iaki Goitia. People have able stay enjoy moment like I am. I think lot saddens me. I present, talk publicly. I know they enjoying they it: them, Alavs would today. It different now, players different. Garca car stands parked corner stadium, precisely does stand out, feels like case apart. It players different surroundings are, says: life makes you, life takes you. Asked average player earns Segunda B, says poco  There long pause. It would reach 2,000 month. [Less 21,000 year]. A long way figures we talking now, wow! It like it. But demands minds. We professional, entirely dedicated. That has changed; changes us. We lucky. It just salaries, it everything. The pitch good condition. There people us. There assistants, fitness coaches, physios, recovery staff. Before, physio, it three. We travel plane, bus then. The hotels changed. Everything goes division magnificent players appreciate that. I 10-hour journeys bus, stopping twice, arriving middle night defeat. Now, hours, we home. It comfortable. Until step pitch, is. You new team-mates join: they faster, impressive physically, better technically. Every single team-mates brilliant something. They complete, too. Before, maybe team-mates   things weak others. Or you decent everything. Now, bit they brilliant something. And play Barcelona, Madrid, Atltico  pfff  they level. You make huge effort compete them. So you? After all, Alavs drew Atltico won Camp Nou, finishing ninth, fourth highest finish history. How beat Barcelona? To match them, smarter, cleverer, understand game requires moment. This team game that gives chance. If individual, they better footballers. But team game, think: need? What I help team-mate? How make work? You thinking second. How I make difficult opponents, help team-mate advantage? How create opportunity? That weapon. We great team. The way play is intuitive; it worked on. We clear movements, mechanism built consciously. The way shift across, long way, way lines close together, small distance players. All teams defend similar ways there attacking phase people think it inspiration creativity. It not. If look high up, camera, wide angle, we positioned, defined roles are. The duty player clear; qualities disposal team. No egos, solidarity. Still, it hard. Even little guys tough. At Bernabu, Garca admits surprise Real Madrid player barely flinched clattered him. You good press, work  says admiringly. That they world best: everything. I impressed [Luka] Modric. I suffered him. Isco, too. Suffer word. Asked enjoys it, Garca pulls face. Not much. Not me. Those games demand you, effort concentration, it hard enjoy it. Sometimes you playing, think ca. You enjoy fan. Maybe end, do. So it? Because like feeling afterwards, says, adding: And well, sometimes. The nerves, doubts. Will I play well? Am I ready? There making demands yourself, knowing really push yourself. And works, reward  If reward Saturday, especially. It unique moment, sensations new. I think I know I feel win, Garca says. The way I felt won promotion, times; way I felt survived; way I felt Celta [in semi-final]. You feel plenitude, fulfilled, complete. Nothing hurts, you happy, you people happy. That feeling I lucky experienced times here, share. They there: dad, friends, team-mates, family, girlfriend, people I love. If win, we celebrate together. We history playing second final; win, we touch heaven. If win, we Alavs champions, club. And it club 96-year history. It club; says shirt. There saying sounds like ancient bit received wisdom probably originates justly maligned Tom Cruise vehicle Cocktail goes everything ends badly, would end. Like clichs meaningful do think hard, does really apply real life works wonders talking sports. In sports, team player guaranteed happy ending, participant quest ends ends loss, usually painful effectively invalidates successes brought point. There exceptions though. Consider 2016-17 Boston Celtics, season ended Thursday 135-102 home loss Cleveland Cavaliers Game 5 Eastern Conference finals. The Celtics held lead game, opening minutes, 20 points early quarter. Before half-time increasingly obvious game season. By objective measure, depressing, dispiriting end fans home team. Yet did feel way TD Garden, feeling appreciative wake funeral. For part, fans, ones loyal navely optimistic remain arena game, keenly aware fact Celtics gone far talent them. Less seasons ago, traded point guard Rajon Rondo, remaining starter 2008 championship team, Dallas Mavericks. The team, new head coach Brad Stevens, clearly signalling beginning long-term rebuilding process. They supposed good soon. The Celtics went run immediately trading undersized guard Isaiah Thomas 2015, leading completely unexpected playoff appearance just months apparently punting season. The year finished fifth place Eastern Conference managed sign free agent Al Horford offseason. They supposed better year, delusional optimists expected seize No1 seed Eastern Conference making significant deadline (thanks assist Cavaliers' mounting indifference regular season). After getting past round postseason appearances, Celtics round NBA finals. Yes, Cavaliers quick work them, seriously thought chance defending champs. Heck, managed steal game Cleveland, road less, opponents managed do. Now, maybe Boston bit competitive series. Whenever team falls short title, play th what if game: What Celtics hung 16-point lead Game 4 ended tying series two-all. What Thomas came series fully healthy severely hampered hip injury eventually forced sit games season? However, reasonable fans realized, series began, series miracles and/or unfortunate injuries guys particular Celtics team beat Cavaliers make championship round. I like think fans chanted Let Celtics, growing tradition Garden fans sense end near, gave team standing ovation final futile minutes blowout loss, represented majority fanbase understood particular Celtics team went far possibly go, farther thought would. The downside Celtics' successful season expectations going much, higher out. The Celtics longer rebuilding. They clinched best record East, conference finals and, thanks Brooklyn Nets, pick upcoming NBA draft. The Celtics fairly young team respected coaches game. Should lose games Cavaliers, Eastern Conference team season, it going play feel-good story. Nor it. The Celtics are, fact, face biggest challenge Brad Stevens era. They crossroads, general manager Danny Ainge company decide step be. Do try team legitimately threaten LeBron James current seven-year streak reaching finals? Do play conservatively focus acquiring potentially talented younger players established All-Stars cost taking step season possibly beyond? Staying wo option either, right course action. The harsh economic realities NBA, potential positional overlap, soon make impossible core team together. Key players Avery Bradley Jae Crowder, maybe current team MVP Thomas, suiting teams near future, depending Celtics afford players bring draft free agency. That maybe bittersweet Let Celtics chants, represented chance fans appreciation particular group players, superstar them, meant win championship absolutely won respect. Antonio Conte ready sign contract extension Chelsea establish highest-paid manager club history seeks secure Premier League FA Cup Double victory Arsenal Wembley. Chelsea expected offer Italian deal worth 9.6m year 2021, years current contract expiry, wake hugely impressive year English football. Conte anticipates returning briefly Italy break FA Cup final club end-of-season awards night Battersea Sunday, soon London continue planning season. Confirmation new deal follow. My situation clear: I years' contract club, said Conte. Then, club possibility stay extend contract, sure I available this. We idea future we started work season.

The 46-year-old focus present achieving Chelsea second Double  emulating achievement Carlo Ancelotti year club 2009-10  victory Wembley admitted team progress season surprised him, particularly badly beaten Arsenal 24 September. That 3-0 defeat prompted Roman Abramovich spend days Cobham observing training. The owner presence might, past, signalled worst manager. But watched sessions, saw video analysis stayed us, supporting me, said Conte, expected prefer Nemanja Matic Cesc Fbregas Chelsea midfield Saturday. He showed angry. I think club saw job, pre-season period, trusted me. I thought club thinking sacking me. Honestly. But difficult think we'd arrive end season celebrating winning league then. Not impossible difficult. In period lot big problems solve right solution quickly easy. In fact, start season, you'd said qualify Champions League, I'd signed that. But I great players, players implement ideas changes, able change season. Chelsea recovery defeat Emirates extended 13-game winning streak, title claimed seven points Tottenham Hotspur. The champions' motivation Wembley extends setting early tone season. All players ready season I think Saturday good opportunity pressure Arsenal rivals also, said Eden Hazard. If win, it good prepare season. I hope start something. We new manager, couple young players, ready build. The 10 years Chelsea great. The team won lot trophies it like new generation. Frank Lampard finished, Didier Drogba finished, Ashley Cole, John Terry. All gone. So it new generation want prove club best world. We ready that.

Though officially private visit Europe, US president risks upstaging Donald Trump, awkward impression Nato leaders Brussels Thursday visibly chilly meeting pope Rome. By contrast, Obama warmly received German chancellor, Angela Merkel, earlier visit Berlin Thursday landed Scotland Friday amid sort excitement normally reserved current world leaders. The truncated four-car motorcade picked casually-dressed president private airport outside Edinburgh served rare reminder that, despite tight security, longer serving head state. Obama office insist long-scheduled trip strictly private affair timing coincidental Trump overseas visit open media. Nonetheless, camera phones present witness famously golf-obsessed president complete homage St Andrews tee round applause. Before teed president caddy reassured no pressure, sir.

Whoever coined phrase demographics destiny referring Major League Soccer Texas just easily talking politics. Simple population figures imply league biggest clubs facing Texas Derby Sunday, right cannon awarded team season best head-to-head record - provided secured appropriate paperwork safety-conscious city authorities, is. More seven million people live Dallas metropolitan area, fourth-largest nation. Houston fifth, nearly seven million. Yet FC Dallas least-watched teams MLS Houston crowds slide. Going weekend, rivals sat second Western Conference standings, Dynamo owning best home record MLS: played seven, won six, drawn one. Under new head coach, Wilmer Cabrera, Houston offer direct, fast-paced style liable score  concede  often. The Mexican forward designated player, Erick Cubo Torres, goals, making league second-highest scorer far season. The average crowd, though, 17,653: modest figure, especially given MLS habit declaring tickets distributed actual attendance. After boost moved crumbling university football venue smart downtown soccer-specific home 2012, Houston average crowd roughly left, teams overtaken them. In season Robertson Stadium ranked ninth attendance; season BBVA Compass Stadium, fourth; season, fourteenth; currently, fifteenth 22 teams. The capacity Dallas' Toyota Stadium limited 16,000 year construction, 2015 drew average 15,981 fans  third-worst MLS. And year, just 2016, Dallas best regular-season record MLS. So going on? Like Chicago Fire, beat 2-1 Thursday 12,584, Oscar Pareja helped location stadium. It distant suburb Frisco, 29 miles downtown journey hour traffic heavy. Houston home appears ideally located entice supporters corners city, Dynamo reached playoffs 2013. Houston fairweather fan mentality comes [the city] local sports teams, said James Hromadka Texian Army fan group. He attended Dynamo road game Dallas Toyota Stadium Sunday. When winning team, people up. Manny Gutierrez, leaders group, El Battalon, said sense ownership resting laurels previous years discouraging lack effort field, matters improving.

Still, smaller places  Salt Lake City, Portland, Kansas City Vancouver, handful  attract MLS fans, Texas status major sporting hub dispute crowds international overseas club fixtures impressive, Manchester United set face Manchester City Houston 20 July, days north Texas hosts Concacaf Gold Cup semi-final. Not away Portland aside [NBA] Blazers there really lot else. There team that got decades history precede MLS, Gutierrez said. Houston gets absolutely saturated Latin American clubs come here. These teams fathers, teams countries people live city, come from. And there loyalty brand, loyalty club grew with. We surrounded lot clubs fans look outsiders, new guy, kind thrown market lot established fan groups. The Dynamo started play 2006 then-owners AEG relocated San Jose Earthquakes Houston won MLS Cup seasons. We came weird transitionary period league [four years] contracting couple teams [in Florida], moving team lot history market could team around, Gutierrez said.

We able look metrics they moving right direction. All indicators moving right direction, teams league moving bit faster. But time start winning championships legacy success field hopefully translate success field. Houston lost 4-1 Atlanta United week nearly 45,000 fans Georgia z- newcomers moved new stadium yet.

West Ham signed Manchester City defender Pablo Zabaleta. The Argentina full-back join London club two-year deal 1 July, contract City expires having released Etihad Stadium. This absolute pleasure West Ham, Zabaleta told West Ham TV. I hope I good moments. Of course, I come club enjoy myself hopefully successful time. Zabaleta 200 appearances City following Espanyol 2008. During time club, full-back won Premier League twice, 2011 FA Cup League Cups. Zabaleta revealed turned offers Italy, Spain England sign Hammers. The 32-year-old confident continue deliver following London Stadium. Sometimes new challenge need person player.

And, course, probably right time on. Also, player, I thought I wanted playing Premier League. For me, country long, new challenge Premier League I ready looking forward it. Zabaleta major summer signing Slaven Bilic, determined improve squad season east London club look build mid-table finish. West Ham confirmed Thursday departures Alvaro Arbeloa, Jonathan Calleri Gokhan Tore. Another chapter story AFC Wimbledon remarkable rise leagues written May, went Wembley secured sixth promotion 13 seasons. The club played competitive match 2002  tenth-tier Combined Counties League  competing place League One, meet nemeses, MK Dons. Their 2-0 victory Plymouth Argyle final fully deserved, Lyle Taylor accomplished finish setting way Ade Akinfenwa delivered perfect swansong AFC Wimbledon career penalty 100th minute. That match played 57,956 fans  bigger crowd watched League One final previous day  shows just people invested AFC Wimbledon triumph. AFC Wimbledon visit Wembley better timed. It fell anniversary day club founded Wimbledon FC fans 28 May 2002. Neal Ardley, spent majority playing career club managing 2012, secured place play-offs match spare, gave time prepare games define season. Ardley determined make small advantage ensure players ready semi-final Accrington Stanley. By making sure secured play-offs place game remaining, allowed freshen squad point just starting feel pinch heavy schedule like seven games month. Accrington hard game close securing automatic promotion. Then sudden mental torture making Bristol Rovers' last-minute goal play us, flogging team break. So physical edge mental one. AFC Wimbledon home leg semi-final, won 1-0 thanks 94th-minute goal Tom Beere. They delivered psychological blow Accrington Stanley. Before second leg, Ardley told players worry fell superior fitness count. Sure enough, Dons 2-0 hour facing elimination. But buckle. Akinfenwa goal aggregate score 2-2 Taylor goal extra-time secured place Wembley. Even surreal disruption caused floodlights failure Wham Stadium derail progress. The meticulous approach helped reach final paid dividends met Plymouth Wembley. We actually planned month advance, says Ardley. If make semis, going do; make final, going do. We sat discussed comes final, things outside game itself getting tickets, players buy, cost, family friends sitting. The club decided make arrangements allow players focus task ahead. It small Ardley eyes, crucial one. The issue cope period semi-final final, players fortnight game, experienced season. That like eternity, says Ardley. So asked make time fly by? We actually trained squad days let players fitness local gyms heart rate monitors. We visited Wembley, went stadium tour, went pitch, looked families sitting, seeing dressing rooms, lounge afterwards. The match preparation held Saturday Sunday game time focused specifically going play. On morning final I convinced going win game. You just players' eyes. It was just bravado. There way going lose. We decided stay true ourselves, players tracksuits  season  players tight-fitted suits specially made. They pitch taking selfies that. One players said got trying had. Again fine margins working AFC Wimbledon favour, small Ardley preparations slightly awry undermined chances victory. We booked family holiday Dubai night game. It 10.15pm flight Heathrow so, game gone extra time, bit tight. The club car arranged Wembley Way cases ready go. In 75th minute score 0-0, I turned called Neil Cox Simon Bassey [his assistant coaches] I told I thinking going upfront.' They looked said: Really? I said: Look, I got plane catch ca afford extra time.' They just laughed time brought Akinfenwa on. Within minute substitution Taylor scored and, inevitably, Akinfenwa wrapped victory goal deep injury time. After precise planning advance close attention finest detail, ways reassuring thought missing flight just finally swung balance. Richard updated book play-offs, The Agony Ecstasy, Antonio Conte verge winning Double season England. That sounds remarkable feat actually Chelsea disposed Manchester United, Tottenham Arsenal FA Cup running round Wembley trophy Saturday evening, little doubt Double somewhat devalued currency days. With decline FA Cup  weakened teams, seats, 5.30pm kick-offs Wembley, know sort thing  used rare impossibly exalted honour suffered parallel status slip commonplace. Manchester United managed times 90s. Arsenal twice Arsne Wenger. Even Chelsea managed before, Carlo Ancelotti won Cup league 2010 lasted season getting sack. The Champions League leading clubs now, Roman Abramovich tepid decade considered historic club achievement. There gasps Kenny Dalglish won Double Liverpool player-manager 1986, scoring goal final day league season Chelsea beating Everton 3-1 final week later. Everyone thought landmark moment, was, point Double achieved twice 20th century. Preston North End Aston Villa recorded Doubles end 19th century, long wait Bill Nicholson Tottenham achieved beginning regarded impossible 1961. Those glory days Spurs, supporters alarmed know waiting league title half century later, probably true say dreams coming true years little easier bear. Arsenal Double winners 1971, commentator underwhelmed considered unremarkable team likened achievement climbing Everest brogues. In words, thought unworthy team diminished feat. Never mind Bertie Mee really ordinary  people thought Charlie George goal celebration extra time Wembley fairly memorable, members team getting little long tooth  just concentrate Everest connection. That Double perceived 50 years ago. A distant daunting peak, place aspire visit. No wonder remarkable Dalglish, 34-year-old season management, conquered afresh 15 years later. No knew space single decade, turn century, Manchester United Arsenal manage times them. There things happening point: Premier League running Champions League rejigged format best teams country enter year. Both developments effect making teams stronger richer. Where source pride country seven years different champions season  happened twice 60s 70s  gradually number possible champions declined smaller clubs squeezed picture. In 12 years Premier League different teams won title, singular Blackburn success prevented Manchester United recording row. Even now, teams champions 25 years Premier League, statistic look worse Blackburn intervention Leicester heroics year. With stratification league came notion semi-permanent four, long FA Cup rarely left possession teams. Apart Everton 1995, Portsmouth 2008 Wigan 2013, past 25 years seen unlikely victors, drama, just steady succession winners began termed Champions League elite. The FA Cup monopolised biggest, wealthiest clubs way Premier League did, obvious result single club winning main domestic honours season longer stretch. Liverpool borrowed time 1986. Another couple titles come Dalglish way run success stopped English clubs competing Europe time, natural Double height achieved. By time Heysel ban lifted European Cup obviously major prize, took Manchester United adapt, 1999 Treble earned kudos felt right FA Cup swerve following season, shamefully persuaded FA support doomed World Cup bid instead. Was moment Double lost remained lustre? It been, process probably inevitable anyway. What certain Chelsea win Cup 12th English Double. The spread thinly 100 years; seven compressed 25 years Premier League era. This way modern football, vast wealth game creating superclub effect shared evenly. Should Juventus prevail Saturday Champions League final complete Italian treble, second country history  mere seven years Internazionale won first. Whereas trebles unheard Europe, Celtic set ball rolling 50 years ago, recorded accomplished 10 years, possibility coming Cardiff. Supermoney breeds superclubs supercoaches  Manchester City won season manager won treble  possibility concentration game major prizes narrowing band rich powerful clubs continue. It glory used know it, bulldozers got Danny Blanchflower famous old quote, game supposed about, used run White Hart Lane stands. Spurs perfectly entitled new ground wish but, like bragging modern team win Double, simply exercise nostalgia. The yips form. Usually think phenomenon terms individual submitting technical meltdown: golfer seizing sight six-inch putt, tennis player suddenly incapable tossing ball serve accurately, bowler losing ability land ball near cut strip. Jon Lester stranger variations. A recent issue Sports Illustrated carried long absorbing feature 33-year-old left-handed pitcher Chicago Cubs, mysteriously lost ability years ago throw ball base. Facing batter, effective ever. Turn 90 degrees left, like man trying target blindfolded. Naturally tried cure problem, attempting source biometrics psychology moved Boston Red Sox Oakland As Chicago. Nothing difference. So chose work it, developing feints signs opponents taking advantage specific weakness. His coaches came accept occasional stolen base price pitching remained useful Lester given $155m six-year contract Cubs play hoodoo-ending World Series win year. What makes yips alarming attack mounts function probably questioned before. The fundamental joy sport satisfaction making want go, it tiny little golf ball 200mph racing car. That begins childhood, application motor functions. As expertise grows, simplest pleasures evolve naturally enriching engagement competitive sport. It remains continually measure ourselves, trivial way kicking pebble gutter tossing crumpled envelope wastepaper basket. Getting yips horrifying experience. When happened me, I playing cricket happily 30 years. On pleasant afternoon lovely ground Oxford I'd taken wickets seven overs fast-medium pace delivery new suddenly, apparent reason, went vertical. The hit toecap. And that continued, mercifully ended excruciating number no-balls. Every element natural coordination vanished. It did come weekend solitary hours nets spent attempting right. I did try psychotherapy. Instead I gave game turned reliable source self-validation generator mental distress. The key moment ball left hand: release fingertips. The intense efforts sort out, intervened override combination physical mental judgment possible direct ball accurately. It subliminal flash white light obliterated parameters instinctively consulted processed moment delivery. Maybe that Lester experiences attempts throw base. The eminent philosopher sports fan David Papineau, teaches King College London New York City University, writes interestingly yips new book Knowing Score, subtitled How Sport Teaches Us About Philosophy (And Philosophy About Sport). The yips, writes, are sporting equivalent cancer cured placed remission. According analysis, efforts nets worse wasted. No good come self-consciousness technique. By turning mind components skills, reduce level beginner trying play numbers. You end desperately stitching movements, exercising smooth skills hours practice instilled you. The yips, continues, afflict actions triggered players themselves. That includes taking penalty kick, saw weekend, England record failure shoot-outs international tournaments extended encompass team lost final European Under-17 Championship. They twice taken lead 2-1 stoppage time Spain equalised sixth minute stoppage time. Using interesting new Uefa aimed equalising psychological pressure, team takes penalty takes row, England Aidan Barlow converted opening kick, followed successes Spain. Then Rhian Brewster Joel Latibeaudiere missed England, hitting post firing bar respectively, leaving opponents seal 4-1 success impeccable efforts. It hard avoid conclusion Brewster Latibeaudiere undermined personal technical failings significance night underlying awareness dismaying tradition going 10 years born, nightmare Chris Waddle Stuart Pearce Turin, featuring Gareth Southgate, Paul Ince, David Batty, David Beckham, Darius Vassell, Frank Lampard, Steven Gerrard, Jamie Carragher, Ashleys Young Cole.

Arsenal fans riled Groundhog Day repetitions past years treated immediate Saturday FA Cup final Chelsea. Faced prospect tangle Diego Costa, Arsenal centre-backs cutting straight chase. Shkodran Mustafi concussed. Laurent Koscielny sent banned. Gabriel got early injured knee. Entering Diego Zone? They way ahead you. Arsenal generally seen best worst Costa seasons mischief fury Premier League, centre-forward does play edge appear times completely unaware edge exists place. Even strength, successive Wenger-issue centre-halves bruised bullied head-to-head record kidney-punching defeats single, ultimately fruitless, victory September, 3-0 win Emirates acted spark Chelsea title charge. Even Costa does score tended dominate occasions. As memorably reeling Gabriel Stamford Bridge season, Arsenal Brazilian sent retaliating provocation left wandering tears, gulping air, like prize trout hooked, landed ready misery harbour wall. Most recently Costa involved Chelsea goals 3-1 win Stamford Bridge February, kind scare-assist, Costa ran Petr Cech hope expectation. Spooked, Cech panicked scuffed ball straight Cesc Fbregas. Chuck chance turn bravura farewell Chelsea chief goal-sicario, hard fear slightly makeshift Arsenal backline. Per Mertesacker starts league traumatised Costa Emirates year half ago. Mertesacker himself wheeled start heart four-man defence. Alongside promising Rob Holding come game unharmed ogre Stamford Bridge. Holding fine keeping similarly powerful Romelu Lukaku quiet weekend. Costa, though, challenge unlike other, brutally effective, emotionally physically bruising forward player past seasons. For longer though? Talk Tianjin Quanjian summer eased little past week, Chinese club making pursed pointed comments asked pay premium prices European agents (China, meet Jorge. Jorge, China). Costa little restless while. He high-mileage battering ram days, twanging hamstrings wrenched league title races hard seasons Spain England. Costa rise Brazil small-town interior improbable qualities. It hard tempted chance enrich himself new frontier. One thing certain. If Wembley really end Costa league titles, 57 goals, 400 fouls relentlessly shrill concatenation outrage, chosen better opponent. For Arsenal Costa just menace. He got away, failure recruitment galling fact player league embodies better mannered, orderly late-Wenger team needed. Arsenal tried sign Costa summer 2013. A 30m-plus buyout clause off. Yaya Sanogo arrived instead. Nicklas Bendtner retained year. More recently Costa price tag spent Danny Welbeck Lucas Prez combined, arguably definition false economy. There fair chance Arsenal won league past years Costa come Emirates, bringing team palpably lacked, little raggedness, little horrible, needling street-warrior spirit. And just either. One reason Chelsea want hang Costa difficulty replacing all-round game. For theatricality Costa wonderful footballer. His movement exceptional, sniffing kind goalscoring spaces set Fbregas radar twitching ability sprint long distances, carry ball, hound defenders generally pull team forward wake. A feature Chelsea Costa years spectacle lone centre-forward scrabbling surrounded ball feet, scoring exactly kind breakaway goal turned 3-1 win Manchester City December, Costa produced arguably outstanding individual attacking performance domestic season. He gladiator moments relentless contributor cause. No centre-forward near dribbles. No player top-six club crosses shots near clearances, laid assists Costa seven playing centre-forward. Plus strange dark energy distinguishes Costa mannered opponents Wembley average home-reared Premier League player. This man formally coached 16, learned play scrubland, worked uncle shop late teens, nicknamed that fucking Brazilian pranks, high spirits all-round ragged behaviour young man Albacete. Plenty rough edges comfort zone here. Albeit, plenty undesirable too. Diego likes cheat lot, Kurt Zouma said TV defeat Arsenal Stamford Bridge year, statement Zouma later clarified club channels pointing really meant say was: Diego player puts pressure opponents. You say again, Kurt. Costa horrible, seeking tender spot, play-acting, niggling crossing line gracelessness. At times distract team. At controlled. It Costa led Chelsea 2-2 draw Tottenham summer decided title match marked Mark Clattenburg booking 12 players not, incredibly, Costa, unseen hand cards. As Chelsea master unease prepares valedictory Wembley final value clear enough, player presence surely improved team league past years.

We situation favourable David Gea club maybe wants [to], Louis van Gaal, manager, said time. De Gea sentiment changed prove difficult Mourinho hold him. In nutshell, United finished sixth Premier League, 24 points Chelsea scored 54 times 85 Antonio Conte champions. The tally Van Gaal managed 12 months ago. This partly function Mourinho defence-first approach lack regular goalscorer support Ibrahimovic, struck 28 knee injury. As Wayne Rooney says: The manager makes hard beat hopes we goal win game.

I feel we progressing team club, I sure there more. The end Premier League 25th campaign provides opportune moment marvel division tremendous tactical technical development quarter century. At inaugural season 1992-93 Premier League largely based 4-4-2, long balls getting mixer; 25 years 3-4-2-1, intricate combination play gegenpressing. The significant progress occurred mid-1990s. There various contributing factors: backpass law meant teams obliged comfortable possession, huge surge broadcasting revenue meant English football attract players end three-foreigner rule inevitably changed teams' approach significantly. On weekend, August 1992, 11 non-British Irish players started Premier League 22 clubs combined. By end decade foreign managers dominant Chelsea fielded all-foreign starting XI. English football, traditionally slow embrace tactical innovations abroad, opened eyes. It period remarkable change tremendous excitement. One Premier League fascinating players period Georgi Kinkladze, absurdly talented Georgian No10 provided incredible moments magic joining Manchester City 1995. Kinkladze unlike City supporters witnessed before, marvellously evasive dribbler eye through-ball odd wonder goal. But Kinkladze completely unsuited traditional English 4-4-2 and, order incorporate favoured position, City managers forced tactical experiments proved disastrous eventually contributed club suffering consecutive relegations. The story Kinkladze, successful foreign imports, summarised Premier League football period. After transformative presence Eric Cantona established Manchester United Premier League dominant force mid-1990s, rival clubs desperately attempted equivalent. This proved successful  Arsenal finished half season Dennis Bergkamp arrival 1995, Chelsea Gianfranco Zola joined 1996. Both rivalled Cantona impact, helping introduce technical, continental style play. But basing inventive No10 work, Alan Ball Manchester City discovered Kinkladze, epitome frustrating genius. Kinkladze recruited sensational performance Georgia 5-0 thrashing Wales November 1994, seismic result: years Georgia gained independence competitive victory. Deployed Temuri Ketsbaia Shota Arveladze 4312 formation, Kinkladze ran game grabbed international goal. They murdered us, Wales goalkeeper, Neville Southall, recalled. Kinkladze different class best player pitch mile. In return fixture following summer Kinkladze dominated. This time scored game goal, incredible 25-yard, left-foot chip Southall. The Georgian tracked clubs, having unsuccessful trials Real Atltico Madrid  and, intriguingly, month-long loan Boca Juniors, revere No10 role club world football, Kinkladze met idol, Diego Maradona. None signed Kinkladze permanently, however, instead joined Manchester City Ball signing. The City experience started disastrously. They collected points 11 games, scoring goals, Kinkladze struggled: homesick, unable speak English living Manchester hotel months. His improvement coincided arrival Georgian friends mother, Khatuna, brought home comforts: Georgian cognac, walnuts spices make favourite dishes. Kinkladze scored goal November, late winner 1-0 victory Aston Villa Maine Road. He bewildered start with, Ball said time. He spoke little English foreign tackle scrap fight like England. But boy got immense talent. Kinkladze Premier League spell best remembered couple truly magnificent goals. The opened scoring Middlesbrough December 1995, collected ball right dribbled inside-left position suddenly cutting inside Phil Stamp sidefooting ball firmly far corner. His superb strike, later voted March goal month, came Southampton. Having opened scoring close-range tap-in hit crossbar outside box, Kinkladze collected ball right, dribbled directly goal evading increasingly desperate challenges, dummied Dave Beasant ground, lifted ball head net. It closest thing I seen Maradona goal England, Ball raved, somewhat unnecessarily clarifying: Not hand, away. People ask bringing type player country. If was answer today, is. City supporters tired Manchester United dominance Cantona cult-like status, absolutely worshipped Kinkladze  best Georgi Manchester Best. The feeling reciprocated: initial alienation Manchester Kinkladze grew love city married Mancunian. If he'd playing successful team, said striker Niall Quinn time, then won player player year it quite breathtaking he English football. He lovely guy wellI think, does speak word Englishbut nice. This height Britpop Kinkladze rewarded fine form chant tune Oasis' Wonderwall. All runs Kinky makes blinding, ran, ending brilliant: And  we got Alan Ball. The composer song, City fan Noel Gallagher, offered wonderful Kinkladze summary. Describing either frightening thing I seen best thing I seen, Gallagher predicted Kinkladze lead City European Cup, fourth division. He nearly right: Kinkladze left City 1998 tier. City relegated precisely Ball built entire team Kinkladze. For me, Georgi catalyst City problems, said forward Paul Walsh. Do wrong, Georgi amazing individual ability and, goals YouTube, they'd rival great player planet. But Ball indulged him. He wanted build team Georgi change dynamic side, going workfor player team operated did score goals, did make goals, did tackle, did head overall contribution was enough. The winger Nicky Summerbee agreed. Bally loved him. Georgi wrong  I got were jealous talented was, hated Alan Ball doing  Georgi loved praisethe problem Georgi could play 4-4-2 best would want playing conventional running midfield game and, men wide, leaves midfield. Ball changed formation time, sure sign did know doing. Keith Curle, City captain, later recalled extent free role Ball afforded Kinkladze. I remember losing away Arsenal season goals conceded came Georgi had tracked runner. The lads happy said manager game. In reply told that, talented Georgi, would track either. After City relegation Ball lasted games replaced Frank Clark, tried similar approach. I wanted build team Kinkladze that ideal way best him. He incredible talent [but] certainly did like running did ball feet I thought certain resentment squad. Like Ball, Clark ended changing formation change Kinkladze role. He initially played 4-4-2 Georgian deep-lying forward, switched 4-3-1-2, fielding strike duo. We tied knots trying accommodate him, Clark said. The 4-3-1-2 suited Kinkladze perfectly gave great freedom, did suit players did work. Clark replaced Joe Royle, footballing romantic, words board footballing matters simple: We sell Kinkladze. He longer indulged. Kinkladze team player disturbing habit disappearing long periods games, Royle explained. To supporters positive time. To big negative. The Georgian sold Ajax, club deeply value technical players generally play 4-3-3  meaning manager, Jan Wouters, space No10. I Maradona would changed accommodate me, Kinkladze complained. He returned Premier League showed flashes brilliance spell Derby County, stage managers tired basing him. English football learned appreciate quality provided mysterious, continental No10s, Premier League largely fixated varieties 4-4-2. Therefore, entire definition No10 forward midfielder instead between, realistically No10 considered other. And withdrawn forwards like Cantona, Bergkamp Zola thrived dropping deep turning 4-4-1-1, brilliant attacking midfielders like Kinkladze Middlesbrough Juninho  suffered relegation despite immense talent  caused managers problems generally needed unusual formations English team-mates accustomed to. The Premier League evolved radically terms incorporating technical footballers tactical sense plenty improvement required.

As Manchester United players celebrated Europa League trophy, Jos Mourinho brandished red flag. He walked squad tried plant pitch. The pole, though, flimsy bent, leaving Mourinho prop flag awkwardly hoarding reading Stockholm Final 2017. As metaphor season United hardy bettered: grand gestures thwarted job eventually, just about, done. It night replete symbolism. Deep injury-time Friends Arena Wednesday night, Ajax winger Amin Younes picked ball left. He glanced just jink inside clattered horizontal form Wayne Rooney making effective clunking challenge ball throw-in. That touch United shirt felt hugely appropriate; career pleasing commitment necessary unglamorous work. But said Mourinho United overwhelmed Ajax generally underwhelming final. This expensive football squad assembled, ended Marouane Fellaini playing lone striker. Whether matters depends perspective. In immediate context, probably does. Mourinho celebrations, kissing trophy presented Rooney pretending run players celebrated United fans, suggested just meant him, just essential victory qualifying season Champions League United rebuilding work. Winning critical thing; come later. It not, though, simple that. Mourinho manager occasionally adopts policy pragmatism achieve specific goal, switching expansive. Rather, revels discarding aesthetic expectations, scorning the poets idealistic abstractions win match. This season Mourinho attacked Einsteins opposed him; railing arts sciences, truly man siege. Wednesday win, Mourinho said, a victory pragmatism, victory humble people, victory people respect opponents, victory people try stop opponents exploit weaknesses. In sense, Mourinho masterclass. Ajax thrilled season high pressing fluency play, United thwarted that. As coach, Peter Bosz, said: I did Ajax here. Mourinho has, fury, dismissed veracity certain claims Diego Torres biography him, seven-point plan laid winning big games held true here. United minimised risk, let Ajax ball seized mistakes. High pressing difficult Manchester United played long balls, did risks played second balls, Bosz said. I think boring game. Perhaps neutrals bother Mourinho. There lots poets football, said, but poets do win titles. Avoiding risk strategy; cut supply Kasper Dolberg. The Ajax wingers Younes Bertrand Traor respectively completed 10th dribbles Europa League season. They managed seven Wednesday, end product solitary key pass apiece. They got ball, ran ball option. So isolated Dolberg time touched ball kick Paul Pogba given United 18th-minute lead. The question longer term enough. The suggestion hubristic looking impose style opponents stopping playing characteristic Mourinho propaganda. He understands anti-establishment, underdog shtick employed successfully Porto, Chelsea Internazionale wo really work United, just quickly palled Real Madrid urgent goal toppling Pep Guardiola achieved. You ca richest clubs world, noodle deal territory, pretend reactive football necessary gambit face overwhelming inferiority resources. Similarly, United accept humble approach long necessary. The seasons Sir Alex Ferguson retirement turbulent. If takes club track, it. But is, likely, summer significant expenditure, directors fans soon start expect little poetry enter Mourinho soul United play. 1) Nicky Hayden, MotoGP world champion, tragically died Monday.

They went won 6-0. The best motivational speech season? We definitely think so!  pic.twitter.com/eKotfoCVce Spotters' badges: Oommph, TheCedarRoom, whobroughtoranges Do subscribe, fancy Do subscribe, fancy Every season, Major League Soccer crop breakout players new league  year Atlanta Josef Martnez (the Venezuelan scored goals matches  netting just seven years Turin). The best players come Europe South America immediately key starters. This year, examples domestic players moving US lower divisions succeeding MLS year recent memory. New York Red Bulls center Aaron Long MLS debut March started 13 matches potential MLS Cup contender. Meanwhile, expansion Minnesota United gotten crucial minutes NASL domestic holdovers Christian Ramirez Brent Kallman. Impressively, Ramirez seven goals 12 MLS matches, Golden Boot pace. It raises question: does player like Ramirez slip MLS clubs' scouting? After all, striker 51 goals second-division NASL 2014-2016  American striker league time. For years, MLS perceived issue signing talent US lower divisions  league rise, idea bringing talent overseas like sexier route. But given concerns effects travel, general physicality league, league-wide mission grow academies fostered, signing talent NASL USL gaining importance. One agent, asked remain anonymous, noticed offices wary bringing players on. At center concerns perceived lack quality NASL USL. The lower divisions countries better lower divisions country right now. The [Matteo] Mancosus Bradley Wright-Phillipses needed fresh start wanted try new. You ca compare Mancosu guy NASL. It rare guy level. Amos Magee joined Minnesota office November 2016 club began build inaugural MLS roster. Previously, worked Portland, recommended drafted-and-cut rookie named Miguel Ibarra Minnesota NASL. Ibarra sold 2015 Liga MX Club Len transfer fee $1m. Despite fact Ibarra received USMNT call-ups NASL, MLS club wanted come close figure. Magee told Guardian clubs wary sign second-division players. In past, MLS teams have valued lower-division players point million dollars. Now, lot MLS teams argue wrong. If Ramirez scores goals think can, lot teams spent him, too. For Minnesota, however, abbreviated roster-building timeline presented unique challenges. The club rights desired holdovers NASL side. With Magee newly appointed head coach Adrian Heath coming outsiders, able assess Minnesota talent pool clearer lens. We sorted players thought step forward, I think it turned they important team. Now, do look NASL guys' does. We look players import roster. Matt Cairns (a Hertfordshire-born intermediary represents players MLS NASL USL) represents players MLS sides. To Cairns, remains hesitancy sign players leagues below. I do understand it, Cairns says reluctance. Some NASL clubs ask transfer fees merely $50,000 depending player. Minnesota priced Ramirez highly, was MLS team tested water. Why did team could score goals flier? He final piece puzzle teams creative play. Why would pay $50,000 chance? Along aforementioned Kallman, Cairns' players Nazmi Albadawi, currently scouted Real Salt Lake Sporting Kansas City. As player free agent winter, he face better prospects come MLS. In sense, Ramirez player opens door him. In 2013, MLS USL forged partnership increase development young players country. It gave MLS sides chance affiliates second teams help prospects key minutes. With USL independent league, USL sides MLS affiliates, similar FC Barcelona B competing Spanish Segunda times. One non-affiliated clubs, FC Cincinnati, hottest teams American soccer landscape. They began play spring record-breaking crowds, hosting Crystal Palace summer friendly. FCC midst MLS expansion bid, hoping enter soon 2020. General manager Jeff Berding acknowledges potential berth weighs future decisions. We believe young guys really high upside. By time we'd MLS, future shortly we'd there, knock wood do. Not players, course, prospects. Austin Berry won MLS Rookie Year 2012 signed hometown club Cincinnati 2016. Per Berding, we looking forward bringing home foundational player franchise. He interest, able Cincinnati. Another, Sean Okoli, struggled minutes Seattle Sounders New England Revolution 2016. He ended signing FC Cincinnati, winning Golden Boot, secured flight New York City FC offseason. Unlike Berry, signing Okoli like one-year-plan Berding. It understanding we'd Sean Okoli entire 2016 season. Part agreement gave free transfer window MLS end season. We thrilled Sean Okoli  exactly mind. He scored lot goals helped winning season, got MLS year. It affirmation we trying here. As affiliated sides, there onus winning focus development. The successful versions sides train MLS club backyard, sharing (as previously mentioned Red Bulls II side). For clubs set home-based affiliate, player development stunted. The aforementioned anonymous agent used FC Dallas example. Of FC Dallas homegrowns, you got Kellyn Acosta, Victor Ulloa, Jesse Gonzlez. Of 15 16, they getting minutes development stunted. How failed? Oklahoma actual franchise trying win. That does help Homegrowns going forth hours Dallas Oklahoma. With II sides, players dress team 18 Saturday and, playing, start USL affiliate day. When player loaned club that outside team control, players slip cracks. The agent continued: Everyone play, matter are. They getting minutes. If do, ca develop. You ca tell kid steady run games long time. They need mess mental adversity. It bigger people realize. With different mentalities club club, US lower divisions developing. Each MLS club need make decision: commit affiliation develops players forgo expectations winning trophies, try build best second-division possible, means academy prospects minutes not. Until then, hidden gems lower divisions. Ramirez litmus test and, continues pass, seen American Jamie Vardy. Both players did land top-flight programs right away. Both toiled lower divisions, ultimately landing club highest league country. For Minnesota, hope Ramirez goal tally follows Vardy narrative. The time I tipped Shady McCoy (2.35), 50-1 shot 27-runner race, finishing strongly fourth. Today smaller field, consequent risk weaker pace, he shorter 4-1. Hmmm, going circumstances generally right thing indicate you just following horse cliff. But I strong case again, I'd taking 15-2 briefly available betting began race. He hold-up type I feel tactics overdone Victoria Cup, share place pole. He runs mark here, just 2lb higher finishing strongly score course distance July. He won track previous visit, June 2015. Silvestre Sousa gets ride time, encouraging. I chance likes Horsted Flaming Keynes Castle Harbour, John Gosden reaching cheekpieces. Hugo Palmer favourite later maiden card, good opportunity look alternative bigger price, view yard cloud just now. That overplayed, course, Palmer won maiden just yesterday he unfamiliar 7% strike-rate just now. Button Up (4.55) appeals 6-1. She half-sister Stargazer Stravagante, came good stage three-year-old seasons. Her December debut showed modest promise Sir Michael Stoute filly able big step forward now. Sandown stages best evening card year I myself struggling look past obvious ones. Sound And Silence win National Stakes Big Orange stands Henry II. I spared putting So Mi Dar Brigadier Gerard fact blood picture unpleasing way, she non-runner. I wonder Algometer (7.35) over-priced 12-1 race, David Simcock turned corner placed horses Saturday Lockinge. Algometer ran course distance seasonal return year ago. He horse beat Dartmouth non-Group One contest 2015. Perhaps need juice ground he here. I like Silver Ghost (6.00), favourite opening 10-furlong handicap semi-respectable 5-1. For reason, racked runs Peter Makin Geoffrey Deacon he in-form Eve Johnson Houghton ran debut Lingfield. Returning turf help grey, bit stride him.

Ronald Koeman, worked Dutch defender Southampton considered approach FC Twente player year, wants cover right-back Seamus Coleman long-term injury. Coleman absent season begins recovers double leg fracture. Mason Holgate deputised Republic Ireland captain term Everton Jonjoe Kenny emerging ranks, full-back impressing under-23s Premier League Two title win. But Koeman believes experience needed Martina ability play central defence make appealing option free. It rare final contested teams using utterly different approaches, equally rare game pan predictably. Ajax plenty ball, Manchester United counterattacked proved ruthless penalty area. The stylistic contrast remarkable. Ajax possession-based rejuvenated attack-minded coach, Peter Bosz, man greatly admired Pep Guardiola Barcelona side, transferring template young charges, creating throwback Ajax Total Football days. If Bosz playing role 2010 Guardiola, Jos Mourinho playing role of, well, 2010 Mourinho. The man repeatedly tried frustrate Barcelona resilient deep defending sporadic counterattacking largely here. The early stages slightly different. Ajax started extraordinarily nervily, making defensive errors misplacing simple passes inside half. It doubtful Mourinho actually asked United push press opening stages encouraged Ajax sheer carelessness, forcing repeated spells pressure. The Dutch took 10 minutes settle enjoy spell possession, pattern expected. United went ahead just Ajax growing game. Paul Pogba opener owed fortunate deflection Ajax architects downfall. Left-back Jaro Riedewald, Ajax players started brightly, misplaced throw-in, United won ball quickly eventually, Pogba pounced. Ajax played way danger, looked inevitable opening stages. United approach possession simple. Juan Mata Henrikh Mkhitaryan dropped tracked Ajax full-backs, role accustomed recent weeks, United central midfielders effectively man-marked midfield. Marouane Fellaini played trio prevented passes Lasse Schne, Pogba left shut Davy Klaassen, Ander Herrera played right-of-centre midfield role checking position Hakim Ziyech. It type approach United deployed regularly years, including Ajax manager Louis van Gaal. It surprising Ajax looked clueless break strategy hardly unfamiliar Dutch sides. Their defenders occasionally brought ball forward impressively movement central midfield  thing Ajax famed  sorely lacking. The left-winger Amin Younes, renowned dribbling skills, tended drift inside early  left space United right-back, Antonio Valencia, sprint into. He burst forward couple occasions, stinging palms Andre Onana powerful shot. Right-sided Bertrand Traor Matteo Darmian excellent form, centre-forward Kasper Dolberg barely touch substituted hour. He appeared pace, notably beaten ball Daley Blind couple occasions. Physically United looked dominant, stronger quicker youthful, inexperienced opponents. There sense Ajax, drilled relentlessly specific philosophy, lacked Plan B. That understandable considering youthfulness side, developing individually collectively, having gone likely launch comeback. Mkhitaryan clever finish set-piece United 2-0 ahead meant pattern game defined. It classic performance Mourinho team European final  Porto 3-0 win Monaco 2004, Inter 2-0 victory Bayern Munich 2010. Sit back, soak pressure, counterattack. It Mourinho tried-and-tested approach, United fans tire watching 60 games season, generally proves extremely effective finals, Mourinho cup victories season Old Trafford.

A sunlit Leeds evening, rendered floodlights redundant 8.30pm, decorated one-day international components cracker late flurry wickets denied luxury vital ingredient, thrilling finish. In end England, having chalked 339 six, won 72 runs, surprisingly comfortable margin given firepower South Africa side. The pursuit 340 going tricky visitors question final half hour. In afternoon Eoin Morgan 11th ODI century, augmented quickfire 77 Moeen Ali, ensured set stiff target. Afterwards contented Morgan said: That best way started. It complete performance. Moeen [the man match] hardest jobs batting seven calm composed taking game them. It satisfying effort really strong team, especially given start bat. Despite early loss Quinton Kock, expertly caught Jos Buttler monumental skier, South Africa coasted serenely half pursuit  Hashim Amla straining crease. He caressed ball boundary times scoring 73 Faf du Plessis, hit 67, capable ally added 112 second wicket. After 24 overs probably favourites. Then Mark Wood crucial intelligent intervention. He endured torrid time, yielding 39 runs overs, Amla, exasperating habit hitting good balls four. But delivery Wood struck Amla left pad; appeal rejected subsequent request review justified. Then, over, admirable Liam Plunkett edge Du Plessis bat England firm foothold. But contend AB Villiers; match safe fielding remains crease. He lost JP Duminy David Miller, caught leg-side boundary. De Villiers rallied succession blistering boundaries confidence lower middle-order waning. He sought Moeen miscued safely caught 45 Plunkett. Thereafter England proceeded straightforward victory, marred concern fitness Ben Stokes, left field briefly bowled overs sore left knee.

It sixth-wicket partnership 117 rescued innings danger drifting course departure IPL boys, Stokes Buttler, quick succession. Morgan adroit helmsman 18th over. He sparkled spinners attacked discreetly loss wickets. Even reached century 90 balls whippy hook (the fifth innings) rusty Kagiso Rabada. He fell looking sixth 14 balls innings remaining. Moeen, easily underestimated required matches Ireland, offered critical assistance captain. He took sixes Imran Tahir skittish knock innings. His 77 occupied just 51 balls odd swish fresh air wonderfully clean hitting leg side. In 10 overs England conjured 102 runs good going, 21st century. Moeen scored 65 those.

Both Stokes Buttler neatly caught Miller, deep midwicket boundary, cunningly stationed leg gully. But Morgan Moeen calmly restored situation. That calmness evident field later evening. With unusual exception Stokes, slipped dropped catch long-off, ball hit air catches coolly taken. There moment final whistle Jos Mourinho went looking someone. This match come mean Manchester United injured players  Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Luke Shaw Eric Bailly  just attempted sprint centre-circle crutches. Then Mourinho saw son, modestly named Jos Jr, suddenly man boy rolling pitch. These euphoric scenes harrowing days, celebrations end went long way answering question football team Manchester consider happy ending season. Mourinho seen kissing trophy felt beneath him. It completes set United, trophy won before, changes complexion season remembered. Mourinho won 12 14 finals manager season United rivals managed past decade. He tried make case more, telling players forget Community Shield instructing hold fingers waited lift latest prize. It means United return Champions League season but, perhaps, presented opportunity dedicate prize city. Manchester healed loud, defiant songs and, yes, supposed minute silence match opportunity applaud sing. In small way, however, deeply moving, uplifting even, chants, again, honour city. Manchester, Manchester, Manchester, sang. The backdrop final difficult extreme but, Mourinho stated, United job went qualities usually associated teams. Granted, does mean exhilarating football great United sides, leaving Ajax coach, Peter Bosz, make number pithy remarks long-ball tactics difference terms size physicality. That, however, like debate day bearing mind happened Manchester Monday. We want dedicate victims, Ander Herrera said. The manager told thing win them. It culminated Wayne Rooney running last-minute substitute place lift trophy come way goals Paul Pogba Henrikh Mkhitaryan. If Rooney goodbye nice way players cavorting pitch care Bosz called boring game. Mourinho point. There poets football, said. But poets  do win titles. The downsides came conduct Ajax fans tore seats final whistle Herrera attempt opponent sent pretending felled headbutt. That apart, United reflect hugely satisfactory night Mourinho hardly blamed taking advantage fact bigger players. United second goal case point. Marouane Fellaini, difficult, awkward opponent, reach Juan Mata corner presence unsettled Ajax defenders. Chris Smalling head ball six-yard area Mkhitaryan hooked clever, improvisational finish. Ajax starting line-up average age 22 years 282 days, including players 21 younger, 17-year-old centre defence. What big-match experience teenage striker, Kasper Dolberg, identified main dangers, lasted just hour substituted. As Posz admitted: These young kids used playing finals. With exception Marcus Rashford, said winning team and, crucially, United luck too. Pogba 18th-minute shot ought straightforward save Andr Onana ball taken ricocheted Davinson Snchez, nearest defender. Onana moving left deflection turned ball centre goal. The goalkeeper stranded Pogba important, fortuitous, goal rejoining United summer. The strange Mourinho impassive stage, hardly wearing expression man seen team lead European final. The game early stages half wore on, Ajax playing creative fluent game. Mkhitaryan goal timed well, minutes second half, manager demeanour changed entirely end. Just fractured relationships blighting southern hemisphere rugby union seemingly deteriorate further, new issue brewing likely add strain. The relations Sanzaar Super Rugby clubs hardly lower ebb, urgent need governance reform showpiece competition highlighted recent months.

The ARU baulked holding EGM required giving 21 days' notice instead offered hold informal meeting stakeholder seven days. This meeting held Sydney Friday, postponed. As result ARU hold EGM weeks' time. The axing Australian team main item agenda rescheduled meeting, issue hardly going help matters. Sanzaar proposed starting date year Super Rugby competition brought forward week, means kick 17 February. This allow All Blacks, Springboks Wallabies extra week prepare bound Tests June European opposition. Historically, southern hemisphere teams won 90% June Tests professional era, re-emergence England world superpower Australian coach Eddie Jones folks south getting nervous. Remember Wallabies 2016. South Africa host England year South Africans pushed change date, supported Australia New Zealand. The Australian New Zealand Super Rugby teams happy it. For winter sport Super Rugby starts early summer month. The New Zealand sides particular difficult attract crowds time year. In Australia 17 February kick-off immediately follow International 10s Brisbane Sydney Sevens previous week, ideal. An earlier start season means chance teams missing key international players round two. It clearly best interests Super Rugby competition struggling credibility, especially Australia. And highlights fact Super Rugby teams little control destinies. The Sanzaar nations administer Super Rugby competition. The teams participate just that, participants. The clubs real say competition play run. Sanzaar consult clubs issues like, end day clubs powerless fate. There doubt All Blacks, Springboks Wallabies main revenue generators game respective countries interests national teams come first. But area economic growth southern hemisphere rugby Super Rugby clubs need treated partners, invitees party.

As major final talk trophies, transfers victory mean club. If United win Europa League club complete set major trophies secure Champions League berth season longer forefront people minds.

Its shape familiar fans golf claret jug, known Auld Mug. It sailing thing. The America Cup named country boat won 1851, America, which, fair, American. Had race Isle Wight ended won different competing vessel known Freak Cup, better it. Hideous. Four nations won it: Australia once, New Zealand Switzerland twice United States frankly monotonous 28 times. Britain boast champion  Sir Thomas Lipton, founder tea company, tried failed win times 19th century eventually given trophy troubles, officially-designated best losers. About years ago, ask, crews competed preparatory races globe. At end Land Rover BAR  Team GB  came top, taking bonus points qualifiers start Bermuda Friday. That slightly controversial point. They sailing mindbogglingly hi-tech catamarans just 50ft length, majority teams voted 2015 shrink hulls 62ft versions named original protocol. The decision caused Italian team, Luna Rossa, withdraw high dudgeon Patrizio Bertelli, boss, complain 17m lavished project gone drain. That end large wedge. It starts $2m entry fee, paid nearly years ago, rises rapidly there. It estimated Team USA successful defence title 2013 cost team backers $200m. The teams  that Sweden Artemis Racing, Emirates Team New Zealand, Groupama Team France, SoftBank Team Japan, Oracle Team USA Land Rover BAR  races team head-to-head twice, winners occasion scoring point. At end whichever team pile eliminated. As holders Team USA straight final remaining challengers face best-of-nine semi-finals finals, winners earning right challenge USA, actual proper America Cup match, best-of-13 affair starts 17 June.

At 25% team come country represent, world oyster. All teams developed sets foils, mounted hull lift boat water picks speed: light breezes stronger winds. Like F1 teams tyres, decide day ones mount  means changing minds mid-race. These calls prove decisive. For competitors there jolly it. The America Cup difficult win, said Sir Peter Blake, two-time victor Team New Zealand. It game winning impossible  almost, impossible. And worth fighting for. It difficulty gives challenge sense. This essence life itself. Visiting country watch team contest European final far zenith existence  better finishing fourth league. And way, occasions taken granted. Real Madrid, easily Europe successful club, absent 1986 1998, 2002 2014. Accordingly, incumbent match-goer enjoy opportunity fullest extent, knows come along? But, football, rarely easy be. Thanks various corporations seeking maximum cash minimum effort, soon Manchester United Ajax won Europa League semi-finals, flights Stockholm England Netherlands sharply increased price; does pleasure pressure. A simple case supply demand, say A-level economists, love addiction involved football impute moral dimension. People pour time, money hope watching teams entitled biggest games, free fair. Though airline ticket pricing game governing bodies, Thomas Cook paid Manchester United, shudders think much, order run official trips. Presumably, partnership allows charge fans thought pay  case 499, 500 just much. United felt need cap subsidise this. Still, numerous reasons swerve official trip alternative options. Before United won quarter-final, flights bought 170, given weakness field, gambled lost left far greater worries unwanted ticket Stockholm. But making work required cash credit, confidence misfiring team ability withstand loss. Another way ameliorating situation longer holiday. Flights cost less, money saved simply repatriated spent elsewhere, ultimate effect making things more, expensive. The other, probably better, option fly nearby city  Gothenburg Malmo, say  travelling rest way overland. Journeys ilk tend involve long, leisurely refreshing train rides, fringe benefits avoiding jester-hat cringe zealous police long possible. Though prevailing airlines Uefa, helping accommodation be. When finals doled out, discussions bidding cities focus bed numbers affordability, better way. Why ask municipalities prevent hotels, fuller usual making money food drink usual, raising prices? This tricky administrate legal practical perspective, intention understanding nonetheless. Uefa power match tickets, hand, absolute, instance priced 150, 100, 70 40. This appalling, significantly higher Champions League final prices  450, 317, 162 69, charged larger ground guaranteed sell  suggest desire maximise profit. For context, ticket 1999 Champions League final cost 12 then, money coming game sponsorship broadcasting rights increased exponential rate; need lean supporters paying transport, accommodation sundries. It reasonable costs covered final  fact final  ethos twenty plenty apply. These prices, though, affect lucky ticket. On night, Friends Arena capacity 48,000  ideal match featuring clubs well-supported United Ajax. That say biggest games simply rotate large venues; Europa League finals, entirely inappropriate. On that, trip first-time final host far cloying Champions League paying Wembley mortgage twice seasons 2011 2013, travel regularly games, treat visit usual circuit. Even context, impossible defend allocation 17,000 tickets public sale just 10,000 clubs. United average home attendance 75,290 Ajax 49,619. Last season, despite final venue capacity 35,000, Liverpool given 10,236 tickets. Football parochial emotive, huge people heritage identity; Uefa selling, suitable atmosphere created. Though nice locals enjoy final jaunt, essential, ought numbers expense partisans followed team competition. The applies Uefa 11,000-strong family  loins really  perfectly happy watching home. That neutrals end doing, judging number tickets sale secondary market identity competing clubs known. It true Uefa idea teams reach final  Celta Vigo Lyon won through, fewer fans travelled selling neutrals later stage harder. Of course, important grounds full, way. If, weeks, 20,000 United Ajax fans means Stockholm, period authorities able make leftover tickets available local children accompanying adults, cheap free. Uefa motto we care football; looking fans fine way living it. In monochrome Glasgow childhood, Lisbon came insinuate itself misty consciousness. Long I knew foreign city discovered source significance adults family, Lisbon took place four-year-old lexicon places destinations. In 1967 stretched Granny house, the garden the bad fire. Gradually, birthday parties, communions endless baptisms, propaganda dad uncles began form settle. When time came attend school, story Lisbon Jock Stein Celtic Internazionale stitched mind.

A years later I clearly recall heated conversation uncles visiting priest subject special papal dispensations. The bewildered padre asked pronounce case Stein saint basis that, was Catholic, delivered requisite verifiable miracle. In later school years, long working grasp basic Lisbon narrative established, friends I took turns distinguish rarefied knowledge; obtained hours extracurricular study. This, course, subject degree exaggeration. Did know Billy McNeill conducted press conferences away legs language hosts? That required Celtic captain possessed working knowledge French, Swiss, Yugoslavian, Czechoslovakian Portuguese challenged. And know dad pal fiance ditched used deposit new house fly Lisbon? In early years followed Celtic triumph Lisbon, book came recognised bible occurred game. Celtic Triumphant written highly respected football journalist Ian Peebles remains day ultimate authority matches Celtic played season, anecdotes recollections players people there. Many books written decades freshness, authenticity sheer sense wonder Peebles' work, penned immediate aftermath Lisbon, matched. At university I discovered friend Aidan McLaughlin I shared guilty secret: memorised entire paragraphs Celtic Triumphant. This Peebles' recollection Steve Chalmers' winning goal Lisbon: Then, minutes end, delight Scots obvious satisfaction foreign journalists me, Steve Chalmers scored winner pass Murdoch fine ball Gemmell Great. Said leading Swiss writer: It wonderful  Celtic team forwards!' A Frenchman smiled said: We play game way now.' Being Scot National Stadium moment supreme status symbol. Meanwhile, token resistance sympathetic police cordon, Celtic supporters took control field. On level, Celtic 2-1 victory European Cup final Internazionale, champions Italy, stand Scotland greatest sporting achievement. Football then, now, popular sport world terms participation commerce. That squad consisting purely men west Scotland advantages privileges finance sports science win world premier football tournament considered improbable then. It regarded well-nigh impossible now. Yet, Celtic victory carried significance mere fact Scottish team Britain prevail football prestigious club tournament. Lisbon '67 watershed moment Scotland cultural, social political levels. Let consider style design Celtic play defeating successful clubs modern era. If outside west Scotland asked imagine type football favoured team Glasgow deployed words utilitarian, industrial no-nonsense. Glasgow 1960s No Mean City phase; black white city heavy industry, joyless drinking casual violence. A football team place hard, aggressive inelegant. It prisoners. There light joy Celtic play exuberance commonly associate Latin African countries. It belied grime industrial drudgery places Lisbon Lions reared. Sure, snowflakes Stein instilled good old-fashioned Presbyterian work ethic approach. Yet, Celtic progressed 1966-67 European Cup, foreign journalists supporters surprised high levels skill enlightened tactics, demanded outfield player quick feet sharp brains. Within years Dutch coaches footballers lauded having invented concept total football. In truth though, Celtic playing way years. Before Celtic won European Cup, prolonged exposure Scotland enjoyed mass audience Hollywood classics Whisky Galore Brigadoon. On afternoon 25 May 1967 global audience sat hours watch authentically Scottish product prevail searching conditions. The product seen charismatic attractive and, minds 40 million foreigners, mental recalibration previously held thoughts Scotland Scots took place. Did Scotland enjoy rare wee jag confidence hour? Did experience precious minutes feel like citizen famous, beautiful countries endlessly favoured Hollywood location directors? We Scots tetchy disputatious, plagued confidence issues, forever soliciting people opinions us. In chapter Celtic Triumphant, author observed rapturous afterwards: There Celtic Rangers supporters; Protestants Catholics; Pakistanis pop fans; rooting Parkhead players Lisbon. As final whistle blew, impromptu jig danced lounge carpet lifelong Rangers followers admitted lump throat could control. In Celtic triumph discovered Scotland well-regarded countries.

You said Liverpool British club shirt sponsor (Hitachi 1979), Liverpool doubtless professional club sponsored, I pretty sure Kettering beat years. This wind-up. Maybe confirm it? asked Jon Cudby 2000. Having spoken Kettering club historian Mel Hopkins, Jon, indeed. When Wolves striker Derek Dougan retired football summer 1975, joined Southern League club Kettering Town chief executive. Within month appointment, brokered four-figure deal local firm Kettering Tyres, game Bath City 24 January 1976, Kettering British club run company emblazoned shirts. Sadly, groundbreaking new strip run-out. Four days later, FA predictably ordered club remove new slogan, despite Dougan claim ruling body 1972 ban sponsorship writing. Characteristically, Dougan did body blow lying down. He cheekily changed wording shirts Kettering T, claimed stood Town whatsoever Tyres. For couple heady months, team played new slogan. Sure enough, however, Kettering soon FA, ordered remove words Kettering T strip. The threat 1,000 fine small club, words reluctantly removed. There final irony. Kettering did let matter lie  all, clubs like Bayern Munich coining continent years  so, Derby Bolton, forward proposal FA regarding shirt sponsorship. But proposal accepted 3 June 1977, Kettering sponsor upcoming season. Meanwhile, Derby players began season running Saab shirts Saab cars. Where justice?

Angela Lee wants people think typical young woman, that difficult accept considering she done. I normal person happens fighter world champion, Lee, 20, tells Guardian. The Canadian-born, Hawaii-raised fighter says giggle undeniable sincerity. Many people life, including make money her, paint picture athlete poised breakout big Asia  father Singapore mother South Korean  time continent beginning follow mixed martial arts ways unable before. Asian audiences just starting engage Asian content. All we access North American European content. We prolific producing quality Asian content. I talking world-class content. Sports soap operas, it new, said promoter Victor Cui, CEO International ONE Championship, MMA promotion focused building stars Lee Asia. The way I look this: Asia used seeing global icons martial arts, like Michelle Yeoh Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. Seeing talented female martial artist foreign Asia, I think Angela readily accepted. I do think there ceiling Lee potential, added Cui, ESPN executive. Lee, unbeaten seven fights professional MMA career, deserves mention alongside heart-pounding prospects sport. Lee captured championship belt ONE atomweight division year, defending time March positioned breakout fighter Asian descent years, potential widespread fame looming. At start Lee career Asia quizzed background heritage. Soon learned respond. She half-Korean, half-Chinese Singaporean, told people, born Canada raised Hawaii. That kind mouthful, Lee explained, media fan bases different parts Asia began understand story quickly accepted her. I mix I think that plus. It gives experience culturally knowing I different places world. Lee shaped women pioneers came  Gina Carano, Cris Cyborg Ronda Rousey. It want pursue more, Lee said. I training competing seeing thing TV able travel love, just really inspired me. I thought mind I was going make it. My great grandma actually watches fights. She scared anything. I think that kind runs blood family. We fighters sense. Unlike Carano, Cyborg Rousey, earliest experiences martial arts Lee molded competitor arsenal. That foundation produced dynamic aggressive fighter, point sought finish opponents variety ways. Coming martial arts family introduced sport young age, I just kind grew it, Lee said. This I kind knew. Martial arts huge life  been. I did second option came career choice. I did myself teacher doctor like that. I knew I wanted MMA related. Observers mixed fighting anticipated emergence young competitors versed aspects MMA  striking wrestling  moment stepped cage. Lee certainly example that, talent boon ONE Championship. The promotion, partner Singaporean government, signed Lee ahead professional debut 2015 quickly doubled contract Lee highest paid female fighters MMA. My advantage beginning I learned mixed martial arts whole, Lee said. You transition standup ground between. Because Lee stable 450 fighters, ONE experienced explosive growth past years, claiming 10 50 times exposure Asia compared industry leading UFC. We fortunate common denominator world, martial arts, said Cui. It sport truly Asian. It home martial arts 5,000 years. Every country core form martial arts they fiercely proud of. So actually country do need teach anybody sport, bringing ice hockey country need teach Edmonton Oilers go. But you five-year-old kid 105-year-old grandmother know best martial artists like people come there explain. Considering MMA business model quarter century old, potential Asia challenge UFC dominance dismissed. We early days, literally scratching surface opportunity is, Cui said. I think you going content TV ratings starting dominate combination live broadcast, sport, local heroes simplicity rules. If continue exponentially grow social media content, man, hit billion impressions quarter took year year I really shocked. The potential audience Asia Cui excited. During panel discussion Asia entrepreneurs earlier month Los Angeles, Cui noted China poised spend $18tn sports 20 years. In 2016, Cui moved office Singapore Shanghai focus developing Chinese business. The advantage Asia rest world does want Bruce Lee is, Cui said. They want Asian athlete [in combat sports]. There legitimate fans Asians going best world. That common sport. No waiting Chinese champion tennis. In March, Lee visited Shanghai conduct workshop Nike. Unlike US, big brands remained reticent fully support MMA  especially embarrassing mishaps likes troubled UFC champion Jon Jones prompted Nike pull MMA North America  Asian business ripe promotion. Disney Marvel, example, partnered ONE Championship launch films Asian audience. Lee big plus promotion intending make inroads Asia. [Brands] inclined Angela Lee working them, said Cui. If fluent Chinese amazing. The central figure Europa League final man profoundly absent: Johan Cruyff. The player, coach guru died 14 months ago thrilling young Ajax emerged past couple months built image according principles. There precedents speed, scale significance team transformation. Last August, Ajax lost 4-1 Rostov Champions League qualifier dire performance confirm once-great Dutch club irreversible decline recently month, notion Ajax sweep European final 1996 absurd. But manager, Peter Bosz, season, slowly building remarkable. The sign afoot came stunning victory leg quarter-final Schalke weeks ago. It like watching 1974 World Cup team, says Auke Kok, Cruyff biographer. I thought I'd Ajax team playing way again. Ajax won 2-0 scored ferocity pressing daring use high offside line pen opponents reminiscent total football. No quite believe seeing feeling stadium non-Dutch non-Ajax, people players body. It intimidating emotional release fans who'd watching disappointing, boring games long. Almost impressive fighting spirit saw Ajax recover near-disaster second leg. Schalke scored goals Ajax rallied scored twice near end reach four. The semi-final Lyon followed similar pattern: stunning home victory  time 4-1  followed wobble second leg, staved surprising resilience Ajax won 5-4 aggregate. Many outsiders assume Ajax new team simply serenely doing  nurturing young talent  happened. Many key players, Colombian defender Davinson Snchez Moroccan midfielder Hakim Ziyech, arrived season. More importantly, new Bosz old boss. Under previous manager, Frank Boer, Ajax won successive Dutch titles but, devout attachment mentor Louis van Gaal principles possession patient buildup, team took 20 minutes manage shot goal. The club recent history tumultuous. In 2011, frustrated years mediocrity, Cruyff led group players forced old management. Unfortunately, Cruyff Revolution followed pattern French Russian ones. With old regime gone, insurrectionists turned supporters Cruyff battled Van Gaal. Even Dutch football standards, dispute bitter. Lawyers got involved, lifelong friendships broken. In conflict centred personality clash  Cruyff Van Gaal loathed  philosophical issue going time Cruyff coach Rinus Michels co-created total football early 70s. Cruyff Van Gaal loved spatially sophisticated attacking football club reputation rests crucial differences. Following Michels, Van Gaal faith systems rigid application tactics. Cruyff believed giving talented players freedom looser tactical structure. In 2011 Cruyff, wanted players run club, triumphed followers soon fell favourite, Wim Jonk, eventually sacked friends. In late 2015, Cruyff diagnosed lung cancer. His public appearance, weeks died, came short video photographs taken Israel son Jordi, technical director Maccabi Tel Aviv. Largely unremarked time fact Bosz, Maccabi manager, present. Cruyff death 24 March triggered huge outpouring emotion Netherlands, celebrated mainly achievements player. Commentators stayed tactfully silent revolution saw blemish career. It Cruyff gave dreams Ajax pictures acquired new resonance. Bosz long admired Cruyff. His main influence Pep Guardiola, Cruyff protege disciple. Likewise, Jordi Johan Cruyff fans Bosz, mainly attacking football teams played manager Heracles Vitesse Arnhem Netherlands. For years Jordi tried persuade Bosz join Maccabi and, January year, got man. The idea appointment stepping stone Netherlands written contract. Bosz return home manage Ajax Amsterdam club wanted him. We know Jordi, Johan, suggested Bosz Ajax directors, talents fitted desire attacking football. Either way, popular De Boer chose leave  eventually joining Internazionale ill-fated spell  Bosz got job. It clear early March 2016 Bosz transformative experience. He Cruyff spent week talking. We do know exactly said but, Bosz said: In week I learned 10 years. He cites Cruyff constantly putting ideas practice. Ruud Gullit warned pursuing romantic Cruyffian ideas doomed fail modern football. Bosz persisted slowly taught team play aggressive pressing game tend associate Guardiola Jrgen Klopp, originated Cruyff Ajax Holland teams 70s. Like Cruyff, Bosz gives players confidence risks urges play hard, creative express themselves. The flowering players tutelage remarkable. Snchez, 20, rapidly maturing defender authority charisma Velibor Vasovic, tough Serbian captain Ajax late 60s early 70s. Davy Klaassen, previously struggled role prime creator, reborn combative midfielder team leader. Andr Onana, considered calamity-prone reserve goalkeeper, sensational. The defenders Nick Viergever 17-year-old Matthijs Ligt improved astonishing degree. All team, progress individual inspire contribute whole. The new creation fragile new Ajax easily lose experienced Manchester United, off-field finances probably pose greater danger development. After helping Ajax win Champions League 1995, Jari Litmanen famously urged fellow players team together. They ignored best young decade soon disintegrated. This month club bewitching new midfield star, Ziyech, plea. It probably work. The lure bigger, richer clubs surely draw away Ajax crop young stars.

There quite interesting races scattered programme Wednesday, including Listed Rothesay Stakes fillies mares Ayr, seven-furlong handicap Yarmouth offer best bet day Realize (4.30) attempts record win turf July 2013.

James Rodrguez Manchester United? Not Chelsea it. The champions said keen Colombian confident landing him, especially United do Champions League football offer. So that thing riding tonight Europa League final, Jos Mourinho reputation. Clarence Seedorf won Champions Leagues Mourinho and, indeed, Manchester United. And Dutchman says wants manage England. Hmmmn. Would pass Sunderland/Middlesbrough test? From 1996 2013, members executive committee Fifa, body runs world football, American businessman manufacturer smiley-face badges called Chuck Blazer. For time, Blazer general secretary Confederation North, Central America Caribbean Association Football (Concacaf), half dozen international federations Fifa helps fund. At Blazer instigation, Concacaf rented offices apartments Trump Tower Manhattan. One apartments sole use Blazer cats. They peed floor, Guardian journalist David Conn records, and place stink. When comes moral shortcomings modern football, writers exactly short metaphors. The challenge opposite: make people love game despite want read catalogue off-pitch horrors. Since 2010, Conn writes, seven members 22-man Fifa executive committee charged accused US authorities criminal wrongdoing; another, Franz Beckenbauer, criminal investigation Switzerland Germany  Germany 2006 World Cup bid [he maintains innocence]. Six members, including [Sepp] Blatter [Michel] Platini, sanctioned Fifa ethics committee. For years now, Fifa associated corruption, bribery, cronyism seedily close relationships corporations, dictatorships repressive governments  football carried expanding regardless, just world favourite sport arguably dominant mass culture. What difference anti-Fifa book make? Conn begins brief, pointedly innocent chapter, entitled The People Game, appreciation football simple, natural qualities, started child early 1970s. It obvious opening  70s football memoir standard non-fiction crowd-pleaser  useful one, Britain recent investigative writing football feels it people do actually like sport. Conn heartfelt portrait Dutch great Johan Cruyff, elegant imagining sinuous play 1974 World Cup, serves contrast unlovely Fifa patriarchs come. Founded 1904 tiny organisation arrange matches half dozen European countries  England, older, self-important football culture, declined initial invitation join  Fifa retained element restraint high-mindedness seven decades. It established World Cup, rapidly absorbed football associations continents, moved headquarters Paris Zurich financially transparent Switzerland. Yet late 60s early 70s president Sir Stanley Rous, conscientious English referee refused paid salary. Conn admires Rous, point. Rous belief sport remain uncontaminated outside world, Fifa saw political stances, led maintain relations apartheid South Africa Augusto Pinochet dictatorship Chile. In 1973, Soviet Union objected playing World Cup qualifier Chilean stadium used, weeks earlier, centre torture murder political prisoners, Fifa refused let Russians Chile venue instead, excluded tournament. The following year, Rous challenged defeated elected Fifa presidency Joo Havelange, rich, white Brazilian businessman links country military government, shamelessly shrewdly presented himself radical alternative: champion poorer football-playing countries, European colonies. Unlike British journalists, steadily outraged Fifa behaviour Britain influence organisation waned, Conn judicious assesses Havelange tainted successor, Blatter. Havelange did, question, help himself bribes, Conn writes. The Brazilian played central instituting culture corruption Fifa  culture favours strategically handed reliably reciprocated, helped office quarter century, 1974 1998. Yet Conn points Havelange Fifa power-seeking, greed idealism disentangled. Havelange used presidency hugely expand World Cup Fifa income, distributing proceeds, promised, non-European countries. Afterwards, remained honorary Fifa president 2013, bribe-taking finally officially exposed. He 96 years old. But central interesting character book Blatter. Conn introduces early, barely 40 pages in, returns often, times book feels unbalanced. Chapter chapter lays malign dimensions tenure Fifa, eventually uncovered, passage written dense, demanding prose traditional investigative journalism. The material startling, allowed breathe enough. Amid exposition, details stand out: incessant gifts football associations Fifa grandees  $1,983 spent AFC [Asian Football Confederation]  14 shirts Blatter; whistleblower tiny Bahamas football association bravely exposing bribery operation brown envelope cash trousers; centre excellence football Trinidad, built at $25.95m Fifa money, including conference banquet halls ... hotel ... swimming-pool complex pitches e visitor tells Conn did football going on. By 2010s, Blatter Fifa two-faced Havelange: issuing grander public declarations football force global good, internally a totalitarian world patronage dependence, Conn puts it, allowing outrage show, occasionally tellingly does. In 2011, despite widening revelations closest Fifa allies, Blatter re-elected president 92% vote. One keys longevity Fifa, started work 1975, power personal enrichment. Conn writes carefully Blatter appears indulged  crude corruption, predecessor executive committee members did. How Blatter knew corruption, tolerated encouraged secure position, question Conn does explicitly answer. There multiple ongoing investigations Fifa president, Conn wants to fair Blatter, phrase encounter British journalism. But does underline book evidence pointing: This history organisation  shows rottenness set top. Conn wants o fair Blatter', underlines he rottenness set top' Blatter presidency finally terminated Fifa ethics committee  consider contradiction terms  2015. Conn experienced worldly reporter, illusions Blatter Fifa ultimately unravelled. One crucial whistleblowers, Conn shows, Blazer, himself had taking kickbacks embezzling money  years, decided excesses Fifa executive, Jack Warner, blatant threatened gravy train continuation. Fifa president Gianni Infantino, self-declared reformer. But Conn remains sceptical, noting clear similarities rise power, based relentless lobbying football executives worldwide, Havelange Blatter. This book cumulative power, piling betrayal betrayal, include Conn childhood idols 1974 World Cup, German player Franz Beckenbauer. Always upright exquisite playing style, decades later offering 1,000 tickets Warner 2006 World Cup, held Germany. There gaps narrative. There lack first-hand reporting facilities poor countries Fifa may, not, effectively funded. Many Conn requests talk protagonists turned down. But book ends beautifully expansive interview Blatter, deposed, Fifa lavish hilltop restaurant Zurich. While Conn eats cte boeuf porcini of deep flavour, thunderstorm swirls outside, 80-year-old Blatter turns frail, uncomprehending fall, manipulative ever. Football good game slippery people.

Unafraid lighting proverbial cauldron, David Warner week gave life worst-case scenario ever-freezing pay stalemate Cricket Australia Australian Cricketers' Association. The inferred threat simple: current model retained, play. The Bull goes bang, said Ed Cowan reference Warner comments Twitter, statement intent keeping called The Bull. It set train raft hypotheticals kept speculation bubbling: Ashes opponents England feel it? Who pay lost revenue? Will Australian cricketers cross picket-fence, picket-line earn baggy green? While Warner comments marked highest-pressure point issue shows signs abating, sides quick hose notion Ashes, Ashes England Australia best grade cricketers. A CA spokesman confirmed Guardian Australia confidence this negotiation affect Australian cricket. They bullish words corporation complete control conciliatory undertaking assure public actual cricket is threat. Similarly, ACA publicly sought dilute Warner boycott musings, privately concede cricket strike disastrous result too. Both sides want cricket played, remain acutely aware contrivance hugely damaging parties. However, packed Gabba 23 November does necessarily mean memorandum understanding place. If impasse continues 30 June deadline, Australian runs wickets occur short-term, essentially-workaround agreements. That there options sentiment echoes sides ledger, appear agreed MOU  preferred parties  precondition Ashes series. We cricket. In meantime, curious public relations battle ploughs on. It battle largely drawn top-line, clichd political frames: CA union-busting corporate behemoth run hawkish business types seeking maximum returns; ACA proud collection workers leaders champion solidarity, sacrifice partnership pursuit fair share. So far, players' resolve impressive. Across platforms, publications pubs, message wavered. They remain resolute revenue share model  fortunes rise and, overlook, fall, commercial outcomes game  mechanism used. It solidarity rooted commitment coin insistence status. And deadline looms current MOU, zero signs relenting. Across country, journalists opening contact books combing professional ranks mere hint concern, foot step. There none, stand reason. Australian cricketers not, do pretend be, industrial relations experts. But sport leaves mentally prepared recognise handle bit gamesmanship it. When comes ruthlessness intimidation, takes know one. However context, Warner comments delivered wallop intended, slight miscue. As leading Australian player  financially benefit CAs proposal short-term  preparedness withdraw labour solidarity colleagues undoubtedly noble. But colourfully articulating prospect player strike Australian summer, risked ire public largely time inclination study fine details industrial relations dispute. Warner trying moral thing good reason, mountain messaging stop increasingly headline-driven world equating player strike player greed. It scenario weaken ACA position, partly explains attempts reframe conversation edging money principle. Meanwhile, CA public silence remains slightly mystifying. They maintain it driven dignified commitment avoid negotiation media, surely leave vacuum it. Perhaps expanded media arm they planning makes sense all. Surely, proposing fundamental change status players game, incumbent carry burden explaining rationale it. Because ACA pushes forward public cogent demonstrations real influence strength negotiations, 30 June far away vague-sounding promises increased funding grassroots cricket, game administrative body remains hushed, oddly so. While feel entitled greater control game finances  good reason feel way  relative silence means image hard-edged, uncompromising corporation prevails. Perhaps that like it, too.

Even so, Morgan insists bowlers chasing wickets 21st century way. If somebody bowls bouncer fine leg, it problem trying stay ahead batsman, catch guard, especially he in'. Doing obscure try batsman out, I do mind all. Such liberal view gust fresh air bowlers.

Second series I New Zealand Richard Hadlee. Third series, I played England Angus Fraser really bowled well. Devon Malcolm good. Eddie Hemmings bowled Old Trafford. Oh God, I think myself. He going bowler performed single Test series  no, Test match  played. He does quite that, proceeds Australia series, South Africa series. He moves consider impossibility choosing Warne, Muralitharan Saqlain. Or Walsh Ambrose. Aware time marching on, I try ask question, I obviously getting response one. He proceeds placidly, speaking attempts change subject. What I liked comparing players. I believed respecting individual achieved life, challenges they met with, disciplined life they led. Quite guys lifestyles. Lifestyles? How here? You ca compare West Indian lifestyle Australian lifestyle, ways they worked really hard they it. You just need respect that. When finally stops speaking minutes elapsed, I got I wanted answer, managed sound gracious wide range bowlers acknowledging  Jimmy Anderson, Glenn McGrath Allan Donald  really challenge authority. Half frustrated, half wants stand applaud. That, I realise, felt like bowl Sachin Tendulkar best. But feel like Sachin Tendulkar I harder time imagining I have come near answer reading autobiography, Playing It My Way, talking room, cricket honours boards view pitch Tendulkar reached 91 runs house 2011 out, chasing 100th 100 international cricket  following year man achieve distinction. What feel like I wonder precisely cricket like Sachin Tendulkar, will. This just question talent longevity (both truly remarkable unmatchable), India history. When Tendulkar played Test, 1989, India closed economy. Three years later, opened global market. Globalisation brought international sponsorship, market power, satellite channels broadcast cricket match gave airtime experts dissect aspect game  later, social media gave non-experts platforms same. Cricket national passion India, means expressing consuming passion magnified extraordinary degree. Globalisation brought about, countries, surge nationalism. And Tendulkar  started international career, admission, all sea fearsome Pakistani bowling attack, rapidly went batsman demolish opposition  ultimate symbol increasingly confident, powerful India. By time retired 2013, age 40, nickname  accurately, title  devotees God. The forthcoming film Sachin: A Billion Dreams, promoting London morning picking Asian Fellowship award Asian awards, charts parallel journey man nation. I hear producer sitting interview. Tendulkar has raised issue discussing film, says wanted make fans learn story early days, generation inspired it. Once Test player everything captured. It live action world retakes, [the fans] know that, guys know childhood, challenges struggles I went through. This fine good interesting story Tendulkar India intertwined trajectories  particularly struggles talks do involve difficulty getting crowded Mumbai bus kit bag. I ask significance playing India opposed playing county Indian Premier League team, does want privilege team another. I respected cricket. It really did matter I played, I gave best. He written autobiography meaningful play national team, I know he deflecting question, I believe completely speaks respect game. It makes want hear talk match-fixing cricket  huge scandal blighted sport, smeared Indian team  personally  playing. He barely mentions autobiography, extraordinary omission, does discuss film. I know two-minute preview, I allowed see. Why omission decision speak it? He tells talk I seen film. He ca away that there, released I watched it, I question  sure. I ask injuries suffered career, thought recover return game. Yes, says, surgery tennis elbow could lift son bat, which plastic bat. How feel? Oh, terrible. I sleep night. I close friends ask join long drives. There genuine desolation voice, sentences said washed disappeared images stand  Titan unable lift plastic bat spends nights driving streets Mumbai, unable sleep, unwilling alone. It raises question life like retirement  admittedly, retiring 40 terms different matter forced game injury 32. But so, man life age 16 40 dominated cricket. In fact, 11 started play, quickly singled coach deserved particular attention; father poet professor and, Tendulkar says, days people laugh suggestion sports studies route career, convinced parents set aside conventional thinking. When 12, moved parents' home uncle aunt house closer school cricket ground days week played practice match early afternoon followed individual training 7.30pm. His parents visited aunt uncle work days done. The idea cricket  including Tendulkar  order lives carried adulthood. In film preview hear wife say: Cricket came came second  understood that. So, years in, does retirement sit man life dominated cricket long? Very good. I enjoying it. It easily shortest answer given me. Does play sport all? I have played quite time. But does mean I coming future. I remind interview cricket writer Sambit Bal years ago, Bal mentioned criticism Tendulkar received using huge influence talk important issues. At time, Tendulkar response focusing cricket. But view role India longer playing and, 2012, held 12 nominated seats upper house Indian parliament. Although position conferred honour, expectation nominated MPs play role parliamentary discussions, areas life Tendulkar publicly criticised poor attendance record upper house. I talk issues I feel comfortable with. If speaking 25 guys, 25 guys different suggestions [about do], end eventually boils I want life. And does want life? I doing that. I doing I feel, I 25 years, people liked that. So, I changing. People change, I changing. I following path. The truth is, is following path  time pre-adolescence. After retirement autobiography, film  projects allowed inhabit role great batsman. But next? Already India question asked Virat Kohli, current Indian cricket megastar, route eclipsing Tendulkar career. If limelight exacting, half step away cruel. But thinking that, I assuming needs limelight  truth is, I idea needs. Given intensely scrutinised quarter century, ability private self private miracle compact brilliance playing style.

The San Antonio Spurs' season wins short franchise sixth championship, swept Golden State Warriors outscored 84 points final half games Western Conference Finals. So concludes finest coaching performance Gregg Popovich 21 seasons leading Spurs. San Antonio line-up Game 4 defeat showed little Popovich work end. Patty Mills, Danny Green, Jonathon Simmons, what left LaMarcus Aldridge Manu Ginobili getting honorary start final game remarkable NBA career. On sidelines MVP candidate Kawhi Leonard, ankle injury late half Game 1 Golden State Zaza Pachulia accidentally undercut (or committed basketball manslaughter, depending point view). San Antonio playing future Hall Fame point guard Tony Parker role player David Lee. And carnage came season Spurs played Tim Duncan Bob Dole Republican candidate president. Transitioning franchise legend sets franchise quite long way. Yet Popovich Spurs went 61-21 season, good second-best record NBA. Even losing second franchise legend playoffs Parker went did them. Popovich gave heavier minutes Mills 20-year old point guard Dejounte Murray  San Antonio pick No29 June draft  San Antonio closed Rockets team thought itself legit title contender games, taking Game 6 final score 114-75 was nearly close digits suggest. For extra bonus points, Spurs' humiliation Rockets series finale came Leonard, sat game tender ankle. Leonard returned Game 1 Conference Finals vengeance, scoring 26 points 24 minutes Spurs built 23-point lead halfway quarter. And collapsed. Popovich won NBA coach year just times 21 seasons. Likewise, LeBron James deemed league MVP times 14 seasons is finalist award year. Both men consistently excellent there urge voters punish feel need honor coach player year surely Pop LeBron opportunities win individual awards road. But fair, man double-digit trophies rightly complain. Maybe better idea just NBA coach year award Pop Trophy wo matter to.

The Spurs pick better No24 draft 20 years, 2010 selected ... wait ... 20th overall. Twenty consecutive playoff appearances row, picking lottery portion draft landing Tim Duncan 1997. Trust process. Despite franchise titles, Spurs anybody title pick heading new season. They anti-New England Patriots despite having number championships. But Ginobili retires, Parker soon follows him, Spurs right contention year, probably aided solid contributor taken 29th draft international import outside San Antonio office heard of. While Leonard transitioned team go-to player Duncan final years, it remarkable San Antonio churned right season longtime stoneface franchise. The 1990s Bulls did make conference semis Michael Jordan Tebow'ing minor league baseball; Jordan Pippen split years later, Chicago did crack 30 wins years. The Jazz missed playoffs consecutive years Karl Malone John Stockton. The Celtics were factor 15 years Larry Bird retired. No idea post-Kobe Lakers doing Mavericks falling oblivion Dirk Nowitzki has retired yet. But Year 1 AD (After Duncan), Popovich Spurs just ankle-slaughter away taking 1-0 lead star-packed Golden State Warriors. Who knows happened there. Usually things happen world work family friends do, Popovich said Conference Finals. To day, I feel like there cloud, pall country paranoid, surreal sort way ... It way individual conducts himself, that embarrassing. It dangerous institutions stand expect country be. For individual, he game show. Everything happens begins ends him, people country.

Pay drivers new backed family money unusual Stroll attracted far attention ill-feeling others. First speed seasons single-seaters crucially answer silenced critics  success track F1  lacking.

Michael Oliver brave observant send Ander Herrera spotted Manchester United players fouling Chelsea Eden Hazard rotational basis FA Cup quarter-final. The treatment Belgian brutal, Oliver sufficiently concerned hold lengthy discussion United captain, Chris Smalling, constant fouling Chelsea biggest threat. Play restarted Herrera, booking, brought Hazard again. It was worst foul isolation probably merit second yellow card. But enough. Herrera off. The problem, however, referees astute courageous Oliver kind cynicism eradicated good punishing person ultimately responsible. If referees identify believe premeditated campaign intimidation player, grant power sanction offending side manager? Nobody cares boring pub conversations controversial refereeing decisions. They reason push introduction technology prevent mistakes ruining games. This stake referees make errors: simply making sure level playing field possible. Human error inevitable. But unhealthy anger avoided referees given support. Would really terrible play stopped couple minutes allow video referee alert officials pitch Alexis Snchez handball Hull? Arsenal gone win game anyway, Hull would left burning sense injustice full-time. More technology lower respect referees. It opposite effect. Manchester United versus Southampton Friday night?

Every official, just like player coach possibly journalists, mistakes season fewer others; governed helpful way others. The football authorities Saudi Arabia, course big enlightened government, reckon Mark Clattenberg Premier League referee succeeded attracting kingdom rear generation expert Saudi whistle-blowers. This, then, Clattenberg season Premier League like vote kind lifetime achievement award. Ander Herrera probably would endorse harsh sending suffered Burnley season, match Clattenberg dismissed Jos Mourinho protesting rejected penalty appeal, but, general, players appreciate way Clattenberg runs games. Madley showed prepared make big decisions (correctly) sent players Premier League debut 2013 shrink making big calls season either. Riyad Mahrez goal chalked (correctly) adjudged kicked ball twice penalty spot Manchester City. Other officials let offences past Madley admirably vigilant. He vigilant, mind you, Chelsea went Everton earlier season Samus Coleman escaped unpunished ugly tackle Diego Costa. In April Madley criticised sending Oumar Niasse Watford decision later overturned appeal, unjust undermining referee decision time perfectly understandable. The 46-year-old standing takes charge international Champions League matches domestic duties usually goes work non-intrusive way possible. He particularly reluctant red cards, player really oafish dismissed Atkinson. The player sent  guessed  Marouane Fellaini. Arsenal fans complain Atkinson tad laissez-faire times, notably assistants failed spot couple significant offsides Manchester City beat Arsenal 2-1 season, but, overall, Atkinson does feature prominently fans bad books. He took charge matches Premier League official season, including high-profile European games. He memorably sent Burnley Jeff Hendrick bad foul Watford minutes, showing righteous contempt silly popular notion player let early offences. He truck notion Laurent Koscielny got dangerously reckless Everton 14 minutes final day season. Oliver sent Yaya Tour half Manchester City draw Liverpool Etihad referee contentious displays season got far decisions right wrong. Cricket statistics come caveats attached. According Wisden, Don Bradman 95.14 highest batting average first-class cricket. But, small print says, scored 10,000 runs. And little asterisk hides lot. Like this, story man better average Bradman, history first-class cricket, man list caveat. In little town Hay, close Murrumbidgee River, thing agreed Norman Callaway play. Hay 40 years old then, fine cricketers time  men like dashing all-rounder Happy Jack' Dillon Frank Darchy, local Justice Peace. Tom Callaway good bat boy, Norman, going better lot them. He 12 time turned Waradgery CC. They men short sent No7. He hardly lay bat ball early matches noticed fielding local paper wrote magnificent, splendid catches square-leg. Norman swam sprinted fast cricket thing. His father taught play straight, Norman soon learned hold end up. He Waradgery big game town derby Hay, save draw. Then batting boys age, again. When Public School played Convent October 1910, Norman creamed 117 innings 64 second. The paper called Trumper school Victor Trumper, 1910 boy hero. That season Trumper took 159 214 South Africans, back-to-back Test matches. Before long left Tom teach son. When Waradgery played Hay November, Tom duck, team 24 Norman came in. Young Callaway, said local paper proceeded grandfathers  suck eggs  play Hay bowling. He 32, score team 117. He going the best Hay produced, town knickerbocker champion. The Callaways four-room house Hatty Street, garden dahlias brood leghorn chickens. Tom owned soap factory, comfortable enough. But 1912, year Norman scored 259 runs innings took 15 wickets leg-spin too, year changed. In May Emily Callaway gave birth child, boy called Ernest. Three days later died acute bronchitis. In grief Callaways decided sell city. They auctioned house, factory furniture late November long journey Sydney. Callaway family, said paper, succumbed attractions the big smoke'. City life suited Norman just fine. He joined Paddington Cricket Club played way second grade. He finished season averages, 80 seven innings, caught eye great Alec Bannerman, doyen local coaches, man Wisden itself said would remembered long cricket played. Bannerman picked Callaway train New South Wales Colts point talking papers. A fair bowler good batsman, Bannerman verdict, worthy inclusion XI. First grade leap 17-year-old. Norman debut Trumper club, Gordon. Paddington skipper Monty Noble sent Callaway No3 41, score team 213. He played neat correct cricket, said Sydney Morning Herald, innings well worthy special mention. Norman followed 26 University, score draw tricky pitch. These performances news Hay, Riverine Grazier ran proud told so stories hometown boy batting big-city cricket. Soon Sydneysiders cottoned too. On 18 October Norman hit 137 Middle Harbour sudden, talking country kid, lately Hay. A splendid innings, said Herald, he batted brilliantly, agreed The Sunday Times. Callaway 5ft 7in a wonderfully developed lad, great power splendid physique, strongly built years. He played straight, just like Tom taught him, keeping left elbow forward, easy confident leg glance, crisp, strong drive showed splendid judgement selecting right ball jump punish. Norman finished season average just 50, earned call-up NSW Colts. At MCG tore Victoria, hitting 129 hours batting. He is, said Sydney Sun, one promising colts seen time. That winter Callaways moved house Ebley Street Norman switched clubs. He playing Waverley now, himself middle order alongside bright young prospect, Alan Kippax. They batted side-by-side season, taking turns averages. When slot opened NSW team, Callaway got it, Kippax. This inter-state game Queensland SCG, first-class match season. It started Friday, 19 February 1915, beautiful, sunny day Sydney. Queensland won toss, chose bat. Which mistake. They collapsed 137 out, routed New South Wales' quicks, Lyall Wall Will Cullen. But Queensland fine fast bowlers own. John McLaren, played Test cricket, Charles Barstow Sidney Redgrave, represented Australia XIs tour games, John McAndrew, future. And McAndrew, tall, left-arm quick, running red-hot. He clean-bowled men spell, just runs, NSW 17 three. Around 4pm, then, Norman Callaway walked SCG, 18-year-old first-class debut. And started thing Hay said could. From ball, said Herald, he swung bat great power precision striking distance. Norman 20 10 minutes crease. Soon partner, Frank Farrar, caught behind, score 58 four. In came NSW captain, Governor-General' himself, Charlie Macartney. Macartney dropped slip, ball. It was, Herald said, the turning point game. NSW scored 178 runs stumps, losing wicket. And strange story biffing banging little man might, said The Referee, but colt making appearance first-class cricket. Callaway cut hard past point, came pitch hit whizzing off-drives past mid-off cover. Soon the ball hummed parts field extraordinary pace. Macartney, great attacking bat, told boy You right ahead; I end up. Callaway 50 runs 67 minutes, went 50 100 half-hour. He brought ton a magnificent straight drive landed pickets far end. At stumps Hay knickerbocker champion 125 out. Macartney 57. Callaway display finest seen colt, said Herald. They compared great names old days, Massie, McLaren Noble. He develop best players Australia, agreed The Referee. On Saturday Macartney 103 Callaway eased past 150 200. He dropped deep point, mid-off, survived missed stumping too. Just lunch brought double hundred. He finally fell soon after, caught slip 207, half hours batting. And then, just like that, season ended. Queensland bowled 100, NSW bat again. And Norman played games Waverley, first-class cricket  just season followed, suspended world war. Trumper died June. If Australia, Sydney, lost great batsman, sure another. Though like range strokes Trumper, long, free-swinging drive beautiful follow-through reminder Nonpareil methods,, said Nyren' The Referee. He like late Victor Trumper invariably attacks bowling, agreed The Mirror, and like late, great cricketer, beautiful swing', bat generally describing parts circle finishing left shoulder. Now Norman Callaway 20, calling. Only cricketer day job clerk. On Tuesday 27 June, 1916, enlisted army. A friend remembered Norman wanted join artillery recruits take. Oh well, Norman said, I footsloggers. I ca hang weeks doing nothing. He lied age, added year would need parents' permission enlist. On 7 October 1916 Private Norman Callaway, 5794, embarked SS Ceramic sailed England. Norman Callaway went 3 May 1917, 100 years ago month, Bullecourt, Battle Arras. He came back. No knows exactly happened Private Alec Matthews said Callaway head blown shell soon started over. He fell me. I shocked time I thought taking disc paybook proof identity. Norman 21. His body found. He reported missing June, confirmed dead November. They lot good cricketers Hay, world war since. For long time, local boy started scoring runs, papers compare another, played like Trumper Public School, scored hundreds Sydney grade who, sunny days SCG, glorious double century hours class batting life allowed him.

The US-based owner was, usual, Emirates Stadium Sunday, himself vortex sourness seen protest banners including describing leech. His response reaction man Arsenal football veins, brief, two-sentence statement stock exchange. Even reaction final-day shakeout league table, Manchester City Liverpool claimed final qualification places Chelsea Arsenal keenest rivals, Tottenham Hotspur, season Champions League. Instead blunt somewhat insensitive clarification days leaking Friday news turned 1bn offer 67% shareholding Russian-Uzbek billionaire Alisher Usmanov, himself 30% stakeholder. The fact rare Kroenke public utterance, era-defining moment slippage Champions League, brisk matter money told story. That say corporate vehicle KSE [Kroenke Sports Enterprises] UK, shares Arsenal are not, been, sale odd uneasily phrased. The sentence, according Tim Payton Arsenal Supporters Trust, gave away: KSE committed, long-term investor Arsenal remain so. That self-description investor drove home frustrations supporters encapsulated leech banner. That said all, short statement, Payton said, he investor, involved club make money. The US commercialised sports, rich owners buy franchises closed leagues, aiming modern era values initial investments inflated TV broadcasting dollars, tickets, merchandising food bought fans stadiums. Arsenal supporters look Atlantic owners' franchises inspiration field, middling struggling performances recent seasons LA Rams NFL, Colorado Rapids MLS, Colorado Avalanche NHL Denver Nuggets NBA. English football century featured rough compromise rich men shares money needed, money presented custodians institutions clubs now. Arsenal acme culture, unusually upper class, generations shareholders making penny long successful tenures. It forgotten toxic stand-off Kroenke inert, absentee regime Usmanov  presenting himself fan corporate box spend big money players win things  came inheritors old Arsenal tradition cashed in. David Dein, vice-chairman football nous commonly said missed today corporate operation, began selling stake Usmanov 75m marched door, oddly, encouraging Kroenke buy club. The sitting Arsenal shareholders, led late Danny Fiszman, took Usmanov amid unease backstory decided sale Kroenke, American corporate sports franchise owner married Walmart family, preferable. Kroenke paid unholy fortune April 2011, 11,750 Arsenal share. Lady Nina Bracewell-Smith, inherited stake great grandfather-in-law, Sir Bracewell Smith, 116m.

Arsenal shares trading 18,000 Monday, despite beleaguered Arsne Wenger falling short Champions League qualification tortured air club. That 6,250 increase Kroenke share years, good return investor, supporters burning desire reclaim Premier League title won Wenger 13 years ago. People wondering Kroenke turn fine profit represented Usmanov offer, 565m gain 435m 67% calculated cost total, missing Kroenke sees. Even Champions League riches, football TV billions, attracted US investors buy Premier League clubs, upward trajectory. This year Premier League 8.4bn TV deals 2016-19. Uefa starts Champions Europa League cycle 2018-21 projecting similar uplifts. Interest appetite Premier League growing world elusive moment breaking America edging closer. Kroenke, ocean different time zone happy himself investor, long way away selling yet. Unquestionably Premier League dominant tactical trend three-man defence. A remarkable 17 20 sides started point season, Southampton, West Bromwich Burnley doggedly sticking four. Its overwhelming popularity largely influence Antonio Conte Chelsea. His decision switch three-man defence second half 3-0 defeat Arsenal September proved turning point arguably significant tactical decision Premier League history. Chelsea subsequent run 13 successive victories, conceding single goal, main reason title success. Chelsea flexible  times looked wing-backs defence, points midfield line, effective Victor Moses Marcos Alonso pushed forward aggressively effectively formed Pedro Rodrguez, Diego Costa Eden Hazard. Teams impossible cope overloaded, Chelsea wing-backs regularly popping unmarked far post convert opposition dragged opposite flank. Ronald Koeman Everton thrashed 5-0 Stamford Bridge attempting match Chelsea shape opponents faring better deploying wing-backs. Pep Guardiola unusual 3-2-4-1 beaten Chelsea Etihad Chelsea fought recorded 3-1 victory, important win campaign. Chelsea winning run ended January Spurs, played 3-4-3. By spring Arsne Wenger playing three-man defence time 20 years. Arsenal took inspiration Chelsea, changed place defeat Arsenal. Saturday FA Cup final 3-4-3 3-4-3, fitting summary domestic campaign. While bottom-half clubs remained focused dropping deep staying solid banks four, general trend bigger sides press aggressively advanced positions. Although relatively rare full-pitch press Premier League, midfield zones based regaining ball retaining it. Mauricio Pochettino Tottenham remained Premier League cohesive, efficient pressing side. With Jan Vertonghen Toby Alderweireld happy playing advanced defensive line, Victor Wanyama recruited ball-winning ability four, Tottenham defensively solid season, conceding 26 goals. Jrgen Klopp Liverpool press different manner, counter-pressing regain possession immediately ball lost. They excellent boxing teams flanks, shifting entire touchline. On regaining possession look spread play knock quick-passing combinations attack, occasionally worked excellently. A years ago, Barcelona Spain possession football revered, Premier League midfielders played calm roles, keeping shape using possession care. Now considerably frantic, based constant sprinting, closing blocking passing angles. The physical demands extraordinary notable Chelsea  like Leicester previous season  benefit European football. Quality possession taken backseat significant N'Golo Kante voted PFA player year. Ball-winning rarely vaunted. At stage Premier League course beat division record highest number goals game. In end fell narrowly short, finishing 2.80 goals game, 0.01 short record set 2011-12. But record broken largely irrelevant  main story average returned level years ago. Between 2009-10 2013-14 goals-per-game average highest rate, steady spell 2.77, 2.80, 2.81, 2.80 2.77. It dropped 2.57 2.70 seasons. This season rise underlines majority Premier League teams generally played positive football. Perhaps Middlesbrough, Sunderland Watford unduly negative  defended deep usually offered sufficient counterattacking threat too. The high goals-per-game ratio reflection inequality division. The 15-point gap seventh-placed Everton eighth-placed Southampton notable significant fact seven recorded goal-difference figures +18 more, managed -7 less. The final day season, sides defeated sides aggregate scoreline 20-2, underlined disparity and, high goals-per-game rate usually celebrated good thing, worth considering numbers detail. Often simply sign inequality, Premier League marketed itself league beat anyone. Petra Kvitova set play Wimbledon seven months stabbed intruder home.

Jens Steffensen, Denmark international Dolberg agent years, recalls: After day trial, said me: We want sign him.' We went inside phone Kasper parents discuss  did long decide Ajax long history Danish players coming system; chose them. It good match. His personal trainer Dennis Bergkamp. Little years on, Ajax technical director proven right. Dolberg, 19-year-old powerfully built forward Silkeborg, excelled Peter Bosz thrilling young side, scoring 16 goals Eredivisie starts Europa League.

Within years I want scorer Premier League I want known world-class striker, Nicklas Bendtner, plays Norway Rosenborg, told Guardian years ago. And happen. Trust me, happen. There appears little chance Dolberg making mistakes Arsenal striker. In interview Danish national broadcasters DR October, softly spoken teenager said preference to remain background  trait father believes son inherited him. He come indifferent, nonchalant cold deceptive, Rasmussen said. When pitch facing competition think, deep down, better opponent. Steffensen says: Kasper quiet person feet metre ground. It important connection earth. After Dolberg debut Silkeborg May 2015 starred Denmark Under-19s, Wolfsburg contacted Steffensen summer arranged attend trial. John Steen Olsen, Ajax celebrated Scandinavian scout long list discoveries includes Jan Molby, Zlatan Ibrahimovic Christian Eriksen, spotted asked agent make hasty decisions. It prospect working Bergkamp, entrusted bringing young players first-team squad, persuasive argument. Danish players mentality Dutch people, Steffensen says. You count fact team players good technical ability young. But domestic competition strong countries need right place step level. When Kasper came Ajax left winger. But Marc Overmars told thought fantastic No9. He Bergkamp Kasper seen results since. Ajax paid 270,000 sign Dolberg but, first, progress steady spectacular. After promising appearances Uefa Youth League, invited summer pre-season training camp Turkey Bosz forced way first-team reckoning, signing five-year contract senior debut. We knew level  quickly surprise us, Steffensen says. In years really started develop physically I think strongest assets now. He calm; believes himself. Kasper natural instinct going forward selfish player. The cushioned backheel pass path Davy Klaassen away leg last-16 tie Copenhagen March illustrated that. Bergkamp encouraging Dolberg shoot recent months, influence man remains Premier League all-time list assists clear see. At end second leg Lyon average age Ajax 20.

It really fantastic job doing, Steffensen says. They young players chance come team. Of course, level Holland like England good level football. It important given chance, matches long period time, proper chance adapt. Dolberg, renting flat Amsterdam staying host family year Netherlands, remains close parents. They touch regularly recent weeks speculation future spirals, assertion week stay summer music ears Overmars co. We Europe, especially England, Steffensen says. All clubs England touch  Spain well. Everything depends Ajax. He contract 2021 I do know want do. They given indication cost buy him. Anything north 30m, latest speculation believed. Manchester City scouting Dolberg season appear keen. Steffensen earn penny transfer. He says exclusive contract represent Dolberg, expires summer, Dutch agents SEG International ready step in. With player competition agents actually game, Steffensen says. I I young player I got team 17-year-old, I know works. If Kasper decides stay Scandinavian Soccer decides big agency wish best world. We way go. He kept focused way, deserves success. As Dolberg suffer nerves runs face Jos Mourinho United Stockholm Friends Arena, probably guess answer. No, no, no, Steffensen says. It like match.

In week plane New Zealand; general acknowledgment fortnight preparation time least. Gatland knows better late it. All conditioning staff drag bruised Saracens cryotherapy chamber attempt fast-track recoveries. We trying cover eight-week pre-season weeks, having players did expect huge bonus us, said coach. Everyone spirits willing; hopefully bodies eventually follow. Sadly, though, Vunipola setback recalls premature injuries undermined Lions expedition New Zealand 2005; Lawrence Dallaglio Bay Plenty Rotorua Brian O'Driscoll Test Christchurch. Psychologically ripple effect significant cases, outcome series certainly remained same. The positive Vunipola exit taken place squad flown out. It tends harder stay coolly philosophical small New Zealand town, rain sluicing down, just lost local provincial team key Test totems sitting head bowed distraught lobby. The big No8 spared never-ending flight home too. And door closes, opens. Anyone watched Vunipola cousin Taulupe Faletau Bath games season aware Welsh No8 running form right time. CJ Stander Ross Moriarty backward step James Haskell come stampeding dressing room determined prove tour place. The mind slides Rob Howley horribly painful shoulder injury 1997 series-turning opportunity suddenly knocked Matt Dawson. On tour Lions ended winning series different captain  Alun Wyn Jones  replacement prop  Alex Corbisiero  leading way. Not unforeseen events unfortunate. Injuries, too, simply rugby: occupational hazard levels. At point, though, does attrition rate start outweigh attractiveness product? The Rugby Players' Association chose timely day announce membership rejection Premiership Rugby plans extend domestic season end June; point shaping sport future need accept player welfare just couple glib words routinely lobbed press release. The counter argument professional rugby union know financially unsustainable volume games reduced. But price modern, forward-thinking sport principal gladiators injured step ring torn increasingly demanding masters? Corbisiero prime running green pleasant acres County Kildare; instead promoting game American television audience. Maybe, long run, good news rugby. Right now, beautiful serenity Carton House estate, 2017 Lions need help get. Amid weekend excitement Leinster defeat 14-man Scarlets team Friday evening necessarily receive widespread attention merited. The Welsh region sharper smarter night calling senior Wales squad recognition James Davies, brother Jonathan, reason jump basis efforts Dublin. Interestingly Davies Jr equally conspicuous GB sevens team Rio Olympics summer; reckon sevens does prepare players top-level 15s reconsider. Should Scarlets surprise Munster Saturday Pro12 final, good bet brothers Davies played leading role. The Aviva Premiership final Twickenham Wasps Exeter Chiefs ingredients breathless classic, sides committed pouring forward opportunity. They doing well, though, improve try scored pitch Dan Norton Sunday World Series sevens final. England lost never-say-die Scotland Norton masterclass wrong-foot covering defenders worth checking web. Over you, Christian Wade. Welcome theguardian.com review 2016-17 Premier League season. Now campaign ended like help choose favourite goal, best referee best manager, winners total 10 categories. We nominated contenders just discussion going: like suggestions compile best final polls vote on. The polls published midday Wednesday 24 May, tell think. Thanks Say like Tony Pulis, knows set team set piece. In end West Bromwich Albion scored 16 times corners, conceded just four. The importance set pieces Baggies' success overstated: just teams scored fewer goals open play, Burnley have gone down. Chelsea fine example: talent dominate teams open play, Antonio Conte coaching Roman Abramovich millions taken score 11 conceded set pieces season  overall +2 set-piece goal differential  transformed scored 22 conceded seven; corners scored 13 conceded two. There aspects tactical preparation complicated incomprehensible avid fans, is rocket science. Yet Marco Silva rocketed obscurity popularity impact Hull that, laudable respects, included totally hapless defending corner kicks. No fewer 13 top-flight teams conceded 13 goals fewer set pieces season, tally Alan Pardew Crystal Palace reached end November. Watford deserve special mention here: conceded 202 corners, 16 led goals. In words, conceded 7.9% corners faced; next-worst sides  Southampton Hull  conceded considerably superior 5.7% end scale Chelsea conceded 1.3%, Spurs 1.5%, Arsenal 1.6% West Brom 1.9% (Jrgen Klopp Liverpool conceded unimpressive 5.3% 133 corners faced, letting corner goals let Arsenal, Spurs Chelsea combined). There ways judging manager, chairman uncertain seeking kind tiebreaker certainly make argument coach trusted corners right probably trusted all. The thing appeals it just great way start weekend, said Jeff Stelling, discussed Sky plans latest live football slot season began. I ca think better going pub, having beer able watch live football Friday night. It turned out, however, football fans think plenty better things doing, viewing figures disappointing, Stelling double act Rachel Riley attracted mixed reviews. Sky scheduled Friday night fixtures weeks season, dumped months, showed game end December left four-month gap broadcast crucial late-season matches: West Ham v Tottenham, home side victory effectively ended title chase, West Brom v Chelsea, visitors' coronation completed. What surely learned experiment footballing world needs guaranteed fallow day, opportunity football fans pretend care families. It time rethink law, repeatedly emphatically proven itself useless inconsistently applied anyway. A player booked removes shirt goal, removes shirt heads tunnel half time, matter torn bloodied needs new one, punishment. We footballers' torsos offensive do, justification inconsistency shirt sponsors demand retribution logos absent post-goal celebration pictures, law offensive unsporting action intended prevent. Curiously, players cautioned climbing advertising hoarding perimeter fence celebrate goal, probably bring advertiser gratefully-received additional publicity. Running crowd creates clear health safety problems right players discouraged doing it, season league champions manager regularly buries himself fans exuberant celebrations, close proximity view fourth official  precisely identical offence players punished week  cautioned result. The official Graham Poll complained showing yellow card goalscorer renders referee popular is, does deter players' actions. Otherwise stopped doing now. That years ago, does work. In Europe leagues seasons comfortably 300 cautions excessive goal celebrations, Roberto Firmino consistent offender seven. Poll suggested players fined instead, punishment certainly just ineffective way deterrent, raise bit cash charity something. Here simple guide winning free kicks: Step one: Win, intercept passed ball. Step two: Run ball touchline. Step three: Wait opponent come vaguely near you, necessity touchline, dead space stands lie ahead. If necessary, slow time catch up. Step four: Fall over. This method successful 95% time, players figured out, leading lot wasted time free-kicks wide positions. It is foolproof fool-reliant, fool question referee. The merest nudge, that, clearly contrived position possibly worthy free-kick; point act it. As alternative, special outsized goal-line-technology-indicating watches slightly modified provide mild electric shocks time cluelessly award particular kind set-piece, sort problem short order.

AFL umpires asked league officials consider impact centre bounce officials amid suggestions traditional practice contravening occupational health safety guidelines. AFL football operations general manager Simon Lethlean said collaborating umpires issue bouncing ball cases leading injury. We claim now, we certainly understood umpires' position, Lethlean told SEN radio. I suppose claim' strong word  asked look occupational health safety issues bounce, we got independent doctors doing alongside official physiotherapist umpires. Lethlean ruled immediate change rules concerning bounce said issue worthy investigation. There change bounce season, it certainly commission decision stage year there change not, Lethlean said. Just occupational health safety review does mean bounce go. It actually means ways mitigate prevent injuries, that case, way training methods, frequency, better medical research. The centre bounce understood strain umpires' backs shoulders, calls seek alternative method restarting play heard before. But taking bounce game proved difficult, conservative factions AFL keen uphold traditional elements game. It unusual unique facet game I think fantastic game, overwhelming evidence facts it removing umpires game, limiting umpires get, losing good decision-makers good umpires causing injuries, we got consider [changes], Lethlean said. We certainly we seriously. The AFL will, however, act immediately outlaw jumper punch end current season, following series recent incidents. It unusual, we going [change rules]. We do want punching continue, Lethlean said. We unequivocal that. I think change required. Clearly, deterrent fines stopping on-field punching various forms. That MRP [match review panel] equipment able classify forceful contact intent. We make really clear players clubs make change that enforceable gives MRP right equipment classifications ensure sanctions matches [suspension], compared fines, that going deterrent required. Eleni Glouftsis' journey female field umpire AFL history began notice high school bulletin Year 9. Glouftsis footy fanatic, playing years Adelaide High School saw AFL female pathway advertisement. At time South Australia was really great pathways women finished playing high school, tells Guardian Australia taking bow centre-stage Docklands. I really loved football involved fitness I gave really enjoyed it. In hindsight I definitely glad I kept umpiring. I'd love play AFLW, I just love involved elite level, I happy able form. Glouftsis' landmark call-up comes year Tracey Gaudry appointment female CEO AFL club, incredible success inaugural season AFLW. Glouftsis believes emergence women AFL speaks importance pathways available her. It really important terms progression game. We seen lot women involved past years. They gone ranks they ready elite positions now. The AFLW fantastic women involved aspects game, game Australia. Now women players hopefully women umpires elite level, hopefully women just capable men. Glouftsis officiate second match weekend, game Melbourne Gold Coast Alice Springs. Things have gone way, however, controversy ensuing decision  consultation umpires' boss Hayden Kennedy  throw ball bounce second half debut game Sunday. Glouftsis previously recall bounces  situation described really disappointing. I generally quite good bouncer, [but] turf re-laid week, number umpires lot trouble soft surface. Glouftsis aware conjecture difficulty bouncing gender issue, said paid attention it. We umpire tossing having issue. It gender issue, I hope I prove Alice Springs. Nonetheless, debate reignited calls review AFL traditional centre-bounce, coaches seemingly torn issue. After Sunday match, John Worsfold said happy scrap bounce, Adam Simpson critical decision umpires change bouncing throwing ball midway game. But Glouftsis said decisions common conditions changed match, rain. She hinted bounce outlived historical purpose. Obviously it really traditional game, I love unique aspects AFL. But number umpires shoulder reconstructions, umpire injury it. The way now, bounce predictable straight. It takes away purpose bounce, unpredictable. With way game changing, really makes think, is place bounce more?' With second outing week away, Glouftsis said time reflect people supported journey, including 91-year-old grandmother, trip Adelaide mother, father, brother sister, partner Dillon Tee, AFL (boundary) umpire. Glouftsis said Tee just purchased home Adelaide got Melbourne pursue umpiring career. It really challenging, Dillon great support. He said if does work, let just again'. At point, makes worth it. Glouftsis said hoped debut encourage women consider umpiring. If you passionate football, umpiring great way involved. It increases fitness, confidence, leadership; there skills learn football environment. It great way great game footy. LeBron James accused things lack confidence powers usually them. However, that team-mate JR Smith believes needs James scored just 11 points gave away turnovers Cleveland Cavaliers' shock defeat Boston Celtics Sunday night. James total lowest post-season career, time playoff games failed score 30 points. He got aggressive, downhill, play like he playing, play confident, Smith said. That I think, people stature people like him, you got play confident night play aggressive. It Eastern Conference finals. It him. For does, brings, it enough. He knows that. We know that. Just expect better Game 4. Cleveland lead Eastern Conference finals 2-1 expected win best-of-seven series, especially Celtics team best player, Isaiah Thomas. But James performance Sunday unusually passive  took just shots fourth quarter. On Monday, James stay extra work game practice, unusual. His coach, Tyronn Lue, insisted All-Star good spirits however. No blame. We blame, Lue said. We lost. It happens. For guy played great straight months, he got bad game sooner later. He human. He did shoot ball well. It was ordinary game. But Kevin [Love] Kyrie [Irving] going early played well, kind got rhythm little bit half. That excuse. They played well, we just got play better, physical. The Celtics, meanwhile, high coming 21 points win Game 3 0.01 seconds left. Game 4 Tuesday Cleveland Sunday win means Celtics play game home arena season. Game 5 Boston Thursday. Avery Bradley hero Celtics Sunday three-pointer sealed win. He said absence Thomas, miss rest playoffs hip injury, helped inspire team. You obviously hear people saying it respond, do feel like people believed counted out, Bradley said. But just chip shoulder, I think good. I hope continue play chip shoulder come way game. Bradley said Thomas was Cleveland keeping touch. We called FaceTime, got celebrate little bit, Bradley said. We wish us, just want better. Juan Mata believes Manchester United finally right manager Jos Mourinho, Spain international hopeful new era success kick-started winning Europa League. United face Ajax Wednesday final Stockholm. If Mourinho win claim second trophy season, following EFL Cup, qualifying Champions League season. United won Premier League Sir Alex Ferguson final season charge, 2012-13 campaign. David Moyes succeeded Ferguson sacked 34 league games successor, Louis van Gaal, removed seasons, win year FA Cup. Mata said: Mourinho hates lose. If manager player club, high demands. It does matter Sir Alex Ferguson just left, does matter size quality squad, asked reach top. The 29-year-old midfielder added: I confident deliver fans happy again. Hopefully start final Ajax Wednesday. We want play European football, hopefully Tuesday Wednesdays, instead Thursday, it Thursdays play Thursdays would excuse try win title. Obviously do time recovery should, lived season. But I think club money help try bigger squad help prepare different competition. Mata signed Moyes January 2014 club-record 37.1m. His contract expires 2018, club holding option extend season Mata indicated wants sign again. Yes, I happy here. I said I came greatest moment club history, Mata said. It different approach new stage Sir Alex Ferguson. We managers, different players coming going, I feel really happy club. I feel privileged play Manchester United. It I old I proud of. There 5,000 miles England India Ben Stokes, just IPL, Leeds world away Pune. He prepare England ODI South Africa Wednesday and, Yorkshire places earth aside India cricket fairly described, borrow Stokes' phrase, a religion, little solemn observance round Headingley way. It completely different England, says. They mad it. They queue hours just Dhoni walk pitch. It relief, says, able walk road coffee having pester selfie, selfie, selfie. While Stokes' English team-mates pottering county grounds playing alongside MS Dhoni Steve Smith Rising Pune Supergiant. They IPL final  lost Mumbai Indians single run Sunday  Stokes missed game. He, Chris Woakes Jos Buttler recalled IPL England training camp Spain, allowed skip one-day internationals Ireland. If traditionalists annoyed trio missed England matches, IPL fans just irked tournament final rounds. It pathetic, said Kevin Pietersen Sky Sports, an absolute shambles. Stokes, stuck middle, little diplomatic. Before tournament started clear us, me, Woakesy Jos, available 14 group games then, teams got finals, obviously Kolkata, Mumbai Pune managed do, were available that, said. So teams aware aware players well, thing going it. In Spain, said, England squad a lot fitness work, fielding work lot team-bonding stuff. Pune certainly missed him. The coach, Stephen Fleming, admitted game. Stokes, started IPL expensive player tournament sold 1.7m, finished named valuable. He scored 316 runs 12 matches, strike rate 143 average 32, took 12 wickets 26 runs each, economy rate 7.18. He won man-of-the-match awards, better measure influence, 18 RCB, 21 Mumbai 103 Gujarat Lions. As money, once thing started wipe carpet, says, and judge solely perform pitch. That pressure came myself, wanting performances team I playing for. If richer, happier famous player now, says better one. For time career able spend stretch time specialist T20 skills, instead fitting practice schedule one-day, Test championship games. Being able work hard skills weeks really good thing able do, Stokes says. Being able work specialist coaches Twenty20 cricket, I think bowling gone level. The main benefit all I think areas lot better tighter recently one-day cricket, came just working solely [the bowling coach] Eric Simons weeks I there. On got experience batting different situations different pressure so, says, all parts game got better. The curious thing IPL Stokes himself working Australia captain, Smith. I remember doing batting session power-hitting end guy I playing Ashes winter helping me, able fathom playing other. When got guys going play want winning ways going end working  IPL probably place that. Next ODIs South Africa, Champions Trophy. We earned right favourites, Stokes says. But we keeping feet firmly ground know competition best teams world beat anyone. The worry toll. And says hopes able play everything seasons, including IPL, does admit we just body copes everything. And conflicts schedule clear loyalties lie. Playing England, says, is main priority. Ben Stokes speaking behalf Royal London, sponsors one-day cricket Warren Gatland fears Lions lose 10 players injury month following Billy Vunipola withdrawal squad heading New Zealand. The head coach revealed asked England No8 come Ireland second medical opinion injured shoulder respecting Vunipola request pull tour. With squad fly Heathrow Monday, Gatland desperately hoping replacements required departure but, showpiece domestic finals negotiate London Dublin Saturday, entirely optimistic. No doubt couple week, said. We plan lose 10 players; that just attrition rate past tours. Any player gets injured time big loss squad spend lot time going process picking [specific] players. Vunipola conspicuous absentee long-standing shoulder issue, set operated July, aggravated inconvenient moments. I try persuade come assessed adamant was right, said Gatland. He big loss I fully respect decision he tour. He spoke family felt making right decision. I think pretty tough him. He ongoing shoulder problem months. We knew managed Saracens needed operation potentially going summer. It popping games you got respect decision. I was going push him. He got right mental frame mind  just on. More happily Gatland X-rays confirmed Ireland prop Jack McGrath bruised arm, compatriot Tadhg Furlong able train Monday. While Johnny Sexton, Sean O'Brien, Rhys Webb Ken Owens able light exercise squad temporary base outside Dublin, Lions coaches 30 players parade following semi-final wins Scarlets Exeter Leinster Saracens respectively. Being purely selfish pretty good results weekend, said Gatland. We gone 14 Wales week having 30 camp. We were really expecting number. The remaining members squad join Sunday, including Vunipola replacement, James Haskell. Gatland phoned Wasps forward check state fitness calling news selection. Haskell, unsurprisingly, extremely keen. He said: I carry bags needs be,' reported Gatland. That kind person is. It just rugby ability. It handle squad. Some people used No1 nations. On tour accept they No2. He great usa really positive addition. He experience touring playing New Zealand. That reasonably significant. Haskell, belatedly picked long-awaited Lions adventure thought passed by, remains gutted injured England team-mate fully intends make unexpected opportunity. It good just tour collecting kit, said Haskell, spoken Vunipola hours news latter withdrawal released. You want win given opportunities midweek games fight Test place. That you truly Lion, make Test sides. Haskell clear memories Super Rugby season spent Highlanders, based Dunedin. Of places visit, New Zealand toughest. Everywhere go, gives haka. They say they welcoming they offering outside fight, kids aged OAPs. They say it welcome looks like aggressive war dance me. Over live breathe rugby. That I living there. I loved it. It place rugby No1 priority. Another slice good news came shape Lions captain Sam Warburton says fully fit ready crack on New Zealand tour. Warburton played suffering knee injury early month, firmly course potentially lead Lions week tour opener Provincial Barbarians XV. I fully fit, good, said Warburton. Last week camp Wales I pretty doing apart just little bit contact stuff. But today I trained fully. We contact, I absolutely fine. That boxes ticked, I crack on. We day here, run pretty lineouts team stuff going. We fully-loaded. All boys pretty speed. We start building momentum. David Moyes saw high-point managerial career chosen succeed Sir Alex Ferguson Manchester United man himself. He imagined turning point, reputation built carefully unravel quickly. Since swapping comforts Everton six-year contract Old Trafford May 2013, departing Goodison Park standing ovation less, Moyes sacked clubs resigned suffered relegation career. It reflect 54-year-old left Sunderland compensation final years contract, reflects truly dismal spell Stadium Light clean break mere footnote Moyes time club. A Football Association charge threatening slap BBC Newcastle Radio Five Live reporter Vicki Sparks, wins 38 Premier League games pandering John Terry ego Chelsea final day season defining memories Sunderland support. Ten months United, year Real Sociedad 10 months Wearside: stability Moyes gave Everton  vice versa  exception career highest level when, United contract demonstrated, norm years ago. Change confined results Ferguson summonsed fellow Glaswegian home offered, no, bestowed Moyes job replacing legend, task appeared unsuited start. The Scot faced constant calls dismissal Sunderland supporters final months season delivered relegation club flirted years. It hurt Moyes hear demands head time set foot technical area but, tellingly, financial constraints believed resignation ahead season spent fighting Championship, external pressure. Moyes felt quit before, little money spend productive players Jordan Pickford Jermain Defoe destined leave summer, return Sunderland manager looked worse. Instead, however, decision strengthens suspicion Moyes lost fight, confidence clear convictions develop team long term walking dressing room champions United encountering open hostility. Moyes accused aloof arrogant 12 months Real Sociedad, criticism said prior chosen Ferguson, Fabio Borini admission Sunderland squad divided invited fresh questions man-management skills. A catalogue injuries timing Moyes arrival Sam Allardyce replacement summer contributed Sunderland problems season signings, tactics motivational woes equally significant. In respects resembled right fit Sunderland given achieved time, patience boardroom support Everton Ellis Short seventh manager years help himself talk relegation fight games season. What Moyes saw brutal honesty perceived unnecessary negativity, image proved impossible shake. A mid-season break New York preceded miserable run form turning host former, ageing Everton players improve Sunderland survival prospects added supporters' dismay. Moyes Sunderland manager discover transfer budget large appeared talks club hierarchy. Allardyce, feted dragging club safety landing England job, quickly took issue financial situation Sunderland allegedly thought 50% led believe. By getting Moyes feel opportunity start afresh long-term outlook suits elsewhere. But experiences United, Sociedad Sunderland risk. His options highest level suffered consequence season diminishing returns, Scotland job remains likely alternative Gordon Strachan time up. Time reflect downward trajectory career, rediscover drive ambition characterised arrival Premier League, order. Mitchell Pearce recalled NSW coach Laurie Daley day Billy Slater long storied career Queensland appears ended Queensland mentor Kevin Walters. Pearce, channelling cockroach NSW colloquially known as, thought black line ruled infamous pre-season scandal year given lifeline Blues coach smitten club form. The Roosters No7 beat incumbent Adam Reynolds tie Immortal Andrew Johns capped NSW half history. It redemption story steroids maddening disregard Einstein definition insanity, depending position. Pearce won just 15 Origin matches rep career started 2008. He played winning series. His statistics Blues make sorry reading: try, assists, 15 errors, just forced drop outs missed tackles (51) runs (49). It selection set state alight debate. No player divides NSW fans more. Those inclusion argue best half club-land available. Those point malodorous Origin record. Daley clearly does buy philosophy ignore history doomed repeat it. No doubt working Pearce favour partnership James Maloney, duo winning premiership Sydney Roosters 2013 years playing together. While Pearce inclusion set tongues wagging south border, exclusion left Queensland coach Kevin Walters tears state shock Billy Slater passed over. Slater played 27 times Maroons debuting scintillating 20-year-old 2004. Injury kept encounters strong  healthy  start season, Storm custodian expected return No1 jersey Darius Boyd shifting wing. Arguably greatest fullback history, Queensland long-standing policy loyalty got job previously overlooked decision that, barring injury Boyd, likely brought curtain Maroons' longest-serving popular players. It doubt changing-of-the-guard match Maroons. Johnathan Thurston likely miss match injury. Greg Inglis Matt Scott hurt Nate Myles join them. Corey Parker retired. Anthony Milford beat hot field partner Cooper Cronk halves Thurston chances playing diminished, field included Daly Cherry-Evans Cameron Munster. There doubt Milford explosiveness individual brilliance stylistically complements organised football-savant genius Cronk. It bold Walters likely pay dividends. The Maroons mentor happily faith debutant Dylan Napa start prop. The fiery Roosters red-head doubt targeted early aggressive Blues pack Napa player knows fear. Walters' counterpart Daley far conservative selections. Aside going Nathan Peats debut hooker, decision forced injury Peter Wallace belief incumbent Robbie Farah bad match Pearce, Daley stuck ageing team. Brett Morris has scored try weeks chosen wing. Josh Dugan picked position having played month. Jarryd Hayne unable rediscover pre-NFL form. Aaron Woods David Klemmer kept spots prop rotation despite Dragons pairing Paul Vaughan Jack De Belin Storm youngster Jordan McLean far better form. It conservatism likely cost Blues. Again. Daley consistently believed team lost narrowly verge winning following year rolls reluctant make changes. The greatest trickery Queensland played having NSW believe close ending Maroons' dominance. The packs look evenly matched. Both deep aggression work rate. The fullbacks team brilliant, different style matchwinners same. The Maroons maybe slightest edges three-quarter line, primarily centres  toughest defensive position field  actually centres. The tale halves though, Queensland dominated New South Wales decade clear advantage, debutant. Cooper Cronk relied kick players right spots. Milford role simple. Unfortunately Blues do Cooper Cronk. They do best available halves pairing. Kumar Sangakkara fell early final morning Surrey draw Middlesex, tempted wafting James Franklin, work done; baton picked young players  Ben Foakes Curran brothers, Sam Tom  games profoundly influenced, manoeuvred Surrey position Middlesex dare chase. The equation 242 runs 39 overs, settled draw. That Surrey escaped result largely Sangakkara. In game scored centuries, passed 20,000 first-class runs, just fourth Surrey player (after Tom Hayward 1906, Jack Hobbs 1920 1925, Ian Ward 2002) score Championship hundreds consecutive innings. He scored 234 runs match, greatest contribution Surrey batsman Foakes 86. Nobody, Gary Ballance, 592 runs Championship cricket summer. Sangakkara confirmed close case catch can: final summer county game and, week portrait unveiled pavilion, red-ball game Lord. It nice bat Lord, said. It probably time I play four-day game here. The biggest mistake make think better try fight inevitable. You need ahead. All good things come end. Cricketers sportsperson expiry date. I did imagine week end way, no. It great privilege honour I think Anthony, artist, actually look bit better I actually am. I sure I better Mahela [Jayawardene, painting Sangakkara], certainly better I real life! That plus point. The time I walked past picture Test cutouts  bit embarrassing unnerving, too! I basically memorabilia home time cricket, I big mementos. But Lord, it great privilege.

He told him, too, path prolonging career; just way reaching end season better shape reaching season season that. There point flying September October struggle finish line May, years. Ronaldo listened. That conversation looks like Zidane greatest success. I played seven, games fewer previous seasons showed end: managed intelligently, Ronaldo said. In fact, 11. These games things decided in, added, goals decided them. He scored 40 season, 14 40 days. At Rosaleda, got goal took Madrid title resisted and, it, left one step making history. All coach just beginning. Four years ago, Zidane admitted did know make good manager wanted out. He'd hanging about, doing particular; wanted real. So prepared  properly. Others convinced, including club, increasingly was. On day presented asked counted success. Winning everything, said. It implausible day, turns right. After months won European Cup, won league  success feels like Milan did, doubts surrounded decreasing day. It long hard said, satisfaction lay precisely  work, leadership, sense responsibility. I live I doing passion, Zidane said. After nine, 10 months, win league years later  pfff  words. When Real Madrid know expectations high I like that. I lived player happiest day coach changes completely. Madrid won league, last. What now, Zidane asked. After all, European Cup final come too. Sitting soaked champagne, bus waiting outside airport Madrid, land 2am crowd gathering game ended, sure wait over, Zidane smiled. Now? Now, we going celebrate, said. We Cibeles people people team.  There tears final day; Fernando Torres too. The Kid, longer kid, scored twice opening 10 minutes Atltico Madrid match Vicente Caldern. Nostalgia took hold, club title winners brought giant team photo, banners round stadium recalling men moments marked place 50 years, feelings too, huge mosaic declared: How I love you. They walked Melancholics' Way time, appropriate  long appropriate. It mess, falling down, home. Now they moving A Stadium Called Wanda, right city, world, things again. There hope quite good, though.

Welcome theguardian.com review 2016-17 Premier League season. Now campaign ended like help choose favourite goal, best referee best manager, winners total 10 categories. We nominated contenders just discussion going: like suggestions compile best final polls vote on. The polls published midday Wednesday 24 May, tell think. Thanks Loud laughter greeted announcement Chelsea re-sign David Luiz Paris Saint-Germain sum estimated region 34m summer. With benefit season worth hindsight, contrarian critics argue likeable Brazilian bargain. A defensive rock natural leader rarely foot wrong Chelsea imperious title-winning campaign, David Luiz forever tainted semi-final humiliation 2014 World Cup, evening entire Brazil team collective meltdown singling individual ridicule unfair. With distinctive hairstyle, tends stand makes mistakes, allowing detractors press box, TV studios stadium stands pounce increasingly rare occasions gets things wrong. Their silence season spoken volumes. Nevertheless, despite available evidence contrary, cling defeat Germany efforts argue 30-year-old joke. While prepares final assault fifth major honour short spells Chelsea player, ca help wonder who laughing now? Even leg, continues amaze. While it advisable Mino Raiola says shovel-full salt, garrulous agent assertion surgeons impressed client Zlatan Ibrahimovic injured knee like use research purposes brought wry smile wondered 35-year-old struggle make impression playing Premier League time. A free transfer, albeit rumoured trousering 367,640 week certainly got hefty signing fee himself representative, Ibrahimovic scored 28 goals 46 appearances competitions Manchester United  fairly astonishing feat considers Marcus Rashford United prolific scorer season 11. Ibrahimovic assists speculate contributed cause season had curtailed injury playing Manchester United team managed somebody risk-averse ridiculously negative Jos Mourinho. Without input, Manchester United little chance matching year finishing position sixth time around. Get soon, big fella. A target Arsenal Manchester United days 21-year-old Celtic, clubs rue letting Southampton jump sign bargain 12.5m moving Spurs less. Reunited manager Mauricio Pochettino, Kenyan consistently outstanding Tottenham midfield, embracing aspects grunt work prompted manager label the perfect player. Energetic? Tick. Aggressive? Tick. A voracious devourer loose balls impressive passing range? Tickety-tick tick tick. Still 25, Wanyama scope improvement appears willing learner. He curbed enthusiasm earned red cards season, replacing goals instead. Ably assisted marauding full-backs Kyle Walker Danny Rose, Christian Eriksen Dele Alli provide stardust Tottenham midfield, creative freedom Wanyama Mousa Dembl provide instrumental making Pochettino exciting Premier League. With searing pace short distances, close control ability stretch opposing defences, Sadio Man proved inspired signing Liverpool arrival Southampton 34m. Far taking time settle new surroundings, mesmerising intervention ensured took points opening weekend white-knuckle ride Arsenal chipped 12 Premier League goals since, despite missing sizeable chunks season Africa Cup Nations duty Senegal and, recently, injury. Indeed, ability wreak havoc defensive lines rival teams, argued Liverpool little over-reliant Senegalese speed-merchant.

Russia told early September implement range anti-doping reforms very difficult athletes compete 2018 PyeongChang Winter Paralympics.

To decide walk-off minute 26 Chelsea final Premier League game, guard honour team-mates applause Sunderland, fitting way close 19 stellar years club massive misjudgment involved. The result: unedifying episode rated cloying overly sentimental. Terry chief culprit here. The view match meant Chelsea champions Sunderland relegated wrong. There fundamental riding game professional (or amateur) sporting event: integrity competition. At stake Sunday Stamford Bridge global millions tuning Premier League sovereignty. What matters that, context, match England flight competed honestly. Instead, Terry final home outing personal testimonial. Instead, previously faultless Antonio Conte error regret. By agreeing Terry-related stunt manager allowed superb team overshadowed 112-year-old institution Chelsea reduced walk JT Show. The roll puppets wide-ranging. These include Sunderland AFC, 138-year history includes agreeing boot ball Terry-appropriate time; David Moyes, manager follow-up act guiding Black Cats relegation place bending opponent watched travelling fans surely sick spectacle; Diego Costa Jordan Pickford, co-opted striker demanded goalkeeper ball out. Throw in, too, forced guard honour Premier League executive questions answer. This farce repeated. Jamie Jackson So John Terry ends Chelsea playing career, 700 games (mostly captain), 67 goals shoal trophies. The ultimate one-club loyalist. In 50 years I watched Chelsea comparable club figure terms duration captaincy number appearances Ron Harris, played 795 games 1960s 1970s captained decade. Harris remains, day, visibly proud played club truly iconic figure supporters generation. It hard younger Chelsea supporters today having respect Terry decades. There arguably better Chelsea footballers  Osgood, Cooke, Zola, Hazard starters  apart Harris probably epitomises love club, loyalty never-say-die spirit supporters want see. To outsiders Terry Marmite figure Chelsea supporters truly iconic man, tower strength club long, winner. To captain team success, shows extraordinary strength character. He captained teams strong personalities unquestioned leader. Even autumn Chelsea career totally supportive Antonio Conte. There whingeing media, sulking. He leaves head held high. The 26th-minute tribute Terry seems, reasons I fail comprehend, upset unholy alliance moralists, social media bedwetters bandwagon jumpers. It happened generation ago honest really cup tea. However hurt nobody, took little time, affect match way, Sunderland fans upset 40,000 Chelsea supporters clearly appreciated it. Frankly, football bigger things worry about. The Premier League trophy presentation ceremony ludicrously overblown and, going did, meant focus final whistle team, JT.

Humiliating sound like extreme word Paris Saint-Germain season 10 months verged disastrous club. This time year strolled fourth title row, finishing 31 points clear Lyon Monaco won second consecutive French treble. It easy, time, stagnated season. And now, Monaco surpassing Ligue 1 premier side, club identity called question. Since QSI takeover 2011, Paris Saint-Germain focus thing: Europe. Winning Champions League continent elite sides reason club purchased. With overwhelming pool resources, domestic dominance assured sooner later, Europe obsession. Laurent Blanc dispensed summer despite clean sweep French honours, lacklustre exit Champions League. After winning trio Europa League titles Sevilla, Unai Emery enlisted bring PSG success abroad maintain home. However, despite 125m invested playing staff swathes quality situ, season proven regression project question. It worth noting hugely successful season French football whole. A pair European semi-finalists irresistible Monaco freewheeling flaky Lyon France second represented nation semi-final stage. It validated notion talent nurtured Ligue 1 clubs realise potential challenge Europe long period underachievement. Monaco glorious championship win Nice strong title challenge Ligue 1 compelling, aided latest onslaught exciting breakthrough talent, Monaco phenomenal Kylian Mbapp head. In contrast recent years, profile French football enhanced spite Paris Saint-Germain them. Serious psychological failings biggest European matches evident Blanc exposed disastrous effect season, obviously Barcelona, ensuring summer crucial uncertainty. The rest league gained substantial ground Paris Saint-Germain danger stale. An overhaul desperately needed policy throwing money marquee signings needs scrapped. Monaco proved effective, compelling successful football achieved intelligent scouting, considered squad building investing young talent. Granted, Monaco billionaire owner, operating budget roughly PSG squad contains players carefully developed academy plus pinpointed having potential France afield. Paris Saint-Germain quasi-galctico ethos given squad lacking heart, mental fortitude and, whole, real emotional investment club. The signing ngel Di Mara seasons ago exemplifies problem. Di Mara, potentially world class player won Champions League, like natural signing deterioration form and, seemingly, attitude Manchester United mercenary, gun hire, hoping escape England, motivation signing Paris Saint-Germain questionable best. Of course, large percentage footballers  people  money but, successful highest level, desire usually fed just financial gain. Di Mara magical times but, genuine pressure points anonymous, petulant cowering. His childish sending Nice month just recent example. Paris Saint-Germain appears mean little colleagues. Marco Verratti progression used blueprint Paris Saint-Germain future dealings. A hugely talented player great potential, signed club young age given chance develop embed himself city team. Paris home clear ferocious play, passion leadership Paris Saint-Germain means him. His win extends desire contract. Clubs win Champions League boast core players ingrained club developed emotional bond bought. Engendering connection takes time. But time appears thing QSI willing invest. Monaco bought Russian oligarch Dmitry Rybolovlev soon QSI arrival and, briefly flirting policy big spending, forced change direction proven blessing. They built team carefully. Young players allowed grow past years develop effective, passionate group. They outperformed Paris Saint-Germain best result Champions League QSI stole league title playing kind exuberant, fearless football Paris Saint-Germain owners craved. Paris Saint-Germain currently like spoilt child showered gifts; want but, like toddler, achieving little. The club used academy recent years, Emery trying rectify. Faith placed Adrien Rabiot, academy graduates midfielder Christopher Nkunku, goalkeeper Alphonse Areola defender Presnel Kimpembe given responsibility season, particular showing qualities. In previous years sent loan given just handful minutes. The leadership changing. Sporting Director Olivier Ltang left month Patrick Kluivert position Director Football threat  club toyed idea hiring Monchi, man responsible Sevilla superb player recruitment recent years, eventually joined Roma. They rebuffed efforts recruit Atltico Madrid Technical Director Andrea Berta. Kluivert bizarre signing QSI era, counting lot lack credentials little. The fact recognise new signing Thomas Meunier, just played Belgium Euro 2016, PSG summer tour year says everything. Paris Saint-Germain finished Ligue 1 campaign 87 points probably win domestic cups little treading water. The nuanced way new champions handled squad PSG philosophy appear ignorant shallow comparison. This summer crucial project. The lack progress started breed uncertainty. Verratti, club prized asset, seen enough. He reportedly tempted Juventus, Barcelona others. He does want leave Paris continue develop  regard. Pivotal decisions need made: position manager, long-term role ageing captain Thiago Silva, oversee recruitment, highlight just handful. Paris Saint-Germain achieved significant Ligue 1 years reached ceiling  hitting heads time. If radically change tact soon, ceiling turn peak. French football changing; need up.  Bordeaux keen eye French cup final weekend. Having finished sixth league, need Paris Saint-Germain beat Angers guarantee passage Europa League. Paris Saint-Germain lost cup match 2014 Coupe France, Bordeaux feeling confident. Marseille worries, finishing fifth. Given club bigger aims, qualifying round Europa League like poor return, fifth place easy obtain; finished season 11-match unbeaten run, included 4-0 thrashing Saint-tienne home win in-form Nice. There mediocre draws Lille, Toulouse Nancy run, given 12th place November, fifth just reward maturing side. It shows improvement season allows Marseille offer carrot European football season potential recruits, vital look restructure team summer.  Nicolas Preville hat-trick Nantes hardly stuff dreams  penalty goals open play visitors' defensive miscues De Preville ability  goals took 14 season, impressive total considering goal scored Week 15. De Preville does really set position  he quite striker, winger, attacking midfielder  Franck Passi starting him. De Preville faced similar issues season Reims, took creative role variety misfiring strikers, given better platform north, sparkled. His future, age 26, doubt Lille embark youth-oriented transfer strategy, given vital goals avoiding relegation, club foolish buy player outright initial loan Belgian Oostende, club owned Lille previous shareholders, Mark Coucke, allowed Lille bypass scrutiny French football financial watchdog summer.  The battle avoid relegation Ligue 1 lacked sizzle Ligue 2 promotion race, flurry late goals shuffling Lens Troyes automatic promotion, bit late drama. Caen trailing 1-0 Paris Saint-Germain going stoppage time sitting play-off place goal difference Ronny Rodelin turned Maxwell prod home Jonathan Delaplace cross, match finishing 1-1. Caen probably talent beat Troyes, third-placed team Ligue 2, saved potentially awkward pair matches. Rodelin goal measure personal redemption dropped twice recent matches missed penalty earlier match. The lanky attacker quite impressive season, Ivan Santini team focal point, class ability key, making permanent Lille summer worth penny.  Alexandre Lacazette called time Lyon career fine fashion Nice, scoring brace 100 goals league. Lyon draw, weakened Nice, though, match painful microcosm season. Lyon attack, particularly Lacazette, impressive, seal victory defensive errors Nicolas N'Koulou (a poor backpass wayward arm leading penalty) led dropping points. With team-mates consistently undoing good work, wonder Lacazette boyhood club. Linked always-solid Atltico Madrid, Lacazette good servant Lyon years, 26th birthday week, prime deserves chance play defensive organisation make efforts worthwhile. Angers 2-0 Montpellier, Guingamp 1-0 Metz, Lille 3-0 Nantes, Lorient 1-1 Bordeaux, Lyon 3-3 Nice, Marseille 1-0 Bastia, Nancy 3-1 Saint-tienne, Paris Saint-Germain 1-1 Caen, Rennes 2-3 Monaco, Toulouse 0-0 Dijon.

Thanks Everyone loves seven-goal thriller football fans long wait Premier League season, Arsenal Liverpool dishing goods epic. As customary affairs, Jrgen Klopp uncoupled spectacles pessimistic Arsenal supporters left Emirates little idea exactly justified sense foreboding season ahead turn out. Having first-half penalty saved Simon Mignolet, Theo Walcott quickly atoned shot corner Arsenal ahead time lead. Philippe Coutinho equalised majestic free-kick moments break, prompting spell early second-half dominance Liverpool attacked opponents intensity angry swarm bees. Adam Lallana Coutinho gave Liverpool two-goal cushion, new signing Sadio Man introduced himself fine, decisive solo effort topped better Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain. A Calum Chambers header left Liverpool hanging deny old Arsenal opening day win fifth time years. Who saw coming? Having served best matches season, unlikely sequel gripping tale cities appeared December. For justified talk clever is, arrogance, ignorance combination meant Pep Guardiola chose ignore energetic, direct manner Leicester romped unlikely title win time team duly demolished exhibition counter-attacking excellence Jamie Vardy ended run 16 matches scoring champions emphatic style. The England striker hat-trick Andy King league goal season shell-shocked visitors, replied late goals Aleksandar Kolarov Nolito ultimately real answers. Despite abysmal defending, Guardiola absolved players blame shock defeat right minds predicted. Leicester won previous league games prevail 10 dire defence crown. This poor run form ultimately cost Claudio Ranieri job, characteristically dignified exit viewed extremely poorly handled, team hark year glory days. On day Chelsea cemented title-winning credentials eighth consecutive league win, Fernandinho Sergio Agero sent end simmering contest eventually boiled knockings. City myriad defensive shortcomings ruthlessly exposed Chelsea, won courtesy goals Diego Costa, Willian Eden Hazard Gary Cahill prodded net stroke half-time.

Fernandinho joined Agero referee Anthony Taylor bad books, getting marching orders attempt throttle Cesc Fbregas. It second red card games followed Burnley matches later.

With Liverpool complete control, Sadio Man Divock Origi looked game half-time Eddie Howe decision introduce Ryan Fraser 55th minute proved inspired. The Scottish midfielder immediately won penalty converted Callum Wilson, hopes comeback looked short-lived Emre Can restored Liverpool two-goal lead fine curling effort distance.

It nice story, it pity we wrong side, mused Jrgen Klopp post-match interview, feeling address Liverpool players quite measured. While Alan Pardew cling job Crystal Palace manager month, astonishing Swansea win left dead man walking.

Both boats water days urgent repairs carried amid acrimony. A tweet British team confirmed that: During pre-start, @LandRoverBAR bore away @EmiratesTeamNZ clipped hull, sustaining limited damage bow. Blair Tuke, Olympic sailing champion, New Zealand crew, responded biting tweet: Just clipped reckon?! Peter Burling, New Zealand helmsman, said angrily Ainslie: He ran straight us. It unnecessary. Ainslie tried make light incident Twitter. Bit love tap racing hard @EmiratesTeamNZ. Sorry guys hope you water soon. #AmericasCup. It mistake, Ainslie admitted, explaining trying force boat gap. He sound contrite. If you pushing, it racing. There clear sense Ainslie switching race mode. If asked teams, says, they'd want time make technical improvements point you got draw line sand competition. It closing fast. Ainslie won Olympic gold medals, silver, Games stretching Atlanta 1996 London 2012 dreamt lifting America Cup team. He carved chunk personal history oldest team competition world sport inspired incredible comeback America Cup 2013. Team Oracle, boat representing United States, 4-1 New Zealand asked Ainslie come board tactician. It totally new role took time adjust. When Oracle 8-1 plight hopeless. Team New Zealand needed win seal America Cup. Ainslie galvanised Team Oracle voice dominant. Race race, win win, gap closed arcane competition brought vivid life. Intimate broadcasting racing real Ainslie heard bossing skipper, Jimmy Spithill: Yeah, yeah, just sail boat, Jimmy! Once teams locked 8-8, final race formality Oracle built unstoppable momentum. It thrilling hear Ainslie exhort crew victory visceral of: This   work arses off! Has savoured achieved 2013? Not really, no. I trying new boat going it overpowering focus years. I proud Oracle team achieved opportunity start new team I could turn down. It incredible journey sight ultimate goal, bring America Cup Britain. The America Cup contested Isle Wight 1851 won British boat. The world greatest sailors locked competition 35th America Cup Japanese French lagging American, British, New Zealand Swedish entries. It America Cup complicated format. Ainslie team won America Cup World Series bonus points qualifying series Bermuda. The teams race twice, newly designed boats, progress challenger round. The winner face Team Oracle, racing preliminaries place final guaranteed defending champions, America Cup final mid- late June. About half team I sailed 2013 Oracle, Ainslie says champions skippered Spithill finished second World Series. But brought new people they strong position. After I field quite wide open. Artemis [the Swedish-backed boat] fantastic job. They strong  Team New Zealand. You count Kiwis they aggressive design philosophy, pushing boundaries what possible, fascinating. Traditionally boats use arm-operated grinders increase speed  Team New Zealand favour pedal power. Four cyclists NZ boat using legs produce extra wattage, arm grinders. Legs produce power bikes lack flexibility arm-grinders duck wind produce drag. We considered pedalling, Ainslie says, but decided efficiency issues, retaining durability feet knees risk unstable bike. Oracle got bike just reaction New Zealand. I assume they looking advantage defender. They use challenger series experiment do need results qualify. Land Rover BAR race Artemis led Iain Percy, Ainslie closest friend sailing. It interesting Artemis favourite team. We say if, unfortunately, were able win thing we'd love Artemis it. We lots friends and, particular, Iain. He fantastic job turning team difficult period 2013 favourites. Artemis won practice races Bermuda and, considering Ainslie searing competitive drive, relationship Percy distant just race? Oddly, ways it actually drawn closer. Sometimes, leadership positions, certain approach team. To close friend similar role helps. We quite phone sharing different ideas concerns. It opposite distant. When we water want win great thing Iain 30 years, racing other, we retained friendship. Their bond deepened loss close friend Andrew Bart Simpson, died training alongside Percy Artemis, Ainslie Oracle, just 2013 America Cup San Francisco. Percy said moved when, aftermath Oracle amazing victory, Ainslie stepped away celebrations share beer instead friend remember Simpson. Absolutely, Ainslie says, and remember day. It anniversary Tuesday [9 May] teams got Great Sound daybreak. We rafted alongside shared 15 minutes thinking Andrew. We great memories friendship impact sailing obviously terrible died. His wife, Leah, boys, Freddie Hamish, came Bermuda weeks ago. It absolutely fantastic Leah boys boats watch racing embraced friends. Is racing safer years ago? Yes. The game moved immeasurably safety element seriously. We thousand strain-gauges boats try make sure we pushing hard break something. We practise water dealing difficulties. A lot effort goes safe possible. Anticipation soon returns and, considering broadened appeal America Cup, Ainslie says: I compare World Series Cricket 1970s. They really revolutionised cricket filmed watched. That revolution taking place America Cup. The boats smaller faster we got cameras board, drone technology audio. So incredible spectacle closest America Cups history. It ingredients best-ever. Does gut instinct tell that, usually way Ainslie, way win? It big ask new team. We clearly foot practice racing lot performance upgrades come, sounds crazy days racing that nature development competition. I confident we improve significantly. We absolutely pushing try win it. At time Ainslie stresses sustainability DNA. He adds: From outset it important 11th Hour Racing key sustainability partner. They instilled sense responsibility best drive sustainability. We got partnership Southampton University looking better recycle carbon key component hulls wings boats. Sporting victory consumes 40-year-old  does challenge sailing America Cup boat. I flown fighter jet I imagine it similar. There stressful periods I could prouder team way they risen challenges setbacks. Winning year goal started team managed win America Cup attempt.

Premiership Rugby drew plan March World Rugby announced changes global calendar mean domestic season Europe starts month later October goes end June May. The Pro12 board immediately agreed three-month off-season start league beginning October Premiership Rugby said begin campaign usual September extra month. The proposal discussed us, said Rugby Players' Association statement. The RPA sought work collaboratively Premiership Rugby address player welfare concerns. It caused significant concern disappointment members learn Premiership Rugby plans extend domestic season press release. Despite disappointment, Premiership Rugby invited present proposals RPA players' board Wednesday 10 May. However, consideration, board unanimously rejected proposals current form. The Premiership season longer comparable contact sports, including Super League, NFL AFL. Extending arduous season months implications players, given potential increase game, training psychological loads face.

It critical playing game say run look forward working game stakeholders issue ensure rugby union continues flourish England. Welcome theguardian.com review 2016-17 Premier League season. Now campaign ended like help choose favourite goal, best referee best manager, winners total 10 categories. We nominated contenders just discussion going: like suggestions compile best final polls vote on. The polls published midday Wednesday 24 May, tell think. Thanks Because turning widely-despised team finished 10th occasionally-despised team finished does place list there sense world. Spurs brilliantly entertaining, wonderfully organised excellently motivated team, missed silverware manager deserves enormous credit it. Their away record little humdrum, home phenomenal, drawing Liverpool Leicester beating league does begin L. For he best definitely best managers world, said Harry Kane, absence ankle injury draw-heavy period late Autumn probably decided title. Not just pitch pitch  he great man-manager. This particularly evident way shuffled full-backs seasons, remaining excellent form high spirits weeks Kyle Walker, transfer speculation starting swirl, unsettled. The way Hugo Lloris speaks  already best manager world  matters lot me. Our relationship goes football  revealing high regard held charges. But final word goes Pep Guardiola: 'I do think he best managers England, he best football managers world, said October. I enjoy watching Tottenham. Not [just] right now. Since year. I think he doing amazing job. The way play I like lot. After shambolic Hull time manager players, Burnley considered pre-season relegation favourites, Dyche led season merry mediocrity, earning particularly brilliant results home. Since end August, tables do really count, Burnley bounced happily 16th place ninth, 42-year absence England team Burnley players capped. As result this, Dyche named official Premier League manager year shortlist: manager years, employed club considered particularly moneyed glamorous, nominated divisional manager year awards them. He overlooked he croaky-voiced Englishman, Dyche appears really quite good. When Allardyce sacked England manager September humiliating self-aggrandising  really, hindsight, damning  pint-of-wine-drinking outing undercover reporters, likelihood appearing list appeared extremely remote. It unlikely when, having appointed just Christmas brief bring joy Crystal Palace disintegrating season, won games, sinking 19th table. Particularly given play final 10 fixtures. Then came match Middlesbrough, debut on-loan Liverpool defender Mamadou Sakho: games wins later, including victories Chelsea, Arsenal Liverpool, escape complete. Allardyce ends season 2m relegation-dodging bonus payout manager-of-the-season nomination efforts campaign  months spent feet  man eyebrow-raising eight-game hot streak. As Bournemouth played final moments 1-0 win West Brom September, fans started sing: Tony Pulis, trilled, your football shite. They point. This season Bournemouth West Brom represent different answers question, regarding smaller-club top-flight survival techniques. The bigger clubs got money, skill ability, Pulis said month. The smaller clubs league have got money buy skill ability, work hard organisation. That do. Be organised set up. The fruits Pulis labour evident set-pieces, division successful exponents, open play prosaic. Howe talks frequently hard work, teams play open game, benefit  madcap 6-3 defeat Everton, contributed conceding league goals season Hull Swansea  normally neutral. I studying Bournemouth I watching good team good organisation, Antonio Conte said Chelsea met Cherries Boxing Day. They try play good pressure. If continues way sure manager great team. Bournemouth struggled times season, particularly run draws, league defeats 3-0 FA Cup humbling Millwall turn year second week March, absolute ease avoided hint relegation expected difficult second season flight makes retrospect fine season Howe (as was, way, Pulis). After years League One doldrums dismal finish Nigel Adkins season hopes were high Chris Wilder appointed new manager May. The start season led believe relegation battle, sat table games. Well, wrong. Very wrong. The Blades started winning won lot. Up table climbed, playing attractive football. Wilder changed 3-5-2 formation long Antonio Conte Chelsea. Buoyed excellent support home away, roared title. Wilder rejuvenated Sheffield United style. Here season Championship. Do surprised Blades half table. Shorehamview In light having transfer embargo, having integrate loan signings free transfer players, having proven goalscorer squad, exceeded expectations. Manager Phil Parkinson calming influence team, needs prove he capable managing Championship level. The financial situation needs stabilised club sold wealthy credible owners. Martin This went expected realistically. I do begrudge Millwall victory play-off semi-finals. We looked tuckered legs did deserve disappointing second half season. But Paddy Madden, Josh Morris Ivan Toney outstanding scored goals worthy Premier League. Local legend Graham Alexander brought plenty positivity ability small squad. Josh Morris goals early season vital putting weeks, unexpected solidity shaky defence. I guessing we struggle hold Morris, Madden, window. But we small club tiny squad unglamorous struggling town. If offered half League One I'd happy. BB There terrific wins Fleetwood season, unfortunately could mattered Bradford play-off semi-finals, despite running close. To finish fourth shoestring budget shows miracle Uwe Rosler worked term. He definitely point prove poor managerial experiences Wigan Leeds. He surely offered improved contract season. We come close getting Championship, shame tear now. Ben Finishing job Wembley Millwall perfect end season, alas fell just short day. The season overall best long long time though. Stuart McCall, arguably club greatest player, returned revolutionised style play. While successful moving soporific style Phil Parkinson, underlying issue converting abundance chances create. That case Saturday too. McCall kept faith foundations team, Bantam legend, Greg Abbot, recruited astutely. I confident we right track good position August. Michael Brett A good campaign turned fantastic beat Bradford second consecutive play-off final. I watch Steve Morison smash home late winner. The hurt year 3-1 defeat Barnsley finally thing past. We great FA Cup run eliminated Premier League sides Den, including Leicester, champions England. The FA Cup hindered league form. If we'd knocked earlier on, I think we'd contention second automatic position place. We quite small, tight-knit group managed sneak play-offs final day. But beating Scunthorpe legs standing firm Bradford Wembley, deserve place Championship season. Neil Harris cracking job taking 2015. He club legend supporters him. He us. The board need tough Championship campaign. We successful season strong defence, going 14 hours conceding stage season. Lee Gregory Morison great partnership offensively score goals level right service. We desperate second tier I delighted Saturday! Dan Clarke The season overall success, despite final-day heartbreak Millwall nabbing play-off spot. Phil Brown playing attractive football keeping defensively sound season. A common problem season conceding silly late goals, notably Sheffield United. Had goal gone in, play-offs. This team willing survive brutal slog Championship season. Signings spine team vital. We need bring able willing centre-back partner Anton Ferdinand striker make promotion push. Alexander Gowing Having newly promoted start season, club learned lot year League One ultimately held own. The cup runs decent but, taken points teams went League Two year, finished higher eighth. We chairman manager appear trust taking club forwards. Hopefully buy stadium near future too. Jon With just defeat April, seriously pushing play-off place, ultimately left do. It different drawn seven games, I happy progress season. Keith Hill doing great job us. Consistency key Hill given time gradually better better. A play-off place near far season and, we making steady League One progress, dreams Championship football pipe variety. Scott This good solid season back-to-back promotions. We consolidated League One position comfortably. There possibility play-off place, fell away end season. Tenth good base promotion push season. The owners coherent vision club ambitious manager unwilling let club stand still. We kick season. Colin Favour We went season high expectations, ambitious chairman, insipid performances, bemusing managerial decisions overall poor consistency meant finished season little improvement season prior. I believe players use Peterborough stepping stone career. There huge lack cohesion camaraderie squad predominance season. This clear terraces performances, especially London Road, uninspiring affairs losing, playing cagey draw, recording unconvincing scrappy victory. We need invest experienced players drive passion succeed bring passion London Road lacked seasons. Attendances dropping people starting lose interest. One mediocre season I feel considered fully established League One club which, club reasonably recent Championship pedigree, good thing. Jack Toulson Woeful Christmas, considerably woeful Christmas. In fact good second half season leave quietly optimistic 2017/18. With respect Rotherham, Wigan Blackburn temporarily embarrassed big club coming waltz division. Calling time Karl Robinson time difference. The abject collapse Championship disappointing maybe understandable, dozen games League One meant time go. Robbie Nielsen got better set results performances basically players. Pikeman We supposed promoted according board, top budget finished 13th. And far worse. We lost footballing titans (no disrespect intended) Shrewsbury, Bury, Oldham, Northampton Oxford. We averaged crowds 6,000 27,000-seater stadium. All run ground Roland Duchtelet. Negative, boring football Russell Slade followed tactically inept performances Karl Robinson. The protests good though. Tom At start season, squad missed automatic promotion final day season decimated, taken mid-table safety. It feels anti-climatic though. If season 38 games long, like Premier League, we'd just missed play-offs. That badly faded end cast shadow stable season. Jon Witney season manager ca regarded failure, struggled players motivated key times, particularly end season. Erhun Oztumer, Turkish Messi, revelatory free transfer spectacular goals galore. But goals delivered Cypriot international Andreas Makris, player paid fee decade. Daniel Jones I'd taken finishing 15th start season, especially poor start. We looked like compete best teams league games, completely outclassed others. Highlights obviously include beating franchise 2-0 coming 3-0 beat Curzon Ashton FA Cup. But crashing FA Cup Sutton, finishing Milton Keynes scoring games leaves mixed emotions going year. Manager Neal Ardley given stability, having kept majority squad season added astute signings. The end season felt quite flat good patches form. Tom Elliott brilliant season Jake Reeves easily Championship player. We need hold players type ability. Callum Losing League Two-winning manager Chris Wilder key players summer big blow. New manager Rob Page unable replicate team spirit winning mentality side. We positive start results began unravel October November, really picked up, culminated Page dismissed early January. This pivotal time Justin Edinburgh managerial career. Recruitment absolutely key. If gets right, himself team level. If not, he gone Christmas reputation damaged, irrevocably perhaps, we fighting relegation again. Party Horse Thanks resurgence John Sheridan months season, we kept heads water again. He brought stability club, galvanising players. Losing just games 10 success. But overall it old story lack funds, players desire play unless past point rescue, generally atmosphere-free stadium. No doubt John Sheridan let October come early April save drop more. I predict 20th season, we lucky. Patrick McKiernan Having flirted relegation 2015-16 season, really disappointing backs-to-the-wall campaign year. It started badly Micky Mellon, jumped ship managed National League Tranmere rock bottom, Paul Hurst Chris Doig pick pieces. Which extent. My hope season suffer nail biting relegation threatened campaign. Mid-table mediocrity just fine. Daniel Survival achieved despite defeat final day, depressing season; permanent managers, 30 players, usual rolling cast goalkeepers wages wasted players day (bye bye, Jermaine Pennant!) Any club loses 12 consecutive league games count itself lucky stay up, certainly do. Last summer recruitment disastrous. Painfully short back, overpaid striker Ishmael Miller managed league appearances. Call Ishmael? No thanks. Lee Clark arrived February immediately went back. We defended infinitely better, continuing rely James Vaughan end. 24 league goals return team finishing 19th league. Without clearly relegated room spare. Darrien After season, missed play-offs day, I fairly optimistic. Instead we gone square one. Our appalling away form, managerial changes star player going boil resulted season started badly ended staying League One teams worse us. Our big summer transfer Paul Konchesky. After 34 appearances QPR season, considered he'd marked improvement defence. The fact dropped levels Billericay Town says summer recruitment. If 17th place bad Justin Edinburgh sacked, 20th place curtains Ady Pennock. David It looked bad pre-season chairman forced Rob Page progressively good team professionals pushed aside Bruno Ribeiro group unproven European players seemingly picked random agent catalogue. Even early signs promising outsiders, play-offs November, watching Port Vale week week surprised wheels fell off. The quality display expectations. Chairman Norman Smurfwaite decided gamble stability foreign legion plan, backfired. Players like Paolo Tavares big money year contracts despite performances suggesting League Two him. Smurfwaite needs sell club. Vale make money bankroll second tier. The stadium infrastructure big sustain football, profitable reward investor. League 2 football just accumulate debt dwindling crowds. Tom Hughes Hello League Two, it long enough! But writing wall mid-November and, despite raft loan signings window, inevitable happened penultimate game season. We chairman concerned finances results. There strained relationship club local media. We manager actually coach. And there Tim Sherwood... Shaun Crowe Aside day sun Wembley, horrendous. We did win league game 1 October, turned away league victory. We second manager season then. We broke club records, depressing managers managed score league match. Tony Mowbray pathetic transfer window summer. Russell Slade did know players pick play ended using January transfer window badly Mowbray used summer one. Our inept owners preventing focusing football. When I got season ticket, Coventry Premier League club. Now I support fourth-tier club, mainly 20 years horrific mismanagement. Paul Knowles This total shambles season. Rock table, courted controversy signing Ched Evans, save underperforming squad zero quality. Boss Danny Wilson funds improve sacked prematurely. He replaced Gary Caldwell, new ideas budget. Owner Dave Allen pulled plug slowly selling superb players Paul Cook built quality side. Despite sales, club massive debt. On that, director football, Chris Turner, PR skills David Brent directors do overly bothered. This season we seen fake raffle winner announced local pie suppliers Jacksons having contract terminated save cash. James Stan Kroenke insisted remains committed Arsenal shares not, been, sale. KSE UK, holding company American Arsenal, issued statement London Stock Exchange Monday following media speculation concerning commitment Premier League club, missed Premier League time 20 years. The Russian businessman Alisher Usmanov, owns 30% club, formal 1bn bid buy Arsenal, Kroenke intention relinquishing 67% holding. A statement London Stock Exchange read: KSE UK, Inc notes recent media speculation concerning shareholding Arsenal Holdings PLC confirms shares not, been, sale. KSE committed, long term investor Arsenal remain so. Arsenal facing multimillion pound drop revenue failing qualify Champions League statement intent KSE indicates Kroenke Emirates Stadium long haul. Arsenal come short Premier League win FA Cup seasons play holders, Chelsea, Wembley Saturday. Kroenke, though, face battle win trust supporters believe change needed boardroom. Chants majority shareholder get club resonated ground Arsenal 3-1 win Everton Sunday, proved fifth place. The future manager Arsne Wenger remains unresolved. Wenger chose join players traditional lap appreciation Sunday offered support Kroenke post-match press conference. I respect Stan Kroenke lot. He fault reach Champions League, Wenger said. It technical department responsible that. I do that. Wenger accepts doubts surrounding staying past end contract contributed absolutely horrendous environment club. He refused confirm stay season and, missing Premier League time 1996, Wenger said uncertainty helped. Overall I believe played January difficult environment different reasons, Wenger said. The psychological environment players absolutely horrendous. Arsenal play Europa League time season missing Europe premier tournament sit star players. The futures Alexis Snchez Mesut zil, particular, far certain. Arsenal selection concerns FA Cup final, defender Laurent Koscielny banned following red card Sunday, Gabriel carried stretcher sustaining knee injury. Massimiliano Allegri want eye baggage scanner Juan Cuadrado checks week flight Cardiff. The Colombian tipped bottles water manager wake Juventus Coppa Italia win Wednesday, sealed Scudetto covered boss foam instead. Is premature ask celebration Cuadrado mind Champions League triumph? There small matter final Real Madrid through, all. But obstacle remaining Juve pursuit treble. For sixth season running, Serie A champions. No team Italy, England, Spain Germany won consecutive domestic titles before. Juve commemorative T-shirts bore word LE6END'. They sale club shop Sunday game Crotone kicked off. A tiny bit presumptuous failed win previous league fixtures? Not really. Allegri deliberate choice focus cups half month, rotating team accordingly. That luxury Juventus afford. It false pretend 3-1 defeat Roma stung them. As Gigi Buffon it, even 39 years old, I do like making arse myself. Ultimately, though, loss served sharpen focus. Crotone arrived J-Stadium Serie A form team, 17 points seven games, desperate one: battling top-flight survival. They played courage commitment, pressing Juventus high pitch striking fast counter. But moment Mario Mandzukic converted Cuadrado cross 12th minute, knew match over. Paulo Dybala 2-0 sumptuous free-kick, Alex Sandro added late third. Fans unfurled familiar banner Curva Sud: La Signora Ha Vinto Ancora  The [Old] Lady won again. She makes look easy, too. In reality, but. As Allegri reminded reporters full-time, Roma course finish second 87 points. Napoli, just them, achieved club record getting 83. Only constant evolution Juventus able stay ahead pursuit. The team beat Crotone included players enjoying season club: Gonzalo Higuan, Miralem Pjanic, Dani Alves, Mehdi Benatia Toms Rincn. All Sunday scorers joined summer 2015  meaning club run Champions League final. How does team sustain success ever-changing cast? In past years, alone, Juventus bid farewell Paul Pogba, Arturo Vidal, Alvaro Morata, Carlos Tevez, Andrea Pirlo. And yet, stronger. In part, testament small group players remained throughout. Together Buffon titles Leonardo Bonucci, Giorgio Chiellini, Andrea Barzagli, Stephan Lichtsteiner Claudio Marchisio. It sort backbone teams dream of. But fantastically shrewd transfer dealings. General manager, Beppe Marotta, unearthed gem  free transfers Pirlo, Alves Sami Khedira Dybala, looks snip 40m. Even Higuan 90m fee does feel excessive light 32 goals all-around contribution team achievements. More this, Marotta, fellow directors, worked make sure Juventus strong financial footing going forwards. The Bianconeri doubled annual revenue years alone, gap Europe richest clubs remains substantial. Marotta smartest move, though, appoint Allegri manager. A man pelted eggs fans day manager 2014 called Curva Sud Sunday. It Ultras implored bring cup Cardiff. Allegri barrel contradictions times, man released tactics app loves tell journalists formations unimportant, insisting best kind manager the does damage. But escaping fact mid-season shift hybrid 4-2-3-1 turning point. Juventus hardly struggling January, safely Champions League knock-out rounds, performances grown stale. After 2-1 defeat Fiorentina, Allegri knew change. Many sceptical vision Higuan, Mandzukic, Dybala, Cuadrado Pjanic starting XI, seeing way losing balance. Allegri pulled adapting Mandzukic new role left wing drawing Pjanic position defence. His team won 10 games, five-star Juve born. Whether stick final Madrid remains seen. He manager tailors team opponent, witnessed Champions League semi-final Monaco, Allegri reverted starting (although, practice, formations fluid match  shape changing depending Juventus ball). If gets right, look forward dousing Cuadrado. If not, remain memorable campaign. To record-breaking consecutive Coppa Italia, Juventus added record-breaking sixth-consecutive Scudetto. And yet, still, want more.  Juventus players joined pitch kids trophy presentation, joyful occasion Bonucci oldest son, Lorenzo. A Torino supporter, looked decidedly unimpressed wear father colours.  Buffon was, understandably, nostalgic mood, posting Instagram memories Serie B title won Juventus 10 years ago. He column published La Stampa, observed  stressing desire pick fight officials  considered 10th title overall, including formally stripped away result Calciopoli scandal. Above all, eager pay tribute team-mates  past present  stress success easily obtained. We won. Again, wrote. For sixth time row. A record shared Barza, Chiello, Leo, Stephan Claudio: old men group (I say old' manner speaking, obviously  referring Andrea, really old). As months, matches wins passed by, lots people talked preannounced victory', smooth path, title running downhill, manifest superiority. I agree. That thought somebody won, tends trivialise hard work succeed. In sixth Scudetto, discounted, predictable safe. We favourites, sure, built seasons. But started zero, discussion, battled won. Nobody gifted anything. Every opponent gave us. Everyone cheered us. And that normal. The strongest bad guys. But I antipathy I leave envy club, club, managed build.  All hope lost Crotone, odds certainly stage. They remain point Empoli longer catch Genoa, beat Torino. Crotone win head-to-head tie-breaker Tuscans, need result Lazio final weekend chance. Empoli, meanwhile, far inviting fixture away relegated Palermo.  The race second likewise wire.

Thanks Scoring Sunderland season major feat doing style people seen took real ingenuity. The start routine enough: United played ball wide (after Sunderland gave away), Zlatan Ibrahimovic collected Henrik Mkhitaryan darted centre-backs. Then Ibrahimovic cross flew slightly Mkhitaryan; Armenian blew minds. Allowing himself fall forward, Mkhitaryan hooked right leg used heel flick ball past bewildered goalkeeper. The goal meant terms result redefined possible players do, putting similar plane Cruyff turn, Panenka penalty Beckham sarong. Of course, goal should counted Mkhitaryan offside.

The dive Crystal Palace goalkeeper moments ball whizzed past going make difference outcome Andy Carroll amazing shot, emphasis just powerful shot was. Few scissors-kicks struck perfectly. This Exhibit A Z case says Carroll just great header ball. Every goal season competition needs blaster outside box. But blaster, Henderson whack hope best.

Louise Taylor: Sam Clucas, Hull City; runner up, David Luiz, Chelsea. There other, far obvious, candidates placed context Clucas achievement ascending rungs league ladder successive seasons left-footed midfielder. Impressive shifted wide role central midfield term, intelligence Clucas passing bears hallmarks Glenn Hoddle, persuaded game honing skills football academy Spain. David Luiz, meanwhile, lovely watch re-invention Antonio Conte thoroughly confounded doubters. Stuart James: Gylfi Sigurdsson. Directly involved 22 Swansea City 43 goals. For player continually create score goals team spent entire season fighting relegation quite something. Jacob Steinberg: After season sabbatical, Eden Hazard rediscovered mojo thrilling style consistency outrageous talent.

Yes, 6-1 defeat Spurs but, taking broader view, Schmeichel example troubled times. Simon Burnton: The brilliant, hard-working, humble likeable N'Golo Kant deserves player-of-the-season awards currently cluttering mantelpiece. Ed Aarons: N'Golo Kant deserves awards winning second successive Premier League title, Christian Eriksen return form coincided Tottenham emergence Chelsea genuine challengers. Even 13 assists Premier League goals explain importance Denmark international Mauricio Pochettino. Csar Azpilicueta deserves mention. Sachin Nakrani: Gylfi Sigurdsson. The Iceland international directly contributed half Swansea Premier League goals and, quite simply, relegated, suffering fallout comes that, which, remembered, includes people losing jobs. Daniel Taylor: Antonio Conte. Even Jos Mourinho stopped  temporarily,  trying undermine him. How, possibly, question Chelsea top? Barney Ronay: Antonio Conte. Hurled hoof wonderfully well-grooved champion team, eased John Terry picture slightest friction match days remains ludicrously excited man ever. Dominic Fifield: Antonio Conte. In league crammed elite managers, adapted best peculiarities Premier League ended putting big names shame.

His better look story told 20 years now. Jamie Jackson: Antonio Conte. He coached volatile Costa 20 league goals win classic English double debut season. Andy Hunter: Conte stand-out choice, winning Premier League title season English football responded potential crises  notably 3-0 defeat Arsenal January stand-off Costa. Louise Taylor: Sean Dyche, Burnley. Antonio Conte clearly strong case while, despite narrowly failing Hull up, Marco Silva turned water wine east Yorkshire. Then there Mauricio Pochettino, Tottenham team play fabulous football half collective wage sides, keeping Burnley Premier League significant achievement. Given relatively limited resources Dyche, Jos Mourinho Pep Guardiola like well? Stuart James: Antonio Conte. Hugely impressive win title season English football  tactically astute, passion game gives impression player, regularly starting XI, buys work. Jacob Steinberg: A nod Sean Dyche keeping Burnley away relegation scrap, Conte, outperformed rivals reviving misfiring, uneven squad power motivational qualities, tactical acumen infectious win.

The switch 3-4-3 defined Conte success Juventus midfielder shown man-management skills dealing Diego Costa regular tantrums. Sachin Nakrani: Antonio Conte. Winning title season England superb achievement, particularly involves reinvigorating squad turmoil previous campaign. Daniel Taylor: Olivier Giroud scorpion kick Arsenal Crystal Palace. Barney Ronay: Giroud running scorpion volley, lovely ludicrous finish, improbable fact stop mid-scorpion winch leg little higher, like stiff man trying wriggle way garden fence. Dominic Fifield: Eden Hazard Arsenal, sprinting away Laurent Koscielny holding Francis Coquelin attempts bring down, finishing Shkodran Mustafi block. Paul Wilson: Sam Allardyce concerned unconvincing Crystal Palace defending, Andy Carroll overhead kick Crystal Palace takes beating wow factor. Not team goal, perhaps, Carroll lot himself it. Amy Lawrence: The Emre Can/Giroud/Henrikh Mkhitaryan showpieces lead way individualism, struck chord Willian goal Chelsea Everton game felt influential title. What fine team goal. The quality Cesc Fbregas run pass Willian summed brio Chelsea rediscovered season. That moment felt undeniably like champions again. Barry Glendenning: Gastn Ramrez. Possibly best, certainly thing Middlesbrough footballer season  Ramrez fine solo effort sent goal-shy Boro way home win. Picking ball inside half encouraged strange reluctance Bournemouth shirt close down, Uruguayan embarked 70-yard run inside left climaxed abruptly cutting inside slotting home. Buoyed rare moment quality inspiration, Middlesbrough went win Premier League matches, increasingly unpopular summer signing score goal sank depths. David Hytner: Andy Carroll v Crystal Palace. Nothing ability bring jaws floor quickly thumping scissor kick. Especially executed big man. Scott Murray: Olivier Giroud Palace. A finish absurd it easy forget six-player pitch-long romp preceded it, embellished centre-circle back-flick Giroud himself. English football eye-catching sweep forward Terry McDermott scored Spurs 1978. Jamie Jackson: Henrikh Mkhitaryan scorpion kick versus Sunderland Boxing Day. Zlatan Ibrahimovic pings cross right Armenian lets flying back-heeled volley. Delicious. Andy Hunter: Dimitri Payet, West Ham United v Middlesbrough. Other goals carried weight context season  Emre Can Watford Eden Hazard v Arsenal notable examples  based purely merits fleeting reminder quality France international bring Premier League equals. Louise Taylor: Robert Snodgrass v Leicester City. The winner 2-1 shock opening-day victory defending champions Mike Phelan side. When Wes Morgan half-clear Ahmed Elmohamady vicious cross, ball fell Snodgrass first-time, left footed, half-volley arrowed corner. Stuart James: Emre Can bicycle kick Watford beating. In fairness, Olivier Giroud scorpion kick Palace worthy mention. Jacob Steinberg: Gaston Ramrez slaloming 70-yard run Bournemouth ended clever trick cool finish. Sure, Andy Carroll, Olivier Giroud Henrikh Mkhitaryan took breath away scorpion kicks bicycle blasts. But grim season Middlesbrough, fact Ramrez solo effort rare moment excitement makes precious. Simon Burnton: Olivier Giroud New Year Day scorpion kick was January goal month, rival volleys compare it, mind best bunch. It grown scorer grown me: game said was bit lucky. It thing I do. I tried hit backheel luck, March saying: I do want big myself goals like leave mark history. Andy Carroll [overhead kick] magnificent, maybe people wo remember years' time. Mine, yes. Paul Doyle: Wayne Rooney Stoke. It hell way snatch late equaliser, set wonderful record convince Jos Mourinho finally jilt over-the-hill hero.

Daniel Taylor: At risk sounding like misery, it easy think stand-out match season. Nothing left excited as, say, seeing Monaco Champions League. Barney Ronay: Swansea 5-4 Crystal Palace. Messy, wild desperate times, basically Premier League for. Dominic Fifield: Bournemouth madcap 4-3 win Liverpool entertaining, Crystal Palace win Chelsea April encapsulated baffling nature Premier League times. Chelsea superb going forward, playing wonderfully incisive inventive football. Palace defended ruggedly and, somehow, kept out. Paul Wilson: The sticks mind Manchester City 1-3 Chelsea. An eventful entertaining game, dead-eyed finishing Chelsea leave Pep Guardiola moaning Kevin Bruyne miss rest season. A significant title pointer Etihad too, second successive season following Leicester statement win February. Amy Lawrence: Swansea 5-4 Crystal Palace. Lovely, wonderful, beautiful, panicked madness. The best Bob Bradley experience. Alan Pardew trying brave face. First Match Day unanticipated game. What like? Barry Glendenning: Bournemouth 4-3 Liverpool. They do entertaining white-knuckle ride Vitality Stadium. David Hytner: Swansea v Crystal Palace. Never mind defending ends, classic, loaded drama, scenes Fernando Llorente stoppage-time winner shake Liberty Stadium. Both managers, Bob Bradley Alan Pardew, sacked month so. Scott Murray: Manchester City 1-1 Liverpool. It really would taken game ended 5-0, 0-5 5-5. One those. Jamie Jackson: Burnley emphatic win Liverpool Turf Moor season second weekend punched hole title pretensions Jrgen Klopp team suggested Sean Dyche men survive. Those auguries proved correct. Andy Hunter: Everton 4-0 Manchester City. Selecting Premier League matches attended, raucous afternoon Goodison Park stands reasons. In Ronald Koeman eyes really perfect total team performance Everton. It confirmed emergence Tom Davies, scored goal club exquisite chip Claudio Bravo Gwladys Street end, brought debut goal Ademola Lookman teenager touches Premier League. For Pep Guardiola, however, underlined defensive mental frailties Manchester City, represented heaviest league defeat managerial career left conceding title team season. Louise Taylor: If means watched live, it difficult answer. As north-east correspondent I certainly seen candidates worst game Sunderland Middlesbrough better ones I covered invariably involved Newcastle United Championship. One top-tier game does stick memory though; Hull 3-3 Crystal Palace December. A six-goal thriller featuring brilliant, mesmerising performance Palace Wilfried Zaha. Stuart James: Swansea City 5-4 Crystal Palace. A nine-goal thriller 1-1 25 minutes remaining  hell let loose. Bob Bradley Alan Pardew, respective managers, went emotion going and, truth, was really surprising man lasted longer job. For it worth, reporters game terrible state come end. Jacob Steinberg: Crystal Palace 0-4 Sunderland. Sunderland surprised scoring goals single half did win game relegated. In defence, I just recovered shock well. Simon Burnton: Liverpool 4-3 win Emirates season opening weekend ask more. Excellent attacking, lovely goals open play, gorgeous free kick, brilliant individual skill, embarrassing manager-hugging celebrations, sunshine, lot. The possible reaction yes please, I months that. Which, sadly, team deliver. Paul Doyle: Leicester 4-2 Manchester City. Thrilling times brilliant, bizarre, outrageous laughable. A snapshot season Premier League. Ed Aarons: Swansea 5-4 Palace. Leading 4-3 game past 90-minute mark, Alan Pardew felt pretty good. His team just battled 3-1 15 minutes remaining lead, surrender points Fernando Llorente double injury time. Sachin Nakrani: Manchester City 1-1 Liverpool. A high-octane, end-to-end, relentlessly-thrilling encounter let poor finishing. A mention, too, Swansea 5-4 victory Crystal Palace. A madcap encounter saw goals stoppage time Alan Pardew fearing worst. Daniel Taylor: Keith Hackett. I criticisms current crop marvel mistake life. Barney Ronay: Clatts. Will missed, unintentional comedy, leaves Sauds. Dominic Fifield: Probably Martin Atkinson Michael Oliver. Paul Wilson: No idea. They look me. Let say Martin Atkinson. Amy Lawrence: Michael Oliver does want star some. He gives impression wanting best game possible. Barry Glendenning: Mike Dean. His no-look yellow card Ross Barkley Merseyside derby Goodison Park thing beauty. David Hytner: I do strong feelings category season. I'd say Mark Clattenburg best. Scott Murray: Referees lightning rods impotent frustration, rampant paranoia myopic rage. Objective praise does come it, it they for. Jamie Jackson: The video official  brave innovation. What? They exist despite having access ad nauseam replays? Andy Hunter: Any nomination incur wrath club  Anthony Taylor continues improve  interests harmony let just say it Jon Moss. Louise Taylor: Probably Mark Clattenburg (despite missing season following Saudi Arabia.) Stuart James: Not excited here. Martin Atkinson, Mark Clattenburg (yes, I realise he gone) Michael Oliver three. Oliver, good day, gets nod. Jacob Steinberg: Michael Oliver gets vote, capped punishing Manchester United cynical rotational fouling Hazard FA Cup. Simon Burnton: Mark Clattenburg. He looks like thinks he best referee land, unappealing, does make wrong. Paul Doyle: Mike Dean. The enforce shirt-tugging directive close consistency. And technology mannerisms entertaining his. Ed Aarons: Mark Clattenburg Martin Atkinson usually biggest gigs Uefa Fifa, Michael Oliver remains outstanding referee country. Still 32, Ashington official charge matches (31) issued just red cards. Sachin Nakrani: Unlike 99% people watch football country, I do strong view referees. They roughly mistakes, occasionally astonishing, entice reaching pitchfork. Daniel Taylor: Mamadou Sakho. People laughed January loan signing nominated Crystal Palace player season award. But Palace down. Barney Ronay: Leroy San. What lovely mover, calm head, nice young man. Seems real limit good be. Dominic Fifield: N'Golo Kant key Leicester City startling success 2016, just influential Chelsea 2017. A blur energy interceptions, heart Chelsea achieved. Paul Wilson: Where Manchester United Zlatan Ibrahimovic contribution? Hardly best value signing, exactly future either, injury struck brought do. Amy Lawrence: Hard argue Kant overall impact. Honourable mentions Mamadou Sakho big difference Crystal Palace predicament, Gabriel Jesus great signing looks bound shine Manchester City future. Barry Glendenning: N'Golo Kant. David Hytner: David Luiz. Has shown underneath mad hair lies intelligent reader game. Has excelled middle three. Long passing remains beautiful watch. Scott Murray: Gabriel Jesus, score-any-sort genius destined rattle absurd number goals. Had picked injury February, Manchester City given Chelsea race. Jamie Jackson: Eric Bailly. Manchester United appear filled Nemanja Vidic-sized gap created 2014 departure. Costing 30m Villarreal, Ivorian tough, dominant 23-year-old fixture decade. Andy Hunter: Paul Clement. Swansea City looking certain relegation appointed manager campaign January. Astute signings Tom Carroll convincing squad buy managerial voice enabled Bayern Munich assistant impact shape club short-term future. Louise Taylor: Eric Bailly Manchester United. At 30m was cheap goodness knows far United Mourinho sunk Bailly central defensive excellence. Stuart James: N'Golo Kant there, obvious piece business Chelsea part, given Frenchman impact Leicester season before. With mind, taking account size fee, I Victor Wanyama, Tottenham 11m recruit Southampton. Jacob Steinberg: On basis signing Kant no-brainer season exploits, admire Chelsea making return David Luiz success. It easy forget plenty doubts Brazilian signed deadline day. Simon Burnton: Crystal Palace won 30 games played Mamadou Sakho line-up season, Liverpool loanee appeared, keeping clean sheets process (counting 1-0 defeat Spurs, forced 57 goalless minutes conceded 78th). No signing transformational. Paul Doyle: Mamadou Sakho. Liverpool outcast, Crystal Palace saviour. Ed Aarons: Hard argue N'Golo Kant 30m, transferred blue title-winning shirt minimum fuss. Victor Wanyama, 11m Southampton, effect Tottenham, albeit price. Sachin Nakrani: Zlatan Ibrahimovic. I people thought 35-year-old, undeniably talented, struggle England. Instead gone best free transfers Premier League history. Daniel Taylor: Pep Guardiola. Maybe expectations high but, waiting, real disappointment. Claudio Bravo comes close second, probably illustrates point. Barney Ronay: Claudio Bravo course, goalkeeper I seen receive ironic round applause fans making save. Dominic Fifield: Moussa Sissoko hardly pulled trees Tottenham Hotspur record signing, come surprise watched regularly Newcastle United. Paul Wilson: The man tired London. Dimitri Payet big letdown West Ham United. The club 2015-16 player year inspiration stadium mural ought able manage season leaving. Amy Lawrence: Jointly awarded Manchester United Arsenal, able mount challenge Premier League title despite recruiting heavily summer apparently boost push. Barry Glendenning: Pep Guardiola. Tasked difficult job management far, admission Manchester City manager come woefully short. David Hytner: Simone Zaza. His ludicrous penalty Euros Italy merely prelude. Saw loan spell West Ham United cut short 11 matches goals because, played bit more, club buy outright. Moved Valencia January. Scott Murray: Pep Guardiola arrived England big reputation ... super-surly press conferences. His glorious disdain daft questions times shone  simply majestic  Fergie Louis van Gaal levels consistency. He got press corps rattled, though, repeated raising subject Sunday Supplement by. He needs kill. Jamie Jackson: Claudio Bravo. Pep Guardiola probably blew Manchester City hopes winning season bombing Joe Hart paying 14.5m Chilean 25 August. Bravo word? Hapless. Andy Hunter: Claudio Bravo. There expensive mistakes Manchester City goalkeeper  Tottenham 30m outlay Moussa Sissoko example  recruitment fundamental Pep Guardiola envisaged season Premier League served undermine it. That say mistake replace Joe Hart, toiled Torino, Bravo wrong choice. Louise Taylor: Moussa Sissoko, Tottenham Hotspur. Rafael Bentez rightly proud persuading Spurs 30m midfielder played big Newcastle United relegation year Euro 2016 cameos France flattered deceive. Indeed HMRC recently raided St James' Park, club staff joked investigating the theft 30m Spurs. Stuart James: A mix  Borja Bastn Swansea, Jordon Ibe Bournemouth Ahmed Musa Leicester come mind. But Claudio Bravo, Manchester City 17m goalkeeper, surely standout candidate. What thinking of, Pep? Jacob Steinberg: Eleven games, goals shot went throw: hands Simone Zaza! Simon Burnton: Jos Mourinho end season trophies lengthy unbeaten run, sixth place represents significant underachievement. Plus continues extremely aggravating. Paul Doyle: Giannelli Imbula. Stoke record signing potential dominate Premier League midfields, ca squad ahead Charlie Adam. Ed Aarons: So choose summer saw Premier League clubs spend money like before. Borja Bastn Jordon Ibe disappointed arriving Bournemouth Swansea record signings, Leicester Ahmed Musa failed recapture form saw year champions pay 17m services. Sachin Nakrani: David Moyes. Sunderland season tale unrelenting misery manager central figure. Yes squad inherited poor, claiming August  August!  locked relegation battle hardly helped matters. The Scot stunk place there. Daniel Taylor: Gary Neville Jamie Carragher properly and, necessary, criticise clubs. Their Monday night analysis is, not, entertaining actual matches. Barney Ronay: Obvious, Gary Neville, stays ahead Jamie Carragher mainly does weird habit taking really long breath just standing speaking ages, eventually saying ... look defence ... Dominic Fifield: Frank Lampard showcased punditry ability weeks season, looks natural role. Paul Wilson: Frank Lampard takes, knowledgeable articulate. Keith Andrews looks like future. Steve McManaman pretty good, getting Scouse grows older. Amy Lawrence: Graeme Souness. Always worth listening to, boy does look like means it. Barry Glendenning: The erudite opinions Sky Sports pundit Danny Higginbotham invariably passed pub discussions Championship, I do lot of. David Hytner: The standard improving year-on-year. I like Graeme Souness Jermaine Jenas, Roy Keane worth watching simply fear puts studio. Scott Murray: The word pundit derived Sanskrit learned man. So working etymological basis, modern definition ex-pro phoning Sky Sports News coin, Ken Early Second Captains? Fiercely intelligent witty analysis frequently sails avant-garde. Jamie Jackson: Jamie Carragher. Always adds emotes open differing points view. Andy Hunter: Graeme Souness. There strong temptation different choice year came Souness withering critique Jos Mourinho excuses following Manchester United goalless draw Southampton. Anger suits pundit offers cutting insight player manager perspective. Louise Taylor: Alan Shearer. Radically improved, refreshingly opinionated and, all, interesting. Stuart James: Gary Neville longer leading way one. Jamie Carragher decent. I like Alan Shearer, better came scene, Graeme Souness. You want winner? Carragher. Jacob Steinberg: Ian Wright bit excitable start television career, humour decency shone season. Simon Burnton: Sky Monday Night Football continues offer best football analysis British television, Gary Neville remains sharpest, perceptive voice. Paul Doyle: Joey Barton. He talked good game. Ed Aarons: Danny Murphy deserves mention no-nonsense approach Jermaine Jenas insightful informed BBC stepped game season. Sachin Nakrani: Chris Sutton. Listening man hates humanity views Burnley 1-1 Hull radio for. Daniel Taylor: England motorway network night matches. There is road Shropshire I do know days. Barney Ronay: Once actual title race, attempts massage Spurs pulling waving distance. Backed seven streets ahead else. For league prides itself competitiveness, competitive Dominic Fifield: The constant chopping changing kick-off times, admittedly makes sound like grumpy old sod. Friday night football just does feel right, do started midday kick-offs Sunday. Those Hull City supporters Selhurst Park penultimate weekend performed heroics. Paul Wilson: Same ever, tasteless intelligence-insulting gambling ads surround game. Instead just making example Joey Barton, FA chuck money-lenders temple. Amy Lawrence: Fly-by messages. To paraphrase great Brian Clough, If God wanted watch football clouds he'd grass sky. Barry Glendenning: The breezy disdain TV schedulers continue treat people actually games pairing teams opposite ends country lunchtime Monday evening kick-offs. David Hytner: Quite simply, Wenger situation allowed run wild Arsenal season? There sagas sagas. This tested patience saints, let football fans. Scott Murray: Last season freewheeling Chelsea-Tottenham donnybrook suggested old-fashioned bench-emptying brawl soon fashion. But no. Referees captains intervening calming things down. Let events natural course, you! Better in, vicarious fun could fight way wet paper bag. Jamie Jackson: Players having man-managed'. You Premier League footballer. You living dream. Any chance man-managing yourself? Andy Hunter: The blatant disregard away supporters selecting kick-off times. Has problem appears getting worse. The proposals season festive schedule  implemented rounds matches played 16 December 1 January shorten season ahead World Cup  threaten continue trend. Louise Taylor: The negativity David Moyes Sunderland Aitor Karanka Middlesbrough. No wonder teams relegated  Sean Dyche Marco Silva (who surely kept Hull he'd season charge)  proved fortune really does favour brave. Stuart James: Guesswork applied key refereeing decisions  do point spot you sure. Jos Mourinho moaning pretty tiresome well. Jacob Steinberg: The tedious moral outrage greeted Claudio Ranieri sacking Leicester City, looked good bet replacing Italian Craig Shakespeare. So players wanted out? It does make rats weasels; makes professionals. Simon Burnton: Nonsensically enormous home-and-away performance dichotomies. It hard comprehend Burnley, team capable winning points home, manage seven away. Hull Tottenham guilty here. On coin Crystal Palace, consistency marvel joy. Paul Doyle: People complaining player power blind obedience better. Ed Aarons: For money flowing Premier League, lack formulated plan encourage managers young English players chance remains absent. Bridging gap youth team team vital maintain overall standard competition future years. Sachin Nakrani: The ubiquity betting adverts. I chose season and, anything, got worse, issue particularly pressing light figures showing Britons lost 12.6bn gambling year. Daniel Taylor: It obviously sensitive, say least, it time Liverpool relevant people Merseyside listened growing number fans realise safe-standing embraced. Barney Ronay: Give FA Cup winners Champions League spot just confuse everybody. Dominic Fifield: I repeat: having 25-man match-day squads, guarantee nurtured club academy youth system? That encourage youngsters benches chance game-time flight. Paul Wilson: Everton finish higher Liverpool, please. Failing that, good quite encouraging number English home grown managers Premier League operating half table. Amy Lawrence: With experiments increasing, sooner Premier League fast-track video referees assist difficult decisions, better. Barry Glendenning: The record, Jos. Change bloody record. David Hytner: It said I strongly believe summer transfer window close night Premier League season starts. I'd like transfer fees public, including loan fees. Scott Murray: All pseudo-heraldic club crests ditched replaced 1970s-influenced stylised logo. Good, crisp, clear design, guaranteed appal small-c conservatives everywhere. Jamie Jackson: Can rolling seven-day-a-week Premier League programme, please? Andy Hunter: The trial of, renewed debate appropriate level about, safe standing Premier League grounds. Louise Taylor: The abolition Friday night games. Invariably inconvenient fans actually matches. Stuart James: Clamp dissent  far goes still. And sooner video assistant referees introduced, better. Jacob Steinberg: Stop squeezing Premier League matches Thursday nights. Simon Burnton: Scrap Friday night football altogether. Unpopular TV viewers schedulers, officially thing. Football fans deserve need night off. Paul Doyle: Teams docked point losing scoring. Ed Aarons: The introduction video assistant referees long overdue, retrospective punishment players guilty simulation'. The challenge ensure VAR does impinge general flow game. Sachin Nakrani: No Jos Mourinho. I John Lennon, sat piano, asking imagine Premier League sour-faced, relentlessly spiteful, ultra-negative generally washed-up manager Manchester United. Marvellous, is it? While Premier League season top-flight players having forsaken metaphorical beach actual sand surf summer unimaginative holiday destination choice footballers happens be, Rumour Mill does relax.

Wenger defended Kroenke, saying fault squad fallen short, admitted toxic atmosphere club factor worst league campaign near 21-year tenure. For time finished outside places. The fans divided Wenger stay contract expires summer protests season began unravel home defeat Watford 31 January. Wenger expected continue clarity FA Cup final Chelsea Saturday. The lack season, however, cast long shadows. I believe January played difficult environment different reasons, Wenger said. Some know  difficult group players cope  [there are] reasons talk day. But psychological environment group players absolutely horrendous. It difficult and, certainly, personal situation contributed that. But I professional and, long I somewhere, I job day. You question love loyalty club I said club world stay restricted finances years. So I do understand [there is] question [about] commitment. We professional perform environment positive. We look excuse I just say it fact does help. Wenger asked accepted responsibility cause negative mood. Yes, course. He join post-match lap appreciation  said wanted players the quiet lap honour deserved  vague evasive reasons lack clarity situation. It understood offer two-year contract table months. He asked terms changedat point. It emerged, recently, chief executive, Ivan Gazidis, wants make various structural tweaks, including scouting coaching. I do understand want hear situation sorted soon, Wenger said. So let prepare Cup final. We won games, despite lack clarity, just focus win one. When lack clarity affect team? It good question. I answer today. I answer day. But today. Wenger said know Kroenke attended Everton. I respect Stan Kroenke lot. He fault reach Champions League. It technical department responsible that. The schedulers got wrong comes building grand finale Magic Weekend. At times sport annual on-the-road jamboree ended whimper different portions hors d'oeuvres set tone enthralling main course team rugby league wants right now. If deserved platform backdrop St James' Park provides Magic Weekend, Castleford. They led way start year, looked irrepressible large periods and, tellingly championship aspirations, capable winning different ways. For 40 minutes pushed hard Leeds. That game level break fair indication things gone point, second half Castleford teams year blew away. In 17 blistering minutes, Castleford ran tries highest order  competition try-scorer, Greg Eden  increase lead Super League table points. Right now, looks capable keeping pace Tigers. Critics scorned won May  right. But win end Magic Weekend display credentials able pace and, 14 games in, Castleford ticking boxes required way. Yet attention day finale Castleford Leeds, Salford continued suggest capability mount quite remarkable title challenge season moving second table victory day middle game. The Red Devils remarkable journey season Million Pound Game top-four challenge 2017 overshadowed exploits Castleford, latest victory, Leigh Centurions, makes half unlikely leading duo years. The Centurions, won months, actually led 12-6 stage tries Ben MurdochMasila, Kris Welham Greg Johnson Salford control half-time. From rarely troubled  Ben Crooks reduced gap half-time. Further tries Niall Evalds second Johnson ensured Leigh arms length: sending Adam Higson adding Centurions' misery. Day began whimper, given highlights aplenty Newcastle weekend  Huddersfield care bit. They just points shy beating Catalans look increasing danger dragged Qualifiers come Super 8s. The Dragons led scrappy affair 10-6 heading tries Sam Rapira Adam O'Brien secured unlikely victory. That massive us, absolutely, Huddersfield coach, Rick Stone, said. He wrong. It came third-highest Magic Weekend attendance history, crowd 30,046 Sunday combining make 65,407 aggregate overall. Incidentally, Magic attendances? The years Newcastle. You good thing, Super League surely is ready say goodbye Newcastle just yet. Essex took 13 wickets tea day twice bowl Hampshire 150 complete remarkable victory innings 92 runs. In doing so, moved Division One. Hampshire lost wickets runs second day, wreckage cease morning Jamie Porter, bowler promise adapting nicely life Division One, dismissing Lewis McManus Kyle Abbott finish 24. The procession continued second innings, Hampshire lost lunch, Rilee Rossouw pair, lbw Simon Harmer, took second-innings wickets, second ball break. After Porter sent Sean Ervine stumps flying pick seventh match, George Bailey McManus provided resistance, avail. Highly fancied, heavily bolstered Hampshire took just single point match. It quite week Kumar Sangakkara Lord. On Wednesday, painting unveiled honour, Friday scored immaculate century, Sunday added another. His thirst quenched, passed 20,000 first-class runs runs later. And Surrey needed it. Sangakkara sidled crease inspired spell new ball Middlesex Toby Roland-Jones dismissed Mark Stoneman, caught slip, Rory Burns, lbw came slope, leave Surrey 16 two, 84 behind. That first-innings lead built fine century Middlesex captain, James Franklin, hefty hitting Roland-Jones, day served neat encapsulation offer England Test side. Sangakkara playing different game batsman, however, chiselled  inappropriate word given gentle style achieved  away deficit, built lead 96 close. He wafted hard ball, serene thereafter; neatly, reached second identical fashion  coverdriven Ollie Rayner. As ever, housework pads point sumptuous. Sangakkara chief ally Scott Borthwick, shared 123 Rayner pinned pad. Roland-Jones came attack late beauty bowl Dom Sibley. Sangakkara return Ben Foakes final day, game make safe. Another wise old legend game, Shivnarine Chanderpaul, scored century, 75th first-class career, steer Lancashire choppy waters Yorkshire. After Jack Brooks notched maiden ton  typically exuberant celebration boot  set Yorkshire declaration 448 eight, Lancashire lost wickets cheaply, including Haseeb Hameed duck, bowled beauty Brooks. In adversity Chanderpaul spotted opportunity. He shared 112 Ryan McLaren (63 out) bowled Ben Coad new ball. With first-innings wickets hand, including injured James Anderson, Lancashire trail 184. Warwickshire slim shot securing win season Somerset, team them. This largely thanks 175 Jonathan Trott, anchored innings 413. They took Somerset wickets, going debutant Grant Thornton (who seamer, multinational accounting firm). In Warwickshire way stands burly frame Marcus Trescothick, passed 25,000 first-class runs unbeaten 41. In Division Two leaders, Nottinghamshire, endured frustrating day inviting Glamorgan follow on, hosts plodded way 212 five, Colin Ingram ending unbeaten 72 209 balls. Notts' closest challengers, Kent, toiled Grace Road, closing 193 Leicestershire racked 420 innings. Another team lose, Worcestershire, fine day Derbyshire. They cleaned Derbyshire tail bowl 275, raced 323 openers, Brett D'Oliveira Daryl Mitchell, scoring centuries first-innings partnership 243 53.4 overs. They lead 48. The opening day Durham trip Hove saw precocious Sussex seamer Jofra Archer 76  including Keaton Jennings, bowled 12  visitors dismissed 287. Sussex reached stumps 43 reply, Harry Finch, caught cordon ball Graham Onions, wicket fall. The sun burned, Champions League hopes evaporated sudden lightning rod Arsenal supporters' disillusionment moved away man dugout Atlantic. The chant started North Bank suddenly spread, growing urgency coursed round stadium: Stan Kroenke  club. The news broke week Alisher Usmanov $1.3bn bid majority shareholding held Arsenal American investor broadened conversation club status ambitions. While disaffected generally pointed fingers Arsne Wenger club direction manager scrutiny. Kroenke expected England week FA Cup final. The microscope welcomes lens inevitably focus in. The Kroenke model sports franchises tends reach stars Arsenal fanbase want say that. The Wenger debate appears   quietened. For huff puff consequences finally slipping Champions League reckoning, end mood Emirates mild accepting. There hint home crowd final curtain time soon manager called shots decades. The impression crowd expecting situ Emirates Cup July. Wenger normally joins traditional lap appreciation time stayed sideline, watching edge pitch players waved absorbed good wishes Wembley. He thought best distance just case bit distraction  players deal with. His downcast disposition match suggested deep feels troubled proud record consecutive Champions League qualifications over, terms represents status symbol obvious lament Thursday nights far-flung travel ideal crammed busy schedule. Round parts used mockingly Spursday nights domain. Wenger said felt sad strange imagine life Champions League soundtrack. The time Arsenal finished league campaign particular prize 1997. Their final game now-defunct Baseball Ground. The old double act Ian Wright Dennis Bergkamp scored goals. As happened, Manchester United finished champions 75 points season  exactly Arsenal collected fifth-placed finish. Wenger candid accepting responsibility. The storm clouds accompanied questions future damaging. He said psychological environment squad deal darkest moments grew horrendous. (Which begs obvious question club able sort contract alleviate pressure.) Is season outside Champions League end world? How critical terms keeping players contracts winding down, like Alexis Snchez Mesut zil, attracting shiny new ones? Those conversations hold week, certainly FA Cup final. They head rendezvous champions, Chelsea, decent form  beating Everton halfway beach picked seventh win games. But worries, especially defensively. Laurent Koscielny curse misjudging challenge Enner Valencia. He clattered clumsily Everton forward, sent chance lead team Wembley FA Cup final scuppered. Gabriel Paulista overstretched knee left pitch visibly pained. Wenger assessed season came conclusion feel team far building stronger Premier League challenge. But instability uncertainty referenced harming needs resolution. It list: future Wenger, Snchez, zil, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, returning Jack Wilshere, Wojciech Szczesny, various members backroom staff, up-in-the-air director football role different name, head youth development ... It needs sorting considering strengthen squad. Forward Arsenal used old motto club sense drift needs addressing. The battle club soul lurks background. It fluttered foreground chants Kroenke direction, sense easily away persists. There twists turns end season Swansea City imagined chain events taken relegation zone matches remaining. Hull City surprise defeat home Sunderland opened window opportunity Swansea took advantage precious victories, courtesy Fernando Llorente header. It Llorente 13th goal season lift Swansea point ahead Hull, slipped three, prompting huge celebrations home supporters final whistle. With Hull travelling Crystal Palace Sunday, Swansea chance crank pressure clubs picking points Sunderland day before. The positive thought Paul Clement players right control destiny  scenario unthinkable start day, people wondering Swansea respond Hull opened five-point gap beating already-relegated Sunderland. The news Hull lost greeted jubilation home supporters fuelled raucous atmosphere inside Liberty Stadium, helping carry Swansea victory. It tense long periods especially closing stages, Clement admitted mind drifted chastening defeat Tottenham Hotspur, Swansea conceded late goals. On occasion, however, players refused buckle. Alfie Mawson outstanding central defence alongside excellent Federico Fernndez. The evergreen Leon Britton produced influential performance base Swansea midfield Jordan Ayew stopped running front. Yet Llorente produced game defining moment seventh headed goal season  Premier League player. Ronald Koeman left rue passage play disappointing away day Everton. They failed win seven matches road lack conviction attacking play source concern Everton manager. Everton failed score matches registered attempts goal run. In fact hard escape feeling that, little play end season, players' minds drifted summer. We know need improve, said Koeman. Most things team really good, [such as] defending organisation, difference scoring goals home away home big. Koeman tried change things Swansea starting Ross Barkley bench Everton looked flat half. Barkley introduced restart and, Everton possession second half, visitors created little note. Swansea actually looked likely score again. Ayew struck outside post volley, Mawson header blocked Barkley  Everton midfielder knew little  Leroy Fer desperately unlucky score met Tom Carroll fine cross first-time shot Maarten Stekelenburg saved point-blank range. Llorente forgiving 29th minute. Ayew architect, forward twisting turning close byline away Gareth Barry delivering inch-perfect cross implored Llorente nod home. Towering Phil Jagielka, Spaniard squeezed header past Maarten Stekelenburg stadium erupted. Belief coursed Swansea period began attack purpose. Everton looked little disjointed Swansea added second minutes later. Gylfi Sigurdsson, penalty appeal turned moments Llorente breakthrough goal, delivered cross wide right evaded clutch players ran Mawson, edge six-yard box. Mawson certain score Mason Holgate, Everton right-back, got make superb block. It Swansea turn throw bodies ball second half, prompting Clement praise players magnificent collective effort defensively right result. With matches Swansea safe. Wasps used win Premiership play-offs despite finishing top, tries final quarter kept head table end regular season set semi-final Leicester, finished distant fourth, return bout Saracens. Thomas Young scored tries home side major close-season signings, Kurtley Beale Willie le Roux, means puncture meanest defences. Saracens rested Lions, captain Brad Barritt, wing Chris Ashton scrum-half Richard Wigglesworth Saturday European Champions Cup final Clermont Auvergne, shown below-strength equal weak Northampton weeks ago won 10 previous Premiership matches Wasps, fielded strongest available side. The kick-off delayed 15 minutes 30,000-plus crowd left arrival late. It meant fixtures final round longer synchronised Exeter, contention finish table, having shower game ended. The prolific attack league pitted tightest defence opening minutes offered snapshot season: Wasps took play 15 phases ground Jake Cooper-Woolley took Jim Hamilton long ride Beale, player deceit pick lock, angled run midfield reach Saracens 22, door opened momentarily. Alex Lozowski stopped larger Nathan Hughes head-on conceding centimetre, Schalk Burger upended Danny Cipriani James Haskell held up, Joe Simpson knock-on ended early siege. Wasps, led table year started signs wear, playing zest purpose pronounced spent week listening calling soft showboaters. Saracens team defeat Wasps here, December 2015, beating involves taking opportunities, rarely plentiful. The champions absorbed pressure, waiting counterattack. Young saved Wasps tackled Marcelo Bosch forced centre hold concede penalty, Jimmy Gopperth leaders ahead 35-metre penalty, awarded Titi Lamositele collapsed scrum, try match followed restart. Wasps sloppily conceded lineout 22 Saracens set ruck Ben Spencer spotted instead guarding ruck Tommy Taylor ground clutching left ankle ran gap touch posts. Wasps minutes: Danny Cipriani, restored weeks bench, replicated New Zealand 10s Super Rugby, antidote rush defence dinked kick space. All Young pick ball score. Where Wasps attacked over, prompted elusive Beale, Saracens waited moment. They regained lead 31 minutes Bosch kicked penalty halfway Haskell lured offside Spencer, half turned. Christian Wade kick line went straight play, Saracens wing Sean Maitland body-checked opponent earned yellow card. Gopperth kicked penalty Wasps exploited man advantage just interval Le Roux, hustled Spencer conceding scrum five, created Young second try long pass. It Wasps' 86th Premiership campaign, tournament record, led 16-10 break having lost row injury. They needed cushion Ashley Johnson, Taylor replacement, various dents defence, Le Roux created space left Elliot Daly probably scored Gopperth run him. Gopperth kicking tee unusually inaccurate. He missed penalty 40 metres game  Exeter securing bonus point Gloucester  nervy. Wasps stared play position match threatened come enjoy home advantage sides met play-off semi-final. Wasps needed tries remain table. Beale created first, chip line half-secured Le Roux. The ball fell loose Wade touch record-equalling 17th try league campaign. But Wasps needed Spencer second try checked momentum set date Leicester welcome Saracens  arrived Joe Launchbury stole lineout second-rows chosen ahead Lions, George Kruis, Le Roux freed Daly accelerated away Jamie George Young hat-trick completed ultimately comfortable victory.

Northampton sealed victory thanks try replacement lock Api Ratuniyarawa failure score fourth beat Harlequins seven points means John Kingston finish sixth. Northampton join Europe table, having finished season seventh, Gloucester win Challenge Cup Premiership play-off place. Northampton recent habit losing matches late goes victory ledger, maintain composure mattered. Having finished outside time seven years season, campaign step backwards. To compound matters, Tom Wood hobbled injury rule play-off matches England summer tour Argentina. It disappointing season, said Northampton director rugby, Jim Mallinder. We set standards high club, want finishing fighting play-off places year has happened squad I optimistic season. When Wood went 15 minutes, Northampton 10-0  Harlequins picking left Wasps close-range try captain, James Horwill, converted Nick Evans final appearance club. An Evans penalty extended Harlequins' lead delightful piece skill Harry Mallinder George North, temporarily playing centre, posts. Mallinder converted Northampton ahead Alex Waller plunged rumble offload Louis Picamoles. Mallinder converted.

Harlequins' Charlie Matthews shown yellow card deliberate knock-on forward pass excellent Luther Burrell denied Nafi Tuitavake try right corner. But Northampton lead Ratuniyarawa burrowed Picamoles gone close. Mallinder struck upright simplest conversions try Northampton taken Harlequins sixth place materialise. We lot changes adjustments season I delighted we got substance end year, said Kingston. It trophy, it that club years gives forward with. A 13th semi-final row Leicester, evidently near English game, march resolutely play-offs days, romp confidence yore. This win needed it, chiselled prosaic style, albeit winning increasingly difficult assignment. It unnoticed Worcester outscored tries one. If near English game, peak distant view. Had Freddie Burns kicking boots Leicester lost. Burns finding real form, just prepares leave Bath. Twenty-three points boot saw Tigers home, Ryan Mills, hardly kicked poorly, missed seven points' worth. After try digest sad news Ben Youngs pulling Lions squad family illness, Leicester travel Coventry fortnight Wasps. Their home record starting look formidable ones used compiled Welford Road. And try-scoring rate concern Tigers. Yet play-offs funny business. There belief performance really close winning Wasps, said Matt O'Connor, Leicester head coach. If you game away title. There certain parts game good league. And certain have been. One is, ever, set piece. Graft Worcester backs Leicester forwards ugly. The disparity fives wide Worcester cause problems clearly better set piece. Which shame, because, play not, certainly played. On occasions half Leicester ropes, spill ball heat turned fail quickly enough. But score  beauty was, Ben Te'o putting Wynand Olivier cut, Bryce Heem fed Chris Pennell, went inside line. It timely try, half-hour, Leicester just stretched lead 10 points. Their row experienced, despite young Ellis Genge presence, scrum penalty machine them. But opened try-scoring driven lineout looked far easy, finished Tom Youngs corner. It helped Leicester three-point lead break, Burns immaculate tee, penalty, held lead, courtesy overpowered Worcester scrum. The Warriors, though, briefly lead minutes second half, profiting superiority three-quarters. Of superb signings division, Heem rank smartest. The Kiwi wing quickly spilt high ball vigorous duel Adam Thompstone wide outside, handing opposite man twice, corner. So Leicester tightened screw, dominating territory 25 minutes, Burns added successful kicks, sweet drop goal minutes later retake lead. Worcester fashioned chances. Heem inside ball spilled Alafoti Fa'osiliva line mercy, Warriors division pulled Leicester shape again, Heem involved, Ryan Lamb send Olivier away line. Mills convert touchline Burns sixth penalty kept Leicester ahead entered endgame. It them, defeat turns out. Within reach be, pinnacle English game feels way yet. No trophies dished regular season final day Exeter hunger victory remains insatiable. Whether Chiefs ultimately win title not, entertaining people right end team country currently greater statistical momentum. They entertain Saracens semi-final Sandy Park chasing totally different outcome year Twickenham final. Given Saracens squeeze European Champions' Cup final weekend, wise count Chiefs prematurely. Rob Baxter mastering champions' trick winning entirely best depleted injuries lost league October. While Baxter acknowledges scale challenge  Everyone knows good Saracens are; potentially playing best team Europe  squad long ago ceased overawed anyone. Baxter felt difference kick-off Ricoh Arena delayed, giving Wasps advantage knowing precisely needed table. In final analysis joyous trip Devonian dreamland: maximum bonus point win record eighth match succession secured home semi-final absence Dave Ewers, Henry Slade Thomas Waldrom. These hard-working, relentless Chiefs bunch fly-by-night chancers. The crucial 69th-minute try scored replacement scrum-half Will Chudley, instance, 86th try Exeter scored prolific seasons. A dominant Saracens finished table 80 points year, points clear field, scored 60 tries 580 points. Exeter exceeded single marks time, achievement given sluggish start campaign. If rode luck occasions madcap game oval-shaped pinball, disputing ceaseless endeavour collective pride extracts trouble weekly basis. Gloucester defended hard ran harder occasions; Chiefs, 15-6 half, soaked repeatedly hit hosts counter, growing stronger confident longer game went on. Gloucester season, start finish, litany what-ifs: team beat France team, La Rochelle, away home reach Friday European Challenge Cup final looked irresistible opening hour league game Leicester September displayed true colours enough. They started like greyhounds here, contributing fully blistering quarter stretching Chiefs defence wide create final early try flanker Lewis Ludlam. When lurking Jonny May picked Gareth Steenson pass cruised 65 metres score end, Chiefs option dig deep again. This sixth game row Exeter conceded interception try, price paid constant gainline positivity, won occasion. It help Cherry White defence, impressive lengthy periods, slackened momentarily allow Ian Whitten carve straight softish defence score posts reduce interval deficit 15-13. If game pace cranked notch, sides determined end regular campaign style. Had knock-on build-up, May contender finish season soared England team-mate Jack Nowell, Chiefs work way upfield replacement Sam Simmonds prop Ben Moon left corner flag. James Short Chudley duly secured bonus point, cancelling May second score end. The quarter, recent months, case Chiefs showing opponents boss. Pep Guardiola paid tribute captain, Vincent Kompany, Manchester City biggest league win season, completing fifth successive game popping important goal start second half 5-0 win Crystal Palace.

Bournemouth hit Junior Stanislas Shawcross goal ensured midtable sides shared spoils. When Stoke finally score away goal courtesy players. Instead, Bournemouth forward Mousset net, unwittingly placing backwards header past goalkeeper, Artur Boruc, following Marko Arnautovic corner. The home unlucky fall behind, especially Adam Smith fine early effort concluded best half, full-back blasting post 18 yards superb reverse flick Stanislas. Harry Arter fortunate escape red card two-footed lunge Joe Allen, contact ball just field. Arnautovic underscored Stoke tribulations goal heading yards unmarked, having picked Allen neat cross.

David Moyes recently asked felt shown up Marco Silva impressive stewardship Hull City. Sunderland manager gave bland answer, flintiness eyes suggested inwardly seething particularly keen end east Yorkshire counterpart proud record having lost home league game Portugal, Greece England March 2014. Thanks amalgam Jordan Pickford heroics goal Hull failure cope pressure suddenly expected team control, Moyes shattered Silva record significantly increased prospect Hull joining Sunderland Championship season. With awkward fixtures Crystal Palace home Tottenham Hotspur ahead, hope suddenly unexpectedly dwindling resource Humber, especially Swansea win Everton. Losing today good us, said Silva, thought Hull merited penalty. I knew was easy game Sunderland came prove something. I believe we'd scored won did play well. Our team played big tension us. It good moment it moment calm. Today were calm, tried fast. If do play calm, it impossible play well. David Moyes, Wearside future remains uncertain, somewhat brighter-eyed: I definitely wish happened weeks ago we playing win coming, said. The players showed pride performance. George Honeyman really given Sunderland early lead young midfielder  decent  headed wide connecting Billy Jones inviting cross Jermain Defoe decoy run distracted Hull defence. Cheered convalescent midfielder Ryan Mason  KCom time fracturing skull Chelsea January  Silva ominously shaky start. Accustomed sitting home hurting visitors counter-attack, supposed dominant entirely got hang it. Almost imperceptibly uncertainty spread initially noisy home crowd, prompting chants Is library? Sunderland large, vocal surprisingly cheerful, travelling support. Not time season Sam Clucas Hull player, bar menacing Kamil Grosicki, recalibrate mood. Invariably integral team better manoeuvres, Clucas proved conduit play flowed. Fittingly low volley stretched Pickford absolute limit wake Grosicki sashay past Billy Jones clever cross. With Harry Maguire subsequently shooting inches wide Pablo Hernndez changing pace surging Javier Manquillo bending left-foot shot past far post, Silva improved looked exactly secure back. Clucas needed watch step collecting booking fouling Didier Ndong retained sufficient cool whisk ball Defoe toecaps England striker threatened end recent goal drought. Eldin Jakupovic, late penalty save previous weekend earned Hull point Southampton sent Sunderland down, similarly repel Defoe shot end rapid Sunderland break Pickford intervention just prevented Alfred N'Diaye heading Grosicki cross him. Pickford wonderful reflexes brilliant footwork coveted host leading clubs emphasised ability fabulous fingertip save steered Lazar Markovic header safety Liverpool loanee met Ahmed Elmohamady pinpoint cross. If Jordan leaves summer, big price, said Moyes. A really, really big price. As John O'Shea sliding interception forced Hernndez shooting wide, Hull fans grew despondent. The previously real prospect bright Premier League future dimming passing minute lights nearly going completely Jones stunned sets supporters giving Sunderland lead. Demonstrating remains useful ends, O'Shea flicked Honeyman corner, enabling Jones power diving, six-yard header post. If Grosicki uncomfortable relocation left right following injury Markovic suited Sunderland, Moyes required Pickford preserve side lead. A particularly outstanding one-handed save deny Hernndez probably pushed value couple million. By alternately disconsolate frantic, Silva replaced midfielder striker, swapping N'Diaye Dieumerci Mbokani but, once, customary boldness rebounded Defoe scored late, arguably offside, close-range, second Sunderland. My home record is important, said Hull manager. But result is. Sam Vokes second-half double denied West Brom away victory 2017 earned Burnley draw confirmed Premier League survival.

Do worry, mint juleps bourbon there, joked heading protest freezing rain. Nunes led group half dozen Mijenete activists dressed dark green sashes prizewinning horses Derby wear. They handed flyers calling Louisville sanctuary city. The normally festive parade turned mess ponchos crying children. But despite cold weather, crowd reaction flyers, featuring mint julep calling activists #CrushIce, appeared warm. Activists Mijente said Derby marked time state economic elite addressed issue immigration. It hypocritical, said Jesus Ibanez. We glad concerned individuals working horse stalls, happening city, say nothing. Ibanez said Trump taken office, approximately 100 undocumented immigrants arrested raids Louisville area. He described fear community amid stories mothers arrested walking children school. My God, I getting calls left right families taking kids school, said Ibanez. They were going outside homes.

The 21 goals 11 assists provided Denmark striker Nicolai Jorgensen proved invaluable employs traditional 4-3-3 Dutch system, emphasis firmly attacking. In July, chairman announced hoping win title year, goal season qualify Europe, recalls NRC Handelsblad journalist Feyenoord supporter, Mark Lievisse Adriaanse. Everyone saying: Yeah, sure, winning title: look season. You finished lost seven games row chance winning title year.' So expected this. They dominated league table day feels like wave suffering falling 18 years waiting. This probably beautiful league title club won suffering hard. We bankrupt, lost 10-0 competitors years. That 10-0 defeat PSV Eindhoven October 2010 proved watershed. With club mired 40m debt, humiliating result proud history 1970 European Cup winners hastened arrival Martin van Geel replace Leo Beenhakker technical director. One acts sack coach, Mario Been, end season replace Ronald Koeman, work leaving AZ Alkmaar 18 months earlier. At time Feyenoord young was different team lost 10-0, remembers Lievisse Adriaanse. Players like Stefan Vrij, Georginio Wijnaldum, Leroy Fer Bruno Martins Indi started come Koeman introduced professional attitude meant accept losses small influences club blocked progress. Hiring important process Van Geel lot credit that. But hand hired Fred Rutten, successful. When left 2015, candidate job Van Bronkhorst. Despite spending years assistant Koeman Rutten, coincidentally charge PSV 10-0 defeat, Rangers Arsenal midfielder unexpected choice. But Konterman believes appointment Holland midfielders Jan Wouters Jean-Paul van Gastel, club captain 1999, backroom staff masterstroke. Giovanni surprised me, says Konterman. I played Rangers Holland eyes was leader. What doing fantastic organise strong team him. The combination three, different characters, influential. There lot pressure group, especially weeks, difficult handle that. So experience players like Kuyt El Ahmadi crucial. In particular, transformation midfielder Tonny Vilhena caught eye. Having burst team Koeman teenager, appeared way club refusing sign new contract falling favour Van Bronkhorst. Lucrative moves Leicester Milan table 22-year-old dramatic U-turn ensured remained club joined 15 years earlier. Everyone surprised stayed. But important thing mother cancer did want leave her, says Lievisse Adriaanse. He knew went overseas chance much. He star players year. A couple years ago criticism selfish problems he vanished. In Netherlands we used having teenagers team it usual period break it difficult. Vilhena commitment cause underlined week agreed contract extension 2020, rising stars Terence Kongolo Emil Hansson following suit prepare season Champions League group stages.

A lot boys 1999 internationals used big games. There Dutch players teams  players Argentina, Russia, Brazil Poland I think reflects fact Eredivisie feeder league. We know place Europe means teams young players end going England Spain earn big money. It nice want strong league ca compete TV money countries. For now, though, focus firmly Sunday. Defeat Excelsior Ajax sniff overhauling Feyenoord summit but, match Heracles De Kuip come week, surely blow time. The significance Rotterdam huge, says Lievisse Adriaanse. I 1999 I do remember league title. For generation supporters, experiencing happening right time. I do really know feel. The whining noise coming direction Old Trafford steadily audible recent weeks, Jos Mourinho mixing traditional gripes exhaustion fixture overload inventive new ones occur managers, complaining injured players lack competitive drive return quickly. By rights member Manchester United put-upon line doing moaning. Luke Shaw treated mistrust outright dissatisfaction season, sympathy manager ligament damage forced field Swansea. In urging Phil Jones Chris Smalling ignore toe leg injuries club need central defenders first, Mourinho raised eyebrows medical specialists sent public message little confidence Daley Blind ability cover. Blind specialist centre-half  just position necessary  Dutch international United consistent performers season, managed himself fit busy April. Does Mourinho value contribution versatility? Not tell public pronouncements. Blind simply joins list players  Anthony Martial, Henrikh Mkhitaryan, Matteo Darmian Wayne Rooney  confidence undermined manager words actions season. This reason Mourinho tended stay club seasons. That appear recommended dose manager players warm irritating. Any longer cons tend outweigh pros, scapegoats begin outnumber favourites. Mourinho can, does, ridicule Arsne Wenger specialist failure dweller past, decades club United manager going approach. He say wish to, course, theory coach best relatively short period time parties begin need new stimulus, let forget Sir Alex Ferguson longer United. Staying course 20 years necessarily recipe underachievement supporter unrest, just happens require adaptability emollience Mourinho does possess. Even Mourinho prepared battle oldest rival England, complaining does accumulative tiredness force make changes Emirates, difference attitude managers noticeable. Wenger, lower table real danger missing Champions League time century, perfectly chipper positive. Mourinho, victory Celta Vigo, unhappy finishing, result injury situation, just fact application Marcus Rashford. So, going match probably decide United finish Arsenal, good season Old Trafford not? Moaning Mourinho modus operandi, United manager actually got complain about, managers happily swap places? United make four. That hard normally, Mourinho players took Europa League seriously start means Champions League qualification insurance. It long draining competition bulk them; United falter claim second trophy season Stockholm 24 May. Mourinho says players suffering having play games else. To extent true, United know better most, price success. Stay European competition closing stages games mount up. Playing 10 games April new United workload semi-finalists year Champions League. United lost key players injury. They unlucky certain areas, notably losing Zlatan Ibrahimovic Marcos Rojo knee injuries time, Mourinho does biggest capable squads disposal. His cover centre-half includes Eric Bailly Blind, Smalling available again, Martial Rashford exciting young forwards Premier League. Rooney Ibrahimovic partnership likely work, view age mobility pair, important remember United dominating games scoring goals necessary kill opponents long Ibrahimovic ruled season. Mourinho needs penetration end product Mkhitaryan, Juan Mata Jesse Lingard season, buy type player score 20 goals. At moment Antoine Griezmann Kylian Mbapp mentioned quite transfer targets United clubs raise money. United overstretched going play team kids Arsenal best chance reaching Europa League final. Some managers clubs consider that, club probably not. United standards, all, does Mourinho. He lose competitive game Wenger dozen encounters, offer head plate. United come second best travel Spurs Sunday 14 May, near trouble start making life easy Arsenal. Why mess? Simple, really  ludicrous decision sack Gary Rowett December replace Gianfranco Zola. At time Rowett departure, Birmingham seventh, outside play-offs goal difference. By time Zola fell sword, months later, Birmingham slumped 20th, points relegation places. Zola appointment showed happens owners directors seduced name. Panos Pavlakis, influential club director, talked Zola pedigree, philosophy ambition asked Birmingham supporters trust judgment board sought move new direction. That direction downhill. Fast. Did coming? Birmingham owners Hong Kong did, that sure. Neither Pavlakis, said appointing Zola enable Birmingham fans embrace future begin implement exciting vision Trillion Trophy Asia [the club owners]. Alarm bells ringing early  Zola, brand possession-based football looked like working, failed win 10 games charge. Yet inconceivable Birmingham, healthy point haul half season, sucked survival scrap. By time Derby, managed Rowett, won St Andrew 8 April, threat relegation loomed large. Zola resigned days later, prompting Birmingham turn Harry Redknapp. How damaging relegation be? Armageddon word Lee Clark used years ago sum relegation League One mean Birmingham side. They ended surviving final day, courtesy injury-time equaliser Bolton, good reason concerned wider ramifications relegation time, given Carson Yeung, club chairman, just imprisoned money laundering. The situation dire now, plenty uncertainty surrounding club. Birmingham supporters know Trillion Trophy Asia people fate club hands. Relegation thing Birmingham needs. Can bounce straight away? They 1995. Barry Fry season charge, following relegation, culminated promotion tier champions. Redknapp, however, highly unlikely stay manager Birmingham slide League One and, bearing mind happened Zola, owners trusted identify right man bring club Championship? And money there, mid-90s David Sullivan David Gold helm, fund signings needed return attempt? Stuart James Why mess? One word: Venky. It approaching seven years Indian chicken processing company bought established, well-run Premier League club Jack Walker Trust. Apart two-year period relative stability Gary Bowyer  achieved transfer embargo Championship  Pune-based owners overseen steady fear terminal decline proud, historic club. Their ruinous ownership included series managerial mistakes, lack communication supporters executives, excessive contracts paid players longer Rovers, selling assets playing staff rising debt. And that just brief summation. Did coming? A second relegation Venky watch come surprise bar owners, issue occasional statement wishing retain club restore Premier League reducing investment playing squad. In transfer windows alone, Blackburn raised 27.8m selling Jordan Rhodes, Grant Hanley, Rudy Gestede, Shane Duffy Tom Cairney, spent merely 250,000 new signing, Derrick Williams. The arrivals free transfers loans. Several supporters groups formed protest Venky warned inevitability relegation  worse  turning ire Football Association allowing so-called fit-and-proper owners wreak havoc. Attendance figures reflect level disenchantment. Ewood Park lowest attendance-to-capacity percentage Championship season  38.9%  witnessed smallest league crowd 25 years December: 9,976 Brighton. How damaging relegation be? Administration fear Ewood seasons drop League One bring threat closer. As Venky, uncertainty confusion reigns. Paul Senior ruled prospect administration appointed director footballing operations January. At club biannual meeting supporters March  Venky supposed liaison, Suhail Pasha, bothered attend  Rovers' finance director, Mike Cheston, assurances. Blackburn debt stands 100m, parachute payments Premier League stopped start season and, despite fit-and-proper owners having fund club, Rovers required short-term loans working capital recent years. As majority debt 87m loan Venky, administration appear damaging path club owners alike. Can bounce straight away? Tony Mowbray restored solidity hope Blackburn replacing Owen Coyle February summer upheaval beckons survival achieved not. Several first-team regulars contract club saleable assets departed, continued spiral. An immediate return tall order manager meagre budget expected cut further. Andy Hunter Why mess? It goes club erratic ownership Fawaz al-Hasawi. Under Kuwaiti, Forest getting progressively worse season, permanent managers interim appointments years. Forest full-time chief executive Hasawi 58 months owner. There chief scout and, recently, director football real structure. There skeleton staff, general sense decay Hasawi, director, game City Ground September. Forest, meanwhile, Nottingham Evening Post describes standing appointment high court, referring unpaid tax bills winding-up orders. Players missed wages talked going strike. It chaotic, fractured club, desperately need expertise. Did coming? Forest finished eighth Hasawi year, notable sacking Sean O'Driscoll 4-2 win Leeds left team just outside play-offs. The following year 11th, 14th season 16th. See trend? They manager current season and, laughably, point people charge decided try luring Chris Hughton away Brighton. Nigel Clough want work Hasawi talked days ago father disliked way Forest run. Paul Heckingbottom, manager Barnsley, candidate  until, is, described Forest no-go zone sensible member profession. What point going is? asked. Mark Warburton, fortunately Forest, fussy turn shrewd appointment, having lined club prospective new owners. How damaging relegation be? Forest supporters accused living past references glory years Brian Clough memories losing Yeovil  fact, conceding home Yeovil  League One play-offs 2007 there, too. The time club dropped League One, 2005, took seasons up. But worse position terms infrastructure awful lot work needs scenes. On brighter front, Gary Brazil outstanding work charge academy seen number highly rated youngsters breaking team. Without academy graduates  look Ben Brereton particular  Forest probably already. Can bounce straight away? In January, Hasawi verge selling club American businessmen provisionally place new structure Gary Rowett taking manager, Paul Mitchell joining Tottenham sporting director major work planned stadium surrounding area. Lo behold, Hasawi decided not think deal best club proper explanation. Four months on, Evangelos Marinakis inheriting League One club if, expected, Olympiakos owner completes takeover. Marinakis dubious reputation Forest fans delighted just current owner. As hapless Hasawi said himself, replacement certainly more professional.

As young girl, told mother going win gold medal boxing Olympics. It was ambition crazy fantasy: women boxing was Olympic sport time. But sure enough, Adams went woman win gold, London Olympics. Four years later, Rio, wept won gold again, British boxer retain Olympic title 1924. She hero  boxer (technically gifted balletic, dances like pint-sized Muhammad Ali), accidental role model (the lack fuss revealed bisexual), life force (that luminous smile). We meet south London photographer studio, just days professional fight. Adams won bout; just got engaged girlfriend, Mexican-American boxer Marlen Esparza, living sun-blushed life San Francisco. Things better. Perhaps ready confront unhappiest periods life. Esparza today, advising photoshoot, telling hot looks. The pair deliriously love; theirs romantic stories history boxing. In new autobiography, Believe, Adams says introduced Esparza, taken speak  second time met. The time, could stop talking. While Adams having photograph taken, Esparza tells true; met thought Adams plain weird. But long. Esparza 27, seven years younger Adams, tells me, I lot meaner Nicky. People lot quicker, looks approachable. But comes people does know, gets really nervous. She socially awkward. Does realise that? Not really. I say, You self-conscious', she No, I just feel weird.' If point flaw, does recognise it. She likes things optimistic way, I like things realistic way. When Adams sits me, I Esparza means. Adams looks distance, answers terse monosyllables  aggressively, just self-consciously. But suddenly relaxes, contrast extreme: direct eye-contact, answers, engaged, surprising. In fact, turns open people I met. The young Nicola frail little thing, waylaid asthma, allergies, eczema. When five, doctor told mother better let run around, lest trigger asthma. Adams was having it: Try tell five-year-old kid ca run down. It pretty impossible, says hard, flat Yorkshire accent. Adams said fluked way boxing. When 12, mother, Dee, went aerobics class and, wanting leave children home (her babysitter cancelled), took gym. It just happened children boxing class day, Nicola fancied  that. She told anybody listen Olympic boxer. Few took seriously. Although women boxing goes 18th century, appeared 1904 Olympics demonstration bout, introduced Olympic sport 2012. In England banned century, grounds premenstrual syndrome women unstable box. It was November 1996 Amateur Boxing Association England controversially voted favour lifting ban, allowing girls young 10 compete spar gyms. Adams fight year ban lifted, aged 13, working men club Leeds. She won, did fight years: simply were girls fight. Surely tempted up? Naaah. She grins. I enjoyed training. I'd guys support competing. It used frustrated sometimes, I wanted ring. Did fight boys? No. I used spar boys, I was allowed box them. As talk, emerges that, chance start boxing, Adams profound motivation. In chapter memoir tellingly entitled Round 1, writes parents separated 11, mother had lot. She describes incident happened parents arguing. I just wanted them, I jumped mum tried protect plastic sword. I thought I dad away. My mum reckons that, then, I brave. From age eight, says, begged mother leave father; years later, did. My dad hitting mum I trying hit plastic sword protect Why desperate mother leave? I knew was happy unhappy well. She bubbly, joyful person. I did like way I seeing treated. In book, says hoped father, Innocent, change learn, did. What need learn? I guess just better person, nicer mum. Adams looking middle distance. Was father violent mother? Yes. My dad hitting mum I trying hit plastic sword protect her. And hit Nicola? Yes. Just odd slap there. But I concerned mum. I tried fight back, I bit small. She looks me, smile luminous. There doubt hero book, life, is: Dee. In early years, Adams' family comfortably off. Both parents working (her father plasterer, mother restaurant manager), summer left Leeds spend weeks New York relatives. Adams talks moved new estate mother left father; mother took jobs, working day night make ends meet; mother black uniform went grey rewashing. She worked, different times, manager jewellery company, restaurant, hairdresser. However tough was, Adams says family life transformed. The (Dee, Adams, younger brother Kurtis) closer unit. We started laughing, joking. Had hard laugh before? Yeah, tough did want trouble everybody tiptoeing around. Would father warning? Yes. Did drink? No, lot  just really controlling. My mum would allowed friends. While times missed father, Adams says relieved mother finally gathered courage make fresh start. She understands hard leave, describing situation the person controlling feel ca, feel they mentally strong things own. Did father scare little girl? Yes. He huge. He big more, though. She laughs. I bet were laughing then, I say. No, scary. I ask campaign domestic violence. Yeah, I'd love work that. A year parents separated, Adams started boxing. Does think things other? I do know, says. I really thought way. I quite strong-minded. Maybe did. At time, I enjoyed boxing place I escape. All kids gym problems, place did think them. Before father left, Adams enjoyed watching classic matches television. Does deserve credit success? She thinks long hard. I do know, mum had taken mistake I would thought second I going boxer. She reason I ended boxing. At age 14, family crisis. Dee contracted meningitis died. Adams called ambulance mother barely walk, speech slurred. And Adams demanded urgent left hours hospital. By then, Dee remember date birth children had. When hospital eventually carried tests, Adams says, discovered mother brain begun shut down; couple hours live. Dee recovery slow laborious. Twenty years on, suffers after-effects, recovered, Adams look herself brother. This grew up; word uses repeatedly herself period strong. The time wept private. I myself hospital cafeteria I just broke down. I did let brother cry, I did want think things really bad. I stayed strong him. And I stay strong Mum. To complicate matters, age 15, Adams diagnosed attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. As always, tries positive. I think it helped training. I tired. I got energy. It helps shots. I trying new things. When ADHD, start million things, it hard focus just finish thing Sitting nearby, Esparza looks phone laughs. I know I bored, I know she going do. It hard her. Is Adams calmer days? Well, I Adderall, I focused. I stopped bit, went again. When ADHD start million things, it hard focus just finish thing. The Adderall helps. I ask worked hard school. Only classes I liked, like science maths. She said favourite book Freakonomics, Steven Levitt Stephen J Dubner study economics based principle incentives. Adams lights like pinball machine I mention it. She smiles eyes, cheeks nose. Even ears smile. I really like book explains economics fun way. Let think example. Like, drug dealers basically make money people working McDonald. She stops corrects herself. That SuperFreakonomics, second one. Is big reader? I read Bill Bryson History Of Nearly Everything. I liked that. What else? The God Delusion, Richard Dawkins book. Blimey, I say  you Christian, are you? She grins. Yeah. I intrigued. I like trying understand different views perceptions. There bits makes question things. You think: That good point.' So Dawkins convert her? Nah. I hanging side! At school, talented sprinter, running 100m 200m Leeds teenager. She career running, was taken boxing. At 17, got chance box second time, Babyface Adams, winning knockout second round. There fights Britain, travelled Europe spar compete. In 2001, woman boxer represent England. In 2003, aged 20, English amateur champion. Adams studying  business studies, physical education software development college, BTec sports science Hopwood Hall Rochdale. The main reason went Hopwood Hall boxing coach Alwyn Belcher worked there: desperate turn champ. Like men came across, reluctant train woman, 2007 coached silver medal European Championships. A year later, won silver World Championships China. The attitude women boxers primitive. There little funding, hopeless facilities, respect. Adams says female boxers treated like kind novelty act Britain Got Talent. In book, describes girl finish boxing hand shorts, dripping sweat, girl fight in. That 2008, says today, year won silver World Championships. It shocking. You'd think 1950s something. Adams keen actor, subsidised herself appearing extra TV shows, including Waterloo Road Coronation Street. She hoped women boxing introduced Olympic sport 2008, was be. In fact, 2008 proved disastrous year. She slipped boxing bandage, fell downstairs cracked vertebra back. For months, wear body cast moulded half body, agony, bored silly. She did box year. But August 2009, given best incentive fit announced women boxing going included Olympics. And 2012, danced, jabbed clubbed way gold flyweight final, crowd 10,000, outclassing great rival, China Ren Cancan (Cancan beaten finals 2010 2012 World Championships, beating Esparza Olympic semi-final). It great moments London 2012: crowd roaring loudly could hear commentary, Adams punching air triumphantly end, history made. After parents separated, Adams, mother brother close unit. 'We started laughing again' Adams clear gold medal for, does today. It mum. I promised I going best. So shocked father turned family area afterwards. I bit angry, tournaments I to? But you going for, it Olympics. Did tell leave? No, I did want spoil mood. Had supported way left? I got occasional birthday Christmas present. I stopped accepting long 2012. I do now. The turning point came, says, phone conversation soon victory. I said, Just apologise way mum me.' And did admit happened past, I like, OK, that it, I done.' I angry. Really angry.' That contact? Yes. Then messaged say good luck Rio. And it like, Commonwealth Games, Europeans, World Championships tournaments I past years? What good luck qualifiers? When I asked comment, Innocent Adams confirmed refused apologise daughter ex-wife, did feel apologise for. The allegations completely false, said. I violent ex-wife Nicola. This just defamation good character. Dee Adams stands daughter version events. Now Adams plans Britain female professional world champion, boxing the Lioness. She managed Frank Warren, years ago said, I do like women boxing. Never have, will. Why agreed represented dinosaur? Simple, says. He seen light. He totally come round us. I meeting him, did shy away he'd said past. He said, Seeing compete years changed mind.' He thinks I really big things pros. He believes I want women boxing  level men. I'd love able headline Vegas MGM. In words, he businessman finally realised marketable? She grins. Exactly. Does enjoy boxing used to? Yes! says, starts talking joy boxing, it hard stop her. It sports you finished article. There learn; new  faster, stronger, technical. That I enjoy most. In boxing, does matter speed goes little bit. Take Canelo [Alvarez] Floyd Mayweather fought. You really young strong, older lot skilful, just smarts outmanoeuvre younger guy. Does buzz like boxing? She looks Esparza. The thing gives adrenaline driving race tracks. She going swap boxing Formula One? Esparza shakes head furiously. She going racing driver, says. Because it dangerous, unrealistic? Cos it dangerous. She'd she'd probably good it, she going it. You ca control car like think can. She looks Adams. We talked this. Adams hooting laughter. Esparza has finished. She kind person who, fun wants it, does it. That I like her. But that. I said her, I climb Mount Everest. One danger another. And said that. But surely boxing dangerous? There danger sport, Adams says, and it you happy risks involved, I happy. The thing learn hit.'' I'd love headline Las Vegas. There learn: faster, stronger Now boxing professionally, fighting time headguard. Does fear punch head? Nah, that boxing. You shower, you going wet. And it lot easier. The helmet blocks peripheral vision. Now, I everything. Plus head smaller target now. Adams Esparza just year, alternate Adams' home Leeds Esparza San Francisco. Where does prefer? I like weather. In Leeds? San Francisco! We train there. She thinks permanently. I ask Adams Esparza changed her. Yes, I happier  possible. She laughs. I thought happy someone. I just thought saw movies. I thought, Really? Nobody actually loves somebody like  it just far!' But I know movies true. Is true Esparza men before? Yes, says. But Nicky just shame. Would fight other? No way, say simultaneously. They expected past, fought weight division  Esparza weight lower. They talk different boxers. I aggressive, Esparza says. There lot going time fights. She counter-puncher, lets people come her. I more: I going come you.' Who win fight? Do know, chorus. I ask Adams ultimate ambition boxer is. I want remembered greatest, just like hero, Muhammad Ali. Has Esparza got say that? About best ever? I pretty sure I be. I be. I do reason. They look laugh. We rivalry going best, Adams says. It elephant relationship, Esparza says. At 34, Adams thinks peak. There going life: wedding plan, new book, acting career ground. She knows got work cut going remembered greatest female boxer ever. But Adams knack realising dreams. My new life started I 12, long parents split up, that I discovered boxing. My mum went aerobics class, Kurtis I waited gym outside, happened boxing gym. I remember looking taken aback. The super-heavyweights pounding away bags, people sparring other. It proper, old-school, Rocky-style gym, steamed-up windows peeling paint. I instantly fell love place. I stood thought, This like Muhammad Ali starting out.' Ali big idol mine, I used watch fights TV dad. But I had imagined minute I day. That day, I choice sitting getting involved boxing. The coach, Steve Franks, asked I fancied giving go, I thought, Why not?' The thing got punching pads, just felt right I wanted more. When I got home night I could stop talking begged mum back. The gym ran junior boxing club after-school club. The I went, hooked I got. I felt like people understood me. Over couple weeks I learned shadow-box; I soon perfected stance started learning jab. I did think fact male environment I young girl. Steve said, really early on, gym was male female  just boxing gym. He rule listened him. One day took mum aside told thought I real potential. My competitive match took place working men club Leeds I 13 When I turned 13, Mum started letting gym own. I spar guys lot quite I gave good run money. My brother started boxing bit I used spar sometimes, I loved. He thought beat me: way. None female friends boxed, I soon friends gym. I did big deal, mates, male female, did, either. Maybe I'd started later strange, 12 do analyse things. You follow heart. My competitive match took place working men club Leeds I 13. My family came watch I excited I kept peeping curtains look audience. Steve wanted conserve energy match, I just wanted ring people I do. I chose Ini Kamoze Here Comes Hotstepper walk to.

I was scared getting hit I'd boxing year I knew that, happen, I'd stride. I think time people club seen girl box, I imagined carry drinking pints chatting but, amazingly, paid attention.

When man tired London, well, there probably fair chance Tottenham fan early May. On chilly, noisy night inside London Stadium Spurs entered derby game hoping apply pressure Chelsea shoulder knowing forfeit league title, too, losing game. And came pass: boisterous night May, wild, fingernail-gnawing London derby defeat. Almost exactly year ago wild draw Chelsea seen Spurs ghost season title challenge. Here goal bitty game decorated heavy tackles came Manuel Lanzini 65 minutes. Defeat means Chelsea win title time week victories Middlesbrough West Brom. The race tipped, inexorably, Antonio Conte side. It generally London-centred affair Mauricio Pochettino young team seasons. Arsenal hauled weekend, significant marker. Indeed, Tottenham crowned game kings London newspaper, status earnt fine record derby matches, although, sadly fans, actually topping table ahead Chelsea point. With West Ham paddling near bottom, Spurs expected muscle way match en route urgent engagements. Somehow quite looked like happening West Ham played throughout, solid spiky deep defence finding unexpected space Tottenham backline. It engrossing spectacle minutes ticked away. This violent game too. Kyle Walker booked early stamp-tackle. Mark Noble booked hack Eric Dier shins red. Hugo Lloris, unlikely enforcer, went Lanzini edge box received traditional goalkeeper pardon. Cheikhou Kouyat sent sprawling rolls loose green matting goal foul Walker. It vigorous contrast oddly atmosphere kick-off bizarro Bladerunner-ish stadium, beamed East London like visitation future consumer dystopia. Inside, however, West Ham fans generate great wave noise, half-time game bruising bitty. Dele Alli, incisive Arsenal, quiet. Son Heung-min came closest low shot right Adrin palmed away. Somehow goal coming end. The decisive came left, Aaron Cresswell making ground crossing. The ball bobbled Lanzini, lashed corner, capping excellent, scuttling game. Eight Argentinian 10 goals come London derbies. At final whistle lopsided spaceship stadium erupted West Ham joy, London voices  Spurs ones  raised sharp end things. Pochettino little flat quietly magnanimous. What exactly here? Some suggest collective failure will, bottle job, ridiculously harsh. Spurs excellent mattered Arsenal days ago. This young team. They back. Although obvious areas improve. If Son caught eye zippy movement, highlighted Spurs' real failing: lack extreme speed attack, sameness movements. Moussa Sissoko addressed this, disappointing footballer given mooching looking splendid applying athleticism cause. Sissoko flags slight area slackness. Poor recruitment summer help. Vincent Janssen necessary standard yet. One does wonder useful Jermain Defoe back-up season, extra points dredged up, starter hard imagine obviously Poch-style player. Even Christian Eriksen offered hope decent performance head, including pass half just centre circle, clipping ball tiniest channels set Harry Kane away. Eriksen touches attacking player Premier League season Gylfi Sigurdsson Alexis Snchez title productive attacking midfielder division. Again, though, area strength Spurs look strengthen further, dimension team settle rhythms wear opponents home steamrollering force away. At point enter final area concern. Defeat misshapen cantilevered bowl, Penrose stairs stadium wrong angle, half-expects look players running straight air, 45-degree angle sky, came odd sense foreboding Who knows, season Wembley, away comfort White Hart Lane tight angles, good thing, drawing gears evolving team.

Mauricio Pochettino lamented Tottenham Hotspur inability seize opportunity spook Chelsea Premier League, saying team 1-0 defeat West Ham Friday night suggested lacked instincts champions. A victory Spurs cut Chelsea lead table single point Manuel Lanzini winning goal West Ham leaves Antonio Conte men points clear game hand nearest pursuers. They secure title beat Middlesbrough Stamford Bridge Monday West Bromwich Albion The Hawthorns Friday. To win league trophy key moments, said Pochettino. The match West Ham] key moment ... want champions win. How, I do know. We missing little bit try finish season best way, fighting. Tottenham midfielder Eric Dier admitted team title aspirations highly unrealistic. It disappointing, said 23-year-old. We knew going tough long time ago managed bring points. After [this defeat] it nearly impossible. But games season, matter what. Pochettino admitted team failedto reach level attained winning previous matches league, describing team performance just OK. He said, however, remains proud challenge team season. It was best performance, tried, said. I do change vision team. I proud. It difficult level. When conceded, [West Ham] played deeper, [it was] difficult create chances. We miss little bit fluidity play possession ball quick try space break down. In end I calm, disappointed like players, on. Pochetino said decision omit Mousa Dembl starting line-up contribute team defeat. Dier Victor Wanyama began central midfield four, Dembl arriving second half, just victory Arsenal weekend. Our strength collective, squad, said Pochettino. With Mousa lost won. Football name, player. It strong like unit. Mousa bring things team like player I do think playing player another. West Ham manager, Slaven Bilic, said team produced best performances season secure win banishes relegation fears relieves pressure him. We deserved win, everything, said. The way magnificent. Great determination, thinking individual do. But beat team like Spurs need showed quality, especially second half. Friday night, underthe lights, them, big game them. You ca beat feeling. Last-day drama new Tony Mowbray, having kept Coventry City League One win final day season Crawley Town years ago, Blackburn Rovers manager remembers surprisingly little it. All I bring mind I trying substitute second half analyst jumping stand trying attract attention heard game radio, Mowbray recalls. I could work wanted make substitution that happens there going  bit blur. To avoid similar confusion Brentford Sunday Mowbray plans touch events games involving relegation rivals Birmingham City Nottingham Forest, worked response given contingency. We need Plan A, Plan B Plan C, says. But hopefully once. The Middlesbrough, West Bromwich Albion Celtic manager exactly position before, fairly certain 2015 Coventry victory send Crawley down, did. This time, Blackburn win relegated. On hand, depending results elsewhere, draw up. Mowbray bottom, level points Forest, immediately goal difference superior one. Birmingham points ahead. There outside chance lose stay up; that tight is, Mowbray says. Theoretically beat fans jumping likely need win certain number goals. You ca leave things chance Forest winning single goal, we need thinking sending extra striker try more. If teams losing doing right, I try tight. The worst-case scenario hear Birmingham winning four-nil Forest scored leave needing seven. The situation quite tense wholesale changes Huddersfield Town Birmingham weekend, allowed Harry Redknapp team unexpected points. Like managers, Mowbray sides argument. I do blame David Wagner doing thinks best side, says. Huddersfield play-offs I think lot managers position. That does make easier though. It magic dust Harry brings team wins 23 games suddenly able win 2-0 10 men. Mowbray arrived Blackburn 10 weeks remaining season 14 games suffered defeats, freely admits victories. When really need run wins  that thing catapult table, says. Winning boosts everyone confidence draw game slips away sucked in. Blackburn steady decline club owners decided Sam Allardyce. Mowbray come particular criticism club itself League One happy stay manager, sigh exasperated gesture extremely well-appointed training facilities view window, points obvious. This club infrastructure place bigger, says. I saying good League One, Forest double European Cup winners trouble too, reality hits, look eye. I know League One I Coventry. It really tough going places like Bury Rochdale Tuesday night. Should worst come worst, savings made, salaries reduced, mistake let quality go. You dilute playing strength back. If League One obviously reduced budget I like think bigger better ones division. In event relegation, Mowbray making point Venky Group representatives. The manager little direct contact club owners, claims hands-off style suits him. The owners letting job that I think be, explains. I sure aware predicament there stage affect anything.

Paul Clement urged Swansea City players crank pressure Hull City ensuring two-point gap relegation-threatened teams does widen final matches season. Swansea manager aware team points adrift time kick-off home Everton Saturday night, Marco Silva hosting Sunderland earlier day, convinced players turned corner recent weeks confident escape threat relegation win successive home games time 12 months. We got business [against Everton], Clement said. Got good result. Got pressure on. The fact they got Crystal Palace Tottenham; we got Sunderland West Brom  we got job Everton, we got focus that. With Premier League safety Hull lose, Clement talked need Swansea to use [situation] advantage. Clement main concern, though, players maintain standards set fixtures. We have spoken chasing; we just spoken need start performing better, way played West Ham Watford, continued playing like that, going outcome. Thankfully turned corner performed well, points Stoke home Manchester United away good return. And points, ca Everton points? Hull match Sunderland finish roughly 40 minutes Swansea kick-off Clement realistic know everyone going know result dressing room. Whether Hull win, lose draw, we got win. If win, we got gap same. If draw lose, we got advantage, stays us, said. Clement expected retain midfield diamond served Swansea well, means Jordan Ayew partner Fernando Llorente front. Ayew looking goal arriving Aston Villa January, Ghanaian impressed alongside Llorente, Clement reporting striker physical statistics chart Stoke saying the Man United. He come close [to goal], Clement added. He good opportunities Stoke. There hit inside [Jack] Butland heel day gone in. At Man United couple good chances. I sure come icing cake he doing lot things right. Arsne Wenger accustomed putting best pre-match media fandango. Given volatile climate arrives, straight bat ready, intent defuse dampen. It steady predictable weekend visit Manchester United line questions suddenly took unexpected bounce. What Wenger think Mesut zil renewing Tarmac driveway? Pause. Was trick question?

Tottenham Hotspur title charge skidded halt London Stadium Manuel Lanzini struck second-half goal celebrated lustily Chelsea fans West Ham faithful. Mauricio Pochettino men arrived nine-game winning streak mission slash Chelsea lead table single point performed sluggishly left regrets. Chelsea champions beat Middlesbrough Monday West Bromwich Albion Friday. For second season row Spurs tripped just gained momentum spawned hopes glory. They fly high, nearly reach sky, like dreams, fade ... well, West Ham fans know rest, Spurs, forever blowing opportunities. In fairness terrible display team undoubtedly progress season Pochettino fall standard set recent months whittling Chelsea lead 13 points four. There unfamiliar stodginess play defence wobbled uncharacteristically. That contrasted vigour West Ham battling guarantee survival flight, alleviate pressure Slaven Bilic heap misery London rivals. Job done. It stage season Spurs unravelled title race, draw home West Brom betraying loss nerve resulted Pochettino team failing win matches. Winning strengthen conviction evolved Spurs began tentatively quite rhythm, Adrin make handful decent saves prevent taking lead. The atmosphere kick-off electrifying arena tends suck energy football crowd. A crunching challenge Eric Dier Cheikh Kouyat minute added fuel fervour. But West Ham helter-skelter opening. Home fans leapt feet anticipation goal Andr Ayew clipped ball path Lanzini, run deep caught Kyle Walker off-guard. Mercifully England international Lanzini skewed feeble shot wide. Walker started despite reported disagreements manager fitness mooted transfer, trouble West Ham went cause came flank, Aaron Cresswell sort raids Walker usually inflicts others. That thing manager discuss defender. In 12th minute Cresswell sent dangerous cross post Byram headed wide. Moments later Walker caught booked clipping Lanzini. Spurs' best moment came midway period, Adrin rigmarole saving long-range shot Harry Kane. Jos Fonte block Dele Alli follow-up, Kane tried 15 yards Adrin redeemed himself sticking foot divert ball bar. Dier went close header ensuing corner Adrin blocked that, too. Hugo Lloris unflustered 27th minute charged box thwart Lanzini. He manner goalkeepers away with, hurling himself knees-first ball following opponent. West Ham fiery protests cut ice Anthony Taylor. Christian Eriksen tried home worry low shot 25 yards fizzed just wide. But Spurs' effort goal earlier salvo. So half-time hosts satisfied visitors. And smiles probably forming faces Chelsea players tuning in. Spurs 45 minutes avert deceleration title race tank. Ayew let blasted bar edge area. The Ghanaian denied chance atone Jonathan Calleri overhit easy through-ball. Walker flashed attacking quality splitting West Ham well-drilled defence sharp through-ball. But Eriksen fluffed resultant chance, gentle sidefooter yards likely beat Adrin. Son fired better effort minutes later goalkeeper saved again. Then West Ham finally summoned cutting edge punish Spurs. Unsurprisingly danger came left wing, Cresswell delivering cross post. Ayew decisive touch Spurs defence panicked ball rolled Lanzini, free yards goal. He lashed net ran savour acclaim crowd. The fact crash barrier collapsed amid celebrations, injuring fan, went unnoticed spectators demonstrated questions remain stadium suitability events. Spurs looked like equalising.

His recent brace Southampton ended seven-game scoreless streak competitions. Asked expected forward remain club season, Conte referred comment Eden Hazard previous week implied will player taken account comes decisions future. I repeat concept Diego single player, said.

Manchester City banned signing certain academy players years, Premier League announced. The club fined 300,000 breaching youth development rules relating signing players.

Their punishment comes Liverpool hit ban signing academy players years similar breach. Even officials long ago opted end Premiership campaign grand sudden-death Twickenham finale winced saw team-sheets weekend regular season. What climactic Saturday afternoon danger proving little Saracens Gloucester deciding pick strongest XVs effort key players fresh European finals week. If entirely understandable circumstances Saracens' Mark McCall fellow Ulsterman David Humphreys omitted main men, scarcely enhances competition standing precisely moment club rugby seeking broaden appeal. The 30,000 supporters bought tickets Wasps' supposed must-win home game fellow title-chasers Saracens watching visiting deliberately shorn key internationals. The conspicuous absence Vunipola brothers, Owen Farrell, Maro Itoje, Chris Ashton captain Brad Barritt draw complaints Wasps, keen secure home play-off semi-final table. McCall equally unfazed, arguing Sarries competitive unbothered, Champions Cup final Clermont Auvergne done, play domestic semi-final. With Gloucester resting Lions back-row Ross Moriarty naming experienced New Zealanders Jeremy Thrush Josh Hohneck bench Challenge Cup final Stade Franais, Exeter chances finishing boosted. Partly dilemma Premiership Rugby making; determination ensure domestic final ends season fortnight European showpiece places clubs impossible position competing fronts. As year dual European Premiership winners, Saracens, proved McCall argues flogging star assets week counter-productive: It hard players going. We got sensible make sure we strength games really matter. The stats, extent, up. The title claimed team finishing Premiership past years; seasons ago Sarries trailed fourth league lifted trophy. On hand, teams playing away semi-finals secured wins 26 attempts introduction play-offs, success rate 19%. If Saracens finish third, buck prevailing trend. The desire Wasps Exeter finish season bang overlooked. Wasps faltered under-performing European quarter-final Leinster Dublin par outing Harlequins. In response recalled fly-half Danny Cipriani, changes backline, England forward James Haskell insists collective motivation remains strong. It important make hard work season pay off, said. Everyone wants win silverware. This squad wo year boys leaving moving on. It important seize opportunity. You season fall final hurdle remembers you. It Wasps, course, perfected art peaking May decade ago Saracens just prefer return trip Ricoh Arena going Sandy Park face Exeter lost league October. In 21 games far Saracens conceded 23 tries, compared total 59 scored Wasps period. If latter much-vaunted attackers (84 tries) want secure bonus-point win guarantee spot, going stand counted forward. Exeter Kingsholm knowing end heading final table time manage bonus-point victory Wasps fail likewise. The home semi-final important variety reasons, said Rob Baxter, squad set record seven successive maximum five-point wins. The important reason want bring big game Sandy Park play supporters. That said, is be-all end-all. We good away home well. The slight concern Baxter, registered league points before, Greg Holmes, Dave Ewers, Don Armand Lachie Turner picked knocks Northampton week unavailable face Gloucester. England Jack Nowell switches wing full-back, Dave Dennis reverting row alongside Julian Salvi. Gloucester theoretically qualify Champions Cup season play-offs 20th place tournament involve sides Pro12 French Top 14. If, alternatively, fail beat Exeter Northampton pip Harlequins final automatic European qualifying spot, hopes featuring premier tournament end lose Stade Franais Edinburgh Friday. As management team we conscious cup final opportunities come that, said Humphreys. But huge game want respond disappointing performance Bath weekend. As things stand, Leicester best placed grasp fourth final play-off spot final-day opponents, Worcester, run decent form tutelage director rugby, Gary Gold. A convincing defeat Tigers leave door ajar Bath, travel Sale injured Anthony Watson Lion, Jonathan Joseph, omitted matchday squad second week row listed injured. Not sweetness light Rec, despite Sunday thumping win Gloucester, semi-final line-up Exeter v Leicester Wasps v Saracens feels likelier outcome. Among oddities Arsne Wenger long goodbye Arsenal  anger, corporate vacuum, sense dying sun-king exploring outer edges vanity  interesting details weird, gimmicky switch past matches. It unsettling stage, kind ageing-swinger version tactical innovation. At point classic Rabbit novels, John Updike sends paunchy, middle-aged anti-hero Harry Angstrom slightly sad wife-swapping escapade golfing holiday Caribbean. Alone bamboo chalet, Harry nice prim Thelma fumble belated moment 1960s swing awkward married tenderness. Eventually, little desperate, search special exciting do, end urinating bath. This pretty Arsenal like: confused, fumbling, spreading chest like hot, sweet flush ammoniac regret. Wenger kept place Tottenham Sunday. Faced entire team grooved drilled play way, exposed is, suit borrowed clothes, act man looking, slightly desperately, do. This surprising turn Wenger endgame. Personally, I'd expecting more, Arsne-like time, obsessed old vision fluent, soft-shoed Wenger-ball. Instead this: odd positional shifts, lumpen midfield Wenger-like team decades. Of course, reasonable standards Wenger gone, verge announcing departure. This punitive judgment. Wenger does deserve jeered outstanding record belittled. But things end date, good ones. Instead signs stay on. And current dog days, manager little recognisable passing week. Perhaps genuine disdain, gleeful piling past days comes from. Even Wenger told Norwegian TV week hates himself Arsenal lose. And watching writhe touchline White Hart Lane, cold terribly thin, skinny legged trousers, icicles dripping nose, air sadness. Often gripping thing watching managers fail way certain traits pulled exaggerated defining effect. When Pep Guardiola hits sticky patch ever-more extreme Guardiola, great whirring brain producing teams fluent frictionless barely touch turf. Jos Mourinho fails going Mourinho-supernova, drowning bile, cartoon Jos-ness undeniably himself. By contrast thing current, prosaic Arsenal team lack bit basic Wenger-ness. Until quite recently people agree great flaw Arsenal craft midfield, excess slick passing flashy movement. Buy tough, strong central player, said. Change formation, said. So did, like man comfort zone, lost new world, shuffling anxiously avocado bathroom suite, quilted gown trailing tiles. At end latest Wenger team midfield bereft craft life. Granit Xhaka, Francis Coquelin, Mohamed Elneny Aaron Ramsey league goal combined 84 appearances. Arsenal routinely out-passed out-moved traditional area strength. Wenger, deemed maddening man football refusal compromise principles, appears making hoof. Even switch hot new 4-23-1 felt little late, season tactical skinny jeans. In retrospect looks like good old days, age lightweight, Velcro-touch skill-goblins, extreme one-note coherent style follow powerful, technical team early years. Something lost time man introduced internationalism decided right thing British spine. Exit creaky, flighty, high class midweek Carling Cup types  Carlos Vela Supremacy  frustrations brilliant midweek hat-trick Reading locker. Enter creeping, well-behaved mediocrity. In fairness Wenger massing Santi Cazorla, Arsenal best player gorgeously poised central conductor team look fluent capable. But lack replacement tells story. The classically Wenger-ish players sign Manchester City days. Old, puritanical Arsne bought Ilkay Gundogan, Gabriel Jesus, Nolito Leroy San - brilliant attack midfield moving large profit.What here? The idea team final farewell title floated recently start season. The obvious decay squad, loss edge, extreme qualities, makes look horribly far-fetched. But time gearing up. If Wenger really does insist taking final turn, surely himself, group players plan looks plays like Wenger team. Stay strong, Arsne. Draw height. Field tiniest, skilful woodland elves. Stand bolted touchline, grey quilted coat quietly mouldering away, white duke pared defiantly basic parts. Give final whiff Wengerball. And do, do, bath Thelma. Not now, time.

That best days life I saw meant people  people worked hard club back, Flynn says. But I think Notts County game arguably bigger.

At meeting Short Martin Bain, Sunderland chief executive, aftermath Saturday defeat Bournemouth confirmed club relegation Premier League, men adamant want remain charge. Such positive mood music saw Everton, Manchester United Real Sociedad manager say yes television interviewer response question Wearside season finalised Moyes meets Short month. Perhaps tellingly, Scot little cryptic subsequently quizzed future apparent change heart seven days earlier. He merely reiterated  repeatedly  four-year contract. Ellis board want stay, conversations Ellis good, said. We meeting end season. We initial plans down. I know needs Premier League, I know requirements, we initial talks. I want able team come straight up. That aim, Premier League. And look that. That definitely key talks. I know come end season, exactly we able deal with, work with, we know exactly do. We look. The 54-year-old said confident the 100% backing Short Bain. The talks good, said. But have nailed initial conversation. Those comments welcomed majority Sunderland fans, demanded Moyes sacking recent games remains defiant privately insistent forced supporter dissent. When I sat right start season felt like Sunderland supporter wanted David Moyes manager, said. And I think single Sunderland supporter knew rebuild needed. Those fans hoped Moyes accomplish suffering relegation club sixth manager seven years believes scapegoat series bad decisions predating appointment. Matters complicated Short enthusiasm selling Sunderland, Moyes suggested horizon. There bit background, said. But I ca present. With loanees returning parent clubs summer 10 senior professionals contract, upheaval imminent Moyes, spent 30m summer, week begin telling players offer new deals. John O'Shea expected stay depart.

It was supposed end way. This year supposed different. The Capitals won Presidents' Trophy best regular season record NHL primed postseason, make second round playoffs time Alexander Ovechkin 12-year career finally win Stanley Cup organization waiting entering league 1974. Instead, Capitals 60 minutes hockey away having Pittsburgh Penguins fans celebrate street Verizon Center steps National Portrait Gallery again. PARTY ON THE STEPS!  pic.twitter.com/NAKeaV7Tq4 Of course, paragraph similar doubt written publication 2010 2016 Caps won Presidents' Trophy. They going win Cup then, too, year between. Washington good team long time, making playoffs 10 years, winning division seven years. But postseason starts quickly collapses Washington ceiling regular season banners. The Capitals-in-the-playoffs running joke generation hockey fans. But good news Capitals fans that end. Either Ovechkin friends manage win games row Penguins  team supposed rival 8-1 record playoff series all-time  playoffs or, likely scenario: Capitals eliminated coming days management decides finally, mercifully, blow thing start over. The hard committing rebuild Capitals are, been, legitimately close. Even playoffs. A year ago 2nd Round lost competitive six-game series Penguins, eventual Cup champion. They lost Penguins epic seven-game series way Pittsburgh winning 2009. After year defeat, Capitals general manager Brian MacLellan said Penguins: No, I do think clearly better. I think looked shot statistics pretty equal. Maybe advantage scoring chances. I think goaltending pretty equal. It close series. I think hindsight, I think missed opportunities. That positive spin series lose lower-seeded team games, was entirely delusional. It competitive series. So MacLellan headed season exactly roster intact, Ovechkin goaltender Braden Holtby questionable pieces like Brooks Orpik Daniel Winnik, confident Washington size physicality finally win out. Fast-forward year series Penguins shot statistics equal all. The Capitals outshot Penguins 142-93 games puck possession approximately all-of-the-minutes Washington none-of-the-minutes Pittsburgh. The Penguins ca break puck zone injured defenseman Kris Letang problem gotten worse Sidney Crosby taken early Game 3. Shots, scoring chances, puck possession, want measure it, Capitals outplaying Penguins possible way scoreboard pipes. If performance Pittsburgh goalie Marc-Andre Fleury, Washington probably won series sweep. Instead, they brink having blow up. Assuming series ends like everyone, including Caps fans, think will, Washington ca just throw group ice year hope outcome change. That definition insanity, no? That banging head wall we learned Washington likes reserve blows head Sidney Crosby alone. MacLellan cite shot statistics talk pretty equal wants, reality team failed. Again. Again again, fact, we counting. And time Penguins Letang, Crosby supposed No1 goalie Matt Murray. The reason trying group Capitals solidify place consistently disappointing sports team all-time, they already. The Buffalo Bills Super Bowl times inevitably losing; Capitals ca conference finals once. Kevin Shattenkirk, TJ Oshie Justin Williams veteran Caps unrestricted free agents offseason jettisoning quick way kick rebuild. Somehow ridding plodding Orpik, prominently featured background Penguins goal, help, too. Maybe Capitals discuss dealing Holtby think good return trade. But Ovechkin featured legitimate worthwhile rebuild. He non-factor series, scoring single goal Washington Game 1 loss, spending rest series fringes action like random fourth-liner. But he big-name player netted 33 goals season. There trading partners Washington wants them. Dealing face franchise big decision. But does say face franchise franchise synonymous disappointment failure? It time new Washington. Even new making playoffs years. Caps fans probably agree it better same, old losing.

At White Hart Lane Thursday evening, Premier League 2 visit Leicester City under-23s, took step forward rehabilitation. It time played tragedy, away game Manchester United Monday having postponed marks respect Ehiogu. It felt cathartic young players there, doing best, occasion man here.

Koeman insists spoke Catalonian newspaper impending managerial vacancy Barcelona upcoming 25th anniversary club European Cup success, goal Sampdoria Wembley delivered. Speaking Everton Finch Farm training ground Thursday, said: I mentioned times human ambition  players managers  does change position contract Everton. I really happy Everton looking forward season I project. The interview coming 25 years won European Cup Wembley. There chance I leave Everton end contract. When I got offer Everton season. Already season showed close close enough. It real compliment players achieved season. For season like more. We need learn season. I hope play Europe [throughout] season. It makes tough want develop team. Koeman refused Aaron Lennon condition, Everton winger receiving treatment stress-related illness, insisted pressure players increased various reasons playing days. As know club mentioned Aaron stress-related illness private situation, Everton manager said. We try support help come soon possible. We contact family I think best inside club, player family. We like important like was. Life, health, important football. Asked added pressure today players, responded: On yes social media different 20 years ago course pressure. There football, games, international football  really tough players. The Everton manager confirmed Arouna Kon offered contract extension deal expires end season. In middle biggest wins season, San Antonio Spurs suffered painful loss. In fourth quarter shaping blowout victory Houston Rockets, Spurs point guard Tony Parker crumbled ground, clutching left leg eventually carried floor. San Antonio ended winning Game 2 121-96, evening series Houston, post-game mood celebratory. When asked Tony Parker injury, Spurs head coach Gregg Popovich response characteristically blunt: It good. While Spurs know extent Parker injury talked expecting remainder series. It hard limping hurting kind know we going time soon, said longtime team-mate Manu Ginobili game. On Thursday, confirmed Parker ruptured left quadriceps tendon miss rest playoffs. While Parker longer central Spurs' plans peak  stretch long ago undisputed team MVP  steadying presence. During round series Memphis Grizzlies, Parker vintage performance, averaging 16.3 points, 3.0 assists 2.2 rebounds shooting 53.3% floor. His injury means San Antonio way replace Parker offense 25 minutes game he averaged course season. Popovich certainly promote capable Patty Mills start absence playing time Ginobili  considering turns 40 July. It likely Kawhi Leonard, scored 34 points went 13-for-16 Wednesday game team offensive burden. The Spurs depth losing starting point guard is debilitating teams, back-up plan back-up plan reason. The timing particularly ideal Spurs, middle competitive series distance. The Rockets shocked league blowing Spurs 126-99 Game 1 AT&T Center, place San Antonio normally nearly invulnerable. Even Game 2 blowout, Rockets actually managed play Spurs close quarters despite Leonard company holding James Harden 3-for-17 shooting floor. It was early fourth quarter run game devolved lopsided laugher. It strange say series started back-to-back blowouts, Rockets/Spurs evenly matched series conference semi-finals, absolutely swayed loss veteran starting point guard (just ask Chicago Bulls go). The encouraging thing San Antonio Wednesday, avoiding falling 0-2 hole, lead Rockets actually expanded Parker left game. It exact opposite Spurs' uncharacteristic total meltdown second half Game 1 positive reminder overwhelm opponents help longest tenured players. But Parker gone rest playoffs, look worst case scenario: just seen end Hall Fame career. With Tim Duncan retired Ginobili likely bow offseason (although feels like we said year) there plenty conversation Parker, skills begun decline, join team-mates. For part, Parker rejected idea, saying retired international play order extend NBA career I want end Spurs career high note, said December, I want play years. As optimistic Parker sounded time, age injuries way disrupting determined athlete long term plans. If injury ends affect career, there chance final image Parker clutching leg agony rest team court, forced play him. Let hope not, deserves better end this.

To majority football supporters, Italian game fallen giant. Serie A seen fading image best league planet  image remains vivid memories older generations. Its keenest aficionados disagree but, given people experience Italian clubs European competitions, really blamed holding gloomy view Serie A? This year followed familiar trend, Juventus team Europe start April. Napoli beaten Real Madrid home away last-16 Champions League, Roma make group stage defeat Porto qualifiers. Instead, dropped Europa League, lost Lyon last-16. But went Fiorentina, knocked knockout stage, Inter Sassuolo, finished groups. Inter, champions Europe just seven years ago, finished Sparta Prague, Hapoel Be'er Sheva Southampton. Italian clubs proved disappointing Europe country stadiums academies outdated, reasons optimism. A number clubs competing places Europe shown signs step challenge title. Juve continue raise bar season but, chasing pack continue improve, significant evidence Italian clubs way elite. There considerable quality, verve excitement league  glimmer end tunnel. Despite Juve seemingly comfortable glide sixth successive Scudetto, season revealed tough battle positions league, fans likely edge seats minute game. At table, Juventus sit points Roma 10 Napoli, clubs possess technical excellence required challenge leaders. They just lack intangible quality: winning mentality. Juventus played entertaining football season Napoli Roma (who outscored league) unable exploit occasional slip-ups. For instance, Juventus draw Atalanta Friday night Roma responded losing derby 3-1 Lazio Sunday afternoon. Napoli shown glimpses sheer brilliance Maurizio Sarri season Italian club gone Europe pride, winning Champions League group putting hearty display Real Madrid last-16. With aesthetically pleasing styles Europe place season Champions League qualifiers guaranteed, look ready step league Europe. Lazio, sit seven points Napoli games place, building fine squad Simone Inzaghi potential compete elite season.

Indeed, Atalanta lack necessary prestige hold promising starlets  midfielder Roberto Gagliardini having joined Inter defender Mattia Caldara bound Juventus years  Gian Piero Gasperini men breath fresh air positive ambassadors Italian football. The youngest team fielded Serie A season belongs Milan, regularly XI average age just 24. Vincenzo Montella solid core young talents  including 22-year-old Alessio Romagnoli, 19-year-old Manuel Locatelli, 23-year-old Suso 18-year-old goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma  earned good experience beating Juventus win Supercoppa Italiana time years December. The club experienced CEO Marco Fassone new Chinese owners say want retain young talents adding quality squad. It time effort, it project excites owners, according Fassone.

After numerous managerial tribulations  Roberto Mancini leaving shortly season began Frank Boer sacked midway campaign  dubious investments transfer market (namely Brazilian forward Gabriel Barbosa French midfielder Geoffrey Kondogbia), Inter main aim restructure squad summer. If new owners prove competent ambitious, Milan clubs feet soon. The Milanese giants long way want catch Juventus. The Old Lady domestic champions left Europe season course win treble month.

It requires cursory glance Six Nations viewing figures understand Premiership Rugby deal Channel 5 broadcast matches season terrestrial TV makes obvious sense. A combined 11 million tuned popular matches BBC ITV clearly fanciful suggest similar numbers club competitions, sizeable potential audience. A certain type casual rugby fan need little push. The post-Six Nations drop-off annual problem rugby union factors play  BBC Wales promotional anti-English video year competition poor taste renewing national rivalries yearly basis evidently tournament appeal  live English club rugby screened free-to-air TV time season significant step. The fact Channel 5 simulcast matches  time BT Sport stands gain four-year deal worth 1m  relevant. Its successful bid, described auction beauty contest, largely centred showcasing cricket coverage, includes highlights England home matches and, conjunction BT Sport, simulcasting Australia Big Bash League. It relevant clear overlap sports' demographic audiences removal cricket crown jewels  list sporting events ring-fenced terrestrial TV  allowed rugby union prosper, grab cricket land mainstream media coverage. BT Sport investment commitment undoubtedly helped  chummy punditry began broadcasting Premiership rugby 2013, TV audiences risen 40% existing deal runs 2021 80 matches season. A free-to-air platform, however, altogether different proposition. The ITV4 highlights pulls 500,000 viewers good day  BT Sport draws  insiders forecast Channel 5 board total figures reach high 1.5 million given weekend. As Exeter chairman, Tony Rowe, said: The reality it exposure. The deal we BT Sport good, it going year year ca beat terrestrial TV. Instead talking 100,000s, you talking millions. Last year Premiership Rugby announced deal NBC broadcast rights United States year onwards matches shown live China weekly basis time. Throw ham-fisted proposal 10-month season begins look like expansionism, reasons obvious  Premiership clubs make profit, Rowe hopes latest deal way addressing that. To attract sponsors, need viewing figures it great stepping stone, hesaid. Premiership rugby infancy trying compete European clubs, salaries lot money game. I sure long way improving number sponsors interested. A number details Channel 5 deal ironed  coverage expected announced early summer  feeding scraps. Games matter matches described BT Sport ultimately chooses schedule, Channel 5 pick premium matches, likely Six Nations Championship, international players end-of-season shake-up coming view. Indeed, climax domestic season perennially problem. The Champions Cup semi-finals took place weekend FA Cup Premiership Rugby recorded largest weekend attendances early April, broadcast figures doubt dipped half hour Grand National. It time year spotlight harder earn terrestrial coverage silver bullet, help. It remains seen Channel 5 broadcast Friday matches, Saturday, Sunday mixture tend marginal drop-off viewing figures, relevant quality fixture. That turn raises question favouritism glamorous clubs. Wasps, example, all-singing, all-dancing attacking style, greater pull clubs stellar cast-list players limit certain club featured, 12 day sun season. The hope, however, years, touch optimistically, willingness work greater good. Incidentally, time Channel 5 bid domestic rugby union. In 2003 hoped highlights BBC Heineken Cup coverage, gazumped Sky Sports 11th hour October year. Just weeks later England lifted World Cup suddenly live English club rugby terrestrial TV. That taken 14 years return demonstrates challenges facing club game clearly right direction. Conor Murray given British & Irish Lions lift confirming return shoulder-related nerve injury imminent. Warren Gatland, Lions head coach, said Murray prove fitness Munster squad depart New Zealand 29 May participate tour first-choice scrum-half early weekend. If Saturday clash Connacht proves early, Ireland international make appearance penultimate round Six Nations Guinness Pro12 semi-final fortnight time. I good, finally. I training lads couple weeks trained Monday, Tuesday Wednesday week, Murray said. I doing gradual return-to-play contact, hopefully I playing soon. On evening Thursday 14 May 1987, matches kicked country determine clubs snap available places division English football. A combined attendance 77,452 witnessed series play-off matches Football League, 4,164 gathered Recreation Ground Aldershot 29,472 assembled Elland Road. There great fanfare, media pretty shunning games. It feasible blink miss arrival play-offs. Television coverage non-existent, apart odd local news clip tucked away sports bulletin. The written press paid scant attention arrival new-fangled competition, newspapers reports perfunctory best. The Times summed Division Four semi-final leg single sentence: Gary Johnson raised Aldershot hopes Third Division football season goal 13 minutes end. A Minor Counties versus Glamorgan cricket match given coverage semi-finals. Oh, Times times changed. When two-legged finals kicked end May marginal increase media interest, stretched paragraphs national press sentences. There live broadcasts days expected play-offs years. They introduced purely mechanism phase reduction old First Division 22 clubs 20. As Football League restructured so-called Heathrow Agreement man responsible introduction, Martin Lange, chairman Brentford time, admitted consideration consequences chairmen voted them. We threw play-offs end guys interested money side, said Lange. They concerned play-offs. I could lasting 20 years, 10 years, probably years. Lange pessimism proved unfounded 30 years later play-offs thriving, having firmly established pinnacle 72 Football League clubs' season finals providing EFL showpiece occasions, jewels crown. Over weeks, Sky Sports 15 play-off games live excess 50 hours airtime dedicated competition. When Exeter City qualified League Two play-offs weekend, 97th club so. By time Championship play-offs final decided 29 May, total 477 play-off matches tentative start 1987. The format changed 30 years. The biggest difference that, years relegation slot, club higher division battling clubs division below. Of clubs involved higher divisions years, ended relegated, including Chelsea, dropped First Division losing 2-1 aggregate Middlesbrough. So Charlton Athletic lay claim club avoid relegation play-offs, having eventually overcome Leeds extra-time replay St Andrews 1987. After John Sheridan given Leeds lead 99th minute, centre-back Peter Shirtliff unlikeliest goalscoring heroes brace space minutes. Considering Barnsley-born Shirtliff managed total 15 goals 18-year career, purple patch fellow Yorkshiremen without. The inaugural Second Division play-off final went replay Swindon Town drew 2-2 Gillingham aggregate. Swindon won replay 2-0 Selhurst Park Lou Macari, victorious manager, clearly early adopter getting carried away wave euphoria. I want night like again, said Macari. The play-offs unfair scrapped. Fortunately, majority relish end-of-season shenanigans, Macari damning words fell deaf ears. The play-offs divided opinion, arguing unfair little cruel clubs finish streets ahead rivals denied promotion regular league season. That argument given credence 2016, top-placed teams play-offs  Brighton, Walsall Accrington Stanley  qualified finals beaten teams collectively 35 points them. Joe Royle Oldham manager faced Leeds 1987 semi-final joined Macari railing injustice all: We finished seven points clear Leeds. So away goals means unjust. I welcomed play-offs possibly had considered long-term ramifications. Despite Royle warnings long-term ramifications, play-offs gone popular, enduring feature football calendar. Their ability create drama tension perfectly illustrated Royle managerial tilt play-offs dozen years on, charge Manchester City. May 1999 proved quite month Manchester clubs. United completed treble stunning last-gasp victory Bayern Munich Camp Nou and, days later, City met Gillingham Wembley attempted escape tier, dropped time history previous season. The Second Division play-offs final glamour Champions League final match arguably just significant City. Nearly 77,000 people watched agog as, eerie parallel events Barcelona, match won improbably late goals added spice friendly rivalry. When Gillingham goalkeeper Vince Bartram agreed Paul Dickov best man probably envisage groom months later. After scoring late goals  81st 86th minutes  seemingly unassailable 2-0 lead, Tony Pulis' team taste second-tier football time history. Kevin Horlock 89th-minute goal whiff consolation stem flow City fans leaving stadium disconsolate trek north contemplated having face taunts United fans. But nobody, including close friend Bartram, factored Dickov capacity engineer miraculous rescue 95th-minute equaliser senses laid foundations City rise Premier League title just decade later. City won match penalties, Gillingham scoring kicks. Despite pivotal moment City, central character convinced play-offs. Undoubtedly scarred experiences Oldham 1987, Royle forthright criticism: They deserved this, said City fans, But I hate play-offs. They lottery joke. We played 46 games finished extra cup finals. Royle objection ignores stimulating effect raft teams immersed mid-table torpor hope making play-offs. Without them, season memorable stories materialised. The continuing rise AFC Wimbledon 2002 rebirth sixth promotion 13 seasons courtesy League Two play-offs final victory Plymouth Argyle inspiration clubs lower leagues. The man primarily responsible 21st-century fairytale loyal devotee club 301 appearances original Wimbledon FC 1991 2002 took manager 2012. Neal Ardley understandably euphoric match reflected journey club. It dream of, said. To stand 20,000 people 14 years ago club ripped away them, stand came ranks age 11, does better that. You write story want. Hollywood scriptwriters suitably alerted. Matching Ardley achievement 2016 remarkable renaissance Barnsley, League One early December triumphed Millwall Wembley months later unlikeliest promotions. Barnsley recovery impressive considering that, just gaining momentum February having reached half table, manager Lee Johnson suddenly left join Bristol City. Stepping breach Barnsley-born Paul Heckingbottom, taking caretaker manager second time space year. Like Ardley, 39-year-old Heckingbottom played club managing, making success sweeter. The manager future secure right end season. The message start speaking game, Heckingbottom said. Now sort everyone future out. Everyone knows I want stay. If I had bench I'd watching. The captivating stories Barnsley AFC Wimbledon year reinforce uplifting spirit characterises play-offs 30 years positive impact English football. Surely Royle Macari want turn clock 30 years days automatic promotion deny delights Leyton Orient chairman Barry Hearn described the best invention ever team just lost 2001 Third Division final. Richard updated book play-offs, The Agony Ecstasy, week As soon Huddersfield Town 10 changes match Birmingham City Saturday clear going trouble. There resting rotation 10 changes unnecessary provocative, bound invite investigation. Ten number changes Mick McCarthy infamously 2009 Wolves faced tricky midweek match Old Trafford winnable home game Burnley. Despite argument much-altered team contained number internationals experienced players McCarthy disguise fact essentially written Manchester United game inevitable defeat  Wolves lost 3-0  club fined suspended 25,000 prevent similar stunts later season. They beat Burnley following weekend, however, McCarthy got wanted, 70,000 crowd inside Old Trafford short-changed expecting sort entertainment. So David Wagner quite sensibly felt important spare best players play-offs Huddersfield went Birmingham, got away half dozen 10 going attract attention. Birmingham managed win 2-0, despite having man sent half, Harry Redknapp ended important points secured, Nottingham Forest Blackburn Rovers quite naturally complained Town team selection handed relegation rivals unfair advantage. The Football League written Huddersfield asking explanation, making clear punishment nature fine replay restatement result. Birmingham points, words, Redknapp final day weekend, Forest Blackburn sit points closer trapdoor. It unsatisfactory situation, certainly, sympathy possible Dean Whitehead tweet, veteran midfielder observed 45 games Huddersfield earned right team liked play-off place attained, Forest Blackburn blame mire match go. Tough fair. The Championship notoriously long hard grind, going play-offs easy task demanding season. Wagner naturally wants himself best chance, decides important fresh, rested players finish place higher final table, say wrong? Were promotion simply matter finishing high table possible, used be, excuse picking one matches end, play-off routine mini-competition right, crisis built constitution, EFL going ask promotion hopefuls jump final hoop really object clubs making necessary preparations. Furthermore, Wagner rotating fairly heavily season. Not extent 10 changes, granted, quite regularly swapping half dozen. Most players involved Birmingham started game Manchester City FA Cup, little outcry fielding weakened team, Town managed Premier League opponents replay. All starting lineup Birmingham bar 10 appearances season, weakened team anyway? In old days team stiffs, knew which, highest levels football squad game nowadays. Look Chelsea leaving Eden Hazard Diego Conte hour FA Cup semi-final Spurs. Beforehand talk Antonio Conte disrespecting game competition. Afterwards agreement best occasions Wembley witnessed. That Chelsea squad strong overall quality high significant withdrawals. The does apply way league  certainly apply Wolves years ago  Championship terms Huddersfield playing squad Wagner. They shown ability make changes discernible drop quality. All doubt pointing Football League answer charges them. They probably able mount stronger logical case authority, rules state simply requirement play full-strength sides league matches, unless satisfactory reason given. Woolly, what? Does involvement forthcoming play-off contests count satisfactory reason, not? Check Championship fixtures weekend, weekend before, Premier League equivalents matter. Was playing strongest team? Over course season players routinely rested, dropped, protected injury simply left different formation tried. This normal. No hears complaints it. The notion full-strength normally cup finals knockout rounds, major derbies grudge matches immediate rivals. A game fifth place relegation trouble penultimate weekend season does really come category. No blamed Huddersfield taking easy, selection Wagner came with. Whitehead right: Huddersfield worked hard season enjoy little respite wish  teams on beach?  matter probably gone unnoticed breaking 10th commandment. Which is, simply, do change team. It looks bad. When invite trainer offer excuse horse, generally alacrity. So interesting Charlie Appleby turned opportunity Ascot yesterday Blue Point got winner enclosure time Gimcrack. I asked if, benefit months reflect it, offer insights Blue Point place Dewhurst. He just met good, response. The Dewhurst won Churchill, pacemaker hanging second place. Appleby predicted, correctly, Churchill odds Saturday 2,000 Guineas shorten wake Blue Point reappearance win. Churchill has run Dewhurst runners shown form strong. Lancaster Bomber, runner-up, second Breeders' Cup. Thunder Snow, fourth, won starts since, including UAE Derby, crack Kentucky Derby Saturday night. Rivet, fifth, won Racing Post Trophy time. Other Guineas contenders pressed case recently Churchill. But piece autumn form looks gold standard stage.

Hull 17th table, points Swansea, fixtures remaining clubs. Swansea goal difference -29 compared Hull -31, Welsh club scored goals. Should records identical come end season, relegation place stake, Premier League unprecedented step organising one-off match line rules laid annual handbook decide club retain top-flight status. Premier League rules state: If end season league champions clubs relegated question qualification competitions determined clubs equal points, goal difference goals scored, clubs concerned shall play deciding league matches neutral grounds, format, timing venue shall determined board. Paul Clement, Swansea manager, admitted aware possibility play-off game said hopes avoid. Asked scenario now, given Swansea trailing Hull, replied: No. Although it points, it tighter we got [left play], they got, different ramifications, especially involve Crystal Palace, involve Tottenham Chelsea situation. I think it table shows, certainly mental point view. Provision playoff game occasions past, albeit relation relegation, financial ramifications greater. In 1996 tickets printed play-off Manchester United Newcastle United held Wembley title decider finished level. Manchester United ended winning league points. Discussions held Arsenal Chelsea eve final round fixtures 2012-13 season, possibility clubs finishing season tied place  automatic Champions League qualification prize  unable separated points, goal difference goals scored. On occasion Chelsea finished points ahead Arsenal. It understood Premier League taken step consulting Swansea Hull prospect play-off match, possibility 39th game considered senior club staff little while. Clement, meanwhile, expressed surprise Mike Riley, head Professional Game Match Officials Limited, attempt touch wake Neil Swarbrick blunder Manchester United Sunday, referee awarded penalty Swansea given Marcus Rashford dived. I chose FA occasion, Swansea manager said. I felt I point clearly media afterwards. But I communication anyone. The delegates' report get, I heard Mike Riley situation. It surprised nature position in. I thought communication. Swansea wrong end poor refereeing decisions months. Swarbrick denied Swansea looked clear penalty Chelsea, Anthony Taylor erroneously awarded Burnley spot-kick March Clement maintains Mike Dean unfairly penalised Swansea prior Manchester City scoring late winner February. We fair share they potentially cost us, Clement said. If given penalty Chelsea score 2-1, lose better team. But different Man United I sure got point Man City dealt correctly. I ca blame Neil Swarbrick decision [on Sunday], giving doubt, I feel was. Barcelona beckons Formula One prepares begin European season proper, teams having 10 days reflect opening races prepare upgrades unveiled Spain. The new regulations thrown tense gripping, spectacular, prologue racing better feared, absolutely cracking battle prospect. Time then, consider leading drivers teams stand returning fray Circuit Catalunya. Ferrari resurgence proved perfect fillip F1 Sebastian Vettel. The German fine fettle just championship lead. Vettel relaxed happier joining team 2015. Last season frustration fractious relationship Ferrari gone driving reflects this. He huge confidence car team making right calls pit wall. Two wins foot going Europe. His main rival remains Lewis Hamilton, similarly strong opening concerns hope addressed. The three-time world champion trails Vettel 13 points, win Shanghai. A poor race Russia, pace weekend, does reflect solid campaign. In Australia Ferrari better strategy similarly Bahrain, compounded Hamilton pit-lane-entry mistake. What needs ease ride Vettel. He struggled tyres right window working hard process. He buoyant, confident genuinely enjoying scrap, narrowing gap German paramount. Hamilton team-mate, Valtteri Bottas, F1 win Sochi, believes repeat feat himself title mix. Certainly, crammed huge season. A solid Australia followed unforced error China, spinning safety car. He redeemed pole Bahrain turn mechanical problem Mercedes ultimately led succumb team orders. The subsequent win pretty house, seasons races stand good stead, Finn needs secure win quickly realistic threat. The fourth main protagonist, Kimi Raikkonen, remains outlier. Having started slowly produced best performance Russia second grid race. He struggled end Ferrari car proving highly competitive threatening. Sochi gives grounds optimism moment looks likely role taking points Mercedes Hamilton. The relative strengths weaknesses rides clearer development battle begin earnest Spain, patterns emerging. Ferrari foot. The SF70H superb balance, strong corners, runs turbulent air wide operating window tyres. The factor greatest importance, Sam Collins, motor racing engineer deputy editor Racecar Engineering magazine, confirms. The real key built car works tyre range, says. A really versatile machine, big advantage wide operating window, thing done, it concept. Mercedes, contrast, car narrower operating window nearly comfortable dirty air. It designed run head field pace  undoubtedly fast  cost. They designed car run clean air, front, Collins says. But narrow operating window, gets window I believe quicker Ferrari easy drop Ferrari it. The final major player disappointed. Red Bull unexpectedly pace. The car lacked downforce new machine promised Spain, step require enormous clear indication coming from. The Red Bull chassis looked bit unfinished launched, says Collins. I do know missing I look I do really understand direction taken. In terms making radical change unlikely. There concept car ca just click fingers change that, says. You gearbox, monocoque on, parts ca just switch. Red Bull resources I do think going to. I think means new bodywork, work. We shall answers Barcelona, battle rejoined equally absorbing European season cards. For once, European club campaigns aligned. The regular league seasons England, France Pro12 finish weekend, Premiership Rugby way 2019-20 player able contemplate going holiday July. The leagues play-off system, champions determined perform weeks months. Under old system, Premiership three-way tussle weekend Wasps Exeter 79 points Saracens, Ricoh Arena Saturday, points third. In Pro12, leaders, Leinster, points ahead Munster assured home draw, France La Rochelle lead Clermont Auvergne, opponents Saturday, 10 points. Clermont, fighting fronts like Saracens having European Champions Cup final, paced need win ensure sit round play-offs. The drawn France, teams involved four. When Premiership adopted play-offs 2002-03, main reason given clubs shorn international players months season  one-third league campaign  fairer supplied large number players England Test sides first-past-the-post. Not champions revert leads table end final round matches 2019-20 club season expands 10 months, international weekends largely filled Anglo-Welsh-South Africa Cup matches. It allow clubs throttle virtually entire Premiership campaign, play-offs lucrative Twickenham sells final. When Premiership Rugby introduced system, rapturously received. Wasps won finals beat team finished time, appreciating consistency important peaking right time. Saracens finish Exeter win Gloucester Saturday, lost Gloucester Worcester, matches played Six Nations, strength? A team finished fourth Premiership won final, Saracens 2014-15, Northampton Leicester previously Twickenham. The Tigers currently lie fourth place, points ahead Bath, trip Worcester Saturday face opponents lost twice flight. They 17 points Wasps Exeter having mustered bonus points matches season, crowned champions. Unlikely, perhaps, play-off perennials. Stade Franais sixth Top 14 having won away match league, relegated Bayonne, maintain position madly congested table 10 points separate Castres fifth Toulouse, mighty fallers, 12th, chance win league. In Pro 12, Ospreys fourth 15 points Leinster leagues gap teams play-offs, mind rest. The question winners league decided knockout tournament, marathon runners having turn sprinters, long debated, decided pay philosophy. Which argument losing international players significant chunk season applied end table Premiership. Had Worcester finished bottom, cited loss centre Ben Te'o England autumn Six Nations, commercial play-off sides be? Should team finishes fourth potential reward league trophy? If Premiership Rugby succeeds bid 10-month season, international tours follow, clubs able pick strength all, virtually all, league season, merit play-off plunder backers spectators? Why not, instead, play-off teams Premiership Pro12, second respective champions enjoying home advantage semi-final?

This statistic Jos Mourinho team improve Europa League semi-final leg Celta Vigo Thursday night pole position return Old Trafford week. The poor run stretches 60 years 5-3 defeat Athletic Bilbao, wins arriving millennium. In April 2002 United defeated Deportivo La Corua, Vigo traditional rivals, Champions League quarterfinal courtesy goals David Beckham Ruud van Nistelrooy. In September 2010 Valencia defeated 1-0 Mestalla Javier Hernndez goal group meeting. Given record, cagey European semi-finals are, draw, particularly scoring one, disastrous result. But Mourinho ideas. We struggled Premier League, it complicated, win, said. It us. When somebody arrives semi-final want final. The Europa League long competition. To final team play group stages, knockout phases, travel lot arrive semifinal want final. Celta wants [to] want [to]. Celta lost matches eliminating Genk 4-3 aggregate quarter-finals. But partly Eduardo Berizzo, Argentinian head coach, resting players historic tie club: European semi-final. This escaped Mourinho, pointed safe 11th position La Liga. Celta [for reason]. Very good balance, team knockout phases teams level. It says semi-final, said. Because situation La Liga, situation comfortable, manage think just Europa League, rest players, maximum condition, it difficult match us. I do think they going come enjoy match. If case would played second team Bilbao lost 3-0 [on Sunday]. They lost matches La Liga playing second teams it clear come win. When United record Spanish opposition Berizzo, said: We hope statistics stay just wins away England. How beat Manchester United? By faithful are. I think team identity believe identity. A lot pressing, lot possession. Believing sustained attack. The way faithful identity. Vigo main threat rejuvenated Iago Aspas, forward failed score Premier League goal Liverpool years club. The 29-year-old 25 goals competitions, form led debut Spain winter. Aspas frontline includes John Guidetti Pione Sisto, year scored United Midtjylland home away legs last-32 stage. Of Aspas upward trajectory, comes Galician second spell Vigo, Berizzo said: More influence myself, Iago experienced personal maturity influence coach like me. He comfortable came [back here]. He matured lot. He assumed leadership side. Playing right liberated he able combine better centre-forwards Mourinho complained matches United played April Celta number. United injury crisis eased centre-backs Phil Jones, Chris Smalling Eric Bailly fit again. With United Champions League hopes Premier League place hands, qualification winning second-tier European club completion best hope. Mourinho said: In relation Europa League it important Jones Smalling come time. We matches week Celta, important back. In relation available Premier League it late past month played matches, seven Premier League problems, players [injured]. The perspective different Europa League important it good players options. Afouteza Spanish word seen Vigo leg. It translates willingness spirit face troubles possessing strength character so. The hope inspire famous victory United team meeting them. Yet uneven campaign United need special claim victory Spanish soil 58th game season. Berizzo added: More feared, Manchester United respected. We played great teams United definitely them, historically, clearly. But win conviction, identity heart, hope to. Back late November exactly months swapped Catalonia Turin, Dani Alves himself lying turf, clutching ankle fearing worst. Juventus 3-0 Genoa desperate contest, Alves charged Lucas Ocampos aim winning possession, Brazilian full-back left leg kicked Argentinian winger. It accidental collision Alves, taken stretcher. Pain etched face following Juventus announcement shortly final whistle blown Stadio Luigi Ferraris suffered broken leg  fracture left fibula, precise  reasonable assumption doing rounds 33-year-old play again. A stellar career new surroundings brought unfortunate halt. But injury grave suspected Alves able return action inside months. And months that, arguably delivered best performance Bianconeri Wednesday collective effort showed that, sometimes, really substitute experience. Monaco versus Juventus billed clash great attack built youthful vigour great defence carved grizzled knowhow. To extent semi-final first-leg played way visitors snuffed danger red white, notably Kylian Mbapp, 18-year-old striker taken Europe storm kick-off reported subject 72m bid Manchester United. It possible appeal spring evening Cte d'Azur player tested Juventus intoxicating mix power, pace, movement composure ultimately breach continent stingy rearguard, marshalled supremely 39-year-old captain inspiration, Gianluigi Buffon. It textbook stuff provided platform Juventus end pitch Gonzalo Higuan scored second goals knockout stages Champions League Alves created manner proved far finished. His assist came wonderful back-to-front team move. Juventus No23 involved twice, playing pass Higuan halfway line charging forward and, having regained possession, backheeling ball striker path leave simplest finishes. The touch sumptuous end sumptuous passage play come Alves 59 minutes Paulo Dybala stole possession Tiemou Bakayoko set free right touchline. After glance touch, Alves delivered perfectly weighted chipped cross post path Higuan, duly sent first-time shot legs Danijel Subasic. Alves assists season Champions League, bettered Cristiano Ronaldo (five), Ousmane Dembl (six) Neymar (eight), general, Wednesday showing Alves old, man provided Barcelona consistently potent attacking threat golden years. It fair wonder powers-that-be Camp Nou regret allowing leave free transfer summer. Alves 72 touches ball Monaco, utterly dominating left-back Djibril Sidib  who, fairness, playing injury Benjamin Mendy  showing level defensive awareness arguably come believe concession goal insult professional pride. In regard occasion Juventus entire rearguard shone, ahead Dybala, Miralem Pjani, Claudio Marchisio Higuan caught eye. The visitors fully deserved 2-0 victory, staggering sixth consecutive Champions League clean sheet, and, week return Turin, look course reach second final years. For Alves appearance Cardiff Millennium Stadium 3 June provide chance collect fourth winners' medal following triumphs Barcelona 2009, 2011 2015.

Arsenal right-back Nacho Monreal wanted man, Roma believed offering sanctuary Italian capital. Let say asked participate Twitter poll and, win said poll, chance play Super Bowl World Series? For sports fan, like no-brainer opportunity lifetime. But imagine professional athletes having participate Twitter poll order earn place event? Initially, little silly ask people devoted lives pursuit subject essentially popularity contest. Lo behold, though, LPGA traded credibility publicity, lowered itself, asking professional golfers participate Twitter vote sponsor exemption ShopRite Classic taking place month Atlantic City. The women? Golf Channel Blair O'Neal, India Sharmila Nicollet, Scotland Carly Booth Bolivia Susan Benavides. Of players, Booth accomplished wins Ladies European Tour. O'Neal won Golf Channel Big Break series capitalized popularity golf world personality, playing sponsor exemptions recently making cut LET Dubai tournament December 2016. Nicollet second Indian-born golfer earn status LET won 11 professional events Women Golf Association India circuit. Benavides plays LPGA developmental circuit, Symetra Tour, best golfer hail Bolivia. These women selected poll MVP Index, sports social media tracking firm co-founded Jordan Spieth father, Shawn Spieth. Sponsor exemptions tricky business. Typically, depending event, main sponsor golf tournament allotted exemptions award whomever please, amateur professional. Not agree exemptions given, that point: stir controversy event polarizing figure. This PGA Tour events continued invite fallen star golf, John Daly, play events, despite withdrawing halfway tournament shooting embarrassingly high scores. One certainly make argument deserving players selected candidates exemption. When I examined poll, I players undeserving, though. What I saw completely unlevel playing field terms Twitter followers ladies have: Nicollet roughly 357,000, O'Neal 77,000 followers, Booth 35,000 Benavides 7,000. In addition poll, I saw shameless attempt sponsors tournament capitalize social media presence female golfers regard false hope they setting place smaller following. Take Benavides example, initially wrote sponsor exemption. I just chosen way, said interview Guardian. When I told Twitter poll, I knew I smallest following, Twitter big country I knew going hard. But, hey, it chance play LPGA event. How I say no? ShopRite Classic executive director Tim Erensen went MVP Index search female golfers social media strong social media presence order conduct poll. He described thinking box Golf Channel, said poll help generate new people interested game golf. For naysayers, 10 million new eyeballs exposed event, that good winner contest, 143 players field. But let cut baloney. None ladies poll struggle looks department. They uniquely beautiful, strong fan male base. I urge accounts women nice compliments male followers pay them: Sexy figure. Wow, uber sexy! You hot! Fantastic sexiness. Cute hiney. Lovely curves. Nice pic boobs. Damn sexy body. If Erensen honest, say, The ShopRite tournament execs decided use women clickbait. Because, let honest, combined social media followings golfers, followings do total 500,000 followers. So Erensen says 10 million new eyeballs exposed event, he smoking really good stuff I want hold of. This transparent laziness attempt truly engage potential new fans. You know makes athletes interesting? Their stories. And know LPGA needs? A diverse pool fans, order need learn engage people outside pervy old men stalk accounts different female golfers. Secondly, just sad example women having sell short sports hopes receive life-changing opportunity. Sponsor exemptions alter player path. Should exemptee win tournament, automatic status LPGA following year, sponsor exemptions rest year. For tournament particular, earn spot majors left season LPGA. While extremely rare sponsor exemptee win tournament, happened past. On PGA Tour, Jordan Spieth won John Deere Classic sponsor exemption. Two years later went win Masters US Open. It gimmicky, erring tacky, despite Erensen believes creative thinking, it just new way exploiting women. As pointed social media though, Unfortunately, women sport tough sell saturated market. Anya, right critical company doing SOMETHING women golf. They easily throwing number male sports. My response that: Women sports tough sale sponsors treat women like objects voted. The notion just they doing SOMETHING good reason lazy promotion tournament. As long women treated like props sporting world ogled used clickbait, gain true fanbase equal footing men.

This ruthless, systematic shrewdly executed dismantling brightest, young attacking sides Europe. And showcased impressive Juventus. After 21 years come close stumble often, Italy dominant club sense European Cup close, Real Madrid await Cardiff month. An authoritative display Cte d'Azur, Monaco dismissed arena recently proved untouchable, merely fuelled confidence. This side time close. There conviction Max Allegri players surely wilt confronted Real current crop seasoned galcticos. This team struck perfect balance defensive surety attacking pizzazz. They remain unbreached knockout phase year Champions League  matches contests Barcelona normally irrepressible Monaco played  teased decisive goals time home just convincing reward imminent. There strength back, bite break Gonzalo Higuan, 85m forward justifying fee. The Argentinian double neatly taken Monaco defenders, split second play heaved suffocate Juve threat, gasped brutality all. I fight hard moments, said Higuan, scored times Europe season tie. I delighted goals. I just stay calm working hard, paid off. But is yet. That diplomatic. More telling celebrations, hands linked Juve players strung line delirious away support, final whistle. Beating potent attacking forces European competition felt like statement intent. Giorgio Chiellini Leonardo Bonucci tested Kylian Mbapp Radamel Falcao, demonstrated canny, occasionally sly, ability leave rival strikers bruised egos bodies. Mbapp, home side brightest attacking force, better player having experienced suffocation talent. Gianluigi Buffon World Cup squad 18-year-old forward born, Italy goalkeeper celebrated 100th Champions League appearance 44th clean sheet, fine stop near-post striker volley and, late on, sharp save turn away Kamil Glik header. In game I want I deserve play level despite age, said afterwards. I work hard day this. The day I quit, I want people sad it. We played great game today, exactly game needed survive Monaco great attack. We want improve day day. We close objective naive work hard possible now. Further forward menace Paulo Dybala energy Claudio Marchisio. Any lingering suspicions Dani Alves spent force level post-Barca shelved too, given blistering performance flank, collective laced quality. It perverse club won competition long.

There moments promise, particularly Nabil Dirar exploited space right-back feed Mbapp centre, Falcao wriggled away markers. But Juve pierced, potent threat theirs counterattack. Both goals exquisite construction. The actually stemmed Buffon short throw Andrea Barzagli but, sharp touches team-mates, Dybala soon flicking Alves free Brazilian slip pass infield Higuan.

There Higuan, permitted free run Tiemou Bakayoko, sweep first-time finish Danijel Subasic corner Dirar summon block. Bakayoko, coveted Chelsea, endured torrid evening protective mask breaking nose training. His suitors acknowledge he, like young team, work progress. Falcao missed best opportunity force parity, Leonardo Jardim, pacing technical area frustration, feared team wounded again. There warning, Marchisio eluding Djibril Sidib force Subasic smart save feet, lessons learned. Bakayoko duly robbed combination Dybala Alves right touchline, Brazilian easing free tangle legs space away Jemerson, floating gorgeous centre Glik far post. There Higuan slid score half-volley.

In recent years prospect playing Test cricket inched grasp Ireland like grapes hanging Tantalus finally dream looks set reality, two-match oneday series England starting Friday historic visit time men green seen current guise. Associate members International Cricket Council 1993 given oneday status 2006, Ireland buoyed news came board meeting governing body Dubai week. Subject approval June, path cleared them, likely Afghanistan, apply Test status begin new era table. It slightly overdue, says Niall O'Brien, ever-chirping wicketkeeper. But dream come true lad like small village, Sandymount, outside Dublin, played cricket garden brothers sister friends, pretending Alec Stewart, Graham Thorpe, Jack Russell favourite, Steve Waugh.

For Warren Deutrom, chief executive Cricket Ireland, mood cautious optimism. It outlook served time role, having overseen radical transformation past 10 years, beginning standing start late 2006 single office Dublin flanked governing bodies Irish community games mountaineering member staff  PA worked mornings week. It totally different dynamic now, says O'Brien, fulltime professional players Irish cricket map defeating Pakistan 2007 World Cup. The infrastructure changed people helping fully functioning cricket federation  things light years then. There fun element cricket, days expectations team comes responsibility. Certainly tournament upsets achieved past decade wild celebrations Jamaica St Patrick Day 2007, Kevin O'Brien almighty felling England Bangalore 2011 humbling West Indies years later, scenes building blocks place make Irish cricket viable business attractive career path players.

The summed honking statistic 2015 book Second XI Peter Miller Tim Wigmore showed Ireland earned $56,000 reaching Super Eights 2007 World Cup, compared $11m given members, first-round duffers, Zimbabwe. Test status is drawing money ICC, Deutrom says. It helping achieve bigger goal which, seeking make Ireland major nation cricket, make cricket major sport Ireland. It profile encourage boys girls sport maybe look aim higher pursuing career travel world. The timing Ireland impending Test arrival brings slight tinge frustration, given captain, William Porterfield, O'Brien brothers, Boyd Rankin (absent week injury) Ed Joyce  greatest runscorer  30s. There talent  Paul Stirling, doubtless come guns blazing week  sense results limited-overs formats petering World Cup, longest form game met transition. Niall O'Brien, debut 2006 35, accepts point highlights strong record first-class cricket seen Ireland win editions ICC Intercontinental Cup, albeit having recently replaced Afghanistan table crushing innings defeat March. Ireland course deal best players seeking careers overseas, Joyce, Rankin Eoin Morgan pursuing international careers England returning since. Test status, believes Deutrom, immediately stop defection pause thought line. Test cricket primary thing cited past players 20 years match pay He says: You fool say leave taken view that, blame others, look mirror say: Why do remove reasons make aspirational players possible?' Test cricket primary thing cited past players think 20 years match pay. And mountain climb, look control making playing Ireland attractive possible. Morgan, captain England Ireland fourth time week, certainly offered Test cricket main reason leaving country birth 2009, giving rise (perhaps fanciful) question day return Irish colours, say 2019 World Cup completed, end playing career. I actually that, Niall O'Brien says. It I spoken Champions Trophy World Cup finish career playing T20 leagues world batting Ireland Test cricket. We'd certainly love No4 make mistake I sure Irish public love wear shamrock again. He adds true O'Brien fashion: I ask Friday afternoon comes bat.

Next week Fifa congress Bahrain (but course), Infantino approaches reportedly brink second personal ethics investigation ascending presidency. His second! One admire ethics ethic. Then again, strong rumours  denied present  Infantino use congress push replacement Fifa ethics chiefs HansJoachim Eckert Cornel Borbly; development which, suggested, prompt two-year hiatus ongoing investigations, new appointees given sort timeframe briefs. Say like Fifa, it understanding place work. Broom-wise, though, newness Gianni reminded famous Only Fools Horses scene Trigger declares mistily he broom 20 years, mentioning it 17 new heads 14 new handles. As mate inquires: How hell bloody broom then? On this, else, I Trigger. No matter new heads has, Fifa president feels bloody broom. Like noted predecessors office, feels Gianni primary function sweeping crises carpet. Still, celebrate past year achievements moment: lawyer discovered failed sign employment contract took presidency  a compliance issue, eventually found, opposed ethical one. Ditto private jet flights took early months presidency. Occasionally, Infantino stoop things concerning actual football, duly instituted lucrative product-aborting 48-team World Cup. And now, according reports weekend Der Spiegel  denied  preliminary investigation ethics committee allegations exerting prohibited influence April Confederation African Football election. Perhaps explosively, senior Fifa powerbroker Sheikh Ahmad al-Fahad al-Sabah just resigned positions football, accused week giving bribes Guam FA president, Richard Lai, exchange votes support. Last Thursday, Lai pleaded guilty New York court bribery charges. He obviously  presumably precise moment  member Fifa audit compliance committee. Sheikh Ahmad insists innocent, humble service football crazy misunderstanding cleared  and, I say, Fifa traditionally hugely understanding place work. They love prodigal. But FBI announcing pointedly co-conspirators hunted in jurisdictions Asia, Middle East globe, let mourn temporary absence sheikh, heavily cultivated kingmaker reputation ponytail appeared overwhelmingly influenced Steven Seagal directtobargainbin era. The solace retains senior position International Olympic Committee,  believe  heavily involved getting Thomas Bach elected presidency. It lifetime service guys. For reason, IOC break silence unfortunate development, despite having quick traps cast morally superior fellow Swiss-based governing body past. Enough enough, ran Bach addresses 2015. We hope now, finally, Fifa understood continue remain passive. They act swiftly regain credibility forever dissociate credibility Fifa credibility football. So I sure shall hear custodian Olympic brand course. As matters preoccupy Infantino run-up congress, Le Monde week reported French authorities launched investigation award 2018 2022 World Cup rights. Last month Fifa announced $369m losses 2016, bigger hit forecast 2017. And emerged year World Cup Russia managed convince mere 10 sponsors it. Even malfunctioning Brazil World Cup 20 corporate partners stage latest developments Fifa story hardly likely stimulate rush. On hand, need worry unduly. Vladimir Putin Russia place oligarch frequently prevailed pick slack hour need. So expect bills paid way another. On hand, state TV channels currently refusing meet Fifa target figure broadcast rights, leaving governing body broadcaster host nation. So that Infantino eve congress. All presidencies difficult look outside  current occupant Oval Office thank unique insight. Even so, new broom quite useless old equal task clean-up? When I heard news Aaron Lennon, feeling sadness I do want experience I through. But feeling relief. My team-mate Leeds got crisis point I hit entered support opportunity address going on, rehabilitate himself live blessed life. I remember days Leeds really well. Aaron really quiet lad.

So car drive does prevent succumbing illness. That question proffered media, I think doing disservice viewers readership. The requisite level awareness understanding society people aware issue suffering need treated accordingly. The dialogue needs level understanding society. Let talk mental health issues. What talking sufficient support structure place. Is screening diagnostic process right does suit industry in? Those appropriate questions. Things definitely improving society whole, however.

So player comes professional environment understands football vocation sole identity. In opinion that legacy society. We ca blame NHS  they understaffed underfunded constantly putting fires.

Portsmouth, financial collapse administration Premier League seven years ago embodied English football reckless wage spending risks relying far-flung investors, rescued, stabilised begun rise ownership hard work supporters. A remarkable partnership forged crisis, existence club formed 1898 plunged doubt, beacon wider game. The Pompey Supporters Trust, structured according mutual, not-for-profit principles, raised money 2,750 members 48.5% ownership burden 2013, cooperation 16 presidents, local Portsmouth supporters wealthy buy larger individual shares amounting 51.5%. Ashley Brown, trust chairman widely recognised sterling work helping forge fanowned alternative parade financial investors left Pompey brink, appointed year chief executive Supporters Direct, exists enhance fan involvement clubs. Now, barely weeks Paul Cook led team League Two tough seasons, trust presidents decide abandon supporter-owned partnership moment success sell club. The proposed buyer unlikely today gathering international football investors: California-based Walt Disney executive, 75-year-old Michael Eisner. Eisner, having stepped 2005 chairman chief executive 21-year expansion Disney, runs modest series media ventures US company, Tornante LLC, Topps, sticker company, best known. He followed US investors rising fortunes English football year known looked clubs landing Portsmouth best prospect, making bid. Eisner plans interrogated Thursday evening Portsmouth Guildhall meeting supporters' trust members, vote determine sale happens. During visit, Eisner explained genesis investing English football pointing sport central position modern, ondemand media landscape: It thing make appointment for. He attracted passionate support Portsmouth club history acknowledged that, like US investors football, want return investment described daunting financial prospect. It investment children grandchildren participate in. We doing failure financially, obviously, reason doing it. His offer, divided opinion supporters, golden ticket star player wage Premier League status. Eisner bid 1,000 5,673 shares Portsmouth buy club outright, amounts supporter-owners paid buy shares fraught administration process 2013. Unlike recent 100m sale Swansea City, original shareholders 100 times initial investment selling US investors, presidents making personal profit, alternative long-term formula double money Pompey reach stay Premier League. With club chief executive, Mark Catlin, making public interventions highlighting need 5m pay improvements Fratton Park years, Eisner said invest 10m new equity club. The partnership agreement trust presidents set 75% majority shareholders required approve sale club. The trust vote block, determined simple majority 2,750 supporters paid members. Contemplating dilemma presented Eisner bid, trust board presidents' advisory board set key points consider, explicitly endorsing view way. The trust board said 11 members reached consensus recommend acceptance rejection. But letter makes plain series disappointments negotiations Eisner prepared retain trust ownership work supporter directors future Portsmouth board. Money, course, heart matter. The trust presidents agree club needs lot horizon wage inflation Championship vast financial advantage parachute payments banked clubs relegated Premier League. Catlin Tony Brown, Portsmouth financial director, issued advice, signalling clear view investment needed, cautioning League One clubs average losses 1.7m 2014-15, covered owners. The trust recognises 5m needed maintain improve ageing Fratton Park, 2m having spent supporter-owners, invested training ground. Minimal work ground infrastructure years multimillion-pound spending extravagant players wages financed loans owner Alexandre Gaydamak, Portsmouth FA Cup 2008 management Harry Redknapp. Pompey crisis precipitated Gaydamak stated following year unable subsidise losses longer club plummeted crowd financially driven owners Premier League club fall administration. So supporters' divide hitch club future Eisner Pompey money mountain scale sniff Premier League again. It details deal now. Brown said does believe sudden, urgent need cash trust planning new community share issue, envisaging investment existing new presidents, maintain momentum. Mick Williams, 16 presidents, says preparing vote favour selling, arguing round fund-raising supporters trust members necessarily generate money needed. My heart fan ownership expected money back, says, but fans weary fundraising just wo money needed club. If choose prospective owner could written spec Michael Eisner: he businessman, philanthropic, involved sport; it no-brainer. I yes camp. Pam Wilkins, trust vice-chair, speaking personal capacity, said concerned lack concessions Eisner supporter involvement. I do think it good offer, said. He getting stable clubs entire Football League, debt, little. After hard work we gone save club, running again, build training ground, promoted, I do think just away offer come along. I believe supporters involved football clubs, supporter ownership right way. Once it gone, that it, chance again. After Eisner visit rally support week, Portsmouth supporter-owners vote 19 May cede precious, hard-fought mutual ownership entrust promises future investment.

Let start Fenway Park itself, lies 4 Yawkey Way, street named honor Tom Yawkey, owner Boston Red Sox 1933 death 1976. During tenure, Yawkey earned reputation racist figures baseball standards times. Yawkey beliefs main reason Red Sox pre-expansion MLB clubs integrate. They African-American player major leave roster calling Pumpsie Green 1959, years Jackie Robinson retired. There reason Boston Celtics' Bill Russell, winningest player Boston history, keeps distance city legend (he described city a flea market racism). And yes things gotten better, yes vast majority Red Sox fans racists, yes Boston grown diverse decades. Still, recent census results remains segregated cities America. When fans say Jones incident does reflect city know, it they untruthful, it know entirely different city others' know. It just city deals segregation, it sport itself.

I feared worst flyweight champion world Lorenzo Lencho Parra I noticed scheduled six-rounder five-fight novice leisure centre Ibiza. My concern deepened I saw weighed junior welterweight. What doing: 5,000 miles home Venezuela, years shy 40th birthday, fighting peanuts 28lbs prime weight? As I sat train Madrid Valencia I wondered I end line. Lencho gone ground initial contact previous week, I arrived Joaqun Sorolla Station, I dialled number hope expectation. Hola hermano, Lencho answered ring. It dodgy connection accent strong I heard, I bare essentials instructions: I general hospital. Come meet here. The hospital? A 10 days fight? I had able news contest lost points, I had considered possibility endured beating. I braced myself worst. A short taxi ride later I hospital main doors, peering convalescing patient shuffle direction, light tap shoulder beckoned turn around. Lencho was hospital; just lives it. He looked unscathed recent trip Ibiza previous decades spent ring. He small expect flyweight champion be, stockiness built middle-aged heft emerged precipitated unwanted climb divisions. I notice scar curling corner right eye later tells clash heads football pitch ring. Lencho takes local bar begins story. I wanted footballer. That thing. And I good footballer, good play state level country. My older brother boxer. He scheduled fight world title 16 February 1989. But 31 December 1988, trouble street slit throat killed him. I 10 I told mother I going win world title Alexis. I going fulfil dream. Fifteen years later, just claimed WBA flyweight belt. He hard way too, defeating unbeaten champion Eric Morel Puerto Rican backyard. He 33 0. Unbeatable, like Mayweather figure day. My manager did want fight I told entire purse I lost. I hungry win knew I beat him. I knew I slip punches counter him. And I did. That Lencho fight outside Venezuela soon used fighting road successful defences Japan, South Korea France. A meniscus injury subsequent surgery stalled career 2006 and, returned March 2007, 15-month layoff taken toll. Unable body close measly 112lb limit, lost title scales Tokyo. The following day, Takefumi Sakata, fighter beaten twice, stopped round. Every champion loses eventually flyweights stay division entire career. Presumably, lucrative defences title, bolvares bank guarantee comfortable life Machiques? The I got paid big fights $60,000. Expenses came that. Then I bought house family started business. It decent money Venezuela, did long. After year effectively action, Lencho needed ring. The flyweight division distant memory making super fly bantamweight appeared him, WBA ushered match 122lb champ, formidable Panamanian Celestino Caballero, June 2008. At 5ft 11in 73.5-inch reach, Caballero giant weight towered 5ft 4in Parra. But Lencho smart, tough boxer contest alive going final round. I enjoying fight, tells reminisce. It hard work, judge round I stood 12th ready everything. Then referee suddenly pulls doctor look jaw. I moving it, opening closing it, saying I fine, decided stop it. It swollen I knew was broken. I broke jaw round fight Sakata I know that like. What like fight broken jaw elite opponent nearly half hour? It fine, Lencho says puzzled look face. You just fight. So barely realise? Oh, definitely realise! But just suck going. Two low-key domestic fights years sharp, Lencho standing sport WBO happy push straight super bantamweight eliminator future four-weight world champion Jorge Arce. The pair battled draw impressed given subsequent title shots: Arce Wilfredo Vazquez Jr. WBO super bantamweight crown Lencho Anselmo Moreno WBA bantamweight belt. Arce took chance, Moreno prime Lencho eighth successful defence. Eight months later I call, continues. It half-time final football tournament I playing in. My manager telling want fight Arce it decent money. When?' I ask. Next week,' says. I start laughing I 10kg overweight. But I took fight. Took it, lost it, stopped fifth Arce vicious body shots dug little deeper usual substantial midriff. Fast approaching 35th birthday, Lencho knew time pulled gumshield mouth referee count reached 10. That that. And years. But summer, Lencho returned. Weighing junior welterweight, stone heavier glory nights, eked draw 2&8 fighter stopped debutant fourth. Then, country self-destructing him, looked Europe. My plan bring wife children summer. Venezuela complicated now. It dangerous place. I seen people killed nothing. I saw bullet policeman motorbike kill child sitting him. Right business. The gunman stopped, pointed gun me, recognised rode on. I want bring family Spain safe. One thing boxing does lack middlemen was long Lencho shipped over. The day arrived Spain December, woefully shape world champion clambered ropes face elite European-level fighter Juli Giner. Already year fought times, including tune-up Andoni Gago Basque took Lee Selby O2. Lencho lost time: just opponent now. With plenty winks nods, Lencho describes new role. The expectations performance vary, fighting lose. It do paid. He says toys opponents literally held catching cleaner have. He smiles proudly I bring competitive rounds Gago Bilbao. He expected easy night, says Lencho. He mistaken. But smile soon fades. Lencho current status reflects finances ability. He reluctant details I know middleman withholding majority light purses. He proud man clear struggling. There light end tunnel, however, form link MGZ Promotions, Basque outfit reputable boxing promoters managers Spain. Iigo Herbosa, team MGZ, tells keen help Lencho short term finding decent fights long term moving training role. Lencho really good guy, says Herbosa. He honest hardworking man deserves treated well. He impressed Gago. We good match-ups then, character knowledge, employ trainer. As cue, teenage boy enters bar greets Lencho elaborate handshake. They discuss times places animatedly, kid leaves extra bounce step. One students, Lencho explains. I teaching things gym just park. He came looking like dad [the rotund punter standing bar] look him. If else, I healthy. Lencho good trainer time comes he ready hang gloves just yet. Once champion, champion hungry wins ring. I taken punches career. I gifted slipping punches softening impact. So I fight I 40  that years. All I said MGZ was, I want winner more. Please just let fight win again.

Some fans responded easier tolerate wearing Marseille shirt ban mean miss potentially difficult assignment home team. As turned out, Monaco won 4-1 Stade Vlodrome Mendy. But available went straight team. Because, yes, Mendy new improved version Monaco proved perfect match. Jardim ideal coach hone Mendy defensive wherewithal.

I disappointed, went home, spoke missus, like oh, that shit', I went away thought it, I now. Ireland v England massive role play it; Peter O'Mahony played way in.

Down East Lancs Road, Liverpool apparently resigned losing Philippe Coutinho. Never mind, let Isco! cried Jrgen Klopp, funster is, Isco quite enjoying himself puffed-up Real Madrid.

Sarah Storey achieved astonishing things: beginning teenage swimmer 1992 moving bike, amassed 14 Paralympic gold medals set extending record eighth Games 2020. But Storey taken arguably greater challenge: persuading government ministers councillors everyday cycling seriously. As British Cycling ever-increasing role promoting cycling means ordinary transport everyone, seeking medals speedy elite, Storey taken role policy advocate alongside Chris Boardman, gold medal racer-turned-campaigner. I ask Storey decided role, answer simple: wants children able cycle roads safety grow up: I got little girl who going starting school, way, I trying make sure opportunity kids older that it battle currently is.

It us, it sharing space was intended motor vehicles place, motor vehicles priority, realise nation health going way is, critical space have, having vehicles road is answer. Many commutes miles, distance very, doable bike, relative novice, Storey says, adding: But it situation roads prevents people doing that. With local elections parts UK week general election month, time getting message across, says: We going making sure new government new ministers, local elections week, people aware working hard British Cycling, necessity now, just congestion, nation health. One area particular Storey hopes push cycling people disabilities. She born partially formed left hand cycles adapted bike, spent years Paralympic squads people racing trikes, hand cycles sorts machines.

I think having Storey board fantastic idea  she inspirational, eloquent likeable. As Paralympian, Storey somewhat superhuman habit making victories straightforward rivals occasionally given wheels start turning. Let hope effect government ministers.

Bowing time simply style, goals scored, awards win mirrors glance admiringly, blisteringly quick year ago, Ronaldo shows sign slowing ways.

We energy does really matter play, said England forward. We sit back, goes hope. We want there, proactive, make difference impose whichever team playing. If do [earn home semi-final] it end world we before. Last season, Saracens finished table secure home semi-final thrashed Leicester 44-17 book Twickenham date Exeter Chiefs. In 2015, however, managed fourth place defeated Northampton Franklin Gardens prior beating Bath final.

Selby long fabled bottomless reservoir resolve, kept year final humiliation loomed: 6-2 session 10-4. He stubborn streak, iron forged difficult childhood. His mum walked family father died Selby 16. Is kind inner strength worked on, people do have? Yeah, I think work it. I think Ding [Junhui] prime example, says Chinese player took beating titanic semi-final Selby conceded felt empty going final eventually won 18-15 Higgins. I think look Ding years ago, people used sort used wilt little bit and, such, sort stop fighting, explains Selby. If look now, he Terry Griffiths, Terry worked mental state. I think Terry worked mental game showed semi-final far he come. I think he fantastic player. He great player before, I think he improved he worked mental state. So yeah, worked on. Now father toddler Sofia Maria, daughter wife Vikki, Selby hopes 375,000 pocketed world championship ensures family wants edging winnings season 1m mark. He big plans.

The Bernabu bounced burst song, lyrics ringing arena echoing words adorned huge banner unfurled south end kick-off. Tell feels, gloated. High north end, Atltico supporters sat silence, stunned. This felt terrible. It happening again, pain unbearable. For fourth consecutive year, met rivals fourth consecutive year fallen. There second leg Champions League semi-final like derbies Atltico thought left likely irrelevant, Zinedine Zidane insisted done. Football wonderful unexpected things happen, Diego Simeone said Atltico manager words thing, look another. This hurt too. There Real Atltico simply overcome; thing, city rivals another. Under Simeone, Atltico conceded 20 goals Champions League knockout rounds, including finals, Real. Three carried Real final years. They led relentless Cristiano Ronaldo. Five times scored Bayern Munich quarter-finals; times scored Atltico. It came score goals team played well. It complete performance, Ronaldo said. His goal come 10 minutes, 86. In between, Atltico manage shot target time season. Real past 11 goals competition come second half time goal arrived early. Sergio Ramos given time cross right, curling ball Ronaldo, hovering Diego Godn. The defender headed far Casemiro, hit ball straight back. He strike bounced Ronaldo, yards out, headed past Jan Oblak. The Bernabu went wild. On touchline, Simeone tapping head. Think, what? It difficult think times, European defeats seasons, difficult feel pessimism returning, inevitability all, cruelty. Much buildup focused psychology. If past weigh someone, let them, Real Dani Carvajal said appeared happening. Atltico looked rattled. Even ball  periods significant  lack conviction. They passed rarely intent belief; underhit. Koke swapped sides Yannick Carrasco, seeking control, improvement unusually imprecise. When tried thread gaps, gaps closed. One superb pass cut Real Kvin Gameiro racing area but, slowed momentarily, Keylor Navas sprinted and, diving length, took ball toe. When Atltico looked up, Real stood way ran right them. On wings, especially, Atltico struggling. Lucas Hernndez, drafted right-back, enjoying game. Jan Oblak sharp save Karim Benzema Ronaldo opening goal. After it, Luka Modric shot wide, Raphael Varane header superbly saved Benzema hit wonderful overhead kick just past bar. Atltico shot arrive half hour, Antoine Griezmann clever free-kick Godn sliding far post. Real taken 10 then, half progressed Atltico stem bleeding. They unexpectedly passive defensively little danger came forward, good news trailed goal. Real lost Dani Carvajal half-time hamstring injury.

Yet track field star produces equally extraordinary, inner detective moves high alert. We duped, deceived played fools times world record longer moment pure joy exhilaration potential crime scene. But Tuesday, implications radical plan wipe world European records 2005 began sink in, plenty sport believed start necessary sea change. One British coach told Guardian possibly best bit reform ever  citing, approval, plan strip cheats world European records. Another administrator expressed delight news. I spent 10 years amazed little counterparts care doping, said. So hats European Athletics president Svein Arne Hansen showing bollocks. It tacit welcome acknowledgement sport barrel-aged problems performance enhancing drugs. You did need GCSE bio-chemistry know female athletes eastern bloc countries Cold War era getting help. You saw giant-oak thighs baritone voices and, cases, read later Stasi files. Yet best law PhDs records struck books. Now be. As dust began settle, comfortable news. Jonathan Edwards, 18.29m triple jump world record stood 1995, admitted wished authorities buried old records together, radioactive. In sense European Athletics IAAF going make difference I feel I achieved career, told Guardian. It sense pride performance doing right way. I ca speak Christian Taylor, triple jumpers, guess doubt 18.29m clean. And important bunch sports administrators decide. The irony saying record dodgy, actions. Paula Radcliffe, women marathon record holder, said understood reasoning scrapping records, thought solution flawed. It better remove records sufficient evidence doping stand court law [Stasi files, later failed tests etc], place stringent conditions records going forward, added. But do punish athletes just era born performed in. Yet certain era cleaner past? Especially given happened Russia recently, anti-doping agencies warning problems places like Kenya, Ethiopia Turkey. And tip iceberg. In 2013 Dick Pound, head World Anti-Doping Agency, suggested 10% athletes cheating conservative number. Yet according official figures, percentage positive doping tests  1%  barely changed 1985. Something clearly does add up. Meanwhile 2011 Wada commissioned anonymous survey 2,000 athletes, estimated 29% athletes world championships year 45% Pan-Arab Games admitted knowingly violated anti-doping regulations using prohibited substance method past 12 months. The research heavily disputed, raises obvious problem: worth wiping records question marks ones replace it? Behind scenes, reformers acknowledge confidence track field, step wider package  including looking misuse Therapeutic Use Exemptions, thyroid asthma medication, corticosteroids competition lose weight. A zealous policy storing, retrospective testing samples bad thing either, far investigators hunt cheats. If Hajo Seppelt expose wrongdoing Russia Kenya, dozen ilk achieve? And testing far answer, probably would hurt leading athletes blood urine samples taken regularly tested specific performance-enhancing drugs like peptides, human-growth hormone EPO. Yet Pound bluntly years ago: There general appetite undertake effort expense successful effort deliver doping-free sport. Perhaps bit honesty senior figures would amiss either. We yearn day live clean athletics era, people cheat cheaters away it. Why open problems system? For now, truly know latest proposals represent new broom start clean things  merely blanket lobbed remnants track field embarrassing past. As Dave Bedford, broke 10,000m world record early 1970s, wisely puts it: It clear radical regain integrity sport. Whether right time tell. But work far wider set measures. Otherwise just PR.

The birth generation years ago, explains. It bit pretentious say I knew come like this. Circumstances right young players opportunity play.

The RLIF board gather finally confirm 2018-21 international calendar. The latest plan starts England hosting series New Zealand autumn 2018. That straightforward enough. The Federations Cup event place 2019 railroaded ARL obsession hosting Nines tournament instead. When place, work schedule it, clarified weekend. Given need fit final stage qualifying World Cup 2021, organising doing. In interview BBC weekend, Wood, Rugby League International Federation chairman, suggested Great Britain tour Australia New Zealand 2019 Australia travelling north Ashes series 2020. This makes sense sources tell originally discussed: England touring 2019 Great Britain revived Australians visit us. So fingers crossed Great Britain appearance 2007, Lions tour 1996, trip 2006 Tri-Nations. It time. Maybe cacophony hype surrounding British & Irish Lions squad announcement prompted RFL realising League Lions tour needed happen ASAP. Whatever Wood cohorts arrange, modern version proper tour, considerably shorter summer six-week, 10-game slog includes games Super Rugby teams. That like League Lions playing NRL teams Kangaroo tests. No wonder Graham Henry called suicidal. The players' union clubs, pay six-figure salaries, feet union Lions tour shorter week games. Before start saving 2019, remember heard before. Indeed, RLIF international calendar published 2013 Great Britain touring 2015 2019, leaving England play European Championship. Tear up. And given current plan Kangaroos coming shores successive years, keen on, smoke fire. Better news New Zealand considering proposal play France, Scotland, Wales Ireland too, tour year. That makes sense, given club season over, RLIF provide home nations wherewithal fly NRL stars need strength. If happens, make European Cup, run concurrently featuring three, Italy England second string, attractive broadcasters, sponsors fans. The RFL plan field suitable England team Euros 2020 2022. What happen home nations' best players GB squad facing Australia Ashes, anyone guess. Where holiday discover rugby league nirvana? I asked Danny Kazandjian, Rugby League European Federation boss, day. The Czech Republic, replied instantly. They got 11 senior teams now, Under-18s women. Nascent rugby league programmes growing sorts countries. Spain launched Under-21 side; Russia nine-club league student competition; Turkey just finished seasons; Norway seven teams play Sweden month; Holland four-team competition year time. It going Holland, added Kazandjian. They arguably best-governed member RLEF. A lot credit goes Kane Krilic, John Kear stepson. He got going going work RFL. Jason Bruygoms took it. Certain people RLEF history deserve statue built he them! And tams Jamaica, 142 games rugby league games played year, making fourth most-active nation RLEF members England, France Wales. That huge credit guys there, said Kazandjian. But fact half revenue generated domestically, outside funding. When Toronto Wolfpack finally make home debut (hopefully) packed Lamport Stadium Saturday night, opponents struggle mention. But Oxford RL decent season far, focus Toronto trip early week. Last Sunday seven-hour trip north-west, time Barrow, League One Cup semi-final. It well, Barrow showing Toronto main competition, romping 64-14 victory. There buzz knew playing Toronto away there massive emphasis Barrow game, admitted Oxford Scotland centre Harvey Burnett. We do know who going yet. The team announced Tuesday, usual, we involvement planning. All Thursday Monday work, I think managed. You going miss that, you?! Given hammering Furness, wish Tim Rumford safe journey. While scorelines League One alarmingly lop-sided, range club size Championship. Hull KR (with 8000 Featherstone recently) Bradford (despite bottom) getting times attendances London, Swinton, Rochdale Oldham. It like Scottish Premier League. However, haves nots meet pitch, contest fierce splendidly competitive. Part-timers Featherstone Halifax mix play-off spot leaders Hull KR beat Rochdale 24-16 Sunday. There different imbalance Ealing: London Broncos (last Super League 2014) 30 full-time players seven sessions week, Swinton (last flight 1991) 23 part-timers train times. Last Saturday 18 training borrowed Wigan recalled 11th hour, leaving coach John Duffy just fit available player leave out. Swinton, well-run small enthusiastic fan base fine young coaching team - worked Scotland Four Nations year - benefit greatly 14 May host Wigan Challenge Cup sold-out Sale. Finishing higher season ninth prove avoiding drop considered success. After impressive wins Easter, London Broncos appeared truly the, err ahem, horse galloping horizon raced 30-6 lead struggling Swinton Sunday. Not fast. As case teams playing Trailfinders' slope, Swinton fine second half, closing gap points 10 nervous minutes. Then Broncos' teenage sub Lewis Bienek skittled Swinton full-back smash way winning try. England youth cap Bienek played league Charlton Gunners latest product Broncos' academy, right winger Kameron Pierce-Paul Orpington, enjoyable time, targeted Lions. Broncos boss Andrew Henderson criticised giving youth chance sufficiently patient paying lip service London team London mantra. Yet players getting opportunity team stage. Even talents, Broncos Under-19s beat City Hull 30-18 curtain-raiser Under-16s gave Leeds good game the, erm, curtain-faller (Leeds winning 42-28). With unselected Kieran Dixon, injured Michael Channing Bradford Iliess Macani watching stand, week culminate Basingstoke native Mike McMeeken making England debut, little doubt Broncos London RL doing fine job limited resources. There current full-time rugby league players south matchday squad, unthinkable decade ago. Follow No Helmets Required Twitter Facebook The time Kerry Packer died Sunday 7 October, 1990. He heart attack polo match. Three minutes chukka slumped down, arms neck horse. He clinically dead stayed way brought life defibrillator. When Packer asked experience replied: I side, let tell son, there fucking there. When died second, final, time 2005, played clip TV interview memorial service. The good news there devil, bad news there heaven, said. There nothing. The moral, Packer suggested, want. And life, did. Packer collected tall stories like general does ribbons.

On Wednesday evening airing programme tallest Packer tale all, World Series Cricket. Ian Chappell tells TV director Peter Faiman, used live shows Packer Channel 9. When Faiman tried quit job, Packer offered money stay on. Faiman turned down. So Packer offered new job title too. When Faiman explained decision was influence affluence just feeling bad I kill myself Packer pulled gun desk said: I fix too. The World Series Cricket story broke 40 years ago week, early May 1977, leaked Ian Wooldridge Daily Mail. Cricket Circus' Threat Test Matches ran Guardian page headline. Those reports suggested Packer planning series Australia Rest World, Tony Greig, Derek Underwood, Alan Knott John Snow signed up, Clive Lloyd, Viv Richards, Gordon Greenidge, Andy Roberts, Imran Khan, Barry Richards Mike Procter. In end WSC grander that. Packer eventually hired 70 players 16 Supertests 38 one-day games seasons. Christopher Martin-Jenkins wrote with possible exception WG Grace  astonishing thought add caveat  there influential figure history cricket. It Packer brought coloured kit, floodlit day/night matches, white balls, drop-in pitches grown greenhouses. It Packer insisted players start wearing helmets, because, told Chappell: I paying lie hospital months. It Packer overhauled way game televised marketed. And Packer forced boards start paying players more. Before WSC, England players earning 210 Test. Soon it, 1,000. Packer honest this. It was love game. Is right went Supertest business make money? asked cross-examination high court. Of course, replied, I said else. All wanted exclusive broadcasting rights Australia matches. It took years win them, time changed game forever. On BBC, Chappell argues IPL descendant WSC. And truth that, way IPL packaged sold mainstream audience, pressure puts players choose representing country playing lucrative league. Like WSC, IPL forced sport accelerated evolution. There broader trends, too. Now, then, Cricket Australia finds itself dispute players paying them. The players today fish chip money, Chappell used it, Australian Cricketers' Association just knocked CA proposal pay AU$419m years, offer ACA say short change female players. Now, then, question TV rights air, Australia elsewhere. So currents swirled Packer WSC eddying today game entering stormy waters. The difference WSC means end. Packer wanted TV rights WSC shut down.

Lionel Messi, Sergio Agero Gonzalo Higuan older 30 time World Cup final: gone, replace them? The answer probably lies Turin, 23-year-old played Poland. Paulo Dybala won caps far  indicator congestion ahead ability  moment looks likeliest candidate focal point Argentina attack Qatar World Cup 2022. It elevated Russia year. Dybala scored goals created Juventus Serie A season, scoring 19 setting year. His goals Barcelona Champions League quarter-final took tally competition seven starts campaign.

That combination press PlayStation turn shot. He scores like that. His usual nickname, la Joya  the Jewel  given Argentinian journalist scored second game Cordoba Instituto 17, taking record club youngest goalscorer Mario Kempes. But really, like Argentinians, immigrant story begins long born. Dybala grandfather, Boleslaw, grew working priest Krasniow, village southern Poland 40 miles north-east Krakow. During second world war sent work Germany. When returned home jobs decided emigrate Argentina. He knew there, connections spent weeks sleeping cornfield finding work. His brother went Canada send card communion wafer Christmas. Boleslaw forgotten Polish letters translated. Boleslaw died Dybala impression grandson remains strong. When Dybala left Instituto Palermo 2012 needed European passport, initially tried Polish citizenship. The bureaucracy involved, though, proved complicated instead applied Italian passport mother family, near Naples. At Dybala enganche, play-making hook linking midfield attack, interpretation role conventional. As strike partner youth ranks Instituto, Gustavo Gotti, recalls, maturity efficiency way played. They say you kid great player past 10, Gotti said. Not him. He cleaned gave right pass. He played fast, simple  difference shots outside area. A little like does now. It 2011 real breakthrough came. Instituto youth went play Torneo Esperanza Alba, competition organised Colo Colo Santiago, Chile, coach, Francisco Buteler, decided push Dybala forward alongside Gotti. At reluctant, seeing himself great Argentinian tradition No 10s, end year playing team la Joya. That awareness roles key Dybala, play out-and- striker man. In sense modern player, complete forward, dribbler dribbles sparingly. The Uruguayan Manchester United forward Diego Forln compared Agero, accurate inevitable description the new Messi. But like Agero, Agero playing alongside Forln Atltico likely drop deep now. Dybala probably instinctive finisher compatriot range movement attributes probably greater. In sense player looked Agero become, player Pep Guardiola seemingly like Agero be, fairly orthodox (and highly effective) forward Agero is. Against Monaco Wednesday leg Champions League semi-final, probable Dybala play Higuan. The partnership, Mario Mandzukic Juan Cuadrado other, proved highly effective season template Argentina follow.

How immeasurably greyer sporting lives been. The thought occurred weekend, Nick Evans bear-hugged Harlequins director rugby, John Kingston, Kelly Brown treated Saracens' fans best post-match Bon Jovi impression, finest imports measured purely on-field deeds. Better, perhaps, gauge contribution size hole leave behind, simply players people, too. There shortage inspirational examples: Pat Lam Northampton turn century, Michael Lynagh Philippe Sella early days Saracens, Agustn Pichot Bristol Richmond, Dean Mumm Exeter. Then hard men: Olivier Azam Terry Fanolua Gloucester, Trever Leota Wasps, Jacques Burger Saracens. Maybe local lad contributed delivered no-one given more. Not signing works out, assorted reasons. For George Smith, Marcos Ayerza Andre Vos come pension. But reflect joy thrills supplied by, say, David Lemi, Sailosi Tagicakibau, Sinoti Sinoti Telusa Veainu, sheer thunderous impact of, others, Samu Manoa Louis Picamoles, impossible argue growth English youth stunted tidal wave mediocrity elsewhere. So, past 20 years, best overseas signings grace country pitches? Clearly imprecise exercise: calibrate worth calm, intelligent, wonderfully unselfish Neil Kock forces nature Picamoles Leota? What price under-rated, smart scrum-half Eoin Reddan Pat Howard Aaron Mauger, princely players broadened minds Leicester? The solution seek best worlds: great players generated just respect time England genuine, one-of-us love. The rule final drawn different nations. My quintet, worth, starts Evans, gave potential shedload caps All Blacks (albeit Dan Carter understudy) relocated London 2008. Harlequins tended different team fully fit Evans XV; distinctive high-stepping Hickstead-esque kicking run-up familiar match-turning passes drop-goals.

Players, players, implores, we come win, let Vikings know rules capital. The Vikings Real, increasingly answer us  sang course. Over years especially, difficult us, Zinedine Zidane said Monday. That quite understatement. They sang Atltico won Copa del Rey, beating Real Bernabu 2013; Atltico won league following season; hammered Real 4-0 league season that. They sang recently Antoine Griezmann late goal denied Real derby victory and, Atltico briefly hoped, title. For fourth consecutive league season, Diego Simeone left Bernabu unbeaten, having won previous  team done. They entitled sing it, sure. Over seasons, Atltico better Real.

He aghast seconds earlier Tom Cleverley punt, Stefan Okaka flick, forced loose ball far post centre-half lurked belt shot crossbar Liverpool lives flashing eyes. It actually hosts' best opportunity night frustration ensured overriding sensation final whistle intense relief away dugout.

His team merited this, Watford exasperation flag-happy assistant referee. Liverpool overcome early loss Philippe Coutinho dead leg, sustained fourth-minute challenge Mariappa, rhythm amid huff puff Adam Lallana restored ranks. The England midfielder two proper sessions recovery session, according manager, weeks thigh trouble, presence provided level reassurance. It Lallana planted volley Gomes punch minutes interval looped goalkeeper muddle bodies box strike woodwork. That superb effort trumped time remained break. They assured ahead, carrying threat Divock Origi and, late on, Daniel Sturridge Gomes saving both, appeared repelling Watford relative ease.

Walter Mazzarri ended slapping dugout team inability make proper inroads. There level grumbling dissatisfaction club season rarely embroiled relegation scrap. Watford owners sense time approaching managerial upheaval. But hardly gave anything, really, said Italian. They just scored great goal. The kind champions score. At end match training session years Sal guez left pitch, headed toilet pissed blood. Every day hurt, day risk Atltico Madrid midfielder stop. Nor, though, entirely leave returned place career ended  place kidney burst. That night February 2015 BayArena Leverkusen, barely able stand, departed arms physio, vomiting repeatedly way dressing room; stop seven times. Two years left arena having scored Atltico beat Bayer Leverkusen 4-2 course Champions League quarter-finals met Leicester City. When travelled King Power, having won leg 1-0, Sal headed goal effectively ended tie. Next Real Madrid, club Sal joined left kid, victim bullying.

I think start Champions League happens, Sal recalled. It worst night career, just injury itself seeing dad tears. Sal carried eventually withdrawn just half-time.

His teammates flew Madrid game Sal, previously suffered renal colic loan Rayo Vallecano, stayed hospital Leverkusen days blood drained. He play month soon returned. And that, seemed, that. Silently suffered. Publicly kept playing  impressively.

How happened, I fell, times I vomited, way body went convulsions, hospital bed I on, chair I sat in, team-mates came. And scored goal describes brutal liberation help Atltico through. I felt relieved. It took weight mind fear went away, Sal said. It hard family emotional scoring here. It special game. I came place I fallen. Another week Super Rugby passed Australian team beaten New Zealand 2017. That nought 15 attempts  point, Australia worst return history Super Rugby trans-Tasman clashes. Desperate times desperate measures. Why look hitherto unexplored idea outsourcing professional player development New Zealand short-term basis Australian rugby rebuilds woefully ineffective player development pathways? Should Australia send second-tier National Rugby Championship teams ditch participate Mitre 10 Cup competition?

Asked radical proposal sending Australia NRC teams play Mitre 10 Cup accelerate player development short-term, Hore said: Does merit  yes, does. It great coaches, great players enhance competition, said. The NRC actually bad competition. But want commercially sustainable  playing Mitre 10 Cup greater commercial sustainability, connect community. Hore, however, cautioned notion just silver bullet fixing Australian rugby seemingly terminal decline. He list concerns player wage inflation sits top. However, underpinning issues lack consultation collaboration state unions, Super franchises, Australian Rugby Union. Hore accepts game crisis Australia. He saying time.

Unsurprisingly, Australian Rugby Union chief executive Bill Pulver chairman Cameron Clyne sitting ducks angry mob spearheaded Wallabies coach broadcaster Alan Jones, crucified Cameron air recently. Jones left Cameron severely dazed confused, proverbial deer headlights. It stunned mullet look Pulver worn tenure game highest official. It clear Cameron Pulver do answers. In fact, people game big problem. Such distrust ARU provincial unions Super franchise bosses, it fair say pair prospects ongoing stewardship game damaged repair. Hore did names clear coming thinly veiled homage Will Carling infamous old farts quotes. It maturity level maybe age administrators world  we starting tired individuals, people do know about, said. At heart matter, Hore says, lack collaboration consultation. We do great deal collaboration. That big difference NZ. There feeling group [rugby administrators] intimidated consulting down.

Bottas victory complicated scenario further, however. The Finn clear believes challenge title lacks self-belief confidence so. He out-qualified Hamilton twice and, Niki Lauda pointed out, win hardest. The come easy, said Lauda. He proven win. Hamilton remains favourite pair fighting Vettel title Bottas genuinely credible challenger. While Vettel does look battle team-mate, Kimi Raikkonen, Bottas comes Hamilton begin taking points another.

On 27 August 2016, Philadelphia Union beat Sporting Kansas City 2-0 cloudy night Chester, Pennsylvania. Roland Alberg Tranquillo Barnetta scored goals, goalkeeper Andre Blake kept sixth clean sheet year. The mood team buoyant. The Union, years mediocrity, starting turn fortunes around. They just secured back-to-back victories, set team record home wins season. They place East, looking certain make playoff appearance 2011. Coach Jim Curtin could stop singing team praises. This good team, said. We shooting East  It going better. In fact, going worse. The victory Kansas City Union MLS victory 2016. They able sneak playoffs goal differential, promptly eliminated Toronto. Now, victory 2017. Their winless streak stands 15 regular-season games. The time Union got points, nation cringing Ryan Lochte frat-boy chicancery Rio, Sia Cheap Thrills song radio, Barack Obama president. What difference 247 days makes. Nor does malaise look likely end anytime soon. The Union drew 0-0 LA Saturday dour game typified worst scoreless draws. (The MLS website Four-Minute Highlights package muster minutes worth showing.) Philly shots goal, looked cohesive dangerous. Damningly, draw LA better performances season. They points games, rooted table. They tied second-worst goal differential league, scored fewest goals East. They managed draw Montreal weeks ago, led 3-0 40 minutes. They sole remaining team season win. If Curtin wondering high ceiling 2016 Union, concerned low floor 2017 version. This historically bad team yet, they precipitously close. If Philadelphia continue pick points current pace, they finish 17. DC United hold record fewest season, 16 2013. The longest winless streak MLS history 19 games, New York/New Jersey Metrostars accomplished 1999. (It also, 7-25, worst record MLS history.) Real Salt Lake managed 18 straight win dire stretch 2005 2006. And San Jose Earthquakes self-detonated tail end 2014, finish low note 16-game winless skid. After that? This current iteration Philadelphia Union. The margins far thinner appear. When team suffers completely extensively, instinct blame coach. Curtin pilloried rigid; refuses send teams conventional 4-2-3-1. In today MLS  tireless fullbacks like Seattle Joevin Jones Toronto Steven Beitashour overload wings create consistent offensive mismatches  Curtin teams look outdated underpowered, set fail whistle. It does help big summer signings, Haris Medunjanin Jay Simpson, look overwhelmed physical nature MLS, breath ideas. Then there question club record-signing captain Alejandro Bedoya. Before now-fateful victory Kansas, Curtin gushing Bedoya impact: To think he preseason scary thing  I ca say positives him. Flash-forward present, relationship tepid. Bedoya looked off-pace introspective time Union, peripheral figure edges team decline. Curtin playing Bedoya No10, conceded he I agreement is favorite spot. Bedoya himself blunt preseason said, I feel comfortable No8. This Curtin tactical rigidity hamstrings team: trying shoehorn Bedoya formation does suit left coach player dissatisfied. Curtin looks unlikely change formations, Bedoya looks unlikely produce lone goal he scored 18 appearances. Even worse man tasked Union chief creative force he register assist. There unspoken truth Philadelphia freefall dovetails perfectly Bedoya arrival. It probably correlation causation, patience Curtin nonexistent, fans start turn ire Bedoya. Throughout this, Curtin remained confident upswing just corner. He offered generic coaching pablums togetherness belief. But there denying looks haggard pinched. As said 10 April bitter home loss Timbers  problems large, insurmountable  the way win game.

It notable that, Philadelphia beat days ago, Kansas City lost twice. Death, taxes injuries Mets starters  life certainties. Just furor Mets' parade injuries seemingly reached climax news Yoenis Cespedes' strained hamstring 10-day disabled list, Noah Syndergaard pulled Sunday game lasting 1 1/3 innings. In era arm problems frequently shelve baseball best young pitchers  throw hardest  troubling news, especially given Syndergaard record past resilience. But Mets appeared poorly managed Syndergaard injury, allowing refuse MRI biceps pain scratched Thursday start, who blame Mets' team  injury troubles? Perhaps unfairly, injuries hit teams harder others, questions raised injury prevention management policies coaching medical staffs. This is limited baseball either; Premier League Arsenal attacked lengthy injury list. Emphasizing was speaking team particular, Dr Glenn Fleisig, baseball leading injury experts believes coordination communication important. I certain teams injuries expected, good job preventing managing injuries good communication coaches, medical staff analytics people. According Dr Gary Green, Major League Baseball medical director, critics easily draw conclusions limited information. People looking small sample size, says Green, it early draw conclusions need look long term determine trend. In words, statistical bad luck cluster injuries short period time, evenly distribute season longer. While little consolation, Mets' spring misfortunes, April historically month injuries MLB players. In fact, 2010 analysis MLB injuries 75% injuries occurred prior All-Star break. Adding that, research unable correlate workload (number games pitched, total pitches thrown, total innings pitched, innings pitched game, pitches thrown game) injuries MLB pitchers. Of course, injuries are simply dictated calendar. In fact holy grail sports medicine trying determine factors lead injury. I spent career trying answer question, says Fleisig. Unlike acute injuries  like fractures, concussions  it difficult come silver-bullet preventative factors overuse problems like Tommy John injuries shoulder strains. When data showed concussions catchers caused collisions home plate, changing rules prohibit collisions entirely eliminated cause concussions, says Green, but preventing overuse injury complex. Changing single factor impact overuse injuries, problems caused months, years microtrauma. Making difficult assign blame teams fact pitchers do come big leagues fresh ligaments tendons. By time players make major league roster, shoulders elbows stressed throwing hitting high school, college travel baseball. Without odometer indicate past usage, players ticking time bombs, exploding injury treated carefully major league teams. When looking ways prevent injuries biggest risk factors previous injury lot pitchers come MLB pre-existing problems, says Green. Because differences mechanics, it difficult compare risk players, says Fleisig. What easier understanding individual risk injury. For instance, pitcher throws 95mph likely injured throws 85mph. Absolute velocity weakly associated injury throwing greater number pitches high velocity  fastballs  does appear pitcher greater risk injury. Studies indicate MLB pitchers suffered Tommy John injuries threw average 7% fastballs pitchers surgery. Other velocity mechanics, Fleisig cites pitching pain fatigue additional risk factor injury. Velocity, mechanics pitching pain risk factors elbow injuries baseball. This red flag violated Syndergaard Mets disregarding arm pain week. Soreness significant Syndergaard told reporters that, Once gets cold, I could really lift arm shoulder. Though comes late year Mets, according Green, large-scale study MLB draftees currently underway. With data, sports medicine experts hope determine factors associated injury. Until solution baseball injury problem lie players' pasts. For second time days, final whistle brought Marcelo Vieira knees, time body did slump forward face first, fists beating floor; time body arched arms raised sky, like poster Platoon. After clasico late Sunday night, Real Madrid left-back took responsibility ended; match Valencia early Saturday evening, did  time actually doing. We fought, ran, said, wide-eyed wiping sweat head, shouting celebrating surrounding Santiago Bernabu subside. Ran? He run wild. Marcelo took blame losing Barcelona, sadly admitting fouled Sergi Roberto just Cristiano Ronaldo implored, quite easy quite obvious. Now, week on, rescued them. With minutes left, Madrid youth teamer Dani Parejo curled perfect free-kick tall, leaping wall corner Valencia level. The game drifting, Zinedine Zidane admitting anxiety, Madrid led. Now, lead gone, risked league doing likewise. With games go, Barcelona, Madrid probably beat Granada, Sevilla, Celta Mlaga wait longer title evaded years. Then, minutes left, ball dropped Marcelo corner area. He just hit swung cross box, that really way. So, dropping shoulder turned inside left foot, past challenges, bent right-footed far corner. 2-1. On touchline Zidane watched unfold moving, just jaw clenching, exploded. Marcelo sprinted Sergio Ramos, arms flailing, screaming, control, Tardelli Tarzan, leapt him. Danilo raced bench. Lucas Vzquez zoomed touchline pitch. lvaro Morata held him, let go. Players piled in, delirious. You'd think just won title, had. It felt way. This goal worth half league reports ran. And won seven leagues game declared half league really half league, point. Madrid again, way. Zidane talked pressure season reached end, legs trembling, looked like times too, familiar tale familiar finale: story season. They did really impress really, really to. Nothing makes productive minute. Valencia hit post inside minute, Fabin Orellana missed wonderful chance. Madrid taken lead  Dani Carvajal cross, Ronaldo header  chance came make safe second half, Karim Benzema hit post and, move, Madrid got penalty Diego Alves Diego Alves does, making penalty save breaking record: that saves faced Ronaldo now; saved single season anyone, ever; higher total goalkeeper history La Liga. Fewer 50% penalties he faced gone in. And went on. It 1-0 edge, lacked real edginess, Rodrigo headed wide. But Casemiro, yellow, conceded free kick Parejo scored, perfectly planned. Not quite perfectly. Sometimes it tempting conclude teams best way point Bernabu trail solitary goal, let game meander final minutes, score. Just thing: make sure score late there time react, will. Valencia did. I do know explain late goals, Zidane said, but it exciting. Madrid scored 20% goals minutes season, else, that padded fourth load easy wins. Against Barcelona Camp Nou Ramos scored minute; following week, Deportivo, making 3-2 92nd minute Mariano Daz equalised 84th; Villarreal trailed 2-0 came win 3-2, Morata scoring winner 85th; Las Palmas leading 3-1 minutes Ronaldo scored twice; Sporting fortnight ago, 2-2 Isco scored minute. And this. The Tightrope Kings, AS cover called them. Other teams too, course, has gone way. Sergio Araujo scored 85th minute drew 2-2 Las Palmas; Sevilla scored 85th 90th beat 2- 1; Antoine Griezmann scored minutes left derby; week Leo Messi that. But, still: fourteen times season Madrid gained points losing drawing positions (not including 0-0) late, seventh time they won game goal 81st minute, claimed draws losing positions period well. Which sound like huge that times it happened  quarter season. They won 17 points 81st minute  21% points  going week Toni Kroos Celta passing Morata, Mariano Ramos, Morata again, Cristiano two, Ramos again, Isco, Marcelo. Another miracle ran headline El Mundo Deportivo. We are; reach soul, Marcelo said. His soul this. Marcelo loves playing football, that held him. Just time. He grew playing Botafogo beach ftbol sala, indoor five-a-side, speed, touch skill, thing, grandfather Pedro started taking training VW Beetle, sold went bus instead. In post-game interview recently, Marcelo appeared seven-year-old son, Enzo. I want play, night bed, Enzo said. I like play score lots goals. His dad recognise himself that. After joined Real Madrid, played afternoon mates cousin, ftbol sala player. It supposed fun,  business fun suspicious, somehow. Do smile, do laugh, do dare enjoy this. But here thing: that bollocks. Defenders attack stand accused way defenders do are. The talented held task limited let off, talent itself problem, solitary flaw elevated hour half football. As committing fouls important thing player learn, passing dribbling scoring. Or, y'know, playing. Risks rejected, heinous crime, goal analysed inspiration does exist, ball end pitch exists, easily broken compartmentalised, area existing vacuum game itself. Yet taking risks riskiest thing all; sometimes, like Saturday afternoon, necessary. Marcelo left Santiago Bernabu wearing T-shirt Tony Montana front, played Al Pacino, line Scarface scrawled alongside: Who Do I Trust? Me. He recalled grandfather believed sell Beetle money Marcelo career, have believed. They now. It years ago joined Real Madrid. Monchi regretted it. With help investment fund, Sevilla sporting director deal lined Snchez Pizjun Madrid nipped in. He raw, skinny too, there. Marcelo admitted: I go, I go, I I forget come back, Gabriel Heinze Fabio Cannavaro shouted  and, boy, shout him. Madrid wanted loan Valladolid, sell buy-back clause, refused. He stayed. He played, too. There concerns, little resistance, club Roberto Carlos played  exploded traditional view full-back him. As coach it, Roberto Carlos player arrives area just happened, come love it. There touch Marcelo: times, caught; times, caught often. The space exploit, clear weakness. For Madrid, worry about. Fabio Coentrao came, up. Jos Mourinho preferred Coentrao so, key moment, Carlo Ancelotti. Marcelo left European Cup final Lisbon, hurt, came help change game. As Ancelotti assistant Paul Clement explained, decision natural: simply, thought Coentrao clearly better season. By following year, Clement admitted, bit matter-of-fact, thought Marcelo was. Over time, people won over, doubts did away. No Roberto Carlos way unanimity Marcelo, started accepted  quite apart improvement fact sport thought. Anarchy good thing pitch, accept. Against Barcelona, took blame, game like reduced moment did commit foul. Six days later, rescued side, game crystallised moment defined bit well. This way Zidane wants way: In modern football, backs make difference, says. In part, choice, choices come risks; downside everything, seen offensive players. The pros far outweigh cons. In team attackers tend turn inside, predictable, Marcelo Dani Carvajal make difference, Zidane wants  defenders Spain involved goals. This season, vital, lifeline. When B Team versus A Team debate comes up, entirely question. Their absences hurt club assimilated injuries remarkable ease better them. Marcelo different full-backs, attacking ones. While tend outside cross, likely diagonal line corner area. It goes people, just round them. It ball box, pass there. It pace power technique. Remember run Bayern? Jorge Valdano talks making flowers spring up. He talented me, Roberto Carlos says. After game, Carvajal revealed team-mates ran Marcelo, exclaiming: how good you? He'd good left back. And left midfield. And left wing. And inside left. A full-back? No, footballer. And amidst talent, really case declare Madrid best player season. It tenth club, lasts long something. He 28, feels like really felt like be. Season season, though, was. He arrived Bernabu 19-year-old. A decade on, Saturday evening departed having scored late goal took Madrid step closer title years 212th victory club  foreigner ever.  It beautiful pass, delivered outside foot near halfway line, right, wonderfully weighted, curling thirty, yards central defenders perfectly path centre-forward, bearing goal. It just pity Jos Manuel Jurado plays Espanyol centre forward gave plays Barcelona, inexplicably impeccable assist allowing Luis Surez open scoring Catalan derby complicated then. Espanyol dreaming Tamudazo, fuck century: chance title rivals Barcelona. Instead, given lead. And tense, difficult too, downright dirty, unpleasant chants again, does tend end way. I like coming here, Gerard Piqu said. Of 18 meetings league, Barcelona won 15 lost none. That assist helped add statistic, Quique Snchez Flores lamenting: That changed everything. After sluggish half, Barcelona took step second, Neymar running, Messi playing, Surez scoring. Piqu Sergio Busquets stood too. Ivan Rakitic rolled second minute Uruguayan got third, thanks blunder, celebrating gymnastic pose, standing leg. It announced derby league, Catalan dailies running headline again, Madrid late win meant remains hands, victory Cornell-El Prat kept Barcelona top.  It sad day; time time build, Tony Adams said. It day knew come. Granada 2-1 defeat Real Sociedad. When owner bought club did imagine this; let himself guided wrong people, Adams added. He wrong either.  Sporting Gijn are, yet, know they trouble. They beaten Villarreal Friday night Legans defeat Eibar means done, trail points need wins final games  got 12. That good news Legans, know they quite yet. We Legans, we just come up; love safe weeks spare know we going fight end, said Asier Garitano.  There cheer Alavs scored fourth goal Betis - Betis fans, enough. Disastrous, Joaqun Snchez called it.  Atltico eighteen minutes Canaries, Las Palmas decomposition continues, collapse coming complete. President manager long different opinions, players signed winter window did really need that, suspected, things worse, talks manager renewal inevitably broke team soon followed. It incredible seen team now, Quique Setien said. There glory games more.  Antoine Griezmann chance saw Michel Macedo down, kicked ball instead. Las Palmas fans applauded said nice thing do. Which was. But happen again. Much better celebrate referee booked Alen Halilovic Jes pretty pathetic dives penalty area.  And yes, El Mundo Deportivo really complain that, live feed game Bernabu, league o word Gol Madrid scored Valencia scored. And, yes, Super Deporte really pick story, describing shameful.  Welcome back, Levante!

Little wonder, then, Thiago Alcntara words players dressing room celebrating fifth successive Bundesliga crown travelling fans Wolfsburg were, according Sddeutsche Zeitung, throaty donde est el alcohol? Long season done, Bayern pick season costly defeats, defy comprehension different reasons  Real Madrid, Champions League week, Borussia Dortmund DfB Pokal semi-final. In context, specific celebration planned Lower Saxony Saturday, Bayern knew title theirs won late game  providing RB Leipzig failed beat Ingolstadt earlier, match finished goalless. Carlo Ancelotti team grabbed opportunity seal hands, taking recent frustrations strugglers pulverising 6-0. Wolfsburg actually got lightly, goalkeeper Koen Casteels keeping single figures. Given nightmare eight-day stretch cup exits, feeling inevitable clinching title anticlimactic, sort. It spontaneous fun, better it. It spread boardroom, too. By time 4-0, Rummenigge merrily enjoying pint seat alongside Jan-Christian Dreesen, club executive vice-chairman.

It emotion came victory surprised Bayern. It sealed full-time long, lingering symbolic hug pitch Ancelotti Rummenigge. The message clear gesture Rummenigge pronouncements days following semi-final defeat Dortmund. Ancelotti stay. The future, turned out, here. A heavy cold prevented Xabi Alonso involved, Arturo Vidal Franck Ribry bench, Joshua Kimmich Kingsley Coman  completed permanent Juventus week  came in, Thomas Mller. The gave best performances season, significantly Kimmich Coman instrumental superlative display. Besides Kimmich emphatic final goal Coman assist Robert Lewandowski score pretty finished game half, connected superbly, second-half moment Kimmich raking 40-yard pass sprinting Coman left, shot just wide. Bayern felt direct season. Kimmich ducked question asked ZDF post-match (and Coman) hard XI campaign, Ancelotti clearly anticipated thread. Next year, told broadcaster interview, they going play year. The future Wolfsburg filled trepidation. There communion fans, too, different mood. The midfielder Max Arnold tears eyes home players approached stands, clear hurt most; youth product Europe brightest youngsters team flourished, scorer Champions League win Real Madrid stadium just 12 months ago. Now, relegation play-off spot thanks better goal difference Hamburg. Even allowing Bayern excellence, make defining factor  Wolfsburg minus 19, compared Hamburg minus 29  shrink point discomfort. The coveted Ricardo Rodrguez nightmare centre-back was, words Wolfsburg Bayern striker Mario Gmez, men boys. It fellow Bayern alumnus Luiz Gustavo, initial clapping referee Felix Swayer given red card turned full-on rage meltdown. It David Alaba stepped clear Gustavo team-mate Daniel Didavi fighting losing battle restrain him. The coach Andries Jonker, end, came walk steps pitch, Brazilian sarcastically clapping assistant referee. It surprise Gustavo play season way things going, Wolves' green all. Insult duly added injury, subsequent free-kick Mller eventually scored fifth goal. Bayern showed setbacks present opportunities, evidence hard Die Wlfe having eyes, stomach, heed.  Leipzig coach Ralph Hasenhttl enjoy afternoon employers Ingolstadt much. The visitors chance, Sonny Kittel, rough, scrappy game 29 fouls, yellow cards red we 25 minutes net playing time half, Hasenhttl it. No matter  avoiding defeat Hertha Berlin week mean Leipzig automatically qualify Champions League given direct confrontation third-placed Hoffenheim fourth-placed Dortmund (see below).

Finally, huge reception returning Neven Subotic Die Gelbe Wand.  More trouble Hamburg, abject 4-0 defeat relegation rivals Augsburg.

Vettel, 86 points, leads Hamilton 13 Bottas 10 team-mate 63. While discussion Russia centered team orders imposed favour Hamilton, win strengthened Bottas resolve pursue title. He congratulated Hamilton, Vettel German Ferrari teammate Kimi Raikkonen victory but, relations Mercedes drivers friendly, does envision quarter given racing. It going long year, lot fighting, said. At point bit tricky tight. If comes championship fight, talking fighting track. Bottas mixed start season, having recruited Mercedes Williams January replace world champion, Nico Rosberg, retired winning title year. The Finn Australia, sixth China Bahrain opening meetings.

However, claim pole Sakhir followed comprehensively out-qualifying Hamilton Russia. The subsequent win gives impetus achieve more, believes. If do think win, stay home, said. But confirmation, result, matters. The races win times podium game. Getting win gives lot confidence it, I knew I ability. Now I just want again. It going simple year, it going massive fight.

It great match, completes season. Once more, is luck, know this. We know level progress we made. It greatly satisfying players fans. OGC Nice president, Jean-Pierre Rivre understandably proud team 3-1 home win Paris Saint-Germain. Sublime goals Mario Balotelli Ricardo Pereira caught eye young goalkeeper Yoan Cardinale superb, Nice focused bigger picture. A combination Monaco assured Ligue 1 title near-complete meltdown Paris Saint-Germain end match overshadow result, make mistake, Nice victory defending champions read valedictory statement hosts progress Rivre. Nice title race view tumble table 2017 weakening early resolve, unbeaten 12 matches, highly unlikely months ago. Indeed, time casual observer French football heard Nice probably 3-0 loss Monaco early February. Already Europe domestic cups point, defeat completed run win league took third. What looked charming story beginning season looked slipping away, team struggled lack depth well-heeled rivals. Most observers thought Nice worry Lyon, fourth, game hand just signed Memphis Depay. After defeat Monaco, Nice lifted canvas impressive 1-0 win Saint-tienne. There odd draw unbeaten stretch, including away Toulouse Sunday, team response face adversity hugely impressive. They endured season-ending injuries midfield tyro Wylan Cyprien then-leading scorer Alassane Pla, lengthy fitness problems concerning captain Paul Baysse, Ricardo Pereira, Valentin Eysseric, Youns Belhanda Mario Balotelli. Add Jean-Michal Seri stint Africa Cup Nations young centre-back Malang Sarr dramatic loss form, Nice form minor miracle. Much credit Lucien Favre, used ingenious variety tactics manage absences. The team started season playing 4-3-3 moving back. More recently, absence Cyprien, moved 4-2-3-1. Pereira, brought right-back, used orthodox winger, allowed Seri push forwards. A defensive midfielder arrival, Ivorian revelation season attacking role, 10 assists goals. Favre given expanded roles players afterthought season early going. Along Dante Belhanda, Mario Balotelli big-name arrival summer. There intrigue promising Cyprien Arnaud Lusamba, Arnaud Souquet afterthought. A youth international France, product Lille academy just years ago himself playing amateur Poir-sur-Vie. Success saw earn Dijon, playing Ligue 2, key team promotion season. Still, though, hardly expected play handful matches season, Pereira unquestionably choice. When Pereira forced miss month knee injury January, Souquet, played handful matches, stepped up. He played minute Ligue 1 deployed makeshift centre-back team trip Parc des Princes. Now played right-back, impressive attacking threat, having contributed assists season. Another Ligue 2 player, Maxime Le Marchand important Nice signing Le Havre 2015. Like Souquet, destined bigger things young age, having won Coupe Gambardella, France youth cup competition, Rennes team included Yacine Brahimi Yann M'Vila. However, failing break team, forced level. Initially left-back, Le Marchand impressed centre-back campaign suffering recent hamstring injury ended season, invaluable deputy Baysse captain recent spell sidelines. Eysseric falls category, contributing assists goals 2017 starting just times half season, pattern apparent exceptional recruiting apparatus. Admittedly, Chinese backing key Nice able pay wages Balotelli, Dante Belhanda, real secret team success lies scouting department. Nice splash 5m Cyprien summer (a figure pittance season), combined cost Seri, Le Marchand, Pla, Souquet, Baysse Dalbert 6m. One argue paltry fees means Ligue 1 clubs, Nice sold important players recent past, bringing handsome returns Jordan Amavi Nampalys Mendy. In way, Nice, scouting department, headed Serge Recordier, seen success built eye sustainability. Since Rivre joined 2011, club placed focus academy, building new training centre allowing sustain success face significant departures. As Cardinale told RTL recently: Last summer, lot uncertainty dressing room departure scorers, [Hatem Ben Arfa Valre Germain] captain [Nampalys Mendy] coach. In end, though, worked great. We accomplished historic we setting limits. Yesterday win bold affirmation club over-arching strategy. As Nice prepare looks set place Champions League play-off rounds, tough decisions make Balotelli (out contract), Belhanda (an option buy reported region 9m) Pereira, loan set expire. There questions surrounding ability Cyprien Pla recover injuries, considers Nice situation, though, likely combination Favre, Fournier Recordier looks set success reach.  The consistent stream new thrilling young players exciting aspect French football. Kylian Mbapp compelling development months astonishing, form player truly lived hype similar age just brilliant teenage Monaco forward displays campaign. Florian Thauvin swaggering hat-trick Marseille 5-1 demolition relegation threatened Caen high-point stunning season. Despite Thauvin arrogant, lazy reputation England, intensity, attitude work-rate exemplary Rudi Garcia campaign. So won Didier Deschamps March beat Mbapp Ligue 1 Player Month award. The 24-year-old admitted recently questioned himself trying spell Newcastle, confidence returned France stirring effect. 15 goals scored places 5th Ligue 1 scoring charts coupled seven assists, Thauvin importance Marseille clear, regularly outshining Dimitri Payet return West Ham. But crucially Thauvin renewed faith undoubted ability shines performances. The nonchalance effortless grace took superb strikes Sunday lunchtime unerring pace intensity possession Garcia delighted Marseille forced activating player 11m purchase option owing games played clause loan agreement Newcastle.  When Monaco centre-back Jemerson scuffed clearance path Toulouse Ola Toivonen early second half Stade Louis II Saturday afternoon, allowing Swede slot home 1-0, title race shifting PSG direction. The half was, Monaco standards, stilted blunt and, despite Jardim decision sacrifice Coupe France (resting entire team mid-week semi-final PSG, B team string lost 5-0), Monaco looked tired. A response Champions clichd description comeback, began feel like Monaco close unstoppable domestic Kamil Glik slammed home header equalise seconds later. The effervescent Kylian Mbapp arrowed home lead 15 minutes after, 22 goals 20 starts teenager unbelievable form continues, Thomas Lemar sure Monaco managed customary goals Ligue 1 match stayed points clear PSG. But 5-0 thumping Monaco received PSG Jardim astute week. Monaco looked little weary time recent months. Their comparatively small squad, busy schedule action style begun catch them. In contrast, humiliation Barcelona, PSG returned swaggering best Ligue 1 dispensed admittedly Fabinho-less Monaco League Cup final, 4-1. As result, Jardim picked strongest XI Coupe France semi-final week, PSG favourites Parc des Princes, strong. By sacrificing Coupe France, Jardim gave team needed rest simultaneously covertly sidestepped potentially confidence, momentum energy draining defeat rivals; key psychological aid looks like title win Les Monegasques.  End season awards shortlists definition subjective business French professional footballers body, UNFP, released various lists accolades week, questions raised. The UNFP long criticised supposed big club bias, number PSG nominations year surprising standards. The perennial champions represented four-man shortlists, curious situation comparatively poor season fluctuating form. Edinson Cavani, league scorer, justifiably joins Bernando Silva Alexandre Lacazette contention Player Year. However, absence Monaco sublime midfield general Fabinho favour Marco Verratti verging ridiculous. Fabinho Monaco important player difference performances domestically Europe stark. His power, drive pace help partner Tiemou Bakayoko dominate midfield battles despite outnumbered range passing, vision creativity drive forward. Without Ligue 1 omission baffling oversight. Verratti good Christmas form genuinely best players planet, Fabinho season, winner. Jardim Nice Lucien Favre obvious inclusions managerial list Jocelyn Gourvannec deft nurturing young Bordeaux 5 earns deserved place alongside them. Yet Unai Emery appearance shortlist verged incomprehensible side ill-disciplined, chaotic loss Nice Sunday evening, looks laughable. This season regression PSG. Yes, retain treble yes, domestic award, humiliation Barcelona theoretically affect decision making. However, PSG long spells brittle, lethargic complacent best form seen play swaggering best largely come home weaker sides, chasm available resources personnel rival clubs 31-point margin victory season Blanc huge caveats league second best side return form. More point, Emery little discernible influence displays, doing little making Laurent Blanc look good. This eviscerate Emery, Monaco current form precious coaches deal (although Lyon title push 2014/15 dissimilar) CV superb one, winning consecutive Europa League title Sevilla credentials 2016/17 Ligue 1 shortlist best.

When negotiated contact Durham, Jennings insisted clause allowing leave county relegated chose remain loyal. It tough time Durham. But tough people stand tough times around. There lot tough people club like Colly [Paul Collingwood] felt right stand them. And Sir Ian Botham came board [as chairman] easier. Somebody knowledge aura offer. He chatted dad settled us. We going good crack year. The vibe actually brilliant young fresh group. Durham sweetened Jennings decision making captain 50-over team, Collingwood remains charge county side. Colly incredible human being. So, leading us, team 100% upbeat. If had got 48-point penalty maybe bounced straight cards dealt. Jennings played different hand choosing commit himself England. It decision which, guided father, proud South African, steeped pragmatism. England offers Jennings greater stability opportunity carve significant Test career. Some accuse mercenary Jennings fine batsman, strong mentality, speculation England captain. It significant asked lead Lions recent tour Sri Lanka. This season, continued impressive run-making past scores 102no, 87, 30no, 79 139  latest scored Monday 50-over match Warwickshire. He likely retain place Test South Africa summer  debate nationality intensify. I expected negativity, Jennings says recalling response Test century. But I did expect quantity criticism far. Lots people got involved social media  including really big names  caused massive ripple effect. People arguing me. Some articles nasty words, articles really nice words. The majority nice it hard think nasty 20%. At time, social media given people voice reach admire hate. You got good bad I know I right decision. How South Africa players react? It probably divided terms understanding unhappy me. It does really bother think totally honest. I sure they going friendly field, way be. Jennings confirms close links South Africans. He opened batting years Quinton Kock school Johannesburg. Quinton interesting character, really nice bloke. He seriously talented. I remember making deal head sport. If got hostel master free weekend leave Friday afternoon. There were matches did hundreds. I played Vernon Philander. I obviously played Cooky [Stephen Cook, Jennings opened batting Gauteng Durham]. Cooky family lot me. Morne Morkel grew playing dad I lucky little sprog running drinks Morne [his brother] Albie, touch Durham. Albie link moving here. His face lights returns memories Mumbai Test soon arriving India. All emotions poured  pride, happiness, relief You it!' I reached point kid dreams of. It sensational. Jennings choice shot says  because, cautious batsman, reached century reverse sweep. I play season I scored lots runs doing it. A days Test we'd practised square I'd nailed times 10. But camera caught top-edging hit face. A tweet went shot people said: What doing playing shot?' That doubt gets created opinions it best shots. Just I got I played missed. I thought: I ca caught slip 96. I'd playing reverse sweep I'd backed myself. So chance came felt like moment. I went thankfully hit middle bat. Jennings beams reflective. One biggest things came unconditional love family. My dad got chance play Test cricket [because sports boycott apartheid]. My brother Dylan first-class cricketer got chance. The love support gave  selfish bitter  special. It gives goosebumps now. My dad come India  loved [because coached IPL]  did want distract me. That incredibly selfless. I did realise impact father India night England went dinner sponsors big [Indian] stars. For hours I got grilled dad. What favourite food? What time does up? What does gym?' I realised impact he'd India decision come heat me. So parents Mauritius watching TV. I 96 TV went blank. My dad pacing outside. Next thing text came clapping hands. Then knew. When power came I 110  got balls later. Jennings laughs  does reminder lasted ball second innings. I walked said: Mother Cricket, sick sense humour.' A family friend sent text: A people got 100 nought debut. But you guy that got 100 first-baller. Well done.' That laugh. In Test, Chennai, Jennings scored reassuring 54. He works closely uncle, Ken, sports psychologist sounds impressively philosophical. One Ken biggest things lows high highs low. If 100, beer run bed. Do exact thing naught. That really helped me. I remember conversation dad. He said: If you going play cricket worrying getting dropped up. Go actually enjoy.' I realised then: Let just enjoy it. If I going defend, let defend. If I going drive, let drive. Just commit choices.' I clicked. Jennings admires Kumar Sangakkara, intelligent men world cricket, takes chance talk magisterial Sri Lankan. I remember having chat Kumar Sussex. He told me: You allowed make mistake.' It obviously simple powerful Kumar. I lucky lunch Sri Lanka. We went restaurant, Ministry Crab, I loved fact interests. Sanga played 20 years got millions 100s. But he interesting bloke. He human being. Sangakkara given Jennings confidence open ambitions. His overriding goal score huge Test runs does flinch asked possible future role England captain. I enjoyed captaincy Rooty [Joe Root] right person 10 years. I'd love play opportunity came line I would say no. It depends performance. To lead privilege. I got captaincy Durham couple weeks [of 50-overs cricket] exciting. Jennings looks deserted Riverside anguish relegation 48-point penalty forgotten. My dad texted morning. He said: Are satisfied yet?' There saying, How hungry you?' He pushing make sure you satisfied you hungry more. And that I am. I want better. Pescara Ghanaian midfielder Sulley Muntari abandoned pitch Sunday, saying booked complaining racist chanting crowd team 1-0 defeat Cagliari Serie A. Muntari shown yellow card dissent referee Daniele Minelli 90th minute walked pitch protest stoppage time, leaving team play minutes 10 men. The 32-year-old told television reporters group fans insulting start match, including group children. He said offered children shirt set example insults continued second half. There little kid doing parents standing nearby, said Muntari, played Portsmouth spent season loan Sunderland. So I went told it. I gave shirt, teach you supposed things like that. I needed set example grows nice. [The referee] told I talk crowd. I asked heard insults. I insisted courage stop game, Muntari added. The referee just stay field blow whistle, everything. He aware things set example. I victim. But stop matches I convinced things wo happen more. Italy struggled stop racist chanting stadiums number incidents years. In 2013, Milan team abandoned pitch friendly town Busto Arsizio home fans insulted midfielder Kevin-Prince Boateng. Under guidelines introduced following incident, referee supposed alert fourth official turn report incident public security department responsible policing games. The Pescara coach, Zdenek Zeman, said sympathised Muntari said player walked off. Muntari abandoned pitch racist chants justice hands, said. We talking racism years happens. Today, happened Muntari playing Italy years now. We need change mentality. What Francesco Totti thinking walked pitch Stadio Olimpico Sunday, hand stroking stubble? Was saying goodbye, head, fixture meant him? Was asking, like rest us, can really end like this'? We reminded, week leading Derby della Capitale, impact city. Totti boot sponsors, Nike, prepared special set golden footwear wear Lazio. At decidedly cheesy release event, placed throne. The steps leading seat carried names seven monarchs ruled Rome 753 BC 509 BC. Fans journalists long referred Totti eighth king' city. From debut today, reign endured little 24 years, longer 32% Serie A players alive. Before Sunday, Totti played 43 derbies. He left mark goals celebrations followed. His 25-yard cucchiaio' seal 5-1 win 2002 soon forgotten, various T-shirts, sucked thumbs, simulated childbirths selfie Curva. This latest derby, though, wish discard memory quickly possible. Totti spoken boot launch games Lazio felt different, saying set beat neighbours destroy them. It team, though, wind getting obliterated weekend. Roma began day faint title hopes. Juventus draw Atalanta Friday opened door close points league leaders  host month. The Giallorossi form, too, having won seven games (and drawn one) kicked March slump. Lazio, contrast, lost little momentum, defeat Napoli effectively ending ambitions finish three. They suffered blow build-up kick-off Sunday, scorer Ciro Immobile ruled fever. In absence, Keita Bald left start front. Perhaps blessing disguise, Simone Inzaghi simply Roma number. He outwitted Luciano Spalletti semi-final Coppa Italia, here. Lazio 3-5-1-1 perfectly structured counteract opponents tendency overcommit, allying defensive solidity varied options break. Jordan Lukaku Dusan Basta offered tireless running flanks, Lucas Biglia just effective carving straight middle Roma midfield. Keita pace forced Roma defenders heels, left space Sergej Milinkovic-Savic dictate play lines. After brief moment Roma pressure start game, Keita Lazio front, teasing Federico Fazio edge box drilling shot Emerson legs corner. Were horrible refereeing, game won. After dismissing strong penalty shout Lazio, referee Daniele Orsato compounded mistake awarding Roma Kevin Strootman dived shamelessly stroke half-time. Daniele De Rossi slow-mo conversion briefly match balance. But Basta restore Lazio lead just minutes second-half, Keita 3-1 late on. Totti entered game in-between Lazio goals. He warming midway half, bouncing stretching spring sunshine. As jogged place De Rossi, TV cameras picked fans tears eyes. Totti confirmed final season player, Roma general manager Mauro Baldissoni suggested reminded reporters kick-off captain six-year contract serve club director waiting him, so he live derbies, they pitch. Surely, though, iconic player quietly. Totti started just single league game Roma season, what? Was flash magic golden boots his? Alas, no. The closest Totti came making real impact game shot charged outside box. If image capture afternoon, probably nutmegged Biglia midfield. Perhaps play derby. Asked left stadium one, Totti suggested other people ones making claims. But given clear indication does intend return. And decision, case, taken away club offer playing contract. Either way, defeat felt like end era. Spalletti, having brought optimism returned Roma January, fallen short stated goal winning trophy season. He regret past proclamation I win something, I go, does appear club preparing start over. Monchi appointment sporting director confirmed, linked bring Sevilla colleague Unai Emery manager. Whether Totti retires not, playing squad likewise expected undergo significant overhaul. That contrast Lazio, doing power summer existing group together. They stumbled good accident  Inzaghi earning promotion caretaker full-time manager summer club contrived hire lose Marcelo Bielsa space days  lot like team. The (counting goalkeeper Thomas Strakosha) Sunday 25 under, Wesley Hoedt bringing average age came bench replace fellow Holland international Stefan De Vrij. Milinkovic-Savic, enjoying breakout season No10 role, 22 years old, Felipe Anderson, deployed impact sub despite leading Lazio assists, just 24. Inzaghi shaped sum parts, team dynamic, exciting, flexible  having switched formations regularly fit opposition. The Champions League season, looking forward relish Coppa Italia final Juventus. By beating Roma Sunday, furthermore, Lazio ended run four-and-a-half years derby win Serie A. We say group upstarts ended reign eighth king Rome. But certainly refused kneel him.  A grim spectacle Sardinia, Sulley Muntari walked Pescara 1-0 defeat Cagliari racially abused section crowd. He responded initial provocations going speak group half-time, apparently giving shirt young fan attempt set example. But abuse persisted, different group getting involved, called referee fourth official stop match. Instead, wound getting shown yellow card. That I got angry, said Muntari afterwards. Why, instead stopping match, turn me? The fans messed up, referee different - accuse me. I victim. But stop matches I convinced things wo happen more.  That Atalanta draw Juventus point taken Bianconeri years. They fortunate away penalty Rafael Toloi handled area (and feels like opportune moment note that, chatter Juventus getting favourable decisions, Roma received 10 penalties champions Serie A season) required 89th minute equaliser, felt like result earned stolen. There greater testament work Gian Piero Gasperini Bergamo fact players feel confident stand toe-to-toe opponents games this.  Crotone continue rage dying light, drawing home Milan taken points games Juventus. Milan, meanwhile, won just stretch.  That better Inter, defeat Napoli means taken point games. It surprise outplayed Napoli San Siro, team capacity self-inflicted harm highlighted Yuto Nagatomo gifted ball Jos Callejn game goal. Results: Atalanta 2-2 Juventus, Bologna 4-0 Udinese, Cagliari 1-0 Pescara, Crotone 1-1 Milan, Empoli 1-3 Sassuolo, Genoa 1-2 Chievo, Inter 0-1 Napoli, Palermo 2-0 Fiorentina, Roma 1-3 Lazio, Torino 1-1 Sampdoria Among plenty discussion Arsne Wenger decision abandon four-man defence used 20 years favour notable Mauricio Pochettino Tottenham essentially playing systems simultaneously 2-0 north London derby win. Eric Dier ability play defence midfield meant Spurs seamlessly switched systems, nullifying Arsenal major attacking threat putting control. Spurs 4-2-3-1 3-4-3 but, full-backs Kieran Trippier Ben Davies flying forward, Dier dropped defensive midfield role deeper, right-of-centre positions stop Arsenal finding Alexis Snchez quickly. I think today flexibility tactics game, said Pochettino afterwards. How back, back, midfielders, used full-backs higher close inside like midfielder. At times Tottenham flexibility works efficiently shape transcends numerical formations. Arsenal offered defensive numbers half Wenger admirably compact, refusing let Christian Eriksen space lines. They suffered wider areas, however, Tottenham built play left, Mesut zil, keen defender particularly comfortable wide. Tottenham best first-half chances curiously similar, Dele Alli Eriksen missing point-blank range far post, deflections fell invitingly. It underlined half: Spurs scrappy game. Arsenal performance similar first-half display Manchester City Wembley weekend, unable sustain possession opposition half, wing-backs spending longer defence midfield. Their best moments half-time arrived took leaf Tottenham book pressed advanced positions force turnovers  Hugo Lloris forced goal palm ball away Kieran Gibbs, Aaron Ramsey attempted decent low curling shot just outside penalty box. It surprising Wenger fielded Olivier Giroud upfront Premier League aggressive defensive line  Frenchman excellent centre-forward playing close opposition area Arsenal looked dangerous centre-forward runs turns opposition. It surprise Danny Welbeck introduced Arsenal goals down. At half-time Pochettino demonstrated Spurs' versatility switching attacking midfielders. Heung-min Son moved left right, Eriksen shifted centrally Alli started left. But players allowed freedom dovetail, breakthrough came Eriksen good work right Alli close-range finish. The centre-forward Harry Kane relatively quiet game, battling centre-backs own, drew foul Gabriel scored second penalty spot, maintaining excellent record fixture. Eventually Wenger turned Welbeck, replaced Granit Xhaka, fielded flank upfront. This meant Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain moving central midfield role Wenger reverted 4-2-3-1, natural centre-back Gabriel played right-back natural left-back Nacho Monreal centre-back. It felt worryingly disjointed comeback rarely looked likely. The game stop-start  bookings 70 minutes, minutes  suited home side. Indeed Spurs extended lead; Petr Cech far busier opposite number Arsenal best performer here. The 2-0 victory confirms Tottenham finish Arsenal time Wenger took charge Pochettino keen state Spurs far loftier ambitions that. In truth, Arsenal St. Totteringham Day' celebrations pronounced years were regular title challengers, consolation genuine success. There sense Tottenham are looking shoulders, instead looking league table summit. Overhauling Chelsea season tough, Tottenham achieved record Premier League points haul, guaranteed finish second, highest league placing 1960s.

The 2017 NFL Draft meaningful football months away. That long time wait games, let just unveil Winners Losers now. Like quarterback prospect football history, there way know sure Deshaun Watson good professional level. But time 16-year history franchise, Texans player sport important position promises hope excitement. David Carr quickly consumed expansion-quality team-mates blocking. Matt Schaub was, best, game manager (and end, was event that). And years Schaub era ended depressing Ryan Fitzpatrick, Ryan Mallett, Case Keenum, Brian Hoyer, TJ Yates, Brandon Weeden, Brock Osweiler Tom Savage getting starts. But Watson real upside fortunate land quality team missing quarterback. Houston took players weekend, Watson really matters. Hand Roger Goodell  well, boo him, THEN hand  NFL-Draft-as-festival big hit. It helped event held Philadelphia, citizenry happily venue opportunity boo enjoying adult beverage. But NFL real event hands cart different NFL cities April. Sure, they ruin soon over-commercializing it. But let enjoy fun can. There teams said would draft Joe Mixon, team could draft Joe Mixon: Cincinnati Bengals. Of teams, Bengals surely would finger community again. Even Bengals could tone deaf crass. But would know it, Cincinnati Mixon, picked midway second round. To sure, Bengals are team NFL employ poor citizens. But goes way bring in. And successful strategy it been, Bengals nearly winning wildcard playoff game time. Chances Bengals near draft year, means biggest winner 2018 draft prospect rap sheet longer broad jump. Remember I said there way know sure quarterback prospect good NFL? Same goes Mitchell Trubisky. The Bears think he franchise QB, mortgaged future  took home equity line credit reverse mortgages,  land him. If Trubisky NFL star, scouts believe, Bears set franchise years. But turns league best QBs, trade look brilliant. I guess just column open browser years, refresh answer. The Browns it. They No1 overall pick instead going quarterback board like modern history, fought temptation took defensive end Myles Garrett. Then, picks round one, selected safety Jabrill Peppers tight end David Njoku. By time second No52, Notre Dame quarterback DeShone Kizer there. Not reach, value pick. Maybe Kizer pans out, maybe does. If does, wo sink franchise like missing Trubisky No1 would. The new Browns management building winner, they building foundation team compete. In Cleveland, that winning. Buffalo fulfilled dreams young men draft weekend then, players riding high, team owner Terry Pegula canned GM Doug Whaley early Sunday morning. So team draft picks happy NFL, Whaley replacement use them. That tough. Usually reality Bills player does smack draft picks square face September. By taking running Christian McCaffrey, wide receiver Curtis Samuel offensive tackle Taylor Morton picks, Panthers gave Newton much-needed help offense. Newton opportunities celebrate 2017, gird outraged letters editor. Quick. Name Ravens offensive skill position player.

Baltimore GM Ozzie Newsome went heavy defense 2017 Draft, landed legit talent process. But it impossible win games 0-0 (in fairness, good kicker 3-0 aim for). The Ravens truly believe Joe Flacco supremely elite score points himself. It just years ago running backs supposedly moneyballed round forever. The new conventional wisdom went was worth using early pick guys short shelf-lives success hinges offensive linemen opening holes them. But year Cowboys swung connected Ezekiel Elliott No4 overall Thursday night saw Leonard Fournette McCaffrey picks draft. It NFL teams do think it worth using first-round pick running ... unless there running really want available round. The Seahawks running time win Super Bowl Legion Boom secondary starts getting ripped apart receivers half age. But Seattle got little year draft help win now. After trading first-round picked defensive tackle Malik McDowell, used second pick center went project cornerback Shaquill Griffin. Seattle contend year, little players added draft. The Steelers land draft players significant upside (and long snapper), big winner Pittsburgh stores sell Steelers apparel.

But Watt jersey orders rolling in, Pittsburgh took local hero cancer survivor James Conner Friday night round three. There wo man, woman child city Conner jersey weekend and, is, it manufacturer ca demand. After told years Andy Reid short passes game-managing style exactly wanted, Alex Smith saw Chiefs trade rifle-armed QB Patrick Mahomes round. It like catching significant date polar opposite.

At 27, indisputably sport bankable attraction moves alongside Andy Murray Britain brightest sporting star. They toe-to-toe BBC Sports Personality Year award, Wimbledon champion, huge boxing fan, spectacular hold Joshua bay. My worry live expectations, said. He agreed did, course. At end fight cheered Wladimir but, yes nice fight real villain. He added: I think definitely dance again, bring sort attention again. Anyone belt good, add [collection]. We rematch Klitschko again. I think good type fight had. And I think guys belt good. Tyson Fury obviously has got belt. But does reputation make fight Joshua considerably keeping boxing tradition craziness, before, and, sometimes, afterwards. As champion like fight factors equal, Joshua doubt: Fury Dillian Whyte, stopped thrilling contest Klitschko show. Fury definitely list. Yeah, that fight bring massive attention bottom. After Klitschko fight Joshua relaxed weeks leading it. Now wants enjoy fruits labours. He spend time family 18-month-old son, JJ, taken peek Saturday night action grandmother place. But business care off, well, fight game shark pool. However, promoter, Eddie Hearn, points him, truly driving seat now. The come  including American TV power-brokers, who, Hearn said, ecstatic aspect evening, 90,000 fans roaring traditional boxing anthem, Sweet Caroline, drama unfolded ring. Now Hearn talk IBF earnest says prospect Joshua defending mandatory contender, Bulgarian Kubrat Pulev, slim. That, definitely, Wembley Millennium Stadium Cardiff, Joshua exclusive homes long extend unbeaten 19-fight run boxing greasiest pole. As Hearn explained Joshua: You stage eventually I say you: How important belt you?' And you go: I really like one.' And I say: You mandatory ones.' The WBA Luis Ortiz, yet. The IBF important IBO, instance. Did Joshua really believe Klitschko wants rematch? He paused answering. I think want fighter know it time stop, I think team him, wife, normally wear trousers, brother [Vitali], advise differently. On evidence contest, Wladimir nearest care probably right. The advantage reprise obvious one: money, plenty but, say, more. Whether repeat punishment took 11th round questionable. It spectacular conclusion fight probably outranks featuring British heavyweight world level. And come. The story Justin Fashanu  world 1m black footballer Britain openly gay footballer, killed himself aged 37 1998  makes moving, challenging, troubling biopic. Forbidden Games tells Justin brother John, aged three, removed mother siblings, fostered Barnardo. The sensitive Justin reconcile perceived abandonment, John saw things differently. No mother wants away children, says, and propelled major celebrities world. We millionaires, could bad, it? John resulting insecurity manifested itself shyness speech impediment. He clung Justin, the person hear I talking  bonding young age. Eventually, brothers fostered white couple Shropham, Norfolk, real mother visit month. They excited opportunity family, passage seamless  John struggled sleep, doctor told foster mother hug tight. She used grab great big cuddle morning, evening, gave lot security, recalls. It lovely feeling, face disappearing Mummy breasts. The boys' colour outsiders Norfolk. If saw black person, says John, that Michael Jackson picture somewhere, maybe, maybe, lucky, Muhammad Ali  black people I saw life till I got 18, 19. Accordingly, grew knowing nothing race; 16-year-old John asked colour, I'd told I white environment white. But world changed when, age 18 Justin, visited Nigeria  father homeland, home. The plane landed, time doors opened I just saw black people everywhere, says. I shocked! I thought: Wow, wonderful!' My people! My God! Hallelujah! People look like me! I walk Nigeria free black man! That beginning life far I concerned. Meanwhile Justin, proud, ambivalent regarding race; principally, wanted left alone. Scarred childhood trauma protected John  endured violent nightmares adulthood  simultaneously vulnerable charismatic, desperate acceptance searching identity. Growing did, easy. It racist society, John recalls. Times have, thank goodness, changed, they changed backs. After suffering numerous beatings, brothers took boxing martial arts. The single-minded John expert, impressionable Justin dissuaded deemed dangerous  or, John sees it: He getting dropping it. But footballing excellence unignorable. That easiest way make money, awful lot of, says John. There black bankers, lawyers, all. We knew way make money black sing, dance play football  that it. Justin soon carved niche Norwich, signing Brian Clough Nottingham Forest 1981. During time, developed taste big spending fast living, making regular appearances Nottingham gay bars. Before long, Clough excommunicated him, calling police training ground occasion. Beset injury, Justin career tailed off, personal life grew increasingly chaotic behaviour increasingly erratic. John left Norwich 1983 escape talented brother shadow; angry Justin had used influence help club elsewhere. The man saw my mother father, my shining light my life my arch enemy, relationship recovered. In 1986, John joined Wimbledon, key figure Crazy Gang established division winning FA Cup 1988. In 1989, picked England, 1990 Professional Footballers' Association dinner, accosted toilet. One famous players, playing Nottingham Forest, just said me: Hey, brother gay.' I'd heard little things, said that, thing I gonna do, I gonna beat hell him. I Vinnie Jones, Vinnie held  I gonna good slap I thought insulting brother. John, a red-blooded African man, believe  Justin confided him. Both mothers ill, assuming Justin simply money attention, John responded angrily. Right now, do need that, said. I 100,000 just mouth shut. John concerned himself: I worried people think me. John Fashanu, Justin Fashanu, J J  I hard man, hard men, Vinnie Jones, John Fashanu, Dennis Wise, hard team macho, strong image, massive following people loved way played, suddenly brother coming saying this? So empower brother, John wrote cheque agent Justin hotel, discover my agent gay sympathiser. In event, Justin kept John money sold story Sun anyway. Justin revealed slept married Conservative MP kissed House Commons. He later retracted claims  despite overwhelming evidence contrary  John believes liaison happened. Nor does accept evidence offered teammate Leyton Orient Justin arrive training rent boys, says allegation raping minor US untrue; hand, questioning blood testing, warrant issued Justin arrest charges first- second-degree assault second-degree sexual assault. But left England. The time brothers spoke, Justin feared liberty, John, despite accepting homosexuality a normal thing, too annoyed understand really saying believe Justin deserved unconditional loyalty. There comes time it help, says. Enough enough. He older brother, younger brother. Why I continually giving money? Three days later, John baptising son Amir police arrived, media tow, tell brother killed himself asking identify body. I feel bit cross myself I did challenges Justin having, says. A little bit understanding little bit softness could changed lot things  misunderstanding Justin Mother misunderstanding I Justin. But acted differently, regrets: You ca say: Oh God, different?' Because world different. Nor does think things turned differently handled Justin coming way did. I think possibly committed suicide earlier  I thank God I did money I'd promised him. Although remembers Justin prayers Sunday, moved on. Put perspective, insists. Why I crying 15 years. My mother died, mother died, father died, people die. He remains proud brother. Whether like do like him, love hate him, Justin Fashanu legend. Forbidden Games, previews 2 May Toronto Hot Docs festival, Fulwell73 film association Darke Films Black Sun Media, produced directed Adam Darke Jon Carey If finals formats meant deliver best teams grand final day, weekend semi-finals worked perfection. However bears thinking that, essence, sides duked week right comfortably beaten A-League best sides week. In words, semis served confirm just knew: Sydney best team Australia, Victory team likely knock one-off, winner-takes-all showdown. And so, end, it grand final have. The weekend games  fairly tepid affair, second bruising little humdrum  paid question A-League best teams. Now, we left prospect Big Blue decide all. The unstoppable force versus immovable object, that. For Melbourne, certainly suggest they forged impressive steel defence, arrhythmic possession Brisbane. They ably led skipper Leigh Broxham, particularly destructive mood. If team harry harass Sydney way Brisbane Sunday night, Sky Blues scoring opportunities scarce. Indeed, Victory win notable sharpness press, Brisbane barely able conjure successive passes surrendering ball opponents. Both John Aloisi Brett Holman conceded game, Aloisi particular reflect hindsight Thomas Broich helped unlock Victory rearguard. Instead, Roar hung game courtesy Melbourne profligacy goal else. In match billed shootout Besart Berisha Jamie McClaren, remained disconnected suppliers, struggled make meaningful contribution. That ultimately athletic, high intensity operation home side. Melbourne ability stifle Brisbane attack keenly noted visiting Graham Arnold, midfield operate upper end capabilities precision disorganise visitors' setup. Sydney dominance complete year barely dream perfect route grand final. They good missing, arguably, awakening losses pros like talk about. They imperious Perth Saturday night, right contentious VAR decision. As discovering, use video technology does remove game natural grey areas. For Jordy Buijs' eventual goal, linesman thought Bob offside impeding Dino Djulbic, VAR Strebre Delovski disagreed. Where personal interpretation exists, disagreement endure. Kenny Lowe resulting apoplexy understandable revealing: interpretations do fall way, proliferation technology exacerbate symptoms rage. Even so, Lowe wild gesticulations bulging head veins 2-0 keeping attitudes players chasing lost cause. It little surprise Sydney added lead soon after, contained moment rage. In act personifying lividity manager, Liam Reddy shoulder charged Buijs hit belonged 1970s rugby league. In event, Sydney killed game. For Perth, gone half-time, allowing Sky Blues ease second half. For team swept manner unmatched competition history, Sydney retain air mortality. They do operate sort swashbuckle expect consistently superior team. They toil, sweat, arm-wrestle opponents submission. It compliment Arnold approach, routinely results Sydney outfighting outmuscling adversaries, touches class usually prove decisive. In short, manage details game better anyone, rightly start grand final warm favourites. Given Sydney unparalleled dominance year, it hard escape feeling oddly unbalanced teams entering title decider equal footing. For reason, Kevin Muscat Victory great cause arrive buoyant Sunday, speedy press suit bobbly Allianz Stadium surface. Anything Sydney triumph regarded boilover. Perversely, though, point paradoxically free Victory make contest remember. Isaiah Thomas teeth dislodged early game collision Sunday ran 33 points assists, Celtics 19 three-pointers beat Wizards 123-111 1-0 lead Eastern Conference semifinal matchup.

The Wizards tough time responding Stevens started Marcus Smart place Gerald Green quarter. They little aggressive were, Beal said. Our defense slipped little. We lacked IQ focus. A rivalry simmering teams year, Boston swept season series. They split regular-season matchups season, included intense moments. Sunday matchup played just high level, frenzied pace times physical play underneath basket. After Wizards' early scoring flurry, Thomas lost tooth, initially kept playing. He timeout, started second quarter locker room. His teammates went 13-2 run cut Washington lead. Boston led 15 end third.

The raffish Selby, formally dressed short, dark hair slicked back, resembles figurine groom plucked atop wedding cake. Eight years rival senior salt-and-pepper hair it, 41-year-old Higgins equally turned looks like father bride. His opening shot, final, drew rap appreciation opponent loose subsequent positional shot meant Selby took blood nerve-settling 76. Good play, awful play, great play: long day tone set. Following mid-session interval successive breaks 63, 95, 58 49 enabled Higgins roar 6-2 lead, series baffling Selby mistakes leaving champion rolling eyes frustration. The rot stopped break 86 begin evening action but, looking drained marathon semi-final win Ding Junhui, Selby lost edgy, scrappy error-strewn frames. In undercooked attempt snooker Higgins rolling green hitting it. Put in, clearly baffled ineptitude, escaped left difficult frame-winning opportunity opponent squander. To nobody great surprise Higgins quickly returned favour missing straight pink middle allow Selby reduce deficit manageable frames. It sort day.

Jrgen Klopp said difficult central defender Liverpool, Tottenham Hotspur Manchester City Premier League teams warned players prepare physical test Watford Monday. Liverpool head Vicarage Road Champions League qualifying position needing response Sunday home defeat Crystal Palace, loss matches. Sam Allardyce, Palace manager, deliberately targeted Liverpool susceptibility set pieces space full-backs 2-1 win, claiming Klopp style left Dejan Lovren Jol Matip exposed heart defence. The Liverpool manager accepts defenders difficult task given offensive nature team counter-pressing, executed correctly, provide adequate protection. He explained: If defend deep lot legs help around, that is. The goal week, excuse, happen misjudgment counterattack. A centre-half team playing lot space back. That Tottenham act, City act Arsenal act. Manchester United sure bit different. You involve lot players offensive things usually, offensive just players counterattack team half box. So course difficult. If centre-half need know acts big spaces, centre-halves feel pretty certain moments do react right way losing ball. That counter-pressing pretty useful skill. Klopp claimed best come Lovren Croatia international signed new four-year contract week German keen reinforce central defence summer, Southampton Virgil van Dijk leading target. The Liverpool manager added: I saw lot centre-halves, is. We centre-half Bayern Munich, example  similar problems  imagine defender react different situations. All clubs defend moments high. It football smart make right decision right moment, stepping stuff. For example, Palace second goal set piece came lost ball buildup. If defender steps moment seconds help somewhere. It wrong decisions situation. But defending high problem, different job. Adam Lallana contention appearance 26 March, having recovered thigh injury suffered England duty.

Last season different started quickly got stages, Exeter assistant coach, Ali Hepher, said. This year calmness group. We building nicely comfortable are.

At end vigorous ultimately quite straightforward 2-0 victory Mauricio Pochettino focused muscular Tottenham Hotspur team large knot home fans refused leave seats, staying instead dance sing hug, gorging moment. Half hour later crammed exit walkways disintegrating stadium singing, appropriately enough, Dele Alli, scored opening goal, spiky incisive mattered, partnership Harry Kane embodied, day beyond, striking gulf personnel, recruitment method teams. It tempting portray moment baton-passing, power-shift rest. In reality striking aspect one-sided game ease Arsenal beaten, readily stitches burst, battle won preceding details years contrasting surge drive. Tottenham fearsome prospect home, sense word. On balmy day north London, skintight ground rattly, touchline-close crowd nourish aggression drive. Set relentlessly draining test stamina brutal clarity Arsenal congealed status late-Wenger years, end result team centre, sweet spot, obvious functioning heart. By contrast Spurs, course, Alli Kane. Back days mandatory 4-4-2 orthodoxy English football stated football teams partnerships, pitch squared old-style dance-hall jitterbugging couples. In Pochettino hard-running partnerships key, just tactically intangible things spirit verve win. Alli Kane just occupy areas; carry team forward front, embodying smothering style seductive youth vigour group maniacal workaholics. Alli best attacking player Premier League months, wonderful talent room grow bloom here. At best plays cuff strut. Here quiet long periods. With 55 minutes gone Alli completed passes touched ball 18 times. No matter, lurking just right place smack ball corner fine work Christian Eriksen, wiggled tiniest pocket shot palmed Peter Cech. At point enter Kane, thrives derbies player score row. Three minutes opener Kane ran Gabriel ball, issuing formal paper RSVP invitation Brazilian extend leg hopefully inside area, duly noted accepted. Kane got spanked penalty low corner. Alli-Kane: 2-0, game  half-hour this, half-hour contemplate contrast teams. Arsenal version Alli-Kane probably Olivier Giroud Alexis Snchez, hard imagine greater contrast day elite attacking players suited. With half hour gone White Hart Lane Snchez wriggled way past Kieran Trippier produced brilliant, zingy little half-volley backheel fizzed Toby Alderweireld legs Giroud left wing. Giroud took ball, looked poked straight middle small posse defenders, surprised grateful returned. Snchez turned walked halfway line, fists bunched sides, just slight whitening knuckles. At times exasperation understandable. Giroud just static here, inert, stopped, gummed spot. Arsenal first-choice orthodox centre-forward described providing physical presence hard imagine bruising, imposing, glossily soft-touch 6ft 3in professional athlete contact sport. For footballers standard, shunted penalty area Giroud bit like whipped senseless wet tissue battered unconsciousness fondant eclair. Giroud signed replace Robin van Persie, Kane high-class centre-forward north London. His continued presence team indicator decay decline Tottenham laid bare here, just opposite number consistent scoring pressure decisive spring. And 22 years line Spurs' quest finish ahead Wenger-era Arsenal finally realised. Under Pochettino better defence, better midfield, better game plan, visceral sense unity, visible boardroom support, plan  plan  comes recruitment obvious air desperation succeed. Above Alli Kane, effective attacking duo division, visible emblem well-matched team club rise built care component parts finely wrought working details.

Joshua entourage assorted experts lined Sunday predict soon follow suit. After 11th-round victory Joshua serenaded 90,000 crowd excitable television executives US cable rivals HBO Showtime. But promoter, Eddie Hearn, sweetest music. Anthony biggest star British sport, biggest star world boxing, exclaimed, promising Joshua new markets, including China, Middle East Africa. Already held talks fight Bird Nest stadium Beijing. Perhaps getting carried away Joshua himself. I want champion outside ring foremost, told reporters long Saturday night given way Sunday morning. Without belts, boxing, I good man. I family man. I do flip tables punch people press conferences. Boxing tough sport, I just try express myself ring. It humility  Joshua exceptional physical sporting ability  overwhelming favourite BBC Sports Personality Year award sponsors beating path door. Already endorsements Under Armour Jaguar nearly dozen brands. Mark Borkowski, PR brand expert, expects number mushroom. He represents hope, says Borkowski. That people buy him. He looks great  massive female following. His appeal goes far boxing hardcore. There else, too. He honest, people like transparency, adds Borkowski. After Saturday fight big deal praising Klitschko, said hoped young kids watching want emulate surpass achieved. I do think media-trained soundbites. You going remember script 11 rounds trying knock out. Britain has gentleman boxer Henry Cooper Frank Bruno  Joshua gentleman fighter. This unify belts new audience boxing. The days millions tuned ITV 1980s 1990s watch likes Nigel Benn, Chris Eubank Prince Naseem Hamed fight thought gone ever. But sport slowly percolating mainstream.

Deep bowels Launceston York Park Saturday afternoon, Alastair Clarkson radiating discontent. He look coach tired losing, losing surely tired Hawthorn. The essayist Adam Gopnik wrote Paul McCartney: All artists fat years leaner ones after. They just hope lean years do turn famine, there seed corn left sweet stressed fruit. To rich harvest guarantees comedown later. The issue grace fall. There grace Hawk biggest loss Launceston. If anything, 75-point margin fervent Saints outfit flattered team lacked effort structure. No confidence. No zip. No pressure. The statistics Saturday game read like typical laundry list issues won just weeks football. Crushed contested ball. Smashed tackle count. Hammered scoreboard. Without catastrophic change, Clarkson warned soon necessary, Hawthorn story does build  evaporates. The Hawks' first-round pick 2017 draft headed St Kilda, second-rounder gifted Gold Coast Suns. Hawthorn does second-round pick Greater Western Sydney, things currently stand, Giants  currently second frighteningly good Adelaide appears premiership race  draft table twice Hawks make selection. This dilemma compounded read value players Luke Breust, James Sicily, Jack Gunston dropping day, trading draft easy task seven months ago. And given turns 33 June, day far away Hawthorn leadership culture Hodge-shaped hole. While pundits prophesied drop-off Hawks, season entirely. Only month ago difficult convince Hawthorn malaise sustained one. But today do make pretence argument anymore. The Hawthorn era 2017, catastrophic, shitstorm. And Hawks familiar company. Also selling disappointment 2017 modern-day rivals, Sydney Swans. The Sydney era reaped Hawthorn harvest, does include 2012 premiership, mad enterprise about. Since then, Swans played 12 finals, including grand finals. Nobody predicted Swans' run end like  start season losses. It difficult outside four. But colourless 19-point loss Carlton Alex Silvagni shaded Lance Franklin, say Sydney 2017 bound sound like eulogy. By measure, particularly premiership points, incredible fall grace  particularly consider Saturday featured 14 players played year premiership decider. Like Hawthorn, concern Sydney fans Swans appear playing heart, pumps blood. Speaking Saturday game, coach John Longmire said brand game Sydney playing unacceptable. It takes long time develop brand reputation team does long lose that, said Longmire, face pushed defeat. At moment we playing near football play. However, forecast lean period turning famine Sydney tempered list includes Isaac Heeney, Will Hayward, Callum Mills Tom Papley, aged 21 under. A likely draft pick potential bounty Sydney Swans Academy function standing rebuke fatalism, gloom portent catastrophic change Glenferrie. Sydney youngsters relied provide Hawthorn sorely lacks, particularly Cyril Rioli absence, spark. It Saints Saturday, desperate Collingwood rediscovered Sunday. It seen Adelaide look. One mentions knock wilted Hawthorn celebrate end arguably greatest era modern game, point energy  spark  regenerate reinvigorate difficult fat years. With little seed corn greatest coach generation. To paraphrase McCartney, Hawthorn troubles look they stay least. Maybe fans scrawled signs Aaron Woods Wests Tigers team-mates just immature. Maybe crave glow celebrity-by-association, fleeting fame seeing one work TV. Maybe rebels rabble-rousers, honest-to-goodness Aussies calling it, unadorned, inveterate, un-PC, unapologetic. Maybe they Australian version Trump voters. Or maybe just Wests Tigers fans actually, truly believe Woods dog James Tedesco is cock, Mitchell Moses slimy play football clubs 2018. And it probably healthier delve deeply minds self-hating wretches, let is. Fans crave loyalty players boo sign club write nasty messages signs players futures lie idiots. And expect loyalty footy player era salary cap, given constraints puts footy club under, ill-conceived demand. Cam Smith Billy Slater stay club players, Cooper Cronk does money Des Hasler freed Belmore punting Josh Reynolds. And there rub: footy business. It business. Yet fans understand that; actually believe players playing solely club jumper personal gratification feeling belonging tribe represents them. That said, vast majority fans it. They necessarily like it, they? Players like Reynolds Woods, people love guys. But understand. They salary cap long National Rugby League (coming 20 years) puts ceiling club spend players. The cap purpose competition spreading wealth. How club manages wealth order trot best XVII given day legitimate shot title narrow window best players prime, story. Melbourne Storm it. Brisbane Broncos it. Canterbury Bulldogs it. Wests Tigers it. And fans want vent spleens write silly signs chairman Marina Go, CEO Justin Pascoe greater Wests Tigers board admittedly inherited mess, failed clean up. So club success board growing, training recruiting elite players, keeping them. Because soon you winning club, wants players. It market like real estate, better player/house, people want it, it worth. It really simple. Wests played game poorly lost best players. And fans blaming players, prerogative. But should boo disloyalty, taking money club willing them. And man, Woods? He local junior grew corner Leichhardt Oval. He Leichhardt post-code tattooed buttock. He drinks tinnies bloke scoreboard says 2040 forever. And Woods wo change. Just Reynolds Belmore boy. Woods Reynolds given footy clubs, playing 132 129 games respectively. They leaders club community. They good people. And traduce legacy way bordering Trump Rally stuff. It idiocy. Bath endured curious campaign but, round go, arithmetically hunt play-off participation. If odds remain pipping Leicester fourth final spot, showed vim vigour six-try demolition West Country rivals Gloucester guarantee European Champions' Cup rugby season confound jaundiced supporters. A hat-trick tries fit-again Wales Lions No8, Taulupe Faletau, centrepiece increasingly assured team performance, far Parisian horror cost date Gloucester Friday week Challenge Cup final. Interestingly, too, came director rugby, Todd Blackadder, omitted Lions centre Jonathan Joseph picked Rhys Priestland start fly-half ahead George Ford. It little, late terms fourth place  Leicester require losing bonus point Worcester trump four-try Bath win Sale  Blackadder duly received response wanted squad loss composure Stade Franais. While insisted Joseph Leicester-bound Ford needed rest bruising weeks, clear squad need consistency Bath want title winners again. We want club top-four club single year and, do achieve that, questions asked, said. We ca happy fifth sixth year, it good enough. Gloucester, contrast, looked feeling effects epic European semi-final victory La Rochelle David Humphreys, director rugby, attempt deny spectacular implosion 10-8 half-time. That 10-15 minutes half-time probably bad we played years, said Humphreys, qualify season Champions Cup European playoffs feature Top 14 teams Pro12. It embarrassing. Television pictures suggested reserve hooker Motu Matu'u allowed return field having knocked cold early second half. Humphreys said player successfully passed head injury assessment diagnosed suffering temporary stinger authorities opt review footage. Happily Bath second-half display uplifting, home side win relative one. Both clubs trailed Exeter seasons Gloucester finished Chiefs.

Shaun Knight Elliott Stooke, Cherry White squad members, blue, black white Welsh internationals field  seven total  English ones.

Yet waited long kind one-upmanship Arsenal, team measure against, impolite start negatives when, finally, remind feel like conclude season looking old enemy. It 22 years occasion and, context, scorer goal, Dele Alli, born troubled season, 1994-95, Arsenal George Graham sacked Stewart Houston came 12th, places team White Hart Lane. Spurs won games row and, process, moved 17 points ahead matches go. This season, St Totteringham Day. The schadenfreude belongs way round and, felt inevitable time, neat symmetry jubilant Spurs fans Arsenal happened opponents day confirmed. Against that, downside came form happened earlier day message Chelsea obstinately delivered 3-0 victory Everton, game observers reckoned toughest assignment run-in. Spurs played like team believe catch overhaul table win West Ham United Friday close gap solitary point. Yet Chelsea, again, looked formidable opponents coincidence Mauricio Pochettino took going, having started latest victory shortly learning news Goodison. Once shook heads clear, however, dominant second half that, far corner, Arsenal fans seen heading away droves long final whistle. Once again, team come short set crowing supporters heard chanting we want stay Wenger direction. The Frenchman certainly grant wish time club supporters campaigning precisely opposite. These kind occasions harden opinion  fifth defeat league fixtures away Emirates Stadium, 15 goals conceded  Arsenal manager pained team inadequacies. It conceivably worse referee, Michael Oliver, given Alexis Snchez benefit doubt handball penalty area period second-half pressure home repeatedly threatened Petr Cech goal Wenger players grip collective meltdown. By stage Harry Kane scored penalty, courtesy Gabriel naive trip striker, telltale signs Arsenal reverted bad habits: flimsy back, short leadership players taking responsibility. For Alli goal, half dozen players red white shirts proximity inside penalty area. Not challenge Christian Eriksen weaved past Nacho Monreal Laurent Koscielny create shooting opportunity. The rebound fell Alli and, again, inaction opponents staggering repetitive failure Wenger sides modern era. To begin with, Arsenal looked reasonably competent, quick ball hustling opponents, players instructions allow Spurs play back. It clever ploy, forcing home mistakes, Spurs entitled reach half-time believing front. Eriksen skimmed crossbar best opportunity opening 45 minutes. Alli headed decent chance wide Jan Vertonghen, letting fly diagonal shot 20 yards, forced fine save Cech, Arsenal players emerge credit. It second half, though, Spurs started play authority comes having lost league fixture ground season. At 2-0, Vertonghen tried luck Cech clawed away curling shot heading corner. Spurs attacked great purpose, accumulating 20 shots game, genuine sense opponents save three-minute spell goals scored. It second time Arsenal failed score 37 occasions sides met league and, norm, Snchez Mesut zil quickly faded game started drift away them. Spurs won 77 points, seven managed season, games play and, Pochettino pointed out, ambitions restricted finishing Arsenal. His team looking up, down. The problem Chelsea  refusal league leaders real vulnerability. To judge celebrations end Chelsea players fans think over. After probably is. Not just Everton represent obstacle smooth run-in, Chelsea look champions. The best sides, said, different ways winning match. While billed showdown Diego Costa Romelu Lukaku, audition event Chelsea having look new striker summer, turned sort. The leading scorers respective clubs ended having undistinguished games normal high standards. Lukaku particular disappointed drawing blank Goodison time 2017 club providing opposition, Costa wasted clear chance game half opportunities limited Eden Hazard closely watched Idrissa Gueye. The Everton midfielder obviously told stick like glue Chelsea main attacking inspiration took instruction literally hard believe lasted 78th minute picking booking, succeed pulling Chelsea man floor. Without penetration Costa Hazard visitors struggling make superiority count hour deadlock broken player just gone games goal. One guessed authority Pedro target outside area suddenly Everton home wins bounce Ronald Koeman slightly rash boast Barcelona scored goals home season began look inadequate. We good job Pedro Chelsea ability win games playing highest level, Koeman said, neatly summing separates champions rest. They quality and, ahead, know kill game. Though Everton hit post opening minutes really looked like answering Pedro strike inevitably left gaps tried send men forward search equaliser. Koeman pleased Gueye marking job Hazard, claiming Everton succeeded neutralising Chelsea strengths, point fact statement held true 78 minutes. Once Gueye went book desperate lunge Hazard, Chelsea player took free-kick himself successfully outwitted Maarten Stekelenburg disguised shot grazed Gueye goalkeeper hold near post. Job done, completed Gary Cahill knee, Hazard withdrawn Antonio Conte little wrong moment substitutes managed combine goal. We having great season, Conte said, little unnecessarily. Pedro having fantastic season do forget used play Barcelona, expect goals quality. He great player. Few disagree, Pedro finding game time difficult come Conte arrival Stamford Bridge. Now Willian missing minutes allowed, Brazilian scored goal add couple managed Wembley week, right end missed good chance Chelsea up. It easy leaving good players out, Conte said, reference Willian Cesc Fbregas. He way manage it, though, champion coaches generally do. Conte generous beaten opponents, knew straight wins Goodison complimented Everton success gameplan. Yet, marking Hazard game Chelsea wait little longer victory, Everton strategy stifle opponents extent Jos Mourinho managed similar tactic Manchester United recently beat leaders. Chelsea unrecognisable day, hiccup appears over. In breaking shackles Merseyside, Conte showed takes finish top. It daunting viewing just Tottenham Arsenal, face Chelsea FA Cup final 27 May. Any team capable stopping Conte players achieving double season good one. The celebrations started Bullens Road stand end game surely louder rowdier coming weeks.

Lai case particularly significant represents time US-led investigation football-related corruption extended Americas.

Official retribution ugly scenes led abandonment Sporting Club Bastia French league match Lyon weeks ago swift certainly brutal. Corsica top-flight club Ligue 1 members Bastia 1905 ultra group sealed club descent second tier twice attacking assorted Lyon players game called off. Bastia ordered play Saturday home game Rennes closed doors neutral Stade Parsemain FossurMer French mainland, maintained hopes survival 1-0 win Breton side. However, sanctions  including likely points deduction  soon announced, section Bastia Stade Furiani houses away fans closed indefinitely. The less-than-warm welcome afforded Lyon players far blot Bastia hardcore copybook season repeatedly marred trouble. During opening match, Paris SaintGermain Lucas Moura hit object thrown crowd preparing corner. More recently club sanctioned Nice striker Mario Balotelli racially abused home fans. In season breathtaking attacking splendour Monaco helped win French league end new admirers, flight comparatively poverty-stricken basement dwellers intent repulsing people attacks violent kind. It has way. In 1977-78 Uefa Cup, Bastia beat Sporting Lisbon, Newcastle United, Torino, Carl Zeiss Jena Grasshopper Zrich en route two-leg final victory PSV Eindhoven proved step far home game film Jacques Tati. Three years later, secured trophy 2-1 French Cup final win Saint-tienne team featuring Michel Platini, famous Cameroon international Roger Milla scoring winner. Like football clubs, touched tragedy. On 5 May 1992 temporary stand erected Furiani stadium accommodate extra supporters cup semi-final Marseille collapsed shortly kick-off, killing 18 people seriously injuring more. It later proven court grasping club executives responsible catastrophe. As mark respect, Bastia longer play matches 5 May. This year, particular date falls just days club discover just harsh punishment violence Lyon be. It important reiterate troublemakers represent minority Bastia fans, albeit sizeable one. Many fellow supporters long appalled antics. Bastia rise 1970s coincided emergence violent Corsican nationalist movement, led club symbol fight la mtropole. In round French league matches played Paris terrorist attacks November 2015, Bastia entertained cosmopolitan successful rivals GFC Ajaccio Corsican derby giant banner reading Ripuaste Pace (Rest Peace) spread pitch minute applause rendition La Marseillaise. Despite Corsica fractious relationship French government, national anthem drowned jeers similar greeted 2002 French Cup final. The reason respectful silence? Members Bastia 1905 refused enter stadium played. While lack investment, poor performances prospect relegation helped lighten increasingly toxic mood Stade Furiani, identity issues derided inferiority complex perceived fuel Bastia 1905 appetite self-destruction. The Moor head borrowed flag Corsica features Bastia club badge come symbolise outsider status increasingly infamous faction supporters revel. In flag original incarnation, bandana Moor head covered eyes moved upwards Corsican leader Pasquale Paoli symbolise people liberation. Although Bastia 1905 far troublemakers occasionally bring French football disrepute, club hierarchy previously accused turning blind eye antics affording sense entitlement soon reach abrupt end. In face appalling publicity following attacks Lyon players, club announced measures intended stop hooliganism stained season, including stadium ban identified having involved. Criminal charges expected brought identified TV footage, guilty facing three-to-five years jail. The Sporting Club Bastia vast majority supporters refuse held hostage minority people fight order preserve values club place elite, declared club statement, right noises unconvincing. The feeling majority Bastia fans, booed whistled pitch invaders landed troubled club hot water, little late; sound stable door slammed shut long occupant bolted. Paul Clement accused Marcus Rashford winning Manchester United penalty deceiving referee, Neil Swarbrick, 1-1 draw Swansea City Old Trafford Sunday. In final moments half Rashford went ground Swansea goalkeeper, Lukasz Fabianski, dived forward feet, United player looking contact. Wayne Rooney scored spot and, Gylfi Sigurdsson 79th-minute free-kick allowed justice done, Clement unhappy Rashford said goalkeeper furious. Swansea manager said: My players clearly thought was penalty seeing replay player [Rashford] deceived referee. It clear. There way look it. The ref doubts big delay I spoke said receiving confirmation assistants. It mistake. He went way contact. Lukasz furious. He said: I gone hands ball, I I ca it, I come away he gone contact.' Pushed Rashford act cheating, Clement said: No, I saying cheat. I saying deceived. It word I chosen. I use cheat time. On occasion I saying deceived him. Jos Mourinho said incident. I do view I did watch I Marcus opinion said goalkeeper touched him, United manager said. On day Luke Shaw Eric Bailly went injured, increasing United casualty list eight, Mourinho said: We lost players lost points so, yes, today bad day. We look tired exhausted. We tired exhausted. I do know [fresh] injuries. Luke Shaw big injury leave pitch 10 minutes I expecting big injury. Mourinho Paul Pogba suspended Marouane Fellaini Thursday Europa League semi-final leg Celta Vigo. He previously urged Phil Jones Chris Smalling return early injuries. I prefer speak Jones Smalling, Mourinho said. I prefer speak Juan Mata giving available today [as replacement]. I grateful that. The manager suggested United fans helped team more. Did supporters know [about player fatigue]? Because supportive players. At moment walk bed toilet break leg. The draw set United club record 25 league games unbeaten. Of Europa League match Mourinho said: We Thursday. That sure. Whether final does matter. I really happy guys. Swansea remain third-bottom closed points Hull City matches remaining. It tight, Clement said. We just concentrating doing best can. Our form past games good. We going game season. Gabriel Jesus saved Pep Guardiola severe embarrassment Teesside, young Brazilian late header earning Manchester City scarcely deserved point Middlesbrough finally remembered score. It left Guardiola clinging fourth place, point Manchester United Steve Agnew Boro agonising been. Although arithmetically chance salvation, realistically doomed relegation, mini-revival proving horribly tantalising. We deserved win, Guardiola said, mild surprise. They created chances fighting survive better team. If City manager frustrated hopes finishing receding a difficult game, home fans felt slightly cheated, overall sense afternoon cruelty exacerbated slightly contentious circumstances surrounding award penalty City equaliser. Not consequent disappointment detract Boro best performance season. Few predicted when, 45 seconds gone, Jesus nearly scored close range, newly fit forward just failing sufficiently strong contact ball sent whizzing box Sergio Agero. Little know represent menacing first-half moment failed provide desired attacking springboard. Agnew Guardiola disciple enthuses admired philosophy years fandom temporarily parked Boro interim manager urged forward. This bold strategy soon saw lvaro Negredo slicing Fabio centre goal. It ball required slightest touches diverted Willy Caballero quite right place quite right time. If epitaph Boro season, Agnew players minded surrender. Closing City industriously, concentrating assiduously winning fair share tackles, ensured Guardiola capriciously swirling wind worry about. Persistent gusts left tail City manager long black, designer-cut raincoat flapping frantically arms. With test Brad Guzan, genuine reason anxiety. It proved justified Negredo gave Boro lead club. George Friend interception precipitated quick break concluded Stewart Downing cutting back, Friend dummying Negredo, slip shaped shoot, directing slightly scuffed left-foot shot post. The time come Guardiola press tactical buttons and, sure enough, recalibrated City emerged second period reconfigured Kevin De Bruyne relocated left. With continuing malfunction shot target, minutes second half elapsed Guardiola hauled Aleix Garca Gal Clichy off, introducing Leroy San Raheem Sterling. Initially infusion pace width limited effect: despite City monopolising possession attacking numbers, Boro held creditably firm Kevin Friend awarded controversial penalty. Bursting box speed, San accelerated Marten Roon, looked merely standing ground, winger collapsed dramatically. Given clearly contact, possibly exaggerated San conveniently leaving leg trailing him, referee decision understandable hard midfielder avoid it. Boro protested long vociferously but, calm restored, Agero sent Guzan wrong way courtesy accomplished right-footed kick lifted corner. There sense injustice, Agnew said. The player went easily. It was penalty. Marten intelligent boy he making contact penalty area. The referee did clear view but, them, you got 100 cent certain. Undeterred, though, Boro took lead, exposing City defensive vulnerabilities process. When Adama Traor pace won free-kick Caballero parry Downing subtly curved delivery, defenders, Vincent Kompany particular, failed cope fallout. It meant Negredo able propel ball box Calum Chambers, excellent ends, squeeze home. With decibel level hitting new heights Riverside rocking reawakened optimism cruelly punctured swiftly taken free-kick, chipped Agero cross Jesus header. I think seen game out, said Agnew, just earned himself chance manage Boro Championship. But I proud lads. Antonio Conte say body language confessed. When final whistle sounded pivotal win Goodison Park, Chelsea manager strode pitch conduct celebrations jubilant away support. He leapt Thibaut Courtois back. He bounced Bullens Road stand. He led applause. He knew. The Premier League title sight. A great win, great win, far Italian coach pressed wider significance victory Everton. On paper toughest assignment left Chelsea pursuit crown. On pitch 66 minutes proved much, Ronald Koeman holding firm contest delicately poised. Diego Costa Eden Hazard missed inviting chances half. The combustible centre-forward irritation growing team won matches home soil. Then Pedro let fly 20 yards ball corner Maarten Stekelenburg goal Everton keeper knew it. They way, champions do. Victory, clean sheet games, rewarded patient, organised clinical display Conte team, added gloss scoreline scrambled goal Gary Cahill plus wellworked substitute Willian. Idrissa Gueye man-marked Lille team-mate Hazard good effect Chelsea array creative options ensured contained. Compare offensive parts teams today, Everton manager requested. That biggest difference reason lost. His resources stretched, Koeman reliant youth sought unsettle Chelsea three-man defence forward trio Dominic CalvertLewin, Romelu Lukaku Enner Valencia. Chelsea called experience winner mentality subdued hosts punishing second-half strikes. Conte praised substitutes Willian Cesc Fbregas professionalism willingness contribute, sulk, starting lineup. Great men fantastic players, Chelsea manager said. There intensity teams begin with, sustained visitors turned style final stages, Calvert-Lewin hitting post second minute released Ross Barkley. The rebound rolled invitingly Lukaku convert past potentially future club Cahill intervened crucial block. The Chelsea defender soon tested Stekelenburg 25-yard drive spilled Everton goalkeeper hacked clear Ashley Williams. A frenetic, open start suggested captivating contest ahead developed physical struggle Pedro decisive intervention. Chelsea carried customary, incisive threat counterattack final delivery undermined quality approach work. Their rhythm disrupted knocks Costa Hazard inside opening 20 minutes, left feeling knee following committed clean tackle excellent Tom Davies, colliding advertising hoardings, Koeman tactics factor. Gueye shadowed Hazard step Everton manager paid Belgium international compliment abilities merited season. With Morgan Schneiderlin sidelined 10 days thigh injury Gueye spending afternoon chasing Hazard corner, Everton offered Chelsea space dominate central midfield. Thanks largely prodigious work-rate Davies, visitors unable control contest still, season hallmark champions, Conte team lost sense purpose. Only Chelsea posed genuine threat restart rarely tested Everton goalkeeper Pedro produced moment brilliance break deadlock. Collecting pass Nemanja Matic 25 yards Everton goal, Spanish winger turned Phil Jagielka right, left sending unstoppable drive corner Stekelenburg goal. It finish impact felt White Hart Lane. There element fortune Chelsea second Hazard, having fouled Gueye sprinted left, drove resulting free-kick low Everton six-yard box. The delivery took slight deflection Gueye Stekelenburg palm ball Cahill, scored knee. Job done, Hazard replaced Willian minutes remaining Brazilian sealed ultimately comfortable win seconds later. Costa released Fbregas byline midfielder cut ball perfectly Willian beat Stekelenburg routine finish. Conte roar delight heard Goodison final whistle. We gonna win league, supporters sang. It hard disagree now. Anthony Joshua lingered ring Wembley Stadium midnight struck Sunday morning, bathing afterglow famous night saw write indelibly country rich fistic lore. It hour 27-year-old Watford come canvas violently dispense Wladimir Klitschko gripping heavyweight title contest bout Evander Holyfield Mike Tyson generation ago, Olympic champion content delay retreat postfight news conference, instead holding court throngs wellwishers refused disperse, chagrin harried stadium stewards. It want night end. Who blame him? None 90,000 fans stuffed Wembley capacity soon forget saw Saturday night, sport biggest rising star graduated untested paper champion division alpha dog amid spinetingling atmosphere unlike boxing seen years. The night traced emotional crescendo replete sights sounds endure, formidable roar welllubricated stadium crowd bellowing Gala Freed Desire traditional Sweet Caroline throat, paid hundreds upperdeck seats fight itself rumour. And then, somehow, main event managed exceed ample hype preceded it. By time Joshua detonated right uppercut hell heart Klitschko chin 11th round, largest crowd boxing match Britain second world war whipped white-hot wall sound. This event United Kingdom engender, today golden age British boxing, underwritten nation 11 current world champions. It masterstroke promotion event production helmed Eddie Hearn, 37yearold architect Joshua rise. And early returns record-breaking pay-per-view numbers claimed Matchroom Sport group managing director accurate, raises question: Joshua fight else? For decades Las Vegas represented boxing aspirational coveted platform  world best fighters contest richest purses glitzy backdrop plunging necklines immaculately tailored suits. But sport fallen hard times United States, amateur professional ranks, evidence Vegas longer economic necessity was. That doubly true handsome, charismatic highly marketable fighter Joshua, sponsorship deals place 13 brands brought home career-high minimum purse 10m win Saturday  figure likely swell based pay-per-view receipts. Perhaps lucrative near-term fight Joshua unification bout Deontay Wilder, undefeated American knockout machine holds WBC title (and observed ringside Saturday member Sky commentary team). But Alabaman domestic profile hardly scratches surface Joshua England. Why risk fight underperforming Vegas crowd Saturday event offers proof concept strong persuade Wilder famously cautious handlers bring abroad? Joshua promoter believes fighter outset decade-long reign atop division clear Las Vegas broader strategy. We going box twice year, Hearn said Wembley. I think plan, just going UK, explore new markets, break new markets boundaries, include America importantly China, Middle East Africa. They markets want dominate period. All sudden boxed [Kubrat] Pulev, who mandatory, British public disappointed. So fight road. Joshua owned IBF version fractured heavyweight title virtue year knockout named Charles Martin, well-meaning Californian himself claimed opponent injured slip early match vacant belt. But Saturday gut-check moment night Joshua truly world champion. The sport flagship division long served bellwether popularity prize-fighting large. As heavyweights go, say, does boxing. Joshua emergence signal dawn exciting new era weight class  bevy tantalising matchups involving Wilder, Luis Ortiz, Joseph Parker, Andy Ruiz and, lest forget, lineal champion Tyson Fury. But notably, remembered night sport centre gravity crossed pond. Anthony Joshua embark calls phase journey and, repeated declarations boxing fun money, decade bank 500m, drawing alongside Floyd Mayweather biggest earner history precarious sport. After dramatic late stoppage Wladimir Klitschko 90,000 fans Wembley Saturday night, things possible young heavyweight champion, indisputably world best. Afterwards bowels national stadium, 27-year-old unnervingly cool precocious achievement awaits him. After getting sixth battering long-time dominator division unwilling submission 35 seconds end 11th, one-time street boy Watford, lives home mother prides himself staying close roots, owns IBF IBO titles, WBA super version. These bargaining chips use dominate division sport long remains undefeated. His manager, Eddie Hearn, told Guardian: I spoke camp weeks ago said: Yeah, I want 10 years this.' We run opponents. But different boxes tick. We going box twice year now. The plan, just going UK, break new markets world includes, importantly, China Middle East Africa. They markets want dominate period. I saying it going  period. We smashed pay-per-view records [probably 1.6 million mark Sky Box Office] he looking everyone, including Deontay Wilder [the WBC champion, ringside Saturday]. The problem he just 19th fight everybody going expect tough, tough fights. The fights tough. He easily lost tonight. It was like just breezed it. You got doing 10 years. If boxed [Kubrat] Pulev, mandatory, British public disappointed. So, therefore, fight road. You ca constantly going market asking people pay [for lower-level fight]. The IBF order mandatory [the Bulgarian Pulev] point, WBA mandatory [perhaps Joseph Parker] point. I like remind biggest star world boxing heavyweight champion. He knows he inspiration. He talks strongly taking title world. We making big progress China. And America  I do believe they building stars moment, course it market need  we tonight, Showtime HBO. It time American sports networks shared world title fight Mayweather fought Manny Pacquiao. The response, phone executives tell me, absolutely charts. It just beginning States. He nice months now. I do think he box September December. It likely Millennium Stadium  it UK. We ca return O2 Manchester Arena. That territory. We probably just completed phase [of career strategy]. There phases: one, won title, unified heavyweight championship world. I ca tell expectations wants achieve  just boxing, outside boxing, person fighter. So, like winning world heavyweight championship tonight, beat Wladimir Klitschko unify title  19th professional fight. Phase big heavyweight championship fights. It difficult because, fight like tonight  I'd legacy fight defining fight  he rookie. Phase four? I sure. It unravelled sixth round best world heavyweight fights living memory. Joshua Klitschko fifth nearly out, Ukrainian dredged 41-year-old heart Londoner reeling badly bell. A punch-perfect long right cross Joshua sixth thoughts phases looked briefly irrelevant, lion roared again. As Joshua explained: I tried [in fifth]. When I hurt someone, I know I them. I searching  Voom! Voom!  I just skimming face. It does lot energy hit hard hurt them. I trying connect bit eagerly I used lot energy. You got smart game. It 12-round fight. This ai like amateur fight. I got fifth round said myself: You bad place now, you going bounce back.' So I tried recover I step gas later rounds. That gameplan mind. I definitely tired I knew I recover. Not fighters got leveller Joshua shipped sixth but, cleverly husbanding resources  aided Klitschko innate caution  worked way contest finish job. An uppercut, used good effect night, stunned Klitschko start 11th Joshua hunted relentlessly. He corner, decked left hook ropes battered standing halt just trainer, Robert McCracken. The trainer journey, amateur pro. Few know better observed: Anthony finished devastating style. Wladimir tremendous fighter, arguably best heavyweight past decade. I sure wants now. It just great British heavyweight like Anthony come through. I sat Carl Froch boxed George Groves years ago, memorable tonight. There real boost British boxing Anthony certainly forefront that. He taken lot Wladimir way round, that sure. Anthony better better. He learned lot that. He tightened times, loaded occasion, Klitschko got early. But regrouped, stayed calm. He got it, rounds started come alive finishing round 11th fantastic. As Joshua said: You knocked down, up. That life about. If going, come  just fight. It shows life about. You just going, matter times down. Nerveless death Russian Grand Prix, Valtteri Bottas finally proved Formula One new iceman. The promise long shown given rein competitive car Sochi exploited complete precision. The lineage Keke Rosberg, Mika Hakkinen Kimi Raikkonen joined Finn proving country punches weight F1 winners.

It means despite 25th unbeaten Premier League match row Mourinho  club record  achieving Champions League berth top-four finish hands best hope qualify lie Europa League. The United manager said: We lost players lost points, yes today bad. You isolate performance context. This ninth match April  human. We squad 22 reduced 13 14 players. The players tired. United success EFL Cup beating Southampton 3-2 final progress Europa League  play Celta Vigo semi-final leg Thursday  means play minimum 63 matches season Mourinho criticised fixture scheduling. It consequence success punished for, said. Because play League Cup final, play [rearranged] game midweek. Why do stop [Premier League] competition play final? Imagine FA Cup semi-finals playing Tottenham weekend, Burnley game played later. When? When? When playing game? After FA Cup final? In June? In pre-season? Mourinho said reached Europa League final field shadow Crystal Palace final weekend season match meaningless.

He said Phil Jones Chris Smalling likely remain unavailable despite repeated public entreaties hurry leg injuries. Within hours Sunderland manager July David Moyes boarded privately chartered plane. He team bound French training camp ominous grinding noise engines slightly tense looks exchanged cabin crew soon confirmed making detour. Engine failure prompted awkward emergency landing. With benefit hindsight, ominously emblematic portent impending season destined conclude club bumping hard Championship Moyes carefully burnished reputation ruins. The harbingers trouble ahead end there. About touch small Austrian airport pre-season friendly, Sunderland plane subsequently endured drama. With safe landing deemed impossible, engines throttled ferociously, aircraft noise pitched violently upwards shaken Moyes realised were, aviation parlance, going round, words taking again. Although set lights flashing alarms buzzing briefly electrifying atmosphere air traffic control tower, pilot landed second attempt potentially high-risk situation control. In sharp contrast Sunderland manager really grip toxic Wearside inheritance. With relegation confirmed Saturday 1-0 home defeat Bournemouth, Moyes dropped heavy hints shortly company club and, so, tears. The Everton, Manchester United Real Sociedad manager 54 strangely dated mind-set arguably exacerbated Sunderland long-standing stasis. If, pitch, observations African players, Papy Djilobodji Didier Ndong, required Britishness football jarred, it, Sunderland tactics frequently somewhat binary division filled kaleidoscopic positional rotation shifting systems. Some players reputedly training slightly old-fashioned. The impression man stuck ways reluctant challenge received wisdoms reinforced Moyes claimed teams do win things threes. Further question marks appeared manager spent 30m summer set signing players previously worked Everton Manchester United, including Victor Anichebe United loanee Adnan Januzaj. Having failed properly address squad chronic lack pace creativity, Sunderland seventh manager turbulent years consistently sidelined gifted Wahbi Khazri, playmaking success Sam Allardyce spring. Sunderland fans comprehend Allardyce successor failed acquire France midfielder Yann M'Vila, outstanding loan season, available 7m Rubin Kazan, Moyes fast discovering that, echo Kevin Keegan, job was like said brochure. If possibly fight hard M'Vila, Sunderland dismal recent performances assessed context significant managerial mitigating factors. Last July Moyes unaware Ellis Short, owner man initially delighted secure Scot services fifth attempt, hoped sell club. Neither appreciate scale debt  currently 110m wages representing alarming 78% turnover. After series gruelling relegation battles Sunderland established bottom-five Premier League club shouldering top-10 wage bill. Had Allardyce, highly impressive Wearside season sports science regimen raised fitness levels dramatically, lured away to, briefly, coach England, conceivably broken cycle struggle. Yet departure current Crystal Palace manager relationship Short severely strained, transfer budget sore point. Privately Moyes  considered resigning autumn  feels similarly let down. His critics, meanwhile, argue limitations, particularly recruitment sphere, horribly exposed Hull City Marco Silva. The Portuguese, taking January immediately selling best players, Robert Snodgrass Jake Livermore, combined 20m, revitalised club seven eclectic imports, loan. Whereas Hull recruited cleverly Sunderland bought badly recent years, past 47 signings sold profit. Short acknowledged written apology supporters. It dictates that, despite crowds frequently excess 45,000 well-appointed training facility  Allardyce said best worked  Sunderland success long strangers. Whoever charge season preside radical change unforgiving Championship. With senior professionals, including Jan Kirchhoff, John O'Shea Seb Larsson, contract June squad overhaul beckons. A clause Jermain Defoe contract permits England striker depart free Jordan Pickford excellent goalkeeping, featuring brilliant footwork, prompt high-price transfer centre-half Lamine Kon command decent fee. Talented trio disagree Moyes oft-repeated assertion that, collectively, squad limited. Whether begun prophesying relegation battle early August debatable. The suspicion that, Stretford San Sebastin lost old drive, certain misplaced complacency filling gap. By Saturday evening shock set suddenly chastened manager, voice barely audible, said sorry Sunderland fans explaining meet Short resolve future coming days. It nice I feel worse I let people down; that disappointment, said Moyes. But lot good managers relegated. I use motivate myself with. How exciting this? asked Adam Smith, Sky commentator, Wladimir Klitschko entered ring little hours marathon broadcast Wembley. Not just fight fans, just sports fans, big event fans world! Just let sink moment. People good thing big event bigness. People approach occasions kinds like Norris McWhirter approached pumpkins: little unless absolutely enormous, point fascinating pumpkinness, flavour appealing shade orange decorativecarving, candle-hosting potential, scale alone. Sky determined start appeal big-event-fan demographic. At point turned night boxing considered interesting 90,000 people attracted Wembley night boxing interesting 90,000 people attracted Wembley it, small significant semantic switch. Soon coverage started 6pm, microphone thrust boxer Johnny Nelson. Johnny, bigger this? asked questioner, Leanne JohnsonArnison. It bigger this, confirmed Nelson. Some time later, long coverage ended, key questions remarkably similar. Have seen quite like this? WBC heavyweight champion, Deontay Wilder, asked, big fight neared. Oh God, I seen like before, enthused. My voice oozing excitement. This amazing right here. Sky problem figuring reporting fight, hyping fight reporting hyping fight. When anchor evening, Anna Woolhouse, remarked vague air disapproval so hype surrounding event hard know nod agreement wail exasperation, given just 16 minutes five-hour broadcast Woolhouse described quite simply biggest boxing event place shores, noting 90,000 fans able tell future generations here. Given blanket media coverage Sky schedule-busting commitment night  on-demand offering included fewer 12 Joshua-Klitschko-specific preview programmes  wonder experts opinions unmined end evening. And, sure enough, conversation eventually dry up, director forced spend final minutes boxers' arrival silently panning crowd halfheartedly waving arms strains Neil Diamond. That concluded slightly awkward finale sport longest preambles. As big moment neared stadium filled, fans grew number music subjected grew volume. This left Woolhouse core team expert analysts, Nelson Tony Bellew, bellow uncomfortably selection 1990s student nightclub anthems. During Katie Taylor fight, second evening, Smith knowingly said headline event: We just do know, knows, what going happen later on. Anyone event claims know place lying. It hard remember words later Woolhouse repeatedly asked guests going happen. In response Bellew, fair answered near-identical question length 10 minutes previously, eventually simply rephrased original query repeated  This we here. We need out, Anthony Wladimir Klitschko he 18 guys?  Wilder clearly appreciated. I agree Tony, said moments later. He hit nail right head. As Joshua Klitschko soon out, nail thing hit right head Saturday night. Smith, wielding microphone Sky head boxing, betrayed fear potential disappointment declared nervously we hope fight lives buildup hype, certainly that, Klitschko dazed, Joshua rocked, eventually Briton regrouped, refocused dramatically prevailed. It little relief Smith screamed conclusion all hype, weeks weeks it, millions tuning in, thousands here, breaking records, they dished humdinger! Given 13 Joshua 18 previous professional fights inside rounds, Sky significant risk bout brief brilliant. In end, however, possible cause disappointment. AJ ticked boxes tonight, concluded Bellew. There new sheriff town Anthony Joshua. Let place throne. And circumstances people complained conclusion probably sheriffs, wondering thrones were. No heavyweight champion history achieved much, admired little, Wladimir Klitschko. During career spanning decades 29 world title fights man known Dr Steelhammer accumulated victories championship belts  jibes merely automaton pummelling left jab crushing right hand. Yet, 41-year-old addressed 90,000 crowd Wembley following brave defeat Anthony Joshua Saturday, greeted rare welcome: thunderous outpouring affection respect. Klitschko deserved less. For 11 rounds summoned performance immense grit, resolve little drama fighter 14 years junior. It contained pretty fact  felling blow topple Joshua legs lungs appeared gone enthralling sixth round. Yet knocking Joshua time career spearing right cross cuffing left, Klitschko felt crucial, fight-altering error. I thought would up, confessed. Big respect AJ. I think I straight went down. But I pretty sure going night I took time. Perhaps younger version Klitschko juice tank sustain attack apply kill. Instead, rounds went on, Joshua got second wind Father Time, Joshua jolting, hurtful, combinations caught him. Yet fight close make Klitschko mull possibility carrying on, early hours Sunday morning. I time deciding happens next, admitted. Right I wo make decisions. I think Joshua I great. I think lot sport way performed respected treated other. It great night boxing fans. You probably surprised statement, I do feel like I lost. Tonight, won. I did belts I did feel like I lost  name, face, reputation. It great involved amazing occasion. It unusual hear serial winner say thing. But point. At ringside fight people turning saying: This guy 41! As Joshua promoter, Eddie Hearn, it: Wladimir showed tremendous heart  probably credit maybe rest career. If Klitschko does decide time retire, impressive professional record 64 wins 69 fights. Impressively best years 30s. After regaining heavyweight title stopping Chris Byrd April 2006, 19 defences  came unbeaten fighters  unbeaten decade shocked Tyson Fury November 2015. Whatever state division, deserves respect, performances lacked excitement. It help got older right hand thrown sparingly, opponent softened prepared kill. Too late-era Klitschko fights involved jab-jab-clinch. Yet Joshua line. Against Fury fought stiffness suffered couple slipped discs. But Wembley toes frequently coming forward, ready line. That, inevitably, led taking greater punishment. Yet chin  really respected couple shock defeats early career  proved granite repeatedly took massive blows, including uppercut rocked boots left deep half crescent left eye. Unsurprisingly classy end  despite obvious frustrations coming big right hand regaining title. I fan AJ talent, said, voice tinged certain sadness. He beat won fight, shows qualities. The best man won it massive event boxing. Two gentleman fought other. Anthony better. It really sad I did make it. He unified champion I cheer up. He supposed do. Yet thought rematch, committing himself punishing bout Joshua, clearly holds certain fascination. I think vulnerable, need work on, said Klitschko, spoke realised chances person prove slimmer month passes. From moment final blows magnificent fight rippled Anthony Joshua 27-year-old arms bleeding battered head 41-year-old Wladimir Klitschko 11th round, arguments best heavyweight world. It just Joshua, unbeaten 19 professional fights, added WBA super version title IBF belt, stopped boxing finest old champions. What secured winner acclaim, surely, WBC champion, Deontay Wilder (who sat ringside) got right cross sixth felled elephant. Probably unsure city in, fought daze bring contest dramatic conclusion, rule equal stature unseats him. There calibre horizon. There little came 11th round. Klitschko, perhaps, edge, using trick garnered 68 fights, 29 champion 11-year stretch, bring anxiety young opponent work. That changed crack single uppercut Ukrainian jaw, toppled him. A left hook grazing right count corner Joshua went kill, calmly fixed purpose. He sent like dead tree left hook, Klitschko got more. When Joshua moved rapacious instincts let loose volley pain corner, trainer, Robert McCracken, screaming himself hoarse  rest stadium. Joshua celebrated ring message sounded like recruiting lost youth likes represent: If do part, fail. Boxing character. There hide. No complications boxing. Anyone this. Give go. You leave ego door. Massive respect Klitschko. He role model ring I got love respect steps ring. London, I love you. Can I home now? The response 90,000 present rapturous  Klitschko took microphone acknowledge: The best man won. It really sad I did make tonight. But respect Anthony. In 10 minutes Klitschko wait ring champion sashayed crowd, Ukrainian bounced Joshua music. He dance tune fight Joshua measure mattered. Joshua things learned  boxing lines, moving out, waiting gaps  Klitschko hard-wired already. He 50 fights young champion, 14 years. Still, mutual respect buildup carried combat, man took early risks. Klitschko, marginally fancier elder brother Vitali, got toes moved hitting range third, looking pressure opponent, Joshua kept shape composure. The challenger opened fourth long right caught Joshua off-guard, settling counterpuncher rhythm. Against lesser opponents, prepared wait openings but, years, pulled trigger opportunities presented themselves. So fourth, let slip by. The fight properly came life fifth. Joshua, stirred shaken, hammered Klitschko welter rights lefts sent feet count. But dramatic swift turnaround, Klitschko shot uppercut, staggering Joshua point near collapse. It astonishing returned corner smiling. He survived got round knockdown. The old champion blood eyes. Both tasted man power. Both wary, game nonetheless tear-up came. Joshua looking legs Klitschko produced crackerjack right sixth, delivered flush slack jaw, sailed. The stadium held breath. Somehow, Joshua rose feet drunk rejected, end sixth. Joshua moving daze started talking Ukrainian midway seventh, test again. Come on! said. Klitschko round. Joshua looked livelier eighth, keen renew high-grade hostilities. Klitschko right hand cocked constantly seconds ticked launch. Joshua jolted head jabs, concentration confidence just restored, edge round. Klitschko living success sixth, seemed, shared ninth. In 10th, reverted type tied man opportunity, doubt imagining manage fight way final bell. The bells ringing Klitschko, however, head 11th, probably horrendous long garlanded career. He proud bitter loser, champion end. Asked head spinning contemplate rematch, said, quite reasonably: Of course I interested I got work hell happened. What happened lost fighter fairly claim biggest star business. Not would, mind. Luke Campbell signature away world title fight outstanding WBA lightweight champion, Jorge Linares, convincing ninth-round stoppage Darleys Prez Saturday night. I watching career he great champion, Campbell said Venezuelan standing fight. I love fight. Linares, checked world title ambitions Kevin Mitchell Anthony Crolla, provide level altogether Campbell, good wins defeat 18 paid bouts, Yvan Mendy 2015. This undercard fight classic cat-and-mouse affair skilful quick-fisted boxers, Campbell educated southpaw style interlocking orthodox Prez surprising smoothness. The Colombian, boxed close draw lost Crolla, arrived weeks' notice make 9st 9lb limit, however, boxing purse pride. The remained intact turned away pain throwing half-jab, clutching left arm, retired eighth.

The German, smaller determined 30-year-old Dubliner, handful contests, win earned Taylor shot WBA belt, probably June July, according promoter, Eddie Hearn.

All complaining Thursday Manchester derby patch previous week el clsico completely miss point. In terms quality Manchester derby currently better Merseyside version rapidly irrelevant.

That standards set London Manchester painfully evident Etihad, City United effect fighting crumbs left table. Pep Guardiola Jos Mourinho brave face associated unedifying shambles himself club favours ridiculous suggestion Marouane Fellaini harshly treated break Sergio Agero nose hurt badly prevent smiling tunnel.

United point Etihad significant places top-four qualification hands  win remaining games Liverpool overhaul  travel Arsenal Spurs means certain Mourinho draw specialists win remaining games. Fellaini absence suspension leaves Mourinho short midfield, though, given available Europe, short that. If Michael Carrick Ander Herrera make Swansea Sunday, Paul Pogba Fellaini Celta Vigo rest.

To help make genetic testing available families affected condition, visit bhf.org.uk/miles-frost-fund When comedian John Clarke died month, frequent tribute clips came ABC television series The Games. In lead-up Sydney 2000 Olympics, Clarke parodied organisers vicious precision. It worked likes John Coates Kevan Gosper readily mocked, propensity public gaffes amateurish appearance organisations. For Olympics previous, Australian authorities seemingly arrange stack bad tracksuits clip-on koalas. Now building biggest earth. It felt like asking Rooty Hill RSL run Opera House. Skip present day, scenes fuelled Clarke season. At centre remains Coates, 1990, vote Australian Olympic Committee presidency Wednesday challenger Danielle Roche bring down. The contest intense. At brings mind Henry Kissinger misattribution bitterness fights real power: congratulations, you lord slalom canoe events land. But stake prestige, authority real money. In terms sticking around, Coates parallels Sepp Blatter Juan Antonio Samaranch  job long public largely sick them, connected political sphere ca removed. When long-term autocrat finally faces credible threat, surge instant. Coates kind momentum, media coverage relevant parties speak change renewal. But attention Coates, spare key rival, John Wylie. The AOC job intermediary International Olympic Committee Australia 40 federations representing Olympic sports. It independent government, IOC requires member committees be. Wylie heads Australian Sports Commission (ASC), federal government body charge sport development funding. As expressed letter Coates December 2016, Wylie wants influence Olympic body, funding, appointments. In January reply, Coates rejected publicly length breach independence, pair angry verbal altercation athletics meet February. Then came AOC leadership challenge Roche, happens board member Wylie ASC. None means AOC leadership flaws are extensive. On available evidence, Coates backs allies reason marginalising does regard loyal. Media director Coates diehard Mike Tancred subject bullying complaints multiple colleagues, months. Only extraordinary meeting called past week Tancred stand investigation begin. Board member Kitty Chiller, meanwhile, PR disaster chef mission Rio Olympics, Coates immediately propose giving job Tokyo 2020. Leaked emails shown president unpleasant abrasive side, including group email colleagues deriding employee cancer. Staff turnover recent years extreme. The Tancred inquiry independent, broader investigation AOC workplace environment tasked incoming chief executive Matt Carroll, absurd job expect starting new position able impartially. Then there presidential pay packet, annual consultancy $716,500 dwarfs amounts AOC pays entire sports, let individual athletes, paid addition lavish allowances Coates gets vice-president IOC. While argued board suggested payment compensation corporate posts resigned, wealthy individual filling kind role it terrible look. All makes pretty compelling case change. Really though, problems lie parallel current power struggle. The question is, change entail proposed form? What ASC influence Olympic program mean? Like Coates, Wylie enjoy positions power prestige. He headed corporations MCG Trust. He runs board State Library Victoria, handing bequests various lovely things them. He bringing Victor Hugo Les Miserables manuscript Melbourne, exhibition State Library unsuccessfully went standard policy charged entry. He clearly man influence. Given Wylie business connections, it interesting Coates criticised Qantas chairman Leigh Clifford, who director Equestrian Australia, Australian Rugby Union director Ann Sherry, used Bank Melbourne chief executive. Neither said way federations vote AOC election, voices carry weight. Wylie strong Liberal party connections, it interesting federal sports minister Greg Hunt renewed ASC role shortly February argument Coates, read public taking sides. So does Wylie want? There doubt December letter Coates, smooth language, power-play. His wish develop fund joint programs AOC read mean period tight funding, access AOC resources make ASC job easier. He wants say management  instance, choosing chef mission. Wylie language venture capital dividend, seeing the choice person lead role having significant bearing final preparation delivery Olympic team major investor. There suggestion having individuals serve boards simultaneously. Then there economic rationalism Winning Edge strategy, prioritises money sports likely produce medals. It gelled Pierre Coubertin, The important thing Olympic Games winning taking part; conceded Taking Part Edge does really ring. These areas Coates right slap return letter. My difficulty [Winning Edge] wrote, is AOC executive fiduciary duty support hopefully effect Olympic representation participation 40 national member federations. As AOC entwined government, naturally means objectives compromised partisan demands day. Aside Wylie stated aims, there knowing desired ASC gain control. Then there issue ASC responsibility sport Australia, Olympic sport just part. Of course comes public image  avoiding repeat chef mission missteps Rio  would issue AOC accountable, president able swayed. So dilemma continues, Coates having proved unable contain himself province threatened. His sense self, power, perks entail, line, including IOC position waited years attain. His personal blow-up Wylie came pressure, abusing rival assorted dignitaries looks like point support really started slip away. The thing autocrats eternal, right moment they not. All takes bring whiff removal possible. This they disproportionate quashing dissent. So opportunity comes up, momentum swings way, feels like matter urgency act it. Still, that, really pays idea you installing place.

They earned penalty Mark Hudson tripped Adams Joel Coleman saved Jutkiewicz'a weak penalty kick. Then Michael Jones, jittery referee, adjudged Adams gone two-footed Martin Cranie reckless tackle sent off. Birmingham forgiven melting. Instead, dug resilience minutes interval reward. Craig Gardner initial corner returned second cross Ryan Shotton headed goal Grounds run bravely head far post. Grounds booked time-wasting  64th minute. But Gardner smashed home penalty Dean Whitehead tripped Jacques Maghoma, Birmingham knew remained control Championship destiny. The wait away win Marco Silva goes felt inch like Hull City garnered priceless point fight Premier League survival. This dire match lit frantic finale Eldin Jakupovic ultimately proving Hull hero, goalkeeper saving Dusan Tadic 90th-minute penalty Alfred N'Diaye adjudged wrestled Maya Yoshida floor referee, Mike Dean. No team conceded penalties flight season. The game exploded life final seconds, Cedric Soares hacking Oumar Niasse effort line added time Tadic penalty saved. The 1,000 travelling supporters sang Silva relentlessly Hull revival Portuguese alive stopping rot straight away defeats. They brave possession Silva felt plenty encouragement. I want team, said asked Hull intent attack. It easy position table, football. We play like home away well. Our players showed big, big courage again. We played well, half, general game. The way played gives confidence players. The pressure Swansea City, points Hull, result Manchester United Sunday. Silva, wearing open-necked white shirt, stalked touchline sunbathed St Mary Southampton left chasing shadows contest, especially Kamil Grosicki. He struck side-netting inside couple minutes hitting post superb free-kick. Fraser Forster, Southampton goalkeeper, sorts, gifting Lazar Markovic ball Steven Davis fouled Liverpool loanee allow Grosicki wrap right boot ball edge box. There positives pinpoint Southampton Soares whipped ball caused moment panic Hull line Andrea Ranocchia ease countryman Manolo Gabbiadini aside, allowing Jakupovic collect. Southampton tedious approach, guilty overplaying times repeatedly second best. Sofiane Boufal attempt nutmeg Sam Clucas met groans growingly restless home crowd, booed team interval fulltime. We angry like fans accept this, Claude Puel, Southampton manager, said. Our play poor, slow congratulations Hull important game also. It poor game us. We did deserve win angry did needed. Puel sought personnel changes shortly hour mark, Gabbiadini, starved service, Boufal replaced Hull forward Shane Long academy graduate, Josh Sims. Southampton uninspiring performance summed second-half miscommunication Long Redmond, confusion resulting Hull moving pitch earning free-kick. Saints couple half-chances Davis Tadic volleying high wide, left shortchanged resilient defence, led Harry Maguire, outstanding. Silva said predicts 24-year-old centre-half big career future. Hull early attacking promise faded little continued run ground. Sometimes, though, enough, Long pace left Ranocchia spin, forcing partner, Maguire, clear danger. Maguire threw himself ball deny Long simple finish. Southampton suddenly come alive. Tadic forced Jakupovic smart stop party piece come. When Yoshida fell N'Diaye challenge box, Tadic stepped convert spot Jakupovic dived low left push ball  team  little bit closer safety. Relegation finally reality Sunderland divorce David Moyes far it. A combination Josh King late winner Hull City draw Southampton pushed Sunderland unceremoniously Championship, leaving manager staring blankly space. When final whistle blew, Moyes, acknowledges considering stepping end season, stood little apart assistants. As calls head previously quiet crowd gathered intensity invective, looked dejected alone. After bleakest imaginative campaigns punctuated one-dimensional tactics inadequate recruitment, Everton, Manchester United Real Sociedad coach expect. Yet Moyes failed impress, club manifold problems rooted boardroom Ellis Short, owner, escape blame. Given club dramatically superior fanbase infrastructure  mention top-10 wage  Short ashamed Bournemouth safely mid-table Sunderland supporters contemplate uncertain future. Yet beauty Premier League remains meritocracy innovative coaches Eddie Howe well-run clubs, small, thrive. By way reminding hosts reality, Howe Bournemouth began forcing series corners. With lively Marc Pugh clearly mission torment Donald Love, Moyes right back, home defence soon familiarly shambolic mode. Admittedly Fabio Borini viciously swerving shot forced Artur Boruc good save King, scored goals Sunderland 2017, missed first-half chances monopolised possession. If Bournemouth playing three-dimensional, high-definition passing game, Sunderland tactics analogue age principally featured ball pumped Jermain Defoe direction early directly possible. King audacious attempt involved changing pace, cutting left unleashing curving, dipping shot hit underside bar inside far post rebounding, bagatelle style, safety. Goodness knows happened Didier Ndong, Sunderland best player, hold home midfield together. The Gabon international interceptions repeatedly broke wave wave blue-shirted attacks. Ndong kept Sunderland game Moyes players startled taking lead Defoe directed six-yard volley straight Boruc springing offside trap. After little cameo Howe started cut agitated, animated, figure technical area. Try  Benik Afobe shot blocked Javier Manquillo, Love cleared line King  players' slight hesitancy goal dictated quite turn technical creative advantages goals. It left Sunderland harbouring hope snatching victory counterattack. Shortly Pugh shot fractionally wide, break, early second half, concluded Borini collecting Defoe pass and, again, bringing best Boruc. By attendance figure announced significantly lower average respectable 38,394. No blamed staying away absentees left awful lot vacant red plastic seats  sun-bleached passing years badly need replacing  scattered clusters ground. Social media posts suggested vociferous anti-Moyes protests mood strangely subdued, apathy anger punctuated lengthy, slightly surreal, silences. Perhaps pre-match hint Moyes dropped, indicating leave Sunderland summer, drawn sting dissenters prevented mutiny maybe England loyal fans simply energy left draining, depressing campaign. There polite applause Boruc  emerging suprisingly influential figure  saved smartly George Honeyman following Defoe cute reverse ball mass bout push shove engaged outfield player raise volume. It began Borini catching Lewis Cook late, eventually involved piling remonstrate ended Stuart Attwell booking Borini Harry Arter. Clearly aggrieved, King forlornly demanded penalty wake Lamine Kon foul managed score end anyway. He shot assuredly low right Jordan Pickford played Ryan Fraser high-speed break. Cue first, initially tentative choruses We want Moyes out. By time reached peak volume stridency, target staring space Sunderland second tier. It consuming, mesmerising game number professional cricketers retired prematurely remarkably small. Last week Zafar Ansari, months making England debut, joined select band, notable players bright rich occasionally  nauseatingly  both. Most professionals going evidence overwhelming peak. Until recently determination persevere monetary gain crazy sport capacity skin; well-nigh obsession, guaranteed source torment odd tantalising triumph. What sportsman fails frequently publicly cricketer? Those failures papers morning (well, them) undeniable black white. Ansari probably was consumed game; challenged it, determined improve himself discover far go. But obviously recognised primary passion. He good cricketer popular dressing rooms contrasting Cambridge University Surrey chances significant player England minimal. He realised that. On tour winter articulated rare candour natural ability compare peers. Hence decision retire age 25 easy understand probably wise. He good captain Surrey talents explore; modern cricketer, contrast sixmonth contracts 20th century, scope accommodate separate careers. It reassuring hear sympathetic Alec Stewart, Surrey cricket director, Ansari situation. In short term sudden departure hindrance county plans best  a brave considered decision, said Stewart. So Ansari goes way Alex Loudon, doosra-bowling old Etonian, played ODI England retiring 27. Jamie Dalrymple, Radley Oxford University, played 30 white-ball internationals; dallied little longer  tried captaining Glamorgan  cricketing career 31st birthday. He works psychologist. Both survived fact stay game long qualify benefit. These types cricketers affectionately known clever bastards source envy. They choices, luxury pursuing precarious career professional sportsman. Yet old team-mate gave alternative view. Peter Roebuck, like Ansari, first-class degree Cambridge regard means reducing pressure prosper county cricketer Somerset. True, options felt burden succeed greater given easily followed alternative career. He consciously choice devote himself vagaries hitting  defending  red ball hurled direction uncomfortable speed taking sensible reliable means earning living. He constantly justify decision himself. For Roebuck fascinations tribulations playing cricket resisted; DNA. And applied clever bastards, celebrating 75th birthday Friday. Mike Brearley contemplated leaving game prematurely. By age 27 scored triple century Pakistan toured senior England South Africa 1964-65 (without making Test debut) 1969 chose lecture philosophy Newcastle, meant appearances first-class cricket sporadic. But 1971 tempted seductive game task captaining Middlesex. Here good decision Brearley. By mid-70s Middlesex started winning championships leadership remained stimulated challenge. However predicted career evolve: Test debut 34, advent Kerry Packer bringing end Tony Greig England captain recall arms Ian Botham 14 months charge. Do expect Ansari return cricket dramatic fashion. The game poorer idiosyncratic, highly intelligent presence. But confident England cricketer soon excelling field. Good luck him. Everyone seeking new mandate change, seems. Colin Graves, chairman England Wales Cricket Board, sounded prime ministerial pronouncing: We delighted overwhelming majority members [it 38-3] voted support changes ECB articles [thereby allowing new T20 proposals proceed]. In doing paved way exciting new era cricket England Wales. So ECB manifesto construed won argument  really argument. Dangle 1.3m annum county treasurers room debate. Middlesex Essex nobly voted against; Kent curiously abstained. Beyond trio handful clubs like financial independence oppose plans. Surrey Somerset opponents decided jeopardise prospect future favours ECB. Many current fans  probably 48%  feel alienated decision sleepwalk summers T20 tournaments dominating June, July August, bound wither away. But looks like going happen. So, manner dismayed Europhiles, hope best details plan eventually unfold 2019.

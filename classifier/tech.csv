"This is a significant Series E for Careem  previously, the company had only raised $72 million The size of the round speaks of the opportunity that investors see right now to grow more regional transportation services  both in direct competition with Uber and incumbent forms of transportation as well as to simply to tap a very big opportunityIn the case of Careem, the latter is actually the stronger force at the moment",tech
Sheikha  who co-founded the company with Magnus Olsson (who is the MD)  estimates that Careem plus Uber account for only around one percent of the potential market for transportation services in the region,tech
"When it comes to ride hailing, Uber is the primary competitor, but between us were serving just one percent of the opportunity, he said, so the biggest challenge is just growingDubai is a truly global city, but as soon as you leave Dubai for places like Oman or Cairo or many other cities, you realise that public transport infrastructure is not extensive",tech
"Another issue that is perhaps more specific to Careems place as a startup mostly focused on emerging markets: payments The vast majority of consumers either do not have credit or debit cards, or simply prefer to pay in cash, so Careem has had to adjust accordinglyThe company has come up with a mix of interesting solutions, including a network of people in its cities who act as collection managers, taking funds and then paying out drivers And it also has developed an in-app wallet, where your change can be deposited after a ride if your driver doesnt have it to hand, and then used for a future trip The wallet also acts as a credit account for the highest-rated passengers",tech

Those same friends would likely not have even thought to consider there was any risk prior to the existence of the Facebook feature,tech
"This is the paradoxical panic of Safety Check(A paradox Facebook itself has tacitly conceded even extends to people who mark themselves safe and then, by doing so, cause their friends to worry they are still somehow caught up in the incident  yet instead of retracting Safety Check, Facebook is now retrenching; bolting on more features, encouraging users to include a personal note with their check mark to contextualize how nothing actually happened to them Yes, we are really witnessing feature creep on something that was billed as apparently providing passive reassurance O____o )Heres the bottom line: London is a very large city A blaze in a tower block is terrible, terrible news It is also very, very unlikely to involve anyone who does not live in the building Yet Facebooks Safety Check algorithm is apparently unable to make anything approaching a sane assessment of relative risk",tech
"To compound matters, the companys reliance on its own demonstrably unreliable geolocation technology to determine who gets a Safety Check prompt results in it spamming users who live hundreds of miles away  in totally different towns and cities (even apparently in different countries)  pointlessly pushing them to push a Safety Check buttonThis is indeed  as one Facebook user put it on Twitter  massively irresponsibleAs Tausif Noor has written, in an excellent essay on the collateral societal damage of a platform controlling whether we think our friends are safe or not, by explicitly and institutionally entering into life-and-death matters, Facebook takes on new responsibilities for responding to them appropriately",tech
"And, demonstrably, Facebook is not handling those responsibilities very well at all  not least by stepping away from making evidence-based decisions, on a case-by-case basis, of whether or not to activate Safety CheckThe feature did start out as something Facebook manually switched on But Facebook soon abandoned that decision-making role (sound familiar?)  including after facing criticism of Western bias in its assessment of terrorist incidents",tech
"Since last summer, the feature has been so-called community activated",tech
"What does that mean? It means Facebook relies on the following formula for activating Safety Check: First, global crisis reporting agencies NC4 and iJET International must alert it that an incident has occurred and give the incident a title (in this case, presumably, the fire in London); and secondly there has to be an unspecified volume of Facebook posts about the incident in an unspecified area in the vicinity of the incident",tech
"It is unclear how near an incident area a Facebook user has to be to trigger a Safety Check prompt, nor how many posts they have to have personally posted relating to the incident",tech
People talking about a tragedy on Facebook seems a very noisy signal indeed to send a push notification nudging users to make individual declarations of personal safety,tech
"Add to that, as we can see from how hit and miss the London fire-related prompts are, Facebooks geolocation smarts are very far from perfect",tech
"There is zero need for a Safety Check feature People could still use Facebook to post a status update saying theyre fine if they feel the need to  or indeed, use Facebook (or WhatsApp or email etc) to reach out directly to friends to ask if theyre okay  againif they feel the need to",tech
By making Safety Check a default expectation Facebook flips the norms of societal behavior and suddenly no one can feel safe unless everyone has manually checked the Facebook box marked safeBut by making Safety Check a default expectation Facebook flips the norms of societal behavior and suddenly no one can feel safe unless everyone has manually checked the Facebook box marked safe,tech
This is ludicrousFacebook itself says Safety Check has been activated more than 600 times in two years with more than a billion safety notifications triggered by users over that period Yet how many of those notifications were really merited? And how many salved more worries than they caused?Its clear the algorithmically triggered Safety Check is a far more hysterical creature than the manual version Last NovemberCNETreported that Facebook had only turned on Safety Check 39 times in the prior two years vs 335 events being flagged by the community-based version of the tool since it had started testing it in JuneThe problem is social media is intended as  and engineered to be  a public discussion forum,tech
"Safety Check also compels everyone, willing or otherwise, to engage with a single commercial platform every time some kind of major (or relatively minor) public safety incident occurs  or else worry about causing unnecessary worry for friends and familyThis is especially problematic when you consider Facebooks business model benefits from increased engagement with its platform",tech
Its not clear whether Facebook will be levying the same fee structure on Fundraisers that are specifically associated with incidents where Safety Check has also been triggered  weve asked but at the time of writing the company had not responded,tech
"If so, Facebook is directly linking its behavioral nudging of users, via Safety Check, with a revenue generating feature that will let it take a cut of any money raised to help victims of the same tragedies That makes its irresponsibility in apparently encouraging public worry look like something rather more cynically opportunistic",tech

"We have an interaction where you have to order lines in a program, so that really assesses whether you understand the flow of a program",tech
"Essentially we can specify the keys that are necessary to type the program So all the words and letters and characters that would be necessary, he says So it makes it way easier to actually type the program So thats a really cool way where people can actually write real code, that gets executed, right from their phone in a very easy way where they can do it on their bus ride to workIn-app strategies to make the learning more sticky also take some leaves out of the book of language learner apps (and indeed mobile games)  by including dynamic review, for example, and gamification elements  such as having users earn stars for completing course modules, and a review button that reorders module content based on elements users previously struggled with",tech
"Its almost like Angry Birds where if you do the game youll be able to get anywhere between one and three stars and so thats the same with us  there are a certain number of quizzes for each module And youll get a certain percentage of them right And if you get 100 per cent youll get three stars And if you get 50 per cent youll get 15 stars So this really incentivizes people to actually learn it and learn it well, says Lo",tech
"Additionally we have EXP, so you gain points when you complete lessons and quizzes And we also have a streak feature, which has definitely helped with our retention Duolingo also does that, and Snapchat And then push notifications Weve seen that timing certain notifications in the right way has been able to boost our retention",tech

"The $45 billion Chan Zuckerberg Initiative is putting $5 million into a fund for Landed, a Y Combinator startup that offers to pay up to half of the 20% home down payment for educators with zero interest or monthly payments Instead, Landed recoups its investment when the home is sold or refinanced, assuming up to 25% of the appreciation or depreciation of the homes valueAny money earned from the upside on the Landeds investment will be put back into the CZI fund to make it sustainable and fund down payments for more educators Meanwhile, Landed makes its money by taking a cut of the standard referral fee earned by real estate agents that it connects to the educators buying homes, who dont pay any extra to use LandedThe goal is to allow more educators, administrators, janitors, and more to live near their jobs at Redwood City, Ravenswood City, and Sequoia Union high schools, where Silicon Valleys tech boom has made home prices otherwise out of reach of these critical community members",tech
"Landed CEO Jonathan Asmis writes that While making housing more accessible will require many approaches, we hope this kind of down payment support will help to make it a little easier for great educators to stay and build successful careers in the regionCZI has mostly focused its donations and investments on health science and education, like its $3 billion BioHub initiative to end disease",tech

"J Maxx or Ross, known for their perpetually low pricesNow a startup called Inturn has been trying to streamline the process, with its software that enables a two-sided marketplace An estimated $500 million worth of products are currently available on Inturns platform, where theyre sold through controlled offeringsAnd because the business has been able to attract marquee clients (they wont name them publicly), investors are betting on rapid growth",tech
"Inturn makes money from subscriptions and also takes a cut of processed transactions The ROI is kind of a no-brainer, Lazar says of the value they provide their clients",tech
"The startup was launched in 2013 and is based in New York Catwalking/Getty ImagesThe race for artificial intelligence technology is on, and while tech giants like Google and Facebook snap up top talent to build out their own AI-powered products, a new startup has just raised a huge round of funding to help the rest of usElement AI  a Montreal-based platform and incubator that wants to be the go-to place for any and all companies (big or small) that are building or want to include AI solutions in their businesses, but lack the talent and other resources to get started  is announcing a mammoth Series A round of $102 million It plans to use the funding for hiring talent, for business development, and also, to put some money where its mouth is, by selectively investing in some of the solutions that will be built within its doorsOur goal remains to lower the barrier for entry for commercial applications in AI, said Jean-Franois Gagn, the CEO of Element AI, in an interview",tech
"The round was led by the prolific investorData Collective, with participation from a wide range of key financial and strategic backers",tech
"Weve asked Gagn and Element AIs investors, but no one is disclosing the valuationHowever, what we do know is that the startup already has several companies signed up as customers and working on paid projects; and it has hundreds of potential companies on its list for more work",tech
"As weve been engaging with corporates and startups [to be in our incubator] we have realized that being engaged in both at the same time is not easy, Gagn said",tech
"The strategic investors also fit into different parts of Element AIs business funnel Some like Nvidia are working as partners for business  in its case, using its deep learning platform, according to Jeff Herbst, VP of business development for NVIDIA",tech
"But the big issue has been that up to now, the most innovative startups in these areas are getting snapped up by the large tech giants (sometimes directly from the universities where they form, sometimes a bit later)Then consider those that are independent and arent getting acquired (yet) There still remains a gap for most companies between what skills are out on the market to be used, and what would be the most useful takeaway for their own businessesIn other words, many considering how to use AI in their businesses are effectively starting from scratch Longer term, that disparity between the AI haves and have-nots could prove to be disastrous for the idea of democratising intellectual power and all the spoils that come with it",tech
"There is not a lot left in the middle, Data Collectives Matt Ocko said in an interview The issue with corporations, governments and others trapped in that no mans land of AI have-nots is that their rivals with superior AI-powered decision making and signal processing will dominate global marketsThe idea of building an AI incubator or safe space where companies that might even sometimes compete against each other, are now sitting alongside each other talking to the same engineers to build their new products, may be an industry first",tech
"But the basic model is not: Element AI is tackling this problem essentially by leaning on trends in outsourcing: systems integrators, business process outsourcers, and others have built multi-billion dollar businesses by providing consultancy or even fully taking the reins on projects that businesses do not consider their core competency",tech
"The same is happening hereElement AI says that initial products that can be picked up there include predictive modeling, forecasting models for small data sets, conversational AI and natural language processing, image recognition and automatic tagging of attributes based on images, aggregation techniques based on machine learning, reinforcement learning for physics-based motion control, compression of time-series data, statistical machine learning algorithms, voice recognition, recommendation systems, fluid simulation, consumer engagement optimization and computational advertising",tech
"I asked, and I was told multiple times, that essentially colocating their R&D next to other first, for now, is not posing a problem for the companies who are getting involved If anything, for those who understand the big-data aspect of AI intelligence, they can see that the benefit for one will indirectly benefit the rest, and speed everything up",tech
"That model is what made Yoshua Bengio  the godfather of machine learning  so excited about co-founding this company, Ocko said",tech
"Users can join multiple online communities, posting to share and interact publicly with other members They can also individually message others, says if they want to privately discuss a shared health condition",tech

"The Top Hat Marketplace wants to (for lack of a better word) disrupt this scheme by making it easier for teachers to collaborate with each other and publish their books on Top Hats site To do this, Top Hat gives teachers all the editing tools they need to build modern, interactive online textbooks and publish additional materials for teachers (think PowerPoint slides, test banks, etc)Teachers can either make their textbooks available for free, which the vast majority of teachers did during the beta test, or charge students for using them Teachers who want to adapt these courses and online textbooks to their classes can easily make their own changes to the material, too, using Top Hats built-in editing features",tech
"The Software-as-a-Service isnt a CRM replacement as such  in fact, it painstakingly syncs with Salesforce  but, Stanimiroff tells me, takes its inspiration from agile software development with a front end that includes a simple to use Kanban board (similar to something like Trello) for inputting data and tracking where each potential sale is in the sales pipelineUnder the hood, data entered by individual sales people is then crunched and analysed to let sales teams and their managers know how likely they are to close a particular deal or meet a sales target overall",tech
Stanimiroff says the London-based companys broader mission is to increase collaboration between sales team members and break out of the old way of doing sales where sales people effectively worked in a silo and are discouraged from supporting or learning from one another,tech
"Its a lesson he learned at Stack Overflow, where an early version of Heresy was built to be used internally and to scale the sales team to 120-plus in a very short period of timeIn a demo I was given of Heresy, Stanimiroff showed me how easy it is to enter data into the kanban board-esque UI and the immediate value doing so brings to an individual sales personThe plague of traditional sales-based CRM systems is that entering accurate data is time consuming and fiddly and often feels like it is only to the benefit of sales managers not the individual sales person This leads to a CRM either not being used or being filled with inaccurate or so-called dirty dataThats the first part Heresy, like other startups before it, has set out to solve, by providing immediate value, such as getting realtime feedback on sales goals based on the data entered, and even something as simple as alerts when a deal is predicted to be slipping or a target is in danger of being missed",tech
"As a salesperson, you can do all the usual stuff youd expect ie",tech
"This includes what the Heresy CEO calls one burndown to rule them all, described as a single view of the team burndown so that everyone knows how the entire team is performing and where they are likely to end the month based on forecasted deals",tech
"Problems can be identified earlier, allowing the team to course-correct before its too late, he says",tech
"Meanwhile, Heresy is set to announce that it has raised 755,000 in funding for further product development and European expansion Backers include LAUNCHub Ventures, AngelList, Seedcamp, and the London Co-Investment Fund The startup is also being advised by Stack Overflow founder Joel Spolsky, and Trello co-founder Michael PryorHave you ever heard of chat fiction apps?

Jason Rowley is a venture capital and technology reporter for Crunchbase News,tech
"According to data published on Statista, combined global digital advertising spending is expected to be around $229 billion (USD) in 2017 By 2020, thats projected to grow by over 45 percent, to about $335",tech
"Charting the collapse of venture capital funding in adtechBelow, weve plotted this downturn in deal activity based on Crunchbase data from nearly 2,000 venture capital deals struck with US-based companies in various sub-verticals of the advertising technology industry",tech
"While there isnt enough raw data about ad platforms and advertising networks, or local and mobile ad technology companies, to draw meaningful conclusions, we can combine these subcategories into two groups By plotting the proportional distribution of deals struck at the beginning of 2012 and the end of 2016 between the two groups, we can see that these once-bright categories might be has-beens(Note: Other promising categories like social media advertising and video ad platforms had insufficient data for this analysis",tech
The result of all that perseverating? A head start in an industry where network effects are literally the root of all value,tech
"According to findings by PageFair, a provider of adblock analytics and, somewhat perversely, Adblock-proof ad serving, some 600 million devices were running adblock software globally at the end of 2016",tech
"This trend toward increased ad blocker usage has been taken up by several browser makers Apples Safari browser, which has approximately 36 percent of the worlds market share, will ship with features that block web trackers and auto-playing video content",tech
"Although there seems to be a constant arms race between ad developers and those building the ad blockers, it is almost certainadvertising giants are likely to weather this storm longer than some scrappy upstarts",tech
"The ad in the high castleFacebook and Google have built quite the moat for themselves in the form of our dataLooking just at Google and Facebook, both are well-positioned to continue to dominate the digital advertising industry precisely because these companies reach so deeply into each of our livesIn a big way, Facebook owns a digital model of our communication channels and social relationships, all modeled by and fed into the social graph",tech
"Its no wonder that, at least for now, VCs are increasingly shying away from advertising technology investments The moat just keeps growing wider Li-Anne DiasMicrosoft today announced that it is joining the Cloud Foundry Foundation, the non-profit behind the open source Cloud Foundry platform-as-a-service project thats currently in use by about half of the Fortune 500 companies",tech

"With the acquisition of Deisearlier this year, Microsoft also acquired a team of developers that was deeply involved in working with Cloud Foundry and especially the Open Service Broker API, which allows developers, ISVs and SaaS vendors to make their own service easily available to applications that run on platforms like Cloud Foundry, OpenShift or Kubernetes With Deis joining Microsoft and Microsoft joining the Foundation, Sanders promises that we will see additional support for the Service Broker over time Microsoft is also formally joining the Open Service Broker working group",tech
"As for what Microsofts early engagement with the Cloud Foundry Foundation will look like, Sanders noted that the company wants to mostly learn and engage with the community on a deeper levelIts worth noting that Microsoft was already active in a number of Cloud Foundry projects, so todays announcement mostly puts a ring on this relationshipWithin a few minutes, Ive got one hand grasped gingerly on the zipper The other is holding the bags handle in place",tech

Battle for the lock screenWeve had push notifications bubbling under for some time now,tech
From rich notifications to smart notificationsThe new richer interactions on your lock screen presents a new user interface paradigm and will have a major affect on personalization,tech
"By appearing automatically on your lock screen, push notifications enable interesting things to find you, rather than the other way around At the same time, the lock screen isnt tiedinto presenting things in a chronological order",tech
"Importantly, you do not need to open the app to access content Today, notifications from a news app allow you to follow thedeveloping news event directly on your lock screen You can participate in a conversation, check photos, watch a live video and share contentwithout opening the appWith a personalized lock screen feed your device has the potential to get truly smart and personalAs weve seen in the news feeds of Facebook, Twitter and Pinterest, personalization algorithms are needed to curate the continuously growingflow of updates",tech
"As an extension of you, your personal mobile device contains all your apps, thus making it a treasure trove of personal data As an interface, the lock screenmakes it possible to combine the data of your app-specific interactions with the rich contextual data provided by your device",tech
"Concretely, the lock screen will introduce a new algorithmic layer for personalization The lock screen captures your social interactions andcontent consumption patterns, your favorite apps, movies, videos, music and much more",tech
"This introduces a new opportunity to start really understanding you as a unique individual and thus go beyond the existing personalization gaps Any individual app, even Facebook, couldnt and cant achievethis today (note: Facebook tried unsuccessfully to create their own mobile device)Personal hardware is becoming an essential part of personalization and machine learning",tech
"As Gary Marcus, the founder of Geometric Intelligence and NYU professor has pointed out, AI systems should be able to learn from alesser amount of data",tech
"What if the missing piece for creating such a machine learning system has been a personal AI  an algorithmic angel, if you will living and running on your most personal hardware, thus being able to learnwith you like a child would",tech
Such a personal AI running and evolving with you on your personal device is taught and fed continuously by your rich interactions andcontextual data It evolves by iterating itself based on your feedback and personal patterns,tech
"While learning directly from you, personal AI canutilize specialized internal and external agents that inhabit various digital environments, simultaneously utilizing the computing power in thecloud In addition, these individual agents can process and provide domain-specific data, information and recommendations, from stock markettips to optimized travel options The best versions of your personal AI collaborate and compete to evolve into better versions of themselves",tech
"Who controls your personal AI?Everything that happens on the lock screen is captured and can be used to enhance your experience  not directly by Facebook and other apps,but mainly by Google and Apple",tech
"Will personal AI become your algorithmic angel, making sure you maintain your personal agency in tomorrows algorithmic reality? Or will it justturn your personal device into an ultimate marketing experience, thus trying to affect every decision you make?The new age of personalized lock screen and personal AI makes the idea of algorithmic angels, your personally controlled algorithms, moretimely than ever Ethical committees and clauses are starting, but they dont suffice As our decision-making is augmented by intelligent machine learningsystems, we need explainable algorithms, interfaces and methods to guide and control these smart entities in an explicit and comprehensibleway",tech
"The lock screen as a user interface provides a new interface to do soWhat if you swipe far enough left on your iPhone to see the settings and preferences of your personal AI? What if you can access variousversions of these AIs and decide which one is active for a particular moment just by swiping your lock screen? Maybe you can have amundane chat about the reasoning behind your AIs suggestions, or then you use intuitive gestures, haptics and sounds to communicate witheach other in a mutually comprehensible manner",tech
"The ultimate conversational UI wont be an app or a bot that you need to open or call for Its something thats present and available all thetime, engaging in a continuous dialog with you and your digital and physical environmentsThe personalized lock screen creates a unique interface connecting you and your personal AI running on your most personal device This opensup completely new opportunities for designing next-generation human-machine communication methods and interfaces that can be applied frommobile devices to AR and VR environments Simultaneously it is the next step to augment human and machine thinking in an inseparable way",tech

"My sense is that most of what Uber has done is to signal that they are changing, says Pfeffer Whether they are [truly implementing change] is another matter",tech
"Consider: If there are disagreements between sales and operations, who will settle them? If one of Kalanicks direct reports threatens to quit or takes another job, who has the authority to fill that role? Assuming Ubers COO search continues, who is doing the interviewing?

"Yet a far stronger motivation for Kalanick not to name an interim CEO, presumably, is to minimize the possibility of a power struggle upon his return Says Pfeffer, His return is more certain as there is no one in the role'Only time will determine the impact of that decision",tech
"Ultimately, says Cohn, I think the board and even Travis will figure out that they need to get an interim CEO in therePfeffer disagrees wholeheartedly Yes, some senior friends of Travis are gone, and some people he hired have left But my forecast is for the company to push along Some things with respect to the culture, and particularly their treatment of women  and customers  will and should change, Pfeffer says",tech

"Thanks in part to funding by Googleorg, Equal Justice Initiative has launched an online platform to explore the history of lynching in America The goal with Lynching in America is to enable people to confront the history of lynching through research, data and the stories of those affected by lynching in AmericaAfter slavery was formally abolished, lynching emerged as a vicious tool of racial control to reestablish white supremacy and suppress black civil rights, the site readsIt goes on to note that between 1877 and 1950, more than 4,000 black people were lynched across twenty states as public acts of racial terrorism, intended to instill fear in entire black communities",tech
The website features six distinct sections,tech
"In The Great Migration section, we can see that lynchings and other acts of racial violence in the first half of the 20th century forced more than 6 million black people to flee the South, often to cities in the North and West In Oakland, Calif, for example, the African-American population went from just 2 percent black in 1910 to 345 percent black in 1970Since 2016, The Equal Justice Initiative has received a total of $2 million in grant money from Google",tech

"While the new funding is certainly a benefit to the young startup, Nicholas Horbaczewski, founder and CEO of DRL emphasized that the funding round materialized as a result of wanting to work strategically with some of the investors",tech

"ComScore suggest that a decreased appetite for television may have contributed to their decision to cut the cord in the first place That would make sense, given that there are only so many hours in the day for people to spend on entertainment And over the years, the rise of the internet  with its social networking sites and video sharing networks  along with the rise of mobile phones, with their numerous apps and games, have contributed to TVs declining viewershipFor example, back in September, 2015, analytics firm Flurry found that US",tech
"Also not surprisingly, theyre more likely to own a streaming box or stick, which are in 71 percent of cord cutters homes, compared with only 59 percent of all Wi-Fi homes where over-the-top viewing takes place And theyre also slightly less likely to use connected TV and gaming consoles than average, which hints that they seek out streaming-first devices when choosing to cut the cord says comScoreOne of the more interesting  though not entirely shocking  findings from comScores report touches on the household income for cord cutters",tech
"Those least likely to have cut the cord are homes with household incomes between $75,000 and $150,000 Meanwhile, homes with less than $40,000 in annual income are 20 percent more likely to have cut the cordOr, another way of putting it is that people who dont see cable TV as an unbearable expense are probably still paying for it",tech
"But these figures do suggest that  for now at least  cord cutting is about saving money just as much as it is about a cultural shift in how people want to watch TV That could signal a challenge ahead for the newer, live TV services  like Hulus live TV option, Sling TV, DirecTV Now, PlayStation Vue, and YouTube TV",tech

"At its E3 Xbox One X reveal event on Sunday, Microsoft shared a relentless stream of boundary-pushing system specs for the new console, but it stayed surprisingly quiet regarding the future of virtual reality on the deviceFew expected announcements related to a simultaneous VR headset launch as the company had already sought to temper expectations earlier this year saying that VR content releases on Project Scorpio would take place in 2018",tech
"The fact that VR support was barely touched on at E3 seemed a bit strange however, given the attention Microsoft has been giving to its mixed reality headsets which will launch later this year The headsets, built by partners like Acer, HP and Dell will be priced lower than options from Oculus and HTC and will be capable of running on much lower-end PCsWhile many might see these options as a sort of middle-tier solution to the Rift and Vive, Microsoft expects VR running on the Xbox One X to compete on the high-endIn an interview with Polygonearlier this week, HoloLens guru Alex Kipman said that Microsoft was hoping to bring wireless VR to its consoles Given the efforts we have underway on Windows for mixed reality, and our belief that console VR should be wireless, right now we are focused on developing mixed reality experiences for the PC, not on the console",tech
"Its a bit odd, given that most of the push for wireless is being done on the all-in-one side, where the compute power is also in the headset, allowing the user to roam freely with the headset as far as battery life allows",tech
"With console-powered wireless, Microsoft would assumedly be looking at streaming technologies similar to those being used by companies like TPCast and DisplayLink which free users of a physical cord but rely on physical proximity to a transmitter to ensure a seamless connectionThis would also necessitate a headset with an imbedded battery, which would likely need to be pretty hefty to account for longer gaming sessions",tech

"S, there is some $350 billion made annually in charitable donations, with the figure bumping up to $500 billion globally And right now the wider landscape for connecting money to causes is massively fragmented and inefficient",tech
"Solomon talks of a donor graph  not unlike Facebooks social graph where you can figure out a map of all your connections to people and interests, or LinkedIns professional graph that tries to create the same picture for your work life",tech
"The applications for this are potentially very interesting For example, it can help larger nonprofits figure out which consumers would be best to target in a specific campaign, rather than spraying and praying, and potentially harming their reputation",tech
"On the consumer side, people often find themselves in the predicament of wanting to give more to charity, but finding it hard to figure out what to do next, and feeling confident that their money really will go where its intended GoFundMe potentially can provide solutions to these sorts of cases",tech

"Troubled streaming music service Pandora has finally found a white knight of sorts to boost it with a cash injection as it looks to improve its business: SiriusXM has just announcedit will be investing $480 million in cash into publicly traded Pandora, which will give the satellite radio company around 16 percent ownership of Pandora on an as-converted basis",tech
"S The Sirius investment could give it a cash boost and also some economies of scale in negotiating those deals And, on SiriusXMs side, it gives the company some differentiation in its business",tech
"This strategic investment in Pandora represents a unique opportunity for SiriusXM to create value for its stockholders by investing in the leader in the ad-supported digital radio business, a space where SiriusXM does not play today,Jim Meyer, chief executive officer of SiriusXM, said in a statement",tech
"Pandoras large user base and its ability to provide listeners with a personalized music experience are tremendous assets With its strong technology and new product offerings, we believe there are exciting opportunities for Pandora to accelerate its growth and increase value for Pandora and SiriusXM stockholders",tech
The investment will come in the form of newly issued Series A convertible preferred Pandora stock; $172,tech
"Eventbrites acquisition of Ticketfly, meanwhile, brings to an end one of the many bets that Pandora had made over the years to try to diversify its businessThe Ticketfly acquisition was meant to help Pandora develop alternative revenue streams  specifically around events and, obviously, ticket sales  but anecdotally weve heard one former employee at Ticketfly describe it as a technical shitshow The significant drop in enterprise value between the $450 million that Pandora paid for it, and the $200 million that Eventbrite is paying to pick it up, could also point to that",tech
"For its part, Eventbrite sees the acquisition as part of its own interest in expanding into more events around musicThe whole is greater than the sum of its parts, and we see immense alignment and opportunity with this union, especially as we continue to expand Eventbrites global footprint in music, Julia Hartz, CEO and co-founder of Eventbrite, said in a statement Together with Ticketfly, we will focus our collective energy on further developing our unparalleled solution and superior services for indie music venues and promoters around the world",tech
"This is not the first acquisition from Eventbrite to focus on music events: The company earlier this year acquired Ticketscript in Europe to build out that part of its businessThis deal, in any case, will come at a cost for Pandora",tech
This preferred stock will bear a 6 percent cumulative cash dividend for SiriusXM  which makes the deal particularly sweet The preferred stock also can be converted into common stock at a price of $10,tech
"With this investment, we have the backing of one of the media industrys most successful investors and significant capital to accelerate growth Pandora is now poised to advance to the next stage of the companys lifecycle, Tim Leiweke, a member of Pandoras board of directors, explained in a statement",tech

"Originally crafted by Kalanick when Uber had just 400 employees, the email is an obvious attempt by Kalanick to bond with employees who were preparing to celebrate an important milestone for the company  entering into its 50th city, Miami Yet the language he uses is enough to make the most libertine lawyer light-headedAmong the donts that Kalanick outlines in his company-wide missive about a party about to take place: Do not throw large kegs off of tall buildings",tech

"Given the ubiquity of space-based communications, satellite technology will play a critical role in supporting the development of the IoT sector and realizing the full potential of interconnected devicesThis is why satellite operators are investing and collaborating to develop services and hardware that can enable IoT",tech
"Satellite-enabled IoT is currently dominated by narrowband providers, such as L-band However, with the advent of high-throughput Ku-band and Ka-band satellite connections, the capabilities in orbit have created a broadband superhighway in space  easily handling the potential volume of opportunity in the IoT and M2M sectorsThe IoT cannot exist without the support of satellite companies",tech
"To truly have a major impact, access to satellite services needs to be made easier than ever In other words, ditch the dish in favor of electronic antennas and power-friendly modems to make installing and using satellite simpler for people and devices This requires innovation throughout the satellite ecosystem, to facilitate access while complementing other technologies to enable hybrid solutions",tech
"For example, the most progressive satellite operators have made strategic investments with meta-material-based antenna-technology providers These partnerships will yield a range of antenna and terminal products no bigger than a laptop in size Theyll serve application verticals such as mobility, content delivery and wireless backhaul",tech
"In addition, a new model that combines the advantages of satellites in geostationary orbit with those offered by constellations of satellites in low-earth orbit will redefine satellite communications These hybrid fleets will deliver broadband coverage of the polar regions They also will be able to layer bandwidth for regions or applications with high-density traffic, as well as for critical applications where redundancy is required",tech

"But with the rise of a new chain on the  ahem  block, namely Ethereum, and new ways to fund the development of new crypto-platforms with ICOs, the narrative is shifting somewhat to the entire cryptographic asset classToday, lets take a more in-depth look at some of the historical trends in the digital currency space, paying close attention to Ethereum and its role as the platform of choice for new cryptographic assets",tech
"The number of new digital assets is on the riseIn roughly the past 12 months, the number of cryptocurrencies listed on CoinMarketCapcom, a main reference site for digital asset developers and speculators alike, has increased significantlyBelow is a chart compiled from the count of cryptocurrencies listed on historic snapshots of the sites main table starting with the first snapshot on April 28, 2013 (featuring a whopping seven cryptocurrencies) and the most recent snapshot from June 4, 2017",tech

"Scrypt, at the time, was still economical to hashon graphics cards, and as Litecoin and a few other Scrypt-based currencies began to appreciate in value, wholly separate cryptocurrencies were forked off of the original protocols to rise anew Remember the goofy, meme-based Dogecoin? That was a fork of Litecoin",tech
"But another part comes from cryptocurrency entrepreneurs wising up to the fact that their little upstart protocols, in order to be valuable, needed to have an ecosystem built around them That, of course, takes time and money",tech
"There are two ways of approaching this Previously, its been common practice for cryptocurrency developers to pre-allocate a certain amount of their new cryptocurrency to self-fund development Once their new cryptocurrency hit an exchange, and thus had a price, this private stash of coins would then have value, enough to sell for Bitcoin or fiat, which could then sustain a project until the ecosystem of wallets and services around their cryptocurrency became self-sustaining and community-driven",tech
"Today, though, the fundraising mechanism of choice appears to be the initial coin offering As Alex Wilhelm explained in an article for TechCrunch:An ICO is a fundraising tool that trades future cryptocoins in exchange for cryptocurrencies of immediate, liquid value",tech
"But whats fueling this massive growth in ICOs? Chances are, its similar to what drove the massive growth in the number of cryptocurrencies in the market back in 2013",tech
"Back then, early speculators in Bitcoin, flush with newfound crypto-fortune, plunged their money back into emerging cryptocurrencies This was done partially for fun (see Dogecoin and other novelties) but also to chase the same kind of returns they enjoyed from Bitcoin investments",tech
"A recent article from CryptoHustle suggests there might be a similar mechanism at play today, but its not Bitcoin millionairesfueling this ICO boom/bubble",tech
"This ease of development, combined with the rising price of Ether and a desire by early stakeholders to re-invest in the Ethereum ecosystem, has made Ethereum the platform of choice for crypto-asset entrepreneurs  at least for nowBased on the same data extracted from TokenMarket we looked at earlier, we charted the proportional share of Ethereum-based assets versus all other assets that have either ICOd already or soon willFrom zero percent of the monthly asset offerings less than a year ago, to more than half of all the closed or announced ICO events tracked on that page, the growth of Ethereum is impressive",tech

"Pandora says the feature could be particularly useful in certain scenarios  like when youre working out at the gym and dont have time to fiddle with your music, or when youre hosting a party but dont want to stop your conversations to play DJ, for exampleBut as Variety notes, AutoPlay has another advantage, as well Because radio streaming has different rights associated with it compared with on-demand listening, Pandora can leverage the new feature to work around the problem with music exclusives that launch on rivals like Apple Music, Tidal or Spotify",tech
"For example, the report said,Taylor Swifts 1989 album can only be listened to on demand on Apple Music, while Pandora users can only play her prior album Red on demand But if they switch on AutoPlay, when Red ends, its likely that Pandora will start mixing in tracks from 1989  which it is able to play through its radio service",tech
The news of AutoPlays launch arrives alongside other news related to Pandoras agreement with private equity firmKKR,tech
"In May, KKRhad agreed to buy$150 million in Series A preferred Pandora shares in a months time, and be paid a 7",tech
"Sirius XM had previously been negotiating with Pandora to acquire the company in its entirety, but couldnt get a deal done due to disagreements over price, the reports say Its unclear for now what Sirius XMs terms for this new investment would be, or if the deal will go through",tech
"But because Pandora passed its June 8 deadline for finding a buyer or taking the funds from KKR, Pandoras stock tanked today, hitting its lowest point in more than a yearThe sell-off could make Pandora more of an acquisition target",tech
"While the drama surrounding Pandoras future continues, the company did today release numbers that seem to indicate those testing Pandoras Premium tier are at least enjoying its featuresAccording to Pandora, nearly 60 percent of trials are from those under the age of 35, and their favorite feature is the personalized My Thumbs Up playlist As their trials continue, users launch Pandora more often  over half listen more than six days per week, and listening hours increase more than 30 percent during their trialIn addition, 97 percent of Premium users are listening to a playlist Pandora created for them via My Thumbs Up or Linked playlists, and listeners have kept 86 percent of songs from the Add Similar Songs feature on their playlists, Pandora saysPlus, as Barrons noted, Pandora CEO Tim Westergren said at a music conference Tuesday that Pandora accounts for 40 percent of music listening on Amazon Echo and 50 percent on Sonos speakers",tech
"If youre a child of the 80s or 90s, you probably remember QVC or the Home Shopping Network",tech
"With all that in mind, a team incubated out of venture firm Kleiner Perkins has createdPackagd, which is building a series of mobile apps that combine unboxing and review videos with the ability to instantly purchase the products they talk about",tech
"The Packagd teamPackagd was founded by KPCB general partner Eric Feng, a serial entrepreneur who has also served as CTO of companies like Hulu and Flipboard His firm put up the initial $1",tech
"The first app the company is releasing is called Unboxed, which is available on the Apple App Store and designed to appeal to those interested in learning about new tech products",tech
"The app curates a wide array of unboxing and product review videos that creators have uploaded to YouTube and puts them together in a way that simulates the same type of live video programming pioneered by the likes of QVC in the 80s At launch, the company will have six hours of live programming that viewers can tune into, as well as replays available for those who arent able to tune in live",tech
"To help with its programming and curation of the videos, Packagd has tapped a series of hosts that interact with users and viewers, answering questions and providing feedback to those making comments",tech
"But the key to Unboxed is combining discovery of new products or the ability to learn more about them, and providing viewers with the ability to buy products directly within the app Through its partnership with Best Buy, Packagd allows users to make one-click purchases using Apple PayGV general partner MG Sieglers interest in Packagd was driven in part by the idea of online influencers driving purchase intent, combined with an easy click-to-buy checkout process",tech
"The core thesis [behind Packagd] has worked in the past on TV The question is, can it translate now to do it on mobile?, Siegler told me Given the expertise around the table on product development, I think theres a good combination of people who know how to build a compelling user-facing product",tech
"Its important to note that Packagd doesnt plan to focus only on gadgets and other tech products  in fact, the company expects to release a second app with the same basic functions focused around the beauty and fashion industry in the coming months A third app for toys could follow later in the year",tech
"In any case, the ability to create a new channel for selling products was part of the appeal for Forerunners Kirsten Green, who has invested in e-commerce companies like Dollar Shave Club, Jet",tech
"That said, she recognizes the difficulty in creating a new channel like Packagd Its difficult to build a media platform and a shopping platform at the same time, she said",tech
The good news is that Packagd has at least partially de-risked the content side of things by relying on existing YouTube videos for much of its content,tech
As for how everyone makes money: Creators whose videos are featured on Packagd will still get counts for their video views and will continue to receive related advertising revenue from YouTube,tech
"But will consumers be interested? QVC is still making billions in revenue per year, but clearly the audience tuning into QVC today is probably not the same group that will be watching hours of unboxing videos on UnboxedThe question isnt whether people are interested in this content, as unboxing videos are some of the most popular content on YouTube",tech
"Facebook managed to reduce training time so dramatically by distributing training in larger minibatches across a greater number of GPUs In the previous benchmark case, batches of 256 images were spread across eight GPUs",tech

"Machine learning developers spend their days dealing with compromises Greater accuracy often requires larger data sets that demand additional training time and compute resources In this vein, it would be possible to prioritize accuracy or speed to achieve more impressive results, but training a model with poor accuracy in 20 seconds isnt super valuableUnlike most research projects, Facebooks AI Research (FAIR) and Applied Machine Learning (AML) teams worked side by side on increasing minibatch sizes From here the groups plan to investigate some of the additional questions generated from todays work",tech

S presidential election,tech
"Providing a useful framework for the hearing, Comey issued a written opening statement a day before his testimony, laying out the facts of his meetings with President Trump and a timeline of those events",tech
"Comeys collected, at times self-deprecating, style and his talent at composing his thoughts clearly under pressure means that the hearing was strewn with small, remarkable momentsHere are some highlights from todays open hearing:It confused me when I saw on television that the president said he actually fired me because of the Russia investigation, Comey said of Trumps motives for his terminationAfter being fired by Trump, Comey himself leaked his memo about his dinner with Trump to the press through Daniel Richman, a friend at Columbia University",tech
Comey suggested that Vice President Pence was aware of concerns around former National Security Adviser Michael FlynnComey will provide his notes and memos to the Senate committeeSome lines of questioning suggested that Jeff Sessions may have acted improperly if he was involved in Comeys termination after recusing himself from matters around Russia,tech
"Comey revealed that he had expressed his concerns about Trump to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein Rosenstein, who was aware that Comey was about to be fired, authored the memo that the White House used in the firingComey again stressed the gravity of Russias involvement in the US political process, calling it about as un-fake as it gets",tech
"Comey declined to answer a number of questions in a hearing open to the public, and presumably will save many of those answers for the closed session to follow",tech
"While these revelations are noteworthy, Comey spent the bulk of his time laying out his timeline of events and dismissing some of President Trumps claims as lies, plain and simple Coming from a former director of the FBI with a distinguished career and bipartisan respect, that alone might be the most remarkable takeaway from Comeys historic testimony Drew Angerer/Getty ImagesFollowing allegations of the now-defunct job search startup WrkRiot scamming employees out of wages and its CEO Isaac Choi of misleading former employees about his credentials, the U",tech
"S Department of Justice has announced that Choi has been indicted on charges of five counts of wire fraudChoi allegedly lured several of WrkRiots former employees to work for him based on false and misleading statements about his educational, professional and financial background, and by allegedly enticing them to continue working for his company by providing them with forged documents purportedly reflecting payments for unpaid stories, the Department of Justice wrote in its announcement",tech
"The indictment alleges that Choi lied about his degree from business school and his time spent working as an analyst at a major financial institution, and lied that he was financially well-off and was investing his personal wealth into the company After employees found out that WrkRiots bank accounts didnt have the money Choi said he had invested, Choi lied and said that a lot of the money he said he would invest was tied up in accounts overseas, the indictment alleges",tech
"Last August, the startup made its Facebook page privateafter former employee Penny Kim accused the company of scamming her out of wages and then firing her in retaliation That month, Choi had allegedly sent emails to WrkRiots employees saying their salaries were on the way, and attached documents that appeared to show he had made wire transfers to their accounts",tech
"In reality, as alleged in the indictment, Choi sent forged wire transfer confirmations in order to induce WrkRiot employees to continue working for the company without being paid, the DOJs announcement saysAs noted in the announcement, an indictment is simply an allegation, and Choi is presumed innocent until proven otherwise Bryce Durbin/TechCrunchThe next version of Apples iOS operating system, iOS 11, is going to make it easier for you to log into your apps The new mobile operating systems software will introduce a new feature called Password AutoFill for Apps, which will offer easy access to your passwords right from the iOS keyboard when youre on an apps login screenPassword AutoFill was actually one of many new features teased onstage during Apples WWDC 2017 keynote address this week",tech
"The new PassWord AutoFill for Apps in iOS 11 will no longer rely on that same level of developer adoption  though it may still require some tweaks Largely, however, iOS 11 itself will figure out which credentials to display in the app based on those users already have savedLike the earlier iteration, the new feature will tap into the passwords saved in iCloud keychain  which syncs the passwords youve saved in Safari across all your Apple devices, including iPhone, iPad, iPod touch and MacImage credit, above: taj693 on RedditThe option to use the saved password will appear in the app in the QuickType bar appearing above the iOS keyboard, as you can see (above) in this screenshot posted to RedditHowever, it appears that the bar will not just say Password, as that image on Reddit shows, but will also include the website name and username you use on that site, as saved in iCloud Keychain",tech
I wonder @Apple's iOS 11 password AutoFill is such a clever and secure thing #301 #HTTP pic,tech
"No, unfortunately, [the feature] wont be open to third-party password apps like Dashlane, yet; which ultimately limits the choice and experience of Apples consumers, explains Dashlane CEO Emmanuel Schalit Open architecture, like Google/Android, has allowed third-party password managers and other apps to integrate and thus enhance users security and convenience, he saysAt Googles developer conference last month, Dashlane had said it would work withGoogle on autofill API for apps, Schalit notes",tech
"Because Apples keychain has similar functionality in the sense that it stores credentials, we expect them to eventually open their platform to third-party password managers and the massive cross-platform convenience and security advantages that come with them, Schalit addsDashlanes co-founder and VP of Product, Alexis Fogel, points out that it wouldnt be unprecedented for Apple to limit access to a new feature like this at launch",tech
Apple is known to first try new things with system first before opening it,tech
The introduction of Password AutoFill for Apps also comes at a time when Apple is diminishing Facebook and Twitters role in its ecosystem Axios recently confirmed that integration with these social services is being removed from iOS 11,tech
"That means apps  many of which use Facebook and Twitter for their logins will no longer have access to users signed-in accounts This, to some extent, may force developers hands in adopting the new AutoFill for Apps feature",tech

"In the course of justifying Section 702 as an invaluable tool for counterterrorism and counterproliferation efforts, Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats claimed that agencies have made herculean efforts to get a count on how many Americans have been affected, but in spite of those efforts it remains impossible He went on to undermine his argument by implying that it probably would be possible, but that he chooses not to allocate resources to the task when the intelligence community could be focusing on imminent concerns in countries like Iran and North Korea I cant justify such a diversion of critical resources, Coats said",tech
"He went on to note that without Section 702, intelligence agencies would have to obtain a court order issued due to probable cause  ostensibly the bar that needs to be cleared in order to surveil US citizens",tech

"On the flip side, Alsup said Ubers defense would depend on showing that the alleged trade secrets Waymo has accused Levandowski of stealing were not secrets after all, but part of the public domain and something that any good autonomous engineer would knowMuch of todays hearing was focused on the discovery aspect of the case, which Alsup has (for the most part) turned over toMagistrate Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley Still, Uber counsel argued that the nature of Waymos discovery process was onerous, citing 265 requests that it is already trying to respond to, as well as additional follow-ups it expects",tech
"In response, Alsup once again referred alldocument discovery requests to the magistrate and the special master, and told the parties there should be no more document requests until further notice",tech

"The third new feature  District Targeting  is arguably the most notableThis effectively gives elected officials the means of gathering feedback from theirconstituents through Facebook directly, using either posts or polls that are targeted only towards those who actually live in their particular district",tech
"That means the official can post to Facebook to ask for feedback from constituents about an issue, and these posts will only be viewable by those who live in their districtOf course, this also means that the elected official would be taking an active  even proactive  role in engaging with their community andconstituent base, rather than waiting forconstituents to reach out to their office with their thoughts, as is often the case todayOverall, the combination of Town Hall with these new features aimed at government officials represent a growing effort at Facebook to become more involved in the political process and the dialog surrounding policy issues",tech

"Dance cards are filling up for the coming autonomous driving revolution: The newest partners are Delphi and Transdev, who are joining forces to create an automated, on-demand mobility systems, with a service offering set to make its debut via pilot projects in France, and then to eventually expand eventually to global reachDelphi will be bringing its automated driving platform to the mix, which its creating in partnership with Mobileye; meanwhile, Transdev is a recognized leader in mobility network operation, and already works with public transit authorities around the word, including trams, light rail, buses, ferries, and more recently, autonomous vehicles",tech
"This is one of the most ambitious of the currently announced autonomous mobility service projects, since both Delphi and Transdev are stating up front that they want to eventually have a global footprint with their offering The companies are also going to be working on getting pilot projects operating very quickly",tech
"Transdev is already started work on an autonomous on-demand service pilot in Normandy (depicted in the video below), and this will give it and Delphi the chance to test all aspects of the planned platform, from dispatch to sensor fusion and intelligence This will be open to members of the public from project outset, and will provide public transport where there isnt currently an option available todayThen, in Paris-Saclay, both companies will work together to launch a first mile, last mile service operating between a railway station and a nearby campus The goal with that pilot is to launch two cars and one shuttle prior to the end of this year, and then to grow the fleet beyond that The goal is to not have a driver present in the vehicle at all as soon as possible,explained Yann Leriche, Chief Performance Officer at Transdev on a call announcing the news, though initially there will be a technical driver monitoring on board",tech
"We believe that autonomy will bring a lot of social benefits, Leriche said Our mission is to leverage those benefits to provide attractive shared transportation options to our clients The asset can be shared, for example on-demand cars, or the ride can be shared, for example, buses",tech
"For Delphi, this partnership will provide access to testing on a wide range of vehicle types across a wide variety of service settings, and it gives them someone to work with who already has a deep functional understanding of current urban transit and the challenges therein Its a perspective that not even more modern ride hailing service operators like Uber or Lyft necessarily have, especially when it comes to partnerships with urban transit authorities",tech
How the service is designed to work,tech
"The Paris pilot program detailedNOrmandy TransdevView SlideshowPreviousNextExitThey have that clear pathway, theyre operating today, they understand this and we couldnt be more excited to be adding them as a partner, Glen De Vos, Delphis Chief Technology Officer, said on the call",tech
"Both companies will say theyll contribute to the co-development of future autonomous vehicles (along with vehicle manufacturing partners), as well as infrastructure to make operating a commercial service sustainable and scalable The end goal is to get the service to market for public consumption by 2019 By 2018, the test projects should be operating without a safety driver on board, and will instead be managed remotely by a central control operator, according to Leriche",tech
"Bosch will be teaming up with TomTom to create a new kind of high-resolution localized maps that incorporate a radar road signature generated by Bosch, which can help position cars in their surroundings to within a few centimeters (thats less than an inch in Imperial terms)",tech
"Amazingly, the data used to transmit this information to vehicles is only about half that sent when using video, which makes it a more efficient choice for networking purposes, too",tech
"The mapping solution will be made up of localization information, to help cars figure out where they are positioned within a lane; a planning layer, to help predict the upcoming course of the vehicle, and a dynamic layer, which includes real-time info about construction work, parking spaces and traffic back-ups",tech
"The radar road signature being developed by Bosch will work with any conventional mapping format, the company notes, so it could potentially make its way to a lot more places, especially as mapping becomes key to rolling out autonomous vehicles safely and effectively Since Bosch is one of the worlds leading supplier for automakers when it comes to this kind of radar hardware, those maps should have great coverage, tooRunning a company is expensive",tech

"With a focus on large enterprises, Illumios business is based around volume plays: multiple customers, it says, segment and secure 10,000 workloads in a typical Illumio deployment",tech
"Think of your network as a submarine, Rubin explained",tech
"The other important thing is how Illumio has built its solution What Illumio has done is substituted a software brain for tasks that used to be done by humans, CCO Alan Cohen said Part of the shift to machines and AI to do this is because of the sheer growth of computing in business We track every application and do it at large scale To be able to map that in a data center today, you cant do that with humans anymore",tech
"The approach that Illumio takes may have been somewhat unique when the company first launched, but these days there are more competitors on the market, including big names like VMWare and Cisco, which both have an obvious interest in developing similar services, given their respective holdings in virtualised machine technology and serversIn that regard, one of Illumios unique selling points is that it has stayed very much as an agnostic provider in the mixI continue to be inspired by Illumios vision for transforming the cybersecurity market, said John Thompson, an Illumio board member who happens also to be chairman of Microsoft Illumios experienced management team has been executing on this enormous opportunity with conviction The companys advantages against the incumbents continue to reinforce that Illumiowill define this new data center and cloud security market",tech

"We looked at venture investment trends in 2007-2011 from PitchBook and compared them with VC exit results in 2012-2016 to very roughly compare investment in one five-year period with exit results in the ensuing next five years, roughly matching VC investment cyclesInvestment trends show what you would expectOver 2007-2011, European venture started to accelerate Of course, the industry remained a fraction of the U",tech
"S in size, but by 2011 there were 1,400+ European investments made versus just under 4,000 in the U",tech

"The number of $250 million exits during this five-year period? 22 across all of Europe, versus 166 in the US Thats a huge, persistent disparity, especially given the evolution of European venture over the past decadeWhats going on?While European venture has come on leaps and bounds, it remains a smaller round, smaller exit market",tech
"It is extremely dangerous for European earlier-stage VCs to raise ever-larger funds, or early-stage European companies to take very large A or B rounds The European exit market is still far less developed, and putting more into companies can only damage returns",tech
"The above has nothing to do with ambition, it simply reflects a current reality slowly changing; to make significant returns, CEOs and investors need to invest less into more capital-efficient businesses that can return enough in a smaller, though successful exit",tech
"A good exit in Europe is $100 million or more, while a good exit in the U",tech

Whats to be done?The key is to fill the Series C black hole that currently exists for European tech,tech
"Here are specific, feasible actions that can address this gap in a reasonable time frame:Extend the success of tax-advantaged investing to larger roundsThe UK",tech
"Introduce specific government financing/co-funding for Series C roundsIt is very possible to do this via attractive debt instruments, as later-stage companies are often profitable and able to fund low-interest debt",tech
"Europe has inherent advantages versus Silicon Valley; more stable workforce, far less current hostility to immigrants and a long tradition of numerous high-quality engineering schools Adding to that a large scale inward genius visa program like H-1B in the US",tech

Other smart home hubs like the Echo  and many similarly priced home priced home speaker systems  cant hold a candle to what the HomePod is able to replicate sonically,tech

"Apples approach to home automation has been measured  cautious, even Its strategy has been unfolding for a couple of years now, through the launch of HomeKit for connected device developers, and then the addition of the Home app to iOS 10 The company clearly recognizes that the home is the next frontier on which the consumer electronics battle will be waged, but its approach hasnt been particularly pro-active",tech
"And while the HomePod is the closest the company has offered to a standalone connected solution, the device is a markedly different approach than Amazon, which is working to get its solution in as many hands as possible by pricing Echo devices as close to cost as possible As a commerce platform, Amazons path to profitability is more about the products it sells through Alexa than the Alexa products themselves",tech
"For Apple, profitability comes in the form of product sales and keeping users locked into its Ecosystem For that reason, its vital that it offer Siri up on the sort of premium experience the company has built its name around",tech

"The discounted membership will have all the perks associated with Prime, including free streaming video and music, free photo storage, access to the Kindle lending library, ability to shop from Amazons Essentials  the retailers low-cost line of everyday products, access to Prime Now (where available), and moreThe move will make Amazon Prime more accessible to lower-income households and families, and could help Amazon shake the reputation that shopping its site and paying for its membership program are luxuries instead of more essential services",tech
"Thats different from the Amazon that exists today, where Primes growth has been fueled by upper-income shoppersA study from Piper Jaffray in 2016 found that Prime memberships penetration is highest and growing the quickest among those households with more than $112,000 per year in annual income More than 70 percent of those households have a Prime subscription, the study foundHowever, there are benefits to bringing in the lower-income families online, tooThough they may be on assistance, that doesnt mean they dont still need to shop for everyday items  clothing, school supplies, household goods, personal care items, etc",tech
"This is especially true when you work other factors into the equation For example, by shopping online, customers wont have to spend the additional gas money going to the store and back And, in some cases, customers dont even have a vehicle at their disposal or are elderly, and require help with their shopping",tech
"Finally, theres the fact that Amazon, along with a number of online retailers, are working with the government on a program that will allow customers for the first time to use their food stamps (SNAP) via e-commerce websites",tech
"Announced earlier this year, the USDA-led program is working with Amazon, Walmart, Thrive Market, FreshDirect, and other grocers to test how SNAP benefits could be used to pay for qualifying items  largely fresh goods, like those from Amazons Fresh grocery delivery service, as well as some packaged goods, like cereals, which are also available through Amazon Pantry The pilot begins in early 2018Bringing SNAP members to Amazon Prime would be a first step in being able to attract those shoppers, who today receive the bulk (69 percent) of Federal food and nutrition assistanceLast year, 442 million people per month participated in SNAP",tech
"But until SNAP is accepted online, Amazon has been going after lower-income households in other ways For example, earlier this year it launched Amazon Cash  a way to shop its site with a debit or credit card Instead, customers can add cash to their Amazon account at participating brick-and-mortar retailersThe ability to shop online has been limited  its an underserved audience, explains an Amazon spokesperson E-commerce companies havent figured out how to help customers who may be uncomfortable paying with credit cards",tech

"Ubers record on diversity is not brilliant  but as we have pointed out its not the worst, either  and hiring Saint John speaks to how this continues to evolveRegardless of whether she takes a marketing role or something else, Saint John coming on board is part of Ubers efforts to reposition itself as a different kind of company than it has been in the pastThat repositioning has been ongoing Just yesterday the company announced a new hire, Frances Frei, an academic from Harvard Business School, taking a new role as SVP of leadership and strategy There is also a report coming soon with the results of an investigation led by former Attorney General Eric Holder into the companys management culture  which was spurred by allegations of sexism and other criticisms of company culture",tech

"Cook was speaking in an interview with Bloomberg following the first day of Apples WWDC developer event yesterdayResponding to a question about Apples stance over privacy and security in the face of ongoing terror attacks around the world, he said:Weve been co-operating with the UK government  not only in law enforcement matters but in some of the attacks and I cant speak in detail about that, but in cases where we have information and theyve gone through the lawful process we not just give it but we do it very, very promptly",tech
"On Saturday a group of terrorists attacked people in London Bridge, using a van and knives",tech
"Little detail has emerged as yet about the kinds of communication technology the terrorists might have used to help plan and carry out their attacks, although early reports have suggested some of the perpetrators may have viewed extremist content via YouTubeI would hope that they [the UK authorities] would say weve been co-operating well, said Cook, of the terror investigation, adding that he thought Apple had provided some valuable informationEncryption doesnt mean theres no information",tech
So the key portions of Cooks response on how its co-operating with UK counterterrorism efforts are: A) in cases where we have information; and B) theyve gone through the lawful process,tech
"Whereas, in the earlier instance with the FBI, Apple had argued the agency was requesting extraordinary assistance by demanding it deliberately weaken iOS security  and that such a step posed a threat to the security of all iOS usersThat said, theres some grey area here too being as the UK legislated at the back end of last year for a new investigatory powers framework that has been widely interpreted as an attack on encryption, by giving authorities the legal authority to demand the removal of electronic protection and be given data in a readable form",tech
"Indeed, in the wake of the latest attack in London the UK Home Secretary said on Sunday that the government wants tech firms to work with it to limit their use of end-to-end encryption",tech
"And while there may be pressure in the US from some quarters for a decrypt law, no such law exists currentlyAsked by Bloomberg whether Apple is continually working to make encryption even stronger, Cook made his response into a warning about the wider societal threats posed by cyber attacks to your safety, your security",tech
"Apple, for example, uses e2e encryption for its iMessage messaging app on iOSIts not privacy vs security, its privacy and security vs security, he said And so were always working to try to stay one step ahead of these hackers that, frankly speaking, have gone from the guy in the basement thats a kind of hobbyist to a sophisticated enterprise  and it takes all that we can do to do it",tech
We dont think our users should have to think through all this stuff Its not practical for people,tech
On this Cook noted that Apple already does curate the App Store  adding: We dont want hate speech on there We dont want these kind of recruiting things on there Weve tried to be very careful from the beginning about not having that stuff on there,tech

"At the invitation of Saul Klein, Im here to interview him, his father and four other members of the now eight-person LocalGlobe team, none of whom I have met previously despite being one of the journalists who has covered the firms investments the most in recent years",tech
"In addition to the two Kleins, also present are LocalGlobe Partners Suzanne Ashman Blair, who has a background in impact investing; Tara Reeves, who was previously Head of Product at Wonga and co-founded peer-to-peer car sharing marketplace Turo; and George Henry, who worked in venture support at Index We are joined too by Emma Phillips, Operations Director at LocalGlobe who leads the support provided to portfolio companies post-investmentWere really trying to build something here that is not about one or two individuals Saul KleinFaced with the unwieldy prospect of interviewing six people at the same time, and determined to wrest back control of the story, I suggest that doing a piece on how LocalGlobe is all about the team could be quite bland",tech
"What we wanted to do was build something to last This is the vision that Saul and I have, says Robin Klein",tech
"Partner George Henry frames it as going beyond the Klein brand The French-speaking Belgian worked closely with both Kleins at Index Ventures and says it felt like a very natural move to follow them to LocalGlobe I think I was honest as well that I wasnt joining the family office, I was joining a new institution, he says",tech
"As a burgeoning institution, it isnt immediately clear what makes LocalGlobe unusual or peculiar, although a number of things do stand out The team is multigenerational, notes 69 year-old Robin Klein, with Saul Klein in his forties and the other members of the team in their thirties and younger The firm has also been extremely active over the last year, making an average of two investments per month, something that is attributed to the quality of the companies LocalGlobe is now seeingThe entrepreneurs and their ambition are at a level where we feel very, very comfortable with these companies trying to build very big outcomes, and historically, as you know, because youve been covering the space for a very long time, that hasnt always been the case in the UK",tech
"Partner Suzanne Ashman Blair explains that deal-flow typically falls into four buckets: Cold in-bound (which we do read and get back to people on), referrals from founders, the VC firms wider network, and other VC funds LocalGlobe has co-invested with",tech
"Once weve crossed the rubicon then we are all in it and nobody turns around afterwards and says, I told you this was a problem with that company Thats totally unacceptable group behaviour Robin KleinAshman Blair says its partly a funnel issue and that, although it has become a lot cheaper to do a startup, it still often requires a period of time when a founder is able to support themselves between jobs One of the things she says that LocalGlobe believes helps it to get over the central casting mould  and something that does perhaps make the VC firm more peculiar than not  is the way its investment decision-making is structured",tech
"Once a hotly debated investment has been made, the whole LocalGlobe team are expected to get behind the startup, regardless of what doubts any individual team member may have had Once weve crossed the Rubicon then we are all in it and nobody turns around afterwards and says, I told you this was a problem with that company Thats totally unacceptable group behaviour, Robin Klein says Instead, it is acknowledged and accepted that there is a rate of failure and that everyone in the team will pick startups that succeed and startups that will failWe look for founder market fit, adds Henry",tech

"He and his father were both born in South Africa and Klein makes the point that London is often a great starting off point for entrepreneurs who want to operate in Africa, citing local knowledge and the citys historical ties He also believes that if and when African tech companies go public theyll choose to list in London over New York Its a small piece of what we do but were definitely starting to see more interesting deal flow, he says",tech
"My allotted two hours with the LocalGlobe team is nearly up, and  after noting that it is fairly unusual to spend this amount of time with almost the entire personnel of a VC firm  I thank Saul Klein for the opportunity and begin to wrap up the interview Dont you want to talk about the fund? Because I know that was meant to be the news, he teases with a wry smile Of course I reply matter-of-factly, before reminding him that it was the one part of the story I already had: I mean, whats there to say?

"The best case argument is that Apples support for QR codes will trigger a new marketing platform for brands and companies, or enable new interaction points for developers But, in countries were QR code scanning isnt commonplace, marketers and developers will need to explain this new trend in order to take advantage of itIt seems more advantageous to simply reach people through channels they are familiar with and accustomed to using",tech

"As one of the worlds most respected authorities on organizational transformationshe is uniquely qualified for the roleand we know we all have a lot to learn from her, said an Uber blog post about the appointment, which comes just before it is expected to release the results of an independent investigation into sexual harassment at the companyThe hiring of Frei is noteworthy because it signals a desire by Uber to change some of the aspects of its workplace and leadership cultureincluding a Hobbesian environment that rewarded cutthroat competition, sexual harassment that often went unchecked by HR (a blog post by former engineer Susan Fowler detailing repeated incidents finally triggered an investigation), and treating drivers more like software than human beingsOver the past few months, the fallout from these problems has started to snowball, and Uber has been hit with multiple lawsuits, the resignation of key executives, and boycotts",tech
"According to Freis HBS faculty bio, her research examines how leaders create the context for organizations and individuals to thrive and one of her classes investigates how organizations build business models that reliably delight customersHer other work includes a book titled Uncommon Service: How to Win by Putting Customers at the Core of Your Business, case studies on companies including eBay, Oracle, and the Cleveland Clinic, and research into womens leadership and diversity",tech
"A 2015 interview from the Harvard Business Review about rating systems like the five-star scale Uber uses for both drivers and passengers gives insight into the kind of advice Frei might offer the companyWhen asked what the next generation of customer rating systems might look like, Frei said, For both customer and employee ratings, organizations need to guard against process transcending purpose The purpose of these systems is to understand whats really going on, so we can improve it But process transcends purpose when Joe the exterminator says, I dont get paid unless you give me a 10 It was a great idea to solicit what customers thought, and what employees think, but that doesnt let you have the hook from having to manage",tech

"Its real, all right: when the person being stopped was white, officers were 57 percent more likely to use respectful phrases like apologies and thank-yous",tech
"On the whole, police interactions with black community members are more fraught than their interactions with white community members, said Jennifer Eberhardt, co-author of the study, in a Stanford news release But she also noted that our findings are not proof of bias or wrongdoing on the part of individual officers",tech
"These were well-behaved officers, said co-author Dan Jurafsky But the many small differences in how they spoke with community members added up to pervasive racial disparitiesIn order to sift through the many, many hours of traffic stops used in the study, the team first had ordinary people rate transcribed conversations for politeness, formality, respect, and other measures",tech
"As you can see, things like assuring safety and apologizing are more likely to occur in stops of white people, while informal names and asking for agency (negative because it implies wariness) show more in stops of black people And as you can also see, its far from clear cut  officers use both types of language in both cases, but over time a statistically significant pattern emerges",tech
"The findings do not shed light on the origin of this pattern, thoughThe racial disparities in officer respect are clear and consistent, yet the causes of these disparities are less clear, reads the study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences It is certainly possible that some of these disparities are prompted by the language and behavior of the community members themselves, particularly as historical tensions in Oakland and preexisting beliefs about the legitimacy of the police may induce fear, anger, or stereotype threatWhat we have here is a starting point, in other words: a verifiable pattern teased out (but importantly, not cherry picked) from the noisy, voluminous mass of data produced by body cameras Whats next? Deeper analysis could look at other aspects of speech, such as tone and slang, or take into account other factors of the people and locations involved",tech
"Simpy being aware of a factual, negative trend in the speech of officers of all races, towards the people of one race, is enough to start a conversation Who has noticed this before? Have they brought it up? Are officers aware theyre doing it? Policing can be data-driven, but ultimately its a community service, and in that community is where problems like this must be addressed in order to truly be solvedIm hopeful that, with the development of computational tools like ours, more law enforcement agencies will approach their body camera footage as data for understanding, rather than as evidence for blaming or exonerating, said Eberhardt",tech

"Users have downloaded more than 180 billion apps to date, noted App Store head Phil Schiller, and developers have made $70 billion from those apps to date, he addedThat said, Apple may not have been living up to one of its goals with the store  to make it a great opportunity for all developersWe continue to work really hard at that, Schiller saidThe Today tab, which is a new way to discover apps, is Apples big first step toward making the App Store feel more aliveApple says the content in the Today section will now be updated every day, and will feature new releases in a more in-depth fashion",tech
"Each day, there will be an App of the Day and Game of the Day listed on this page, to encourage repeat visits to the storeThe Today tab also will feature notable new releases",tech

"There are number of advantages to doing this For starters, it lets Apple separate out Games and Apps Top Charts, giving more apps and games exposure  especially those that would have otherwise been more lowly ranked due to having to compete with those apps that forever sit at the top of the charts  like Facebook or Pokmon GO, for instance",tech
"But it also gives both app and game developers new ways to market their work to consumers The Games page, for example, will now feature in-app purchases listed alongside apps, allowing developers to highlight their upgrades, such as their newly released characters or levelsThe system (or lack thereof) for app upgrades is something many developers have had issues with",tech
"If the game is on the Top Charts, this too will be shown right on its app page so you get a sense of its current popularitySimilarly, the new Apps section features the same design, including its own Top Charts, but one is just focused on the non-game appsThere are a slew of under-the-hood features arriving in the new store, too, but Apple just teased these briefly on a single slide But a quick peek at that slide shows the features Apple thought to highlight, like support for more TestFlight users, auto-renewal with Apple Pay, receipt enhancements, new design resources and moreOne of the more critical items  and one of the only from this section to get a shout-out  is the introduction of phased releases",tech
"The App Store has had quite an overhaul, even before today, under Schillers lead He also introduced App Store search ads, support for subscription-based apps where the split with Apple drops from 70/30 to 85/15 in year two and faster app review times",tech

"I cant say we were overly surprised that Apple made few changes to its laptop lineup It was possible that the company could have added an extra USB-C to the MacBooks to make things easier for customers looking to charge their phones while charging their computers, without a dongle  but even that would have been a fairly minor upgrade",tech

"Siri has run into quite a bit more competition over the past few years as Amazons Alexa voice assistant and Google Assistant have grown in their capabilities and made the shortcomings of Siris AI wits a bit more evident With these changes Apple is hoping to show off that its still the voice assistant to beat, though well have to wait until later this year to see for ourselvesSiri will now be able to handle follow-up questions, something that Google Assistant has long had, and will now allow Siri to answer more complex tiered questionsThe less broadcasted headline of the event is that Apple is increasingly thinking of Siri as more of a general AI that extends through iOS rather than simply a voice assistant In iMessages for instance, Siri on iOS is getting a bit more sensitive to your context",tech
"Hardcore Mac fans may have had their fingers crossed for the return of the Mac Pro, but an extra i slipped in there somehow, and Apple instead has produced an iMac Pro Its a wallet-busting all-in-one workstation, and it looks handsome and sinister in a dark grey finish",tech
"The iMac Pro has more or less the same look and feel as the 27-inch, 5K iMac we first saw in 2015 (though now its more like the $5K iMac, am I right?)",tech
"Considerately, there is a nice little spread of ports on the back:Thats your SDXC port, 4 USB 3 ports, 4 Thunderbolt (not Lightning) ports, Ethernet and  is that a headphone jack? Courageous!Its a nod to the professionals who love Macs but were dismayed by the recent MacBook Pro refresh making a clean sweep of all the legacy ports  i",tech
"The price for this beast of a computer starts at $4,999 for a base configuration and, as you might imagine, rises precipitously from there (Apple was careful to compare it to similarly priced workstations, not all-in-ones or ordinary desktops)That iMac pro really is pretty badass, said Tim Cook after the reveal It ships in DecemberAdvertisementiOS 11 was the least surprising announcement of WWDC",tech
"With iOS 11, stickers and iMessage apps are now more accessible with a shortcut drawer  theres no need to tap multiple times to send a sticker Now, conversations are automatically synchronized with iCloud and stay in sync If you delete a message, it goes away everywhere So say goodbye to the good old avalanche of outdated messages on your Mac when you come back from vacationWhen it comes to Apple Pay, you can now send money to other Apple Pay users  think Venmo or Square Cash",tech
Siri is one of the big new updates in iOS 11 Siri is used on 375 million devices every month,tech
"And Siri is getting better at understanding the context, your interests and more Apple calls this Siri intelligence and it affects the entire operating system When somebody asks you how far are you?, iOS will look at your calendar to see where youre supposed to go and suggest the answer in Messages",tech

"One good example of how the map can help environmental scientists in the Bay Area is the ability to track higher pollution due to cars speeding up near the Bay Bridge to cross under or merge onto I-80, which is a freeway with frequent traffic congestion that goes beyond just rush hour and can sometimes even be affected on the weekendsIn a Google blog post, out today, Google claimed its pollution data set to be the largest ever published,With nearly 3 million measurements and 14,000 miles captured in the course of a year, and said it could apply the data to other cities in the futureApple just refreshed their iMac line, and while the external design will stay the same, the company has put a ton of effort into refreshing the insides to make them competitive with other professional-grade computersAnd, not surprisingly, most of the focus was on adding enough specs to make sure Macs can run VR applications for both consumers and developersAll of the models will be getting new GPUs",tech
"Outside of graphics, Apple is also refreshing the screen on the iMac, making it 43 percent brighter than the previous generation",tech
"The 215-inch model will also now support up to 32GB of RAM, and the 27-inch model will support 64GB of RAM",tech
"Also, the Fusion Drive is coming to all 27-inch models, and the entire lineup will get 7th Generation Intel Core Kaby Lake chipsThis refresh will make the new iMac really compelling for developers, especially those waiting for more powerful machines Oculus once said that they dont support Macs because they arent powerful enough to run a VR rig Not anymoreVirtual reality is coming to Macs, sort of",tech

"All of this is enabled by Metal 2s new support for external graphics, which will allow you to connect your Mac via Thunderbolt to an external GPU thats a bit more beefy than the integrated graphics on the MacBooks and the less blazing graphics cards on desktop",tech
"Metal 2 has a new VR-optimized display pipeline alongside viewport arrays and stereoscopic visualization frame debuggers that should allow VR developers a great way to build content on the MacApple had a few VR demos to show off, specifically one from Star Wars made by Lucas Films Industrial Light and Magic In a mixed reality demo, ILM showcased VR creation inside VR drag-and-dropping ships and Darth Vader himselfMetal for VR ships with macOS High SierraNo one likes being stalked around the internet by ads for something they once looked at or have previously bought",tech
"The feature will use machine learning technology to powertracker blocking in a bid to outwit the digital stalkers, according to FederighiSafari uses machine learning to identify trackers, segregate the cross-site scripting data, put it away so now your privacy  your browsing history  is your own, he explained",tech
"Its not about blocking ads, the web behaves as it always did, but your privacy is protected, he addedThere are plenty of questions here  such as how effective the tech will prove versus ad industry ingenuity; whether it will be enabled by default; and how much configuration consumers will be offered Not to mention whether Apple will be extending the blocker to the mobile version of Safari But its a positive step for privacyThe explosive proliferation of online trackers in recent years  which not only intrude on web users privacy but can add serious lag to page load times too  has led to the rise of browser extensions for tracker blocking",tech
"One of these standalones, Ghostery, was recently acquired by a pro-privacy browser called Cliqz, for example",tech
"Apple has clearly spotted what it feels is growing appetite for web users to have more control over their browsing privacyUpdate: A little more detail on how the tracker blocker will function can be found on Apples Webkit blog, where it notes that its building on long-standing Webkit features aimed at reducing tracking (such as default blocking third-party cookies) with the new machine learning-powered tracker blocker, and that in its testing process it found popular websites with more than 70 cross-site tracking/third-party cookie trackers  all silently collecting data on usersIntelligent Tracking Prevention [ITP] is a new WebKit feature that reduces cross-site tracking by further limiting cookies and other website data, writes Apples John Wilander in the blog Intelligent Tracking Prevention collects statistics on resource loads as well as user interactions such as taps, clicks, and text entries The statistics are put into buckets per top privately-controlled domain or TLD+1",tech
"Apple then applies a machine learning model toclassify which top privately controlled domains have the ability to track the user cross-site, based on the collected statistics It notes that alldata collection and classification happens on-deviceThe ITP system analyzes the frequency of a users interaction with the websites they visit, automatically purging a sites cookies entirely after 30 days if the person does not visit the site and ensuring its cookies cannot add new data so long as they dont use the siteHowever, if they do visit again, the tracker blocker temporarily adjusts how it responds  by, for example, allowing cookies in a third-party context for a one-day window before shutting that off if the person does not visit the site after 24 hours In thisscenario the cookies are partitioned, which means users can stay logged in to sites they only visit occasionally but those sites cookies are restricted for cross-site tracking purposes",tech
"This means users only have long-term persistent cookies and website data from the sites they actually interact with and tracking data is removed proactively as they browse the web, adds WilanderTheres arguably a pretty big distinction between Apple dynamically shuttering the ability of websites that users of its browser arent actively using to deploy cross-site trackers which silently harvest those same consumers browsing habits in the background  a practice web users have long voiced loud discomfort about (ie",tech

"The watchface can also show your smart home controls, boarding passes, the sunset time, and other items, including even suggested news stories in the Siri interface",tech
The Activity app has also gotten a minor update with watchOS 4,tech
"However, some of the less sexy but more exciting features involve things that are arriving under the hood Native core bluetooth support, for example, is coming to Apple Watch That means the watch will be able to better support hardware like glucose sensors and other real-time accessories, like a smart tennis rackets, for instance",tech
"Plus, WatchOS 4 introduces a mode called Gym Connect, which allows you to sync directly with gym equipment like treadmills and ellipticals This works by pairing the watch with an NFC sensor on the equipment itself from partners including Life Fitness, Cybex, Schwinn, Startrac, and StairMaster",tech
"WatchOS 4 will ship in the fall as a free update Its arriving for developers todayAs expected, Apple today announced the next version of macOS, the desktop operating system you probably still refer to as OS X",tech
"Last September, the previous version of macOS went live under the Sierra moniker The highlight of that release was the addition of Siri on the desktop I dont know many people who use it, but those who do surely find it useful Other new features included the ability for apps to open new windows as tabs (just like you do in a browser), support for Apple Pay on the desktop, hands-free unlock with the help of a nearby Apple Watch, as well as updates to virtually all the default apps that now ship with macOS, like Messages and PhotosHate it when sites blast you with auto-play video? Well Apple is swooping in to fight this scourge with the addition of an auto-play-video-blocking feature to the new Safari browser for its upcoming macOS High Sierra desktop operating system",tech
"Auto-play video can be convenient when its predictable and only happens when a video is on screen, like in some social apps But when a text news article suddenly starts blaring sound from an ad or auto-play video player in the sidebar, its infuriating and an abuse of our attentionPublishers have reacted to Google and Facebook sucking up their ad revenue by resorting to these user-hostile tactics",tech

"Form Cell is an array of up to five connected Form 2s, plus the companys new Wash and Cure systems, which help put the finishing touches on the prints by dunking them in an alcohol solution for cleaning and zapping then with a little extra light to complete the curing process A robot arm attached to the rig moves the prints from one station to the next, as seen in the above video",tech
"The whole process can be controlled remotely, and the system can be operated as lights out manufacturing, meaning no one has to be present while the machine does its thing Its a stupidly simple solution, really  just plug a bunch of existing machines into a new remote-controlled framework That kind of modular solution is a cost cutting measure",tech

"Today, face-editing tools are everywhere Apps like Snapchat let you morph into different creaturesAnd FaceApp had its 15 minutes of fame for letting you take a pic of yourself or someone else and view that same picture in a foursquare as a younger person, an older person, and with changed gender (yes, sometimes controversially)Facebook has snapped up Msqrd, Apple acquired Faceshift, and weve heard others are also on the hunt for their own tech and talent in computer vision and neural network processing (two cornerstones behind how a lot of these apps work), to built out virtual reality and augmented reality applications, expand their video services, and keep consumers entertainedMicrosoft also wants to be in on the action, and its actually starting with a very substantial trove of its own assets",tech
"A spokesperson confirmed to us that the new Face Swap app was built using 3D face modelling from the computer vision team at Microsoft Research (that is, the tech that went into the old Face Swap app)",tech
"But while Bing  like all search engines  is predicated on audiences, advertising, and people clicking on lines for its business model, the same does not go for the Bing-powered Face SwapSearch & transport yourself into fun & inspirational scenes, Microsoft notes on its YouTube video (embedded below) showing off the wonders of Face Swap",tech
"Time will tell if the no-ad rule remains, and indeed if the app takes off at all There is a lot of heated competition",tech

"AI can help keep students motivated by customizing courses based on speed of learning and relative weaknesses, while AR and VR can make learning more immersive and interactive Moving away from our legacy school system will be difficult given unions and political nearsightedness, but a better system can emerge if we allow it",tech
"While we think those three industries will see great disruption through the next tech wave, there will obviously be great businesses in tech-forward spaces like entertainment and gaming",tech
"The framework helps us put into context the relative rarity of a company creating something at the OS layer, the opportunities in optimizing specific parts of the technology platforms of the future and what industry segments are ripest for innovation So the mantra applied to us is:If we can invest in a great team building a potential OS layer, we will If we cant find OS-layer companies, well look for ones that are optimizing components of the computing platforms of the future",tech

"Comprehensive  No matter what you want to hear about, Noto says Twitter has a strong selection of content about every topicDiscussion  People respond to tweets, create a richer and more engaging experiencePersonalization  Because Twitter knows who you follow and what tweets you interact with, it can show you the most relevant content",tech
"Noto didnt spell out why charging a subscription fee to everyone would conflict with these traits, but heres whats implied:Fewer Tweeters  Twitter breaks news first because anyone who sees or learns something important can instantly share it Charging would deter or disenfranchise some people from tweeting, so news and commentary would slow down because it would have to wait until it was spotted by someone who paysThinner Coverage  Twitter has eyes and ears all over the world because its free",tech
"On the other hand, charging for premium TweetDeck features could be seen as a way to help journalists and power users react more quickly to Twitter content, follow a wider range of topics efficiently, contribute to more discussions nimbly and interact with more content to produce data for personalization",tech

"The test started small Launched in April, there are only two stores in New Jersey and one in northwest Arkansas that are running this program today But Walmart is already touting how the early results are promising",tech

"Today, staff use a proprietary mobile app to opt in to the program and configure things like how many packages they want to deliver, the size and weight limits theyre comfortable with, and which days theyre willing to make deliveries after work using their own vehicle Workers also have to submit to additional background checks, motor vehicle record inspections and provide proof of insuranceA lot of technology has gone into the development of this program, hinting that this test is being seriously considered as an alternative way to handle last-mile deliveries at scale",tech
"Staff can also enter in other destinations theyre heading to after work, then be shown delivery stops along those routes",tech
"In addition, Walmart has done a lot of work on its backend order management system to make this delivery program viable for both Jetcom and Walmartcom online orders",tech

"Walmarts advantage, too, is its stores The company has 4,700 U",tech

"Its beena year since the four major social platform players agreed with Europes executive body to a voluntary Code of Conduct for removing illegal hate speech within 24 hours of a complaint being receivedA lot has happened on this front since then, with a series of content moderation scandals hitting different platforms and serving to ramp up the regional pressure on the tech giants  including YouTube suffering an advertiser backlash over ads being served up next to extremist content; and Facebook accused of a series ofmoderation failures, including around child abuse and terrorist content Not to mention fake news gate",tech
"In Germany the government is now leaning towards legislating to levy fines of up to 50 millionon social media platforms if they do not remove illegal hate speech promptly  claiming tech giants have not been doing enough (a UK parliamentary committee also concluded more needs to be done last month, and has urged the government to consider introducing fines as well)But today the European Commission, at least, is trumpeting what it dubs significant progress on illegal hate speech takedowns by Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Microsoft vs their performance six months prior",tech
"A majority of illegal hate speech is now being removedThe evaluation of the voluntary Code of Conduct, a year in, found that on average in a majority (59 per cent) of cases the tech platforms responded to notifications concerning illegal hate speech by removing the content  which constitutes a more than 2x rise on the removal level recorded (28 per cent) in the first evaluation of the code, six months ago",tech
"It also found an improvement in the amount of notifications reviewed within 24 hours  up from 40 per cent to a majority (51 per cent) in the same six month periodAlthough it notes that Facebook is the only company that fully achieves the target of reviewing the majority of notifications within the dayOther areas for improvement the evaluation highlights are discrepancies between when a citizen reports content vs when an organization reports contentSo while it notes some progress on this front, with tech platforms apparently improving how they handle citizen complaints, it also says some differences persist, and that overall removal rates remain lower when a notification originates from the publicThe evaluation also points to ongoing discrepancies between tech platforms in their feedback systems for users who report content  with only Facebook sending systematic feedback to inform a person how theirnotification has been assessed",tech
"Practices differed considerably among the IT companies Quality of feedback motivating the decision is an area where further progress can be made, it addsThe EC is drawing on an evaluation carried out in 24 Member States by NGOs and public bodies for this assessment",tech
"Making some general observations, the evaluation said that within the last year the four platform giants have strengthened their reporting systems and made it easier to report hate speech",tech
They have also trained staff and  in the ECs words  increased their cooperation with civil society,tech
"The EC further suggests the Code of Conduct has helped tackle the spread of illegal hate speech in the region bystrengthening and enlarging the tech firms network of trusted flaggers throughout EuropeAnd it argues that via increased co-operation with civil society organizations the tech platforms have gained a higher quality of notifications, which in turn is yielding more effective handling times and better results in terms of reactions to the notificationsVra Jourov, the European Union commissioner for justice, consumers and gender equality, described the results of the one-year evaluation as encouraging",tech
"This is an important step in the right direction and shows that a self-regulatory approach can work, if all actors do their part, she said in a statement",tech
"At the same time, companies carry a great responsibility and need to make further progress to deliver on all the commitments For me, it is also important that the IT companies provide better feedback to those who notified cases of illegal hate speech content, she added",tech
"In another supporting statement, Andrus Ansip, the ECs VP for the digital single market, added: Working closely with the private sector and civil society to fight illegal hate speech brings results, and we will redouble our joint efforts",tech
We are now working to ensure closer coordination between the different initiatives and forums that we have launched with online platforms,tech
"We are determined to keep doing better and live up to the high standards that people rightly expect of us We recently announced that we would be adding another 3,000 staff to our global team of reviewers We are also looking at how we can use the latest technology to help our review teams identify and prioritise high risk content",tech
"In a statement, Karen White, Twitters head of public policy in Europe, added: At Twitter, we strive to reach the right balance between showing all sides of whats happening and tackling hateful conduct Over the past six months, weve introduced a host of new tools and features to improve Twitter for everyone",tech
"Twitter is also stepping up its efforts to inform users of existing tools they can use to manage which content they do and dont see on its platform (or manage your experience as it puts it)  and is currently sending the below email notification to users in Europe to flag up what it describes as three key tools for staying safe  namely:MuteRather than see content in Tweets youd like to avoid, you can manage what you see in your timeline and notifications Mute accounts, words, and conversationsNotification FiltersGet an extra level of control by filtering the types of accounts you see in your notifications",tech

"Lets look at some of the technological shifts:Bloated web pages: We are fat, getting fatter",tech
"The growth of video: As the CDNs attempt to deliver bloated pages, the type of content has shifted The demand for video / live streaming / dynamic application content continues to grow",tech
"Optimizing traffic routes over diverse network pathways (ISP, 3G, mobile), balancing load / peak demand and ensuring security is now expected of CDNs",tech
"Teridion acts like the Waze of internet traffic and optimizes traffic routes using third-party cloud Its platform helps make real-time packet routing decisions to avoid congested paths Unlike CDNs, its solution scales on demand and is not limited by upstream communication, pre-provisioned PoPs, geography or cloud providers",tech
"While CDNs aim for improved security, CDNs themselves can be vulnerable In his blog post, David Hobbs writes about several CDN security challenges that include dynamic content attacks, SSL-based attacks and direct IP attacks",tech
Cloudbleed and the recent AWS S3 problems were both good ole bugs  longstanding interactions between complex systems that often go unnoticed,tech
"So far, DDoS attacks against web sites was well-known, but this was the first time when a DoS attack can be launched against a CDN itself by one of its customers Its often easy to sign up for a CDN and get a free account Launching a forward loop attack is not too difficult",tech
"Andrew Petersen, CEO of Signal Sciences, is building the next-generation Web Access Firewall (WAF) that combines security with usability for the DevOps world Having faced these challenges in his previous life at Etsy, Andrew and his team have taken a bottoms-up approach",tech
"CDNs cant get deployed on internal apps As multiple security tools have to be used it gets harder to manage quickly If we take a step back, CDNs primary focus is speed Philosophically and technically, this creates trade-offs with performance Petersen saysIn his blog post, Zane Lackey, co-founder of Signal Sciences, identified six appsec challenges that CDNs may struggle to solve",tech
"The modern-day CDN should do a lot more (Image Courtesy: StackPath)James Leaverton, VP Ecosystem Development, StackPath, says, Legacy CDNs are not ready for the shifts to online video and IoT",tech
"To manage traffic, CDNs use different types of reverse proxies such as squid cache, Nginx or Varnish Cache In a containerized environment, you could have multiple reverse proxies to choose from In his blog post titled CDNs are dying, Stewart argues that engineers should not feel locked into any one proxy software stack at any one time",tech
"As technology needs evolve, innovators are often able offer better solutions and expand certain markets Ernie Regalado of Bizety writes that the CDN market is likely to be much larger, especially as hungry CDNs invade others tech sectors seeking new revenue streams",tech
"Betting on the winnersOn one end, web companies like Facebook, Netflix, Pandora and even Apple have shifted to managing their own content delivery Legacy CDNs are left with no choice but to evolve Should the giant Akamai worry about the cold CloudFront blowing in from Seattle?

"View this document on ScribdMicrosoft today is launching a completely revamped version of its Skype application, with a new set of features that draw obvious inspiration from messaging rivals, like Messenger and Snapchat",tech
"If social networks have given you the stage on which to perform your life, the new Skype gives you the additional equivalent of the local coffeehouse or corner pub, where you meet people on a daily basis to deepen your relationships, explains Amritansh Raghav, Corporate Vice President of Skype, about the new designs focus on enhancing users real social connections",tech
"We call that set of interactions your personal network, he saysThe idea with the revamp is to make Skype a better tool for the sort of communication and sharing that takes place among members of Skypes more closely connected network, which often includes family and friends That means Skype is tacking on ephemeral sharing as part of its feature set, along with Stories, and other camera-first inspired features",tech
Its also today rolling out its own set of bots and chat add-ins to rival Facebook Messenger,tech
"Highlights  Skypes take on StoriesIn the new version of Skypes app, you can just swipe to pull up the camera  a now familiar interaction, thanks to the camera-first design found in todays social appsYou can then snap a photo or video  which you can then of course decorate with typed or handwritten text, as well as with Skypes own set of stickers  very much like on other appsIn the new version of Skype, your snapped photos and videos can be shared with individuals, in group chats, or can be posted to a new feature called Highlights",tech
"The camera is available when you swipe right from the main screen, while Highlights are found when swipe left",tech
"Highlights are Skypes own take on Stories  something the company readily admitsIts like Facebook has said, saysRaghav, referencing remarks made by Facebooks VP of messaging David Marcus, who recently argued that Stories is definitely a format, the same way the feed is a formatRaghav agrees The feed is now commonly used in a range of apps  even those that arent personal social networks, like Microsofts business communications service YammerTheres a new medium that has risen, he says of Stories",tech
"However, Skype has tweaked the Stories format a bitFor starters, its Highlights are available for a week, not a day",tech
"However, you can choose to share your Highlights with individual contacts or groups you manually select  a move which nudges the recipients to follow your Highlights if they dont already, but doesnt allow you to spam them with updates",tech
"Followers can also react to Highlights posts, as they can to any Skype post, with an emoji Here, Skype has copied from Facebooks reactions  you can thumbs up (like), heart (favorite), or post emoji faces for reactions like sad, surprised, laughing, and angry You can also type a response thats then shared privately in a chatBots & Add-insThe other major feature rolling out today is an expanded selection of Skypes bots and add-ins Microsoft envisions how youll be able to chat directly with its virtual assistant Cortana, or its newer assistant Scoop, which pulls in news from MSN",tech
"In chats, Cortana will be able to make suggestions, including quick responses like LOL or cant wait, or others related to your conversations Scoop, meanwhile, offers a one-on-one chat with personalized news story suggestions and summaries, but can also live in a group chat to share stories relevant to that groups conversationsMicrosofts demo showed a number bots and add-ins, like Cortana, Scoop, Gfycat, Giphy, MSN Weather, Search (Bing), Polls, Expedia, Stubhub, BigOven (cooking), YouTube, and Upworthy, to name a few However, Cortana will not launch until June in the US",tech
"Group Chats and moreThough Highlights and add-ins are the standout new features, theres a lot thats different in the revamped SkypeFor example, you can now personalize the apps theme by picking your favorite colors, react to anything in a chat with an emoticon, or even react using emoticons in video calls  a move that will temporarily overlay a big emoticon and colored background in your window for other callers to see",tech
"You can also now type a message when on video calls which is shown in much the same way  something that could be helpful for when youre on a group call, but dont want to talk",tech
"Video chats are also going to be upgraded in the future to support other types of interactions, including the ability to play games with friends or watch videos from streaming services together Co-watching in groups is an area where a number of social apps are trying to gain traction  including Cabana from Tumblr, Uptime from YouTube, Fam, and othersYouTube will be among the first services added for co-watching, were told, but Skype is having discussions with other streaming services about integrations Meanwhile, gaming will initially leverage existing Microsoft assets like Minecraft, Solitaire, Mah Jongg and othersThe new Skype is available on Android today, and will hit iOS in a months time",tech

"As we wrote last November:The regulation would require instant messaging services and other internet companies to require users to register with their real names and personal information, and to censor content that is prohibited Real name policies restrict anonymity and can encourage self-censorship for online communicationThe law also includes a requirement for data localization, which would force critical information infrastructure operators to store data within Chinas borders",tech
"Foreign companies have argued for more clarity and more time to implement the controls that the government wants put in place, but so far Chinas internet regulator, The Cyberspace Administration of China, has only relented on pushing back the date for laws relating to the cross-border flow of informationAccording to a report inThe New York Times, those rules wont be implemented until 2018China does have legitimate security concerns Thanks to lax intellectual property laws and rampant software piracy, the country was especially vulnerable to the WannaCry attacks from earlier in the monthThe South China Morning Post reported that more than 30,000 institutions, including some major universities, had systems that were infected with the malware",tech
But critics of the legislation say that it does far more than secure the internet  it wraps Chinas already firmly held internet even more tightly in the governments embrace,tech
"As we wrote back in November:According to Human Rights Watch, an advocacy organization that is opposing the legislation, the law does not include a clear definition of infrastructure operators, and many businesses could be lumped into the definitionThe law will effectively put Chinas Internet companies, and hundreds of millions of Internet users, under greater state control, saidSophie Richardson, Human Rights Watchs China director",tech

"Apple may finally get overtaken by Android in developer revenues this year (or so the analysts say), but today the iPhone maker passed a milestone of its own: the company said it has passed $70 billion in payouts to app developers, up from $50 billion about a year ago, after taking its commission",tech
"And despite the fact that new smartphone purchases appear to have fallen off a cliff as many large markets reach saturation, growing just three percent in the last year, there is still a strong motor behind the apps ecosystemApple says that in the past year (12 months), downloads are up over 70 percent, led by top games like Pokmon GO and Super Mario Run but also a range of other apps that include CancerAid, SPACE by THIX, Zones for Training with Exercise Intensity, Vanido, Ace Tennis and Havenly",tech
"Indeed, perhaps unsurprisingly (this has been the case for years now) games and entertainment also continue to lead in terms of top-grossing categories Lifestyle apps, as well as Health and Fitness, have experienced over 70 percent growth in the past year, Apple said, while photo and video are the fastest-growing up nearly 90 percent in the last yearThe comments come in the lead up to Apples annual developers conference, WWDC, and as such is a timely announcement",tech

"ICOs operate by selling investors cryptocurrency, which can be used to store value in many ways beyond a traditional share For its sale, Brave created its own coin The Basic Attention Token, or BAT  and sold one billion of them",tech
"The ICO is the highest grossing to date, and Braves business itself is one of the more interesting to make use the blockchain",tech
"Kik, a messaging service popular with young people in North America, recently announced plans for its own Kin coin which it will use as a virtual currency to pay for related goods and services, and thats the same approach Brave has taken It plans to use BAT the currency for its advertising system, which it claims can reduce ad fraud and increase efficiencies for publishers and advertisers",tech
"More immediately, it said it will use the proceeds of this ICO to develop its advertising platformOne notable anecdote of the Brave ICO is how the process was dominated by a handful of individuals Only around 130 people actually bought BAT, Coindesk noted, with one buyer scooping up $46 million of them (20,000 ETH worth) All in all, Coindesk reported that five buyers acquired half of the total haul, while the 20 biggest spenders bought two-thirds of the available coins",tech
"That situation runs counter to the thesis that many in Ethereum hold, which is that token sales enable anyone to take ownership of the companies they use or follow",tech
"Founded by Tushar Agarwal (CEO), Tom Watson (CTO) and Rohan Silva (founder of Second Home, and former advisor to ex-British Prime Minister David Cameron), the company began life helping startups find spare office space However, it has since expanded its platform to also serve the needs of traditional SMEs and larger corporates  and, Im told, is seeing a huge uptick in companies wanting more flexibility since the result of the Brexit referendum",tech
"More broadly, Agarwal tells me, Hubbles growth is a reflection of how the commercial property market is shifting away from lengthy, multi-year office space leases to short term rentals with out of the box features, and therefore less commitment or costs up frontIts also a change, he argues, that traditional property letting agents arent well-positioned to cope with and where technology is the only way to scale because of the increase in the sheer number of transactions, which also typically carry a lower basket priceTo that end, as it stands, Hubble operates an online marketplace that matches companies needing flexible office space with landlords and commercial space providers, such as the WeWorks of this world",tech
"With todays new capital, however  and to better serve its growing client base  the startup is building out its platform to act more like a digital commercial property advisor that will better use the data Hubble has and is accumulating to automate the office space search process in a more personal or bespoke way",tech
"Adds Agarwal in a statement: Hubble is the driving force behind a trend that is seeing traditional commercial property agents quickly becoming obsolete As technology has enabled the number of freelancers and SMEs in the world to grow at an unprecedented rate, they are rapidly displacing Fortune 500 companies from the physical real estate they traditionally occupy  the bread and butter of traditional agents The economics of the labour intensive model of property agents just dont stack up with the future of workJulie Desk, a French startup thats developed an AI-driven virtual assistant to automate the scheduling of meetings, appointments, and more, has picked up 25 million in new funding  money it plans to use to further develop the technology",tech
S,tech
"One other interesting aspect of Julie Desk  and something Hobeika is refreshingly candid about  is that the startup openly operates a hybrid model, with its AI being underpinned by continuous human supervision It sees a human check every final appointment made and editing the very few that arent correct, whilst in turn further training the startups algorithms",tech

"As a Dominican who grew up on welfare in the Bronx, he is sharing this story about an aspect of his life that few people know about in an effort to inspire those who grew up like him  those without the privileges that most people who work for startups take for grantedYsiad and I were roommates at Agapeand this episode goes into detail about how a strong sales organization is structured at the seed stage, the types of candidates that get hired, sales fundamentals, compensation, struggles with background checks, second chances, and moreFamily and the Importance of Education:Ysiads mother immigrated as a teenager from the Dominican Republic, raised him as a single parent and his first language was Spanish",tech
"He learned English in elementary school and was fortunate enough to earn a spot in a program calledPrep for Prep, which in turn got him a scholarship toHorace Mann, a private school in New York CityHe got into the University of Pennsylvania on a full Annenberg Scholarship, but quickly dropped out due to a couple of factors:Impatience",tech
"Wait, probation and prison?Yea, that might surprise anyone who arrived here from a Google search, Twitter, or a blog post about product updates, so lets back up a few years",tech
Getting to Horace Mann was both a source of pride and embarrassment,tech
Pride: It is one of the best high schools in the United States and it was a privilege to go thereEmbarrassment: His scholarship didnt cover school lunches or the school busFighting Starvation By Any Means NecessaryYsiads mother was raising his family on public assistance,tech
"For those of you that dont know, if you are on public assistance your children get free meals at public schools",tech
Getting to school alone presented its own challenges because there was a gang war going on in the late 90s in NYC and he had to cross several of them on his way to classHe used a bicycle until the bicycle was stolen After that he ran to school with his backpack,tech
"Even though Ysiad is Dominican, gangs would target him for initiations because he looked white and after a number of physical altercations, he got worn downFor protection and respect, he decided to start his own crew and built a reputation in the neighborhood Things escalated",tech
"Bad Decisions and Their ConsequencesWhile he had the goal of earning enough money so his mother and sisters wouldnt have to steal, he was comfortable doing whatever he had to do in order to put food on the tableHe sold illegal cable boxes to his classmates, stole from the cafeteria, and even from many of his classmates",tech
"By age 15, he found himself in a management position in a criminal enterprise Fast forward a bit, and the result of this was him pleading guilty to robbery in the first degree, possession of stolen property, and assault with a deadly weaponThats how he got on probation from the ages of 16 to 21",tech
"First, he caused his family stress and shameSecond, he feared that if people found out what he had done, the truth would inhibit him from achieving his goals of making something of himself, financially supporting his family, and getting out of the Bronx",tech
"Secrets and Reflection on Past ActionsYsiad figured out how to keep his arrest, subsequent plea, and probation status a secret from his classmates and the administration at his school If they had found out, they definitely would have expelled him",tech
"By then he was old enough to work so he quit the after-school sports teams he was a part of, found a computer on a train, and got a job as a computer programmer (more detail on that in the podcast)From that point forward, he would pay for his own food instead of stealing it",tech
"He lied on his college applications saying he hadnt been arrested, and was accepted into a number of Ivy League universities with full scholarshipsHe accepted a spot at the University of PennsylvaniaIn retrospect, he is 100% confident that he could have found a way to buy food and commute to school safely without engaging in criminal activityBut he also empathizes with his 15-year-old self Being an at-risk youth means not always having the privilege and perspective to think strategically",tech
The 17 Year-Old Hustle: Probation and Dropping Out of CollegeAttending UPenn required updates to Ysiads Probation Officer on his whereabouts and he was not allowed to change states without getting permission ahead of time,tech
"He also had to stay out of trouble completely and a single probation violation not only risked further shame to his family, but would also mean 12 or more years of incarceration at an adult facilityThe location requirement made it impossible for him to join a sports team or club that interacted with other universities Staying out of trouble meant that he could not safely participate in the sorts of social activities his peers were a part of",tech
"Each one was a little more successful than the last As they were all self-funded, he had to learn to bootstrap and inspire people to work with him despite not having money to pay fixed salaries That typically meant hiring people of non-traditional backgrounds, helping them quickly grow to the responsibilities that needed to be met, and working on projects that generated cash-flow quickly enough to pay everyone",tech
"Somewhere along the line a former employee introduced him to a friend of his who had a lucrative career as a consultant for hedge funds He started staying up late reading financial books, brought his computer programming skills up to a professional level, got an internship at a hedge fund, and then leveraged that position to get a formal interview with that friend of a friend where he convinced him to take a chance on him",tech
"The company was still small enough that it did not conduct background checks, so shortly thereafter, Ysiad began consultingClients started asking for Ysiad by name, and there was more work than the company could handleThe next challenge was to build a successful teamYsiads previous experience hiring people of nontraditional backgrounds proved very helpful because his talent pool was wider and he was able to hire people quicker than their competitorsEverything was going well until the company grew to approximately 30 people and started running background checks",tech
"He had finally reached a different socioeconomic status, but had to give it up because of his struggles with background checksYsiad did what a lot of young rich people do when they need to process things and take time offhe went into nature, bicycled a thousand miles from Boston to Ann Arbor, took an international trip (moving to India for a year and a half), and did some feel-good, yet light hearted charity work where he and a friend came up with the idea of The International Day of HappinessThat idea led to a resolution by the United Nations, and The International Day of Happiness is now on March 20th every year",tech
"After all of that reflection, he decided to move to San Francisco, where he thought organizations might be less likely to run background checks on their employeesThe Purpose Driven OrganizerIn San Francisco, he lived in house calledAgapewith Cory Rae Shaw  Hustles first graphic designer  andPerry Rosenstein  one of Hustles founders",tech
"Perry was always talking about politics, but Ysiad had always been pretty skeptical of politics",tech
"When Ysiad was growing up, politicians and activists from outside of his community would approach his neighborhood and tell them that if they wanted change, they needed to vote",tech
"Their messages sounded great, but Ysiad learned to be wary of politicians and the campaign workers who worked to get them elected because he felt that most of them were full of empty promises that led to zero results or things that were contradictory to their initial messageAs Perry and Ysiad continued their conversations, Perry kept saying that while many of Ysiads concerns were true, Hustles platform was not only being used by organizers reaching LatinX and other underserved communities in ways that had never been done, but also helping them build power leading to actual results",tech
"When Ysiad saw the ~90%+ open rates, ~3050% engagement from Perrys initial groups, he thought about other use cases in criminal justice from his interactions with his probation officers, ways to speak to his neighborhood through community leaders they trusted, and immediately agreed to do some consulting to help with sales and marketingNew BeginningsYsiad soon saw that the work Hustle was doing changed the ways that he thought about politics and activismWhen he first joined Hustle, he was focused on political issues like immigration reform and for the cost of less than a single postcard, he was able to bridge the digital divide by helping campaign organizers send personalized texts to people across targeted groups",tech
"If the organizers wanted to reach people like Ysiads mom, who primarily speaks Spanish, they could communicate with them by text in their constituents preferred language",tech
This allowed campaigns to develop appropriate messaging in a variety of languages to reach everyone in a comfortable and respectful way,tech
"Ysiad helped organizers use Hustle to send over 60 million messages to 12 million people and got the platform into the hands of reputable advocacy groups, non-profits, and labor unions with phenomenal resultsHustle is quickly expanding its strong position in politics and labor, but is also working on expanding verticals and empowering leaders in education, faith communities, healthcare, call centers, and moreAs someone in an executive position at a fast growing startup, Ysiad now feels the responsibility to help people that have been struggling to overcome decisions they may have made in their past that affect their background in a negative wayMaybe they have a criminal record like he does, or maybe they dont look or sound like what people expect them to Whatever their story is, Ysiad is a Dominican from the Bronx that cant knock the hustle when he sees itAlso, make sure you subscribe to the Breaking Into Startups Podcast on iTunes",tech

"Mapping City PowerC40 produced a range of power maps, showing the relative power of local government over activities and assets like sidewalks, airports, cycling, water, power distribution",tech
Example: powerExample: sidewalksWe often meet founders who want to access sidewalk infrastructure like light posts or bus shelters Its clear that city government has significant power over these assets Whats less clear is how city government will respond to different sidewalk activities,tech
"Example: cyclingCity governments have significant power over sidewalks and they also control roads So they certainly have the power to build out bike infrastructure like bike lanes and bike parking What happens when cities also start to hire bikeshare operators?The current bikeshare model presumes that you need space on the sidewalk and road for the docking systems used to manage bikeshare But a new generation of bikeshare can be deployed without the need for any docking startups That is, they need the same amount of space as a privately owned bike",tech

"Strong encryption,cryptic answersThe problem  as always in this recurring data accessvs strong encryption story  is that companies thatuse end-to-end encryption to safeguard user data are not able to hand over information in a readable form as they do not holdthe encryption keys to be able to decrypt itSo the question remainshow canthe government compel companies to hand over informationthey dont have access to?Will it do so by outlawing the use of end-to-end encryption?

"But again, if the latest reporting is to be believed, Rudd is intent on breaking strong encryption after allExceptional access, unacceptable riskIts worth revisitingKeys Under Doormats; aka the paper written by a group ofstoried security researchers back in 2015, re-examining the notion ofso-called exceptional access for security agencies to encryption systems  at a time when debatehad also been re-ignited by politicians calling for no safe spaces for terrorists",tech
"The report examined whether it is technically and operationally feasible to meet law enforcements call for exceptional access without causing large-scale security vulnerabilities  posing the question of whether itspossible to build in such exceptional access without creating unacceptable risk?Theirconclusion wasclear: exceptional access without unacceptable riskis not possible, they wrote",tech
Yet exactly what those technical capabilities are remains unclear (And vague technical requirements for exceptional access are also raised as aproblem in Keys Under Doormats,tech
"The documentalso sets out that decrypted data must be handed over within a day after a CSP has been served a warrant by a government agency, and that CSPs must maintain the capability to intercept simultaneously comms and metadata for up to 1 in 10,000 of their customersThe technical details of how any encryption perforations couldbe achieved are evidentlyintended to remain under wraps Which meanswider data security riskscannot be publicly assessed",tech
"I suspect that all the vagueness about concrete technical measures is deliberate, because it allows the government to deal with the technical details within a particular technical capability notice, which would be under a gag order, and thus avoid any public scrutiny by the infosec community, arguesMartin Kleppmann, a security researcher at the University of Cambridge who submittedevidence to the parliamentary committees scrutinizing the IP bill last year And who has blogged about how the law risks increasing cyber crimeIts easy to criticize encryption technologies as providing safe spaces for terrorists while forgetting that the exact same technologies are crucial for defence against criminals and hostile powers (not to mention protecting civil liberties), he addsIntelligence agencies dont seem to actually want bulk access to encrypted data, but merely want the capability to intercept specific targets Howeverif a system allows encryption to be selectively circumvented at the command of an intelligence agency, its not really end-to-end encryption in a meaningful sense!One possibility forenabling exceptional access that has sometimes been suggested is a NOBUS: aka a nobody but us backdoor  i",tech
"HoweverKleppmann points out that even if the math itself is solid, it merely takes one person with knowledge of the NOBUSto leak it  and then, as he puts it, all mathematical impossibility goes out of the windowThe only way of making a system secure against adversaries who want to harm us is by designing it such that there are no known flaws or backdoors whatsoever, and by fixing it if any flaws are subsequently discovered, he argues",tech
"Crypto expert Bruce Schneier is also dismissive of notion there might be a third way for authorities tosecurely gain exceptional access Asked by TechCrunch whether there could be any way for the UK government to implement a technical capability without the law effectively removing e2e encryption, his response is very clear No, he says",tech
"Meanwhile, on the vulnerabilityfront,Kleppmann notes that even users of services which haveopen source components  such as WhatsApp, which usesthe respected (and independently security reviewed) Signal Protocol for its encryption system  theres still a requirementfor users to trust the companys servers are doing what they say they are when they hand overkeys Which couldoffer a potential route for a government-mandated backdoor to be slippedin",tech
"With WhatsApp/Signal/iMessage there is the remaining problem that you have to trust their server to give you the correct key for the person you want to communicate with, he says Thus, even if the encryption is perfect, if a government agency can force the server to add the governments special decryption key to your list of device keys, they can still subvert the security of the system People are working on improving the transparency of key servers to reduce this problem, but we still have a long way to goI do believe open source is very helpful here, he adds Its not a silver bullet, but it makes it more difficult to sneak in a backdoor unnoticed",tech
"Previously, UK government ministers have both claimed they donot want to ban end-to-end encryption nor are demanding that backdoorsbe built in digital servicesAlthough theyhave also described the rise of e2e encryption as alarmingWhen interrogated specificallyon the e2e question, the former UK Home Secretary (and now UK Prime Minister)said thatcompanies should take reasonable steps to ensure that they are able to comply with the warrant that has been served on them",tech
"Yet  and you might be spotting a pattern here there has been no definition of what those reasonable steps mightbeTherefore it remains unclear where the UKs legal line willbe drawn on encryptionBackdoors and outlawsIf The Suns story is correct, andUK government-ministers-in-waitingare indeed preparing to demandthe likes of WhatsApp and Applehand overdecrypted messagesthen those reasonable steps would presumably require an entire reworking of their respective security systems",tech
"And if the companiesdont bow to suchdemands what then? Will the UK government move toblock access to WhatsApps e2e encrypted messaging service? Or ban the iPhone, given that Apples iMessages also uses e2e encryption? We just dont know at this point",tech
"A spokesperson for WhatsApp declined to comment when contacted for a response to this storyApples press team did not respond to a request for comment either But the company has a history of strongly defending user privacy  taking to the courts in the US last year to fight the FBIs demand to weaken iOS securityto help facilitate access to a locked iPhone that had been used by a terrorist, for example",tech
"WhatsApp has also had its service blocked multiple times in Brazil after it was taken to court fornothanding over decrypted data to law enforcement authorities Its response? To statein public that itcannot hand over information it doesnot holdHowever, the legal situation in the UK is different owing to the 2016 IP Act  with its troublesome clause about removing electronic protectionAnd while there may be fresh moves afoot in the US tointroduce a decrypt billin the US  such legislation has not yet come to pass Whereasin the UK therelevant law is now framed in such a way as to be possible to interpret that it requires CSPs to deliver up decrypted data on warranted demand",tech
"So its not apparent that there would be any legal route for Apple to try to fight a decryption order for iMessage  should it be handed one by UK government agencies  given the companyhas a substantial presence in the UK (As does Facebook, the parent of WhatsApp)You cant run a company as an outlaw, saysDanvers Baillieu, former lawyer turned COO for a startup after a stint working for VPN firm, HideMyAssIf you change the law and it is [a companys] legal duty to do something they dont really have a leg to stand on Its all very well them saying theyre going to crusade for this and that but they ultimately have to comply with the law",tech
"As a VPN provider we obviously told people to get lost the whole time from other countries because we didnt have a physical presence there and we said we just had to abide by UK law So we were constantly having services taken down in countries like India and Turkey and other places  because the authorities there would then lean on our local server providers, he adds",tech
But we could get away with it because we werent physically there,tech
"And if theyre being leant onto build and test backdoors to afford UK intelligence agencies access to theirsystems we may never know as theres no legal route for them to telltheir users whats happeningPerhaps theyd just remove marketing materials that mention end to end encryption from UK versions of their services  and, much like a warrant canary, wed have to make an inference that a certain service might no longer betrustworthy forUK users from that moment onIt would certainly make for some very bad PR, were a companyto defy the gag order and make it publicly known, says Kleppmann",tech
"Meanwhile, plenty of tech services are of course built and maintained by overseas firms or developerswith little or no presence in the UKWhich raises the question of how the government would respond to that workaround for its plan to acquire decrypted data? And whether it wouldseek to block access to services that offere2e encryption andcannot be legally compelled to build in backdoorsA lawyer we spoke to for this story who did not wish to be identified suggested there may be some overseas providers thatare willing to do something  if they can find a way to do so, and want the comfort of a legal compulsion",tech
"For thoseoverseas providers thatare adamant they will not remove electronic protection when handed a UK warrant, its difficultto say whatthe government might do",tech
"I think ultimately the reputable, multinational companies would comply but then youre always going to have some kid spinning up a service from their bedroom in the middle of nowhere  or you have the latest version of Telegram, or something like that  and then its not going to comply So obviously any sensible criminal or terrorist is not going to use the mainstream ones, saysBaillieu Criminals are generally quite dumb about this sort of stuff",tech

"Founded by Patrick Burns, former product manager at Betterment and Spruces chief executive, and Andrew Weisgall, the chief operating officer at Spruce and former head of data science at Betterment, Spruce is angling to reduce the time to close a real estate deal by improving title insurance assessment and issuanceThat arcane corner of the real estate market can take as much as 4-5 days and costs property buyers and seller up to roughly $4,000, according to a statement from the company",tech
"Its also an incredibly lucrative practice Roughly $15 billion in annual premiums flow to title insurance, and most of that is retained by agents That number doesnt even include another $5 billion in extra fees charged for closing and escrow services",tech
"The guys at Spruce guesstimate that fees to title companies may be the single largest closing cost in buying or refinancing a homehttps://vimeocom/217687814After hearing of countless frustrating experiences from the mires of real estate transactions, we saw a great need to apply those same principles, knowing that doing so could have a big effect, Burns wrote to me in an email",tech

"Heres the problem, as Spruce sees it:The work that goes into establishing that certainty costs money, so you would expect some of the premiums to go towards that However, thats not all that is going ontitle companies are far less efficient than they could be at doing that work The research, processing, escrow and closing that comprise a title companys role in ensuring and insuring that a real estate transaction is legally effective are often extremely manual, paper based processes That means theyre more costly than they need to be, more error prone, subject to increasing amounts of fraud, and provide a slower and more opaque process for borrowers than might otherwise be possibleWhy havent these companies kept up with the times, and applied modern technology to their operations?

"But there is confusion over what a true managed marketplace is Its fairly easy to spot a true managed marketplace if you know what youre looking for Managed marketplaces typically adhere to the following characteristics:A value-added intermediary (the management or service) that provides a superior experience versus more traditional peer-to-peer marketplaces, brick and mortar or even a legacy service providerAn introduction of additional risk into the business model; examples might include pre-purchasing and holding inventory or via investing in services related to the buyer/seller that are an incremental, variable cost before any profits have been realized (money goes out before it comes in)A take-rate (gross margin) that is a significant premium versus other buy/sell options in the market in order to offset the premium service level or risk transfer that has occurred",tech
"Its important to note that many of todays ubiquitous marketplace companies such as Uber, Airbnb, Grubhub and others are lightly managed, by which I mean they invest resources in quality assurance, background checks and verifying reviews But these services are typically a de minimis expense on the companys overall operating cost structure  often even considered as part of the customer (or merchant) acquisition cost  and therefore do not classify as a fully managed serviceFor Airbnb, these light costs might include the costs related to verifying a users home address, or the customer service costs of resolving disputes",tech
"Risk Innovation: Unlike brokerages such as RE/MAX or Century 21, which take zero capital risk on a transaction but collect 3 percent from each of the buy/sell sides of a transaction, Opendoor is buying inventory and holding it on their books",tech
"TheRealReal is a managed marketplace in the luxury consignment space focused on clothing, jewelry, handbags, even art The experience differs from eBay, for example, in that sellers need to provide zero effort other than sending their goods to a TRR warehouse (no photography, no descriptions, no customer interaction) and buyers take comfort in TheRealReals quality and authentication services, which they fully guarantee",tech
"Value-Add Innovation: Rather than having to post online listings and photographs of items, pay for a third-party authentication or even deal with shipping, TheRealReal simply collects an item from a consignor and sends them a check once it sells",tech
"Take-Rate: In order to justify its cost structure, TheRealReal (and other comparable marketplaces) command take-rates of 30 percent, effectively triple what non-managed, peer-to-peer marketplaces charge as a commission to sellersLuxe is a managed marketplace for drivers that reduces all friction associated with parking: finding a lot, searching for a spot, returning to the lot, paying the cashier and waiting to exit Operating as an effective always-on, mobile valet service, drivers are met at their destination by a Luxe agent who takes the keys and parks a drivers car",tech
"Risk Innovation: In order to provide uninterrupted, on-demand service, Luxe is forced to employ numerous valets across each geography in which it operates Irrespective of what these valets are actually paid, it is a considerable human capital cost that Luxe is forced to bear ahead of any realized demand This is in contradistinction to a sharing economy marketplace model such as Airbnb or Uber who are not burdened with human capital costs, but rather pay transactional commissions on any given home-owner or driverTake-Rate: In order to counter-act the considerable human capital expense of staffing valets across a city, Luxe should be forced to charge a material premium compared to average hourly parking rates in a particular city It is therefore quite surprising that they advertise an average of $5/hour for their service, especially when the average hourly rate in NYC, for instance, is $11-15/hour",tech
"The seller fees for this risk-free service? Approximately 9 percent with Beepi versus a $125 fee for eBay motors, or about 125 percent on a $10,000 car, nearly an 800 percent differentialSo with a premium 9 percent take-rate, how did Beepi fail?The best insight into their failure may come from a similar model with considerable success It turns out that the nations largest retailer of used cars is also arguably one of the most recognized managed marketplaces in the world: Carmax Give Carmax 30 minutes to inspect your car and they will buy it, even if youre not purchasing one of theirs, with a no-haggle, take it or leave it offer",tech
"At the end of the day, a managed marketplace model for used cars does work",tech
"But an area of struggle with managed marketplaces is that very few digital managed marketplaces are actually public companies, reducing the visibility into their overall economics and processes  and making it hard to test the assumption that service costs should come down over time",tech
"Yet, that doesnt appear to be borne out by Shutterstocks financials",tech
"The learning from this Shutterstock case study, a company which is now 14 years old, is that its improper to simply assume that the substantial service-related costs that managed marketplaces incur in their early stages will decrease with scale, either through execution or software automation As with any company, there is always room for improvement, but the above analysis of Shutterstock would imply that its nowhere near as easy as flipping a switchTakeawaysManaged marketplaces are a quintessential venture investment, allowing entrepreneurs to recast consumer experiences while leveraging venture capital subsidies to hold much of the risk inherent in these managed models",tech
"From a unit economic perspective, the potential automation of much of the service labor that goes into these platforms could be significant Investors and operators need to remain sensitive that it is ultimately the technology, not heavy services, that will long-term cultivate highly desired business models and margins But, that future automation could also lower the barriers and defensibility of these companies, allowing peer-to-peer players to launch a comparable offering with similar software",tech
"In my mind, the sustaining managed marketplaces will not only re-imagine the experience theyre approaching, but be focused from the outset on building a data moat around their product, thereby ensuring that they remain the platform of choice, even if software innovation begins to level the overall playing field Special thanks to Josh Breinlinger and Rebecca Kaden for their feedback on this article*Chicago Ventures is an investor in SpotHero",tech

"State Governor Greg Abbot will sign the new bill into law on Monday, the same day that both will resume service in the city, as The Texas Tribune reports The bill, offiically HB 100, essentially undoes the rules put in place by Austin municipal regulators, standardizing requirements for ride-hailing operations across the state, and requiring that they have a permit from the state licensing body, which incurs an annual operations fee",tech

"One of the problems publishers face today in making their content more readable on mobile devices is that there are multiple, competingformats available for this purpose Facebook has Instant Articles, Google is spearheading the AMP (Accelerated Mobile Pages) project, and the Apple News Format optimizes content for iOS devices",tech
"The functionality will be made available through an extension to the Facebook Instant Articles SDK,which is found here on Github(Documentation on its usage is on the Facebook for Developers site, here)The idea for the extension came about as part of the Facebook Journalism Project, a program that aims to connect Facebook with media publishers to help inform the companysroadmap forupcoming news features on its site Theprojects other ideas include things like letting publishers offer free trials to their paid subscriptions via Facebook, hackathons with publishers development teams, digest packages that Facebook users can subscribe to, PSAs to promote news literacy across Facebook, tutorials for journalists, and moreHowever, the extensions launch also comes at a time when a number of high-profile publishers have begun to abandon Facebooks format, due to its lack of monetization options",tech
"In April, for example, it was reported that Forbes, Hearst, The New York Times and others have backed out of Instant Articles Other major media organizations including Bloomberg, The WSJ, ESPN, CBS News, NPR, Financial Times, and VICE News have also been holdouts, running little to no content in Facebooks format",tech
"Facebook has tried to stem some of these concerns by tweaking the rules for Instant Articles  allowing them to showmore ads, for example, or by rolling out new features, like call-to-action units in the articles that can promote email sign-ups or request Page Likes",tech
"Now, by tying Facebook Instant Articles to AMP and Apple News, the company hopes that it can lure publishers back to its platform by making it possible to publish to all three major services at once",tech

Researchers from Georgia Institute of Technology have released a full report on a new attack vector that affects Android up to version 7,tech
"The team, Yanick Fratantonio, Chenxiong Qian, Simon Pak Ho Chung, and Wenke Lee, have created proof of concept users of the exploit including a bit of malware that draws an invisible grid over the Android screen that exactly mirrors  and can capture  the onscreen keyboardThe possible attacks include advanced clickjacking, unconstrained keystroke recording, stealthy phishing, the silent installation of a God-mode app (with all permissions enabled), and silent phone unlocking + arbitrary actions (while keeping the screen off), wrote the researchers on a dedicated website They discovered the exploit last August",tech
"From the paper:Cloak & Dagger is a new class of potential attacks affecting Android devices These attacks allow a malicious app to completely control the UI feedback loop and take over the device  without giving the user a chance to notice the malicious activity These attacks only require two permissions that, in case the app is installed from the Play Store, the user does not need to explicitly grant and for which she is not even notified",tech
The easiest way to disable this exploit in Android 71,tech
"Fratantonios advice? The usual: dont install random apps, check the permissions they have (but its tricky: these permissions are treated as special and the user needs to navigate to special menus We added the instructions to the website)As of now, I think these attacks are as powerful as they can get, he said",tech

Now the industry is about to see its first big name move into the space after Kik announced plans to introduce its own cryptocurrency via a token saleMessaging app Kik is particular popular among teens and young people in North America,tech
"Most of the interest around ICOs has centered around it being a process that allows companies to raise money independently of so-called professional investors  such as VC firms  since any individual holding the relevant cryptocurrency can invest However, Kik is emphasizing that, beyond raising capital, it is turning to cryptocurrencies to develop its own ecosystem for digital goods and services",tech
"Thebroader motivation is that it is really hard for independent developers to compete with huge companies, Kik CEO Ted Livingston told TechCrunch in an interviewOn one side, you see digital services, on the other they are being owned and controlled by fewer companies because they are the only ones to monetize at scale using advertising",tech
"Kik CEO Ted LivingstonKinshipKiks proposed coin is called Kin  that is apparently short for Kinship: or family/community  created on top of Ethereuman ERC20 token Kikis in the early stages of drawing up a plan to launch it and integrate it into its app potentially as soon as early the comingsummer Kik didnt say how much it aims to raise, but it plans to release 10 percent of the total coinage in the first saleNext year, Livingston revealed, Kin will open up to third party developers for use where he hopes it will find an audience willing for a different approachOur ultimate vision is for Kik to be one of hundreds or thousands of digital services for Kin, he explained",tech
"Theres a long way to go before this theory can be a working concept Kik is still fleshing out its advisory team and, for now, the company declined to name partners it is working with",tech
"A new kind of ecosystemWhile most people are aware that a token sale (or ICO) is used to generate funds, but what is often less understood is that holders of the coins that are sold gain ownership of the means of production, or indeed the total output of the decentralized system",tech
"Developers would take a percentage of the daily reward in proportion to the number of transactions their service was responsible for, the Kik CEO explainedThiscreates a reward engine, a beautiful network effect, where the bigger the daily reward, the more services come into the ecosystem, which drives up the daily reward and more digital services",tech
"Very quickly this could become a very powerful economic force to bring developers to, Livingston addedIn its announcement,Kik highlighted potential monetization in sticker sales, hosted group chats, and bots Telegram, another chat app, and Facebook both offer payment support for bots, and Livingston himself recently said that adding payment options can help bots reach their potentialBut, those cases aside, this is all very much theoretical at this pointKik is making the first move after it released a whitepaper outlining the plans atkin",tech

"Microservices, that is, breaking larger applications into small parts that communicate over APIs,is increasingly becoming the architectural style of choice for many developers (especially when coupled with containers)",tech
"It can do all of this without requiring anychanges to the actual applications Thats becauseIstio sits at the network level and uses a proxy to intercept all network communication between your microservices At its core, Istiouses the Envoy proxy (which was developed by Lyft) and its built-in service discovery and load balancing tools, among other things",tech
"As monolithic applications are decomposed into microservices, software teams have to worry about the challenges inherent in integrating services in distributed systems: they must account for service discovery, load balancing, fault tolerance, end-to-end monitoring, dynamic routing for feature experimentation, and perhaps most important of all, compliance and security, the Istio team explains Inconsistent attempts at solving these challenges, cobbled together from libraries, scripts and Stack Overflow snippets leads to solutions that vary wildly across languages and runtimes, have poor observability characteristics and can often end up compromising securityA company couldstandardize on a single library for managing the communication between services, butthe team argues that thats unlikely to happen, would leave out existing services and reduce flexibility",tech
"Istio essentially provides developers with a single service mesh that provides the monitoring services to then implement the necessary load balancing, flow-control and security policies they need to keep their applications running even if the network isnt reliable Istio also allows developers to authenticate and secure the communications between different applications using a TLS connection (which means the developer doesnt have to manage certificates, for example)",tech

An impressive new exploit gives hackers the ability to control your desktop through malware spread by fake movie subtitles,tech
"Our research reveals a new possible attack vector, using a completely overlooked technique in which the cyberattack is delivered when movie subtitles are loaded by the users media player These subtitles repositories are, in practice, treated as a trusted source by the user or media player; our research also reveals that those repositories can be manipulated and be made to award the attackers malicious subtitles a high score, which results in those specific subtitles being served to the user This method requires little or no deliberate action on the part of the user, making it all the more dangerous",tech

One of the most obvious places where its partnering now is in logins: G2 Crowd requires users to register themselves via their LinkedIn profiles in order to authenticate themselves and to help control against nefarious reviews of software from competitors and trolls,tech
"LinkedIn doesnt allow cross postingto users profiles, but allows authenticated users to share G2 reviewsontoLinkedIn and have it show up intheir feedG2 Crowd is a highlyrespectedcompanywith great insights into the B2B environment, a spokesperson said",tech
"Companies, as on Glassdoor, get free profiles and they can claim them to add in more information about what they do, downloads and so on The other area where G2 Crowd is hoping to build out its business is in areas of analytics and research  competing against the likes of Forrester, Gartner and IDC for profiles and sector analysis  and also into other adjacent areas of products that businesses might need to buy, be it consulting or integration services, or perhaps even who the best company is to cater an event",tech
"So far the formula has been working Last year, there were 75,000 reviews posted on the site  triple the number from the year before, and this year G2 Crowd projects 225,000 reviews posted on the site",tech
"Another area where G2 is quite compatible with LinkedIn is that both companies tend to have very strong SEO, meaning its results score highly on Google when you are looking things up (in the case of LinkedIn, people like Ingrid Lunden; and in the case of G2, things like LinkedIn competitors)This is a blessing and a curse: a blessing in that it brings a lot of visibility and traffic to the companys services and potentially that will help feed in more reviews and drive more companies to claim and pay for their profiles A curse because that leaves G2 Crowd somewhat at the mercy of Google, its algorithms and its longer-term ambitions of what it might want to do in various specific areas of vertical search",tech

"From battling back bills that would have hamstrung online marketplaces like hometown heroes Etsy, or marshaling the community to speak out against national policies that effect the technology industry, Tech:NYC has taken a leading role in policy discussions in city hall, the Albany statehouse, and as a beacon nationallyThe biggest achievement is that weve been able to create a community, says Wilson",tech
Indeed they have,tech
But the organizations reach extends beyond its sheer numbers,tech
"For Wilson and the executive director Samuels, nothing exemplifies the kind of work that Tech:NYC can and should do more than its response to the Executive Order signed earlier this year that denied entry toimmigrants, refugees (and even US citizens) from several countries from entering the United States without extreme vettingJust getting the local community to stand up against whats happening down in Washington was an achievement, Wilson says",tech
"It was an expression of New York values, says Samuels, and something that the organization will continue to advocate",tech
"Part of that effort is also dependent on policy another area where the Tech:NYC coalition came together to battle for its interests against what it viewed as bad laws coming from AlbanyEarlier this year, the state government floated a proposal for a marketplace tax that would, in essence, place unfair burdens on companies like Amazon, Etsy, and any other ecommerce company looking to do business in New York, according to the Tech:NYC argumentsWith a coordinated effort including education, and a well-placed op-ed in the New York Post, Tech:NYC was able to kill the proposal",tech
"Finally, the organization is pushing an agenda that emphasizes gender and racial diversity in the New York technology industry and looking to encourage that through job training and primary education efforts",tech
"Wilson has been instrumental in encouraging New York City to develop its Computer Science For Allprogram, first instituted by current Mayor Bill de Blasio, and Tech:NYC is picking up the banner and encouraging the governor to expand the program statewide",tech
"Given the current political climate, Wilson said, its important for the technology industry to stand up for its interests and, more importantly, its beliefs",tech
"Given its successes, it looks like the organization is well on its way toensuring that the technology industry is well-represented in the discussions of what a future New York state looks like And since New York is one of the wealthiest and most populous states in the country  its policy decisions can shape the national discussion: Henrik Sorensen/Stone/Getty ImagesCircle Media, the company behind Circle with Disney a device that helps parents enforce their homes internet rules and restrictions  has raised $10 million in Series A funding, the company announced this morning The round was led by early stage venture fundRelay Ventures There was anotherprivate equity investment in the round, but the parties didnt want to be named",tech

TC: ICOs are everywhere suddenly,tech
"TC: The idea isthat instead of raise traditional funding from a bank or investors, a company that sells tokens to its customers ensures thosecustomers are better alignedwith the companys success Is that accurate?SM: Yes If Im buying your token, I am incentivizedto help the companys product and ecosystem expand, bring in other users, maximize the tokens utility, and Im hoping that demand for the token will increase and it may become more valuable",tech
"TC: So how do these ICOswork, practically speaking?SM: Theres a cadence to these things",tech
"TC: How do companies establish a value for the tokens theyre offering?SM: Typically, a company sets out of a goal, then in the sales process, they can either discover what the market is willing to pay, as with a Dutch auction, or they can stipulate the price themselves and explain what the use of the proceeds will be The value of the token lies in its functionality and utilityToken holders are effectively prepaying for a product or service If I run a video game company, for example, I can sell you tokens that represent in-game purchases once the game is built If you know youll buy swords and shields and things like that, you can just pay for them now",tech
"S regulators will crack down on these ICOs?SM: Lawyers are relying on case law that defines what a security is The most well-known case is the Howey Test, created by the Supreme Court for determining whether certain transactions qualify as investment contracts",tech
"SM:The SEC and other regulators are engaged and aware of the developmentsin this market, but theyretaking a measured approach It hasnttaken a view publicly, put out a paper, or taken an enforcement action in the space",tech
"TC: For how much longer, do you think? ICOs are getting tons of attention suddenly, as you knowSM: Were definitely starting to see more and more companies that are outside this core space beginning to examine [this new financing mechanism] But its early days",tech
"TC: What happens when people want to sell the tokens theyve bought?SM: Well, first, you can use them in a companys ecosystem",tech
"TC: Is there any kind of lock-up period, or can a token holder immediately sell that token if he or she wants?SM: There hasnt been a lock-up period traditionally, but over the last two months, a practice has started to develop [toward that end] as transactions are getting larger, because it clearly makes a lot of sense In the case of Storj, some purchasersthat committed early received discounts but were also locked up [from selling] for between 3 and 12 months",tech

"If accurate, the Hexadite acquisition would be one of a series of security acquisitions that Microsoft has made in Israel",tech
"Hexadite is part of what you might call the new guard of security companies, building solutions based on machine learning and AI modelled on top cyber analysts to try to tackle threats more like the smartest humans wouldEssentially what it does is provide a security remediation system: it identifies and stops smaller issues itself, and at the same time it weeds out bigger problems that need to be addressed by in-person security teams By doing this, it prevents those teams from being overwhelmed by the smaller items",tech

Theres a potential for abuse in these kinds of policies which may provide a perverse incentive to governments which could conceivably profit on the back of insurance payouts in the event that a country is adversely affected by an epidemic (not to be too ghoulish about it)Rossi insists that the insurance policies will encourage countries to establish better monitoring and management tools so that they can respond to outbreaks before they become severe global pandemics,tech

"The new Taboola news feed essentially consolidates a number of widgets and links you already have on websites, specifically publishers websites, into a larger feed experience: alongside the links to other articles on your own site, and those of other publications in the Taboola network, you will see cards forother services like the weather, videos, and marketing cards for in-app purchases, sponsored content and more  additions that have in part been made possible by some of Taboolas recent acquisitions like ConvertMedia and Commerce Sciences",tech
"The germination for adding a news feed comes from the fact that Taboola doesnt feel like its set of links are a solution, as much as they are part of an ongoing problem",tech
"Today, when you look at publishers sites, its a shitshow, Adam Singolda, Taboolas founder and CEO, saidin an interview You have the right rail, at the bottom you have Taboola, you have newsletter widgets, and commenting and navigation bars And in mobile its even worse",tech
"In trying to figure out how to solve that problem, Taboola  which is based in New York but was founded in and still operates in Israel  has taken a page from the new guard of cybersecurity companies: the best way to combat a threat today is to put yourself (or your security system) in the mindset of that threatEventhough I have a lot of issues with Facebookthey are doing something well, the news feed, he said Scrolling down you are presentedwith different cards images or posts or links or videos or ads  but its a consistent, ongoing experience",tech
"The ideal, he said, isto get the 1 billion or so people who see and (potentially) click on Taboola links to spend more than 3seconds on a page: to move them to three minutes, and perhaps one day to three hours This is especially relevant in markets where mobile is the primary platform for media consumption and browsing Singolda said that today in the U",tech
"S and Western Europe, about half of the readers across its network are on mobile In parts of Asia, that proportion is 90 percent",tech
"Taboolas news feed is not completely replacing the Taboola gridat this point, but this is Singoldas long-term intention",tech
"Readers using the new feedwill, for now, click out of a publishers page to go to a new page in the browser to read stories, with a small option to click back to the originating page Singolda told me that the idea will be to introduce AMP pages into the mix over time to speed up the jumps, as Taboola is already an AMP partner",tech
"Ill be looking to seehow that plays out, since AMP links currently mean no traffic for the originating or endpoint publications, with Google hosting the speed-up pages on its own URLs Same, too, goes for the idea of bringing in infinite scrolls, which seem to pose their own kinds of unique challenges for publishers that want to keep readers engaged on their own properties, not floating away on an endless river provided by someone elseTaboola has raised over $160 million, and Singolda said that its profitable and has $100 million of that funding still in the bank",tech

"ICO basicsAn ICO is a fundraising tool that trades future cryptocoinsin exchange for cryptocurrencies of immediate, liquid value You give the ICO bitcoin or ethereum, and you get some of Billys New Super Great Coin or the infamous CrunchCoin",tech
"The Financial Timescalls ICOs unregulated issuances of cryptocoins where investors can raise money in bitcoin or other [cryptocurrencies], which is accurate, especially if you underline the word unregulated",tech
"Sticking close to the older financial publications, The Economist also took a look at the financing mechanism, describing what you buy in an ICO in the following fashion:ICO coins are essentially digital coupons, tokens issued on an indelible distributed ledger, or blockchain, of the kind that underpins bitcoin, a crypto-currency That means they can easily be traded, although unlike shares they do not confer ownership rights [] Investors hope that successful projects will cause tokens value to riseThe referencedvalue increase is critical to understanding the appeal of ICOs These are not transactions of love",tech
"After all, why notSo ICOs can be coins on top of coins funded by the transfer of other cryptos to accounts in the hunt for whats next That might sound crazy, but its hot times in the crypto world",tech
"And that heat is keeping ICOs bubbling The same Economist piece, published in April of 2017, notes: [n]early $250m has already been invested in [ICOs], of which $107m alone has flowed in this year, a metric that it attributes to the aforementioned Smith + Crown",tech
"That is a lot of money, making ICOs large in terms of their sheer dollar-scale Its therefore not hard to understand why more traditional business publications are paying attention Following the money is their jam",tech
In short:ICOs are the new funding slingshot by which nascent cryptos are flung into the world,tech

So regulation is out of the mix for now,tech
"There is an argument to be made that a dearth of regulatory oversight is actually good, as it allows the ICO market to iterate and innovate quickly It is a reasonable(ish) argument and likely technically correct, but that doesnt mitigate the potential for unsophisticated investors to be preyed uponCaveat emptor andmoral hazard are fine arguments in favor of no rules regarding ICOs and cryptos, but if the market wants to keep growing, it will need to do more to attract consistently larger pools of capitalBubble me thisIs there a chance that ICOs will slow? Of course, but the forces behind them run a bit deeper than we might have first guessedCryptoHustle makes the related point in a recent article that ICO mania is likely due to early Ethereum adopters making serious returns after the last bull run",tech
"That ICOs would eventually get ahead of themselves and bubble like so many young technology niches was predicted at least since last October How long the good times will last isnt obvious But the correction will come, as always, and when it does, well see which cryptos have a real shot",tech
"Take this awayThe cryptocurrency market is hot once again And while it continues to setnew records, a host of altcoins will demand itsslice of the marketShould you buy into an ICO?

"In the filings, PFM alleges Theranos ran fake demonstrations tests for prospective investors and business partners using commercial devices instead of its one-drop blood testing technologyThe 66-page complaint goes on to accuse founder Elizabeth Holmes and former president and COO Ramesh Sunny Balwani of repeatedly and knowingly lying, That, among other things, the company had developed a proprietary technology that worked; the companys proprietary technology was ready for commercial use to perform nearly all laboratory tests on a few drops of blood drawn from a patients finger; and the company was on the cusp of receiving all necessary regulatory clearances and approvalsThe allegations are based on the testimony of 22 former employees of the company who were deposed by lawyers of PFM and are part of a follow-up suit to the one the firm filed last October alleging Theranos had misledthe hedge fund when it convinced it to add funds to the company coffers in 2014The new filings are a follow-up to another suit PFM filed earlier this month to block a deal Theranos had offered to investors to take equity, including some of founder Elizabeth Holmes sharesif they promised not to suePFM and two other investors now say Theranos has been pressuring them to drop the suit, suggesting they should accept more equity or the company would seek Chapter 11 protection, according to Bloomberg",tech

"Basically, Musk seems to want to achieve a communications leap equivalent in impact to when humans came up with language  this proved an incredibly efficient way to convey thoughts socially at the time, but what Neuralink aims to do is increase that efficiency by multiple factors of magnitude Person-to-person, Musks vision would enable direct uncompressed communication of concepts between people, instead of having to effectively compress your original thought by translating it into language, and then having the other party decompress the package you send them linguistically, which is always a lossy process",tech

"So the question is, why do the prices change so much in the first place? It comes down to supply and demand: Most cryptocurrencies have only a fixed total supply, and yet demand for the coins is uncertain and constantly fluctuating thanks to speculationOf course, its easy enough to talk about the problem  coming up with a solution is quite another matterWhy is stability so important?The need for stability is not unique to cryptocurrency Any currency needs to be stable in order to be used as a trusted medium of exchange The more that prices rise and fall, the more ordinary people will shy away from using the coins for everyday transactions",tech
"Whether they hoard the coins in the hope that prices will rise sharply soon, or they avoid using them altogether for fear that they will lose all of their value, people are not yet accustomed to seeing cryptocurrency as real moneyWorse, the unpredictability of prices wreaks havoc on regular money services, like remittance, currency conversion, and the use of ATMs In order to use cryptocurrencies, businesses have to hedge their risks by charging exorbitant fees",tech
Bitcoin ATMs can charge up to 15 percent just to convert to fiat currency,tech
"Image: JaaakWorks/iStock/Getty ImagesPhase 1: Building a stable ecosystemWhen building a cryptocurrency from scratch, you first need a solid foundation",tech
"Cooperation over competition: A decentralized communityUnited we stand, divided we fallWhat if there was a currency that encouraged people to cooperate? What if people were incentivized by a spirit of growth, rather than of greed? Under the ideal model, a network of cooperative businesses and services would coordinate with each other as a single unit The coin would be shaped democratically by this co-op (shaped not controlled)",tech
"Instead of rampant online speculation, users would visit local exchanges to buy and sell the currency The community as a whole would vote on when to increase the coins price, which would keep things democratic and guard against sharp spikes",tech
Official local exchangesHaving to look other users in the eye can make a world of difference,tech
"Local exchange dominanceThis kind of approach can only work if there are dramatically more local exchanges than online exchanges It would mean that the local exchanges would dictate the pricing of the currencyMarketing early can be disastrousMarketing is a powerful force, and as such it needs to be handled with care",tech
"With speculation, capital infusion is needed to keep the currency stable, which can be a significant task Take Bitcoin for instance: With a market cap of roughly $20 billion, it would need a huge amount of capital to have a stable floorSlow and steady wins the raceCryptocurrencies are still in their infancy, and its hard to tell where the path for most of the major currencies is headed What is the finish line that they are aiming for? What will the end game be? Most cryptocurrencies have little direction besides the whims of the market, so theres no telling where they will end up However, there are a handful of interesting coins that have invested in strategies that nudge them in a specific direction",tech
The central app coin methodThis is a strategy that is centered around creating value with unique products and services that are associated with the currency,tech
"For example, the MaidSafe network incentivizes users to provide something of value to the network (storage space), and offers the use of apps and services in return for coins This naturally leads to better cooperation People want to create value and channel their efforts toward the growth of the currency that they have in common",tech
"The setup and switch methodSimilar to the central app strategy, this method establishes a user base first, and then introduces the currency",tech
"The grassroots movementFinally, the best way for a currency to create that all-important foundation of true users is through bootstrapping",tech
"In other words, FairCoin traded the excitement of volatility and greed for a quiet, long-term stability The only problem is that people might not notice! Drama catches the human eye, after all",tech
"Hard forksLets take a look at the hard fork that looms in the horizon for Bitcoin As if things werent complicated enough, now there could be two competing chains for the currency",tech
"This makes it so that users have very little reason to defect from the existing community A hard fork would mean giving up many benefits of the co-op, so people stay loyal to the original vision of the currency When something deeper than just greed ties a community, hard forks dont occur as often",tech
"ConclusionStable prices dont just happen by accident They are not a miracle of the market  they require a carefully constructed foundation A stable currency needs a stable ecosystem firstWhile its tempting to market the currency too soon because capital injection can do a lot to raise prices in those critical early periods, its better to wait Advertising is like opening up Pandoras box and inviting the world to look inside",tech
"With a truly stable currency, on the other hand, you can have currency conversion, remittance, ATM withdrawals and other financial services with lower fees than fiat systems In other words, it can be used as intended  as money This is what will ultimately attract a mainstream audience and will actually incentivize them to make the switch to cryptocurrencyFeatured Image: Bryce Durbin/TechCrunchAccording to Snaps S-1 filing for its IPO, of the $400 million in revenues the company has, $360 million is made by selling Geofilters, or photo filters based on location, which advertisers can buy So owning the patent on that concept would seem pretty crucial",tech
"But according to sources, serial entrepreneur and investor Moshe Hogeg, who co-founded Mobli, sold Moblis Geofilters patent to Snap this month for $77 million",tech
"However, other Silicon Valley sourcespouredscorn on the idea that Facebook had even been offered the patent, with one source familiar with both companiescommenting that Mobli wasnt on the radar of local power playersA Facebook spokesperson said the company had no comment to make",tech
"Whatever the case, had Facebook secured the patent, it would have destroyed Snaps ability to garner revenues from geo-filters, and thus Snaps main source of incomeTypically patents can cost $10,000 to $300, or up to a million dollars The most expensive in Israel to date was a $27 million patent to do with Google MapsMoblis original patent for Geofilters was approved in 2014, long before Snapchat created the Geofilters feature",tech

"AdvertisementAmazon has quietly introduced a change to its Alexa Skills Developer agreement aimed at further restricting advertisements within Alexas voice apps, which it calls skills Previously, the developer agreement stated that it would ban apps that used the Alexa app home cardsfor ads  the cards that appear in the Alexa companion app  that can describe the skill in question or enhance the voice interaction with details provided as text-based content Now the agreement simply bans skills that contain any advertising for third-party products or services, according to the updated documentation",tech
"Amazon carves out an exception for streaming music, radio and flash briefing apps (news briefings) where advertisements are not the core functionality of the skill But other than that, ads are now largely banned on the Alexa platformThe change has irked someAlexa developers who already feel that its too difficult to make money from their Alexa skills, as is",tech
"While Amazon isfollowing an ambitious path toward making its voice computing technology powerful and ubiquitous  including by opening access to Echo speaker technology, Alexas voice technology, and the underlying technologies that power Alexas abilities to understand language  it has yet to fully address the needs of developers who want to build their own app businesses on top of its voice computing platformIn fact, this problem is so often discussed that theres an inside joke inan active Slack community for Alexa developers that involves the posting of a snow cone emoji The joke is that its easier to make more money selling snow cones than building Alexa skills",tech
"There was initially some speculation that the change was made in response to technology being developed by VoiceLabs, which has been testing an advertising platform aimed at Alexa Skill developers involving Sponsored Messages,as referenced here in a blog post These will allow developers to insert brief ads, similar to those in podcasts, but which are interactive",tech
"VoiceLabs systemallows partner advertisers to connect with consumers who useAlexas voice-powered apps But because any one Skill wouldnt have enough users to capture that ad spend, VoiceLabs system instead combines usersacross Skills This aggregated audience is then sizable enough to gain advertisers attention and interest",tech
"ButVoiceLabs co-founder and CEO Adam Marchick disputes the idea itshis system thats at all related to the policy change He says that Amazon has known about Sponsored Messages since January, and has been collaborating with VoiceLabs on its development",tech
"In addition, of the 1,300 developers on VoiceLabs platform, the majority of those planning to use Sponsored Messages are creating flash briefings, which are not affected by the new policy",tech
"Amazon has a really hard job, says Marchick",tech
Websitehttp://wwwamazon,tech
"Those examples are the same sort of advertisements that Amazons policy change are meant to head off, necessarily But it does allow the company to summarily reject apps that are designed to use advertising in unwelcome ways  those that would ultimately annoy Alexas users, and decrease interest in voice computing in general",tech

"While thats an obvious boon for homeowners, the dynamic pricing system can leave inventory open when other sites are booked full, which is a plus for guests who might book last-minute With on-the-ground staff to maintain the homes it manages, Vacasa also can integrate qualitative local information in a way the competition often cant We give our on-the-ground staff a series of tools to help them convey hey theres this event coming or hey theres this spike in demand coming,' product lead Travis Green explains",tech
"Most vacation rental systems price a listing by inching it a tiny bit lower than whatever else is available, which means that per-night prices are primarily decided in relation to one another rather than in relation to external factors Of course, Vacasas own recipe isnt the only show in town  third parties have been offering Airbnb pricing engines for at least a few years now",tech
"For smaller property management companies and homeowners with vacation rental properties, Vacasa makes for an attractive partner Its yield management math is a big part of that, and the company claims that in 2016 it offered homeowners 34 percent more in rental income than similar pricing systems by competitorsFor now, Vacasa intends to keep its formula in-house The core of our model is to keep our systems proprietary, Breon said He calls the new pricing systema requirement for Vacasas next stage of growth, noting the companys ambitious but still slow-and-steady five-year goal to be everywhere where people own second homes",tech

"Featured Image: NicoElNino/Getty ImagesTesla is issuing a voluntary recall for Model S and Model X vehicles made between February 2016 and October 2016, for a potential manufacturing issue in which the parking brake,once engaged, might experience a fractured internal gear that results in itbeing stuck in the on positionTesla stresses that this recall is being done only because the carmaker typically exercises an abundance of caution in these cases, and that only a small number of vehicles will likely ever exhibit the issue, and that even when they do, the resulting problems dont present a safety risk to either drivers or passengers",tech
"The problem came to light because Tesla found customers were getting alerts that said their parking brake needs service, or that the brake could not be disengaged, not in huge numbers but with noteworthy frequency",tech
"Tesla will be filing the recall with NHTSA, and expects to have all parts needed to make the swap by October of this year The process takes less than 45 minutes to replace both of the parts on each brake on the vehicle, but because of availability of replacement parts, the carmaker will be starting the recall process now and complete a total recall by October, assuming all 53,000 vehicles affected come back for service",tech
"Heres the full email being sent out to Tesla customers this morning describing the problem, and the steps owners can take to get it fixed:Tesla recently discovered a potential manufacturing issue with the electric parking brakes installed on certain Model S and Model X vehicles that could prevent the parking brake from releasing We do not believe this issue could ever lead to a safety concern for our customers, and we have not seen a single accident or injury relating to it However, in order to be overly cautious, we are going to be proactively replacing these parts to ensure that no issues ariseSpecifically, we have determined that the electric parking brakes installed on Model S and Model X vehicles built between February and October 2016 may contain a small gear that could have been manufactured improperly by our thirdparty supplier If this gear were to break, the parking brake would continue to keep the car from moving, but the parking brake would then be stuck in place",tech

"Those who are particularly bullish about the future of automation point to past technology breakthroughs like the industrial revolution, which didnt so much kill jobs as shift the economy away from things like agriculture What that means, ultimately, is that short term job loss can give way to long term job growth, as new and potentially better jobs are created And certainly one thing automation and robots have the potential to do is help eliminate what the industry has handily deemed the three Ds  dull, dirty and dangerous jobs",tech
"But among these polarizing conversations around the growth of technology in the industrial setting, an important point often gets lost: if left unchecked, it can serve to expand the already vast economic gulf between what have been deemed skilled and unskilled workforces MIT economist David Autor summed the fear up well in a conversation we had earlier this year",tech

"The streaming music platform now hasa new deal with Merlin, the biggest digital rights agency representing independent music labels  a fragmented but ultimately large group that accounts for 12 percent of the recorded music market with 20,000 labels (and covering hundreds of thousands of artists as diverse as Dizzee Rascal, Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, and Prince), and distributors in 51 countriesWeve reached out both to Merlin and Spotify to see if they can provide specifics of what the new deal will entail and will update this post as we learn more, although Merlin has already said that it would not be commenting on the commercial terms From what weve heard from a source close to the negotiations, Merlin has been able to get terms that are competitive with those of the largest labels",tech
"As a couple of points of reference further to that: Earlier this month, Spotify inked a new deal with Universal Music, which saw the label accept a lower royalty payment per-play from Spotify (meaning more kept by the streaming company), but also gained some ground in windowing, where songs will not be available in Spotifys free tier, and only its paid tier, in the first two weeks of the release",tech
"Im delighted that Merlin has reached this new agreement with Spotify, addedMartin Mills, Merlin chairman",tech
"Many of Spotifys earliest adopters were consumers who sought out independent music on the platform, and as such Merlins association with the company goes back a long way: Merlin was a launch partner of Spotifys in 2008 and today covers deals withlabels like Armada Music, Beggars Group, Domino, Entertainment One, Epitaph/Anti, Hopeless Records, Kobalt Music Recordings, Mad Decent, Naxos, [PIAS], Secretly Group, Sub Pop and WarpIndie music has been a huge part of our success since day one & I am super happy to say we have a new, multi-year deal w/ @merlinnetwork  Daniel Ek (@eldsjal) April 20, 2017Today, Spotify has 50 million paying users, a big emphasis on playlists, and is aiming a much bigger, mainstream market Partly because of this, Merlin today isthe fourth-largest label partner on Spotify  although this is still significant in that there are many smaller and independent groups that are still negotiating with Spotify below it",tech
"This is what led the company to renegotiating its deals with labels, at a time when Spotify has realised that it has significantly more leverage now because of its size as the worlds biggest streaming music companyWhile Pandora is now moving ahead with its own Premium tiers and (finally) some more international growth, and Apple is pushing hard on its own music product, Spotify has not been standing still Just this week the companyexpanded its half-price student tier to 33 countries, and it relaunched its artists portal to improve services that creatives and their managers can use to market their music, interact with fans, viewanalytics abouthow their tracks are being consumed and more",tech
"Prior to the renegotiations, Spotify was workingon a rough70-72 percent payout as has been reported beforeand outlined a few years ago by Spotify itself (apast link to Spotifys own explanation is now dead)Essentially, about 55 percent is paid to record labels and artists; and 15 percent or more goes to music publishers and songwritersThe company says it has paid out over $5 billion to rights holders since launchingMerlin, meanwhile, also licenses to SoundCloud, YouTube Red, Spotify, Pandora, Google Play, Deezer, Vevo and KKBOX in AsiaAt the Shanghai Auto Show on this week, global automotive supplier Harman announced a new partnership with Baidu, the leading Chinese internet services provider",tech

"In an interview with Vice News, Lisa Jackson, Apples vice president of environmental, policy and social initiatives, said were actually doing something that we rarely do, which is announce a goal before weve completely figured out how to do it So were a little nervous, but we also think its really important, because as a sector, we believe its where technology should be going",tech
"Using only recycled materials not only reduces environmental impact, but also helpsprevent human rights abuses, such as the use of child labor to mine cobalt, which is essential for lithium-ion batteries, and minerals from conflict zones (Apple recently stopped buying cobalt mined in Congo and audited its supply chain)",tech
"Other mined materials used in Apple products include aluminum, copper, tin and tungsten In its Environmental Responsibility Report, Apple said to start, were encouraging more customers to recycle their old devices through Apple Renew",tech
"For many smartphone users, however, a sticking point is that Apple products, including iPhones, have a reputation for being harder to repair than devices from other manufacturers Greenpeace called the company out on this issue, saying that while transitioning to 100 percent recycled materials is critical to reducing the sectors footprint, it is also fundamental for Apple and other major IT companies to design products that last, are easy to repair and recyclable at the end of lifeJackson told Vice News that a lot of people buy Apple products because they know they do last But as the publication points out, electrical appliances in general have shorter lifespans than they did just a decade ago and that Apple itself says iPhones and Apple Watches are only supposed to last three years though the same report also notes that most of those products last a lot longer than three years and continue to get updates beyond that timeStill, Apples promise is a step in the right direction, even if the company still doesnt know how exactly it will come to fruition",tech

"If Google offers its own ad blocker in Chrome, targeting specific types of ads that users find particularly annoying, like pop-overs and autoplaying audio and video, those usersmight never seek out a third-party ad-blocking extension, the logic goes The WSJ reports that Google doesnt love the deals it often has to make with third-party blockers like Adblock Plus, which require payment of fees in some cases to whitelist ads by companies like Google who are willing to pay for the privilege of working around their filtersChromes widespread uptake by internet users means the browser has almost half of the market when it comes to navigating the web, so putting an ad blocker natively within Chrome and turning it on by default would basically stop cold the growth of third-party options: Users wont actively seek out a way to block ads during their web-browsing sessions if the ads are already blocked to begin with",tech
"Its a plan thats sort of akin to operating for years with very thin margins or at a loss to block out the competition, almost the way Amazon approached e-commerce Google wouldnt be aiming to eliminate advertising altogether, but a side-benefit for consumers might be the institution of moreuser-friendly acceptability standards for ads  if you turn off your ad blocker for a second, youll find its gotten pretty bad out there",tech

"Still, fans of Big Blue can take heart in that its strategic imperatives businesses (around which IBM began restructuring in 2015) are beginning to show some growthRevenue at that business segment increased 12 percent to $7",tech
"Where the hurt happenedLosses were mainly in the legacy businesses, like consulting and sales from hardware and infrastructure equipment (to be expected, as the cloud computing business essentially cannibalizes hardware sales)And, IBM also spent a bit more on research and development in the last quarter, with that number ticking up to $1",tech
"IBMs R&D department was famous for decades for churning out impressive technologies, and the Beast from Armonk (no one actually calls it that) needs to reclaim some of that mantle if its going to continue to compete with the Microsofts, Googles and Amazons of the world  let alone the Huaweis and AlibabasIBM isnt new to makeovers",tech
"What the Street wantsAll of this comes as analysts are looking hard at the restructuring Rometty began two years ago According to a Barrons report, one of the big sources of concern for analysts was the companys gross profit margin",tech
So gross margins are putting pressure on a business that needs to start showing real revenue growth if its to remain competitiveIBM cant rely on stock buybacks and other financial shenanigans to inflate the stock price and make itself appealing to investors,tech

Forestry practices need to be scaled up to deal with the problem,tech

"Turning all this into a simple, free SDK (not requiring $15-33!) inside an app which does not spam the user and allows them to tailor the experience would utterly disrupt how this technology could be applied and literally set it free from physical beaconsImagine seeing monitors and screens that are already on the walls of airports and malls come to life for you with relevant information (gate and time, or special offers based on your personal preferences) or an experience like Amazon gives you, but in the real, physical world, just like in Minority Report But this time it doesnt use cameras or biometrics, or reading your iris and you can opt out of any experience before, during or after within the applications which contain NewAers SDK",tech

"For Microsoft, the last year or so has been all about infusing its various products with intelligence Those smarts may come in the form of advanced analytics or deeplearning, but the main point here is that the company believes these techniques can solve major pain points for its customers, whether they are PowerPoint users or SQL Server admins Today, at its Data Amp event, the company is launching a number of updates that make it easier for developers who use Microsofts tools to bring intelligence to their own apps",tech
"At todays event, Microsoft islaunching updates to the preview of SQL Server 2017 (technically, this is the Community Technology Preview 20), which will likely become generally availablelater this year (no surprise, givenits name), as well as its Cognitive Services SQL Server 2017, its worth noting, is also the first version to run on Linux and in Docker containers",tech
"As Microsofts Rohan Kumar, the companys general manager for database systems, told me, the basics of database management have essentially been commoditized nowWhat users are looking for now is better ways to get value out of the data they are storing",tech
"So with todays update, Microsoft announced that it is building support for Python right into SQL Server 2017 That may sound like a minor thing at first, but the vast majority of machine learning frameworks rely on PythonMaking it easier to access Python scripts right from the database means its also easier to use machine learning techniques on this data instead of having to first move it out of the database, let it go stale and thentry to build machine learning models on it",tech
"Indeed, its this idea of bringing data and AI closer together thats driving many of these decisions As Joseph Sirosh, Microsofts corporate vice president for its Data Group, noted during a small press event in Seattle earlier this month, intelligence should reside right next to the data It should reside in databases It should reside in applications that generate data So bringing intelligence to our data platforms is an incredibly important part of our strategy",tech
The advantage ofbringing the intelligence closer to the data is pretty obvious in that you can run applications much faster when theres less latency involved  and thats especially true given that the data sets used for machine learning tend to be extremely large,tech
"Besides the added support for Python, Microsoft also is improving its existing support for R  a language thats extremely popular with data scientists  in SQL Server 2017 And as part of this, the company is adding pre-trained neural networks for sentiment analysis and image featurization right into R ServerTo make SQL Server 2017 more useful for more applications, the company also is addingnew features for working with graph datato its database This, the company says, will make it easier for developers to represent the hierarchies and relationships that already typically exist in these relational databases without having to go to a specialized third-party graph databaseMicrosoftCognitive Services, which makes pre-packaged machine learning models available to developers, also is getting an update today",tech

"InSilicon Vally peoplelove to talk about running Docker andKubernetes, and that is the future of the enterprise stack maybe 15 years fromnow, but the reality today is that weve got security concerns and an ITteam that is not ready to make that migration, saidElNaggarThe cost required to migrate is so abhorrent and risky thatif they can find a way to get more value out of systems tat have been depreciated to zero on balance sheet, if they have a way of triple productivity on an asset that is sitting with zero dollars on balance sheet, then thats what they will do Plus, theres tens of billions in revenue still running on top of AS/400s",tech

"At its F8 developer conference, Facebook today announced that it is open-sourcing Litho, a declarative framework for building efficient user interfaces on Android Litho is the same framework Facebook uses internally to build its own Android app, which is currently being used by more than a billion people every month",tech
"The company first talked about this new framework last October At the time, the company noted that the issue it was trying to solve was mostly about building a more performant framework for displaying the Facebook News Feed, which tends to be more complex than the scrollable lists for which the standard Android tools are optimized Those lists tend to use Androids RecyclerView, but in order to get to the 60 frames per second that modern device screens now typically support (and which users expect), the RecyclerView simply isnt fast enough for more complex applicationsAs UIs become increasingly sophisticated, it gets harder to complete all the rendering work that needs to get done in this time frame, Facebooks Pasquale Anatriello and Marco Cova write in todays announcement This proves to be especially challenging with dynamic scrolling surfaces, as new pieces of UI are constantly being introduced on screen",tech
"Lithos programmers used some of what Facebook learned from React and built a new system that improves scroll performance up to 35 percent It does that, in part, by breaking down complex views like the News Feed into smaller components (think text, images and videos) that can then be rendered incrementally It also can take some of those smaller pieces and recycle them without having to keep multiple copies in memory",tech
"As Facebook engineering manager Lucas Rocha and Facebook engineer Emil Sjolander told me earlier this week, its worth noting that while this focus on feeds may solve Facebooks problems (but isnt really applicable to other apps), many of the most popular apps today are indeed built around the idea of a feed Now that its open source, other developers outside of Facebook may also be able to implement some of the idea here for other problems, but the team itself is mostly focused on optimizing the product for the use cases Facebook itself seesLitho is now available on GitHub Facebook is also making a number of tutorials and technical deep dives available on the projects homepageAt its F8 developer conference, Facebook today announced the launch of React VR, a new JavaScript framework that lets developers build virtual reality experiences with the help ofJavaScript",tech
"Even more so than mobile apps, VR apps need to be rendered at 60 frames per second (or, ideally, even faster)",tech
"In addition, it is also launching a rewrite of Relay, its framework for building data-heavy applicationsReact FiberThe idea behind React Fiber, the company tells me, is to take what the company has learned from developing React the first time around and put that into an updated framework that is still fully backwards compatible with existing React-based applications React Fiber, Facebook tells me, will become the foundation of any future improvements and feature development ofthe React framework",tech
"The main focus here was to make React as responsive as possible, Facebook engineer  and member of the React core team  Ben Alperttold mein an interview earlier this week When we develop React, were always looking to see how we can help developers build high-quality apps quicker, he noted We want to make it easier to make apps that perform very well and make them responsive",tech
"In light of this theme, its no surprise that the highlights of this new release are built-in primitives for scheduling and incremental rendering We want to make sure we render the right stuff at the right time, Alpertsaid, and added that responsiveness was a huge push here",tech
"But why rewrite React from scratch? It was not necessarily that the old code base was bad, but we wanted to start with a new foundation that could power everything we do going forward, Alpert said",tech
"Alpert stressed that React Fiber will be backward compatible, though as with all major React updates, there will be a few small breaking changes The team says it doesnt anticipate that these will be problematic for developers, though We always had a strong API contract, so that gives us the flexibility to reimplement, he addedRelay ModernAs Facebook also today announced, Relay  the companys JavaScript framework for building data-driven applications has also been rewritten with a similar emphasis on performance and extensibility Relay combines React with Facebooks GraphQL query language and now Relay Modern, as the company calls this rewrite, is meant to push this concept further and overcome some of the limitations of the original design",tech
"For developers who are already using an older version of Relay, Relay Modern comes with a compatibility APIFacebook says that when its teams switched the Marketplace tab in the Facebook app from Relay to Relay Modern, the time to interaction on Android improved by an average of 900ms While that doesnt sound like much, every second on mobile counts, and thats enough to make an application feel noticeably moreresponsive than before",tech

Facebook Spaces launches in beta today on Oculus Rift + Touch The product is a first taste of Facebooks ambitions to bring social interaction into 3D virtual spaces,tech

"AdvertisementI guess Im not that worried about that, Mark Zuckerberg said in response to criticism about Facebook copying Snapchat He defended the misunderstood strategy as laying groundwork for Facebooks new Camera Effects Platform for developers that launched todayThe first chapter that made sense was to release products that people were familiar with ",tech
"But the thing is, you try to chunk up your releases into specific things along the way And even though were going to talk about it at F8, were not going to release it all at once even though this is kind of the next chapter And the first chapter that made sense was to release products that people were familiar with and to kind of stabilize the product before you try to build a platform on top of that, right? Its really tough to build the product and the platform at the same timeSo I think internally, we just understood where we were going Well roll out the different pieces at different times, but that was partially why were rolling all the stuff out quickly as we build a bunch of infrastructure to be able to do all that",tech
"Essentially, adding to Facebooks various apps an in-app camera with basic augmented reality effects was just the start of a larger platform play",tech

"Developers could make informational tools like overlaid suggestionsfrom experts on businesses, interactive games and mind-bending art that Zuckerberg says would be impossible to create in the real world Meanwhile, users will be able to add augmented reality notes to different specific locations, so they could tell friends their favorite dish at a restaurant",tech
"Anyone can use the simple Frame Studio to upload static camera effectsDevelopers can user three inputs to trigger their augmented reality effects: Face Tracker (but not identity or facial recognition), Sensor data, such as the gyroscope and location, and Scripting APIs to pull in data from other apps and respond to user inputs in real time",tech
"Facebook Lives new augmented reality effects can be built with the Camera Effects Platforms AR Studio toolZuckerbergs vision of an AR worldFor now, Zuckerberg says that at Facebook, we definitely see ourselves as more on the software and services side Luckily, the next phase of AR on camera phones wont require special hardware We dont need to build the phones because the phones are already there Yet he admits,In the beginning of any platform, the hardware and software are not separable, so when AR glasses technology comes of age, Facebook might end up making its ownAt that point, Zuckerbergs grand vision sees augmented reality as an economic equalizer",tech

"After all, recent plays by Amazon, Apple and Google have all demonstrated that smart assistants are the gateway to a lot more than just the weather and silly Wikipedia questions",tech
"Its clear that Samsung is hanging a lot on the software It even went so far as devoting a full buttonto Bixby, even as it made a big show of ditching the big home keyup front But an essential part of adoption requires a strong user experience right out of the gate, and in its present form, Bixby doesnt deliver on the blustery promises the company made ahead of launch, when it promised it would be revolutionizing phone interfaces",tech
"Samsungs acknowledgement of its failure to ship Bixby at press time was less an admission of failure than it was an opportunity for the company to talk up the pieces that are shipping with the phoneWith its intelligent interface and contextual awareness, Bixby will make your phone more helpful by assisting in completing tasks, telling you what youre looking at, learning your routine and remembering what you need to do, it said in a statement sent to TechCrunch following the news Key features of Bixby, including Vision, Home and Reminder, will be available with the global launch of the Samsung Galaxy S8 on April 21",tech
"In its current state, Bixby consists of Home, the bit that pops up when you hit the side button; Vision, an image and text scanning service; and Reminder, which, well, lets you create remindersThis early iteration of Home doesnt do all that much to set itself apart from myriad other content aggregating mobile services Vision, meanwhile, is the most promising piece of the offering, adding a shopping feature along the lines of Amazon Flow, which lets users buy things by scanning a label or barcode",tech

"Fieldscanner doesnt interrupt normal data gathering by drones Users can still upload, store and analyze all the high-res data that they normally would while engaging the new featureMillin, who co-founded DroneDeploy with Mike Winn and Nicholas Pilkington in 2013, explained that the ability to generate maps right away should help users in areas lacking reliable cellular and internet services But it also makes drones more helpful in scenarios that require fast decision-makingFor example, crews sent to evaluate a flooded dam could use drones with Fieldscanner to figure out where to send repair resources first, while theyre still on-site",tech
"Newer dronesand mobile devices, which have strong communication links, precise GPS, and better compute capacity than previous generations, made it possible for DroneDeploy to begin offering real-time maps in the field, Millin said, especially DJIs Mavic and Phantom 4 Pro",tech
"Our mission has always been to make drones accessible and a great tool for productivity Taking processing we used to do exclusively in the cloud and doing this at a slightly lower resolution in the field, reduces time requirements so you can have data instantly accessible",tech

"Featured Image: DroneDeployFlipboard is following the launch of its smart magazines by boosting the role of videosIts not that videos were totally absent from the news app before this, but they usually showed up as an accompaniment to articles  not exactlyprominent placement when compared to the beautiful treatment that Flipboard would often give photosNow, CEO Mike McCue said videos are going to be a native part of the app, which means youll see standalone videos starting to show up in the smart magazines (which offer a personalized collection of stories around topics like cooking or photography) and elsewhere Publishers can also connect related videos together into storyboards, allowing viewers to swipe from one video to anotherThe new video formats will start appearing in Flipboards technology, news and lifestyle/entertainment categories",tech
He added that its not a coincidence that Flipboard is rolling this out so soon after launching smart magazines,tech

"Tumblr today is launching a new app, calledCabana, which allows a group of friends to video chat and watch videos together, in real time The app is being introduced under the Tumblr brand, and will cater to the type of users who frequent Tumblrs blogging service  teensand young adults  but its not currently designed to interoperate with Tumblrs product or take advantage of the existing relationships between fellow Tumblr usersInstead, Cabana came about more through happenstance than strategic direction",tech
"Tumblr founder and CEO David Karp ran into Jason Lee, Director of Product Management at Polyvore Labs, at a Yahoo leadership offsite earlier this year, where Lee was demonstrating the productPolyvore Labs is an internal incubator inside Yahoo  the company that acquired both Tumblr and the fashion site Polyvore in years past",tech
That same sort of thing also happens on Tumblr to some extent  people find interesting content and share it with others,tech
"However, the difference between the two products is that Tumblr is essentially a network of strangers who shareyour interests  perhaps in anime, or art, or some TV show fandom  but Cabana is meant to be used with a group of real-life friendsIf this sort of co-watching experiencesounds familiar, its because theres quite a bit ofaction in this space alreadyThe recently funded iMessage-based videochat app Fam has plans to move into the area of group video viewing, but there are existing apps from otherswho are doing this as well We recently covered one of those efforts called Lets Watch It!, an app for watching YouTube or Twitch videos with friendsBut truthfully, there are a slew of services for group video viewing, including Gaze, MyCircleTV, ShareTube, Togethr TV, Rabbit, Rave, and many, many more",tech
"So the question is not really whether co-watching is going to be a thing  its a thing  but, rather its who will win thisthing if this is athing that isto be wonHow Cabana WorksIn Cabana, up to six friends can hang out in a room in the app, where they share videos from YouTube that they watch together, in real-time and in sync",tech
"In Cabana, we try to blend the experience of hanging out and watching, says Lee We keep your face front-and-center along with the video",tech
"A new home for brands adsYouTubes videos are available through an API integration in Cabana, not an official partnership, to be clearBut assuming this proves popular, Cabana could expand to include videos from other social sources in the future",tech
"Karp sees a path for this, having taken a similar position with regard to live video on Tumblr The company had originallyconsidered building out its own video platform and publishing tools,but later decided it made more sense to work with partners, like YouTube, YouNow, and others when it came time to move into the live video space itself Cabana could eventually do the same",tech
"Theres also overlap with Tumblr when it comes to brand advertisements, Karp believes The brands currently advertising on Tumblr may want to reach a similar, young demographic  those aged 13 through 18  through the Cabana app",tech
"But there is not advertising in Cabana at launch, nor a definitive plan as tohow it would be integrated in the future",tech
"While Cabanais the first standalone social app to emerge from Tumblr, its not the first time Tumblr has tried to branch out into other mobile appsBack in 2012, it launched Photoset, a separate app for posting photos to the social web, including Tumblr (This app was later shut down",tech
S,tech
"The issue for Tumblr is that the way users are connecting today on mobile is changing  were more likely to message and chat, than share blog posts",tech
"Cabana is initially available on iOS with an Android launch planned for MayAs reported earlier this month, Google today has unveiled its new vision for Google Earth, thesoftware that combines satellite imagery, topographic maps and 3D cities, to help you better visualize the planet",tech

"While thisfeature is interesting in and of itself, it could also appeal to those who are looking for travel inspiration and dont have a set place in mind theyd like to visit That would give Google Earth a more practical position in Googles lineup of products potentially tying it into other travel-related products, likeits personalized travel planner, Google Trips, its online trip planning feature on the web, Google Destinations, or its airfare booking tool, Google FlightsAnother new feature is a 3D button that lets you view a placefrom any angle",tech

"Snap notably doesnt use augmented reality or AR once in its blog post announcing the news, preferring instead to talk about how users can paint the world with 3D experiences The intro video, however, will reveal something pretty familiar to anyone who bought into the early hype of the Nintendo 3DS, which came with AR cards that let you place and virtually interact with 3D graphics that looked like they were anchored to, and blended with, the real world",tech
"Based on the demo videos Snap provided, this is a much more impressive incarnation of AR, however, that requires neither QR codes nor other kludgy markers to anchor and generate the graphics you see applied to whatevers captured via your camera lens in real time The gifs below should provide some sense that whats happening here goes beyond the timid stumblings of the very first smartphone and portable console AR productsThe should be fairly easy to use  Snap says you just tap the screen while using the rear-facing camera to cycle through available World Lenses, and it adds that these will be updated on a daily basis, tooThis genuinely sounds like a fun, worthwhile addition to Snapchat that builds on the popularity of its previous Lenses launches But we knew they were coming, and weve actually known for a while now: Its highly likely that Snaps competitors are aware, too, and its probably only a matter of time before they clone this feature the way they have previous tech, too",tech

There are also some more unique features  like Q&A sessions and contests to win player memorabilia and unique experiences with players,tech
"Since the app isbeing deployed by the MLBPA, literally every player in the league has an interest (both professionally, and potentially financially) in seeing that this takes off",tech

Word of mouth is a top driver of popularity for any product Facebooks social by design philosophy sought to give each app its own voice users could speak through to rally their friends to enhance their collective experience,tech

"Within a few months, 7,000 apps had been built on the Facebook Platform That number would grow to 33,000 in a year",tech
"In 2008, Facebook opened the second wing of its Platform, Facebook Connect, which let third-party websites, from news publishers to utilities, offer Facebook login, personalization and instant sharing to the News Feed Facebook effectively colonized the web, giving its citizens easy access abroad while funneling content back to the motherland",tech

"Playing the long gameClearly Facebook is still grappling with how to give developers enough support that they join its Platforms but not so much that they disrupt the networks equilibrium Where its succeeded is internalizing one thing it got wrong 10 years ago: As long as you dont drive the users away, you always get another chanceNews articles were kept from overshadowing personal updates, and now publishers still see a massive chunk of referral traffic from the News Feed Facebook dumped HTML5, but now is spinning up new games platforms within Messenger and a new Steam-like desktop app Open Graph auto-sharing fizzled, but Facebooks Account Kit has flourished by allowing any app to use phone numbers and SMS for sign-up",tech

"The purchase of land doesnt mean Google is breaking ground on a new data center immediately; the report says there arent any plans in the books to start construction right away But with increasing emphasis on its cloud-based business, its unlikely the company will sit idle on plans to build new data center infrastructure for longMore interesting might be the WSJs assertion that several people suggested Google might use the site as a future testing facility for Waymos autonomous vehicles",tech

"Whenever you watch a video, post a picture, or send a message, the bytes that make up that item are analyzed and tallied by your internet provider Once enough of them pile up, youve reached your data cap  annoying, right?But what if some of those data-heavy apps and services just didnt count towards that cap? Thats whats called zero rating, and while it sounds good in theory, its rather problematic in practice",tech
"On a technical level, zero rating is a pretty simple process The packets of data that go to and fro on the internet (wireless and wired) are all labeled with their origins and destinations; thats how the routers and switches know where to send them, or who to notify if they didnt get thereAll an internet provider needs to do is write a bit of code that notes when a packet is going to or coming from a certain place on the internet for example, a range of IP addresses designating a service like YouTube It treats those packets the same as any others and sends them on their way, only once thats done, it doesnt enter them into the official ledger saying how much data youve used Those packets are on the house",tech
"Sure enough, Binge On and its zero rating ilk have proven popular  though it helped that every subscriber was opted into it  and no doubt people have avoided overage fees through Binge On and its equivalents on other carriers and providersBut when things sound too good to be true, they usually are",tech
"Or, maybe the company isnt completely honest about how the system works",tech
Those are ways that malicious or incautious use of zero rating can be anticompetitive,tech
"Highly illogicalOn top of all that, it is worth noting that the whole zero-rating model is based on a lightly camouflaged logical fallacy that carriers are counting on consumers not to spot Think about it:If high-traffic activities like video streaming can be offered for free and without counting towards caps, then networks must have more than enough bandwidth to handle itIf networks have enough bandwidth to handle it, then theres no need for data capsIf theres no need for data caps, then theres no reason to zero-rate anything!It turns out that the entire concept of zero rating contradicts the notion that data caps were necessary in the first place Bandwidth isnt unlimited, but clearly theres enough that carriers dont need to charge for using enormous amounts of it  you can stream ten times your cap amount via zero-rated services and they wont say a thing",tech
"For now, zero rating is mostly limited to programs that you can opt in and out of But the FCC, which is largely responsible for determining the legality of these things, recently made it clear that it wont be looking into existing or future zero rating schemes  unless, one hopes, theyre really egregious",tech

"Earlier this year an agreement was reached on ending geoblocks on travelers digital subscriptions by 2018 And EU consumers are set to say adios to mobile roaming fees from this June So far, so good, you couldsayButwhen theEuropean Commissions draft proposals for digital copyright reform were published last September, they werecriticized by tech companies as regressive,and by copyright reformists as a missed opportunity to modernize ill-fittinglawsto make themfit for purpose in the internet ageThere have also beenwarnings of thepotential impact on startupsof the copyright reform, although its fair to say that the loudest complaints arecoming from big U",tech
"S tech companies that appear to be coretargets in the European Commissions draft proposal, on account of the size and power of their content-sharing platformsInthe supporterscamp, EU sources argue thatthe Commissions proposals willhelp European creative and copyright-centered industries flourish in a Digital Single Market, and European authors reach new audiences  while making regionalworks widely accessible to EUcitizens and across borders",tech
"The aim is to ensure a good balance between copyright and relevant public policy objectives such as education, research, innovation and the needs of persons with disabilities, one EU source told usWe trust that the discussions in the Council and the European Parliament will aim to maintain this ambition and will facilitate access to and use of copyright-protected content online and ensuring a well-functioning copyright marketplaceAt the launch of the draft proposals last year, Andrus Ansip, VPfor the Digital Single Market, summed up the balance the EC is seeking to strikethus:Europes creative content should not be locked-up, but it should also be highly protected, in particular to improve the remuneration possibilities for our creators",tech
"Neighboring rights for newsAmong the most controversial elements of the proposals are an extra copyright provision for using snippets of journalistic content online  a so-called neighboring right for news sites, which critics describe asan attack on the hyperlink",tech
"Thiscouldapply to link previews generated by news aggregators like Google News, for example, orsocial network sites like Facebook linking out to news articles But there are also suggestions it may disproportionately impact startups in thenews aggregation and/or media monitoring space",tech
"Although EU sources emphasize there is no requirement thatpublishers levy a charge for their content  rather, it is up to publishersto decide on conditions for use of their content, with the argument being that the neighboring right would give publishers a stronger legal basis to negotiate with third partiesA similar law was enacted in Germany in 2013, but uncertainty remains about what actually constitutes a snippet  and local publishers ended up offering Google free consent to display their snippets after they saw traffic fall substantially whenGoogle stopped showingtheir content rather than pay for using themSpain also enacted a similar ancillary copyright law for publishers in 2014, but its implementation required publishers to charge for using their snippets  leading Google to permanently close its news aggregation service in the country A subsequent economic study found thesignificant drop in traffic associated with the shuttering of Google News in Spain mostly affected smaller, niche or newcomer publishers But even large media entities there have come out againstthe law",tech
"Content monitoringAnother highly controversial portion of the copyright proposal is a requirement on websites that host large amounts of user-generated content to monitor user behavior to identify and prevent copyright infringement So, in other words, to shiftfrom reviewing reportedcontent after it has been publishedto proactively scanning at the point of upload to try to prevent copyright infringementshappening in the first placeCritics complain this approach wouldcompel private companies to police the internet on behalf of rights holders",tech
"Measures taken must also be proportionate, and should not be unnecessarily complicated or costly for the service providers, according to thesource Nor are specific technologies or solutions imposedIt is for the services to find the appropriate and proportionate measures, which could be developed either internally or using for example third party services, as done by a number of services already today, the source added, arguing that the proposal strikes a balance between different interests",tech
"It imposes obligations on platforms with large amounts of copyright protected content, which can be expected, due to their role on the content market, to have certain responsibilities It also introduces safeguards for businesses and users It does not introduce a general obligation to monitor content",tech
"There has also been disappointment among copyright reformists that the EChas not soughtto harmonize rules across the EU to recognize and put beyond legal doubtdigital remix culture, such asthe ability to create GIFs, memes, supercuts etc  types of digital contentwhich may currently, at least technically, becopyright infringements in some EU member statesThe European Parliament has been debating the copyright reform proposals for the past few months, as it formulates its official reaction to the draft proposals and seeks to push for specific changes And this week members of the European Parliament submitted their amendments to the Commissions proposals, as part of that processIve submitted my amendments to the #copyright reform",tech
"At the same time, when it comes to the measures that are proposed on the marketplace I think they are actively harmful, so on the one hand you have a provision that would force any company or not even company any host provider that is basically giving users the possibility to upload content on their own an obligation to monitor what the users are doing  and this is not only extremely costly for all the providers, it could be anyone from Wikipedia to GitHub to photo communities, but its also a violation of fundamental rights In the past the European Court of Justice has made it very clear that member states are not allowed to impose a general obligation on internet providers to monitor what users are doing And this is exactly what this law would do But this is the one big criticism that I think is relevant when it comes to how this would affect the internet ecosystemThe other one is the proposal to extend copyright for press publishers and allow them to ask for licence fees for the reproduction of even the smallest snippets of content  so, for example, the headline of a news article",tech
I think its a fundamentally bad idea to write content recognition technology into law Not just because its extremely invasive but because it systematically ignores users rightsThe other problem is that its trying to misrepresent the legal status of hosting providers in the EU,tech
"Then in the case of images of child abuse, its relatively clear  the legal situation is essentially the same all around the world",tech
I mean something that an investor certainly does not want to have is legal uncertainty,tech
And I think the third kind of startup that is particularly affected by this is any kind of platform for sharing user-generated content,tech
"TC: On the flip side, you could argue that while algorithmsmay not be using the work itself there is a kind of value exchange going on, based on extracting something useful (and potentially profitable) from the dataReda: Copyright law was never designed to be based on whether or not you are commercially benefiting from the use or not  I mean, if this were the case then all non-commercial use of copyrighted works should be legal, but its not Its always based on whether or not youre performing certain protected uses such as making a copy And in the digital world you just need to make copies a lot more than in the analogue world I think that would have been perfectly legal in an analogue content  such as reading a book and counting the number of times a certain word is used is not a copyright-relevant act in any way And just when youre using a computer to do the same thing, then it suddenly is",tech
"The other issue is that it only makes sense to require people to get a license if its actually possible to get a license But how would this work? If somebodys just scraping loads of images off social media, for example, the rights holders of those images are spread all over the world  there are millions of them, and if you actually contacted them and said hey I want to use your cat picture that you posted on Twitter for training my AI, can you please given me a license, they would not know what the hell youre talking about The transaction cost of actually trying to do this legally would be so high that it would simply not pay to do this kind of research anymore",tech
"TC: Ihavent personally heard many European startups voicing concerns aboutthe EU copyright reform  do you think theres an awareness problem here? Or maybethey dont yetrealize the potential implications down the line?Reda: I have a somewhat different impression Because when we invited some startups to come to Brussels to speak about their experience it was extremely easy to find startups that were concerned about this, and had very specific concerns about either the neighboring right or the content monitoring Of course, if youre a startup founder you probably dont have the resources to lobby in the same way that a large company does because youre basically spending all of your time on developing your product, but nevertheless there are a number of startups that are actually coming to Brussels and talking to policymakers",tech
"TC: What arguments are you hearing from larger tech companies  like Apple, Google, Facebook, Spotify  about thecopyright reform?Reda: Apple, I have to say, has not been particularly active on this And also Google Theyre mostly active through their business associations",tech
"I met with Apple this week but they were more concerned about the Electronic Communications Code, so the telecoms review that is going on at the moment They did have concerns about the content-monitoring provisionIve spoken to SoundCloud and they are really quite concerned about this, and they were quite open in saying that if this kind of provision had existed when they started out, they would have never managed to survive And nevertheless, they are kind of a licensed service nowadays and are able to work with the rights holders",tech
TC: Youve personally been pushing for copyright reform for years  and made it your legislative priority Why is that? And what wouldyou really like to see happen? What would be your ideal copyright reform?Reda: I think that copyright reform is absolutely crucial for access to knowledge and empowerment of people I think the cultural sector is just one small element of this,tech
"I am more pessimistic when it comes to the content-monitoring provision because there its extremely difficult to change this proposal into something that is not harmful Its a very complex ecosystem and I think not everybody is aware of the problems associated with content recognition technologies And as you were saying, its kind of mixed up with the discussions around terrorism and hate speech And I think thats always a very bad starting point for having a really targeted copyright reform that its not mixing up a lot of different issues So there Im a lot more skeptical",tech
"TC:What happens next? Whats the timeline from here?Reda: The European parliament has presented its report, and the deadline for amendments to that is actually today [last Wednesday] So after everybody has tabled their amendments the person who wrote the report, the rapporteur, is going to take those amendments and form them into compromises",tech
TC:So theres still a chance for substantial amendments?Reda:Basically so far the proposal from the Commission is only the starting point And nobody is bound by what the Commission has proposed,tech

"Simple, the online banking service that promised to be a better alternative to big banks like Chase or Citibank, is falling short of some users expectations This time, it comes as a result of the sudden and surprising notice customers received alerting them that their accounts would be closed next monthOn Thursday, Simple sent notice to a small number of customers with the subject line We have to close your account on May 13 The notice went on to explain that the closures were theresult of a massive account migration the company has been working on for the last severalmonths Those userswouldnt make the cut before Simples contract with its former partner bank ended, leaving them out in the cold",tech
"Simple launchedits banking service in 2012, offering a forward-thinking and tech-enabled alternative to traditional brick-and-mortar banking options",tech
"In reality, the service sometimes fell short of some users expectations, due to occasional outagesand glitches that plagued userseven after it was acquiredby BBVA for $117 million three years agoSimplesacquisition by BBVA and its migrationto the Spanish banking groups infrastructure is the main reason behind the account closure notices issued yesterday",tech
"Still, with something as sensitive as banking, inconveniencingevena small number of userscan have an outsized effect on public perception As with other previous setbacks,it takes a long time to build consumertrust when it comes to dealing with someones money  and sending someone a notice that youre closing their bank account in 30 days probably doesnt helpUber, the popular ride-hailing startup, shared a grip of new financial metrics with Bloomberg today",tech
"Uber, presumably, hopes that by releasing its revenue growth figures it can change the narrative concerning its business The company, for some time, was known best as a disruptive startup busy setting records for growth Its leadership would likely welcome a return to the prior storyline",tech
"Today were going to walk through the numbers together First, well lay out the facts Following, well figure out what it all means",tech
"Facts, figures, adjusted lossesUber had gross bookings of $20 billion, according to information shared with Bloomberg",tech
The company lost an adjusted $28 billion in 2016 That figure rises to a $3,tech
"So, on an adjusted basis, Uber lost around $38 billion in 2016 The real figure, using a full-GAAP reckoning, is likely higher Merely employing the $38 billion figure, Uber had a -58",tech
"Bloomberg notes that Ubers gross bookings rose by 28 percent from the third quarter to the fourth quarter of 2016, resulting in net revenue of $29 billion for the final three months of the year",tech
Do thelosses matter?It is not a surprise that Uber loses money The company is large enough that drips of its financial performance have been slipping through the cracks for some time,tech
"However, that Uber is losing just under $1 billion on an adjusted basis per quarter is notable Thats a staggering pace of burn, especially when you mentally adjust it to fully account for Ubers cost profileUber has previously had little to no issue raising capital to fuel its continuing operations and growth; however, given the taint of scandal currently swirling around the firm, and its continued losses despite its age, valuation and time-in-market, private investors could be less interested",tech
"It isnt hard to understand questions that new or potentially recurring investors might ask: Given that UberPOOL revenue is counted differently than traditional Uberx revenue, should we trust your non-GAAP revenue over the GAAP result? That would put Uber in the tough position of arguing that investors should only pay attention to its GAAP revenue, and its non-GAAP losses, while investors might have an inclination to the opposite, focusing instead on the companys more modest non-GAAP revenues and its larger GAAP losses",tech
"All that sums to a murky ask: What is Ubers path to profitability?The profitability huntCorrections and caveats aside, Ubers adjusted operating margin dramatically improved in the fourth quarter compared to the third Its GAAP revenue grew 74 percent while its adjusted losses grew a mild 5 percent That means its ratio of top to (negative) bottom lines got better",tech
"That is the sort of improvement that quickly growing, but yet-unprofitable companies like to show investors as they discuss their future No company expects to lose money forever Uber most certainly does not",tech
"That clarifies our question about Ubers path to profits as more a timing question: How quickly can Uber get to profitability?It will depend on a host of factors, including the companys ride-expense outflow",tech
"Yet, as evident by the latest financials, Uber is losing a lot of money That means it is very reliant on investors to keep giving it more",tech
"Thus far, Uber has had success in attracting a long list of investors to add to its coffers, valuing the company at a massive $68 billion, making it by far the largest venture-backed companyBut the price is getting pretty steep and investors may be increasingly skeptical at Ubers growth prospects",tech
"Perhaps this Bloomberg exclusive is a way to test the waters and see how the public reacts, but its likely just an attempt to thwart its growing cadre of naysayersWhat we still dont knowWhile there have been financial leaks from different periods in time, we are lacking a clear picture of Ubers revenue growth quarter-by-quarter and year-over-yearAnd the way they account for UberPOOLrevenue is murky It would be helpful more detail about what percentage of this is paid to driversWeve posted contribution margins, which shows the revenue-cost breakdown of their primary ridesharing business, but we have yet to get the full account of Ubers other endeavors",tech
"UberEATS, its food-delivery business, has expanded to dozens of cities throughout the world Based on a report from The Information last year, UberEATS was forecast to contribute $100 million in net revenue, but also contribute to more than $100 million in additional losses for 2017, due to the costs of incentivizing drivers to participate in this newer service",tech
"Uber is growing, but so are losses, albeit at a slower pace than the revenue gains",tech
The Chinese hardware maker confirmed in a statement to TechCrunch the story first spotted by Variety,tech
"The company surely saw EcoPass as a cornerstone for its US play, bolstered by sales of phones and TVs to serve up that content, Fire-style And accordingly, devices like the Le Pro3 felt like they were built specifically around LeEcos big video play Therecent acquisition of an English language production company, the (now dead)planned purchase of U",tech
S-based TV maker Vizio and the funding of the utterly disappointing Matt Damon historical fantasy epic The Great Wall all played into the planThe decision to sunset EcoPass is the latest in a string of bad news for a company that seemingly just cant catch a break of late,tech
"S strategies Back in November, a spokesperson for the company told TechCrunch, how sincere, how honest, is this company of the thing we are trying to build globally",tech
"Right now, however, it certainly feels like theres a whole lot the company isnt sayingFacebook proudly announced today that it has  it thinks  put an end to the nefarious doings of a sophisticated, coordinated operation that has been spamming the site for the last six monthsIn a blog post, Facebooks security team suggested the inauthentic likes came from accounts in Bangladesh, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, and a number of other countries",tech
"As far as volume, the post scrupulously avoids real numbers:As we remove the rest of the inauthentic likes, we expect that 99% of impacted Pages with more than 10,000 likes will see a drop of less than 3%If you can figure out what that means, feel free to comment below What about the fake likes and accounts removed before now? How many pages were affected? Are pages with fewer likes affected less, or more? Are there other networks currently being fought in similar ways, and, if so, what kind of drops should we expect when those get rolled up?No doubt this is good news for everyone, but I cant help but get the same feeling from Facebook here that I get from Twitter when it dances around the numbers of bots and spammers on its network",tech
"In other Apple news, the California DMV released a list of companies allowed to test autonomous vehicles on the roads of California",tech
It doesnt necessarily mean that youre going to see an Apple car on the road tomorrow but it means that the company has the green light tostart real-world tests at some point in the future3,tech

"Today, Musio engages users in small talk, answers their trivia questions in a personable tone, admits when it doesnt know something and can correct a users grammar The robot works in conjunction with curriculum, including printed books and games, developed by educational publisher Gakken, that are purchased separately or as part of a premium Musio packageMusios face and heart are touchscreens",tech
"AI giants like Apple, Amazon, Baidu, Google, IBM and Tencent make plenty of their technology available to developers who want to offervoice control, natural language processing or emotional intelligenceas part of their apps or hardware ButAKA is developing a range of proprietary AI engines These allow the company and its Musio robot to recognize and remember a particular user, build rapport with them over time and reference past conversations",tech
"This kind of machine learning also enables Musio to identify where learners need help advancing their language skills For example, if Musio recalls that a user previously got questions wrong around a vocabulary module involving dinosaurs, it can suggest a review of that material with a user when they next chatJung explained, Musio will also answer your questions, but our competitive advantage is conversing with you naturally",tech

"First, lets all agree that podcasting is getting big Once the domain of amateur mumblers who spoke at length about laptop specs or chemtrails, podcasting has become big business and listeners are paying attention",tech
"Again, these numbers pale in comparison to the budgets of cable TV and Internet This website alone has 8 million followers on Twitter and does 18 million pageviews in a few hours",tech
"Now back to my hyperbolic title  can podcasting truly save the world? First, we have to assume that the world wants long form writing on the Internet I think this is true We love stories and consuming those stories in audio format is a true treat",tech
"If I were in the betting game Id say that podcasts will rise in popularity as television and radio wane News, commentary, and histories work quite well in the podcasting medium",tech
"The Study Watch, accordingly, doesnt possess the pizzazz of Googles consumer electronics offerings, but from the sound of the companys rundown, its built to be a workhorse And the fact that it looks and acts like a standard wristwatch goes a ways toward making the data collection process less obtrusive than more traditionalvital-gathering devices",tech
The device sports a heavy-lifting process designed for real-time algorithmic computations Its also got a slew of sensors for collecting a lot more data that your standard heart-rate monitoring smartwatch,tech
"Multiple physiological and environmental sensors are designed to measure relevant signals for studies spanning cardiovascular, movement disorders, and other areas, says Verily in a post announcing the device Examples include electrocardiogram (ECG), heart rate, electrodermal activity, and inertial movements",tech
"Battery life is also key here, as the device is meant to be worn for long stretches Verilysays its able to get a week on the device, thanks to what looks to be an e-ink-style always-on display Theres also lot of on-board storage, so users dont have to sync the device too often, which ought to help with the aforementioned unobtrusiveness",tech

"Its also interesting to note that Apple is not afraid of exposing its cars on the roads of California Apple hasnt been as secretive as it usually is with this project Building a self-driving car requires a ton of data, so the company needs to put its car on the road as quickly as possibleFeatured Image: Bryce DurbinIn March, Google introduced its own parental control software for parents of kids with Android devices called Family Link  but there was a bit of a catch In order for the system to work, it required that both parent and child use Android",tech
"S, where Family Link is currently availableThe parental control platform is still in testing When Google unveiled the software last month, it explained that parents would first have to request an invite to join the program The idea is that Google wants to first work out the kinks and get feedback from early adopters before making Family Link more broadly available",tech
"As for the software itself, Family Link lets parents set some basic limits on how their child can use their Android phone It offers tools that allow parents to either block or approve app downloads similar totheiCloud Family Sharing Ask feature on Apple devices  or block apps that are already installedIn addition, parents can track how much time kids are spending in which apps through weekly and monthly activity reports, remotely lock the childs device on a set schedule (device bedtimes), and configure daily screen timelimits",tech
"The iOS version, released on Thursday, doesnt appear to have any new features compared with its Android counterpart  it simply ports the parental control app to Apples platformThere are a few other caveats to be aware of if you want to try Family Link, however",tech

"The iMessage App Store doesnt yet have a lot of breakout hits at this point, but group video chatting seems to be an exception Last month, a growing video chat app called Fam raised $18 million to continue to invest in its video chat platform, with the intention of expanding to include features like game-playing, interactive live masks and filters, and  yes  watching videos together",tech
"But Lets Watch It! has beaten Fam to the gate with its own implementation ofgroup video viewing, as it turns outThe app, has been around sinceearly March, but recently added support for turningon the front-facing camera and the microphone in the app, giving it more of a social, real-time feel But these features are optional  you can toggle a switch at the bottom of the screen to enable or disable the functionality as neededAs for the video viewing experience itself, Lets Watch It! does a goodjob here If anything, the most difficult thing about using the app is navigatingtheclunky iMessage App Store, and then getting to the app from the iMessage interface",tech
"If one person has already started watching the video, the newcomer will be joined at the same spot so the two streams are synced up",tech
"In testing, I didnt have issues with the videos not syncing or any lagging, but there was one small glitch that I came across When a video finishes, the app moves on to whatever video it has queued up to auto-play next If you then try to tap the video thumbnail you were sent in iMessage to re-watch the original video again, it doesntplay",tech
"This feature is likely by design As latecomers join in a group video viewing session by tapping on the thumbnail, it makes sense to sync them up to whichever video the group has moved on to next, instead of the first that was sent out But its still not ideal",tech
"However, this is aminor quirk, and can be resolved by seeking out the original video and re-sending it as a new thumbnail in iMessageThe app was created by the team from NEA-backedLittle Labs, which is regularly experimenting with new app platforms, having previously built smartwatch-first apps like a watch face designer for Android Wear calledFacer, mobile games for Apple Watch, and more recently, games for iMessage",tech

"Editors note: Alex Wilhelm is the editor-in-chief of Crunchbase NewsIn just nine days, France is going to vote for their next president  theres going to be a second round face-off in three weeks too And it looks like Facebook wants to avoid another fake news scandal as the company is preemptively running full page ads in major French newspapers",tech
"The ad gives ten tips to spot fake news on the internet Youll find it today in the paper edition of Le Monde, Les chos, Libration, Le Parisien, 20 Minutes and potentially other newspapers",tech
"Shortly after the election of US President Donald Trump, Facebook admitted that it was partly responsible for the spread of misinformation",tech
These efforts are interesting for a few of reasons,tech
"Second, its a bit sad that Facebook itself has to teach everyone how to spot fake news Im sure most people could read an article and say that it looks fake But the issue is that too many people still blindly share a headline on Facebook without reading the actual articles",tech
"Finally, Im not sure a coordinated advertising campaign in major newspapers is really effective Most people dont read newspapers anymore, at least not the paper version Id even say that people who spend time readingnewspapers are probably better informed than an average person and could spot fake news more easily",tech
So I dont think this advertising campaign is about informing people about fake news Facebook wants to show that it is tackling the issue of fake news ahead of the election Im sure journalists working for all those publications are going to notice those ads and subconsciously think that Facebook isnt turning a blind eye this time,tech

"With a letter straight to the top, a group of Marines is demandingthatFacebook get a grip on the systemic harassment that plagues its female servicemembersIn March, Facebook becamethe epicenter of the Marines United scandal, which exposed a massive online community where users shared often intimate photos of servicewomen without their consent While suchcontent isnt limited to Facebook, it has thrived there and continues to do so in the aftermath of the scandal, which the USMC is still struggling to contain",tech

"For Facebook leadership to publicize their value to the military family, then ignore its complicity in the misconduct perpetrated by its users is, at best, naive At its worst, this failure directly contributes to the inescapable sexism that is part of the military cultureSandbergs interest in gender equality is well established, if at times superficial",tech
"In her letter, Kirk-Cuomo argues that Facebooks failure to act decisively against harassment against its service members is both hypocrisy and implicit approval of the kind of toxic behavior thats been allowed to run rampant on its platform:In the wake of the Marines United unmasking, dozens of similar and copycat groups have been created The current screening and reporting process remains largely ineffective",tech

"If youve dug into any articles on artificial intelligence, youve almost certainly run into the term neural network Modeled loosely on the human brain, artificial neural networks enable computers to learn from being fed dataThe efficacy of this powerful branch of machine learning, more than anything else, has been responsible for ushering in a new era of artificial intelligence, ending a long-lived AI Winter",tech
"Thinking by brute forceOne of the early schools of AI taught that if you load up as much information as possible into a powerful computer and give it as many directions as possible to understand that data, it ought to be able to think This was the idea behind chess computers like IBMs famous Deep Blue: By exhaustively programming every possible chess move into a computer, as well as known strategies, and then giving it sufficient power, IBM programmers created a machine that, in theory, could calculate every possible move and outcome into the future and pick the sequence of subsequent moves to outplay its opponent This actually works, as chess masters learned in 1997",tech

"Machines  theyre just like us!An artificial (as opposed to human) neural network (ANN) is an algorithmic construct that enables machines to learn everything from voice commands and playlist curation to music composition and image recognitionThe typical ANN consists of thousands of interconnected artificial neurons, which are stacked sequentially in rows that are known as layers, forming millions of connections",tech
"Just as when parents teach their kids to identify apples and oranges in real life, for computers too, practice makes perfectTake, for example, image recognition, which relies on a particular type of neural network known as the convolutional neural network (CNN)  so called because it uses a mathematical process known as convolution to be able to analyze images in non-literal ways, such as identifying a partially obscured object or one that is viewable only from certain angles",tech
"So many layersTypically, a convolutional neural network has four essential layers of neurons besides the input and output layers:ConvolutionActivationPoolingFully connectedConvolutionIn the initial convolution layer or layers, thousands of neurons act as the first set of filters, scouring every part and pixel in the image, looking for patterns As more and more images are processed, each neuron gradually learns to filter for specific features, which improves accuracyIn the case of apples, one filter might be focused on finding the color red, while another might be looking for rounded edges and yet another might be identifying thin, stick-like stems",tech
"One advantage of neural networks is that they are capable of learning in a nonlinear wayWhats particularly powerful  and one of the neural networks main claims to fame  is that unlike earlier AI methods (Deep Blue and its ilk), these filters arent hand designed; they learn and refine themselves purely by looking at data",tech
"The convolution layer essentially creates maps  different, broken-down versions of the picture, each dedicated to a different filtered feature  that indicate where its neurons see an instance (however partial) of the color red, stems, curves and the various other elements of, in this case, an apple But because the convolution layer is fairly liberal in its identifying of features, it needs an extra set of eyes to make sure nothing of value is missed as a picture moves through the networkActivationOne advantage of neural networks is that they are capable of learning in a nonlinear way, which, in mathless terms, means they are able to spot features in images that arent quite as obvious  pictures of apples on trees, some of them under direct sunlight and others in the shade, or piled into a bowl on a kitchen counter This is all thanks to the activation layer, which serves to more or less highlight the valuable stuff  both the straightforward and harder-to-spot varietiesIn the world of our garage-sale organizer or clutter consultant, imagine that from each of those separated piles of things weve cherry-picked a few items  a handful of rare books, some classic t-shirts from our college days to wear ironically  that we might want to keep",tech
"PoolingAll this convolving across an entire image generates a lot of information, and this can quickly become a computational nightmare Enter the pooling layer, which shrinks it all into a more general and digestible form There are many ways to go about this, but one of the most popular is max pooling, which edits down each feature map into a Readers Digest version of itself, so that only the best examples of redness, stem-ness or curviness are featured",tech
"In the garage spring cleaning example, if we were using famed Japanese clutter consultant Marie Kondos principles, our pack rat would have to choose only the things that spark joy from the smaller assortment of favorites in each category pile, and sell or toss everything else So now we still have all our piles categorized by type of item, but only consisting of the items we actually want to keep; everything else gets sold (And this, by the way, ends our de-cluttering analogy to help describe the filtering and downsizing that goes on inside a neural network",tech
"Source: GumGumFully connectedNow its time to start getting answers In the fully connected layer, each reduced, or pooled, feature map is fully connected to output nodes (neurons) that represent the items the neural network is learning to identify If the network is tasked with learning how to spot cats, dogs, guinea pigs and gerbils, then itll have four output nodes",tech
Tweaks and adjustments are made to help each neuron better identify the data at every level,tech
The job (which theyve learned on the job) of both the apple and orange nodes is essentially to vote for the feature maps that contain their respective fruits,tech
"We are in the midst of a true inflection point in computing, and the very way we interface with technology daily is changing",tech
"The rapid inclusion of embedded sensors and internet connectivity is turning most of the appliances we use into smart devices that can respond to our voice commands, while generating masses of data that is in turn analyzed in edge-of-network hub computers or the cloud",tech
"We are seeing virtual and augmented reality now just starting to ramp adoption, and these technologies require significant compute and graphics processing to have a more real-life experience",tech
"The laws of physics cant be fooled, and we have reached a level where the miniaturization of transistors is now bumping against physical limitsNew semiconductor technology nodes will still bring significant miniaturization and lower power over the next decade, but the cost is increasing and the historical improvements in speed are not achievedThe laws of physics cant be fooled and we have reached a level where the miniaturization of transistors is now bumping against physical limits",tech
"So we face a dichotomy as the historical improvements of Moores Law slow, while new compute-intensive applications require exponentially more capability This is driven by insatiable consumer demand for more data and more data processing, more real-time information and faster services Self-driving cars, drones and robotics all require massively more real-time information processing, inference and interpretation",tech
"For fail-safe operation or quick responsiveness, the computation cant all be done in the cloud",tech
This power enables virtual and augmented reality to render lifelike images and augmented overlays of contextually relevant information or graphics on top of a real-world view,tech
"The Royal College of Medicine has already recorded surgeries in VR, and you can quite easily imagine an AR overlay providing real-time information to help a surgeon perform with more accuracy These are truly disruptive applicationsThe disruption will affect industry, and after industry, if the computing can stay on pace, how best to keep it going amid the decline of Moores Law? How do we provide more compute?It turns out that there are many more levers that engineers can manipulate to drive future performance gains",tech
"Software application ecosystems that make it easy to program apps using the advanced computation of machine learning, data analytics and the rendering for VR/ARIn a Moores Law Plus era, universities and industry will apply these levers to drive performance forward On the foundry front, extreme ultraviolet lithography will be an effective technique to drive small process node manufacturing forward, leading to new and smaller transistors These will be wired together with new metal constructs to lower resistance There will be further manufacturing advances on semiconductors",tech
"Future applications will require more memory, whether on a PC or mobile device or server For servers, certain workloads, especially with machine learning, virtualization applications, and database processing, have an insatiable demand for more memory Yet, our year-over-year density increases for memory have been declining Once again, innovation is leading to new gains as can be seen with new non-volatile memory, and stacked memoryThere are also advances in packaging with less expensive techniques to connect multiple dies on an organic package",tech
"To continue advances in a Moores Law Plus world requires co-engineering and a cooperative approach across the semiconductor industry with different manufacturers, working with academia, and open standards to create an easy-to-program environment",tech

"NASA held a press conference on Thursday to reveal some exciting new discoveries about ocean worlds within our solar system: It has found evidence that suggest a type of chemical energy that can support life exists on Enceladus, one of Saturns 62 confirmed moons The new evidence comes from the Cassini spacecraft, which has been probing Saturn and its natural satellites since 2004 and beaming data back to Earthbound researchers",tech
"The discovery is not a surefire guarantee that theres life on Enceladus, or anywhere else beyond Earth, but it is the closest weve come, so far, to identifying a place with some of the ingredients needed for a habitable environment, according to NASAs Thomas Zurbuchen, as quoted in a press release",tech
"Specifically, hydrogen gas is thought to be coming from sub-sea vents and into the oceans of Enceladus, where it would provide the energy required their to support life forms including microbes The process by which microbes break down hydrogen and produce methane as a resulting byproduct is thought to be fundamental to how life formed on Earth",tech
"Enceladus is small and ice-covered, as compared to Earth, but it has liquid water, and just about everything required for life The only ingredients Cassini hasnt yet confirmed are present are phosphorus and sulfur in the moons oceans, but thats still something researchers studying the planet expect to find, given the apparent geological makeup of Enceladus",tech

"In a section discussing software problems, the committee describes the website crash as the most significant example of software failure, and says it cannot rule out the possibility thattheexceptional surge in demand to register for votes ahead of the deadline last June wascaused by a distributed denial of service(DDoS) attack using botnetsThe reportsaysthe crash hasindications of being a DDOS  basedon what the committee dubs askey indicants for such an attack: timing and relative volume rate",tech

"The committee istherefore recommending that the government takes specific measures aimed atbolstering the cyber security of election and referendum processesin light of the risk of foreign powers seeking to influence outcomes, while also lauding the UKs prioritizing of cyber securityin recent years (back in 2015 former chancellor George Osborne named cyber securitya priority, and announced a plan to double spending over the next five years)We commend the government for promoting cyber security as a major issue for the UK We recommend that Cabinet Office, the Electoral Commission, local government, GCHQ and the new government Cyber Security Centre establish permanent machinery for monitoring cyber activity in respect of elections and referendums, for promoting cyber security and resilience from potential attacks, and to put plans and machinery in place to respond to and to contain such attacks if they occur, the committeewrites",tech

Beyond Good & Evil 2 is dramatically different from the original  and thats about all I can confidently say about the ambitious new game,tech
"Not long after the reveal, Ancel and his team took me through a very early technical demonstration of the game Where the original Beyond Good & Evil was a fairly straightforward third-person action adventure, its follow-up is something much larger and more complex",tech
"Theres still a lot of work to do, Ancel says, but we now really believe that were going to make this gameBut first, some clarification: while they bear the same name, this Beyond Good & Evil 2 and the one originally unveiled a decade ago are different games Initially, the game was planned as a sequel, continuing the intrigue-laden story that turned the first Beyond Good & Evil into a beloved cult classic Eventually, Ancel and his team at Ubisofts Montpellier studio decided to switch directions and create a prequel The idea was to build an experience that could be enjoyed by anyone, regardless of whether or not they played the first game",tech
Three years ago they started working on the technology that would power the experience  it started out as a kind of solar system simulation tool  and only recently have they started actually building the game,tech
"Just what kind of game Beyond Good & Evil 2 will be is hard to pin down It takes place in the same universe as the original, and is set a few generations before the events of that game (Ancel insists its not a reboot",tech
"In a big shift from the first game, the prequel is structured like an RPG You and your crew will develop new skills over time, and how you grow and change will reportedly depend on what you do and where you go",tech
"Beyond Good & Evil 2 will be both a single-player experience and a co-operative online game, as Ancel says youll be able to play either by yourself or with friends Theres also a shared world component, as certain in-universe events will happen for all players in the game The worlds youll be exploring, Ancel explains, are a combination of hand-designed and procedurally generated He describes it as like a SimCity simulation Essentially, the developers have built all of the individual parts, as well as a logic system that puts them together in ways that make sense",tech
"It all sounds incredibly ambitious, especially when you consider that Ancel also wants to treat Beyond Good & Evil 2 as something of an early access title, with a community of players offering feedback and testing early prototypes",tech

"It was tucked in the back of an agenda item, says Nicole Ozer, director of technology and civil liberties policy for the ACLU of California The City Council approved the purchase of the $8,000 drone as part of a million-dollar federal grant, but there had been no public debate over the merits of acquiring such a controversial piece of equipment",tech
"Ozer asked community members if they knew about the drone purchase We thought maybe we just missed it but everyone else knew about it, Ozer says",tech
"We found, across the board, that even basic public conversation and debate was absent, Ozer saysThe drone discovery was one of the events that led Californias Santa Clara County to become, in June 2016, the first in the country to pass an ordinance requiring transparency for police surveillance technology based on a recent ACLU model The law requires public input, an impact report, and a use policy with details about data sharing before equipment is purchased (Seattle passed a similar law in 2013, also with ACLU involvement, but its scope was limited to video surveillance)Last fall, the ACLU announced a nationwide strategy in partnership with over a dozen other civil liberties groups to promote similar bills in cities across the country",tech
"In California, bills are up for debate in Oakland, Berkeley, San Francisco, and Palo Alto",tech
"When communities know whats happening, they are in a much better position to fight against it, Ozer says You cant fight what you dont know",tech
"In Santa Clara County, where the law has been enforced since June 2016, community members say its working as intended, though the quality of use policies vary",tech
"The use policy of the Sheriffs Department and an early impact report approved a broad range of uses for the mapping system and thermal camera, and dismissed concerns about privacy as misinformed Approved uses in the draft policy include tracking suspects, evidence collection, and, most vaguely, other law enforcement or first responder uses not prohibited by law",tech
"That triggered a critical letter from the Electronic Frontier Foundation that called into question the necessity of the mapping system, arguing that aerial recordings of civilians created significant civil liberties problems The letter was not enough to sway Santa Claras Board of Supervisors, and the Sheriffs Departments use policy stayed as isAdam Schwartz, a lead counsel at the Electronic Frontier Foundation who authored the letter to the board, says that both the body cam and the FLIR case are evidence that CCOPS is effectiveWe would never have known this was happening if it wasnt for the ordinance, Schwartz says In both instances, we think the system worked the way its supposed to work",tech
"Other community members reiterated that merely being able to ask questions about surveillance technology and have them answered is reassuringSameena Usman is a coordinator at the Council of American-Islamic Relations Bay Area office, one of the groups that advocated for the ordinance in Santa Clara",tech
"That transparency has built trust, Usman saysThe ACLUs Marlow says that support for CCOPS-modeled legislation has largely been bipartisan We face neither resistance from the left or right, Marlow says",tech
"In Pensacola, Florida, a version of the ordinance is being sponsored by City Council member Jewel Cannada-Wynn, and it is backed the states NAACP chapter, as well as libertarian and Republican groups",tech
"How often do people from both parties agree on anything? says Sara Latshaw, regional organizer for the ACLU in Northwest Florida, who is overseeing CCOPS in FloridaBill Fetke is a member of the Republican Liberty Caucus, a conservative grassroots group, and a supporter of the ordinance in Pensacola",tech
"Most people kind of think Im wearing a tinfoil hat, he says",tech
"The spread in the use of body cameras by police departments across the country, often implemented with poor use policies, is another reason the surveillance bill is finding support",tech
"Zaki Manian, of Restore The Fourth, a Bay Area-based civil liberties group, says organizations like his have a complicated relationship with body cameras Manian believes they can be a tool for accountability, but mounting evidence suggests they could be used as just another surveillance technologyThe only way you can ethically sort of balance these concerns is with consent of people in the community, Manian says",tech
"But even supporters of CCOPS admit the legislation has its limits One fear is that the law would merely legitimize surveillance technologies that now exist in legal gray zonesWhen you pass a law, you create legality where there wasnt, says Malkia Cyril of the Center for Media Justice, a Bay Area nonprofit",tech
"Like the ordinance in Santa Clara and bills elsewhere, it requires a use policy and public comment for the purchase of any surveillance equipment But while the police commissioner would need to submit a use policy informed by public comments to the City Council, no city entity would need to approve a purchase The only oversight would come from the NYPD Inspector General, an independent agency that audits the NYPD, which would be tasked with making sure the NYPDs surveillance deployments are consistent with its own use policies The process is similar to the public consultation that the NYPD undertook prior to rolling out a pilot body camera program in April But that use policy came under criticism for not fully taking citizens opinions into account",tech
"Nevertheless, proponents argue the legislation will promote transparency and force police departments to think critically about surveillanceIts really about getting them to change the way they think, says Brian Hofer of Oakland Privacy",tech
"But the uncertainty as to whether the NYPD, or any police department across the country, will adhere to strengthened guidelines for their surveillance gear may be why advocates like Center for Media Justices Malkia Cyril are skeptical about an over-reliance on policy, while also acknowledging it as a necessary first stepPolicy is one thing, Cyril says Power is another",tech

"The plan would be to vent the rest of the propellant out into space, making the tank completely empty Or if the rocket uses cryogenic propellants, as many modern vehicles do, then the materials will boil off after a few days as the stage orbits Earth and is heated up by the Sun Once the tank is completely empty, Nanoracks will fill it with pressurized air from smaller vessels attached to the outside In fact, each of these tanks-turned-habitats will have smaller modules attached to the outside, containing vital supplies like life support systems and cargo that can be used to make the tank a viable place to live The modules can also be used to attach the stage to other habitats already in space",tech

"The most obvious change to the new Blade Stealth is both the least and most important: Razer is giving the range a new, more professional look The gunmetal gray variant ditches the glowing Razer logo for a more subtle two-tone one, and swaps the rainbow backlight keys for regular white ones Razer says that the gunmetal version is specifically designed for customers who want a more professional look from their computers, and, having been able to see a pre-production model of the new color in person, it certainly looks more suited to a work setting than Razers original version",tech
"But Razer is also upgrading the Blade Stealth on the hardware front, too The Blade Stealth now comes in two screen configurations: a full 4K 12-inch panel, which Razer had previously offered, and a new 3200 x 1800, 133-inch display that cuts the large bezels in half while keeping the rest of the body of the laptop the same size The trackpad, which was a particular pain point on the earlier models, has finally been replaced with a Windows Precision Trackpad, which should make the experience of using it better And Razer is boosting the RAM as well  the Blade Stealth now offers 16GB as standard, instead of only on the top configuration",tech
"The 133-inch model starts at $1,399 for a 256GB model and tops out at $1,999 for a 1TB version, while the 12-inch, 4K version offers a choice between a $1,599 computer with 512GB of storage and a 1TB version at $1,999",tech

"Beside freeing itself of the unpredictability of relying on other companies for critical components, Google's effort to control all the hardware inside its future devices will help it create more tailored, custom solutions For instance, look at the way that notifications on the Samsung Galaxy S8 are signaled with a pulse of blue light tracing its way around the edges of its almost bezel-less display  that's nowhere near as impressive on a phone without the S8's sleek design The coherence and synergy that can be drawn from hardware and software designers working in concert is best demonstrated by Apple, naturally, but I can envision future Google devices that have custom processing modules specifically to power Google's magical camera algorithms",tech

Thomas says",tech
"Around 3000 BCE, the ancient Egyptians became much more intentional about preserving their dead  kicking off the early days of mummification By 1550 BCE, anyone who could pay for a better body in the afterlife shelled out to become a mummy after they died",tech
"The embalming process went something like this: first, embalmers removed the deceaseds brain with a hooked instrument inserted through the nose",tech
"The Chinchorro people had a couple of different ways to preserve a cadaver  possibly as part of a belief system that used mummification to stay connected with the dead But the Black Mummies  which get their name from the black manganese paint that covered the cadaver  were the standouts, physical anthropologist Bernardo T",tech
"Once the abdomen was dry and the bones were clean, the whole body had to be put back together again, as if it were lying down on its back Cords tied the bones together, and sticks threaded up through the hips and rib cage, before passing into the skull like body-length splints The hollow insides were stuffed with grass, ashes, dirt, and animal hair",tech
"The process was also, no surprise, unpleasant, and deadly It starts out with this really nasty 1,000-day diet where youre just basically starving yourself and getting rid all of the fat in your body, Thomas explains The trick to self-mummification was to go low-carb Monks cut rice, barley, corn, millet, and beans from their diet, and substituted pine bark, grass roots, and nuts for three years or more The starvation diet altered the bodys composition to one that was strongly resistant to decomposition, Sakurai wrote",tech
"When he was close to death, the monk would enter an underground tomb to be buried alive Three years later, other monks would exhume the body and dry it over candle flames If the mummification was successful, the mummy was re-dressed in monks robes, and arranged in a seated position to be worshipped",tech
"As the ancient Egyptians learned, mummies can be made by accident, too The whole thing is just to somehow interrupt the natural biological process of decay, which means stopping bacteria, Thomas says That can happen in extremely arid, frozen, or soggy places",tech

"Bradley Tusk, an outside advisor to the company, told The Verge that he came away with three main takeaways The first was that Uber should report on a quarterly basis on the status of the implementation of each of the reports recommendations This would demonstrate that Uber cares about accountability and transparency",tech

"On the hardware side, while the Wii U was confusing to many  its tablet-like controller almost seemed like a Wii accessory as opposed to an entirely new platform  the benefits of the Switchs hybrid nature are much more obvious",tech

Sony didnt have a lot it needed to do at E3 this year,tech
"Given that E3 itself is just getting started, and weve yet to get some hands-on time with most of what Sony showcased at its presentation, its still too early to say whether or not Sony has come out as the so-called winner of E3 this year But can we break down Sonys announcements at its event to see how things stand for the PlayStation 4 moving into the second half of 2017 and beyondIn recent years, Sony has kept games its focus at E3, and this event was no exception The entire showcase was essentially a parade of trailers and gameplay clips for big-budget PlayStation exclusives: Uncharted: The Lost Legacy, Days Gone, God of War, Spider-Man, Detroit: Become Human, and an expansion for Horizon Zero Dawn In fact, Sony only featured a couple of games that werent exclusive to the PlayStation 4, including Destiny 2, which will have content available as a timed exclusive on PS4 and Call of Duty: WW2, which is getting an early multiplayer beta on PS4 this summer",tech
"Its a bold statement: if you want access to the most big-budget AAA games, then youll need a PlayStation",tech
"Console-exclusive titles are bad for players, but they arent going away anytime soon And Sony showed at E3 this year that its got a really strong lineup of big games for the PS4 going forward",tech
"Alongside the mainstream PS4 games was a dedicated section of the presentation for PSVR, which Sony seems to be taking more seriously than platforms like the Vita portable or Move motion controllers Until Dawn developer Supermassive Games showed off trailers for some more serious VR games: the horror thriller Inpatient and a squad-based shooter called Bravo Team On the lighter side of things, there was Starchild, a space adventure game with giant, glowing robots and Moss, which starred an adorable animated mouse warrior and is probably the closest thing were ever going to get to a Redwall game",tech
"There was one big surprise from Sony at the event, and it was a doozy Shadow of the Colossus, one of the most beloved PS2 games of all time, is getting a full HD remake next year",tech
"While Sony may have done an excellent job at highlighting its slate of upcoming software, the presentation was conspicuously lacking when it came to any mention of hardware, particularly the recently released PlayStation 4 Pro",tech
"Its a glaring omission given that close to a year after the Pro launched, there are still few PS4 games that support the updated hardware",tech

"Think of it as sailing the stratosphere, World View CEO Jane Poynter told The Verge in February",tech
"This flight will be the first one in which all of the different subsystems of the Stratollite are put to the test Before the company has tested out parts of the altitude control system, for instance, as well parts of the communications system",tech
"After this chicken run, World View eventually hopes its Stratollites can provide the same types of services as satellites for a much lower cost, since they dont have to launch on multimillion-dollar rockets Poynter thinks they could be particularly helpful for weather research and advanced evacuation warnings If you fly a Stratollite over that area, and you fly the radar pointing down at the ground, you get high fidelity ground wind information, Poynter said back in February",tech

"The big problem with weeding is, how do you tell the difference between a weed and a plant that you want to keep? Jones said in an interview with The Verge With a garden, you can recognize the difference between weeds and crops based on size",tech

"The Slack integration is particularly neat Once Astro has been linked to Slack, any searches will pull up results from both your inbox and your Slack channels I suspect this could make things very messy, since Slack searches surface conversations you were never even a part of But I like the idea of integrating an email client with the service thats supposed to  and in some cases does  kill emailYou wont be able to reply to Slack messages directly within Astro, but you will be able to tap on search results to jump straight to the conversation in Slack",tech
"Unfortunately, theres one big hiccup that I encountered while trying to test these integrations in a pre-release version of the app: you need administrative permissions in order to hook into a Slack account, and my company doesnt grant me that level of access I suspect a whole lot of people will find themselves in this situation, which means that Astros smart new integration wont get used unless you have a very trusting IT team Or, as Astro is hoping, a company that chooses to widely adopt its softwareThe Alexa integration, on the other hand, should be entirely doable on your own (Assuming, at least, that you arent trying to hijack someone elses Echo",tech

"It would be the dream machine for many: a true living room PC that at last erodes the division between the console space and the Windows ecosystem Arguments around exclusive titles, developer support, and even price would all be rendered moot if Microsoft could achieve what Valve, with its Steam machine philosophy, couldnt  all in a package far cheaper than your standard gaming PC",tech
"But Microsoft didnt do any of that In fact, it followed Sony almost to the tee, save the Xbox One Xs power boost over the PS4 Pro and the requisite $100 higher price tag The One X is, simply put, a more graphically capable Xbox",tech
"Nick has a redemption arc coming, so this setup gives him plenty of room for character improvement But the script doesnt do much to justify or underline that arc, beyond throwing in one line about the good man inside him, fighting to get out His ultimate act of altruism is muddled by sloppy storytelling, and the lead-up is vague and lazy",tech
"But consider how the story could have gone if the avaricious, rash, self-absorbed rogue of the opening scenes actually chose to throw in with the beautiful immortal whos offering him godhood Impulsively choosing eternal life and boundless power would be more in keeping with Nicks established character Itd be more in keeping with what hes seen of his available options",tech
"A climactic face-off between Set / Nick and Jenny would also be a fitting conclusion for the fights shes been having with him through the entire film, where she represents research, knowledge, and attention to detail, and he represents the forces of self-serving chaos",tech

"Microsofts press conference at this years E3 was always going to be the early highlight of the show Going in, we knew the company was planning on unveiling the final consumer version of Project Scorpio alongside a slate of new games and other announcements Right away, Microsoft gave us a name, Xbox One X, alongside pricing ($499) and a release date (November 7th)",tech
"That alone was enough to satisfy a torrent of news headlines and first reactions, and Microsoft followed it up by packing quite a bit of news into its two-hour presentation Some of it bodes well for the Xboxs ongoing comeback, while other announcements seem to further put the platform at risk as it struggles to keep pace with Sony and the more successful PlayStation 4 consoles Its far too early to declare which company won E3 this year",tech
"Sure, we dont know whether any of Crackdown 3s original promises of total city destruction will hold true Microsoft has already confirmed that the games single-player mode wont feature the seemingly revolutionary destructible environments that cloud computing platform Azure is supposed to provide",tech
Backwards compatibility is Microsofts go-to gotcha card when it wants to gin up support with fans and really stick it to the Sony diehards Because the PS4 is incapable of playing older games with software emulation  and Sony doesnt want to invest like Microsoft has  the Xbox platform is the best way to play games from back in the day like Skate 3 and Red Dead Redemption,tech
"At its E3 press conference, Microsoft took another victory lap in the backwards compatibility department by announcing support for some original Xbox games The company didnt tease a ton of titles  in fact, it just showed arcade flight game Crimson Skies  but we can assume there will be other big-name exclusive Xbox titles coming back from the dead Personally, games like Fable, Elder, Scrolls III: Morrowind, and Psychonauts would be enough to sell me on the feature",tech
"E3 is supposed to be the one time of the year that game companies pull out all the stops to convince consumers that the next year will be loaded with flashy blockbusters For Microsoft Studios, the companys in-house game development arm, that has traditionally meant announcing exclusive games that are supposed to make the Xbox a more enticing platform, especially in the face of an increasingly formidable lineup of PlayStation-only titles in recent months",tech
"As far as new big budget announcements, all fans received during yesterdays press conference was an official reveal of Forza Motorsport 7, a game pretty much everyone knew was coming Microsoft didnt tease the next Halo, which could have been an easy win",tech
"In a way, the launch of the Xbox One X at $499 puts Microsoft right back in its original predicament of offering a new home console and charging more than its primary competitor, all for features the mainstream gaming community may not want, at least right now Of course, better graphics and performance sounds, on paper, far more valuable that the Kinect was back in 2013, when it was bundled with the original Xbox One Yet Microsoft has handed Sony a potential victory: a console priced higher than the PS4 Pro Price was arguably what set the Xbox One back at launch, and theres a real chance it will do the same again with Xbox One XEero kicked off an arms race of router innovation when it launched the first mesh Wi-Fi system last year",tech
"All of this adds up to a very hard question: can Eero succeed in creating a new kind of ecosystem while facing down waves of competition and the inevitable pull to sell out?Eero announced itself in 2015 after CEO Nick Weaver spent time working at Menlo Ventures investing in companies like Dropcam and Roku Both companies struggled with bad connectivity in the home It drove a lot of their customer complaints, says Weaver",tech
Weaver left Menlo and started Eero with two co-founders in late 2014 The first office was his living room,tech
"Were making the radios do things they arent designed to do, says Weaver The first-gen Eeros have a pair of Qualcomm Wi-Fi radios used by several other companies, but Eero built custom drivers for them Most of these radios are designed to make one connection",tech
"Every Eero network connects up to Eeros cloud service, which constantly gathers data about how the systems are performing and what devices are on the network in order to optimize performance Every time Apple or Xbox or Sonos pushes a software update it slightly changes how the devices work and interact with the network, says Weaver We're constantly looking at how quickly devices get IP addresses, how well they roam, all these things that change",tech
Eero says its pushed more than 30 software updates since the product launched last year,tech
"All of that is nice, but the competing Luma mesh Wi-Fi system offers both parental controls and network monitoring for free",tech
"The new Eeros also support the Thread wireless standard, which may or may not be a huge deal in the future Thread is a long, long story Its a low-power wireless standard designed for smart home devices like locks and light switches that claims to fix the complexity of Bluetooth and weirdness of older standards like Z-Wave It was originally developed by Nest, and somewhat lost inside the drama that unfolded with Nests acquisition by Google and subsequent acquisition of Dropcam Google shipped a Thread-compatible chip in the Google OnHub router, but it was never enabled, and theres no Thread hardware in the newer Google Wifi mesh networking system",tech
"But Thread is also a mesh networking system, and having Eero also connect to lower-power devices like sensors and light switches means that you dont need unsightly and complicated hubs between your smart home gadgets and your network Theres a really healthy pipeline of [Thread] devices that have been ready for a long time, says Weaver Everyone has been waiting for a Thread border router so they dont have to do a $50 loss leader hub with every product they ship",tech
"Others have made this promise and it never came to fruition, he adds",tech
"The reason [the OnHub chips] havent been turned on is coexistence, says Weaver",tech
Existing Eero customers can add Thread support to their networks by adding or swapping in a second-gen Eero or Beacon unit,tech
So: a hot VC-backed hardware startup solving thorny technical problems with a cool product customers love thats just about to take the next step in terms of sales and marketing,tech
"Every single device that matters in the home is going to be connected to the internet and every piece of content we consume in the home is going to be delivered over the internet, says Weaver The opportunity here is to build a lasting brand at home",tech
"Eero is back: a little over a year after kickstarting the home mesh networking trend, the company is announcing its second-generation hardware According to the company, the new Eero provides double the speed and range of its predecessor, yet has the same footprint and form factor as before The second-generation Eero is also the first product on the market with fully functioning Thread support, so it will be able to connect to a variety of smart home devices expected to arrive in the near futureIn addition to the new, faster, and more powerful hub, Eero is also releasing a smaller product called the Beacon It is designed to extend the range and coverage of your Wi-Fi network just like the other hubs, but it has an even smaller size and plugs directly into a wall outlet",tech
"Ever since Eero launched its first mesh router, the market has been flooded with similar ideas and systems Incumbents like Netgear, Linksys, and TP-Link have all released mesh home router systems, and even Google and Samsung are in the router game now All of the systems basically do the same thing: provide strong Wi-Fi coverage throughout your home by using multiple nodes, or router units, that are wirelessly linked together",tech
"Eeros first-generation product delivered on its claims, and we found it to be quite the solution to troublesome home networking problems when we tested it",tech

"As per usual, Nintendo wont have an actual press conference at E3, but will instead announce news on a livestream on June 13th The keynote will be followed by additional streams showcasing the companys lineup of games, as well as competitive tournaments for games like Splatoon and ArmsHeres how to check it out:Starting time: San Francisco: 9AM / New York: 12PM / London: 5PM / Berlin: 6PM / Moscow: 7PM / Beijing: 12AM (June 14th) / Tokyo: 1AM (June 14th) / Sydney: 2AM (June 14th)",tech
"Keynote live stream: Nintendo will be streaming the event directly on its site, as well as on both Twitch and YouTubeMicrosoft unveiled its new Xbox One X console earlier this week, promising true 4K gaming on the worlds most powerful games console While many are debating what those promises truly mean and whether well see the majority of games in Native 4K or checkerboard rendering, Microsofts Xbox chief Phil Spencer believes the Xbox One X is a true 4K console",tech
"I look at [PS4] Pro as more of a competitor to [Xbox One] S than I do to Xbox One X, claims Spencer This is a true 4K console If you just look at the specs of what this box is, it's in a different league than any other console that's out there Spencer points out 40 percent more GPU speed, more RAM, and the speed of storage as the advantages of the Xbox One X over the PS4 Pro, but he also knocks Sonys methods for getting to 4K resolutions with some of its games When I think about techniques to somehow manufacture a 4K screen like what some other consoles try to do, this is different than that",tech
"Finally, Spencer addresses the lack of first-party game announcements during Microsofts E3 press conference Microsoft had plenty of big games to show, but in terms of announcements it was only Forza Motorsport 7 as a truly new triple-A title Spencer believes Ori, Super Luckys Tale, and Sea of Thieves serve as solid announcements, but he admits he has been heavily focused on hardware over the past few years since taking over the chief Xbox role",tech

"In a press release, the Prime Ministers office said the campaign aims to ensure that the internet cannot be used as a safe space for terrorists and criminals May and Macron will discuss the possibility of creating a new legal liability for tech companies if they fail to remove content, the UK release states, including potential fines",tech
"Leaders across Europe have pressured companies like Facebook, Twitter, and Google to more swiftly remove hate speech and terrorist material online, though there are concerns that aggressive legislation could infringe on free speech May called for stricter internet regulations following recent terrorist attacks in London and Manchester, and her government has criticized WhatsApp and other encrypted messaging services for providing terrorists with a secret place to communicateThe Prime Ministers office says France and the UK will work with tech companies to help curb terrorist content online and develop tools to identify and remove harmful material automatically",tech

"Well, where do you want to start? Judging by the trailer and brief press release, Monster Hunter World is the biggest overhaul yet for the series Its by far the most advanced on a technical level, and marks the first time that Capcom has developed a brand new Monster Hunter game for a system anywhere near this powerful  the original and 2 were on PS2 first, 3 came out on Wii, while 4 and Generations were developed for the 3DS (Im not counting the spin-off Monster Hunter Frontier MMOs)This doesnt just mean that World is the prettiest Monster Hunter yet, although it undoubtedly is  it means that Capcom has been able to change major elements of how the game plays World maps are no longer segmented, meaning you wont come across any loading times when transitioning from one area to the next; Capcom says the environments feature a living and breathing ecosystem that can be used to your advantage",tech
"But the biggest difference, at least in the trailer, comes down to style of play The trailer sees a solo player making his way through a level and using stealthy techniques to locate a monster, climb on it, and take it down, which is about as far from the typical Monster Hunter approach as you can get",tech
"Monster Hunter XX, the expanded version of Monster Hunter X (known as Monster Hunter Generations in the US), just came out for 3DS in Japan and will hit Switch later this year Its unclear whether it will see release elsewhere; Monster Hunter World, on the other hand, is the first game in the series with a simultaneous launch window In any case, its a major coup for SonyMonster Hunter isnt quite the sales juggernaut it once was in Japan, but if World turns out well it could be a serious system seller in its home market The PC and Xbox One versions arent coming to Japan at all, but neither platform has a big following in the country",tech
"Well, you should, because Japanese games are having a heck of a moment right now and that moment wont last too long if no-one in Japan is buying consoles",tech
"But even then, Monster Hunter World looks like the series best shot yet at Western success",tech
"Whatever happens, Monster Hunter World is one of the most surprising and intriguing announcements yet to come out of E3 2017 for anyone familiar with the series And that could soon apply to a whole lot more people around the world if what Capcoms planning works out Well bring you more coverage of Monster Hunter World later in the week; the game is due out globally in early 2018",tech
"When I reviewed the Sense sleep tracker and described it as only marginally better than a sham product, I felt bad Time has now validated my assessment, as Hello Inc, the company built around the Sense tracker as its sole product, is going under  but I still feel bad",tech
"The person announcing the shutdown of Hello, James Proud, is the young founder of a small team that led the company and its sleep-tracking gadget through a successful $24 million Kickstarter campaign, $105 million in Silicon Valley funding, and a subsequent $40 million funding round More than 19,000 backers bought into the Sense idea, so it was clearly hitting on a hot area of consumer interest and demand, however the one thing the company forgot to do was develop a robust device that actually did what it promisedWhat bums me out about the entire Sense saga is how calculated the whole thing felt and still feels",tech
"Current Sense users will be emailed instructions on how to export all of their data and delete their accounts, if they so wish, later this week Proud says there's still a chance that the Sense service will continue, however I've heard from someone familiar with goings-on behind the scenes that Hello has been unsuccessful in finding a takeover buyer and is now unable to even pay its bills",tech

"Late last month, The New York Times announced that it was doing away with its public editor position, a sort of ombudsman for the paper, in part because the role had been filled by reader comments on the internet The Times, publisher Arthur Sulzberger wrote in a memo, would be opening its comment sections on a greater number of stories and partnering with Google to manage them It would be a sea change in our ability to serve our readers, to hear from them, and to respond to them, Sulzberger wrote Today, the Times is unveiling the results of that partnership: an in-house process for automating comment moderation called ModeratorUntil recently, moderators for The New York Times would manually approve an average of 12,000 comments every day, with a team of 14 wading through reader responses as they came in",tech
"Like Perspective, Moderator charts comments based on their likelihood of being toxic or similar to comments previously flagged by moderators, creating a percentage score with the most likely to be flagged appearing closer to 100 percent",tech
"The Moderator announcement comes at a volatile time for comment sections around the internet Several prominent news organizations have axed them entirely, arguing that the cost of moderation is not worth the potential rewards Others have countered that comments are an essential reservoir of expertise, and that well-tended sections can build thoughtful audiencesMeanwhile, in the internet at large, there are still questions about how massive social media audiences should be moderated, and for the most part, they rely heavily on human judgment The Times is certainly a smaller, more special case  a paywalled news site  but the early success seems encouraging",tech

"The Surface Book was top heavy, chunky, and it had a removable screen that I rarely detached Like many Surface devices, it was different for the sake of being different, but it wasnt the ultimate laptop that Microsoft claimed it would beMicrosoft has now finally created the laptop Ive been waiting for, and its simply called the Surface Laptop The Laptop has virtually everything a working person could ask for, yet strangely, Microsoft has bundled the Surface Laptop with Windows 10 S, a new, slightly crippled version of Windows 10 that only supports apps from the Windows Store It cant run any apps downloaded from a website that a pro user might want, such as Adobe Creative Cloud, Steam, or VLC",tech
"I cant really get my work done without many of the apps I use daily, so I installed Windows 10 Pro on the Surface Laptop and have spent the last week using it as my main PC (For a look at the Surface Laptop with Windows 10 S, be sure to check out my colleague Dieter Bohns review) With Windows 10 Pro, the Surface Laptop has everything I want in a modern Windows laptop",tech
"Take wox, for example, it is a fully customizable desktop search tool like Alfred on the Mac and it's not available on Windows 10S",tech
"Amusingly, Im most impressed with the fact I can close the lid and it goes to sleep properly and the battery doesnt run down if I havent used it for 12 hours",tech
"The Surface Laptop isnt perfect and the alcantara fabric will be a risky decision, but it does manage to achieve something very Apple-like: desire",tech
"Finally It's a word that's famously overused in tech, and it's understandable As we use products every day, we can imagine that if just one or two small things changed, it would be perfect",tech
"But now, finally, Microsoft made a device that's not trying to be something new and weird, it's just trying to be the thing you want It's a laptop that's powerful enough to run all your apps, but thin enough to carry around  something with a high-resolution screen, a good keyboard, and a reasonable price It's the obvious thing to make, and so Microsoft gave it the obvious name: the Surface Laptop",tech
This review covers the Surface Laptop running Windows 10 S,tech
It's not entirely fair to say the Surface Laptop looks like an Air It comes in different colors! It has that fabric! But it's also totally fair: two of the three physical dimensions of the machine are nearly identical to the classic wedge shape we associate with the Air,tech
"To me, though, it doesn't matter that the Surface Laptop sort of looks like the Air",tech
"The Surface Laptop starts at $999, but I feel that exists more so that people will spend the extra $300 for the model I'm testing here, a Core i5 with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage It's the model I recommend if you decide to get this laptop",tech
"That combination of features means that unless you venture into serious gaming or video editing, you won't experience any regular slowdowns or hiccups",tech
"But again, choosing to go conservative with the design means that more people won't have to think through convoluted trade-offs when they're looking for a computer",tech
The big question is why Microsoft used this fabric in the first place,tech
"A small thing: the way that the fabric gets attached to the laptop means that there needs to be a small indentation around the edge of the laptop deck That, in turn, means that there's a tiny gap that runs around the seam of the laptop when it's closedI'll say this: I think using this fabric is an unforced error",tech
"The last thing everybody should know about the Surface Laptop: it ships with a new operating system called Windows 10 S I say it's ""new"" but that's not really true at all, because the only new thing here is that 10 S is locked down so it can only run apps downloaded from the official Microsoft Windows StoreThat limitation has a ton of benefits: it means that Microsoft can vet every app that goes on your machine for malware",tech
"Presumably, Microsoft is shipping Windows 10 S by default in an attempt to juice developers to get their apps into the store Maybe that strategy will work, but I am not optimistic",tech
"When I said up top that it doesn't matter that the Surface Laptop ships with Windows 10 S, this was what I meant The first or second time that the pop-up to switch to Pro appears, most regular users are just going to go ahead and click it (Students and other users in managed settings: sorry for your luck)Be warned, however, that for now there's no going back to Windows 10 S without completely reformatting your machineOne small note for potential Mac switchers: even though I find many of the third-party apps on Windows deficient compared to their Mac equivalents, the gap is closing",tech
"The Surface Laptop totally lives up to expectationsI think it's the new de facto Windows laptop that most people who want a Windows laptop should get  provided they can afford to spend $1,300 for the step-up model",tech
"To tell the truth, I don't know that there's some sort of incredible technical achievement here It's thin but not that thin, powerful but not wildly so Microsoft just chose to do the obvious and correct thing with this laptop over and over, even if that thing is a little boring",tech
"But the other expectation I had for the Surface Laptop is that I'd be unable to actually get the apps I need from the Windows Store, and I was right If you buy this laptop, you're going to end up taking the upgrade to Windows 10 Pro",tech
There are thinner Windows laptops,tech

"There are three main factors to take under consideration when youre in the market for a mechanical watch: style, dial, and price",tech
"After you figure out the materials you want in your watch, the next step is choosing the dial There are a ton of options here to choose from, with a number of complications like the date, secondhand sub-dials, time zones, chronographs, tourbillions, Moon phases, and so onPerhaps none of these things are going to be crucial to you, unless you have a specific reason why youre buying a watch",tech
"If this is your first watch, something more minimal with sleek hands that can be worn in any environment may be more appealing If you have a piece like that already, or if you want a more advanced timepiece, a more complicated watch like a chronograph could be the way to go",tech
"The price wont determine what features you can get in your watch, but it will determine the quality of the materials, construction, and the legacy of the timepiece you choose",tech
"Sure, you can buy an Invicta off of Amazon for around $100 that will look relatively similar to a Rolex or a Hublot to the untrained eye But if you do that, youre getting gold paint instead of solid gold, a mass-produced movement instead of Rolexs in-house option, and it definitely wont be handmade",tech
Theres also the country of origin to take into consideration,tech
"Once you know what type of watch you want, buying your piece is the last step I recommend going straight to the watchmakers store if possible If that isnt an option for you, check the watchmakers website for authorized resellers near youThe resale market may also come into play if youre looking for something like a vintage Rolex at an affordable price (A used Rolex can range from $4,000 to well over $100,000 depending on the model",tech

"Anyone who has watched even isolated clips from The Bachelor or The Bachelorette can glean that it is an environment that makes otherwise normal people behave very strangely The more savvy, dedicated viewer can identify week six as the usual tipping point where contestants go from having fun to crying at the slightest provocation, or threatening to punch someone at the slightest provocation, or doing bad karaoke, or getting naked, or trying to choke out the Bachelor at the slightest provocationIts well known that the contestants have limited access to phones and the internet while theyre on the show, in part so that they dont inadvertently spoil things and in part so that the producers can more convincingly orchestrate truly bananas scenarios in which the contestants stumble upon tabloids, consume them ravenously, and then freak out about their contents",tech
"But just how limited is their access to media? As it turns out: so limited I can barely believe it These guys and gals essentially sit in an enormous mansion (or various far-flung hotel rooms) all day for two months, with nothing to entertain them but their own thoughts and their competitors in the sport of love It is a torture scenario derived from No Exit, and it thoroughly explains how stuff like this happens:For starters, I asked the expert on all things The Bachelor and The Bachelor spinoffs, Reality Steve (a blogger who regularly knows the winner of a given season before it even starts airing), to fill me in He said, to his knowledge, the only access to media the contestants ever have would be music, limited to flights between destination dates Even then, as he has pointed out on his extremely popular blog, its case by case, and at the whims of the producers",tech
They want their full focus 24/7 to be on the guy Hence the reason you get so many meltdowns[,tech
"So I took my question to the people who would know the restrictions of Bachelor Nation better than anyone: the contestants They had varying accounts, which makes it seem as though the rules have changed over time, sometimes flip-flopping illogically",tech
"Adams said contestants on his season of The Bachelorette were allowed to watch Interstellar in a hotel in Uruguay None of the other contestants I spoke to remembered being permitted to watch a movie, though Tasos Hernandez, a contestant on Andi Dorfmans 2014 season of The Bachelorette and the first season of Bachelor in Paradise, said that the restrictions on television were relaxed toward the end of his time on the former show He said contestants were occasionally permitted to watch TV in hotel rooms between destination dates",tech
"According to contestants, the rules around music have changed a lot, though not with any obvious progression In general, the conditions for listening to music seem to be determined by individual producers, not the basic rules of the showLiCausi said her phone was held by a chaperone the entire time she was on the 2013 season of The Bachelor, but during flights and car rides some producers would lend iPads or iPods to contestants so they could listen to music: The producers obligation was to keep us from being distracted from life itself and focus on what we were there for, to meet our future husband",tech
"Hernandez said iPods and books were both allowed on his 2014 season, But whenever we were all together and filming we were not allowed to read or listen to music",tech
"Maguire added, If youre sitting in a group, they wont let you have headphones in The number one reason is that they want everyone to engage with each other, they want everyone to be talking They want dialogue and talking and discussion and that kind of stuff, they dont want people to go off and listen to music",tech
"I asked Maguire if he thought this inability to seek private moments contributed to the drama on The Bachelorette or Bachelor in Paradise, reasoning that being forced to stay put and continue an uncomfortable conversation might escalate tense situations",tech
"In any case, the rules around music seem to have swung back to Draconian measures in the last year Fransway said contestants on her 2017 season of The Bachelor werent allowed any personal electronic devices, including music players: We did always look forward to car rides when leaving home base because that would mean we did get to listen to music! We would only have to film for the first ten minutes when in transport and then we could listen to the music and dance during the car ride!Most of the contestants I spoke to didnt remember being informed of any world or national news as a group",tech
"Nick Vialls season of The Bachelor filmed during the end of the 2016 election season Fransway said that contestants were provided with absentee ballots, adding, The producers did keep us updated on what was going on with that if we wanted any informationMost access to media while filming the show seems to be granted via personal favors from producers",tech
"On JoJo Fletchers 2016 season, contestants coincidentally happened upon some tabloids about her and an ex-boyfriend in a barber shop in Uruguay They were in English, mysteriously, though they served no purpose in particular other than making JoJo cry and giving the men an opportunity to virtue signal Other than these expertly timed run-ins with the edge of the reality TV bubble, it seems ABC milks most of its drama out of contestants by setting them into a world apart, and providing little opportunity to step away from intense feelings",tech

"If you missed the original Ooblets announcement, the game is basically a three-way cross between Pokmon, Harvest Moon, and Animal Crossing As the trailer shows, instead of going out into the world and capturing Ooblets in battle, youll nurture and grow them in your garden Your Ooblets can then battle other Ooblets in turn-based combat, similar to the Pokmon games, and, as the new trailer shows off, youll also be able to collect items and decorate your house while interacting with characters in your neighborhood",tech
"But the charm of Ooblets doesnt just stem from its mix of classic game mechanisms  its the style of the game that makes Ooblets great, with everything rendered in colorful pastels and an aesthetic that can only be described as incredibly cute While Ooblets is getting published by Double Fine, the game is almost entirely the work just two developers: Rebecca Cordingley (who does the art and programming) and Ben Wasser (game design and writing) Cordingley is also running a Patreon for fans who want to more directly support and keep up with the development of the game",tech

"A few people were spoiling to take the alt-right / antifa street fights of the past few months onlineBut whos serious here? To some extent it doesnt matter  an ironic Nazi is still a Nazi But Poes Law is out in full force, so things that seem like obvious mockeries of the alt-right get taken for the real article as well",tech
"Fortunately, some people got on the same Nazi-killing page after a while",tech
"This confusion matters, because people use these comments to gauge the influence of the alt-right, and a parody that falls flat isnt the same as someone using its a joke to say something they really believe When I went to check a comment calling Nazis a bunch of people you disagree with, I saw a follow-up apparently disavowing the statement  both posts seem to have disappeared since then, so Ive followed up with the user on Reddit to clarifyAnd not every dumb statement about Nazis is part of a white supremacist resurgence Never mind Nazis, what about communism? isnt an alt-right position, its an embarrassingly canned old-school conservative talking point And, as another commenter points out, not a great one in video games",tech
"Even the replies from apparent national socialists are more complicated than Bethesda made the alt-right mad Nazis have guilty pleasures, too, I guessSometimes you find a little oasis of meaningful criticism, like this takedown of Nazis having a monopoly on national prideAnd the vast majority of people who responded to Pepe Von Europa found him ridiculousBut really, the best lesson you can take out of the past days of Wolfenstein commentary is that most people arent Nazis, which is a depressingly low bar",tech
Were hoping to get a chance to try Wolfenstein II at E3 Hopefully well find fighting the Nazis there a lot more satisfying,tech

"No matter how bad the PR gets for Uber, consumers don't seem to care, Tusk told The Verge in an email, and Lyft still can't catch upIts not for lack of trying, though: Lyft continues to capitalize on Ubers slow implosion by locking down a series of deals with major tech and auto companies Its image as the safe, friendly alternative to Uber has helped it score a number of crucial investments for a valuation of around $7 billion",tech
"Harry Campbell, a former Uber driver and blogger at The Rideshare Guy, agreed that as long as the companys main product, its ride-hailing app, continues to outperform rival apps, the company will continue to dominate the market All of the bad press Uber is getting may hurt morale internally and complicate short-term efforts but riders are still getting from point A to point B safely and for a low price, Campbell said",tech

"Similar anti-theft measures do exist for laptops, but theyre not as precise as trackers like Roambee or as widely adopted as phone-tracking features Laptop-tracking programs usually rely on the internet, and only work when the computer is connected That makes the signal more erratic, and gives criminals a lot more time to wipe the device",tech

"I saw that you tweeted something at Flickr, is that another rivalry?Its not so much a rivalry, its just a regret Theres this whole generation of startups that got bought at the same time by Yahoo",tech

"Ironically, Sony spent the past year learning the problem with technically Technically, its PS4 Pro is superior to the more affordable PS4 Slim, but that depends on the game youre playing, whether its developer has provided additional patches and optimization, and if that patch is even available at the time you play that game And though each PS4 Pro-optimized game is technically better than the same experience on PS4 Slim, the improvements are unique from game to game: some upgrade resolution and increase frame rate, others add additional post-processing",tech
"Ultimately, if Microsoft wants to leverage the Xbox One X to not just live alongside PS4 Pro, but challenge it, the company needs to find a way to get customers to care about the nitty gritty of resolution and graphicsAnd is that really the direction Microsoft and Sony want to go? Encouraging their player-base to obsess over graphical minutiae? If so, I suspect Microsoft and Sony may find themselves fighting not against each other but the rise of PC gaming The companies already offer excellent, comparably affordable consoles",tech

"We're just over a week away from the unveiling of this year's iteration from OnePlus, the OnePlus 5, and my excitement for it is building due to two related reasons: 2017 has so far been a weird year for phones, with a bunch of basic usability issues cropping up, but I have the sense that OnePlus will be the one company to overcome those problems and just deliver an uncomplicated, good Android smartphone Like it's always done In other words, my biggest wish with regard to the OnePlus 5 is for OnePlus to not shoot itself in the footBut let's run through a few of the missteps I've noticed this year and the opportunity they allow for OnePlus:Table stakes for any smartphone since the latter half of 2015, the fingerprint reader has gone through many variations and iterations, and it has almost inevitably been spoiled by companies overthinking the whole thingThe worst offender on this front in 2017 has without doubt been Samsung, with its offset, rear-mounted fingerprint scanner on the Galaxy S8",tech

"A little more than a year after Apple released the 97-inch iPad Pro, its replacing it with a new model, the iPad Pro 105",tech
"And yet, despite the fact that the meaningful tablet market has dwindled down to some Window 10 devices and the iPad  and despite the fact that the iPad itself has seen slowing sales  the companys engineers are still moving full speed ahead and putting the most advanced technical hardware features it can come up with into this device Apple is basically showing off at this pointExcept for one thing: this iPad wasnt built for today",tech
"Apple has definitively made clear what the differences are between a regular iPad and an iPad Pro Those differences include a murderers row of specs that dont seem very necessary for what most people do with iPads Here is what makes an iPad Pro, Pro: a bigger, better screen; a faster, more powerful processor; better cameras; support for the Apple Pencil; a keyboard connection port; and more speakers",tech
"Theres one more difference, though, and its the biggest and most important one: the price",tech
"Compare that with the regular iPad, which starts at $329 and is perfectly good at what most people do with iPads: read, watch some movies, check email, browse the web, play some games, and so onAdd it all up and its not just laptop territory, its premium, top-of-the-line laptop territory And If youre looking at the larger, 12",tech
"If that was all Apple had done, Id be sitting here telling you that this is an incredible display and also telling you not to worry that the slightly-higher 2224 x 1668 resolution means some older apps will have to upscale a tiny bit Id probably also mention that Apple has increased the max brightness to a very high 600 nits But of course, thats not all Apple has done",tech
"The new feature that matters on this display is that its capable of a refresh rate of 120Hz, which is twice what most mobile devices are capable of That sentence is as nerdy as it sounds, but stay with me for a second on this one The refresh rate is how quickly the pixels on the screen get redrawn when you scroll or when something moves on a screen 120Hz  means that when you scroll, theres less lag when the pixels moveReducing lag is important because the obvious goal for any tablet screen is to make the stuff that appears on screen sort of feel like actual physical things youve moving around",tech
There are other practical benefits,tech

"With iOS 11, the core UI of how iPad multitasking works is going to completely change The dock of apps at the bottom will be available with a swipe up from anywhere",tech
"I am hopeful that the sum of all these operating system changes will add up to a significantly more powerful experience of using the iPad Pro as a computer, not just for iPad things Make no mistake, the iPad and iPad Pro are already computers and perfectly capable of doing computer things But because iOS got its start by trying to simplify away things like files systems and windows, it involves too many tricky workarounds compared to the way most of us understand how to use traditional computersI dont think iOS 11 is going to turn the iPad into something like a Mac or a Windows PC, with all their customization options and apps that plug deep into the system Yet I do think it will unlock opportunities for both users and developers that arent there today",tech
"Now that we know that the 105-inch iPad Pro is an impressive device and that we further know that iOS 11 is going to radically change how you use it, lets get back to that value equation I mentioned earlier Basically, should you buy it? The iPad Pro 105 presents a conundrum: it is a stupendous device that I firmly believe most people shouldnt buy just yetTo me, if youre going to spend $650 on a computer, it should almost surely be your main computer",tech

"That special work might not always be very clear, but Microsoft expects dozens of titles to be updated and enhanced for the Xbox One X Microsoft is using three logos in total for new Xbox One games, including the enhanced logo, a 4K indicator, and a symbol for HDR support The 4K support will mean a game has a 2160p frame buffer output, that includes Native 4K, Checkerboarding, and Dynamic Resolution HDR support is just the regular HDR10 standard that already exists on the Xbox One SEnhanced for Xbox One X will be the slightly more confusing out of all three logos, as developers can choose from a range of ways to improve their games for the new console",tech

"Lees small character team has funneled a ton of effort into creating absurd levels of detail for the now more prominent driver, by building out a catalog of racing suits, helmets, gloves, and more The game has over 300 character designs, and about a week or more of work went into each There are female and male models, and different silhouettes, or body types, for both, each of which took around five weeks to design",tech
"Whats more, each one of the five discrete pieces that makes up a character (the helmet, the suit, etc",tech
That might sound like a strange amount of attention spent on something you wont see much of while youre racing,tech
"Characters will also show up at the ends of races, podium-style, with the winner front and center looking proud, and the third-place finisher turned slightly away from the camera as if theyre already plotting revenge Your characters look will even now represent you when you show up in friends games as drivatars, a feature introduced back in Forza 5",tech
"Players will be able to choose between everything from real race suits with HANS devices, to old-timey outfits with leather helmets, to some even goofier additions from pop culture (Expect a lot of era-specific inside jokes, Lee laughs There's a lot of middle-aged people that work here) With Forza featuring real racing series like IndyCar and NASCAR, you can also expect to see some more iconic suits as well, set to be announced later this summerWhile diehard fans are always going to want more cars and tracks, the game has long passed the point where it lacked in either of those departments",tech
"I think [the characters] might be the coolest opportunity for us to really kind of depart from Forzas in the past, Lee says, though he admits it wont be as deep as the character creation tools in other sports games",tech
"Looks are a huge part of Forza, but you dont play racing games on mute Sound is crucial to an immersive experience, and so even Chase Combs, the games audio director, has spent the last two years trying to find ways to make Forza 7 grab the attention of your ears as much as your eyes That starts with abandoning the sweeping cinematic score of Forza 6 in favor of a soundtrack you might mistake for whats found in modern-day beer commercials",tech
"We ended up kind of going with something that felt a little more rooted in what you might hear in a garage, you know? That automotive spirit, Combs saysBut Combs and his team went further than just shifting genres",tech
"Go from the main menus to the garage to start tuning one of your cars, and suddenly the music sounds like its coming from a radio on the other side of the room Hop into Forzavista mode, get in the car, and it will muffle",tech
"A goal of mine, Combs says, was to make [the music] a character in the game, not just something that we lay on top of the game and people kind of turn off",tech
"Its a slick effect, but music is less than half the battle when it comes to the sound of a racing game The cars need to sound as real as they look, tooWe think audio is critical component of that sense of speed and the kind of violent or exciting nature of racing",tech
"The end result is a game that sounds remarkably lifelike without all the different layers  the screaming engines, squealing tires, doors slamming, and the rock soundtrack  muddying each other up You can hear the air being sucked into the engine at the same time that, say, your tires hit the gravel when you slip off the curbing of a track",tech
"Combs has a switch on his desk that he can flip to funnel the sound through two desktop speakers, and that his team will often head out to one of the common areas and use the TVs there",tech
Adding customizable characters and doing tricky things with the sound might seem ancillary to the core Forza experience,tech

"But take the marshmallow out of the heat, and itll deflate  although the stretched out gelatin doesnt bounce back",tech
"Well, maybe not burnt  but definitely toasted Heating the marshmallow over the fire can make the sugar caramelize, a chemical reaction that produces the brown color and toasted flavor",tech
"When the sugar gets hot enough, it starts to break down into smaller molecules that then react with one another These reactions produce new fruity, nutty, and buttery flavors you can taste and smell on your toasted marshmallow",tech
"Certain sugars may also react with amino acids in the gelatin in whats known as the Maillard reaction It occurs at much lower temperatures than caramelization and contributes to the rich brown color and complex flavors of a seared steak, roasted coffee, or caramel candies For marshmallows that are very slowly roasted, Hartel suspects that the Maillard reaction might be whats producing their golden hue and general deliciousness",tech
"Marshmallows start to melt when they heat up to just above body temperature, Hartings says But if youre not careful, you can completely burn the outside before the inside even gets warm The heat of the fire shakes loose the chemical bonds in the gelatin that hold the candy together, which makes the marshmallow ooze",tech
"So, whether you prefer marshmallows golden brown or charbroiled, dont catch them on fire immediately if you want to maximize the gooeyness You've gotta be patient and slow for a while (letting the meltiness reach all the way to the insides) Then, Hartings says, you can torch the sucker",tech

"I will concede that Wavebox feels almost tailor-made for my personal work and life setup We here at The Verge use Trello for tracking projects, communicate over Slack, and use Google Cloud / G Suite for all of our email and web app needs Though there is support for Windows apps now, I can see why some peoples workflows might not mesh well with what Wavebox has to offerAnd to be fair, this isnt a minimalist and uncluttered email app  far from it If you want something a bit more minimal, Airmail is probably your best bet, but Id also highly recommend the web app Mailplane, especially if you want the same web Gmail experience replicated as a lightweight Mac app",tech

"This is an exciting year for Formula E and a great time to start watching the young series, because big names like Jaguar and BMW have joined an already competitive field The greater push toward electric vehicles has caused major automakers to either flock to the series or express their interest",tech
"Channel 5 owns the UK broadcast rights this season, and the race can be seen live on both Saturday and Sunday afternoons at 2:30PM BST there",tech
"Outside of certain countries (like the US), Formula E streams its races on its website and mobile app for free",tech
But there are important differences in Formula E that set it apart,tech
One of the most unique aspects of Formula E is that almost every race takes place on a temporary street circuit in or near the center of a major city,tech
"The series has already pulled off races in cities like Paris, Berlin, London, Miami, and Long Beach",tech
"There are a few reasons for racing in cities First and foremost, its a promotional tool If you can pull off a race in the middle of a city, youre bound to attract more attention from outside the motorsport world than you would at a track thats miles away",tech
"Formula E is like other racing series at a very high level, but the actual racing is distinct, because the drivers arent always pushing the cars as hard as they possibly can",tech
There are some huge automotive names involved with Formula E already,tech
"But this is electric racing, so wheres Tesla?The thinking is that all these other companies are just starting to explore electric vehicles, so they are interested in Formula E because it can help lay some technical and philosophical foundation when it comes to developing an EV",tech
"The short race length is also out of the seriess hands right now, since the batteries in the cars are only currently capable of lasting around 25 minutes under the stress of the race",tech
Heres the thing though: its fine! The car swaps take about a minute but they are otherwise no different from a pit stop,tech
"One of the most talked-about aspects of Formula E when it was created was Fanboost, a fan voting contest held before each race that awards the winning drivers an extra boost of power that they can use in the race",tech

"Apple relies on mobile modems from both Qualcomm and Intel, but only Qualcomms X16 LTE modem is currently capable of gigabit internet speeds",tech
"The end result is that Apple will ship devices with both Qualcomm and Intel modems, but refuse to enable the faster speeds on the Qualcomm devices This is because Apple doesnt want to bifurcate its user base into those with faster speeds and those with standard LTE connections, Bloomberg reports, while it also moves to undermine Qualcomms dominance in the mobile marketThis could all be a moot point: theres no telling when AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile, or Sprint will be able to confidently say theyre providing gigabit speeds to customers Without the actual network coverage, having a faster smartphone modem wont mean anything, and customers certainly wont know the difference As it stands, all four networks are racing to be the first to blanket the US with faster versions of LTE, yet what that rollout ends up looking like is still unclear",tech

"Youre no stranger to living in cold environments, since youve also spent time as an ice driller in Antarctica How was that experience?Antarctica is, Id say, the most off-planet experience you can probably have on the planet I was in two different places down there, once working deep in the interior in a place called the West Antarctic Ice Sheet And its like being out on the ocean there Its flat, white, no topology and its mind blowing",tech
And the other region that I was in is a place called the Taylor Glacier [which is on a dry valley],tech
"What did you work on at SpaceX?The majority of my time  its really been spread out while Ive been there  Ive done some design and analysis of various components on the first stage of Falcon 9 Some of those components, even though they started flying back on flight six, a few of them actually still flyAnd then in the last year and a half, Ive been running whats called the launch chief engineering group, which is part of flight reliability",tech
"How long have you been applying to be an astronaut and what was the process like?So this is the third time Ive applied The first time I knew I was probably borderline not qualified, but I wanted to give it a shot to see how it goes The second time I did actually get invited in and made it to the final 50",tech
You are obviously a big ocean buff Where did you get your love of studying marine ecology?Im a microbiologist by training I first got into biology as a high school student,tech
It seems like going to Antarctica is a theme in this astronaut class Robb Kulin also spent time there and said it was almost like being off the planet What was the experience like for you?It was a blast,tech
And that wound up being a project called Pavilion Lake,tech
So when did you turn your eye from the oceans to space?I cant ever say Ive turned my eyes away from the ocean Thats still very much a part of my research and who I am But it was sometime during college that I really realized I had accumulated this set of applicable skills,tech

"But even if this just means Apple is going to focus on gamers with affordable, VR-friendly computers, I won't be madTaylor Swifts entire catalogue is back on Spotify",tech
"In a now-infamous essay for The Wall Street Journal, Swift wrote:""Music is art, and art is important and rare Important, rare things are valuable Valuable things should be paid for It's my opinion that music should not be free, and my prediction is that individual artists and their labels will someday decide what an album's price point is""The thrust of this argument takes a few things for granted that werent true, even in 2014: For one, that Swift could use her personal situation as a standard by which to  gauge the industrys dealings with artists",tech
"RelatedShe, and other top artists, stand to make millions of dollars from streaming no matter what happens, and Spotify and Apple Music even push them further ahead of the crowd by way of recommendation algorithms, featured playlists, and paid exclusives",tech
"Whether or not Swifts stance on Spotify made sense, its obviously just glad to have her back, and no longer interested in going toe-to-toe",tech
"When Apple announced three-month free trials to users willing to give Apple Music a go, and quietly told labels that artists wouldnt be seeing any royalties for those streams, Swift took to Tumblr to express her displeasure:I find it to be shocking, disappointing, and completely unlike this historically progressive and generous companyThis is not about me Thankfully I am on my fifth album and can support myself, my band, crew, and entire management team by playing live shows This is about the new artist or band that has just released their first single and will not be paid for its success This is about the young songwriter who just got his or her first cut and thought that the royalties from that would get them out of debt",tech
I realize that Apple is working towards a goal of paid streaming,tech
"Apple acquiesced to Swifts demand, and agreed to pay royalties to everyone during its free trial",tech
"She also took care to note that 1989 was not an Apple Music exclusive in any contractual sense, she just didnt want to put the album on any other services yet",tech
"RelatedWhatever nitpicks Swift might have had with the basic concept of streaming in 2014, they were seemingly all behind her at this point",tech
"The new deal between UMG and Spotify allows for artists to choose to window new albums (or make them unavailable to free users) for up to two weeks after their initial release  a huge win for the label, and a sticking point for Swift Streams from paid users pay far better than streams from ad-supported users on Spotify, and Swift is nothing if not fully in control of her content and her finances",tech
The experiment isnt an experiment anymore,tech
"In 2016, streaming became the dominant revenue driver for the music industry  when 1989 was released, it made up 27 percent of the revenue",tech
"Make no mistake, Swift is one of the shrewdest businesspeople in the music industry, and she will get every dollar shes earned But in 2017, keeping your catalog off streaming services wont help you maximize your earning potential or appease your fansYou could argue Swift won both of her corporate fights in the music industry",tech
"While Spotify may have lost the initial battle, it didnt lose the war, and frankly neither did Swift This is a calculated armistice that allows both sides to retreat to their base and claim victory 1989 is finally on the worlds largest streaming service, and Swift will get paid more and have more control over her content going forward",tech
"The real winner here is the Swift fans and Spotify users, who can finally listen to the most popular artist in the US without hassleDont try to wrong a raven, not even once Its not going to forget and its probably going to shun you for a long timeWhen it comes to animal personalities, there are dogs, which are loyal and usually love you no matter what And on the other side are ravens, who are only too happy to remember what you look like and ostracize you,  according to a study published this week in the journal Animal Behavior",tech
"These nine ravens were raised in captivity, growing to become familiar with the researchers",tech
"Two days later, the researcher rounded up up seven of the birds and presented them with three trainers: the fair one who gave them the bread, the unfair one who ate food in front of them, and a neutral one Six out of seven birds chose the fair one One chose the neutral one Nobody wanted to play with the mean oneOne month later, they tested all nine birds",tech

So who exactly is Arms for? Here are a few potential candidates,tech
Think of Arms as the fighting game equivalent of Mario Kart: a multiplayer game that just about anyone can pick up and have fun with right away (Arms was actually developed by the same team behind the excellent Mario Kart 8,tech
"While it takes practice to get good at Arms, you dont need to be especially great to hop in and have fun This is especially true of the two-on-two mode, where a more experienced player can partner up with a newbie to even things outFor all of its accessibility, part of what makes Arms so enjoyable is its freedom of movement",tech
"Things get even more complex when you factor in the differences between characters Each of the 10 combatants has a distinct way of moving and special abilities that dramatically alters the way they fight After playing for a week, Im still not sure who I like best",tech
"That said, for all of its depth, Arms is very different from most fighting games It still requires fast reflexes and quick thinking, but theres no memorization of complex combos or advanced control schemes to worry aboutA few months after launch, the Switch has a fairly solid line-up of games, from smaller gems like Tumbleseed and Puyo Puyo Tetris, to ports of big hits like Minecraft and Mario Kart 8 But even still, many Switch owners are looking for something new to play  particularly those who have managed to make it all the way through Breath of the WildArms is a great game, but depending on the kind of experience youre looking for, it might not satisfy that post-Zelda itch",tech
"Of course, this is true of most competitive games Mario Kart gets pretty boring when you play by yourself But Arms feels especially sparse, especially when you look at the upcoming Splatoon 2, which retains a multiplayer focus but adds in what looks to be a fairly robust single-player campaign as well",tech
Arms launches on Nintendo Switch on June 16th,tech

"While Voliros main selling point is those sweet, tiltable axes, it says the hexacopter will also eventually have a center sphere (so it can roll omnidirectionally on the ground) The axes should also give it the ability to fly with aerial stability in any configuration with 12 degrees of freedomIt remains to be seen if Voliros acrobatic drone will ever go to market, but in the meantime, its a ton of fun to watch",tech

"Its not just imagination: a lot of whiskies really are very similar, and the average person probably cant tell one from another For a study published today in the journal Chem, scientists tried to develop a way to distinguish whiskey at the chemical level So, they created sensors that work just like the different taste receptors on a tongue, and used them to differentiate more than 30 different whiskies",tech
"Our tongues have different receptors for different flavors  like sweet versus salty versus bitter When you eat something, the molecules in the food interact with the different receptors to create the overall taste of a pickle, or Dijon mustardThe research teams sensors dont look like a tongue, but they work the same way",tech
"Next, Bunz used a machine called a plate reader to measure exactly how much the whiskies changed the solution From this, they found a unique pattern of intensities for each of the different whiskies You can even discriminate Irish whiskies from Scotch-blended, and single malt from double malt, says Bunz",tech

"The company intends to roll out disaster maps for use by governments and additional organizations in the future, promising that all applications will be reviewed carefully by people at Facebook, including those with local expertise",tech
"Its clear that Facebook has a wealth of data on users who agree to use the service, and   while the announcement of sharing more user information can raise hackles for some, for now we have to take its word that the data is being shared as stated, and will help those at their most vulnerableTidal and Sprint are releasing an exclusive film starring Mahershala Ali, Lupita Nyongo, and Danny Glover called 4:44 Tidal aired an ad during the NBA finals revealing the project, which has been teased around the web through enigmatic adsFew other details have been provided about 4:44 The film is NC-17; the moody black-and-white trailer features Mahershala Ali wailing on a punching bag in a slow-mo training montage",tech

"Though Apple didn't have much to say about HomeKit during its keynote presentation on Monday, it turns out the company's smart home system is seeing some very notable changes this year The updates center on two things: making HomeKit more flexible for users, and making it much easier for developers to start building new products",tech

"Middle-earth: Shadow of War has a new story trailer that focuses less on showing off gameplay and more on setting the stage for the new chapter in Talion and Celebrimbors adventureWhere the first game tried to position itself as a potential lost chapter of a story that could fit in the cracks between Tolkiens existing books, Shadow of War seems to be throwing out a strict adherence to the canon in favor of tossing in everything but the kitchen sink Which, by and large, feels like a good thing: it gives the game more room to tell its own story without feeling weighed down by the constraints of the existing canon",tech

"My first reaction to Apple's WWDC announcement of iOS drag and drop was basically, ""Lol welcome to three decades ago"" But after watching a more in-depth technical explanation of the technology at Apple's follow-up Platforms State of the Union, I'm starting to wonder if Apple has a new pinch to zoom on its hands: a technology that doesn't just allow for multitouch devices to compete with point-and-click desktop experiences, but in a way, it surpasses themiOSs drag and drop from a users perspective is fairly simple",tech
One demo Apple provided is on the familiar iOS home screen,tech
"According to Apples documentation, you can actually have multiple of these drag activities going on at once As many as the users fingers can handle, is the official spec, which sounds bonkers",tech
"Multi-grab makes iOS drag and drop stand out, but it's Apple's APIs that could make it even more powerful It's all thanks to the blessing and curse of iOS: Apple's stranglehold control on how apps talk to each other in the operating system To make an item available for drag and drop, developers have to implement a specific API from Apple, which allows them to specify thumbnails, metadata, and the exact data payload When a user hovers an item or a collection of items over another app, that app can see the metadata, but not the actual payload, for security reasons But the ability to use metadata hints and arbitrary data formats in a drag-and-drop interaction could unlock really interesting new inter-app workflows and interactions",tech
"For instance, dragging a location from Maps includes a detailed thumbnail preview, which will show up when you drop that location into an app that supports images  like Notes, for instance That sort of expansion is a common feature in apps like Messages or Slack, but now its baked into a very basic part of the UI",tech
"Adobe gave a demonstration where a presenter selected a few color samples and a brush from the companys Capture app and placed them into Photoshop Sketch, all in one drag-and-drop operation The presenter then grabbed multiple layers from Sketch and placed them into Photoshop Mix",tech
"Maybe you could drag a video file from an editing app into an app that only accepts images and get the video's thumbnail, or drop it into an audio app and extract the audio Or drag a file from Dropbox and drop it as a URL in an app that doesn't support that kind of file Apple has already shown interoperability between data-rich Calendar items and Reminders Obviously, Adobe is using custom layer and brush data formats to make it easier to jump between its own iOS apps, but conceivably any other design app could implement support for these data typesMaybe Im overhyping this",tech
"That leaves HomePod in a weird place On paper, it combines the great audio and multi-room music of a Sonos speaker with the smarts of an Amazon Echo or Google Home But, while the HomePod may be able to do both of those things, Apples speaker is shaping up to be a jack-of-all-trades compromise that ultimately is a master of none",tech
"Put simply: in its current state, HomePod is not competitive with Alexa or the Google Assistant Siri, as a digital assistant, lacks the intelligence or functionality that its competitors have to offer",tech
"It's no surprise that Apple has chosen to put music as the primary sell for HomePod, because without an actual serious investment in building out Siri as a platform  which Apple seems reticent to do  there's no way it can win from the home assistant angleAmazon and Google are willing to throw caution to the wind and let users put whatever they want on their Echo and Home There are thousands of Alexa skills available for the Echo, allowing you to do everything from getting news, to checking your bank account balance, to playing Jeopardy",tech
"HomePod, on the other hand, supports Apple Music, full stop, plus whatever you can stream from an iPhone over AirPlay 2 Multi-room support is limited to more $350 HomePods, or whatever AirPlay 2 speakers get released, but there doesn't seem to be a plan for a Google Chromecast Audio or even an AirPort Extreme type of a solution to add AirPlay 2 to older speakers Plus, as a single wireless speaker, HomePod is more expensive than any comparable product on the market, including Sonos, a company that has almost always been synonymous with pricey hardwareThe HomePod is a distillation of Apples approach to technology, seen in everything from iOS to Siri Its a set it and forget it product  you plug it in, and Apples algorithms, microphones, and APIs do the rest, tuning the sound and configuring things for you",tech
"But the Apple Watch also showed that a tight integration with Apples other products isnt quite enough  no one views the Watch as a revolutionary device that changes the way we live, like the iPhone or the iPod were",tech
"When I first heard about the Astell & Kern Kann, I guffawed at its size and price",tech
"But here's the eyebrow-raising conclusion I've come to after using the Kann for more than a month: it all makes sense There's nothing excessive about this device, not even its price, and it's all because of the way it actually works The A&K Kann is the very definition of function-first design",tech
"Astell & Kern Kann specs4-inch WVGA (800 x 480) display64GB of built-in storage, expandable via MicroSD and full-size SD cardsWAV, FLAC, WMA, MP3, OGG, APE, AAC, ALAC, AIFF, DFF, DSF, PCM, DSD80211b/g/n Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 40, AptX HD supportAKM AK4490 digital-to-analog converter6,200mAh batteryUSB-C and MicroUSB ports3",tech
"My standard for any audio equipment that makes claims of superior sound quality is that the superiority has to be obvious Don't tell me to sit in the absolute center of my sound-dampened, specially rearranged living room just to get a sense of your exemplary speakers' performance For the lofty prices usually asked, audiophile equipment should be obviously better",tech
"My happy experience with the legendary rockers and the good but not exceptional MSR7s was only reaffirmed and amplified by expanding into other genres and other sets of headphones When I stepped up to the Beyerdynamic Xelento in-ears, which are themselves priced at $999, it all got too much for me I literally didn't want to move from my seat, even though this is an obviously portable music combo, because I was so transfixed by the music the Xelento and Kann were producing together",tech
"So yes, the Kann scales up in quality if you plug higher-end gear into it, but I found it superb even with the more affordable Shure SE535 in-ears and Oppo PM3 over-ear headphones With the PM3s, I loved the natural instrumentation of Nitin Sawhney's Displacing the Priest, which definitely benefited from the Kann's expanded soundstage and seemingly boundless dynamic range",tech
"I could stop with its world-beating sound, but the Kann has other good things going for it This player's ratcheted volume dial is a tactile delight, clicking with a mechanical noise that makes it feel like unlocking a combination lock Yeah, I know, it seems like an unimportant little thing, but I've handed the Kann to dozens of people and they've all wanted to have that dial in their lives in some form It's a built-in ASMR trigger (or perhaps the sophisticated audiophile's fidget spinner) One smartphone designer I spoke to expressed deep frustration at the constraints of his trade preventing him from putting something as mechanically pleasing as the Kann's jog dial in his designs",tech
"Also awesome: the Kann's battery life It lasted me a full working week in the Bay Area while covering Google I/O last month, and it still had enough juice to cover my six-hour flight to New York on the Saturday A major problem holding back other good-sounding PMPs in the Kann's vicinity is that they try to be slim and run out of battery too quickly",tech
Almost,tech
"The Kann may be an exceptional new breed of PMP, but it still carries on some of the old family traits First and most obvious is the screen, which is a 4-incher with WVGA resolution (800 x 480) and decidedly sub-par performance It washes out easily and looks sinfully ugly sat next to a modern AMOLED display like that on the Google Pixel or Samsung Galaxy S8",tech
"What I'm not happy about is the Android-based UI on the Kann It's reasonably streamlined, but it's awfully laggy",tech
"Magnificent, musical soundHuge batteryExcellent build quality and durabilityFlexible expandability and connectivityHeavy and bulkyLaggy Android UIWashed-out screenHonda has been one of the more cautious automakers when it comes to self-driving cars, and a recent study put the company at 15th out of 18 in terms of overall advancement At a media event this week, however, Honda shared more about its plans and set a target of 2025 for introducing vehicles with Level 4 autonomous driving capabilityHonda has already said that it intends to have vehicles capable of Level 3 freeway driving on the market by 2020, and is reiterating that goal today",tech

"The first drive tested automated freeway driving technology of the type Honda plans to introduce in 2020 I got into a Legend (Acura RLX in the US), drove from a parking lot onto a ramp and pressed an auto button on the steering wheel; the car then merged with the closed-track freeway With my hands off the wheel and my feet off the pedal, the car accelerated to 100 kph (62 mph) to overtake a vehicle in the slow laneLater, in a simulated traffic jam, the car let me know that I was able to use the entertainment system mounted on the dashboard A Skype video call then came in, which I answered with a button on the steering wheel, and I was disconnected once the traffic cleared up and the car started to accelerate beyond a crawl",tech

"The fossils come from an archaeological site in Morocco, called Jebel Irhoud Hominin bones were first pulled out of the ground there in the 1960s, and were dated to about 40,000 years ago",tech
"The stone tools were a lucky find, because they gave the researchers  led by Jean-Jacques Hublin and Shannon McPherron at the Max Planck Institute in Germany  a chance to date that layer precisely By measuring how many electrons accumulated in the tools over millennia, the researchers dated the layer and the hominin bones within it to about 315,000 years agoFrom the skull fragments, the researchers virtually reconstructed the faces of the ancient humans who had once lived at the site",tech
"The two authors of an analysis published alongside the study agree with this assessment But, the findings havent been met with universal approval Paleoanthropologist John Hawks at the University of Wisconsin-Madison told Greshko that these new studies really arent adding anything new except the date Hawks added that he doesnt think the findings warrant creating a new category of early modern humans to describe the mix of primitive and modern traits But regardless of what we call these ancient relatives of ours, these new findings give us a better idea of how we became who we are today",tech

"To get a better sense of what research like this could be used for, I talked to Klink about the process, her favorite insights, and all the ways the label fan fiction can be usedThis interview has been edited for clarity and lengthWhats your background in fandom? Why did you decide to do this research?I started off as a fan, running a major Harry Potter fan-fic website, and through that met this guy Henry Jenkins whos one of the founders of fan studies",tech
"Before this, we ran another survey that was about peoples favorite tropes in fan fiction",tech
"Please be clear on this, this is not a scientific survey or anything Honestly, its just for fun I say this as a serious researcher: this is not actual research that I would rely on  for anything but it can help us to get a baseline idea If I really wanted to do this for real, it would have to be promoted in different ways and we would have to make sure that it was representative and well-designedThis research is just something you do in your free time, its not funded or anything?Absolutely not funded",tech
"What kinds of spaces were you promoting the survey in? 83 percent of the respondents were women, which didnt surprise me, but the age range was very diverse[For the podcast], we try to reach out to really diverse groups of people in terms of age, race, and what kind of a fan they are",tech

Stolen engine parts or whatever, they have serial numbers on them so that they can be traced If you rub the serial numbers off, you dont know where it came from, you cant trace it When people rub the serial numbers off their fan-fic, what that means is they take out all the things that make it fan-fic and just leave the story itself, the archetypes of the characters, and rename everything",tech

Einstein first predicted gravitational microlensing in his theory of general relativity,tech
"Microlensing is just one of many types of effects that occur when a huge object passes in front of a bright one Whole galaxies have been spotted warping the light from other galaxies before And sometimes, a foreground object can even break apart the light from a background object, creating four different images in whats known as an Einstein cross",tech
"Microlensing is a special type of this phenomenon In this case, a star passing behind another object is focused and amplified into something that looks much brighter than it actually is",tech
"Weve only ever seen this type of movement before with our own Sun, during an eclipse The Sun has enough gravity to bend the light of background stars, says Oswalt The catch, of course, is the Sun is so bright you cant see stars next to it in the sky, even though theyre there",tech
"After making enough projections, Sahu and his team identified around three candidates that may causing a microlensing event",tech
"Measuring the masses of stars this way could be much more precise than other techniques, since it involves observing the effect that one star has on another, Sahu says There could be more measurements like this headed our way soon Another one of the candidates Sahu identified was Proxima Centauri, the closest star to our Sun The team watched as the star passed in front of a background star, and the results of those observations could be released soonBut there are even more telescopes coming online that could be used to spot this phenomena",tech
"It's right there in the name And yet, the way Apple is trying to set the HomePod apart from direct competitors like Google's Home and Amazon's Echo, the HomePod ends up positioned oddly far from what seems like such an obvious goal",tech
"In case you missed its announcement Monday, the HomePod is Apple's first shot at a smart speaker It can be used alone or wirelessly synced up with other speakers, and it has built-in Siri for answering questions and taking commandsBut there are three things Google and Amazon do with their smart speakers that Apple doesn't: they make products that are discreet, they sell them at a more affordable price, and they put a heavy emphasis on what their digital assistants can doThe first two of those go hand in hand Google's Home and Amazon's Echo Dot (and to a lesser extent, the full-sized Echo) are small enough that they can be slipped into corners or placed unobtrusively on tables, counters, and nightstands",tech
"At $350, putting a HomePod in multiple rooms of your house isn't a very appealing prospect And while Apple has quite possibly made the most attractive speaker of the bunch, its speaker also takes up a bit more room The Echo is a utility, designed to be ignored But the HomePod is a speaker, meant to stand out as oneThere also aren't as many reasons to spread the HomePod throughout many rooms",tech
"That makes Apple's smart home play a bit more distant than it initially seemed The HomePod can deliver the same type of home-controlling functions as Google's Home and Amazon's Echo, but it isn't priced or sized to wind up in every room Like every element of Apple's smart home strategy so far, the function is there if you want it, but Apple doesn't really expect you to use it",tech
"That's a reasonable position given how niche the smart home market remains BI Intelligence recently found that only about 10 percent of homes are using smart home tech right now, with more and more expected to join in the coming years Apple has always shot for the higher end of the market, while Google and Amazon have always shot for mass adoption So the diverging strategies make senseEven so, Apple really does seem to be interested in the smart home market",tech
"Plus, as a very notable added bonus, every voice query going through Siri is one that isnt going through Google Assistant or Alexa Google clearly sees voice as a major component to the future of search, and thats why its been so aggressive about getting into this nascent spaceBy going only for the higher end of the market, Apple continues ceding some early smart home turf to its competitors, despite a wide-open opportunity Apple's HomeKit platform is the easiest option for someone who wants to start tinkering with smart home tech, and a smart speaker expands that ease of use  but only so far as it can actually get into the spaces people liveSpeakers come in all kinds of shapes and sizes, and so do most of Apple's products, so it seems reasonable to expect the HomePod line to grow and evolve over time",tech

"But that double-track has expanded into a massive highway, thanks to self-publishing tools like YouTube and other social media platforms And so the evolutionary trait of YouTube tabloids is granularity With hundreds of aspiring gossip-hounds combing the platform for drama  down to the happenings of tiny subcommunities  it might not make sense for a single publisher to invest time in a competition",tech

"Apple announced it was adding a new visual interface to its digital assistant, the ability to handle follow-up questions, and even language translation",tech
"What Apple failed to mention was whether its done anything to fix Siris biggest problem  understanding your spoken requestsVoice recognition has been the biggest drag on Siri since the assistants introduction in 2011 Too often, Siri whiffs when it tries to interpret your commands",tech
What Apple did instead was signal how it might try to get around those shortcomings: by changing what it considers Siri to be in the first place,tech
"In iOS 11, Siri does so much more in learning how youre using your device, Apples software SVP Craig Federighi said onstage, before explaining with a demo Federighi opened the Apple News app after reading about Iceland in Safari, and Siri surfaced stories about the country that he might like to read",tech
It didnt stop there,tech
"These sound like useful features, but they are far from what we considered Siri to be since Apple bought the company behind it in 2010, which is a digital assistant that we interact with directly",tech
"Apple has been slowly building to this for a while, starting with things like Siri app suggestions, a row of icons in the Spotlight screen that changes based on which app your phone thinks you want to use But now the company appears ready to apply that thinking broadly, using the Siri brand as a catchall for machine learning tricks that are starting to become standard on smartphones",tech
"If you buy Apples marketing, this is a major evolution of Siri Really though, it helps mitigate the risk associated with Siris biggest shortcoming, because it means youll have all new ways of obliquely interacting with the assistant that dont require voice recognition But even if it alleviates that pressure, the move opens up a new attack vector on Siri, because none of these new features that Apple showed off seem to surpass what competitors like Google, Amazon, or Microsoft are already doing with their own AI efforts",tech
"So where does that leave what we once thought of as Siri? In August of last year, Apple told the world that Siri was finally ready to strut its stuff Two months later, though, die-hard users were still finding the experience disappointing These next few months leading up to (and beyond) the next iPhone release feel like another one of those moments of truth",tech
Apple obviously feels confident enough in their digital assistant to put it front and center on every device; it even went so far as to build a whole piece of hardware around it with HomePod,tech

"In my testing Quickshots worked well, but they also highlighted the limitations of the Spark When you fly it using a mobile app paired to your phone over Wi-Fi, the Sparks range tops out at about 300 feet away and 150 feet up",tech
"Now these connectivity issues arent a knock on the Spark in particular Its something that happens with all Wi-Fi-connected drones, and was a regular occurrence when I was flying the Solo from 3D Robotics and the Bebop from Parrot And the Spark always made the best of a bad situation, automatically returning home and landing safely",tech
DJI is offering a $150 remote control that would extend the Sparks range to over a mile and up your top speed to 31 miles per hour,tech
"I would love to see a software update for the Spark that adds adaptive range When the video signal starts to fail, meaning the drone is on the edge of losing its Wi-Fi connection with your phone, the unit should automatically move back into range of a strong connection If it can continue executing a preprogrammed move while ensuring connection, even better",tech
"Ive been asked a dozen times over the last few years to recommend a drone for people who are interested in the hobby but arent sure if its for them At $499, the Spark is exactly what they are looking for Its cheap, for a camera drone, and easy to use You can get photos and video that are worth sharing on social media, albeit not quite professional quality And youll get a sense of what youre missing, leaving you the option to step up to a larger, more expensive unit if drone flying turns out to be something you enjoy",tech

"A few months ago, Apple offered a rare near-apology for the Mac Pro We designed ourselves into a bit of a corner, said Craig Federighi, which is probably the best way to say it Apple was so focused on whether it could put workstation components into a beautiful, tiny trash can form factor, that it never bothered to ask if it shouldBut by the time Apple was coming to this obvious conclusion, it was already too late for me to care whether or not Apple can figure out how to build a modern desktop computer I built my own Windows 10 PC late last year, and it's great",tech

"Meanwhile, the upcoming iMac Pro is the first computer from Apple that can easily outcompete my $1,100 DIY machine's GPU It starts at $4,999",tech
"I'm not asking for an iPhone with replaceable RAM I understand the value of a sleek, highly integrated, highly custom product But if the most important and expensive part of the desktop computer you're looking to buy is the GPU, it's insane to choose one that's soldered to the motherboard",tech
"So-called ""enthusiast"" users  gamers, game creators, VR dwellers, programmers  know exactly how much computer they can get for their money, and which components are the most valuable to them I might've splurged on a GPU at the expense of all else, but someone else might want to emphasize the CPU and storage speed",tech
"Sadly, Apple refuses to provide choice to the exact customers who value it the most Apple promises the next Mac Pro will be modular and upgradeable, which will be a great improvement, but if it still starts at $2,999, it's basically meaningless to people like me",tech

"Apple finally announced an augmented reality platform for developers yesterday, and its about time ARKit, as the tool is called, lets app makers draw on detailed camera and sensor data to map digital objects into 3D space This lets them move beyond simple 2D camera overlays, without requiring the heavy-duty software engineering behind more advanced tools like Snapchat world lensesIf nothing else, Apple has just made catching pokmon more immersive But ARKit could also let the company compete against Google, which currently sets the gold standard for phone-based augmented reality",tech
"ARKit enables what Apple refers to as world tracking, which works through a technique called visual-inertial odometry Using the iPhone or iPads camera and motion sensors, ARKit finds a bunch of points in the environment, then tracks them as you move the phone",tech
"On the other hand, ARKit doesnt work exactly like Tango",tech
"ARKit could improve individual elements of existing AR apps; Apple promises excellent object scaling, for example Apple says ARKit also uses a fraction of the phones CPU, so it could make AR less of a resource drain",tech
"But ARKit is also a stepping stone in a smaller sense As a general iOS 11 feature, its straddling the gap between Apples single-camera devices and its dual-camera iPhone 7 Plus These cameras offer better depth sensing, and if they become a standard iOS feature, ARKit could start feeling a lot closer to Tango",tech
"If a phone can track someone walking around a virtual object, you could theoretically pop that phone in a VR headset and let them walk around a virtual environment Thats why Google used Tango technology for its all-in-one VR headset Lots of people have speculated that Apple is planning an iPhone-based headset, particularly since it may be switching to VR-friendly OLED screens And now that Apple is officially in the augmented reality game, its less of a leap to full VRThat said, theres a much higher bar for virtual reality tracking: you wont literally get sick if an AR object slips out of place, which is a real concern in VR",tech
"For all the excitement over augmented reality, its worth remembering that no one has launched a major app with AR as the main selling point Pokmon Go, touted as one of ARs big successes, featured the technology as a minor aesthetic perk; we even recommended people turn it off to play the game better Snapchat augmented reality took off because people were already using Snapchat, and if AR filters succeed on Facebook, itll likely be for the same reasonMaking augmented reality more accessible could change this, freeing developers to build AR-first apps for a huge audience with low overhead Even if these dont break through, augmented realitys killer app could also be the slow creep of AR into apps people are already using  think ubiquitous filters in video services, or an optional AR mode in games",tech

"Additionally, if you send multiple images or videos consecutively in a chat, theyll now be automatically grouped into a single album (as seen below) instead of a stream of multiple in-line images Lastly, you can now swipe right on an individual message in a thread to directly respond to it, which could be useful for group chatsThe new features are available on iOS now; no Android launch date has been given, but its probable that theyll show up in the near future",tech
"Just a few weeks after Amazon opened its drive-up grocery pickup service in Seattle, it looks like Walmart is trialling its own version of the concept with a new automated kiosk at a store in Oklahoma City The service, which doesnt seem to have any special name as of yet, lets Walmart customers order their groceries online or through an app and select to pick up the order from a 24-hour kiosk",tech
"Just like AmazonFreshs concept in Seattle, Walmarts system sends a customers order to a local store, where employees will package their items into ready-to-pickup bags When a customer pulls up to the kiosk, he or she enters a five-digit pickup code and the machine will retrieve the grocery bags for them, similar to a vending machine The self-pickup service is free, but there is a purchase minimum of $30The automated kiosk  which at 20 x 80 feet, looks more like a standalone building  is being tested for consumer feedback before expanding more widely Walmart says its been working on online grocery pickup since 2014 thats similar to what AmazonFresh offers now in Seattle, and has expanded the service to more than 600 stores so it is hoping to quickly expand its automated system if all goes well",tech
"Besides, AmazonFresh currently services customers in major cities, including Los Angeles, Seattle, San Francisco, New York, Boston, Chicago, and Philadelphia, while Walmart has at least one location in every state Given the market size, Amazon might need to do more than offer pickup without an order minimum or offer to bring your order to your car if it wants to fully competeJust days before The Mummy hits theaters, Universal is expanding its recently named Dark Universe with two more films",tech

The next rover that NASA plans to send to Mars in 2020 has a big job to do: gather and prepare samples from the Red Planet that can eventually be returned to Earth Its the first step toward a coveted Mars sample return  one of the highest priorities in the planetary science community right now The only problem? There is no second step planned,tech
"Dreier argues that, above all, the most immediate need is the development of a new Mars telecommunications orbiter Any future spacecraft we send to the Red Planet is going to need a way to communicate with mission teams on Earth",tech
"NASA has been studying a number of new orbiter concepts, but the Planetary Society says its time to commit to a design as soon as possible The ideal timeframe for an orbiter to start is yesterday, says Dreier In order to have an orbiter ready to launch by 2022 or 2024, funding needs to be included in the budget for fiscal year 2018",tech
"Beyond a new orbiter, the Planetary Society says NASA should at least start to figure out how to create a vehicle that can get samples off the Red Planet And thats going to be a monumental task A Mars sample return is going to require a vehicle that can land on Mars and then take back off again, and somehow, the samples will need to be transported to that vehicle while its on the surface",tech

"Around the release of What Remains of Edith Finch, video game academic, essayist, and lovable provocateur Ian Bogost inspired a kerfuffle with the controversially titled The Atlantic essay Video Games Are Better Without Stories",tech
"If there is a future of games, let alone a future in which they discover their potential as a defining medium of an era, Bogost concluded, it will be one in which games abandon the dream of becoming narrative media and pursue the one they are already so good at: taking the tidy, ordinary world apart and putting it back together again in surprising, ghastly new waysFinch is an argument that games can be both Shaped like a musky short story collection, the game sends the player deep into the Seussian house of the Finch clan, and its family tree, of which each branch has a tragic end By spelunking the rooms of lost relatives, the player is launched, through time, to relive a series of final moments The vignettes borrow style from the kings of horror shorts  Edgar Allen Poe, Ray Bradbury, Stephen King  along with other short fiction masters, like Tobias Wolff and Lorrie Moore",tech

"In one of the games final stories, you must navigate a dreamworld of puzzles with one side of the controller, while chopping fish heads in a factory with the other Rapidly, the dream takes over the screen, but the real-world obligation never goes away, nor does it become any less dangerous The sequence is not subtle: its an ode to and warning of the sheer power of games to transport us into new, impossible spacesAvailable on PS4 and PCIve whined for years about action games that star the same bald dude fighting the same one-dimensional villains, using the same rocket launcher and machine guns",tech

"A Lyft spokesperson later added, We are not disclosing the details of the work we are doing with each partner",tech
"Uber has placed tablets in the backseats of its self-driving cars so passengers can see how the vehicles sensors perceive the surrounding environment  as well as snap a selfie Its unclear whether Lyfts in-car app experience will attempt something similar, but NuTonomy CEO Karl Iagnemma said their plan is to focus on optimizing the passenger experience by sharing knowledge about how the vehicle is driving itself",tech
"We dont really know in detail how riders are going to engage with autonomous vehicles because we just havent frankly had that much real-world experience, Iagnemma added",tech
It wasnt too long ago that Lyfts co-founders were dismissing Ubers public trials as a marketing stunt But a lot has changed in the past year,tech
"Both Uber and Waymo are offering rides to the public in Arizona Uber is also operating a small fleet of self-driving cars in Pittsburgh (though the companys relationship with the city government appears to be souring) And almost three dozen companies have signed up to test their autonomous cars in California, although none have gone so far as to invite average people rides",tech
"But no amount of natural language processing or extra functionality can fix my core problem with Siri, and voice assistants in general: I just dont want to talk to themSome of my colleagues love them, but for me, voice assistants just feel intrusive, unwelcome, and downright awkward",tech
"In this world, I dont want Siri to be able to put together a picture of me (or more likely, clarify the picture Apple already has) through search topics, activation times, and even my accent",tech
"But Ive realized that my fear of voice assistants really comes from a more subconscious place Im British, so talking to strangers is awkward already",tech
"I sometimes find human American friends unable to understand me  I see them with their heads cocked to the side, knowing that were meant to share a common tongue Robots have even less of a chance, especially when they cant take facial or contextual clues They also cant do what I think my friends often do: simply nod, smile, and ask someone else later what the hell I was chatting about",tech
"Still, I can usually make the machine catch my drift on the second or third attempt, but for those with other accents, its sometimes tougher I bought a PlayStation Camera along with my PS4, (foolishly) expecting it to be an integral part of the next-generation console gaming experience When I first used it, I called my wife over to watch as I started a game using nothing but the power of my voice",tech
"For the record, my wife is from the northeast of England, and she has an accent described in the country as Geordie",tech
"Ive seen excitingly accented friends have similar trouble with Siri  their scouse, manc, or brummie brogue lost on the posho that lives inside my phone",tech
"And really, is that so bad?

"Probably the biggest critique of OnePlus, the small Chinese company that has garnered global hype and acclaim with its Android phones, is that its customer service is not good enough OnePlus phones are often great, but the experience of owning one and dealing with a fault or needing a repair has not been so hot for everyone",tech
"Honestly, customer care is the unglamorous stuff that doesnt spark much hype or attention before the launch of a new device, but it certainly matters over the full course of owning one Its good to see OnePlus addressing what has historically been a weakness",tech

"HP is outfitting the Omen X Compact with Kaby Lake i7 processor options and a GeForce GTX 1080 Its also pretending like you might buy this PC for reasons other than VR  in case you really want a PC that mounts on a detachable pedestal / dock, I guess  and so the computer itself is being sold separately from the backpack parts needed to take it portable",tech

"Speaking to Bloomberg, Cook said: Weve been cooperating with the UK government not only in law enforcement matters, but on some of the attacks  and I cant speak in detail about thatCooks comments implied that the status quo of digital surveillance was sufficient for investigations",tech
"Three terrorist attacks in the last three months have resurfaced the issue of online surveillance and regulation in the UK The current Conservative government has consistently demanded new powers in this domain, and last year introduced legislation that would  hypothetically  allow it to force companies to break encryption protocols However, the political costs of doing so might be steep, and at this point both government and industry simply seem to be talking up their respective positions After this weeks UK general election is over, though, the conversation is bound to move forwardAlthough we were rebuffed at Apples main demo area at WWDC today, we did get a chance to go listen to the HomePod later on",tech
"Im no audio expert, so my colleagues Vlad and Nilay will surely take me to task for the words Im about to type, but here goes The main thing to know is that Apple has done a remarkably good job finding ways to get its speaker to feel like its filling a room with sound It starts with the subwoofer, which delivers bass that doesnt quite hit you in the chest but does manage to put other smart speakers like the Echo or Google Home to shame",tech
"Thats not really a surprise  this is called the HomePod, after all, and it seems like it was designed for music rather than as a vehicle for some vision of ambient computing",tech
"Oh, one last interesting note: the units we listened to had big + and - buttons on the top, not the Siri waveform The Siri glow is what you should expect to get, but it seems like you will be able to tap the top of the speaker to adjust volume directly instead of controlling everything with Siri or sliders on your iPhoneAt WWDC 2017, Apple is set to announce Business Chat, a feature that looks to be a direct shot at customer service messaging platforms like Facebook Messenger and Twitters DM support",tech
"Apple today announced that, as part of its updated Metal 2 graphics tech in macOS High Sierra, that Macs would soon support external GPUs via the Thunderbolt 3 port This paves the way for virtual reality development on lighter-weight laptops and also opens up the possibility that Mac users will some day be able to plug in and play with VR headsets",tech
"That said, the Apple-approved enclosure on the companys website is a Sonnet external GPU chassis with Thunderbolt 3 support and a 350-watt power supply",tech

"Apples latest desktop powerhouse is a pro variant of its all-in-one iMac, which will start shipping in December starting at $4,999 The device has all sorts of top-notch specs, including a Xeon processor that scales up to 18 cores and an all-new AMD Radeon Vega GPU",tech
"But the computers most aesthetically pleasing perk happens to be an all-new space gray finish alongside space gray accessories, which weve never seen from Apple before Unfortunately, the company says these new color options for the wireless Magic Mouse, Magic Trackpad, and Magic Keyboard will be restricted to buyers of the iMac Pro, according to 9to5MacThats a huge bummer, considering how sleek and much-needed a black option is Of course, Apple has been known to take hardline stances on certain design aspects, choosing to restrict certain color choices to distinct price tiers But this is a whole other level of unnecessary, especially when you factor in just how many customers would shell out for mice and keyboards in a color beyond bland Apple white",tech
"Apple also confirmed to 9to5Mac that the iMac Pro will not have user-replaceable RAM, which is perhaps equally disappointing but much less surprising The company currently allows users to replace the RAM on its 27-inch 5K iMac model, but not on the 215-inch one So its pretty in line with Apples stance on part swapping to have gone the more restrictive route with the iMac Pro The good news: you can configure the device to have up to 128GB of ECC RAM (if youre willing to spend a fortune), which is specifically designed to protect against data loss and corruption",tech

"The biggest updates in iOS 11 are on the iPad And for once, iOS is taking hints from macOS, instead of the other way aroundiOSs new dock, in particular, feels like its come straight from the Mac",tech
"The dock hides much like it does for fullscreen Mac apps, too But instead of moving your mouse cursor down, you just swipe up to reveal the dock again",tech
"On one hand, all of these changes complicate the iPad and could make the device harder for some people to use The operating system no longer feels like its as on rails as it used to be",tech

"Earlier today, Apple announced a new version of the iPad Pro, a 105-inch model that is technically just a little bit larger than the earlier 97-inch tablet but, with 40 percent smaller bezels, it offers much more screen real estate",tech
"For most people, the first question to ask is probably: okay, well how big is it? We didnt have a 9",tech
"Whats more interesting are the new iOS 11 multitasking features for the iPad that are borrowed from macOS With these changes it feels as though Apple has stopped trying to convince its iPad users (or potential iPad customers) that they should just figure out how to be productive despite mobile limitations, and has acknowledged that some people might actually like to be able to manipulate apps and files on mobile In some ways its even reminiscent of what Microsoft was trying to do with Windows 8 on the Surface tablet, as my colleague Tom Warren astutely pointed out",tech
The first thing youll notice about the new iOS 11 on the iPad is that theres an app dock at the bottom of the display,tech
"After using the iPad Pro for just a few minutes, Ive pretty much determined that a dock is one of the simplest and best things Apple could have done for the iPad, which Ive had a hard time accepting as a true productivity device, but theres moreYou can now switch between iPad apps by activating a Mission Control-like interface using a four-finger swipe",tech

"But while those hacks focused on influence operations, The Intercept report reveals a hacking group linked to Russia was also directly targeting US voting infrastructure In one campaign, the group sent attempted phishing emails to seven different employees at an unnamed voting system company Three of the emails went to non-existent email addresses, but at least one is believed to have successfully compromised its target",tech

"Thats why one of the best parts of the show is the moment when Apple just says screw it and dumps a few dozen new features into one slide There isnt a ton of detail beyond the screen that Apple SVP Craig Federighi flashed onstage, but its enough to give us an idea of what well be looking forward to in iOS 11",tech
"Digital assistants are just as frustrating as they are helpful, so making it easier to interact with them is always welcome It looks like Apple is finally going to add one of the most requested features for any digital assistant  youll be able to type to Siri in iOS 11 Socially awkward tech nerds, rejoice!QR codes arent nearly as big in America as they are in other parts of the world, and so Apple has been able to skate by without natively supporting QR codes for a while now But it looks like the companys finally changing that by adding QR code support to, likely, the native camera app in iOS 11 Finally  no more bothering with third-party apps once a year when you need to scan a QR code",tech
"Apple started allowing developers to offer third-party keyboards with iOS 8 Since then, its been picking some of the most-loved features available in that marketplace (like stickers and apps) and slowly adding them to iMessage The newest one coming to iOS 11 is one-handed mode",tech
"Following in the footsteps of competitors like Samsung, which started allowing screen recording (and GIF creation) on its last few Galaxy phones, Apple appears ready to add that functionality in iOS 11 Heres hoping Apple will let you capture and create GIFs, tooThis feature got a bit more of a tease during the iPad Pro demo, but it looks like Apple is making it much easier to mark up the things you screenshot on your iOS 11 devices",tech

"Apple isnt the only tech company looking to make AI work better on mobile, though, and this announcement fits an industry-wide trend Both Google and Facebook have previously announced versions of their machine learning frameworks optimized for mobile devices, and chip-maker Qualcomm has created its own software (named the Neural Processing Engine) to smooth the mobile AI experience Machine learning: its not just happening in the cloud anymoreApple has announced a tool it calls ARKit, which will provide advanced augmented reality capabilities on iOS Its supposed to allow for fast and stable motion tracking that makes objects look like theyre actually being placed in real space, instead of simply hovering over it",tech

"But during that time the studio started to change Last year Ken Wong, lead designer on the original Monument Valley, left to form his own studio Mountains",tech
"But a few chapters in, Monument Valley starts to expand in new and interesting ways Youll encounter portals that shift you from one area of a stage to another, and trees that will only grow when subjected to sunlight Toward the end youll control both characters, which gives a completely different feel to the puzzles",tech
"Perhaps the biggest change in Monument Valley 2, though, is its much larger focus on storytelling Like the original, the sequel isnt a game with much in the way of an explicit narrative; theres little text and no lengthy cutscenes Instead, it tells its story through a combination of character animations and the environment; you infer whats going on by watching the mother and daughter and how they interact with the world around them",tech
"The parental narrative also came about in part because several members of the development team became parents themselves during the gap between the two games David Fernndez Huerta, Monument Valley 2s art director, had his first child in that time, and he parlayed that personal experience into the game",tech
"Ive always been against working on sequels, says Huerta But theres something about Monument Valley that is fertile ground  you can do anything with it",tech

"In iOS 11, Apple has completely redesigned Control Center, which is the panel that users can swipe up to access frequent and important settings or change songs when listening to musicThe iPad is getting some special attention with iOS 11 Apple is making the iPads dock similar to the Macs by letting users add many more apps to itA new drag-and-drop feature lets you quickly move info or media from one split-screen app into the one beside it Yes, thats pretty basic stuff  but it shows exactly why Apple needed to make these iPad improvements in the first place",tech

"When Prey launched on May 8th, for instance, it purportedly supported PS4 Pro",tech
"According to Jim Ryan, president and CEO and Sony Interactive Entertainment Europe, the responsibility to support the hardware lies with game developers That is to say, each developer must spend time and resources to tweak and patch their games to take advantage of the PS4s added power",tech
"Its one of those things where we very much leave it to the content creator to make what they will of the power of the machine, he says I think the proof of the pudding is in the tasting; when you look at something like Horizon Zero Dawn, which is just gorgeous on PS4 Pro, you can see firsthand what the device delivers",tech
"The entire concept of mid-cycle upgrades like PS4 Pro and Project Scorpio  consoles that are more powerful than their predecessors, but not an entirely new generation of hardware  is still largely unproven territory, and recent studies suggest that a majority of consumers are unaware of the new devices and the advantages they offerHistorically, raw power has had little impact on the success of a console; just look at the meteoric sales of the original Wii compared to the more powerful PS3 and Xbox 360",tech

"Heres an overview of what they revealed, and well see tomorrow how accurate it is",tech
"One of the more interesting sets of details was about Apples rumored augmented reality Glasses Reports of the devices surfaced last fall, and Apple CEO Tim Cook recently noted that the company has invested in AR",tech
"According to Foxconninsider, the project is called Project Mirrorshades (a reference to a 1980s Cyberpunk anthology?), which would be designed to bring AR to a larger audienceThe glasses consist of a Kopin NED Acetate frame, Polarisized or prescription lens with Zeiss smart optics, Bone induction modules Microphones (noise cancellation), Light sensor Accelerometer for step tracking and head movement, app navigation Magnetometer for navigation, Capacitive Pavel Ceramic battery, Apple chipset, [and] Charging circuit BL5 Induction module",tech
"Movement would play some role in the function of the glasses: Foxconninsider noted that for an app like Tinder, a user could shake their head for no, or nod for yes A small capacitive strip on the arm would allow users to accept calls and control the volume, while Siri could also be used to make calls The device would use a prism that conveys NED display image to lens, and would have 428 x 240 resolution",tech
"The insiders noted that they only saw a transparent reader lens but I understand they can procure polarised or prescription lenses, that the frames were Cellulose acetate Injection mold frames into an aluminum mold, that they came in two sizes (mens and womens), and that they had a P3 frame design There was also the possibility that there would be seasonal design updates",tech
"Foxconninsider referred to the overhauled iPhone as the iPhone X, and that production has been delayed, which is in line with some rumors that have surfaced recently",tech
"They also reported that they saw some test units with fingerprint scanners mounted below the glass, but performance and yield rates were not good They explained that they havent seen a rumored rear fingerprint scanner, speculating that it might have been misinformation",tech
"The user spoke a bit about an previously rumored iPhone 7 refresh: noting that itll have an aluminum unibody instead of a glass chassis, and that it wont have wireless charging",tech
"Apple is thought to be revealing its Siri-powered home device tomorrow, and Foxconninsider had some details about the device They described the device as having a similar shape to that of the Mac Pro, but smaller, but also cautioned that they hadnt seen it in a while They did note that they tested three designs: one design without camera, without screen (The third presumably has both) The device would also come with a modified A9 chip",tech
"They predicted that it would be announced soon, but that it wouldnt come out until later this yearApple is reportedly updating its entire MacBook lineup this year, with a new MacBook Pro, a more powerful version of the 12-inch MacBook, and an updated 13-inch MacBook Air (Foxconninsider noted in the thread that the MacBook Air was being discontinued, so well see) They noted that they tested some updated MacBook designs, which included more glass and dark black body, as well as a reintroduction of white apple light that was discontinued in 2015 When asked if it would be similar to the Thunderbolt Display, they agreed: Somewhat; similar to the black iPhone 7 and the iPhone X finish (like iPhone 4)",tech
They also said that the discontinued MagSafe would return in 12-18 months,tech
"When asked about the keyboards, they noted that they tested two e-paper technologies; E-ink in black and white and color, other a color Qualcomm display (cancelled due to IP dispute) They also noted that the keys would be low profileThey also noted that they dont have access to the iPads, but did confirm a rumored third iPad size",tech
"Foxconninsider noted that contrary to rumors, Apple is sticking with its lightning cable When asked about TV panels, they also said that therell be some information coming later this year about the Apple TVThey also spoke a little about some of the projects that have been canceled over the years, listing several: IoT devices like fitness band, headphone designs, larger keyboard with backlighting etcThe thread details a number of specific updates and details about Apples next line of products, some of which fit with the rumors that have come in recent months However, its worth noting that its not clear how accurate all of these leaks will be, given that the users themselves noted that they havent seen some of the devices in a while",tech

"Inside the Wonder Woman women-only screenings pictwittercom/t2HmlavFczIts a sharp break from the reactions to previous controversies When The Force Awakens star Rey (Daisy Ridley) was derided online by misogynists as a Mary Sue  a thinly written wish-fulfillment character who is overly talented and beyond reproach in every way  the well-intentioned lined up to explain all the ways in which she wasnt They were rebutting an argument that drew most of its lifeblood from a corner of the internet that frankly didnt give a shit either way, and was going to hate the movie regardless",tech

"Related""Don't see an Alien sequel"" is some of the most reliable moviegoing advice you can get, but Covenant looked gorgeous  and its reviews have been pretty good, too  so I went to check it out last weekendIts really interesting how many elements Ridley Scott carries over from the original Alien Covenant has an almost identical structure, one designed to warm you up to the characters, stress you the heck out, and then watch you squirm until it's all over",tech
"Even though the film's structure is similar to the original, the pacing of the scary moments changes in such a huge way because Scott is able to dramatically ramp up the speed Thinking back to the original Alien, I can barely remember seeing the thing move  now, with CGI, Covenant can show these creatures doing all kinds of a wild, dexterous things",tech
"District 9 director Neill Blomkamp is back with some creepy new aliens and a very interesting new project Blomkamp has set up Oats Studios to produce a series of ""experimental"" short films that'll get released through Steam The shorts don't seem to be ""experimental"" in an art film way; its more that theyre a way of testing audience reaction  if people like the shorts, they might then get worked into feature films",tech

"The Society is a manifestation of political theory and philosophy While its inhabitants enjoy a better standard of living than their lunar counterparts, resentment bubbles under the surface Not everyone agrees with the aims of the Society, and agents, internal and external, are pushing for changes to how things run",tech

"Photography by Andrew Liptak / The VergeIts been an eventful two years since Neill Blomkamps last film, Chappie, hit theaters He spent part of that time working to develop a fifth installment of the Alien franchise, only to have it overtaken by Ridley Scotts Alien: Covenant At the same time, he directed an installment of BMWs The Hire series, starring Clive Owen, and signed on to help write and direct an adaptation of Thomas Sweterlitschs upcoming novel The Gone WorldBut whats more exciting is Blomkamps next project, something that hes been teasing on Twitter and Instagram for months now Oats Studios is his attempt to create a new outlet for some of his ideas, putting together a series of short films that will be released online for free, in an attempt to see if one or more will gain some traction online",tech
"The Verge recently spoke with Blomkamp by phone about how Oats Studios came to be, his take on the state of the film industry, and what really happened to his Alien sequelThe below interview has been edited and condensed for clarityI really like what youve been posting to Twitter and YouTube, and Im interested in seeing what you have coming up with Oats Studios, and where you're going with itIve been building it for about two years I have met pretty talented people that we've slowly assembled, so its been happening for a long time",tech

"That's entirely CGIOh, wow!There are a shitload of practical effects",tech
"Does that extend to writing? If you, or employees, are looking to break down an idea into a screenplay?Thats another thing that I want to do In the beginning, I wrote everything Theres a writer named Thomas Sweterlitsch, who wrote this amazing science fiction story that I am adapting for Fox called The Gone World",tech
"Thats where the thing with Oats is interesting It's this place where you can go from making massive films like The Gone World, which are traditional in the sense that they are released to theaters But I wanted the other 50 percent of my life to be a creative sandbox, and see how those two things interact with one another",tech
"What about your previous films? Are you interested in using this as a workshop for tie-ins to District 9, Elysium, or Chappie?Probably not, no In order to do that you would have to interact with the studios that own those films The whole point here is to just be autonomous and just do whatever we want",tech
"With District 9, I plan on making another film in that world To go back and work with WETA, and make the film would be cool, but anything that preexists like that may not be the best fit for whatever we're trying hereYou've been asked about this a lot, but Im guessing that your Alien concept is completely done, right?I think it's totally dead, yes",tech

"But Disney isnt alone in this strategy Parks have become an increasingly important investment focus for Hollywood studios  particularly as blockbuster season has become dominated by franchises and expanded universe films With US movie attendance stagnating, the future is more uncertain than ever, and bringing beloved intellectual properties like Marvel into the physical realm adds a new revenue stream to the portfolio",tech
"Theme parks riffing on existing intellectual property is certainly nothing new Disneys been doing it for decades, and over the years visitors to Universals parks have been able to go on rides based on everything from Jurassic Park to Twister But the landscape shifted in 2010, when the Universal Orlando Resort opened The Wizarding World of Harry Potter Instead of going for standalone rides, Wizarding World was about recreating the experience of being in JK",tech
"As Wizarding World expanded its Orlando footprint and spread to California and Japan, the opportunity was obvious: the chance to visit the fictional world of the franchise didnt just bring visitors into the park",tech
Bolstering that strategy is the way Pandora plays into the franchises larger lore,tech
"Anecdotally, Pandora seems to have the desired effect; after touring the world my colleague James Bareham and I both commented that the first thing we wanted to do was watch the original movie again But the trick for Disney is that it doesnt actually own Avatar",tech

"The Chrome ad blocker doesnt just help publishers, it also helps Google maintain its dominance And it advantages Googles own ad units, which, its safe to say, will not be in violation of the bad ad rules",tech

"We still dont know whether life once existed on Mars when the planet was warmer and had liquid water But todays findings, published in Science, give a much more nuanced and detailed picture of what this area of Mars could have looked like through time The papers results will have to be tested by analyzing more rocks in the crater",tech
"The data and interpretations presented here provide necessary clues to answer the big open question: What happened to the water on Mars? Isaac Smith, a postdoctoral researcher at the Planetary Science Institute, who was not involved in the research, writes in an email to The Verge Smith called the findings ""impressive""Since landing inside the 93-mile-wide Gale Crater in 2012, NASAs Curiosity rover has been drilling and analyzing rock samples The rover has discovered the chemical ingredients  like carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, and sulfur  needed for life as we know it on Earth The lake had all the right stuff for microbial life to live in, says study co-author Joel Hurowitz, a geochemist and planetary scientist at Stony Brook University",tech
"Curiosity is currently climbing up a three-mile-high layered mountain inside the crater This mountain, called Mount Sharp, is believed to be the result of mud and sediments carried through time by rivers into the lake, where it eventually petrified into mudstone",tech
"The authors of todays study analyzed the chemical and mineral composition of the mudstones that were drilled by Curiosity, to see what they could reveal about the lake and the ancient Martian climate Certain minerals in certain rocks were shown to have interacted with oxygen, while others much less so This is because some sediments were in shallow waters, where there was more oxygen, while others were in deep waters, where there was very little oxygen, according to the authors",tech
"This is a new level of detail in terms of our understanding of the chemical environment in this lake on Mars, says Hurowitz It gives us a much more complete picture of the habitability of this lakeThe findings basically show that the lake in Gale Crater had different areas  some rich in oxygen, some not  that could have supported different types of microbes",tech
"By analyzing the mudstones, the researchers were also able to figure out the types of climate in which the rocks formed before being transported to the lake",tech
"The study has some limitations Its only about roughly 330 feet of sediment layers in one corner of Gale Crater, says Bennett",tech
So more research will need to happen to prove that the lake had different chemical environments and that Mars climate fluctuated as widely as todays findings suggest,tech
"Still, if confirmed, todays findings could change how we interpret the planets climate and just how habitable ancient Mars was In fact, one suggestion from the paper  that Mars had warmer and wetter climates that permitted liquid water in lakes as recently as about 3 billion years ago  is pretty significant, since thats later than some scientists thought It pushes the existence of liquid water closer to the present,  Ehlmann says And the closer we get to understanding what ancient Mars was like, the closer we come to answering the big question: whether the Red Planet actually hosted lifeFacebook is overhauling how its photo albums work to let users drop in virtually any post from the social network to save for posterity",tech

"Similar to the first two detections, the latest gravitational waves LIGO measured stemmed from two dense black holes chaotically merging billions of light-years away Black holes dont just simply come together when they merge; they rapidly spin around each other  up to several times per second  before joining to form one single super-dense object",tech
"The earliest stars were made up of only the lightest elements, hydrogen and helium  the first elements to form But as the stars evolved, they eventually created heavier elements inside their cores through nuclear fusion reactions",tech

"The LIGO collaboration is using this latest detection to figure out more details about the two black holes that created the latest waves For instance, the signals hold clues as to how the holes were spinning up until the point they merged And that, in turn, paints a picture of how the merger occurred in the first placeWhen black holes merge, there are three types of rotations involved: the two holes each rotate individually and they revolve around each other If both the black holes rotate in the same general direction as how theyre revolving around each other, then theyre considered aligned, according to Laura Cadonati, a LIGO collaborator and professor of physics at Georgia Institute of Technology",tech

"Fidget Spinner looks and functions like many other fidget spinner games in the App Store, but its hard to tell whos mimicking who It seems all parties are equally looking to cash in on a hot, albeit undoubtedly short-lived, trend In an email to The Verge, Morcos says the idea was inspired by the popularity of real-life spinners",tech
"Trend-chasing developers approach the market like gamblers: the more you play, the better your odds A handful of creators have multiple fidget spinner games listed on their developer page, or attached to different accounts Binh Nguyens iPhone apps, for example, include four fidget spinner-themed games: Tappy Fidget Spinner 3D & Challenge Games, Fidget Spinner!, Spinner Color Finger - Fidget Ping Pong Games, and Swing Fidget Spinner - Arcade GamesAll four games are listed under Binh Nguyen, but clicking the websites associated with each will take you on a wild goose chase Tappy Fidget Spinner directs to an unfinished website, labeled Games iOS 2017, with images of men and women on a beach",tech
"Neptun Digital is another developer taking more than one bite from the same apple It lists two games, Fidget Spinner - Finger Hand Spin Simulator and Fidget Spinner - Hand Spin Simulator; if youre having trouble telling them apart, the former uses a red-and-gray color palette while the latter is primarily blue and gray",tech
Tastypill claims to have produced the first spinner game  Spinny Fidget   in the App Stores top charts (Its also the creator of Fidget Spin,tech

"Microsoft is once again redesigning Skype todayDescribed as the next generation of Skype, the new design focuses on messaging Skype is well known and used widely for video and audio calls, but iMessage, WhatsApp, Messenger, Snapchat and other messaging services have taken the lead for todays conversations The new Skype messaging interface now includes three sections in a conversation: find, chat, and capture Find lets you search through a conversation, or find images, restaurants, and even add-ins like YouTube or Giphy to add content into a message",tech
"Capture feels a lot like Snapchat within Skype, and it immediately launches into the camera to let you take pictures or hold down for video As you hold down for video youll immediately recognize one of the more subtle design changes in this new version of Skype, a squiggly line that represents the amount of time for a recording This line is also used for calling, or when contacts are typing",tech
Skype is also introducing a new Highlights feature thats a lot like Snapchat stories Highlights lets you post a stream of photos and videos that friends can view and react with emoticons,tech
"Even calling is getting redesigned for this new version of Skype You can drag and drop people around in conversations, and react with emoticons during calls",tech
"Workers can even operate the arm remotely using an off-the-shelf HTC Vive headset and virtual reality motion controllers It turns out that VR is great for gathering data on depth and other information humans intuitively use to grasp objectsKindred is now focused on getting its finished Orb into warehouses, where it can begin learning at an accelerated pace by sorting vastly different products and observing human operators Because the company gathers data every time a human uses the Orb, engineers are able to improve its software over time using techniques such as reinforcement learning, which improves software through repetition Down the line, the Orb should slowly take over more responsibility and, ideally, learn to perform new tasks",tech
"But Kindreds ultimate goal is much more ambitious It may sound counterintuitive, but Rose and Gildert think warehouses are the perfect place to start on the path toward human-level artificial intelligence Because the US shipping marketplace is already rife with single-purpose robots, thanks in part to Amazon, there are plenty of opportunities for humans to train AI",tech
"Rose and Gildert believe the next generation of AI wont be in the form of a disembodied voice living in our phones Rather, they believe the greatest strides will come from programs running inside a physical robot can gain knowledge about the world and itself from the ground up, like a human infant does from birth",tech
"Kindreds is working toward whats known as artificial general intelligence, or software capable of performing any task a human being can do",tech
"This is the fundamental challenge of AGI: how to create an intelligent system, the kind we know only from science fiction, that can truly learn on its own without needing to be fed thousands of examples and trained over the course of weeks or monthsThe biggest names in AI research, like DeepMind, are focused on game-playing because it seems to be the most viable path forward",tech
"Yet for Kindreds founders, the quest to crack the secret of human cognition cant be separated from our physical bodies Our founding belief was that in order to make real progress toward the original objectives of AI, you needed to start by grounding your ideas in the physical world, Rose says And that means robots, and robots with sensors that can look around, touch, hear the world that surrounds them",tech
"This body-first approach to AI is based on a theory called embodied cognition, which suggests that the interplay between our brain, body, and the physical world is what produces elements of consciousness and the ability to reason (A fun exercise here is thinking about how many common metaphors have physical underpinnings, like thinking of affection as warmth or something inconceivable as being over your head",tech
"By giving its robot sensory abilities and motor functions and then using AI training techniques, the BRETT team devised a way for it to acquire knowledge and physical skills much faster than with standard programming  and with the flexibility to keep learning Much like how babies are constantly adjusting their behavior when attempting something new, BRETT also approaches unique problems, fails at first, and then adjusts over repeated attempts and under new constraints Abbeels team even uses childrens toys to test BRETTs aptitude for problem solving",tech
"OpenAI, the nonprofit funded by SpaceX and Tesla CEO Elon Musk, is working on both general purpose game-playing algorithms and robotics, under the notion that both avenues are complementary",tech
"Applying AI to real-world tasks like picking up objects and stacking blocks involves tackling a whole suite of new problems, Tobin says, like managing unfamiliar textures and replicating minute motor movements",tech
"Wojciech Zaremba, who leads OpenAIs robotics work, says that a holy grail of sorts would be a general-purpose robot powered by AI that can learn a new task  scrambling eggs, for instance  by watching someone do it just once This is why OpenAI is working on teaching robots new skills that are first demonstrated by a human in a simulated VR environment, much like a video game, where its much easier and less costly to produce and collect dataYou could imagine that, as a final outcome, if its doable, you have files online of recordings of various tasks, Zaremba says And then if you want the robot to replicate this behavior, you just download the fileWhen I first operated the Orb, on an April afternoon in Kindreds San Francisco warehouse space, a group of six or so engineers were scattered about testing the robotic arms with various pink-colored bins of products  vitamin bottles, soft plastic cylinders of Lysol cleaning wipes, rolls of paper towels",tech
"The Orb is designed to help sort these objects in a large heap inside its glass container, while the arm sits affixed to the roof of the container First, an operator wearing a VR headset moves the arm to a desired object, lowers the gripper, and adjusts the two clamps until a firm grip is established Then the human can simply let go",tech
"In any gigantic warehouse, people have to walk around and pick up things, says George Babu, Kindreds chief product officer",tech
"Amazon is working on something similar, and the company now holds an annual picking challenge to spur development in industrial robotics that are capable of handling and sorting physical items Kindred is quick to recognize Amazons prowess in this department In the fulfillment world, Amazon uses a different set of approaches than all of the other fulfillment provisioners They have the scale, the scope, and the know-how to implement end-to-end systems that are very effective at what they do, Rose says But he thinks Amazon is likely to keep this technology to itself",tech
"Kindreds system, on the other hand, is designed to integrate into existing warehouse tools",tech
"As for how the Orb might impact jobs, Babu says there will be need for human labor for quite some time",tech
"Still, Forrester Research predicts that automation will result in 25 million jobs lost over the next decade, with only 15 million new jobs created The end goals of automation have always been to reduce costs and improve efficiency, and that will inevitably mean the disappearance of certain types of laborKindred is unique in the AI field not just for its robotics focus, but also because its diving head first into the industrial world with a commercial product",tech
"Kindred, as a startup, cant afford this approach Day one we said: Were going to find a big market",tech
"That objective, since the beginning, is human-level AI with a focus on what Gildert calls in-body cognition, or the type of thought processes that only arise from giving AI a physical shell",tech
"Oppo is planning on unveiling its latest flagship phone on June 10th, but whatever they announce wont be much of a surprise, thanks to an ongoing stream of substantial leaks In the latest news that Android Pure has obtained are the official renders for the Oppo R11, and RayArena obtained a short video of a working version of the deviceThe R11 will be available in at least four colors that weve seen: gold, rose gold, silver, and black",tech
"What I see when I look at the Essential Phone  as a product rather than as a pretty gadget  is the potential to establish a new manufacturing approach for smart devices At present, economies of scale dominate the mobile industry  every Chinese company finding success in this market finds it by selling huge volumes at razor-thin margins",tech
"But these days being small is no longer a reason to give up (or, in Essentials case, to not try at all) It seems like almost every week Im discovering a new small-scale American company thats finding profitability by producing a low volume of high-margin, premium goods",tech
Essential can also dedicate more time to investigating more exotic materials and securing less conventional supply sources,tech
Last years reinvention of Motorola centered around the short-lived buzz over modular smartphones,tech
"This years version, the $499 Moto Z2 Play, available unlocked and through Verizon this summer, attempts to improve upon the first versions weaknesses without losing the charm that made the original so appealing Its much thinner, much lighter, has a better camera, and comes with a refined design and a handful of new software features It also works with all of the Mods Motorola has released  battery packs, projectors, cameras, speakers, and so on  and will release this year",tech
"As a regular user of last years phone, the first thing that I noticed with the Z2 Play is how thin and light it is This is not a small phone  it has a traditional 5",tech
"Of course, the reason the Z2 Play is so thin and light is because its battery is almost 15 percent smaller than the cell in last years model Theres reasonable cause for concern here; after all, the best feature in the Z Play was its battery life",tech
"Im okay with the trade-off Motorola made reducing the thickness and weight of the phone by using a smaller battery The battery life is still very good  Im not constantly thinking about it or monitoring it  and the phone is much slimmer and more comfortable to use as a result And since the Z2 Play is compatible with the Moto Mod platform, if I do need to extend its range away from the outlet, its very easy to slap on a battery mod, such as the new TurboPower Pack, and keep going",tech
"I also appreciate the other hardware improvements Motorola made here The phones appearance is not much different than last year  the Moto Mods system has essentially locked Motorola into a specific design for a couple of generations  but its a little more polished and refined The glass back, which was prone to scratching and damage, has been swapped for a more durable and more attractive metal finish, and the front fingerprint scanner is larger and recessed, making it easier to use",tech
"Motorola has also upgraded the camera hardware with a faster lens and much faster focusing systems It is a better camera than last years version, but even though the spec sheet is very good, the image processing doesnt keep pace with the Pixel, iPhone, or Galaxy S8 cameras The Z2 Play can struggle with high-contrast scenes, and its lack of optical stabilization really hurts it in low light Its not a bad camera at all, but its merely passable instead of greatThe performance from the Snapdragon 626 processor and 4GB of RAM is also fine: this isnt blisteringly fast like high-end phones with Qualcomms best chips, but it doesnt have any stutters or performance issues either",tech
"Still, the Z2 Play provides a great mix of what matters without any unnecessary stuff piled on And it does so with better battery life than even most flagships can provide When you think about it, isnt that all you really want from a phone?Motorola has announced the Moto Z2 Play, a successor to last year's sleeper hit Moto Z Play Much like its predecessor, the Z2 Play is a midrange smartphone with a 55-inch display and compatibility with the Moto Mod accessory platform",tech
"Of the new Mods, the TurboPower Pack and GamePad are the most interesting",tech
"Motorola has committed to launching at least a dozen new Mods this year and it still has a number of phones in its lineup that havent yet been updated for 2017, so we should hear more from the company as the summer progresses Until then, be sure to check out our full review of the Moto Z2 Play for more info",tech
"Its got space for more than 4,000 employees, a rooftop garden with a running track, and has been dubbed a landscraper for being as long as a skyscraper is tall Its Googles new London headquarters, the final plans of which were submitted this week to Camden council after years of back-and-forth between the tech giant and architects",tech
Construction on the Zone A development will start in 2018 at a site overlooking Londons Kings Cross railway station,tech
"In a statement, designer Thomas Heatherwick said hed been inspired by the site of the new office, which functions as a hub for much of the citys transport linksThe area is a fascinating collision of diverse building types and spaces and I cant help but love this mix of massive railway stations, roads, canals and other infrastructure all layered up into the most connected point in London, said Heatherwick Influenced by these surroundings, we have treated this new building for Google like a piece of infrastructure too, made from a family of interchangeable elements which ensure that the building and its workspace will stay flexible for years to comeInside will be all the amenities youd expect, like cafes and meeting rooms, as well as a three-lane, 25-meter swimming pool, massage rooms, a multi-use games area for spots like basketball and football, and a 210-seat auditorium for product announcements and talks The roof will be covered in a 300-meter-long garden, divided into different zones, including a pause area filled with wildflowers and woodland plants, a cafe, and a 200-meter trim trail for runners",tech

"The company recommitted to the project following Brexit last year, with CEO Sundar Pichai saying: Here in the UK, its clear to me that computer science has a great future with the talent, educational institutions, and passion for innovation we see all around us We are committed to the UK and excited to continue our investment in our new Kings Cross campusIf a nuclear-tipped missile were hurtling toward the United States, would we be able to stop it? Maybe, if we were very lucky But some experts warn that the United States missile defense system isnt as reliable as people might thinkRight now, a constellation of sensors and 36 interceptor missiles make up the ground-based midcourse defense system, or GMD",tech
"Still, its the only defense we have against an intercontinental ballistic missile or ICBM once its in the air On May 30th, 2017, the US tested these defenses against an ICBM-like target for the first time To stop it, a ground-based interceptor missile fired from Vandenberg Air Force Base collided with the incoming warhead and smashed it to smithereens",tech
"The test appears to have been a success  but that doesnt necessarily mean the GMD could stop an enemy weapon under real-world conditions In fact, the Government Accountability Office  a nonpartisan government agency also known as the congressional watchdog  reported in 2016 that the GMD has not demonstrated through flight testing that it can defend the US",tech
"We dont really know Since 1999, the GMD has been tested 18 times But the Union of Concerned Scientists argues that these were conducted under artificial conditions where the timing of the incoming missile, for example, was known in advance",tech
"For decades the US went back and forth about whether, and how, to defend itself against incoming missiles Ever since the US developed the atomic bomb in 1945, our best defense has been the prospect of devastating nuclear retaliationBut to supplement this game of nuclear chicken, the Army asked Bell Labs in 1955 to start looking into possibilities for an antiballistic missile system Since then, the US very briefly deployed nuclear-tipped interceptors designed to stop incoming missiles in their tracks with a nuclear explosion In the 80s, Ronald Reagan announced his famous Star Wars plan  which included a proposal for an X-ray space laser powered by a nuclear detonation (it never got off the ground)",tech
An anti-ballistic missile treaty signed by the US and the Soviet Union in 1972  plus scientific and technological challenges  stopped us from getting serious about defending against an ICBM attack There was also the concern that a sophisticated defense system could fuel a race for weapons that could overpower itThe Clinton administration started making moves toward a National Missile Defense in the 1990s,tech
"Because interceptors were rushed out before rigorous testing, the Missile Defense Agency had to go back and fix them as flight tests uncovered issues And those fixes have been both expensive, and incremental  so not all the missiles have the same hardware, according to a 2014 report by the Pentagons director of Operational Testing It went on to say: The reliability and availability of the operational [ground based interceptors] is low, and the MDA continues discovering new failure modes during testing",tech

"Netflixs chief executive officer has made no secret of the fact that hed like movies to come to Netflix almost as soon as theyre released in theaters Today at Recodes Code Conference, he offered a rather optimistic view of how people will still have their in-theater experience and stream it, too: by likening the theater experience to going out to dinner, as opposed to cooking at homeDuring an onstage interview with Recodes Peter Kafka, Hastings said he thinks its inevitable that the current window system breaks down, referring to theatrical release systems, the time period before movies come to DVD and eventually become available as home rentalsTypically, that window  which industry insiders refer to as the dark zone  can last up to 90 days In recent years, some studios have considered shortening the window to two weeks, as the film industry adjusts to shrinking DVD sales and consumers binge-watching habits at home",tech
"But its also not surprising that Hastings would attempt to offer a diplomatic response to a hard question about what the real future of distribution is At a press event at Netflix headquarters back in March, Hastings emphasized to journalists that hes not anti-theater, just that he wants innovation and growth in the movie market and to explore other kinds of distribution strategiesPerhaps a more revealing remark is what Hastings said at Code Conference today when asked whether Netflix would launch its own movie theater chain: no plans to do so, he said, adding that TVs are getting so good that it makes little senseSpeaking with Recodes Peter Kafka at the Code Conference today, Netflix CEO Reed Hastings explained his position on the current net neutrality debate thats happening at the FCC Or, more to the point, he addressed the fact that hes been awfully quiet about it compared to how loudly he defended net neutrality in previous fights",tech
"Its not narrowly important to us because were big enough to get the deals we want, Hastings said It was a candid admission: no matter what the FCC decides to do with Title II, Netflix isnt worried about its ability to survive Hastings says that Netflix is weighing in against changing the current rules, but that its not our primary battle at this point and we dont have a special vulnerability to it",tech
"He does believe that smaller players are going to be harmed if net neutrality goes away, saying that where net neutrality is really important is the Netflix of 10 years agoPerhaps another reason Netflix is being a little quieter about fighting to keep current net neutrality rules is that Hastings knows its already a lost cause His best guess at what will happen is exactly what FCC chair Ajit Pai has been hinting at: It might be that ISPs just accept the principles [of net neutrality] and its not enshrined formally, he said I think the FCC is going to unwind Title II, he added later And he believes that its in the ISPs long term interest to respect net neutrality principles, so maybe theyll just do it on their own",tech

Fuck you #Snapchat! How do I change it back to a picture of me?    pictwittercom/NFhzSvNrdmSnapchat pushing Bitmoji makes sense, in a way  it bought the cartoon avatar company for over $100 million last year, so its logical that Snap would want to make the most of that investment by putting Bitmoji everywhere in the app",tech

NASAs Juno spacecraft has been orbiting Jupiter for nearly a year now  and the space probe is revealing the gas giant to be more complex and surprising than we ever thought,tech
"Junos instruments show that massive cyclones dominate the planets poles, while a deep tropical band of ammonia circles its equator Meanwhile, the planets magnetic field is turning out to be much stronger than expected and the gravity field is indicating that Jupiters interior core may not be super dense All these findings, published in two new studies today in Science, as well as 44 in the journal Geophysical Research Letters, will eventually help planetary scientists piece together the structure of Jupiter",tech
"These new tantalizing clues about Jupiter were gathered by Juno during the its first couple of passes by the planet Right now, Juno is in an extremely elliptical orbit, which brings the probe screeching by Jupiters surface for a few hours at a time during each trip around the planet These passes, known as Perijove passes, bring Juno over the planets poles  closer than any previous vehicle has gone before And its during these swings by Jupiter that Juno gathers the bulk of its dataCurrently Juno does one Perijove pass every 53 days, though the original plan was one pass every 14 days",tech
"These cyclones make Jupiters poles a fairly unique place Neither pole has the same number of storms or configurations, according to Bolton, and they look very different from the poles of Saturn",tech

"They have, as is now glaringly obvious, serious consequences for individuals and society And these consequences are a result of private deliberations behind closed doors Corporations regulate speech all day, every day Silicon Valley may not have anticipated the scale, costs, and implications of moderation, but many others, like UCLAs Sarah T Roberts, have been trying to raise public awareness and demand greater corporate transparency for years",tech
"Where does Facebook go from here? Solutions remain elusive, but there are several consistent suggestions weve heard from observers:Build a tech fixThere is currently an industry-wide focus on the use of algorithms to solve the problem of moderation But algorithms are learning machines that rely on inputs and past behavior, often turning the is into the ought, at scale",tech
"Facebook and others keep telling us that machine learning is going to save the day, says Hany Farid, professor and chair of computer science at Dartmouth and a senior advisor to the Counter Extremism Project He developed the groundbreaking photoDNA technology used to detect, remove, and report child-exploitation images Farid says that his new technology, eGlyph, built on the conceptual framework of photoDNA, allows us to analyze images, videos, and audio recordings (whereas photoDNA is only applicable to images) But a better algorithm cant fix the mess Facebooks currently in This promise is still  at best  many years away, and we cant wait until this technology progresses far enough to do something about the problems that we are seeing online",tech
"Spend more money and hire more peopleIn response to recent criticism, Facebook announced that it was hiring an additional 3,000 moderators, on top of the 4,500 individuals it already employs worldwide, to take down questionable content More moderators, the argument goes, could better handle the fire hose of abusive and damaging, offensive content But there is no magic number of people that will stem the flow of violent, hateful, and threatening content, even if they are able to respond more quickly to reports Adding and supporting moderators, while critical, has nothing to do with the process of deciding what is acceptable contentRegulate platforms more heavilyIn the United States, companies like Facebook are highly unregulated when it comes to user-generated content",tech
"Nicco Mele, a technologist, former deputy publisher of the Los Angeles Times, and now director of the Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy at the Harvard Kennedy School, argues that Facebook is a media company because it derives almost all of its revenue from advertising, by monetizing its audience attention Media companies, he wrote in an email, have special responsibilities to the public good because of their unique power to shape public opinionThe recent attention to Facebooks moderation fails, he says, increases the likelihood that Facebook will need to put in place new methods of managing the content published on their platform; the company already does this around some kinds of content (child pornography, for example) In my assessment, the company is far from the level of monitoring and infrastructure their platform requires to meet its obligations to the public  and consequently a likely increase in headcount and expenditures is in its future The longer the company puts off self-policing, the more likely regulation becomes",tech
"Mele believes regulation could mean many things for consumers We have a long history of regulating media in different ways  remember Janet Jacksons Super Bowl halftime fashion mishap? Or more recently, Stephen Colberts unfortunate use of the word [cock] holster on late-night television? The Federal Communications Commission, he notes, monitors and regulates broadcast media, so, there is a precedent that any regulation could follow The movie industry, facing potential regulation, voluntarily adopted the parental rating system",tech
"For now, its all but inconceivable that Mark Zuckerberg will ever call Facebook a media company or a publisher Early on, he described Facebook as an information infrastructure He has recently used the term social infrastructure instead, as reported by Sarah Kessler, an expression that evokes such public service functions as the USPS or public housing",tech
"Theyve been trying to contain this problem, real and significant, for a long time, says Roberts, but its no longer containableWe are grateful to whoever took the significant risk to share documents Facebook has worked so hard for so long to keep under wraps, as we are grateful to the moderators, community managers, and senior executives who risked their jobs to talk to us about their hard work For now, in the words of Hany Farid, Here we are in crisis mode Facebook and others, he says, have been dragging their feet for years to deal with what they knew was a growing problem There is no doubt that this is a difficult problem and any solution will be imperfect, but we can do much better than we have",tech

"Rumors are flying that Apple is developing some kind of wearable that would continuously track the users blood sugar without breaking their skin For people with diabetes, this would be a huge improvement over the somewhat invasive or downright painful options they currently rely on But experts warn that if the rumors are true, Apple will be facing a scientific and technological battlefield littered with decades of other companies failures",tech
"If Apple is chasing a needleless blood sugar monitor, it wouldnt be that surprising (Apple declined to comment) After all, the market would be massive",tech
"Right now, its also unpleasant People with diabetes have to prick their fingers to draw blood, or wear a monitor that inserts a tiny tube beneath their skin to continuously measure glucose in the fluid between cells (the same fluid that spills out when you pop a blister) So a needleless device  preferably one that continuously monitors glucose levels and spits them out in real time  would be a huge upgrade",tech
"That is the holy grail, says Eric Topol, the director of the Scripps Translational Science Institute who also sits on the board of glucose monitor manufacturer Dexcom And thats why so many before Apple have made the attempt Google tried to develop a contact lens to detect glucose in tears, but ever since pharmaceutical giant Novartis licensed the technology in 2014, the projects gone quiet (A spokesperson for Alcon, a division of Novartis, told The Verge in an email: Were working together to initiate larger clinical trials in the near future, but do not have a definitive timeline to share today)Its an incredibly difficult problem, says Mark Rice, an anesthesiologist and diabetes expert at Vanderbilt University",tech
"The first problem is that theres only about a sugar packets worth of glucose floating through the blood, writes expert John L Smith in his book The Pursuit of Noninvasive Glucose: Hunting the Deceitful Turkey So, theres not a lot of glucose to measure from the outset",tech
"In fact, both tests are not always perfectly accurate: the test strips can go off if theyre not stored correctly; common drugs like Tylenol can interfere with the chemical reaction; and microorganisms and tissue can gunk up the sensor in a continuous monitor",tech
Some have tried to get to that blister-filling liquid under the skin without using a needle,tech
"Technically yes, but again, its hard  right now, there arent any FDA-approved noninvasive glucose trackers The two main methods attempted so far have been unsuccessful One way to measure glucose through the skin is to monitor something that changes as result of blood sugar fluctuations  like how much light reflects off of your skin, for example",tech
"Then, once the device is on the market, there are still challenges to overcome Bonnette guesses that a noninvasive monitor would initially only be available with a prescription So that means that the company making the device will need to convince insurers to pay for it",tech

"Over a series of phone interviews, Hammer declined to divulge how much money Super Deluxe gets from Turner Hammer says they dont have an annual budget from Turner  just a pot of money that gets replenished if they do wellAnd if they dont? Well, then were out of luck, and theres no more Super DeluxeIn the meantime, Hammers ambitions are grand  and he wields the power and jargon to match He brushes off an employees comparison to Walt Disney, but says, If you want to say that we aspire to be vertically integrated like the largest entertainment company the world has ever seen thats probably true",tech
The looming question now is whether Hammer can bring all these pieces together into a package that appeals to a large audience,tech
"Hammer says Super Deluxe is averse to noise, but their content belies that assertion, both figuratively and literally: they made the easy Oscars Best Picture fuck-up remix just like everyone else; their go-to sound effects are literally air horns and screams",tech
"Super Deluxe is everywhere and nowhere, taking credit for things when they feel like it, eschewing it if it seems like itll be more fun that way Sometimes Super Deluxe even goes out of its way to obfuscate its involvement, like it did when its tech team spurred the short-lived rumor that Drake and Rihanna were about to drop a collaborative album by launching drakeandrihannacom According to Hammer, theres no reason all these seemingly unrelated projects shouldnt exist side by side  theres no brand identity more compelling than complete creative freedomTo build that brand, Hammer borrowed a little bit of something old",tech
"In the old model of self-made online success, the only way to make money was to make a lot of free content for indifferent platforms like YouTube and Twitter, accrue followers, then hope and pray that someone would grant you a book deal or a part in a commercial You could have millions of fans and still subsist on Top Ramen",tech
"Super Deluxe isnt the first to consider paying young people to do the stuff theyre already doing for free Plenty of others have tried to do the same, operating under the assumption that throwing money at a rising internet star is enough to jumpstart success and mass appeal",tech
"Only a few creators have managed to truly break through, unaltered  the remarkably driven Hannah Hart, the creator of My Drunk Kitchen; or the Fine Brothers, who maintain a YouTube channel with 15 million subscribers and managed to launch their own production companySuper Deluxe has a new approach, one it thinks supports creatives and simultaneously holds corporate influence at arms length",tech
Kemp explains Super Deluxes role in the entertainment industry in buzzy startup terms: Were almost like an incubator,tech
"When Kemp first met with Stern and Feldman, she and her team were so impressed by their ideas and commitment that they offered to fund the web series on the spot Once signed, Kemp surrounded the creators with a production team, director Anna Kerrigan, a consultant from the Deaf West theater company, and her teams help selling the series for television",tech
"Watching the seriess shorts, its easy to see why Kemp found The Chances so exciting, as well as how much work there still is to do Stern and Feldman play best friends navigating bizarre, incredibly specific situations, from a UTI that causes Sterns character to pee at the table at her anniversary dinner, to an episode about clunky movie theater closed captioning devices, to a tender take on the someone accidentally got super high comedy trope",tech
"The Chances is an opportunity for Super Deluxe to prove that its soul is really where Hammer and Kemp and Pearson insist it is Were always looking for fresh and unique perspectives, from Vic Berger to Joanne, says Kemp We always bring it back to What does this particular creator have to say? How is it going to ripple through the society at large, and hopefully make some kind of impact or be a point of conversation? I just feel like thats the spirit of everything that the company is making, at its core",tech
"Pearson echoes her, saying, Its kind of finding the right voices and tone and then letting them do what they do rather than mediating or editorializing too much on what they do Ive always leaned toward the voice that speaks in the margins, because I believe thats where the future is made Hammer takes it even further: This idea that you have pieces like [The Chances] living next to some of the pieces we make for Live or Snapchat or YouTube  that breadth is unparalleled It doesnt exist",tech
"But The Chances wont premiere until early next year, and in the meantime Super Deluxe has to shop its other shows around and hedge its bets",tech
"Theyre doing that with an ever-widening roster of YouTube videos, Facebook Live interactive stunts, apps, mobile games, an aggressively irreverent social media presence, and, of course, a go at an Adult Swim-esque TBS late-night block",tech
"Facebook Live is a venue where Super Deluxe excels The tech team, led by CTO Shahruz Shaukat, has built its own box of tools that supplement what Facebook provides, allowing them to make their shows far more interactive than videos made by most other brands",tech
"Kevin Reilly, the chief creative officer of Turner Entertainment says hes proud of the work Super Deluxe has done so far, explaining, We started Super Deluxe to create unique experiences for a discerning consumer of video on social It has obviously done that On the other hand, Richard Greenfield, a media and tech analyst at the investment firm BTIG, told me he was impressed by what Super Deluxe is attempting But, bottom line: Theres no clear path to Super Deluxe making billions of dollars Most of the traditional media companies make tens of billions of dollars",tech
"Thats not to say Super Deluxe cant be successful Their advertising business is just getting off the ground, and theyve got the audience everyone wants Though it might seem risky building infrastructure around untested talent, the process is ultimately pretty lean And having total editorial independence from their principal benefactor gives Super Deluxe the freedom to avoid the standard pitfalls of entertainment production  costly rewrites, staffing change-ups, projects killed on the vine, ideas that get bloated and rendered amorphous by a cacophony of contributing voices Everyone who works there prides themselves on speed, and saving young talent from development hell",tech
"If Super Deluxe is the future of entertainment, its because it isnt much like a TV channel or a media company",tech

"The Worksafe report not only outlines an array of worrisome data of Teslas past, it also questions whether the companys recent claims of improved safety are accurate or believable",tech
"Among the highlights at the Fremont factory that employs 10,000 workers:Meanwhile, Tesla is trying to direct attention to its progress",tech
"We may have had some challenges in the past as we were learning how to become a car company, but what matters is the future and with the changes weve made, we now have the lowest injury rate in the industry by far, a Tesla spokesman said in an emailed statement",tech
The data analyzed and reported by Worksafe suggests Tesla has a long way to go before it will achieve that goal The report also questions the companys recent claims of lowering injury rates at the factoryTesla published a blog in May highlighting improvements to its safety record and warning that the latest phase of UAWs campaign to organize workers involves a concerted and professional media push intended to raise questions about safety at Tesla The blog boasted that the factorys injury rates were 46 injuries per 100 workers through the first quarter of 2017  32 percent better than the industry average of 6,tech

"Todays study also lasted only 14 weeks, so we dont know how long the benefits last, or whether there are any long-term effects Participants also all took the same dosage, so we dont know whether a higher dose would be more effective or, on the other hand, whether a lower dose would be equally effective but cause fewer side effectsAll these questions will be addressed in future studies, Friedman says",tech

"In addition to this, the program would detect a passengers mood through visual and audio cues  in the video, an attendant sees them go from calm to anxious and back again Of course, its not clear whether HoloLens could pick this up better than an actual human, and the whole facial recognition process seems far more complicated than Air New Zealands previous biometric bag drop system, which matched faces to scanned passports Theres also the matter of this generation of HoloLens being ridiculous-looking and uncomfortable, and interactions being a little difficult  later in the video, you can see someone getting trained to perform the signature air tap gesture",tech

"This shadowban, as spotted by The Next Web, effectively shoves players into a neutered version of the game, where they cant see rare spawns Last August, Niantic began issuing permanent bans to players who violated its terms of service Players were punished for acts such as using emulators, using modified or unofficial software, falsifying their locations, or accessing Pokmon Go clients or backends via third-party apps The choice was controversial among players, as it also crippled third-party services like PokVision, a map that helped users locate pokmonUsers on The Silph Road subreddit, a community of Pokmon Go players, say affected accounts arent being banned outright, theyre just being flagged as illicit",tech

"Tesla is judged more like a student  in marking periods, at the discretion of its critics The recent nick and partial restoration of Teslas standing with Consumer Reports is more than just another bump in the up-and-down relationship between the rating organization and the electric automaker",tech

"Last week, the Federal Communications Commission voted to start a proceeding to repeal the 2015 network neutrality rules and the legal authority underlying it, Title II of the Communications Act of 1934 The rules ensure that internet users can access the online content and services of their choosing without interference from ISPs like Comcast, AT&T, Verizon, and Charter",tech
"Yesterday the FCC made its final proposal to repeal the rules public This document, known as a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, or NPRM, is nearly identical to the draft Chairman Ajit Pai made public on April 27th",tech
"The second half purports to re-evaluate the existing net neutrality rules, the mechanisms that enforce them and any legal authority (other than Title II) that could be used to support them The FCC majority proposes to eliminate the general conduct standard, which prohibits ISP practices that unreasonably interfere or unreasonably disadvantage the ability of consumers to access the online content and services of their choosing, and the ability of online content and service providers to freely access customers",tech
"For example, the NPRM asks about ways in which consumers were harmed prior to the 2015 decision, referring to only four articulated examples of harm from discriminatory ISP actions The NPRM then asks: Do these isolated examples justify the regulatory shift that Title II reclassification entailed? Do such isolated examples constitute market failure sufficient to warrant pre-emptive, industry-wide regulation? These inquiries are hardly objective",tech
"The NPRM first proposes to eliminate the general conduct standard, which ensures protection from discriminatory conduct not captured by the other bright line rules, including new practices in which an ISP might engage in the future Making clear its intentions, the FCC majority seek[s] comment on whether eliminating this vague standard will spur innovation and benefit consumers",tech
"Most telling is the NPRMs discussion of the most likely source of authority, Section 706 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 Section 706 requires the FCC to 1) encourage deployment of broadband on a reasonable and timely basis by utilizing a number of different regulatory mechanisms, and 2) eliminate barriers to broadband deployment if it finds broadband is not being deployed on a reasonable and timely basisWhile the federal courts on several occasions have upheld Section 706 as an independent grant of legal authority for certain broadband rules (for example, rules that require mobile wireless providers to enter into data roaming agreements), the majority asks if better reading of the law is that the language is not a grant of authority but merely hortatory (encouraging) It appears the majority intends to adopt an interpretation of Section 706 that would render it largely useless, leaving the FCC without any ability whatsoever to oversee the broadband marketThe discussion of the impact of reclassification on privacy and Lifeline is brief",tech
"The majority also concludes without much discussion that its ability to support broadband with Lifeline funds is not jeopardized Not that it would care much if Lifeline was endangered  Chairman Pai has made clear in word and deed that he dislikes the program Interestingly, the NPRM does not ask whether the universal service program that provides subsidies to rural ISPs would be at risk under the majoritys proposal The chairman has made providing such subsidies a cornerstone of his FCC agendaIve painted a bleak picture of the NPRM and the outcome its authors are driving toward",tech

This was also not covered in the film,tech
"But is that really true? David never seems to have shared Elizabeths interests in meeting the Engineers, and his last encounter with one of them resulted in him getting his head ripped off With Elizabeth safely in stasis, he may have planned all along to betray her, to preserve his own life, and forward his own agenda, rather than accepting hers",tech
"And sadly, the final moments of the film, with David triumphantly sealing Dani and Tennessee into their status capsules and planning their deaths, may parallel what he did with Elizabeth Maybe there was never an argument between them about what to do over the Engineers He may have just sealed her away and then murdered her, because in spite of her kindness, her goals were never compatible with his",tech

"Lengthy stays on board the International Space Station dont seem to hurt sperm fertility In a new study, mice on Earth successfully gave birth to litters of pups after being fertilized with sperm that had been freeze-dried for nearly a year on the ISS Its potentially good news if, one day, animals and people will have to reproduce beyond Earth",tech

"To really understand the radiation risks, an experiment would need to be done beyond Earths protective magnetic shield But Tash says the only way reproduction in space can be made possible is if radiation-hardened facilities are created, to protect growing embryos from exposure Given the nine-month gestation for humans, the pregnant mother would also need to be protected by such a facility, he adds So it presents very real habitat, medical, social, and psychological questions that need to be addressed as wellBut for now, Donoviel says we really need to study if a baby can even grow in a microgravity environment",tech

"Video by Andrew Dowd and Phil EspositoAudio by Andrew MarinoNearly eight months after the phone was announced, Mophie is introducing a battery pack for the Google Pixel XL",tech
"Steven Yang quit his job at Google in the summer of 2011 to build the products he felt the world needed: a line of reasonably priced accessories that would be better than the ones you could buy from Apple and other big-name brands These accessories  batteries, cables, chargers  would solve our most persistent gadget problem by letting us stay powered on at all times",tech
"Anker has since become the most popular brand of portable battery packs on AmazonPortable chargers had a bit of a standout moment last summer, when players of the wildly popular and battery-hogging Pokmon Go could be seen roaming the streets, their phones constantly plugged in",tech
Yang and his team started a company with the sole purpose of selling a better third-party accessory,tech
"The culprit is the fundamental science of lithium-ion batteries, which are tremendous at storing energy but only within limited size and capacity constraintsThe lithium-ion batteries we have today operate at about a fifth of their potential storage capacity, says Lynden Archer, a professor of chemical engineering at Cornell University",tech
That stagnation has allowed Anker to flourish,tech
It was a long and painful process,tech
"Critical to avoiding these pitfalls was Dongpong Zhao, Googles then-head of sales in China Zhao joined Anker in early 2012, and helped Yang build out the companys supply chain Anker was made up of around ten people at the time Think of it as a small family business instead of like an actual company, Yang says The company tirelessly built out a supply chain in its first year and began testing its first products  the laptop chargers and batteries it would begin selling direct to consumers on Amazon",tech
"From there, Anker ventured into smartphone batteries with a replacement unit for the HTC Sensation We were able to make cellphone battery cells that actually had slightly better capacity, Yang says",tech
"For the accessories market, which tends to piggyback off trends in mainstream consumer electronics, a true breakthrough is rare But Anker found one in charging, based on the realization that while batteries may not be improving, charging time certainly was",tech
"Take the PowerPort 5, a matte black rectangle no larger than a deck of playing cards, with five USB ports When it was first introduced in 2015, it was the only accessory on the market capable of charging five devices simultaneously at optimal speed Or the companys standard PowerCore portable charger, roughly the size of a credit card and just under one inch thick  a white block encasing 10,000mAh of lithium-ion battery cells It has four pinholes that light up in LED blue when you press an elliptical button on the top to check its remaining charge It can refill a depleted iPhone 7 in just over 60 minutes nearly four times over before it needs to be recharged",tech
"Most Anker charging products have one signature: the PowerIQ logo Launched in 2013, the companys proprietary charging standard is now present on nearly all of its batteries and wall plugs",tech
"Beside its red cables, which Anker offers in both standard and braided nylon versions, and a single one-off red battery pack, the company sells products in only two color options: black and white All this has a strategic business purpose When our consumers receive our products, we want to make sure they know they are getting it from a reliable and trustworthy company, Lu says",tech
"My feeling is that Anker is a success because Apple offers such subpar and expensive accessories, says Stern, whos often recommended Anker products in her WSJ column It may be surprising that Apple sat idly as the accessory market ballooned around it; it took the company years to develop its own battery case for the iPhone to compete with Mophie But Apple has always favored high margins on premium products, even the cables and earbuds it sells in the Apple Store",tech
"This has given ample room to companies like Anker, with the low overhead of an e-commerce business, to sell similar products of near-identical quality for $10 to $20 cheaper And where Apple and others failed to develop products of their own like multi-port wall plugs and portable chargers, Anker saw the opportunity and capitalized on it The company is quick to fill gaps created by smartphone manufacturers",tech
"If you head over to Amazoncom right now and peruse the retailers most popular smartphone accessories and youll find Anker products at the top Search for a generic accessory like cellphone wall charger or Lightning cable and youll find the Anker brand high up in the search results, typically with a 45 or 5-star rating In fact, Anker products take up the first five slots on Amazons list of best-selling portable batteries",tech
Anker has never aspired to such grand ambitions,tech
"The companys focus on storefront retail is a response to a second very real threat  dependence on a direct-to-consumer, online-only model The company has found it difficult these days to launch new products on Amazon Older products have thousands of reviews, while newer ones need to earn placement in the search rankings and collect testimonials before more cautious buyers pull the trigger",tech
"The company is also struggling with its complex product line, with a dizzying number of choices that may alienate consumers who are looking for a simple choice Were converging to this generation approach, Yang says",tech
"Mastodon isn't difficult, but it's different, and that has to click for people to get it, says Rochko",tech

"There are a handful of Mastodon instances Ive frequented since the initial mass migration; all of the moderators I spoke with for these instances noted an influx of users around early-to-mid April The largest of my personal instances is Mastodonxyz with more than 9,000 users (for reference, thats roughly a sixth the size of the flagship instance) The smallest I have a membership to is the Memetastic space, with just over 3,000 membersSimilar to Mastodon",tech

"At Google I/O this past week, I got my first taste of the next version of Android and I enjoyed almost everything about it Android has gotten to the stage where improvements come in only incremental steps, and Google is mostly making the right ones with its annual updates But I have an underlying worry about where this is all going: as Android grows more proactive and assistive, I fear it might end up alienating its more technically inclined usersSo heres a radical thought: maybe theres now room for more than one canonical variant of Android I can already hear the chorus of disagreement, chanting the word ""fragmentation"" with cautionary zeal, but Google is already working on a modified version with Android Go, its extra lean serving for lower-spec devices",tech
"Speaking with Android chief Hiroshi Lockheimer during Google I/O, I was told that the teams responsible for all of these apps make their decisions based on a lot of user research and (anonymized, he was quick to point out) data One of Androids outstanding challenges is informing people of everything the system can do, and the prompts for action from Googles apps are helpful pointers for neophytes",tech
"If cars can have a sport mode that stiffens the suspension, heightens throttle response, and disables driving assists for a purer and faster experience, why not phones, too? I want something like Android Go  barebones, simplified, streamlined to run as fast as possible  but with all the latest and greatest capabilities that Android can support All the torque, none of the training wheels",tech
"My idea for an Android Pro wouldnt meaningfully contribute to Androids long-unresolved issue of software fragmentation because the thing I envision is taking features away, not adding more I can live without Google Assistant and without Uber and Lyft being directly integrated into Maps Just give me the familiar single-purpose, siloed-off apps, and let me worry about connecting the dots between them Thats the way Android grew to its present popularity, and there are many of us already accustomed to highly effective workflows built atop its simple, un-enhanced structureAn Android Pro could also serve as a useful branding tool, giving Android OEMs an excuse not to mess around with creating their own skins and user assists, shipping Googles prepared code as it is, which could in turn accelerate updates and reinforce the idea of this being an OS for professionals",tech

It doesnt mean its an indictment and it doesnt need to be something we decide to work on, but its good information to haveYou say that one thing thats necessary for self-awareness is, paradoxically, letting go of the truth for absolute truth, and if we keep searching for that, it wont help us Why not?It goes back a lot to the Freud stuff",tech

"During my time playing the strike as a Dawnblade, the pools of damage-boosting/healing light were critical in taking down higher-level enemies and staying alive during particularly grueling parts of the three-stage boss fight We can expect every subclass to have some pretty unique abilities not dependent on a super charge, as Bungie seems intent on making the divisions between classes more pronouncedPerhaps the most noticeable change to how Destiny 2 looks and feels is in the weapons system",tech

"Its a delicate mix, and one I cant help but think Showtime executives would run from, screaming But in a way, its the truest example of what Twin Peaks became as it evolved My ultimate question going in is whether Lynchs new Twin Peaks will be able to hit that same kind of tonal balance, using both the familiar and the bizarre to disarm the audience, and lead us into truly emotionally devastating territory And if it can hit it, can it maintain it for 18 episodes? So much serialized TV has become focused on plotting and fan debate around story theories I would welcome a chance to just float on the tide of Lynchs mind",tech

"Hundreds of students across the district will now be creating applications and hardware projects, like robotics or websites, said Claire Shorall, who teaches calculus and computer science at Castlemont High School in Oakland and spearheaded the school districts computer science expansion I think what were going to see are ideas that havent yet entered the market, because students from diverse backgrounds will create things we havent seen before",tech

"This feels like a bit of an unfortunate choice, for two reasons: Blomkamps script was reportedly strong, but it also would have helped reboot the end of Ripleys story Alien 3 and Alien: Resurrection have both been widely condemned for the directions that they took the franchise: Joss Whedon, who wrote the original screenplay, said the filmmakers did everything wrong that they could possibly doThe images of Blomkamps concept included Ripley and Hicks post-Aliens, an Engineers ship in a cargo bay, and of course, the xenomorphs themselves",tech
"That attention is being spent right now on the origins of Alien, rather than going back to polish Ripleys story This could be down to simple practical reasons: it would be a marketing nightmare to introduce a new film on the heels of Alien: Covenant thats really a sequel to Aliens While standalone, out-of-continuity films are starting to be part of franchises, thanks to the success of Star Wars: Rogue One, its still a pretty newfangled concept from a franchise thats much bigger than Alien",tech

"For long stretches Alien: Covenant delivers on that promise Its a film full of terrifying, heart-pounding terror, on par with some of the best work in Scotts career But its also a movie stuck between modes, mixing that horror with the same pseudo-intellectual pondering that ground things to a halt last time The result is a film that is a welcome improvement over Prometheus, but perhaps not the home run that sci-fi and horror fans might have been hoping forWarning: mild spoilers for Alien: Covenant to follow",tech
"The film picks up 10 years after the events of Prometheus, with the ship Covenant making a years-long journey through space With 2,000 colonists in cryosleep and bevy of human embryos on board, its mission is to reach the distant planet Origae-6 and set up a new outpost, spreading humanitys reach across the galaxy Monitoring the ship during the trip is Walter (Michael Fassbender), an upgraded model of the synthetic human Fassbender played in the previous film",tech
"From the early moments of Covenant, its obvious that Scott and his collaborators want this movie to feel like an Alien film Themes from original composer Jerry Goldsmiths score surface early on, and the entire pacing of the film feels like a nod to what has come before (One sequence toward the end of the film even plays like a seven-minute supercut of the original) Meeting the crew of the Covenant only strengthens that connection Characters like the pilot Tennessee (Danny McBride), and his no-nonsense wife, Faris (Amy Seimetz) are human and relatable, calling back to the truckers in space vibe that made the original Alien such a novel break from sci-fi convention in the first place",tech
"When it comes time for the monsters to reveal themselves and wreak havoc, however, Scott doesnt just prove that hes still able to call upon the horror sensibilities that served him before He takes the opportunity to show off how much hes learned in the past 38 years, turning up the tension and squirm-in-your-seat anxiety to the point where its nearly unbearable at times One of the posters for Alien: Covenant features just the face of the infamous xenomorph along with the word run, and that juxtaposition perfectly encapsulates the films best moments",tech

"We discovered from data that the male and female wing bones are both transformed Theyre all extremely robust and wide and distinct The male with his weird wings at least gets the ability to sing interesting songs, but the female can never benefit from having these worse wing bones because she doesnt do the dance The female who has these weird bones never sings So how could this happen if all evolution was about making you better and better?I argue thats an indication that sexual selection can produce a kind of decadence, in which individuals become worse at their survival even as theyre more pleasing to each other",tech
"How could this happen? Is this the sort of process that leads to extinction?How could the female make herself worse? This can happen because the cost of her mate choice are deferred to her sons and daughters So by choosing the male that she likes that makes the cool wing-songs with his nifty wing-feathers, she gets sons that are going to be also attractive, but daughters with wing bones that are less equipped to fly",tech
"Yes, theoretically, that can lead to extinction This process can be halted, but only halted when there are direct costs to her own survival and fecundity, like if she suddenly doesnt live as long, or cant find a mate at all Then there would be sudden natural selection against preference and that could halt the processCan you go into more detail about the difference between adaptive selection, or the idea that every trait can be explained by how it helps you survive, versus the theory of aesthetic selection that you prefer, which says that some things just evolved arbitrarily because animals liked them?So, there are two theories: the adaptive one says that ornaments like a peacocks tail and preferences for it evolved because they provide objectively better mating opportunities The peacocks useless tail evolved because it tells you that the peacock must be really genetically healthy if it can have that handicap and still stay alive",tech
"Aesthetic selection says that these preferences co-evolve because of the pleasure they provide It argues that the animals subjective experience  not just external forces  can drive pleasure and can drive the evolution of ornament all by itself So a peacock can evolve to have a big tail because other peacocks like it, not because it signals that its objectively better in some genetic sense",tech

"First and foremost is the series long, troubling development process, which CBS seems to have completely mishandled from start to finish Things started out great for Discovery The show was first announced in 2015, and was set to premiere in January 2017, on the heels of Star Trek's 50th anniversary (In hindsight, the show having been planned from the start to miss that anniversary entirely may have been a bad sign)Pushing Daisies, Hannibal, and American Gods creator Bryan Fuller  one of the hottest creators in TV today  was announced as Discoverys showrunner",tech
J,tech
"But Discovery has been plagued by multiple delays  slipping from the January 2017 date to May, and then again from May to an indefinite release sometime in fall 2017",tech
"Also, comments from CBS Interactive CEO Jim Lanzone to Recodes Peter Kafka seem to indicate that the network just doesnt think science fiction works on TV anymore According to Lanzone, Sci-fi is not something that has traditionally done really well on broadcast Its not impossible, for the future, if somebody figures it out But historically, a show like Star Trek wouldnt necessarily be a broadcast show, at this pointNetwork concerns aside, fans have expressed some misgivings about the style of the show, based on the footage weve seen so far",tech
"But it's worrying that Discovery is returning yet again to the creative well of the original series Kirk/Spock era, instead of breaking new ground in another area of the universe Between the 1960s Trek and its associated movies, the 2009 reboots, and now Discovery, it's the third major return to this time period Which means Discovery could run into the same problems that any prequel has, in that we largely know what happens to this universe next, at least on a larger scale",tech

"Sweet notes, however, two caveats to keep in mind The first is that only 21 years of data was used to calculate the probability of events that occur once every 50 or so years The short time span means that its harder to get a true sense for which events are common, and which ones are rare Vitousek acknowledges that this is a challenge with studying extreme events because fortunately, they dont happen very often Wed love more data, he says",tech
"The second is that sea levels dont actually rise evenly around the globe So, it will take more number crunching to figure out exactly when specific regions will hit the sea levels that tip the balance towards more frequent extreme floods Still, Sweet says, its a solid and important study",tech
"The dire predictions the study makes arent necessarily set in stone, Vitousek says If we start reducing carbon emissions, figure out a way to remove carbon from the atmosphere  or, preferably, both  we could keep extreme floods at bay It is a pretty sobering possibility, but there are things we can do to fix the problem, he says Still, Vitousek adds, Its going to be very difficult to make this happen without a lot of human interventionLater this year Bungie will release a sequel to the massively popular online shooter Destiny, and it looks to improve on the original in a number of ways",tech

"Indeed, Black Lightning and Supergirl share a creator in Greg Berlanti, who is heavily involved in the other Arrowverse shows Supergirl was initially separate when it began its life on CBS, but later joined the universe when it moved to The CW for its second season While Black Lightning is starting off its life outside of the Arrowverse, crossing over wouldnt be unheard of",tech

"The CWs Archie Comics for Gen-Y TV series, Riverdale, spent its first season ratcheting steadily toward the sky, eventually pulling in 2 million viewers per week and knighting its young stars as the new It kids of HollywoodAccording to a data dive published on Tumblrs staff-run Fandometrics blog, the show netted 15 million engagements (defined by Tumblr as searches, original posts, reblogs, and likes), and the #Riverdale tag was the 44th most popular across the entire site",tech
"According to Tumblr, about 29 percent of all current Riverdale conversation centers around the character of Jughead Jones Crucially, the character is played by Cole Sprouse, an unlikely personification of internet trends",tech
"I only started acting again so you guys wouldn't feel like you wasted money on the posters of me at 12CWs audience is eating it up, and several of the top Riverdale fan-fiction and fan-art bloggers point to the cult of Cole to explain the shows popularity on Tumblr Heaven, a fan who runs the popular Jarchie (Jughead and Archie) fan-art blog, explained, I'm on Instagram a lot, and lots of people were talking about how hot Cole Sprouse was",tech
"Riverdale has also instigated an outpouring of fan fiction  mostly speculative shipping of the dozens of possible romantic pairings inherent to a teen drama with an ensemble cast The most popular pairing is Bughead, Jughead Jones and Betty Cooper, a duo that generated about 51 percent of Tumblr conversation around Riverdale romances Theyre followed by Beronica, Betty and Veronica Lodge, a couple that made up 32 percent of Riverdale shipping posts But fans have invested time in every conceivable pairing, imagining relationships between Jughead and Archie; Veronica and Riverdale Highs queen mean girl, Cheryl Blossom; and Archie and Valerie Brown, one of the members of the girl band Josie and the PussycatsA rudimentary search for any of these ships will turn up dozens of blogs with fan-made art, slash fiction, treatises explaining the story logic and emotional resonance behind each pair, and GIF sets from the series that prove the couples undeniable chemistry",tech
"And Riverdale fan blogger Avrealyn points out, Everything about Riverdale, from its noir elements to its intriguing multi-dimensional characters, the beautiful cast, the fantastic quips and references and writings and storylines and perfect soundtrack choices, as well as the overall gorgeous aesthetics of the scenes to the colors and the outfits, makes such great fodder for fan fiction and fan art That sounds like fan hyperbole, but its true that nearly every scene of Riverdale is shot to look like a neon-hued poster Every frame makes a beautiful GIF, or suggests iterative illustrations",tech
"And the soundtrack is also calculated for maximum teen-fan impact The first music cue of the season is Santigolds Cant Get Enough of Myself  from her 2016 album 99, the first major music release handled almost exclusively by Tumblr  and the soundtrack only gets more blatantly market-tested and cool-teen-baiting from there The whole cast is active on Twitter, Snapchat, and Instagram, which gives bloggers even more material to work with",tech
"Fan art isnt a new phenomenon And fans write romantically charged fan fiction about essentially any piece of popular culture But Riverdale encourages it to a degree precedented only by a handful of other recent shows (The CWs Smallville, MTVs Teen Wolf), with a writers room thats more than familiar with the internet cultures that spring up around youth-oriented programming",tech
"For example, Archie Comics chief creative officer, Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa, who created the series for the CW and wrote several of its early episodes, also penned episodes for Glee",tech
"Andrea, an Italian fan who ships Jughead and Archie, writes, Im a gay guy and I look for a possible gay relationship to create for my head-canons in anything I watch or read In this case, the canon gay kid, Kevin, is not a character I particularly like Its not the portrayal of the character I would have liked to see  he wasn't so stereotyped in the comics",tech
"The Riverdale phenomenon is mildly interesting, especially considering its a first-season show on a network that has had almost no major successes in the last five years, outside of superhero shows But whats fascinating is the fandoms boldness, its intuitive understanding that the pieces of this show were built specifically to be played with",tech
"That kind of fandom is simultaneously the peak of loyalty and its antithesis Viewers are more invested in Riverdales characters and storylines than they are in the average TV show, but they also feel far more entitled to decide when the show hasnt delivered what they believe theyve been promised The fact that some of them would rather have their own version of Riverdale than the one that actually airs is telling",tech

"In a ruling today, the judge found that Facebook cannot be held liable for those accounts, dismissing two separate complaints brought on those grounds",tech
"The dismissal hinges on Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, the much-cited Safe Harbor clause that protects online platforms from many forms of liability",tech
"The result is a major vindication for Section 230 as it applies to terrorism cases Some legal experts have argued Section 230 may not protect platforms in cases of material support to terrorist groups, on the grounds that access to social networks provides a tangible communications benefit A number of lawsuits have sought to make that case, most recently against Twitter, but it has yet to find favor with the courts",tech

"The heart of this offering is Googles machine learning software TensorFlow For building AI tools, its like the difference between a command line interface and a modern desktop OS; giving users an accessible framework for grappling with their algorithms",tech
Google has made strategic moves to ensure the software is widely used,tech
"Other firms like Amazon, Facebook, and Microsoft also offer their own AI tools, but its Googles that feel pre-eminent Winiger thinks this is partly down to the companys capacity to shape the media narrative, but also because of the strong level of support it provides to its users",tech
"This influence isnt just abstract, either: it feeds back into Googles own products Yesterday, for example, Google announced that Android now has a staggering two billion monthly active users, and to keep the softwares edge, the company is honing it with machine learning New additions to the OS span the range from tiny tweaks (like smarter text selection) to big new features (like a camera that recognizes what its looking at)",tech
"But Google didnt forget to feed the community either, and to complement these announcements unveiled new tools to help developers build AI services that work better on mobile devices These include a new version of TensorFlow named TensorFlowLite, and an API that will interface with future smartphone chips that have been optimized to work with AI software Developers can then use these to make better machine learning products for Android devices Googles AI empire stretches out a bit further, and Google reaps the benefitsUpdate May 20th 06:30AM ET: Updated to clarify the use of TensorFlow by Ocado in building in-house tools",tech
"When word spread in 2016 that Google would move into serious virtual reality, not just disposable cardboard viewers, my colleague Dieter Bohn immediately put a couple of pieces together One was the need for headsets that could track motion without dedicated VR rooms full of cameras or markers",tech
"Google head of VR Clay Bavor describes the new headset as one point on a spectrum called immersive computing, an emerging technological paradigm that enables our computers to work more like we do His teams been working on this project for two and a half years, and Google is partnering with Qualcomm, HTC, and Lenovo to release a reference design and two commercial products based on it",tech
"The final headsets are supposed to cost about as much as high-end tethered products like the $599 Oculus Rift or $799 HTC Vive, but without the additional cost of a PC While thats a lot of money, its not drastically more expensive than what people might pay for a gaming console Theyre designed to make VR feel casual and accessible even to people who dont have Daydream-ready phones, especially people who arent interested in Android at all It turns out that a lot of people have iPhones, Bavor jokesMeanwhile, a rendering system called Seurat  named after the pointillist painter Georges Seurat  is supposed to offer image quality that rivals what youd get on a high-end PC",tech
"But for all that, the device Google describes doesnt feel like a finished product, or a direct competitor to tethered headsets",tech
"For the last few years, companies have all been building toward their first generation of mass-market (by virtual reality standards) headsets Success meant creating something that felt finished and ready to push out to millions of people",tech
Thirty three pages of posts on the official Samsung Community forum boil down to one simple request: please add an option to turn off automatic HDMI switching The first question was asked by CNMark in April of last year,tech
"Heres how CNMark kicked it off:Turn off auto-detect HDMIHow do you turn off the auto-detect HDMI feature? Sometimes my Apple TV comes on and then the TV automatically turns on as well but I don't want the TV to do so How do you turn off this feature?Thanks,MarkThe ""feature"" seems to be a new addition to 2016 models, but it's not well documented and the inability to turn it off sounds like a bug It's especially exacerbated by the Nintendo Switch, which causes these Samsung TVs and some other devices to switch over to its HDMI input randomly when it's in sleep mode At least this can be slightly fixed on the Switchs end by turning off the Match TV Power State setting, as a forum moderator helpfully points outOn the thread there are plenty of documented attempts to chat with Samsung support  no amount of resetting the firmware or toggling options seems to fix the core issue",tech

"Googles standalone VR headset, announced yesterday at I/O, was both obvious and unexpected People have been talking about a self-contained Google headset for over a year, and speculating (quite confidently) that the company would eventually use Tango augmented reality tracking in lieu of outside cameras",tech
"In the first of two demos, wearers could walk around a virtual ocean floor, complete with wandering jellyfish and a circling sea turtle The second put them in a large Imperial hanger from Rogue One, complete with a dour K-2SO Google doesnt give a hard limit for how much space one of its headsets can track, but I was stationed on a rug with a roughly one-meter radius for both; if I strayed outside it, the world was set to fade out",tech
"Tracking is supposed to improve the more you use the headset in a specific place, as WorldSense builds a better spatial image of it But Bavor promised that these prototypes had been set to start each demo fresh, as though they had never seen the room before (As he joked at one point, Google is showing us its standalone headset in the worst shape well ever see it",tech
"I cant say how well the prototype I saw works on any objective scale I tried it in a room with good lighting and lots of edges and textures, including a cross-hatched pattern on the rug below me In dimmer environments with less definition, it may not perform as well On the other hand, some imperfections might be due to the older hardware and higher latency Both demos had you move around a limited space with minimal interactivity, not a full-fledged virtual world",tech

The FCC has voted to begin undoing the net neutrality rules that were put in place just two years ago,tech
"In a 2-to-1 decision, the commission voted to open debate on what are essentially two things: first, a proposal to reverse the Title II designation used to enforce tough net neutrality rules on internet providers; and second, the question of whether the FCC ought to impose any kind of net neutrality rules at allTodays vote doesnt immediately undo the 2015 Open Internet Order Instead, it kicks off a public commenting period that will last for several months during which companies, interest groups, and advocates can file their thoughts with the FCC",tech
"When the comment period closes, likely later this year, the commission will then put forward a finalized proposal, theoretically taking into account those comments, and vote to put that into the rulebooks",tech

Internet providers and FCC chairman Ajit Pai have tried to separate what theyre doing here  updating the regulatory classification of internet providers  from net neutrality,tech

We chatted with Hillier about how he went about illustrating Lovecrafts unimaginable horrorsThis interview has been edited for length and clarity,tech
"What is your own relationship with Lovecraft? Are there any particular stories that you've enjoyed before this project?I've come to Lovecraft quite late, actually In fact, it was only in preparation for this project that I really got stuck in",tech
"Generally, I'll have a rough idea of what I want to make, or I'll have a single element from a print  a face, or a piece of landscape, or a texture  and will build the image around that, allowing the process of adding and removing whatever is found along the way until the picture clicks, and then it's a case of tightening up the whole until it worksOnce it's finished, I'll usually have it screen-printed",tech
"The main aim I had for the limited edition was that it would look like a dark and dangerous object, or one of the various mysteriously hieroglyphed items that crop up in Lovecraft's work, or even something like the Necromomicon, which appears in several of his storiesPhotography by Andrew Liptak / The VergeYesterday was the day Google was expected to announce the big new features coming to Android this year It had already announced some basics back in March, but the I/O conference is usually when we hear about the real highlights  the stuff consumers are actually going to look forward to But the presentation came and went, and the most exciting thing Android got was app notification badges Seriously",tech
"Barring any secrets Google is hanging onto, theres no denying that this is one of the outwardly duller Android releases in recent memory But the fact that Android O is missing flashy features is in many ways a great thing for users of Googles products: Google does have a ton of new features on the way  theyre just built into discrete apps instead of the operating systemAndroid O new features:If you zoom out from Android and look at the breadth of additions coming to Googles apps this year, its presentation yesterday becomes far more compelling: theres a camera that can analyze whatever its seeing, a photo tool that can remove objects from pictures, the ability to interact with apps and services by voice without ever installing them on your phone",tech
"Were Google to play the game like Apple, all of these features would be inseparable from its operating system But for Google, its far more important that people are using its apps and services wherever they are  Android, iOS, the desktop, or sitting in their living room So instead of building these features into a release of Android that will take years to reach a majority of users (the latest release, Nougat, is on just seven percent of Android devices), Googles biggest upgrades will go out to any device that can receive updates to Google Photos and the Google Assistant",tech
"This approach also stresses how important Google sees the Assistant becoming Google is well aware that the Assistant may be the future of Google Search  a core way that people look up information And the top features Google announced yesterday were about empowering the Assistant to help people look things up: the Google Lens lets the Assistant analyze objects just by pointing a camera at them, like looking up what flower youre seeing, and new APIs for developers will let the Assistant automatically reach out to third parties to get even more things done",tech
"These features would be exciting as additions to Android O But theyre a much bigger deal broken off and included inside the Assistant They build upon the core Google experience, and thats something even more people will be able to take advantage of",tech
"Google has also put a renewed priority on making sure that Android can run on a wide variety of devices, including on phones with basic specs and limited data access Building data-hungry features like Lens directly into the operating system would complicate that goal By separating these features from the OS itself, Google is able to maintain a simpler Android thatll scale better across the diverse ecosystem of devices its hoping to see the operating system on, potentially building a better experience for people using a more-limited phone",tech
"At the same time, the focus of this years Android release  what Google is calling your phones vitals  is dry but important positioning for the future Google says its reworked the operating system so that everything runs faster and puts less strain on a devices battery In a test yesterday, my colleague saw a Pixel running the Android O beta boot up more than twice as fast as a Pixel running Nougat",tech
"Perhaps the largest change to O is one we wont even experience until the following release of Android: Google claims its going to be much easier for phone makers like Samsung and HTC to ship future Android updates to their customers Thats one were really going to have to wait to see the results on  it can sometimes feel like theres been an eternal promise to fix the issue of slow Android updates  but if Google makes a difference this time, thatd be one of the most impactful changes it could bring to AndroidThis shifting focus to apps isnt unique to Google, either Apple largely had the same approach with iOS 10 last year  the only difference is that Apples apps are intrinsic to its operating system Just look at the list of updates: an overhaul to Messages, new sorting features in Photos, third-party integrations with Siri",tech
"If a deal eventually gets done, there are questions as to what SiriusXM can offer Pandora besides a bit more cash SiriusXM likely needs an on-demand streaming service as much as Pandora needs deeper pockets  as products like Android Auto and Apple CarPlay become more prevalent, more users will move away from traditional and satellite radio (SiriusXM) and rely on the apps on their phones (and thusly in their infotainment systems) like Apple Music, ESPN, and Pandora for their music and morning radio showsGiven the constant chatting these two companies have kept up since last year, a deal is still possible, but if SiriusXM is looking to acquire Pandora at a reduced cost like its parent company tried to do last year, this may not be resolved anytime soon",tech

"Now that Google Assistant has officially arrived to the iPhone (at least, for US-based users) a lot of people may be wondering why Google pushed the AI as a separate app from the main one Heres an overview of the differences between the twoWhile its not officially called Google Search (and rather, just its plain ol namesake), many people refer to it as such because thats essentially what the app is designed for iOS users can download the app to add a nice little search widget on their home screen, using it to quickly look up things as you would on the websiteYou can search on Google Assistant too, but Google says it wanted to keep the two apps separate because some people may not want the AI capabilities if theyre already happy and used to Siri",tech
"The Assistant will also gain third-party Actions, which allows you to control smart home gadgets or order food deliveries without leaving the app or manually entering an address and credit card numberThough Google Assistant is designed to take on Siri, there are several things it cannot do on an iPhone",tech
"Restrictions aside, once Google Lens arrives to the Assistant, youll have a much better contextual image search which includes things like taking a photo of the Wi-Fi router and automatically log in to the network, or hover the camera over a concert hall marquee to learn more about the band Its also going to bring on the Word Lens feature from the Translate app to help translate foreign languages Siri cant do all these things (not yet anyway) and neither can the iOS Google appWith Google Lens, your smartphone camera wont just see what you see, but will also understand what you see to help you take action #io17 pic",tech

"The usual caveats apply: this is a mouse study, and we havent tested the drug in humans",tech
"The team also took a look at other differences in the mice who got the molecule versus the ones who didnt Genes that break down fat for energy did more work in the mice with GW At the same time, genes that beak down carbs for energy did less work This makes sense, because its exactly what happens in real life: the bodies of really fit people typically burn fat for fuel instead of carbsAll this said, the mice that took the molecule didnt have any better muscles than the ones that didnt, so it seems like the benefits come from changing how their body breaks down energy",tech
"DxO is perhaps best known for the DxOMark benchmarking test that remains one of the most commonly cited metrics for camera performance on a smartphone (even though its important to remember that benchmarks never tell the full story), along with developing several pieces of professional photography software",tech
"OnePlus and DxO arent offering any details as to the nature of the collaboration, or even whether DxO is contributing to the hardware or software components of the OnePlus 5s camera A cynical-minded person could look at the partnership as OnePlus looking to ensure it scores highly on the DxOMark test  which OnePluss announcement does specifically call it out by name  but we dont know that for sure",tech

"Nvidia has a new graphics card out, the GT 1030  and unlike pricier options, it starts at just $69",tech
"The goal of the GT 1030 is to provide a cheaper, less powerful graphics card for gamers looking to get into competitive play on a budget As such, it offers relatively weak specs  2GB of onboard memory, and a core clock speed of 1265 MHz (which can boost to 1518 MHz) But thats enough to run a wide range of popular e-sport games  including Dota 2, Rocket League, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, or League of Legends  perfectly well",tech

"Today, Amazon is launching a new bestseller list called Amazon Charts, which will track the top 20 books that have sold the best on any given week and the 20 books being read the mostWhile Amazon already has a number of hourly bestseller lists across a broad range of genres, this list will provide a more stable snapshot of the weeks bestselling and best-read books The list will be broken into two broad categories: the top 20 books read and purchased in fiction and in nonfiction The list will incorporate data from three places: physical books bought through the sites storefront, Kindle books, and Audible audiobooks The list will track the sales, borrows, and preorders, in an attempt to present a look at what Amazons customers are reading",tech
"The team stressed that this list wasnt going to replace the numerous hourly lists present on the site that get broken down by category Rather, this new list will provide a week-long snapshot of sales and reading data",tech
"Bestseller lists are a huge tool used by readers and publishers alike Major lists like those found in The New York Times, LA Times, and other publications can lead to huge exposure and new sales for authors These lists are important, especially in specific categories, because of the exposure they bring",tech

"Vivint Solar has been around since 2011, but never expanded beyond solar panels and, through a sister company, smart home installations I wasnt interested in the chemistry associated with doing energy storage, Vivint Solar CEO David Bywater tells The Verge So we talked to a whole bunch of companies, and through this process we felt very strongly that Mercedes-Benz was the right partner for us",tech
"Von Bormann feels the same way Mercedes parent company Daimler has been selling its home batteries in Germany and the UK after announcing the product in 2015 But Mercedes was waiting for a partner that has a national footprint that has a high quality standard in their installation and in the way they present the company in the US, which von Bormann calls a key marketBoth von Bormann and Bywater think their companies can take advantage of the growing interest in solar energy despite the uncertainty the new administration has brought to the industry President Donald Trump recently signed an executive order to roll back the Clean Power Plan in favor of emphasizing coal, and another that could expand offshore drilling for oil and gas",tech
"The first Ryzen processors were released by AMD earlier this year, and were seen a major leap forward for the companys CPU offerings that actually managed to offer meaningful competition for Intels popular Core i5 and i7 models when it came to both price and performanceThe mobile Ryzen line, codenamed Raven Ridge, will be what AMD calls an APU  an accelerated processing unit, which combines a CPU and an integrated GPU into a single chip (similar to how Intel CPUs offer integrated Intel HD graphics) Like the desktop Ryzen processors, the mobile CPU components will be four-core, 8-thread chips based on the same Zen architecture AMD expects to see the mobile Ryzen APUs in a variety of laptop form factors, ranging from ultraportables to gaming machines in the second half of 2017At the other end of the spectrum is the upcoming Ryzen Threadripper, set to release in the summer",tech
"Lastly, AMD confirmed that the budget Ryzen 3 processors are still planned for later in 2017 The Ryzen 3 is meant to fill in the lower end of the product lineup, and compete with Intels Core i3 chips  much as the Ryzen 5 is meant to compete with Intels Core i5 models, and the Ryzen 7 to compete with Core i7 processors",tech

"Todays Google I/O presentation was as wide-ranging as the companys various ventures into future technology, though the biggest cheers of excitement were inevitably reserved for Android I just got my first taste of Googles next iteration, codenamed Android O, and it looks like its targeting exactly the areas where Googles mobile OS needed improvement",tech
"Battery life, a thing that matters to all users at all times, is getting a nice helping hand from a couple of changes that limit resource consumption by apps running in the background When a background app wants a location update, for instance, Android O will feed it the users last known location instead of activating the GPS or other hardware to collect a fresh location",tech
"Then later in the event, Google shows how its Photos app can be used to make a Mothers Day gift in the form of a physical photo album Again, Mothers Day was on Sunday; why are we still talking about it? Maybe this is all a testament to the power of mom guiltHeres a 1 percenter problem: I have both an Amazon Echo and a Google Home in our apartment, and so I could theoretically use whichever one is better In a lot of ways, I think the Google Home is better: it sounds nicer, it works with my television, and it knows a lot of personal information that I havent bothered to try to make available on Amazons AlexaBut I usually just go with Alexa, because Alexa is way easier to say than OK Google",tech
"Rishi Chandra, VP for Google Home, tells me hes heard that feedback In fact, feedback along those lines is one of the reasons that you can say Hey Google instead of OK Google to activate the Google Home But is Google open to adding another, easier-to-say hot word to its Assistant?Maybe!Heres the story: Google decided not to give its intelligent assistant a name like Siri or Alexa or Cortana or whatever",tech
"All of which makes Google cautious about throwing another hot word into the mix, according to Chandra",tech
"As I wrote earlier today, a cautious approach to how to turn AI into consumer interfaces is kind of Googles new thing, and in that context I dont hate the decision to think through hot words really carefully",tech
"CBS debuted a full trailer for Star Trek: Discovery today, showing off a clip stuffed with plenty of Federation action, spaceships, and a ton of new characters, in a story set a decade before Captain Kirk and Spock ventured out in the EnterpriseThe trailer opens with Michelle Yeoh as Captain Philippa Georgiou and Sonequa Martin-Green as First Officer Michael Burnham walking across a desert planet There, Georgiou tells Burnham that its time for her first command, and we jump to scenes on the bridge of the Discovery Over the course of the next two minutes, the ship engages the Klingons, the new cast blurs by, tensions rise, and the character interactions hint at a number of plot threads involving the Federations current place in the universe This show looks as though it has a far more militant Starfleet than the optimistic-explorer group in the original 1966 show",tech
"CBS first announced Discovery in 2015, and revealed a teaser during last years San Diego Comic-Con The show has since run into considerable problems: while it was supposed to begin airing in January 2017, it was pushed back to May, and delayed again earlier this year Last fall, the show also lost its showrunner, Bryan Fuller, due to his workload, which includes Starzs American Gods",tech

"Goodbye and good riddanceI just spent some time with a small, early demo of the new home screen experience for Android O on TV Even though its not fully working yet  some of the apps dont open, and the Google Assistant isnt running on it  it has a nicer TV UI than the other television devices I use every day",tech
"Those TV devices: Apple TV and Chromecast The latter, while convenient, has no on-screen UI at all, which is a problem if youre trying to pick a show with somebody else",tech
"Thats not all that far off from what Apple is trying to do with its TV app, but on Android TV its built right into the home screen That may sound like Android has figured out a way to do what Apple couldnt  but the whole story is obviously more complicatedComplication number one: app makers can choose whether or not to participate in the Watch Now section of Android TV, just like they can choose whether or not to participate in Apples Siri search and its TV app Content companies have proven to be remarkably reticent to allow their content to be listed in places other than their appThe only way to really get those apps into something like the Watch Now queue is probably leverage: sell millions upon millions of devices and prove that the feature is so popular that youd be crazy to lock your content out of it",tech
"So Android O on TVs: looks good, fairly promising, but probably not enough to make you want to switch to it Turns out its easier to make a demo of a better TV interface than it is to actually make it a real thing customers use It should be available alongside Android O for phones later this yearA lot of people turn to search engines when theyre looking for work, so today the worlds biggest search engine announced Google for Jobs The project aims to leverage Googles advanced machine learning capabilities, sorting through millions of job listings to better match opportunities with candidates",tech

"Much of that damage has only become visible in recent days, as a ransomware program dubbed WannaCry locked up computers from the UKs National Health Service to the Russian Ministry of the Interior Some of the damage caused by EternalBlue was harder to spot, caused by more discreet malware designed to infect and monetize computers without leaving a trace As researchers look for clues as to WannaCrys origins, more of those programs are coming to light, and giving us more information about the sheer scale of the damage caused by Eternal Blue",tech
"One of those programs, called Adylkuzz, exploits the vulnerability to mine an obscure cryptocurrency called Monero According to research released this week by Proofpoint, Adylkuzz became active sometime between April 24th and May 2nd, weeks before WannaCry burst onto the scene Researchers estimate it reached hundreds of thousands of devices, spreading through the same Windows vulnerability exploited by WannaCry",tech
"Adylkuzz didnt cause the same stir because it wasnt shutting down computers or sending ransom notes  all the program did was perform Moneros mining operation in the background While thats definitely not good for your computer, its not catastrophic enough to raise alarms, allowing the program to remain undetected until the WannaCry fiasco drew more attention",tech
"That combination of new and old variants make it harder to definitively say who was responsible for the initial WannaCry infections, as it grows increasingly likely that multiple actors are in play The question has become particularly urgent after Symantec and Kaspersky announced evidence tying the initial attack to a previously researched North Korean cybercrime group",tech
"The good news: patching the single vulnerability will protect against all the different variants, particularly now that Microsoft has released its emergency XP patch As a result, some researchers see WannaCrys sudden fame as a powerful weapon against the lesser-known bugs I think that WannaCry caused a few cybercriminals to accelerate their timelines, said Trend Micro cloud research VP Mark Ninnukhoven WannaCry burned the match for EternalBlue For defenders this is a really good thing as WannaCry  which did cause some real-world damage and has frustrated organizations worldwide  wasnt nearly as malicious as other malware and ransomware that weve seen previously",tech
"Google just concluded its I/O 2017 keynote, where executives led by CEO Sundar Pichai laid out the companys future roadmap for Android, Google Assistant, Google Home, virtual reality, and much more",tech
"Skydiving Google Glass-wearers, giant phone giveaways, and major hardware announcements no longer rule Googles biggest annual conference Instead, the company has settled into a pattern of releasing information about what its doing (and what it wants to do) for developers at I/O, instead of trying to wow consumers or the press",tech
"You might call that boring, but thats also a misguided notion, because there was much to glean from Pichai and the rest of the Googlers who presented onstage So here are the 10 most important takeaways from todays I/O keynoteAndroids mobile dominance hasnt stopped growing",tech
"Assistant is expanding beyond Android to iOS Google Assistant will be a standalone app on iPhone and iPad, offering many of the same functions as what weve seen it do on Googles own operating system",tech
"Googles smart speaker was already one of the best ones on the market, but the company announced a suite of other new features and updates beyond calling to Home that make it much more powerful Home is now going to be able to control HBO Now, Hulu, SoundCloud, Deezer, and more Even better, Google is opening up access to Homes Bluetooth radio, meaning you can treat it just like any other Bluetooth speaker",tech
Home is also becoming more useful away from the device itself,tech
Google Photos is getting a slew of great additions The app will now recommend that you share photos youve taken with people that it recognizes as being in the shot,tech
"Digital backups are great, but what if you want physical memories? Google now offers printed photo books Books can be created directly on your smartphone Google will even recommend books to you when it thinks a particular collection makes sense",tech
"And in the future, Google said that Photos will be able to automatically remove unwanted items in your shots  like so:Googles VR ambitions are expanding beyond Daydreams current form, which involves strapping your smartphone to your face The company announced that upcoming headsets from partners including HTC and Lenovo wont require a smartphone or PC to power the users VR experience You just put it on and it works The headsets track virtual space with something Google calls WorldSense, powered by technology from its Tango augmented reality system Unfortunately, we didnt hear exactly when this standalone vision will become reality",tech
"New #Daydream standalone headsets from partners like @htcvive won't require a phone or PC #io17 pictwittercom/7TpYPJGEdUGoogle is launching its preview program for Android O, and the first beta is being released today Were still in the pretty early days of Android Os development, so you shouldnt install this preview on your everyday smartphone",tech
"Pichai was quick to hammer home the point that his companys future depends on artificial intelligence, specifically the machine learning techniques that let algorithms learn on their own and improve over time This technology underpins everything from its Assistant and search to Google Photos and the AlphaGo system",tech
"Google said today that were going to start seeing appliances show up with support for the Google Assistant, and two companies are already launching integrations: LG and GEBoth companies are updating their existing lines of connected appliances so that they can be controlled through the Google Home and Assistant Supported appliances including fridges, ovens, washers and dryers, an air purifier from LG, and an air conditioner and water heater from GEThis doesnt mean youll be able to speak directly to these appliances to control them, however Youll still have to use one of the existing Google Assistant interfaces  your phone or a Google Home  but theyll be able to handle commands that you had to open up LGs or GEs app to handle in the past",tech
"That said, the experience sounds slightly awkward, since youll have to be very specific in your requests to the Google Assistant With GE, for instance, youll have to say OK Google, ask Geneva Home if the dishes are clean, since Geneva Home is the name of its connected app Itd be simpler if you could just ask, Are the dishes clean? How many dishwashers could you possibly be trying to check, anyway?LG says itll begin rolling out support for the Assistant this month GE says its support will launch todayWhile this is an important get for Google, it isnt breaking new ground here",tech
"During a presentation at the I/O conference today, Google said that well start to see Google Assistant Built In badges on supported products A slide in the presentation said well start to see support from Sony, Panasonic, Onkyo, and other familiar appliance brands:Google announced a few big updates for the Google Home today",tech
"Google calls this feature proactive assistance Essentially, Google Home will do its best to alert owners to things they need to know, like reminders, traffic alerts, or flight delaysAt launch, these are going to be really basic  it sounds like the Home wont support notifications for much more than that The limitation may be to prevent people from getting overloaded right away and give up on notifications altogetherGoogle is keeping notifications pretty subtle, too",tech
"Because Home does voice recognition, itll be able to figure out which persons contact list to use when looking up who to callUnfortunately, it sounds like this feature is only coming to the US and Canada for now, so everyone else will have to wait on this one",tech
"You can finally set reminders and calendar entries FinallyGoogle Home has already been able to control a handful of music and video services, but its about to get a bunch of major missing names",tech
"Altogether, these new integrations should make the speaker much more useful as a central media controller While it can already do select services, you cant really rely on the Home right now if you use a variety of streaming apps Increasingly, it looks like youll just be able to ask the Home to do something and know itll work",tech
"Sometimes you actually want to see whats going on, so Googles making a TV interface for the Google Home Youll soon be able to ask the Home to send information to your TV, from basics like the weather and your calendar, to information its looking up like nearby restaurants or YouTube videos you might want to watch",tech
"Google also says that ""over time its going to bring the Assistant integrations that third parties build to the TV",tech
"The Home is going to expand to five new countries this summer: Canada, Australia, France, Germany, and JapanFacebook today announced a series of News Feed tweaks to further decrease the reach and prevalence of clickbait on its social network This comes after a substantial News Feed update last year that restricted the spread of clickbait and punished publishers who primarily use the tactic to trick users into tapping on a link",tech
"Facebook says its new effort is an improved one because it looks at clickbait-detecting signals separately instead of trying to determine if a post or page is guilty of a number of joint factors It does this similarly to how email spam filters, by identifying hundreds of thousands of examples of this manually by having a human team consider if the headline exaggerates the details of a story, and separately if the headline withholds informationIt then automates this process across the entire social network by looking for commonly used phrases that match the clickbait criteria",tech
"If you have a rooted Android device, be aware that you may no longer be able to use the Netflix app going forward The streaming company confirmed that its latest app update will block devices that are not Google-certified or have been altered from accessing the mobile serviceWhile Netflix did not specify why exactly it decided to stop playing nice with rooted devices, the fact that Version 5 of the Netflix app leans on Googles Widevine digital rights management solution suggests some obvious reasons",tech
"Though Netflixs actions may seem well-intentioned, it does negatively impact users whove rooted their devices simply for greater control and customization of their phones rather than to bypass security measures To see if your device is affected, check the Netflix app on the Google Play Store, and youll see whether the app is still compatible",tech
"In an effort to speed up bag drops for priority customers, Delta Air Lines will be testing facial recognition technology at Minneapolis-St",tech
"CBP began testing facial recognition systems at Dulles Airport in 2015, then expanded the tests to New Yorks JFK Airport last year Face-reading check-in kiosks will be appearing at Ottawa International Airport this spring, and British Airways is rolling out a similar system at Londons Heathrow Airport, comparing faces captured at security screenings with a separate capture at the boarding gateBut while those face-scanning initiatives are being used for security purposes, airlines like Delta also see a customer service opportunity as well",tech
"Delta says its only interest is speeding up the check-in process for customers, while also freeing up gate agents to deal with more important situations We expect this investment and new process to save customers time, said Gareth Joyce, Deltas senior VP for airport customer service and cargo, in a statement And, since customers can operate the biometric-based bag drop machine independently, we see a future where Delta agents will be freed up to seek out travelers and deliver more proactive and thoughtful customer service",tech

"Kennicott is a student in Ramsays MasterClass, an online course made up of 20 videos, each under 10 minutes long",tech
"Rogier told The Verge that among MasterClass paying students are both accomplished professionals and Oscar winners, as well as amateurs and hobbyists In each videos comments section, users can talk to their fellow classmates, although theres no way to tell who else is online at the same time as you Its like any other comments section in that it can look like a stream of people just chatting into the void",tech
"But no matter where the students are watching from, or what bio they write to describe themselves, everyone ends up taking the same exact classes, down to an instructors weighty pauses As with most startups, MasterClass seems to be prioritizing reach over personalization, which can lead to disappointment for users who go in expecting one kind of class, only to find out after the moneys been paid that its another thing entirely In that case, theres always the 30-day refundSherry Strong, an author and clean-eating advocate, took Steve Martins MasterClass with the hope of infusing some levity into her work Shes giving a keynote presentation about sugar addiction soon, and she hopes that comedy will encourage people to let their guard down during the post-keynote discussion",tech
"So if you need to figure out how to break apart an entire chicken, head to YouTube But maybe MasterClass gives users $100 worth of inspiration, if not tangible skills Clark Coffey, an independent filmmaker and actor who took Werner Herzogs class, said the experience wasnt really about how to make a movie, but rather why you should make one",tech
"Herzog, whose tutorials have titles like Financing First Films, Negotiation Skills, and Working with Actors on Set do give some practical advice",tech
"On The Hub, students frequently post drafts of their work, asking for candid feedback Unlike a more public platform like Reddit, the comments on The Hub are largely thoughtful and generous  theres just not a lot of them In a post from about two weeks ago, a student asks for general feedback on an experimental short film Only one person responded to his call, clearly trying to nail the grad-seminar balance of criticism and praiseDespite the fact that The Hub has been available since launch, Coffey said the most helpful discussions have occurred off-platform  when students move their conversations over to Facebook",tech
"Rogier refused to offer even a ballpark figure of how many users MasterClass has, but its clear that the company is trying to expand quickly Rogier told me he wants to double the number of classes offered in the next year, and expand the amount of tutorials from existing instructorsIncreasing the number of instructors makes sense, because for all of the students I spoke with, the celebrity instructors were MasterClass biggest appeal by far (Coffey is a lifelong Herzog fan; Kennicott found out about Ramsays class because he follows him on Facebook) MasterClass makes it pretty easy for the celebrities, too, who are compensated an undisclosed sum for their effort",tech
"Theres another MasterClass selling point, one that Rogier only mentions to me at the end of our chat, and its a little bit dark We were talking about the possibility of having Prince as a guitar teacher, and Rogier remarked that with Princes death last year came the death of his craft Not guitar-playing in general, but how Prince specifically played guitar If [musicians] do interviews, its about their music, new albums, Rogier said This is about making sure their craft isnt lost",tech
"MasterClass becomes a bolder and slightly more eerie startup if you think of it as meticulously documenting the artistry of the worlds biggest celebrities  as described by the celebrities themselves  so that it can serve as a digital time capsule after their deaths If thats the case, MasterClass still has a number of celebrities to collect, but ego and fear of death has always been a great persuasive deviceHappily, all of the current MasterClass teachers are still alive and working, and the students that I spoke to were all able to name at least one benefit of taking a class",tech

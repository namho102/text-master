"Its a passion at odds with Gunns humble demeanour: one that forms the foundation of 132 ODI, 95 T20I and 11 Test caps",sport
"Yet Lane also marked Gunn as his luxury player: a bowler of yorkers, a batter with a breezy cameo in the chamber and a gifted fielder",sport
"At the end of her England debut in 2004, in South Africa, Gunn was called into the umpires office You chuck it, said one of the officials",sport
"When Gunn became the first woman accepted into the Nottinghamshire academy (she now plays for Warwickshire) most of her time off the field was spent as a lab rat To correct a quirk where her right arm comes out before coming past her ear  rather than the conventional wheel-like motion of most bowlers  she was ordered by coaches to run through the academy corridors and simulate bowling while pressed up against the wall This, they believe, would stop her arm from moving out",sport
Englands women have taken over as the worlds top-ranked team following a convincing and fully deserved triumph over the Black Ferns,sport
"Given the opportunity to attack from long range, however, the Black Ferns are frequently as deadly as their male counterparts A gloriously skilful chip and chase score from their talented scrum-half Kendra Cocksedge levelled the scores before the pacy Portia Woodman intercepted an attempted pass from Scarratt to outsprint the retreating cover from 60 metresRemarkably, New Zealand could not score any further points until the 78th minute of the game as England took increasing control, thanks partly to their shrewd kicking game Abbie Scott was duly credited with the first of Englands close-range tries but, with the scores level at 14-14 at half-time, it was a contest still awaiting a decisive interventionA key moment arrived within three minutes of the restart when a well-worked lineout move resulted in Katy McLean putting Lydia Thompson over in the right corner",sport
"Hunters own performance drew particular praise from Englands head coach, Simon Middleton, whose side have also defeated Australia and Canada in this months international series as they prepare to defend their World Cup title Shes a fantastic captain and a fantastic player, said Middleton Thats why shes world player of the year",sport

"Israel Folaus second tryscoring double in as many weeks couldnt save the Wallabies, as Scotland confirmed their status as world rugbys big improvers Up to fifth in the rankings, the Scots cashed in on a disjointed display from Michael Cheikas men",sport
"As playmaker Bernard Foley admitted, the Wallabies were their own worst enemies during a dreadful first half They trailed 17-12 at the break, gifting the Scots all of their points through an early penalty goal, then an intercept try to centre Duncan Taylor and a charge-down effort from goalkicking five-eighth Finn RussellOnly Folaus two strikes kept the Wallabies in the contest",sport
"But despite being a man down with No8 Ryan Wilson yellow-carded a minute before half-time, the Scots refused to yield until Australia briefly snatched the lead in the 57th minute",sport
"But, a 50-metre try three minutes later to flanker Hamish Watson restored the visitors five-point lead and, despite several opportunities, the Wallabies were unable to find a reply to give Foley another chance to break Scottish heartsLast-gasp penalty goals from Foley had denied the Scots at the 2015 Rugby World Cup at Twickenham and again on the Wallabies spring tour last November",sport
"After a moment of magic against South Africa from Zach Mercer, the captain, booked England Under-20s place in Sundays Junior World Cup final in Tbilisi, comparisons with their football counterparts were inevitable  they were not, however, wholly accurate Englands football team winning any form of World Cup understandably commands attention but this is a fifth final in a row for a side who set out without five players away with Eddie Joness senior side in Argentina",sport
"Oval ball success is sustained by England at this level and, while a rampant New Zealand stand between them and a fourth title in five years, the number of absentees makes their achievement of reaching the final in Georgia all the more impressive Mercers omission by Jones for the Argentina tour was surprising but the Australian still took with him Tom and Ben Curry, Nick Isiekwe, Joe Cokanasiga and Jack Maunder England have also suffered six injuries to their backs during the tournament in Georgia while Will Evans and Jamie Shillcock were ruled out before it started",sport
"Its that context that makes the achievement of this group such a significant one, says Dean Ryan, who took up the role of the Rugby Football Unions head of international player development last July Its that backdrop that makes it so significant Under-20 World Cups are normally framed around three or four key individuals, not a collective, but the collective of this group has been a huge success",sport
"Watching Tom Curry last week was tremendous for us and the team here To watch him win his first cap, to watch Nick Isiekwe come on and win a lineout, Jack Maunder fire it along for [Denny] Solomona to score [the winning try]  thats fantastic for these lads because they can think: Thats how close we are",sport

"On these very pages, in the days before that 2004 series, the late Mike Marqusee had written: Cricket, like other mass spectator sports, is a magnet for meanings, a malleable metaphor And in the past, cricket between India and Pakistan has served as both a symbol of south Asian harmony and a prime example of what George Orwell called war minus the shootingThe key words here are the past",sport
"The current generation of cricketers has not played each other often enough to become steeped in the rivalry, or to form the sort of friendships that existed at a time when cricket showed the wayThis decade, India and Pakistan have contested just 10 ODIs (India lead 7-3) and six Twenty20 internationals  the majority of them in multi-nation tournaments such as the World Cup and Champions Trophy",sport

"The 17-point loss, on the night they honoured club legend Brent Harvey pre-game, left the Kangaroos languishing with a 4-8 record and a percentage well under 100But they also remain just two games outside the top eight, in a year when upset results are rifeIts a strange season ",sport

"One positive was second-gamer Declan Mountford, who put everything into his tag on Saints star Jack Steven and kept him quiet for much of the first halfWhile Steven went forward late in the second term and kicked two goals, Mountford earned a big tick from Scott for his performanceScott was also pleased for ruckman Todd Goldstein, who was high among Norths best after a run of below-par formDespite failing to finish the Kangaroos off in the final term on Friday, St Kilda coach Alan Richardson was rapt with the performanceThey led by 42 points midway through the last quarter, but took the foot off Norths throat",sport

"The investigative skills of Quincy are hardly necessary when determining why McIlroy missed a second US Open cut in succession This tournament has not been altogether kind to McIlroy aside from the 2011 occasion when he won it, let alone when the buildup was disrupted by fitness troubles The rib problem that upset his opening to the year provides perfect explanation for the appearance of rust at Erin Hills",sport
Here is another reason for McIlroy cheer; no other player among the worlds leading group has recently embarked on a profitable run The 28-year-old is hardly lagging behind in a wider contextThe next part of the season is key for him,sport

"The card game bridge is hardly the most physically strenuous of activities But according to a judgment by one of the European court of justices most senior lawyers, the game should be considered a sport  for tax purposes at least",sport
"The recommendation is the latest salvo in a longrunning legal case brought by the English Bridge Union (EBU), which argues that entry fees for its tournaments should be exempt from VAT, as is the case with all activities classed as sportThe EBU lost its initial claim against HM Revenue and Customs, which says sports should have a significant element of physical activity But the EBU appealed to the upper tax tribunal, which referred the case to European judgesThe player-funded organisation maintains that preferential tax treatment for sport was intended to benefit activities that provide either physical or mental health benefits to regular participants It argues that bridge  a game played by four players in two competing partnerships  helps stimulate the mind, particularly in older people",sport
"On Thursday the advocate general Maciej Szpunar argued that sport should be understood as something that involved the training of mental or physical fitness in a way that is generally beneficial to the health and wellbeing of citizens, and recommended that bridge be exempted from VAT in the UKHe also noted that the International Olympic Committee was among organisations that expressly include mental sports or endorse activities without a physical element, having classified bridge as a sport in 1998The case will be reviewed by ECJ judgesin the autumn",sport
"This will have huge benefits as it will allow us to invest further in the game, and make entries to EBU competitions cheaper, thus allowing more people to enjoy playing bridge, and enabling more to experience the social and mental benefits that playing bridge offers, the EBU said in a statementJeremy Dhondy, the EBUs chairman, said the finding was a vindication of our view that bridge should be regarded as a sport with all the advantages that brings both for bridge as a game and also for our members and prospective membersWe want our game to play its full part as an activity to promote social inclusion and welcome the judgment of the European court, he added",sport
"Different countries have different opinions on whether bridge is a sport In Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France and it is classed as a sport for tax purposes, but in Ireland and Sweden it is notThe 2011 Charities Act adopted a definition of sport as activities which promote health involving physical or mental health or exertion, which specifically included mind sports",sport

There are a lot of sports writers and fans who are adamant that its impossible to compare sporting teams across seasons and eras,sport
"This notion of continuously rating individuals or teams using results adjusted for opposition quality has a long history One version of the method can be traced back to Arpad Elo, who came up with it as a way of rating chess players as they defeated, drew or lost to other players of sometimes widely differing abilities Its still used for that purpose todayIn sports like football, Elo-style rating systems can be expanded to provide not just a single rating for a team, but a separate rating for its offensive and defensive abilities; the former is based on the teams record of scoring points relative to the quality of the defences it has faced, and the latter on its record of preventing points being scored relative to the quality of the offences it has facedIf we do this for the AFL we can quantify the offensive and defensive abilities of teams within and across seasons using a common currency: points",sport
"There are many ways to do this, and a number of websites offer their own versions, but the methodology well use here has the following key characteristics:Applying this methodology generates the data in the chart below, which records the offensive and defensive ratings of every team from seasons 2000 to 2016 as at the end of their respective home-and-away seasons",sport
"The level of association between teams offensive and defensive ratings can be measured using something called a correlation coefficient, which takes on values between -1 and +1 Negative values imply a negative association  say if strong offensive teams tended to be weak defensively and vice versa  while positive values imply a positive association, such as we see in the chartFrom the correlation coefficients for team ratings in the current and previous eras we see the degree of association between team offensive and defensive ratings has been at historically high levels in the modern era",sport
Port Adelaide ended their 2007 home-and-away season more positively but probably not as well as a team second on the ladder might have been expected to  an assessment that seems all the more reasonable given the grand final result just a few weeks later,sport
To look at that issue we use the ratings in a slightly different way,sport
"The percentages that are most interesting are those in the column furthest on the left in each block They tell how successful teams that have found themselves stronger defensively but weaker offensively than their opponents have beenWhat we find is that, in every era since the second world war:We should note though that none of the percentages are statistically significantly different from 50%, so we cant definitively claim that, in any particular era, defensive superiority has been preferable to offensive superiority in the home-and-away season or that the opposite has been true in finals",sport
"So, where do the current crop of teams sit? The chart below maps each of the 18 current teams ratings as at the end of round 12 and the ratings of all 34 grand finalists from the period 2000-2016 as at the end of round 12 in their respective yearsAdelaide stand alone offensively, with a rating almost as good as the 2000 Essendon team who were 12-0 after round 12 having averaged just over 136 points per game in a season where the all-team average score was 103 points per team per game across the entire home-and-away season The Dons scored then at a rate just over 30% higher than an average team",sport
"This year, Adelaide are averaging just under 119 points per game in a season where the all-team average is just under 91 points per game, which is also about 30% higher They are, clearly, a formidable team offensively, though theyve yet to impress consistently defensively",sport
"The 2017 Port Adelaide and GWS teams come next, both located just outside the crop of highest-rated grand finalists, and having combined ratings a little below Adelaides This weeks loss to Essendon had a (quite reasonably) significant effect on Ports rating, as did GWSs loss to Carlton",sport
"Geelong, Collingwood, Sydney, Richmond and the Western Bulldogs are a little more south-east of that prime flag-winner territory, and would require a few above-expectation performances in upcoming weeks to enter that area The Bulldogs in particular would need to show a little more offensive ability to push into the group, though they had a similar rating at the same point last season, so whos to say they need to do anything much moreCollingwoods relatively high rating might raise a few eyebrows, but they have, it should be noted, generated more scoring shots in their losses to the Western Bulldogs in round one and Essendon in round five, and generated only four or fewer less scoring shots in their losses to Richmond in round two, St Kilda in round four, Carlton in round seven, GWS in round eight, and Melbourne in round 12 Theyre currently ranked seventh on combined ratingEssendon, Melbourne and St Kilda form the next sub-group  rated slightly above average on combined rating but below almost all previous grand finalists at the equivalent point in the season",sport
No other team has a combined rating that is positive or that exceeds that of any flag winner at this point in the season since 2000,sport
"Still, theres a lot that can happen between now and the end of the season, as we can see in this final chart, which shows 2017 team ratings and the ratings of all non-grand finalists from the seasons from 2000 to 2016There are plenty of sides in the chart that rated highly at the end of round 12 that never got as far as grand final dayFor example, the Geelong 2010 team was 10-2 after 12 rounds, one game clear at the head of the competition ladder with a 156 percentage That team went 7-3 over the remainder of the home-and-away season to finish runners-up in the minor premiership before being eliminated by the minor premiers, Collingwood, 120-79 in a preliminary finalAnd, in any case, in a year where results have constantly surprised and where two wins currently separates fith from 17th on the ladder, no team can reasonably feel assured of progressing into September, let alone to the MCG at the end of that month",sport
Even the best-laid plans can be instantly scuppered and the British & Irish Lions are suddenly on red alert over the fitness of Owen Farrell A thigh strain sustained in training has ruled the fly-half out of the match-day squad to face the Maori All Blacks on Saturday and time is not on his side before the first Test against the All Blacks one week later,sport
"Farrell is reported to have a grade one quadricep tear, which is at the lesser end of the scale but the last thing the Lions need is a kicker and playmaker with a bad leg",sport
"As yet there is no official indication when Farrell may be fit again, with Dan Biggar coming on to Saturdays bench, but even more pressure now rests on Jonathan Sexton, whose best chance of starting the Tests at No10 had previously rested on Farrell playing at 12 Barring a swift recovery for the Saracen, this weekends midfield combination of Sexton, Ben Teo and Jonathan Davies are on standby to feature against New Zealand as wellGatland, one suspects, was planning on Farrell, Teo and Davies forming a 10-12-13 partnership in Auckland and hoping a late rush of form from Warburton would secure him a place ahead of OMahony or Sean OBrien The two Irishmen and Taulupe Faletau were so impressive as a back-row combination, however, in last Saturdays win over the Crusaders that Warburton may find the first Test arriving a few days too soonGatland, by his own admission, is currently tempted to leave the trio intact",sport
Little room for misinterpretation there,sport
"In almost the same breath, even so, the head coach left the door ajar for a second-half renewal of the 10-12 axis that went well in Christchurch after Davies departed early with a head knock That combination was pretty seamless, agreed Gatland, emphasising the need to have different variations up his sleeve",sport
"Gatlands opposite number, Steve Hansen, will certainly expect to see most of this side trotting out at Eden Park",sport
"Rhys Webb and Dan Cole, assuming full fitness, must also be contenders to replace Greig Laidlaw and Kyle Sinckler on the bench, although the latter is proving one of this squads most engaging, enthusiastic members If Ken Owens and Jack McGrath are to leapfrog Jamie George and Mako Vunipola respectively, meanwhile, they are going to have to buck the evidence of this tour so far",sport

"Hence the reason the penultimate midweek game against the Highlanderson Tuesday, before the first Test on Saturday week, carries more significance than might seem obvious at first glance The Lions badly want to maintain the momentum generated by their victory against the Crusaders and numerous examples exist of spirited dirt-trackers playing key roles in successful tours",sport

"In the twilight of Saturday, two days after re-signing forward Josh Schache, the hitherto unloved Brisbane Lions played like a club set free from heavy chains  although Dayne Zorko has hardly been bound this year, metaphorically or otherwise Through 12 weeks, the Brisbane best-and-fairest winner is the only player not named Dusty or Dangerfield to have averaged more than 25 possessions, five clearances and a goal a game",sport
"In the traditional football states, the 5ft 9in Zorko is like one of those slightly distorted airport announcements you dont quite catch but suspect might be important There is no doubting his importance to Brisbane, just as there is no doubt that to break through for a thumping 57-point win after a run of nine losses matters to a young group like the LionsAt some point in time you need to get some emotional nourishment for the group and we were able to get that tonight, said Brisbane coach Chris Fagan",sport
"One club that knows a little about brand is Essendon, and on Saturday they went some way to re-establishing their on-field reputation with a dominating performance against Port Adelaide that only the most partisan Bomber fans would have seen coming  and even most of them would not have anticipated what they saw from Cale HookerHooker won Essendons best-and-fairest as a defender in 2015, but has been a point of fan frustration and online forum contention this year due to John Worsfolds persistence in playing him forward It cant have been much fun for Hooker going from the key man down back to being the support act up forward, but after five first-half goals, there was no doubting who was the star among many at Etihad Stadium on Saturday night",sport
"But there is something of Sisyphus in Essendon Jobe Watson, Zach Merrett and Anthony McDonald-Tipungwuti play in an exciting, daring fashion that delights the football world, and then their fans boo Port Adelaides Paddy Ryder every time he touches the ballHaving initially expressed a desire to remain with the Bombers during the supplements saga, the scrutiny eventually wore Ryder down and he requested a trade at the end of 2014",sport
"That Ryder served a 12-month ban last year along with 33 of his former team-mates shouldve been enough to provide some perspective to those Essendon fans that booed Then again, if a concern raised last week by former Bomber Nathan Lovett-Murray over the health of his daughter (who was conceived after the Bombers 2012 supplement program) was not enough to provide a sympathetic disposition, than the cause is likely a lost oneSympathy and the Carlton Football Club have been strangers for some time, but in the dying light of Sunday afternoon, even neutral football fans were willing them to a win against Greater Western Sydney",sport
"In most sports there exists a proxy war between proponents of the high-octane offence practiced by the Giants and traditionalists who insist that such systems inevitably falter to a superior defence The traditionalist line of thinking isnt as easily marketable for a club in the early days of a rebuild, but just because its not an easy sell doesnt mean that its not worth buying  and the Blues players and supporters have bought in",sport
"The primordial game style from which the Carlton reinvention is evolving is built around a defensive structure (of which former Giants, Lachie Plowman and Caleb Marchbank are important pieces) that could one day see Brendon Bolton receive Queens Birthday honours for his work as footballs foremost civil engineer Although it must be said that Carltons defensive structure is built on one of the games most fundamental of principles  the spare manOn Sunday, the Giants midfielders won almost twice as many clearances and blew Carltons doors off for inside 50s",sport

"The independent report is expected to make uncomfortable reading for the governing body, British Cycling, discovering over the course of more than 90 separate interviews that many riders and staff felt bullied and discriminated against But it is also expected to criticise the funding agency UK Sport for failing to demand accountability, missing opportunities to identify management shortcomings at British Cycling years earlier and to spare much heartache",sport
"It is not just cycling and canoeing, two of Britains best funded Olympic sports  in receipt of more than 50m between them over the last four-year cycle  conducting internal investigations British Swimming is looking into claims of bullying made by Paralympic athletes",sport

There have been higher-quality games of cricket in this tournament but none yet with such a taut finish Beyond the dropped catches (there were plenty of those) and the overthrows and the wanton strokes there was at the end of Cardiffs sunniest day so far the wonderful tension that knock-out cricket can generate,sport
"At the end of it all Pakistan scraped to a victory that should have been so much more straightforward They won by three wickets but they needed an eighth-wicket partnership of 75 between their captain, Sarfraz Ahmed, and Mohammad Amir to get them over the line Sarfraz produced a captains innings of 61 not out but he was badly dropped on 38 and less culpably on 40 as Sri Lanka faltered in the field in the closing overs",sport
This victory means that England will meet Pakistan in Cardiff in the first semifinal on Wednesday They may be happy about that for the surface here seems to suit some of their team (their bowlers if not their batsmen)There has not been much encouragement for bowlers in this tournament but the likelihood of some lateral movement for the fast men has been greater in Wales than in England,sport
"Pakistan, especially with the introduction of Junaid Khan as a replacement for the volatile Wahab Riaz alongside Amir and Hasan Ali, now have a triumvirate of pace bowlers who seem adept at exploiting any help Hence they may be more dangerous opponents for England than Sri Lanka might have beenTheir pace trio were effective on Monday",sport
"Mathews, maybe surprised by extra pace from Amir, was bowled off the inside edge; Dhananjaya de Silva nicked a beauty from Junaid, a fierce introduction to the tournament for a man who has only just been called up as a replacement for Kusal Perera Next Dickwella was brilliantly caught by Sarfraz from an inside edge; the Pakistan captain was swamped by his colleagues in their excitement and in their recognition that this was an extraordinary one-handed take Thisara Perera soon followed as the heart was ripped out of the Sri Lankan innings",sport
The Sri Lankan attack does not possess the same potency but theirs is a team of granite resolve When Pakistan were 74 without loss in the 12th over the game seemed over,sport

"A career-best four for 33 against Australia on Saturday included the wickets of David Warner and Steve Smith, with two thirds of his deliveries dot balls, and was reward for a bowler who has battled back from a chronic ankle injury and whose pace and trajectory provides a point of difference in Morgans right-arm seam attackIts a nice feeling to have the confidence of the captain, said Wood, who set up the group-winning performance against New Zealand with the wicket of their key man Kane Williamson Subconsciously I dont know if it makes me try a little bit harder, but at the moment I seem to be getting some of the best players out",sport

"For while Gatland and his coaches have sporadically hinted that the Lions are holding aspects of their attacking game-plan back for the Tests, it is a stretch to suggest that is why the maul, in a try-scoring sense, has not been used to any great effect as yet More likely, as with their inability to finish when Watson burst through against the Crusaders, or when all Jonathan Davies needed to do was find George North outside him, it requires polish and as frustrating as those missed opportunities were last Saturday, perhaps the most disappointing chance to go begging was the late lineout against the BluesThe Lions face the Highlanders on Tuesday under the Forsyth Barr Stadium roof and so it will be the hardest, fastest pitch that they encounter throughout the tour, against a side who will be hell-bent on breaking the shackles imposed on the Crusaders",sport

"A case in point relates to Griffiths, whom Strachan showed a real reluctance to play until recently The manager will claim it was a simple mistake but pointing towards Christophe Berra as a player at a Hearts team who finished sixth in Scotland was disingenuous; they did not, just as the centre-back was virtually an everpresent player last season for Ipswich Town in the Championship, a division from which Strachan has always drawn heavily",sport

"Sitting in third place and trailing Serbia and the Republic of Ireland by four points after a fifth successive draw, Coleman admitted that Wales now have no margin for error in the rest of the campaign if they want to top the group I think realistically, if we want to finish first, [we need] four wins, the Wales manager said",sport

"It was an audacious piece of skill and came after a comedy of errors from Serbias point of view Vladimir Stojkovic, the Serbia goalkeeper, made a pigs ear of dealing with Ben Daviess long ball and ended up bringing down Ramsey just outside the area when he realised that he was unable to shepherd the ball out of play",sport

"How quickly the tone of conversation has changed The next few months for France were supposed to be about fine-tuning, about evolving, about Deschamps prising himself away from his loyalty to tried and trusted players to unleash the prodigies in their place There is such demand to see the new wave fast tracked into the first XI The seemingly unstoppable trajectory of Mbapp, the silky touches of Thomas Lemar and the darting dribbles of Ousmane Dembl make strong cases to be the present rather than the future They already look revved up and ready to go and Deschamps is under pressure to weigh up how he balances what they offer compared to an older generation that he trusts",sport
"In Sweden, for a game Deschamps (rightly) assumed might pose physical and tactical challenges, the France manager was reluctant to be too bold Having already integrated exciting full-backs in the Monaco pair Benjamin Mendy and Djibril Sidib, Deschamps chose more conservatively in attacking positions, mindful that the young whizzes further forward might not track back or be as diligent as a more experienced option",sport
"How long is the life of a team? The question was posed by a French journalist, Vincent Duluc, in the aftermath of the quirky defeat in Sweden Deschamps is not about to abandon the Euro 2016 team, which has formed the basis of this qualification campaign",sport
A school of thought insists that it is unhealthy to crank up the hype trains lever so it approaches speeds worthy of a Shinkansen But  but Christian Pulisic,sport
"Of the two outfield regulars with the biggest reputations, though only 29, Michael Bradley appears to be settling into a role where he is more shield than sword, disrupting the opposition rather than defining the flow of his own sides attacks Substituted after 61 minutes on Thursday, Clint Dempsey subjected his coach, Bruce Arena, to that famous Deuce glare, eyes boring into his targets soul like an electric drill bitThat surely reflected natural frustration at missing an ideal opportunity to grab the goal that would bring him level with Landon Donovan at the top of the USs all-time scoring chart",sport
"Pulisic scored his second goal of the game a minute after Dempsey trudged off And like the former Premier League man in his prime, it was a move that showed him to be both an exuberant creator and a clinical finisherForced to pick between the two, its not a hard choice Given that both tend to roam all over the final third, making Jozy Altidores selection important because his more static style provides a fulcrum for attacks, Arena may well have to make a decision The US have only ever won once in Mexico, a 1-0 friendly victory in 2012",sport
"Arena said on Thursday that he intends to make changes for Sundays match In the high altitude of Mexico City, on short rest, it would appear logical to put the 34-year-old on the bench and go with the hotter feet of the Borussia Dortmund player, who has seven goals in 15 international appearances, five of them coming in eight World Cup qualifiersHes ahead of his time - he gets the ball hes super comfortable on it, hes never ever panicking, you see him when he gets inside the box he stands his defender up and the world is his oyster",sport
"Given the forgiving nature of the group, which sees the top three teams automatically reach Russia while the fourth faces a play-off against an Asian side, losing on the road will not be fatal to American prospects as long as they keep winning at homeMexico beat Honduras 3-0 on Thursday while Costa Rica and Panama shared a goalless draw The US win lifted them to third in the standings, six points behind Mexico in first",sport
Mexico have conceded only once in five Hexagonal games,sport
"Pulisic, though, has uncommon self-assurance as well as remarkable talent Theyre a good team and theyre not easy to beat at home so its going to take a lot, but I think the guys we have, the confidence we have, I think theres no reason why we cant do that, he saidEoin Morgan had tipped the raucous Eric Hollies stand here to be one of Englands chief assets before their encounter with Australia",sport
"But upon returning to the middle, Morgan lit the fuse from which the Hollies  and Edgbaston as a whole  would explode He cracked Mitchell Starcs first two deliveries through the covers in fearless fashion and, with it, ramming home the point that his England side are no longer the types to be cowed when faced by a canary-yellow onslaught in one-day international cricket",sport
"Ben Stokess violent, unbeaten 102 will doubtless hog much of the limelight, but Morgans 87 in their breakneck stand of 159 was pivotal to this win He was named in the week by Paul Farbrace, the assistant coach, as the standout central figure in Englands one-day revival and, as he flayed Australias bowlers, it felt simply the latest slab of evidenceMorgan came into the side eight years go as an outlier: a 360-degree cavalier in a team made up largely of roundheads",sport
"With Finch and Australia dispatched, agonising over Roys spot will doubtless fill some of the time between now and Wednesdays semi-final in Cardiff Having averaged 673 in eight one-day innings this summer it is fair to say England have entered the territory where they lose little but face in making the switch to Jonny Bairstows previously glowing batBairstow has history of thriving when parachuted in, and even Roys electric outfielding  demonstrated by the pop-up-and-reclaim boundary catch that removed Glenn Maxwell in front of Edgbastons most famous stand would be more than compensated by the Yorkshiremans equal prowess The one unknown is how he goes against the new white ball at the top level",sport
"While Roys trough has been an unshiftable headache of late, Morgan will be heartened by his bowlers They turned Australias launchpad of 181 for three, at the now double-the-score mark of 32 overs, into 276 for nine from 50, and largely backing up their performance against New Zealand on a pitch offering lessSmith had described Englands bowling strategy as predictable before the match, claiming it to be half the battle won already",sport
"A maiden five-wicket haul is the next box to tick off on the Durham quicks CV, but with the pelts of Hashim Amla, Kane Williamson, David Warner and Smith hanging on his wall already this summer, the curious folk that have stared solely at the statistics and not recognised the potential of Woods attributes are evaporating fast",sport

"The England support drew unfavourable comparisons between their oldest rival in international football and San Marino, suggesting, impolitely, that Scotland were inferior to Europes whipping boys",sport
"Barring a remarkable upturn in fortune in the final four matches, this painful draw may well have curtailed Scotlands World Cup qualifying prospects and Gordon Strachans hopes of leading his country to its first major tournament since 1998 Scotlands staying home, as the England fans cruelly, bluntly but accurately put it As the reaction to the final whistle testified, with Scots on their knees on the pitch and in the stands, it should have been so much better, a turning point in a campaign that has flickered only sporadically Griffithss outstanding free-kick double put Scotland in sight of their first Hampden win over England since 1985, when Strachan was playing, but regardless of their inability to hold out, and lack of attacking options, their performance and commitment should silence the debate over the managers future for some time yetSouthgate raised a few eyebrows by giving Jake Livermore his second start in an England shirt",sport
Strachan sprung a surprise by recalling Christophe Berra to Scotlands back-line for the first time since the 3-0 loss to England in November but also by reverting to a three-man central defence with Kieran Tierney on the left,sport
"One disappointment for the Lions, which will kick in after the euphoria and relief of a win they needed with the majority of the side likely to start the first Test, was that they did not adorn it with tries They created chances but a mixture of poor decision-making, a lack of understanding and slack passing under pressure cost them from the opening minute",sport
"What mattered, though, was the result and the manner of the victory",sport
"They created two half-chances, George Bridge shoved into touch in the first half after a cross kick and then failing to gather Jack Goodhues improvised kick from a scrum, but otherwise the Crusaders were mute as an attacking force They struggled to please the French referee, Mathieu Raynal, at the scrum, penalised for not staying square and engaging too early, but they were more perturbed at what they felt was his connivance at the Lions encroaching beyond the feet of the hindmost player as they rushed up in defence",sport
"With French officials in charge of the final two Tests, the New Zealand head coach, Steve Hansen, is sure to use media conferences to put pressure on Jrme Garcs and Romain Poite, officials who were not swayed by home pressure during the 2015 World Cup when they took charge of Englands group matches against Wales and AustraliaRaynal was in charge when New Zealand lost to Ireland in Chicago in November and, while the Top 14 may have become the most mind-numbing of the major leagues in Europe, French officials are arguably the worlds best, refereeing what they see with consistency",sport

"Major League Soccer needs Miami just as much as Miami wants Major League Soccer Our hope is within the next several weeks the league will accept Miami and the Beckham ownership groupThe crucial development was the approval by Miami-Dade commissioners to sell a three-acre parcel of county-owned land in the Overtown neighbourhood to the Beckham team, which also includes the music and television entrepreneur Simon Fuller, Bolivian telecommunications billionaire Marcelo Claure and, as of April, financier Todd Boehly, co-owner of baseballs Los Angeles DodgersThe group bought the derelict sites other six acres privately for $19m (15m) in March 2016 and Beckham needed the final piece of the jigsaw to secure MLS approval for a 25,000-seat, open-roofed stadium A team of league inspectors visited the site this week",sport
"Yet despite this breakthrough, the MLS product Beckham now looks set to offer is a far cry from the one he envisioned back in February 2014 Then, on a stage beneath the tropical foliage of Miamis Perez arts museum, Beckham confirmed he was exercising the cut-price $25m franchise ownership option that came as a signing bonus when he signed a five-year deal to join LA Galaxy in 2007",sport

"I said, Show me the studies, the traffic studies, the feasibility studies, and they had nothing, she said We want proof of how this is going to affect us",sport
"ODonoghue said she was also concerned that the group planned to use the stadium for open-air concerts as well as 15 or so football games a yearLeiweke sought to allay residents fears: People worry were going to do 20 or 30 nights of concerts and disrupt their sleeping patterns and kids Not true, he said Were going to cap the number of concerts we do and the genre of music We are committed to being a good neighbour, we are committed to being a good partner",sport
"Amanda Hand, whose house directly faces what would be the western side of the stadium, was not persuaded They have a lot of language like we will attempt to, try to and intend to, she said Theres a lot of aspirations and not a lot of guarantees Aspirations are not legally enforceableCelebrity-starved and economically depressed, Overtown is also not quite what the limelight-loving Beckhams had in mind when they set their sights on a life in Miami",sport
"In 2014, at the start of the odyssey, the Miami Heat were the defending NBA champions and it was common to find Beckham in a courtside seat, or chilling with his friend LeBron James, the Heat forward who was once a potential partner in the soccer enterpriseBeckham and wife Victoria, the former Spice Girl, were spotted in Miami more often then, eating with other celebrities at the Zuma restaurant or lounging at Soho Beach House, the exclusive club the footballer still uses as a de facto office",sport
"Times have changed: the Heat are back among basketballs also-rans and James has gone home to Cleveland But there will be plenty to occupy Beckham in Miami as his as-yet unnamed franchise moves forwardA first priority will be finding a big-name coach and well-known players who can deliver immediate success and catch up with Floridas two other new professional soccer teams, which stole a march while Beckhams project floundered",sport
"Orlando City, who joined MLS in 2015, signed Brazilian World Cup winner Kaka; Miami FC, unbeaten in eight games this year in their second season in the junior North American Soccer League, are part-owned by the former Italy captain Paolo Maldini",sport
"Beckham has said it would be disrespectful to speculate about his own potential players, especially because it could be four years before the team plays a game But Peter Wilt, who launched Chicago Fire into MLS in 1998 as the franchises founding general manager, said Beckhams status and connections would attract big names eager to be part of the leagues planned expansion to 24 teams by 2020",sport
"David has an allure that gives them an advantage at the start, he said Its a dissipating advantage as he gets further away from his playing days and celebrity status, but theres still a something there Working with Tim Leiweke, no doubt hell be smart enough and strategic enough to bring in other athletes and coaches who have that allure",sport

"Even so he had the presence of mind to treat the crowd to his greatest hits As the athletes lined up for the 100m, he shadow-boxed like a prizefighter as the master of ceremonies stirred the crowd into greater frenzies by rattling through his achievements with a preachers force and certainty Then, when the gun went off, he even made his customary terrible start, leaving his blocks with all the grace of someone with backache climbing out of his favourite easy chair Yet at 50 metres he was ahead and away  and, as always, simply uncatchableHis time of 10",sport

"An injury to fly-half Joey Carbery, who had two kicks charged down for tries, interrupted a win for Ireland in a Test that showed the gap that still exists between the haves and have-nots of rugby",sport
"In truth, the USA have more than they once did: John Mitchells Eagles were well drilled and well lead by two overseas pros: Sale fly-half AJ MacGinty and New Zealander Tony Lamborn on the openside flank Still, a lack of time together and semi-pros in key positions fed into familiar problems: a scrum that struggled, a defensive line that ran ragged a little too soon Joe Schmidts Ireland, with two Lions starting and another on the bench, made holes and ran through them all game",sport
"Joey just sprained his ankle a bit, said Schmidt We thought it pertinent to get him off We dont know what the story is yet",sport
"Mitchell, a former All Blacks head coach, will leave the Eagles at the end of their summer series, which continues against Georgia next week and in a two-legged World Cup qualifier with CanadaWe were outclassed today, he said Were disappointed, defensively we had some issues with our setting which cost us",sport
"Two minutes in his marker, Martin Iosefo, rushed up, allowing space for Tiernan OHalloran to break a tackle and put Earls clear for a 35m run to the line Then, when Carbery made a half-gap of his own, Earls was straight through it to send a long, flat-ish-cum-forward pass out for the other wing, Jacob Stockdale, to score",sport
"Lamborn then made a half-break but couldnt complete the pass From the scrum, which Ireland pressured to keep the tired No8 David Tameilau bound and busy, came the try of the game Marmion scooted blind and released Earls once again, and though 70 metres later the full-back Ben Cima got him, and well, Earls popped a pass out of a tumble-dryer of arms and legs for Marmion to score",sport
"The US then had their best spell of the game, and the roar for what mightve been a third home try shook the stands  for a few seconds or so Alas, replacement prop Paddy Ryan  Irish-born, employed in the Premiership with Newcastle  threw forward a long pass after a fine break from the wing Mike Teo",sport
"Ryan Matyas did get over on 54 minutes for the Eagles third, this time patient phase play opening a half-gap Perhaps stung, a little, Ireland brought on the Munster wing Simon Zebo, a Lion in Australia four years ago Although the US scrambling defense was good, another Earls break put the substitute lock James Ryan over and replacement scrum-half Luke McGrath also scored as legs tired",sport

"Ryan Bertrand mustered a centre to exploit momentary hesitation, the Scots apparently distracted by a substitution on their right, only for Craig Gordon to react and turn away Kanes flashed header That was as close as he came until stoppage time, when it had appeared even the Royal Marines, Englands saviours last weekend on the infamous sheep dip on Woodbury Common, could not spare them the ignominy of defeat Southgate will delight in a point but will recognise plenty of failings from this showing",sport

"Ten Doeschate is mighty hard to defend against, too: tactically, he might be the best captain in the land, and  with this a case in point  he fights fires down the order, scoring all round the wicket, running brilliantly between the wickets (is there anyone better?) and punishing anything remotely looseThere were plenty of punchy drives, and a beautiful pulled six off Ravi Rampaul on the way to a 120-ball century",sport

"Dallass attempt was just the second on target that his side had mustered, ONeill seemingly satisfied to settle for a 0-0 stalemate But late goals have become a hallmark of this team in recent years and the winner ensured Northern Ireland would remain in second place in GroupC regardless of results later on Saturday night and they received a further boost when the Czech Republic were held 1-1 in Norway",sport
"The Azeris had been shell-shocked by the Northern Irish tactics in a 4-0 loss in November, conceding three times from dead-ball situations, and the first set piece here came in the third minute Evans glanced over from the corner and after some nervy early moments Robert Prosineckis defence settled into a composed unit that strung together lengthy spells of possession, yet rarely crossed the halfway lineOn one of the few occasions they did go long it produced a clear opening for Ramil Sheydaev, who raced beyond an injured McAuley only to rifle his attempt over when faced by Michael McGovern",sport
"The signs that this could be Northern Irelands night grew when Ismayilov blazed over as he closed on goal but there was still a sense of disbelief around the ground when Dallas scored in the second minute of stoppage time He owed much to Evanss decision to square it to him rather than shooting and the Leeds midfielder steadied himself before firing into the corner to spark jubilant scenes among the 300 or so travelling fans, who will now have a bit more hope that they might be travelling this far east again next summer",sport

"The only word to describe it is bedlam It was certainly difficult to make sense of that extraordinary finale other than to say that, ultimately, Harry Kane showed everyone right at the end why Gareth Southgate had made him captain for the day It was the 93rd minute when Kane denied Scotland their football, bloody hell moment and, in the process, that feat of escapology might have helped to secure him the armband on a longerbasis",sport
"That, however, tells only part of the story on a day when both sides experienced the exhilarating joys and excruciating disappointments of football, all in the space of a few minutes For Scotland, in particular, it was an agonising way to finish a wild and eccentric encounter Yet England will have their own frustrations bearing in mind they had been drifting towards a relatively prosaic 1-0 win before all that late drama when Leigh Griffiths brought the home crowd to a point of rare euphoria",sport
The two free-kicks that Griffiths expertly placed beyond Joe Hart came in the 87th and 90th minutes and it is doubtful Hampden has ever made a more deafening roar than when the second one curled into the England net,sport
"Their grief was understandable but when they have time to reflect they should not to be too disheartened when, to put it into context, Gordon Strachans starting lineup featured three players from teams that will begin next season in Englands second tier and a centre-half, Charlie Mulgrew, who had just been relegated to League One with Blackburn RoversIf there was an imbalance of talent, Scotland seemed determined to make up for it in other ways They were quick to the ball, strong in the tackle and could never be accused of lacking effort They also had a captain, Scott Brown, who quickly gave the impression that whatever Englands players encountered alongside the Royal Marines last weekend was going to be chickenfeed compared to 90 minutes in his company Browns first challenge on Dele Alli  a reducer, to use the old-fashioned parlance  earned him a yellow card inside the opening three minutes and he was fortunate, in the extreme, to stay on after another hack at the same player shortly after Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, one of Englands substitutes, had opened the scoring",sport
"England had taken a while to settle but once they cleared their heads of any early uncertainty they had enough of the ball in promising positions to have made it a more straightforward assignment and that, perhaps, was the biggest disappointment for Southgate Englands supporters had started going through their victory songs just before Griffiths turned the game upside down",sport
"Strachan reflected that he had never heard a noise like it when the second one went in, leaving him on the verge of what he noted wistfully would have been the best result of his managerial career England, however, set about rescuing themselves with all the competitive courage that Southgate had talked about in the buildup to the match",sport
"It was an onslaught once the public announcer let everyone knew there would be four minutes of stoppage time and, finally, the substitute Raheem Sterling picked out Kane England needed their captain and it was an elegant finish given the pressure on that moment and the consequences if he had failedThis England side are dangerous when they play with freedom, as Australia discovered in the West Midlands Colosseum",sport
"On a surface that invited strokeplay, especially when there was pace on the ball, this pair had a packed house salivating in between singing: Cheerio, cheerio, cheerio, to their favourite rivals Both left-handers were in sublime form",sport
"Sometimes Englands captain shimmied down the pitch to the Australian pacemen to crack the ball through the covers At others he stayed back to smash it square One of his sixes, an instinctive swipe off Josh Hazlewood, just kept going  defying the wind and the longest boundary",sport
"Alex Hales was caught at slip off Hazlewood for a duck and Joe Root edged to the keeper just before the first interruption for rain It was 35 for three and briefly England might have been relieved that this was a free gameHowever, it transpired that three early wickets were not enough for Australia, just as four were insufficient for New Zealand against Bangladesh",sport
The boundaries are reasonably big here but not large enough to contain Morgan in this form He hit five sixes and could only be dispatched via a chaotic run out after 159 had been added Stokes spooned towards mid-on and scampered for a run; Morgan watched the ball rather than his partner and Adam Zampas throw lit up the stumps,sport
Warriors forward Draymond Green made no secret of how he feels about Cleveland fans in the aftermath of the Warriors 137-116 loss in Game 4 of the NBA finals on Friday at Quicken Loans Arena,sport
"I dont pay that much attention to anybody in Cleveland, honestly, he said",sport
"Green was the target of a hostile reception from the home crowd throughout the lopsided defeat, which denied the Warriors a finals sweep and the first perfect postseason in league historyChants of Draymond sucks were audible whenever the Golden State firebrand was at the center of the action, never more than a controversial sequence during the third quarter which saw Green nearly ejectedA year after his antics on this floor led to a suspension for Game 5 that began the Warriors historic collapse, Green was again in the middle of the nights strangest scene",sport
"The 27-year-old appeared to be ejected when he was called for what the Cavs and Warriors thought was his second technical midway through the third quarter He waved his arms in frustration at an official after being called for fouling Kevin Love and was hit with the tech, which would have triggered an automatic ejection",sport
"But Green didnt leave the court, and referees said the technical they called after Greens foul with 1:55 remaining in the first quarter was on Kerr  though the official box score had it listed as GreenNo announcement was ever made correcting the error, not that Green was listening for oneKerr said he thought the first technical was called on Green  though said he thought he deserved it  and believed his power forward was going to have to leave the floor when the one was called in the third quarter",sport
"But Green stood stoically on the floor, then egged on the crowd to raise the decibel level of their jeers toward him He said he knew all along the first tech wasnt on him",sport
"I knew because the first tech on Steve, which I didnt understand, Mike Callahan came up to John (Goble) and asked him who was the tech on and he said Kerr, Green said So I knew I didnt have a technical foul, but still trying to figure out why did I get the second oneThe box was changed after the third quarter to indicate Kerr had received the first technical",sport
"The officials acknowledged after the game they did not handle the situation very wellGoble said he thought he had verbalized to the table that the initial technical was on Kerr, but said after watching the video that he should have done a better job with that The problem then worsened when the officials didnt catch the public address announcer saying it was called on Green",sport
The procedure is to advise the table who the technical foul is on and with the player we give a number,sport
"So even though Friday was a bad night for the Warriors, at least they head home with good newsThank God I get to play in Game 5, Green said",sport
"For the first time in its four-year history, the Womens Tour of Britain will enjoy a grandstand finale in the centre of London on Sunday, and Polands Kasia Niewiadoma will have every right to enjoy the occasion after dominating the three days of racing since her solo victory on Wednesdays first stage from Daventry to Kettering, where she carved out a 1min 46sec lead that has proved impregnable, in spite of the best efforts of her rivalsOn the toughest stage of the Womens Tour, 122km out and back, a finish close to the church with the twisted spire, the Dutch teams Sunweb and Boels-Dolman both put the 22-year-old under pressure Sunweb placed their Canadian rider Leah Kirchmann in an escape that lasted more than 90km, surviving to the finish, where Australias Sarah Roy took the stage winBoels-Dolman used the strength of the 2016 winner, Lizzie Deignan, to claw back the early three-woman escape, including Kirchmann, to within reach of the peloton before  in a classic tactical move  sending their best hope for the overall title, Luxembourgs Christine Majerus, across to join Kirchmanns group with 50km remainingTogether with Roy and Shara Gillow, of the FDJ team, Kirchmann and Majerus raced into a lead of more than two minutes, with Niewiadoma isolated in a select chasing group that had formed during the excruciatingly tough opening phase, which alternated leg-breaking climbs and greasy twisting descents",sport
"However, the chasing group swelled as riders left behind in the early kilometres regained contact, and a chase  led notably by the Canyon-SRAM team-mates of the British national champion Hannah Barnes  brought the peloton to almost within touching distance of the escapees by the finishThis was one of the hardest races Ive ever ridden, said Niewiadoma, the under-23 European champion There were lots and lots of short and steep climbs; after a while I was completely done in, and then I had to think about controlling the other teams",sport
"In April, during the Ardennes Classics, Niewiadoma offered a taste of the form she has enjoyed this week, matching Deignan and the Olympic champion Anna Van der Breggen in Amstel Gold, Flche Wallonne and Lige-Bastogne-Lige Her victory on Sunday should be a clear-cut one, but that proviso has a little more bite to it than usual The unexpected can always happen, as evidenced by a freak crash on the finish line that sent the stage winner, Roy, to hospital",sport
"With echoes of Deignans high-speed accident on the opening stage in 2015, Roy sprinted up the cobbled street in front of Chesterfields market hall, about 10 metres in front of Majerus and Kirchmann, with the peloton breathing down their necks behind; as she raised her hands in the air to celebrate after crossing the line, she lost control of her front wheel on the bouncy cobbles, jack-knifed her bike and landed heavily on her right sideRoy was not alone in finding Derbyshire a road of pain",sport
"The Olympic road race champion, Katie Archibald, finished with blood streaming down her right leg and her jersey ripped, after a crash 10km from the finish She crossed the line on the coat-tails of the bunch and dropped to 19th overall She is now out of the running for the prize of best Briton, which has proved an entertaining subplot, acted out by the Barnes sisters, Hannah and Alice After the younger sibling, Alice, took the jersey on Friday, thanks to a fine second place in Leamington, it went to Hannah on Saturday thanks to a strong fifth place and a fortuitous split in the peloton in the uphill finishThe 79 survivors will be more than conscious of the recent background to Sundays climax in the British capital, if the feelings of the Queen of the Mountains, Audrey Cordon, are anything to go by",sport

"Appleby mopped up the first two races with a couple of two-year-olds, a division in which he has had notable success this year, which may have led, indirectly, to Tuesdays resignation of John Ferguson Saeed bin Suroor, Godolphins other main trainer, appears to believe the division of two-year-olds this year has been somewhat unfair and indeed he is yet to have even a single runner from that age group, while Appleby has now had 10 winners from 15 runners",sport
"Bin Suroors only runner on Saturday was at Haydock, so he was at least spared the sight of seeing Appleby making so many trips to the winners enclosure  including after the first race with the debutant Glorious Journey, who cost 26m at auction in October, when Ferguson was doing the bidding",sport
"Regally bred, the colt has clearly generated quite a lot of expectation at Godolphin, prompting a reporter to ask Appleby if he was relieved about this initial successDenying it, the trainer replied cheerily: Do I look like Theresa May? For the record, there is not much of a likeness and Appleby also appears much more willing than the prime minister to address difficult subjects in public, since he responded to a question about Fergusons decision to quit and how it affected the organisation",sport
"John made his decision and felt it was the right one, Appleby said",sport
"For myself, Im employed by Godolphin to race horses and prepare them to the best of my ability with the team I have and thats what I shall carry on doing",sport
"In Bin Suroors case, this is not much of a change, since it seems he decided to cut Ferguson out of the chain of command some time ago If the Sheikh decides to appoint a new racing manager, that person will surely view the winning of Bin Suroors trust and support as job No1 Whatever the fairness or otherwise of the way horses have been split between the two trainers up to now, Bin Suroor, a native Dubaian who clearly has the Sheikhs ear, can expect to get the cream in the future",sport

"Tell it to Murray, who operated at considerably more draining level and admitted his legs had gone in the end against Wawrinka Quick wins do matter in seven, best-of-five matches  it is absurd to suggest otherwise  so the advantage is most definitely with NadalHowever, Federer does not call his compatriot Diesel for nothing",sport
"Things like this are not supposed to happen In just her eighth grand slam event, the unseeded, fearless Jelena Ostapenko produced a stunning fightback to win the French Open title here",sport
"In the absence of Serena Williams, Maria Sharapova and Victoria Azarenka, all missing for a variety of reasons, this years French Open had been considered one of the most open of all time Halep, most peoples favourite after winning in Madrid and reaching the final in Rome, was expected to be able to tame Ostapenko and when she withstood an early barrage of groundstrokes from the Latvian to take the first set, the 25-year-old was on trackKnowing Ostapenko was capable of reeling off winners seemingly at will, Halep was well aware she needed to stay patient, accept when she was outhit and wait for the mistakes, while taking any chance she had to be aggressive She must have hoped that Ostapenko would freeze on the big occasion but instead the Latvian looked relatively relaxed The simplicity of her game means she does not second-guess herself, as she proved in beating players such as Sam Stosur and Caroline Wozniacki en route",sport
"She had also come from a set down three times on her way to the final and when Halep failed to take any of her three break points at 3-0 in the second set, she had hope That translated into belief when she cracked several winners on her way to levelling at 3-3 and when she broke for 4-3, she whipped up a crowd who were already willing her on, gasping at times at the ferocity of her flatly-struck groundstrokes",sport
"At the start of the third, Halep saved two break points and then broke on her way to a 3-1 lead as Ostapenkos radar went astray as she sprayed the ball long and wide, her focus dipping for a moment",sport
"However, from 3-1 down she broke back for 3-3 and then, thanks to a bit of outrageous fortune when she got a dead net cord on a backhand that had been heading way wide, the 20-year-old broke to lead 4-3Finally in front in the match for the first time, Ostapenko might have blinked but she held serve brilliantly for 5-3 At 30-40 on the Halep serve, Ostapenko had match point and she rifled an unstoppable backhand down the line to clinch victory, leaping in the air and turning in delight in the direction of her two coaches, her mother and the former Spanish player, Anabel Medina, who had been on the edge of their courtside seats throughout",sport
"Both players struggled on second serve and though Halep may chastise herself for not attacking more, she rarely had the chance Ostapenko defended well when she needed to and as soon as she got in position, or even sometimes when she was not, she slapped the ball at break-neck speed",sport
"Halep will be world No2 when the womens rankings are updated on Monday and she was gracious in defeat All the credit for what you have done, she said",sport

"The England lock George Kruis, meanwhile, has suggested the Lions could do a lot worse than adopt a similarly aggressive defensive gameplan against the All Blacks We talk about how we want to be a brutal pack, a set-piece dominant pack I think today we showed good signs of that, said the Saracen",sport
"We thought they were going to play that way and we couldnt negate that but Steve will do his homework, said Robertson, hailing Owen Farrell as the man the All Blacks will particularly need to counter Hes world-class and can see both the game and the space",sport
Hewett carried his momentum into the third set to add his first grand slam singles title to double Paralympic silver from Rio last summer and a Wimbledon doubles title There were a few tears but no great outpouring of emotion from Hewett who had a doubles final to come after with Reid The British pair went on to lose against Frances Stphane Houdet and Nicolas Peifer 6-4 6-3,sport
"Celebrations on Saturday night will be limited to a pizza before he heads home to see his parents, brother and sister, who were following from the UK",sport

"I had a good feeling about this week This time last year I was outside the top 10, hadnt really won anything",sport
"He even had an obvious culpritI think it came from (Warriors forward) Draymond (Green), James added",sport
"The most honest words uttered so far in these finals came from Cavs guard Kyrie Irving who said: We see everything, Ill be sitting up here lying (if I said) we didnt see itIf there is one truth about todays NBA players its that they read and hear every word said about them Players are constantly griping about seemingly innocuous lines from weeks-old stories or stray comments thrown out on radio shows",sport
"In other words, the Cavs  who still possess the most recent Larry OBrien trophy  were well-aware that the Warriors have become the Showtime Lakers, Jordan Bulls and 1960s Celtics all in one",sport
A lot went against the Warriors on Friday,sport
"But Game 4 was about the leagues current champion refusing to cede historic greatness to a team they beat last springThey were aggressive, you have to give them some credit, said Green, who nonetheless still complained that so many Warriors were in early foul trouble that they couldnt be as aggressive as they wantedTheres still some pride in Cleveland",sport
"Still not very pretty, but mightily effective against Super Rugbys only unbeaten team this year  and as Warren Gatland said: We needed that, didnt we? He has repeatedly claimed that only the Test series matters, but while there was palpable relief on his face after the criticism that followed the Blues defeat, you get the feeling he had targeted this match as the opportunity for the Lions to announce their arrival Certainly they had a far more cohesive gameplan  with aggressive, suffocating defence at its heart  and his side were far more composed, finishing aside",sport
"Gatland has been lukewarm to the idea of playing Jonathan Sexton and Farrell together, but with the Ireland fly-half finding his best form from the bench, we may well see them paired together against the Maori All Blacks next Saturday With Teo also on the pitch, interchanging with Farrell, it made for a robust midfield and the Lions benefited from having two playmakers Indeed, their ability to adapt after losing Davies and Hogg in the first half was impressive, and the back-line that ended the match may well start the first Test It would be bold to start Watson at full-back, but the others now have it all to do against the Highlanders on Tuesday if they are to make the Test XVFor much of this season, Dustin Johnsons dominance was such that the Masters and US Open looked like a race for second",sport
"While he will understandably have a successful defence of the US Open from Thursday as prime motivation, the other leading lights have been afforded hope at Erin Hills in Wisconsin",sport
"Unlike Johnson and the vast majority of the field, Spieth has playing experience of the course  from the US Amateur ChampionshipI know nothing about it, said Johnson Before I injured myself, I was playing really well Everything was just really solid But its getting back to where I feel like where Im getting a lot more comfortable and a lot more confident in the game",sport
"Erin Hills will be subject to intense scrutiny, as will those who preside over the second major of the year",sport
"Theyve taken criticism for the last two years, Im sure theyre not liking it, said Adam Scott, the 2013 Masters champion Theyre going to have to try to run a really good event The ball is in their court; they control it all Hopefully, they get it right this time, just from a playability standpoint Lets just have something thats a challenge and interesting, not just playing brutal golf",sport

"Give or take the finer details, Solankes was a depressingly familiar situation among English players of a similar age Perhaps that will change if the Under-20s win their first final at this tournament and there is a sense that the current crop have a momentum that previous generations found hard to musterWe knew that weve got a winning bunch of players and weve got to repeat that, Solanke said after that 3-1 semi-final win over Italy, referencing the Uefa Under-17 Championship title the core of the squad won together in 2014Solanke scored Englands goal in the final against Holland, which was decided on penalties; it appears not to have been a flash in the pan and when the players return for pre-season with their clubs  all bar four in the top flight  scrutiny over their use and treatment can be expected to intensifyThe cautious conclusion in Solankes case is that, whether or not England win the trophy and regardless of whether he scores the two goals that would almost certainly win the golden boot award outright, the tools are in place for the Premier League",sport
"He has won admiration from those who have seen him work up close  particularly the Under-20s manager, Paul Simpson  for the way he handled his exile at Chelsea and has grown into this World Cup after, perhaps understandably, looking a shade below his best in his first two games",sport
"Style wise, Solanke is a rangy figure who, rather than appearing awkward, has the strength and awareness to threaten when playing up against defenders or in deeper areas He needs to be playing regularly at a high level now; so, too, do team-mates such as the Everton forward Ademola Lookman and the Bournemouth midfielder Lewis Cook",sport
"If a lack of success in high-pressure situations has contributed to English clubs caution towards using young players, will an unprecedented victory this summer bring a change in mindset?Venezuela need to be negotiated first and that, despite the countrys lack of presence as a power at senior level, is far from assured",sport
"England will have the benefit of freshness after their opponents required extra-time to win all three of their knock-out games, but they will have to be wary of the forward Adalberto Pearanda  who is on Watfords books and has trodden a familiar-looking path in spells at Granada and Udinese  as well as Sergio Crdova, whose four-goal tally equals that of SolankeThey are highly dangerous players but Englands biggest challenge may lie more in the mind  a situation that their distance from home, with few fans and media scrambling to make the 11-hour flight at short notice, perhaps improves Interest and pressure may be ramping up before a first World Cup final at any significant level since 1966, but they are conveniently isolatedEveryones going to be rooting for us back home so hopefully we can make them proud, Solanke said If England do, their centre-forward might consider that those months on the sidelines were eventually well worth it",sport
"Had the Lions not lost Stuart Hogg and Jonathan Davies to head injuries inside the first half-hour and not let three potential try-scoring chances slip away it might have been even more convincing As it was Farrell and Conor Murray exerted impressive tactical control behind a pack that at last showed signs of living up to its advertised potential George Kruis, Jamie George, Mako Vunipola, Peter OMahony and Sean OBrien did not feature in everyones starting Test XV before the tour started, but along with Tadhg Furlong, Alun Wyn Jones and Taulupe Faletau they all enhanced their reputations in these parts",sport
"It was a cracking encounter from start to finish, with the sides fully committed and pumped up on a cold evening Two Farrell penalties gave the Lions an early advantage and their biggest early concern was the stray elbow from the otherwise excellent Murray that inadvertently struck his own full-back and forced the bloodied Hogg from the fieldThe Lions backline resources were further stretched when Davies was led away for a head injury assessment at the request of medical staff",sport
"Luckily their forwards already had the bit between their teeth with the home side, not helped by a slightly slippery, dew-laden ball, initially struggling to claim restarts and losing their first three lineouts The Lions also had some joy in the scrums against an all-international front row, aside from one backpedalling loss of control that resulted in a mass scuffle and a penalty to the Crusaders, who had won all of their 17 games this year",sport
"For a brief moment, as Murray burst away upfield with the French referee, Mathieu Raynal, playing advantage, it seemed as if the Lions might be looking at a hefty interval advantage but an attempted pass off the floor by Jones found a lurking Crusader instead of one of his own team-mates",sport
The Lions wasted another points-scoring opportunity when a poor right to left pass from Ben Teo made life unnecessarily hard for Liam Williams outside of him,sport
"What a contest that will be if the All Blacks can be hassled and harried defensively, given scant time to think and repeatedly turned by the pinpoint kicking of Murray and Farrell",sport

"Kane, ironically, was one of the players who crumbled, booed by the teams own supporters and warranting three out of ten in LEquipes ratings the next day One bad night, however, should not be held against him forever, especially when he has just won the Premier Leagues golden boot, and Southgate should probably not be criticised for devoting so much attention to his mission of developing more leaders within the group, with the emphasis on the pluralThat process took in a overnight trip to Woodbury Common last weekend when the players began their preparations for the Scotland game by mucking in with the Royal Marines",sport
"There was the question of whether he could transfer that into matches because he wasnt playing for Spurs at the time, but hes done that now",sport
"Plus Kane is another reminder, in a week when England have reached the final of the Under-20s World Cup, that England is capable of bringing through elite footballers Everybody knocks youth development, Southgate said Our coaching gets knocked, our youth development gets knocked, our young players get knocked but why shouldnt young English players be able to achieve?We have clubs searching the world to bring in young players, some of whom are outstanding but others who are maybe not as good as the players who are already there under the clubs noses And if weve got a team in a World Cup final at that age group, why are we looking around the world?When a furious Jordan Pickford conceded a goal during a training exercise with Englands Under-21s at St Georges Park this week, he whacked and burst one of the inflatable mannequins that had been put up to complicate the strikers route to goal I just dont like conceding, he explains with an endearing chuckle",sport
It would have been better if we had stayed up; my heart is massive towards the club,sport
"His description of how he became ready for it begins with a memory from his early childhood, when his brother Richard, six years his senior, would invite him to kickabouts with the instruction: Get on the tarmac and dive about lad He went on to hone his talent in the more formal surrounds of Sunderlands academy and then, after turning professional in 2011, spent loan stints at a variety of Football League clubs, most recently at Preston North End in the 2015-16 season, when he kept 14 clean sheets in 30 matches That was proving that I was good enough, he says with the confidence he has gained from working his way up steadilyAnother sign of that confidence, and his readiness, was the way he hollered instructions at veteran defenders as soon as he was thrust into Sunderlands first team Around the place Im just myself really but as soon as you cross that white line I feel its my job and Im here to do it and get the lads going, he says",sport
"Pickford is all about the bottom line The saves he cherishes most are not the most acrobatic or difficult ones but the ones that matter most I go back to the [Peter] Schmeichel thing: you save it how you have to, any way that you can Technique goes out the window sometimes So his favourite stop in his career was the close-range one he made to prevent Leicester Citys Wes Morgan from equalising in the sixth minute of stoppage time at the Stadium of Light in December",sport
"The Lions had beaten the All Blacks in a series for the first and, so far, the only time They had been away for three months",sport
"That was Carwyn James, whose achievement in New Zealand remains unequalled by any of his successors At 41, and taking a chunk of unpaid time off from his day job as teacher of Welsh and head of rugby and cricket at Llandovery College, James was already a man of many facets, some of them seemingly contradictory: a lover of literature and the theatre, a deacon at his village chapel, a 40-a-day cigarette smoker fond of wine and gin, a compelling columnist (for this newspaper) and broadcaster, a solitary man yet a lover of company and stories and singing",sport
"Although a confirmed Welsh nationalist who stood in the 1970 general election as a representative of Plaid Cymru, he viewed the task of coaching the Lions as one of reconciling the characteristics of the four nations And he did it his way, a way that persuaded the members of his squad to lay down their deep-rooted national rivalries Lasting friendships were formed that would have seemed impossible before the party assembled to listen to an introductory speech given by a coach known to the Welsh players for his prowess as a fly-half and later coach with Llanelli, but who was a complete unknown to others",sport
"Years later he put it this way: The very first thing I said to them was: Look here, be your own man",sport
"I thought of him this week when Eddie Jones, the England coach, spoke of making his players into participants rather than mere recipients, as if this were something new",sport
"But Spencer also called him a great organiser, and he was meticulous in his preparation An amateur in an amateur game, he brought a professionals commitment to the task as he assembled dossiers on their opponents, visited Matt Busby to talk about Manchester Uniteds training methods and called on Eric Ashton at Wigan to see how rugby leagues champions went about their workIt was amusing to hear Sean Fitzpatrick, speaking in the aftermath of the 2017 tourists defeat by the Auckland Blues, suggesting that their task against the Crusaders on Saturday will be easier because therell be a lot more structure to the game  implying that spontaneity is alien to the Lions culture In 1971, James gave his players a structure within which their individual creativity could find its fullest expressionWhen it was all over, the defeated captain paid him a high compliment: He kept a unity that transferred itself to the pitch, the great Colin Meads said",sport

"On the basis that if even Gordon Strachan had abandoned hope of Scotland defeating England then the fixture would be pointless, perhaps the managers faith is understandable History, recent and distant, is hardly in Strachans favour: Scotland have beaten England six times in 50 years and taken seven points from five matches in the latest quest to end a miserable absence from major championshipsI dont think this is a free hit, I really dont think its like that, said Strachan",sport

"Strachan, as is typical, swatted aside any discussion of this game being crucial to his own situation Im OK Im fine, he said",sport
"Strachan is believed to have considered a three-man defence as the most legitimate means of handling England but may feel he lacks the resources to deploy that formation His two most serious calls would appear to be in the wide right attacking position  where James Forrest and Ryan Fraser are candidates to play and at centre-forward, with Leigh Griffiths and Chris Martin the options",sport

"One quirk of previous encounters may be on Strachans side: the presence of his opposite number, Gareth Southgate, in the England team for the visit of Scotland in 1999 was sufficient for Don Hutchison to be belatedly drafted into the visiting lineup at Wembley Hutchison scored to secure Scotland a 1-0 win",sport

"Arsenal played the first half of their game with a ball covered with shiny, enamel paint  the same stuff that was applied to golf balls  and the second half with one with a matt finish The Athletic News correspondent noticed particularly how the ball showed up against the dark background of the spectators standing on the popular terracing, and declared it was obvious that on a really dull day the white ball would be an enormous advantage from a spectators point of viewThose actually on the field, however, were less overwhelmed",sport

"Calderhead had been one of the white balls vocal critics, perhaps because he was concentrating on alternative innovations, with his Chelsea side preparing to experiment for the first time with the use of numbered jerseys in a trial match the following Monday Though it had been witnessed in a couple of amateur internationals at club level this was a true first, and though Calderhead declared it certainly helpful, particularly from the spectators point of view he said he was not certain if it is worth putting it up to the Football Association councilThis too had a hostile reception",sport

"White balls would get their turn, though they had to wait a while The late 1940s saw several colour-based oddities, with the winter of 1946-47, the snowiest of the 20th century, prompting Southend to paint their touchlines red and Reading to turn their goalposts blue, and soon alternatives to brown leather balls were being considered once againOf particular importance on the white balls road to acceptance was a televised match between England and Italy at White Hart Lane in 1949 when a white ball was used in fading light towards the end at the insistence of the Fifa president, Sir Stanley Rous, who felt that against the background of high stands at White Hart Lane the ordinary ball becomes almost invisible in the air when the night is fallingAfter that game the leagues secretary, F Howarth, sniffed that I do not think the ball offered many advantages over the ordinary one, but it had been well received by the watching public and the FA resolved to keep experimenting: in February 1950 England B played Switzerland B at Hillsborough with a bright yellow ball being used in the first half, and a garish orange one in the second The big push came the following year, the first to see top-level competitive floodlit football",sport
"Big players given an advantage on mud declare that this compensates them for the start and finish of the season when conditions favour smaller men, it wrote They insist that the light ball, used as a counter to mud, penalises themIn 1953 the FA recommended that white balls should be used from the start or not at all, though this remained at the referees discretion That November, Hungary showed quite how much it assisted more technical players when they put a white ball into the England net six times at WembleyThe greatest possible advert for their use came with the arrival of another Hungarian team the following year, for what must surely rank among the most important friendlies in the history of the game, most probably at No1",sport

"Hansens remarks were more complimentary than insulting and clearly self-serving The underlying message seemed to be that he would rather the Lions try to take on the All Blacks at their own game, which is regarded as throwing the ball around and taking risks, than have them play for territory and drive through the forwards, exposing his players to a game they are not familiar with",sport

"Successful teams now, like New Zealand and Saracens, see the lineout as a licence to score tries by exploiting space rather than sending a juggernaut on a rumble The Wales way, as it was with the scrum, witness the 2013 Six Nations decider against England, was to use it first as a means of gaining a penalty",sport
"The ploy was devised at a time when the pace of the game was slower and attacking teams were given less latitude at the breakdown by referees For all their battering of England in 2013, Wales only scored two tries, both in the final quarter, but more are needed now",sport
"It was a clash of styles: the set-piece superiority of the Lions against the ball-handling skills and opportunism of the Blues The Lions were more coordinated than they had been on Saturday and they tried to play with continuity, but they were exposed to a game that is foreign to the Six Nations and not prevalent in any of the major leagues in Europe: the skill of the Blues, who had three tries ruled out on review, trumped power",sport
"Why did Joe Schmidt, a New Zealander, all but outlaw the offload after taking charge of Ireland? Why did Gatland, another Kiwi, adopt a rigid gameplan with Wales having lamented, like Graham Henry before him, that innate talent was not complemented by basic skills such as passing? Because they recognised that players in Europe were generally less skilful and intuitive than in New Zealand and so they played to the strength of their charges Eddie Jones has spent most of his time in charge of England talking about the need for players to take more decisions, appreciating that unless they are able to produce plays such as the one that won the match for the Blues, they will struggle to wrest the World Cup off the All BlacksAttacks on Warrenball are misdirected: it is the game as a whole in Europe, starting with the complacent Six Nations which bills itself as the greatest tournament in the world, which it will only have a chance of becoming if countries start finding tickets hard to sell, that is being questionedA common excuse for conservatism in the Six Nations in the opening rounds is the weather It rained in Auckland, but the adventure of the home side was not dampened",sport

Kane Williamson appeared locked on a course that would steer his side to their target of 311,sport
"A glance at Buttlers strike-rate of 127 would suggest him simply putting on his latest clinic in power-hitting Instead this was more workmanlike, in his own way, as New Zealands attack began slamming the ball into the surface at varying speeds to leave the batsman needing to force the issueThe situation in which Buttler found himself, with England 188 for four in the 34th over after Joe Roots Welsh drag-on with 64 to his name, was in many ways tailor-made for his talents, and yet it was not until his 24th ball faced that a boundary came",sport

"Significantly, Pacific Island teams  Fiji (1987) and Western Samoa (1991 and 1995)  reached the quarter-finals in the first three amateur World Cups, but only one (Fiji in 2007) has made the top eight of the tournament in the professional era",sport

"Critically one of those mischievous deliveries was directed at Kane Williamson and it would produce the key dismissal Williamson had batted calmly for 87 and New Zealand, on 158 for two, were on course when Mark Wood ran up to bowl The Kiwi captain, disconcerted by steep bounce, ended up gloving the ball to Jos Buttler behind the stumps; he left staring angrily at the surface, a signal that would not have a benign effect on his dressing room",sport
Now England seized their chance magnificently,sport
"As a consequence the game was almost unrecognisable, especially when the bowling was from the Taff end The boundary there is perilously short even in normal conditions so later in the innings the Kiwi bowlers tried to take the straight hit out of the equation Hence they bowled a succession of bouncers, fast and slow, so that the batsmen had to hit towards the long boundary and crucially into the wind",sport
"Thereafter England were indebted to significant rather than major contributions from Alex Hales, Joe Root, Stokes and Buttler As at The Oval against Bangladesh, Hales was dismissed straight after hitting a six, something for him to ponderRoot purred as usual, caressing two sixes off the left-arm spinner, Mitchell Santner, in the knowledge that he only had to clear mid-on In his partnership with Stokes he was frequently denied the strike (he faced 15 balls to Stokess 37) and this seemed to upset his rhythm He wasbowled off his inside edge, almost his first false shot",sport
"Stokes, who hit some wonderfully crisp boundaries, in between the dots was caught at third man and then Buttler did his stuff In fact he was not as fluent as usual; his first boundary came from his 24th delivery and that was an edge over the keeper, but he was never becalmed",sport
British Cycling is poised to sever its last remaining physical ties with Team Sky by asking the professional squad to move out of the Manchester velodrome which they have used as a shared home for the past seven yearsBoard members at British Cycling are understood to have pushed for a discernible split between the two organisations which have shared a base and personnel since Team Sky were founded in 2010,sport
"The closeness of the two has been the source of great consternation during the past 14 months as each lurched from one damaging episode to anotherWhile British Cycling was fighting claims of a culture of favouritism and bullying made by the sprint rider Jess Varnish, it was also dragged into the crisis surrounding Team Sky, Sir Bradley Wiggins and a mystery medical package delivered to the rider at the end of the Critrium du Dauphin race in June 2011While Team Sky also have bases in France and Belgium they still rent office space from British Cycling at the velodrome on the outskirts of Manchester which its director of business operations, Fran Millar, uses and where the team principal, Sir Dave Brailsford, regularly holds meetingsBut this is likely to come to an end after various British Cycling stakeholders determined a divide to be the best way forward Team Sky are thought to be looking for another location in Manchester to set up home",sport
"Brailsford was the architect of both teams successes, forming Team Sky on the back of British Cyclings huge medal haul at the Beijing Olympics in 2008 Initially they shared medical personnel and facilities, intellectual property and mechanics",sport
"By early 2010 it was deemed necessary to instruct the consultancy firm Deloitte at a cost of 40,000, shared by UK Sport and British Cycling, to conduct a review into possible conflicts of interest",sport
"Last year Sky dropped its backing for the participation programme and was replaced by HSBC but continue to back the professional Team Sky programme, standing by Brailsford and the riders amid a range of controversiesBritish Cycling insists it no longer shares personnel with Team Sky and that any joint resources have been drastically scaled back over the past three years",sport

"The blurred relationship between the two was heavily criticised by Collins and his select committee colleagues, and the British Cycling chairman, Jonathan Browning, said this year it would be subject of further examination He said at the time: There are some areas where there will be benefit of supporting each other and sharing but they need to be very clearly defined and boundaries drawn between the two organisations I would characterise the separation as substantial now",sport

"Joe Osborne, managing director of Godolphin in Ireland and a key figure in setting up a branch of the operation in China, will now serve as interim chief executive of Godolphins global operation and is well placed to keep the job long term Based at Kildangan Stud, Osborne is another longstanding employee of the Sheikh and the son of Michael Osborne, credited by the Sheikh with establishing the Dubai World Cup as a major international race",sport
"Ive known Joe a long number of years, said Jim Bolger, who trained Dawn Approach to win the 2000 Guineas for Godolphin Hes a thorough gentleman, very familiar with all aspects of thoroughbred breeding and racingBolger said Osborne is more than capable of handling the new role which has suddenly dropped into his lap",sport

"Southampton have reported Liverpool to the Premier League for allegedly making an illegal approach to Virgil van DijkThe south-coast club were furious to see stories on Monday that suggested Liverpool were in the driving seat to sign the defender this summer, in the face of interest from other leading clubs  namely Chelsea and Manchester CityThey argue that there is no way the stories could have been run unless Liverpool had spoken to Van Dijk and, thereby, put themselves in breach of Premier League rules over tapping up Several of the stories contained the line that Van Dijk wanted to move to Anfield because of Jrgen Klopps involvement in his recruitment  which Southampton suggest adds up to an illegal approach It is understood that the Dutchmans preference is to move to Anfield",sport
"Southampton have made it clear to the Premier League they have received no official approach from Liverpool for Van Dijk and, more generally, they have stressed the player has five years to run on his contract, meaning they are in a strong position regarding where he does playLiverpool are reportedly willing to pay a world-record sum for a defender  expected to be around 60m  to break Southamptons resistance and they are also prepared to match Citys offer to Van Dijk of a contract worth around 200,000 a week Van Dijk would become Liverpools record signing and highest-paid player should the deal go ahead",sport
"Puel, who arrived in June of last year, led Saints to the EFL Cup final, which they lost to Manchester United, and an eighth-placed finish in the league But his style of football has frequently been derided as turgid, the team have struggled for goals and when the French manager was booed by the St Marys crowd on the final day of the season against Stoke City, the writing was on the wallPuel sat down with the board for an end-of-season review, which did not go well, and there have since been no messages of support for him from the hierarchy He is away on holiday and has emerged as a target for the French club St-tienneSouthampton accept that Puel will be entitled to a pay-off on the final two years of his contract and they want a manager who is receptive to promoting players from the academy and with a vision for attractive, passing football",sport
There was something familiar about Gianluigi Buffon hoisting the Serie A trophy aloft after the game against Crotone at the end of May,sport
"Back in 2011-12 Juve claimed their first title in this sequence with 84 points Roma and Napoli exceeded that number this season, and yet neither has looked close to dislodging the BianconeriThe standard of the league is decidedly uneven Juventus have re-established themselves as one of the best teams on the planet, and to some extent have dragged the chasing pack up with them Napoli play some of the most entertaining football in Europe, and acquitted themselves better against Real Madrid in the Champions League this season than the 6-2 aggregate defeat suggested",sport
"But there is a significant gap between those teams and the next tier Lazio and Atalanta  the latter especially impressive for their development of homegrown talent  were compelling, but neither truly threatened the top three The Milan clubs seem to be trapped in permanent disarray  albeit both are expected to spend big under new Chinese owners this summer",sport
"Overall, it is a mixed picture",sport
"Spanish football does have more than two clubs: Atltico Madrid won the title three years ago and have reached two of the past four Champions League finals That underlines the fact that if Spain is a two-horse race  and theres an element of that, Madrid and Barcelona having won all bar one of the past 10 titles  it is not because the rest are a bunch of donkeys Sevilla, Athletic Bilbao, Celta Vigo and Villarreal have in recent years reached semi-finals or beyond in Europe, which Spanish football has dominated",sport
"Meanwhile, this season has not lacked surprises Madrid dropped points against Eibar and Las Palmas Barcelona lost the title against Deportivo, Celta and Mlaga",sport
"And yet Sevilla fell away, were knocked out of the Champions League by Leicester (whom they had overrun in the last-16 first leg), and it is true that by the end of the domestic season it was a familiar duo competing on the final day, as they had been all season, and there were few real shifts: the same top four, same next three and same bottom three all year",sport
"It is not Scotland in the sun but there are problems, even if the last couple of years have seen them mitigated a little, not as bad as it was six or seven seasons ago Spains other clubs cannot compete economically and are a long way off Premier League teams in that regard",sport
"England must be doing something right if clubs of the stature of Manchester United cannot always get their own way, and half a dozen potential title candidates is a lot healthier than the situation we used to have when the top four was set in stone and only Arsenal or Chelsea would take it in turns to challenge Uniteds dominance Yet though this has been a reasonably lively and absorbing contest at the top of the table the big six are not the whole storyBeneath the top six this season are Everton, seemingly stuck in a permanent no mans land between the achievers and those with relegation concerns, followed by a long gap and then Southampton in eighth place with 46 points",sport
The other part of the equation is the club adopting a more internationalist strategy,sport
"Bayerns dominance does drive international interest to the Bundesliga, and discovering the full picture often keeps people glued Even if the title race was a non-event this year, there was drama throughout the rest of the table, in terms of the European places and at the bottom On the seasons final day, almost half of the teams still had something to play for The success of Europe-bound Freiburg, and the struggles of giants such as Hamburg, show its not always about money correlating to successAttendances are reassuringly stable  this seasons slight dip should be wiped out in 2017-18 with modest Darmstadt and Ingolstadt relegated and replaced by the better-supported Stuttgart and Hannover",sport

"Then, Monaco had a freak season where they exceeded all expectations but deserved to win their first league title in 17 years",sport
"Bordeaux are going in the right direction under their bright manager, Jocelyn Gourvennec It will be fascinating to see Lilles progress under Marcelo Bielsa next season, and Srgio Conceio has worked wonders at Nantes since taking over in December",sport
"Overall, PSG have been the perfect driving force for Ligue 1, with the other historic clubs trying to catch them up The Parisians are still the richest and most powerful but Monaco showed this season that winning Ligue 1 is not a given any moreHas the leagues TV deal suffered? A little bit",sport

"Watzke added: We had a very, very good feeling about Bosz from the outset, the feeling that something can really grow together here",sport

"The independent panels preliminary report, which was leaked in March, was scathing about how an internal investigation led by the British Cycling board member Alex Russell had been handled The report, sent to the boards of British Cycling and UK Sport in December, accused Russells fellow directors of sanitising and even reserving her findings, which resulted in Sutton being found guilty of one relatively minor offence out of the nine with which he had been chargedA Freedom of Information Act request by Press Association Sport then revealed that UK Sport also had serious concerns about the boards treatment of Varnishs complaintSutton, who has always maintained his innocence, quit in April 2016, with the former chief executive Ian Drake leaving his post in January Since then British Cycling has appointed a new chairman in Jonathan Browning, brought in Julie Harrington from the Football Association as chief executive, hired a new human resources executive and revamped its code of conduct",sport

"Another rumour concerning Klopps side is all over the back pages of several papers this morning, who reflect widespread excitement about the impending conclusion to their pursuit of Romas Mohamed Salah, with all parties concerned on the verge of agreeing a 35m deal to take the Egyptian winger back to England Another much-mooted move that could be imminently completed is that of Tottenhams Kyle Walker to Manchester City, with the Star revealing that Etihad chiefs are confident of completing the move once Englands games with Scotland and France have taken placeIf only everything were so straightforward",sport
"Elsewhere there is plenty of news about transfers that are not going to happen Celtic, for example, will not entertain any offers for Moussa Dembl, at least unless they are eliminated from the Champions League in Augusts qualifying round, whereupon hes yours for 30m Also, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain is happy at Arsenal, Gareth Bale is even happier in Madrid, and Anthony Martials agent says there is no reason for him to leave Manchester unless Ed Woodward tells me they want him to leave which, just to clarify, he hasnt",sport
"What would have come of Swansea last season if they didnt have the one-man goal-and-assist-machine Gylfi Sigurdsson among their otherwise rank ranks? It is a question with only the miserable of answers, but thankfully for the Swans it is only speculation",sport
"Evertons pursuit of more goals from midfield might also be achieved by snaffling Leicesters own Riyad Mahrez, though the player would prefer Arsenal or Chelsea to sign him please, while Koeman  linked over the weekend with a move to replace the outgoing Romelu Lukaku with Jamie Vardy  has also identified a goalkeeper who would come cheaper than Sunderlands Jordan Pickford, in the shape of Gents Lovre KalinicThe Cavaliers put up a strong fight but still fell 132-113 in Game 2 of the NBA finals to the Golden State Warriors, a superteam who are starting to look  and this postseason literally are  unbeatable",sport
"The Cavaliers played significantly better than they did in the first game of the series, but a triple-double from LeBron James, 20 forced turnovers and 15 steals still werent enough to topple the best team in decades",sport
"Leading the Warriors effort  again  was Kevin Durant, with 33 points He did it all",sport
"But it should be remembered that the Cavaliers were 2-0 down at this stage last year, and they didnt take Sundays loss lying down Indeed, they were just three points down going into halftime",sport
"Its been a great run, but none of that matters unless we can finish the job, said the Warriors head coach, Steve Kerr Heading to Cleveland were gonna have to be a lot smarter If we play that game in Cleveland, were not winning",sport
"James carried the team on offense and defense, scoring 29 points and stealing the ball several times He even joined Magic Johnson and Jerry West as the only players to reach 300 career assists in the finals Kevin Love caught fire early, assisting James with 27 points and 7 rebounds",sport
"Liverpool are close to agreeing a 35m deal for Romas Mohamed Salah, with reports suggesting the Egypt winger could finalise a move to Anfield this week",sport
"Talks have been continuing between the parties for some time and Roma rejected an initial 28m bid from Liverpool a few days ago However, Jrgen Klopp is determined to acquire Salah and, with the player also believed to be keen on the switch, it appears an agreement is close to being reached following an increased bid from the MerseysidersShould the transfer happen it would be a case of second time lucky for Liverpool, who wanted Salah in 2014 only to see him move to Chelsea instead from the Swiss club Basel He struggled to make an impact at Stamford Bridge, however, and in 2015 moved to Italy, joining Fiorentina on loan before moving to Roma, also on loan, soon afterThat became a long-term move last August and Salah has subsequently flourished for the Giallorossi",sport
"Such is Liverpools determination to acquire Salah that they are willing to make him the joint most-expensive signing in their history, following on from the 35m spent on purchasing Andy Carroll from Newcastle United in January 2011 Salah is expected to earn in the region of 90,000 a week at AnfieldLiverpool have already signed one player in the close season  the England Under-20 striker Dominic Solanke, who will arrive on Merseyside on 1 July following the end of his contract with Chelsea  and, with the club having reached the Champions League qualifying stages, Klopp is determined to add to his resources between now and the first leg in AugustAs well as targeting Salah, the German is also believed to be keen on acquiring Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain from Arsenal, Naby Keita from Red Bull Leipzig and the Southampton defender Virgil van DijkGareth Bale has insisted that he has no intention of leaving Real Madrid this summer amid speculation that Manchester United may attempt to sign the Wales international for a fee of more than 100m",sport
Bale was a second-half substitute in his home city of Cardiff as Real became the first side to retain the status as European champions since the Champions League era began with a comprehensive 4-1 win against Juventus on SaturdayThat victory ensured Bale became the first Welshman to win club footballs most prestigious tournament for the third time at the end of a season during which the 27-year-old has been plagued by injuryBale made only 19 league appearances for the club as they won a first La Liga title since 2011,sport
"Ive signed a long-term contract at Madrid, he said",sport
"United tried to sign Bale in 2013 when David Moyes succeeded Sir Alex Ferguson at Old Trafford but were beaten to his signature The Welshmans representatives have dismissed reports linking him with a return to the Premier League, stressing that he has no desire to leave the most successful club in global football",sport
"Since John McEnroe turned the air blue in the 80s, memorably at decorous Wimbledon but without fear or favour across the tennis landscape, the sport has struggled to accommodate what it regards as unsportsmanlike conduct, as quaint a notion as unparliamentary behaviour at Westminster",sport
"There have been some classic outbursts in the first week of this French Open Nick Kyrgios brought his fines for the past 12 months to 25,000 with a racket smash during his exit at the hands of Kevin Anderson, and Novak Djokovic was soundly ticked off for gesturing to throw his racket at the umpire at a stressful moment in his tortured win against Diego Schwartzman on FridayAndy Murray internalises his angst, beating himself up verbally rather than abusing his racket, the ground or the ball kids",sport
"Enroute to the fourth round against the young Russian Karen Khachanov on Monday, Murray has chuntered, cursed, smiled and shushed  all in rhythm with his sense of comfort and the level of his play After a lot of shushing to himself and a few wicked glances towards his box in his tense win against Juan Martn del Potro on Saturday, he was happy to explain, perhaps for the first time in detail, what makes his verbal tics tick",sport
"I was still muttering a lot today, he said, maybe not so much at the beginning  but I was losing at the beginning I dont know how much of an impact it has on my tennis",sport
"I felt like when I was getting frustrated [on his way to defeating DelPotro 7-6, 7-5, 6-0] I stopped myself fairly quickly and got back to playing the right way",sport
"I wasnt playing well enough last week to win the tournament, he also admitted",sport
"And thats the beauty of Murray: it is impossible to predict which version of him will turn upBut which Khachanov will we get? Murray takes a walk into the relatively unknown at the beginning of the second week  against a boy named Karen (with the emphasis on the second syllable, he reminded us on Sunday), who played some tough tennis to get the better of John Isner over four sets in three hours on the claustrophobic court 2",sport
"The 21-year-old Russian has not quite lived up to the 2013 assessment of his compatriot, the former world No1 Yevgeny Kafelnikov, who said of him: He will be in the top 20 by the end of 2015",sport
"But, he said, he will not explode like his other hero, the eccentric Russian Marat Safin Khachanovs off-court obsession is chess, so there will be plenty of room for mind gamesThe British & Irish Lions management have called for a rethink on tour scheduling following their teams sluggish opening display on Saturday",sport
"There are also those who believe the Lions should reduce the amount of corporate and community work they do and allocate more time to their rugby The players, still struggling to shake off the effects of jet lag, spent Sunday morning in Waitangi, where they received a stirring Maori welcome before returning to Auckland to prepare for their second game of the tour, against the Blues onWednesdaySpencer, who said the squads thoughts and prayers were with the victims of the London Bridge terror attack, is hoping the Lions will be allocated a more helpful slot in the global timetable from 2021 onwardsWe have always been disappointed in the preparation time, the former England centre said It is arranged for us and we have to take our lot",sport
"However, Sam Warburton, the Lions captain, has acknowledged that his team need to play significantly better against the Blues and the Crusaders",sport
Ben Teo confirmed several Lions players were feeling the effects of jet lag before and during the match on Saturday,sport
"Here we are, four years later and still not much has changed The atmosphere of a siege still pervades Selwoods game and he consciously ignores every self-preserving impulse any normal person should have He ignored them again during the first quarter on Friday night at Simonds Stadium, when he had a tte--tte with Andy Ottens elbow",sport
"Selwood returned to the ground early in the second quarter with 12 stitches and another scar on the side of his head He doesnt need any more [scars], said his younger brother and teammate Scott after the Cats posted an impressive 22-point win against fellow Premiership hopefuls Adelaide He has got enough scars and he is ugly enough as it is",sport
"Hes also got enough Brownlow votes (without having won it), but will probably end up with three more after another best afield performance  21 contested possessions and nine clearances that continued the Crows sorry record at Simonds stadium, a venue at which theyve not won since 2003Selwoods game had been infused with iron long before he first walked through the door at Kardinia Park at the dawn of a Geelong era The comedian Jerry Lewis once confessed that he tried to get his father to show some emotion by offering him $50,000 to smack Lewis around",sport
"But despite his burgeoning trophy cabinet, Selwood has been the star who hasnt seemed to care much about being one",sport
"Week after week, the Geelong champion plays in a fearless style that brings into relief the plastic macho of those of us who write about football and question the mental toughness of playersWhat cannot be questioned is Selwoods hardness and his impact on the club where he has played all of his 239 games In an era where a players worth is increasingly defined by multi-year, multi-million contract offers, Selwood is a generational player who not only defines Geelongs most successful era, but personifies it And he has the scars to prove itThe Republic of Ireland secured a morale-boosting 3-1 win over Uruguay in a friendly match, with Jonathan Walters, Cyrus Christie and James McClean all finding the target in Dublin",sport
"Ireland had taken a 28th-minute lead through Walterss sumptuous effort and, although Jos Gimnez levelled before the break, Christies strike and a well-executed third from the substitute McClean rounded off a good evening for the manager, Martin ONeillHe made eight changes to the side who lost 3-1 against Mexico with only the goalkeeper, Darren Randolph, and the defenders Christie and Shane Duffy retained, and his big names engineered a significant improvement on the performance at the MetLife Stadium to boost spirits before Austrias visit to Dublin next Sunday for a World Cup qualifier",sport
"ONeills opposite number, scar Tabrez, named only five of the men who started Ururguays last World Cup qualifier in Peru, among them the Paris Saint-Germain frontman Edinson CavaniIn the event Cavani lasted 12 minutes before over-stretching in a vain attempt to reach Randolphs nonchalant pass across his own penalty area to Duffy at the start of a first half which was to move from the sublime to the ridiculous before it drew to a closeIrelands 4-2-3-1 formation gave them a more solid base than they had enjoyed against the Mexicans when ONeills three-man defence simply did not work but Robbie Brady found himself operating on the right and initially struggled to have his usual influence",sport
Walters enjoyed some early success in getting behind the Uruguay rearguard but it was Brady who tested Esteban Conde with a swerving 13th-minute effort before Duffy only just failed to connect with a diving header from the Burnley midfielders cross seconds later,sport
"Cavanis replacement, Cristhian Stuani, failed to trouble Randolph with a tame 18th-minute volley and the home side took the lead in some style 10 minutes laterGlenn Whelan surged on to Jeff Hendricks pass and stabbed the ball towards Walters who, having urged his team-mate to step aside, took a touch and then curled a dipping right-foot shot past Conde and into the far cornerUruguay were level seven minutes before the break when Gimnez made the most of Randolphs ill-judged decision to come for Egidio Arevalo Rios free-kick, although he needed a piece of good fortunate as the ball came off his shoulder as he attempted to head it and looped into the unguarded netHowever, Ireland would have gone in ahead at the break had Walters been able to summon up even a morsel of the quality he had demonstrated earlier when meeting Bradys volleyed cross in front of an open goal but he contrived to steer his shot against the crossbar from three yardsChristie did restore the advantage within six minutes of the restart, though, when he cut inside the full-back Martin Cceres and deceived Conde with a low left-foot shot which Sebastin Coates failed to block",sport
"With Brady now playing in his more accustomed left-sided berth, the Republic were more of a threat despite ONeill making five substitutions by the hour",sport
"One of them, Keiren Westwood, announced his return to the fold with a fine one-handed save from Gimenezs towering 68th-minute header but it was Ireland who finished the strongerDaryl Murphy tested Conde with a low drive and then set up his fellow substitute McClean to cement the win in clinical fashion McClean stepped on to Murphys pass, skipped over Gimnezs desperate lunge and thumped a shot across the keeper and inside the far postVirat Kohli hailed a massive win against Pakistan as India delivered the message that, for all the talk of issues behind the scenes in their camp, they are more than capable of defending their Champions Trophy title this summerKohli delivered a batting masterclass, with an unbeaten 81 from 68 balls as his side posted 319 for three in a rain-reduced 48 overs",sport
The middle order was outstanding and Yuvi was outstanding I felt like a club batter next to him,sport
"Yuvraj added: We started well with the bat and the bowlers came and stuck to the plan and took wickets at regular intervals India-Pakistan is very special - the Indian fans make it special for usMickey Arthur, Pakistans head coach, fronted up after the match, describing the result as a reality check for a side who are lowest ranked in the eight-team tournament while lamenting the two dropped catches that gave reprieves to Yuvraj and Kohli on eight and 43 respectivelyWe didnt take opportunities and they made us pay for it, Arthur said",sport
"Asked how long before performances improve, he replied: How long is a piece of string? I dont know Were trying every day",sport
"In the morning the International Cricket Council put out a press release confirming that the tournament would go on, just as the Ashes had after the London bombings in 2005",sport
"Besides, Indias openers took it especially slow and steady in the first few overs, so the latecomers did not miss anything much",sport
"Three are retired now, and the fourth, Akmal, was kicked out of the squad because he failed a fitness test This is a callow Pakistan team then, out-matched by an outstanding Indian side hardened by all those seasons of intense limited overs cricket in the Indian Premier League When the game started to escape the Pakistanis they were not able to regain any measure of control over it They ran flush out of luck too, which did not help Their bowling attack collapsed in the final overs as Mohammad Amir and Wahab Riaz had to leave the field, injured",sport
"At twenty past ten, almost exactly 12 hours after the attack in London, Edgbaston fell quiet in a minutes silence It was the only moment between dawn and dusk in which the streets around the ground were not loud with the sound of screams, shouts, whistles, horns and drums There was succour to be found in the crowd, in their determination to go on with the frivolous business of singing, dancing and cheering to celebrate sixes and wickets",sport
"The California Highway Patrol says neither Fisher nor his passenger, former Basketball Wives reality star Gloria Govan, were injured in the crash early on SundayAuthorities say Fisher was driving on US 101 in the Sherman Oaks area of Los Angeles when his 2015 Cadillac veered onto the right shoulder while approaching an interchange",sport
"The Highway Patrol says officers discovered that Fisher had been drinking and he was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence of alcoholIndia are up and running in the defence of their Champions Trophy title following a brutal exhibition of ball-striking from Virat Kohli and Yuvraj Singh that, on the ground where they lifted the trophy four years ago, simply crushed their arch-rivals PakistanBut while the result  a 124-run win by Duckworth-Lewis  may have met pre-match expectations in terms of the current gulf between the two sides, the atmosphere at least exceeded them as a record crowd of 24,165 throbbed throughout a day that required patience given its regular stoppages for rain",sport
"This was a match strewn with errors, perhaps because of the magnitude of the occasion given a global TV audience tipped to approach one billion, but at least it ended with the brollies packed away and the ground bathed in glorious sunshine Pakistan, faced with an ever-increasing run-rate, were bowled out for 164 in 334 overs with the No11, Wahab Riaz, failing to emerge due to injury Umesh Yadav led the Indian attack with three for 30Sarfraz Ahmeds side had been chasing a rain-adjusted target of 289 from 41 overs but always looked up against it after India had stuck 319 for three on the board in 48",sport
"Despite Pakistans head coach, Mickey Arthur, talking up their preparation leading into the match, his side were shabbier in the field than some of the items for sale in the nearby Moseley vintage fair and, though the two rain breaks that wiped out 75 minutes of play gave them a couple of chances to regroup, they instead got progressively worse By the end, when Kohli and Yuvraj were clubbing boundaries for fun, the wheels were off completely",sport
Sharmas 91 from 119 balls was an old-style affair from the owner of the world record ODI score of 264,sport
"Sharmas eventual demise came to the surprise of many A seemingly innocuous run-out attempt from point ended with the bat over the line but pushed up by the dive such that the third umpire, Richard Kettleborough, judged it not to be groundedWith 10 overs of to go and Yuvraj new to the crease, the score was 202 for two and Pakistan were still in it provided they could apply the squeeze But instead two regulation drops handed lives to both batsmen and, with Amir and Wahab succumbing to cramp and an ankle problem respectively, 117 runs were flayed, including an astonishing 72 from the last 24 deliveriesYuvraj was first to profit in the 39th over when, with eight to his name, he duffed a googly from Shadab to Hasan Ali at long-on only to see the ball grassed on the slide",sport
"Pakistans reply, with an original adjusted target of 324 cut after a 35-minute rain break early on, hinged on Azhar converting his 64-ball half-century into an innings of substance and given support at the other end Neither materialised, with Ahmed Shehzad trapped lbw for 12 by Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Babar Azam slashing Yadav to point on eight before Azhar himself swept Ravindra Jadeja to deep square-leg the ball after reaching his 50",sport
Castleford took another step towards finally securing the title after almost a century of trying with a narrow home victory against St Helens The win was notable also for the fact that they were without a number of key front-line players,sport
"Daryl Powell, the Tigers head coach, made no secret of how, with this third game of a gruelling 10-day period, he would rest several big names to not only make a point to the sports schedulers but also to ensure that his Castleford players do not burn out in the long term",sport
"Powell was without more than 1,000 games worth of Super League experience , with England internationals such as Luke Gale, Zak Hardaker and Michael Shenton all missing And while they have already beaten some of their opponents with remarkable free-flowing rugby on many occasions this season, given the circumstances this win surely ranks as their best of the year so farThe added bonus for Castleford was that with Salford Red Devils losing at home against Wakefield, it extended the their own lead at the top of the Super League table to four points Its one of the biggest wins Ive been involved in, honestly, Powell said We cant get carried away with having a buffer at the top but weve got something special going here",sport
"St Helens had a 10-day turnaround for this game: another bone of contention for Powell pre-match given that his side played as recently as last Monday Yet despite two earlier encouraging performances under their new coach, Justin Holbrook, the 12-4 half-time lead they established was eventually overturned with Tom Holmess late try nine minutes from time to inflict a first defeat on the Australian as coach",sport
"Its a missed opportunity, Holbrook said later",sport
"Tries Gill, McMeeken, Holmes",sport
"Tries Percival, McCarthy-Scarsbrook",sport
Steven Finns summons to the Champions Trophy squad was confirmed on Sunday and he was understandably delighted that he has been chosen to replace Chris Woakes But being a conscientious student of the game he must be aware that he has not been invited to a picnic for bowlers,sport
So far it has been a batsmans tournament between the exasperating showers,sport
"Finn made his one-day international debut six years ago; has 69 matches under his belt and he was in Englands Champions Trophy squad in 2013 when he played one game against South AfricaIts great to be here, Finn said on arrival at a damp Cardiff It is obviously very sad for Chris Woakes, who is a good friend of mine, but Im glad I have got the call",sport
"Off the field Finn is a mild-mannered, contemplative man (on it he is no Dennis Lillee) but he is prepared to outline what he brings to the squad",sport
He has seldom been regarded as a miserly bowler yet his economy rate compares well with those of his peers (in fact it is much better than that of any other bowler in the squad) but that is partly explained by his longevity  there has been hyper-inflation in run-scoring over the past 18 months,sport
"Whether that person is Novak Djokovic was difficult to say after another win that mixed waywardness with brilliance on Sunday eveningThe defending champion, who also looked lost at various points over five sets against Diego Schwartzman on Friday, has hardly had a sound preparation for a likely semi-final against Nadal, the rival who has won the title here nine times",sport
"When Nadal won his seventh championship in 2012, he gave up only 19 games on his way to the last eight On Sunday he raced into the quarters ahead of the field in a mere 1hr51min, dismissing another Spaniard, Roberto Bautista Agut, 6-1, 6-2, 6-2",sport
"Ena Sharples had fewer numbers against her trying to win Friday-night bingo than Busta has against Nadal but after defeating Raonic 4-6, 7-6, 6-7, 6-4, 8-6 he insisted: Maybe Ill lose easy, maybe Ill win easyThose two maybes are about as far apart as the players professional records",sport
"Probably I didnt play as well as I did the other day, he said later, which is not as arrogant as it sounds I made a few mistakes but not important ones In general terms I played well",sport
The most important thing for me is I was able to play with no injuries and not too many problems since [Carlos Moy joined his team] We have been able to practise as much as we wanted and the way that we wanted,sport
"There have been suggestions that his uncle, Toni  who will give up his main coaching role at the end of the year  admonished Nadal at the start of the season for what he perceived to be a lack of motivation",sport
"What is obvious is that Busta, who has had a decent season and a solid tournament, will find this match tougher than any of their previous three, all of which he lost",sport
"If I didnt think I had a chance, I would not play Of course it will be difficult because Rafa is the best player on the surface in history I am maybe tired but I have one day off We will see on Tuesday Hes a really good friend",sport
The short odds are that it will be a special occasion for Busta but not a match that will change his career Nadal told Spanish journalists: I fully respect each opponent and I fully respect the tournament Just because things go well for you it does not mean things are going to continue like this You have to be ready so that you can react to bad moments that might happenA tearful Garbie Muguruza hit out at the crowd after her title defence was ended by Frances Kristina Mladenovic,sport
"Along with intense disappointment, there was also relief for the Spaniard, who has struggled to cope with the expectation since her triumph here last year",sport
"Mladenovic, though, praised her supporters The courage and the force you give me is just unimaginable Its thanks to you that I fought for every point And were in the quarter-finals Yes!She has been struggling with a bad back since the eve of the tournament and served 16 double faults, but the rest of her game made up for it",sport
"Venus Williams, Svetlana Kuznetsova and Sam Stosur also went out, meaning the womens event will have a first-time champion this yearWilliams, who had been hoping to win the tournament for the first time in the month of her 37th birthday and add to her seven grand slam titles, lost 5-7, 6-2, 6-1 to Timea Bacsinszky, the second year in a row the Swiss has beaten her in the fourth round",sport
"I think she just played really well, Williams said She had so many answers today I just give her credit for playing well every point, even in the first set",sport
"Caroline Wozniacki, with two grand slam final appearances to her credit the most experienced player left, continued her fine year with a surprise 6-1, 4-6, 6-2 victory over the 2009 champion Kuznetsova Despite facing an opponent proficient on clay, which is not the Danes best surface, Wozniacki showed unexpected aggression on her forehand, matching her opponents tally of 26 winners Kuznetsova did not help her cause with 41 unforced errors Wozniacki next faces the Latvian teenager Jelena Ostapenko, who knocked out Stosur 2-6, 6-2, 6-4 to reach her first quarter-finalFour third-round matches were carried over from Saturday, and the top-five seeds Karolina Pliskova and Elina Svitolina went through",sport
"He played the entire first half and the final 17 minutes of the second and in that time the clubs all-time leading goalscorer, who has fallen out of favour with the manager, Jos Mourinho, and appears destined to leave this summer, lobbed one early effort on to the roof of the netWhile Rooney could be excused to some degree, having flown back from a family holiday in Barbados to play in the friendly, it was perhaps indicative of his current situation that he did not particularly stand out in the company of a host of long-retired former professionals At the final whistle he gave a quick wave to fans before heading down the tunnel",sport
"Carrick, who saw a deft first-half chip drift wide of the angle of crossbar and post, scored the equaliser in a 2-2 draw draw eight minutes from time before departing to a standing ovation",sport
Despite more than a decade at United the pre-match team sheet somehow managed to spell the main mans name wrong  he was originally listed as Carrtick before the error was quickly corrected,sport
"A number of victims families were in the Old Trafford crowd, as were about 300 members of the emergency services who dealt with the aftermath of the atrocityObviously this game has extra significance in the wake of what has happened in the last two weeks, said Carrick, who laid floral tributes before a minutes silence for victims of both attacks",sport
Id like to extend my condolences to those affected by the events in Manchester and also those in London My heart goes out to all those affected and my message is stay together and stay strong,sport
On my behalf Id like to welcome some of the families of the victims,sport
I have to thank the fans for their support,sport

The 31-year-old rock climber is the first to achieve the feat and indeed was regarded as the only climber capable of attempting it,sport
"After completing the climb, Honnold tweeted: So stoked to realize a life dream today, including a photo of himself ascending along a wide crack near the top of the routeThis is the moon landing of free-soloing, fellow climber Tommy Caldwell told National Geographic, which filmed the ascent for a documentary and first carried the news on its website",sport
"Caldwell won fame outside the climbing world for his 2015 ascent with Kevin Jorgeson of El Capitans Dawn Wall route, setting a new standard of difficulty on the Yosemite valley cliffFree-soloing is the practice of climbing without a harness or rope, leaving zero margin for error The route Honnold climbed, known as Freerider, is 2,900ft tall and near the top of the ratings system for difficulty, at 5",sport
"Honnolds preparation for the exploit was the subject of rumor even as it was written off as impossibly daunting and risky The Sacramento native, who has repeatedly shocked the climbing world with ropeless ascents of forbidding routes, had been discreetly training for the route for more than a year",sport
"Honnold backed off of an earlier attempt at a free-solo, last November, after judging conditions to be suboptimal He most recently climbed the route with a rope, and Caldwell as partner, on a Monday late last monthAlex was on fire, Caldwell told National Geographic of the ascent",sport
"Years ago, when I first mentally mapped out what it would mean to free-solo Freerider, there were half a dozen of pitches where I was like: Oh, thats a scary move and thats a really scary sequence, and that little slab, and that traverse, Honnold told National Geographic",sport
There were so many little sections where I thought Ugh  cringe,sport
"The route was first ascended by a climber pulling only on stone  as opposed to pulling on gear drilled or cantilevered into the stone  in 1995, by the German climber Alex Huber",sport

"A former team-mate barely remembers him saying a word, describing him as shy, which is just one of the reasons why his success is unexpected Even as assistant players did not see it, one member of the side who won in Lisbon admits",sport

"The France forward, 26, had been heavily linked with a potential world-record transfer to Manchester United, but any such move is off after the court of arbitration for sport last week upheld a ban on the club registering new players in this transfer windowSpeaking on Sunday morning during the French television programme Telefoot, Griezmann said: The ruling of the CAS has come through",sport
"Atltico, along with their city rivals Real Madrid, were handed two-window transfer bans in January 2016 for multiple breaches of global footballs rules on the registration of under-18s and both clubs failed in their appeals to Fifa last SeptemberThe two Spanish giants then took their cases to the CAS but, while Reals ban was halved to one transfer window in December, Atltico announced on Thursday that the only reduction they had been given was regarding their financial penalty  down from 720,000 to 440,000",sport
"That leaves them unable to sign new players until the January window, ending the clubs bid to bring in the Lyon striker Alexandre Lacazette, who was seen as a likely replacement for Griezmann",sport
"Griezmann, who has a release clause in his contract set at 100m(87m), scored 26 goals in 53 appearances for Atltico this past seasonA test opening of St Petersburgs Zenit Arena in February treated 10,000 spectators to car racing, motorcycle tricks, dancers and a performing bear introduced as Russias greatest hero But the patriotic ceremony failed to note that the stadium, in which Russia kick off the Confederations Cup in a fortnight in preparation for next years World Cup, was built mostly by immigrant workers from Asia, including from one of the worlds most repressive countries, North Korea",sport
"A subcontractor who asked to remain anonymous said at least 190 downtrodden North Koreans had worked long hours with no days off between August and November last year and that one, a 47-year-old, had died on site These guys are afraid to speak to people They dont look at anyone",sport
"The St Petersburg construction committee said the authorities had conducted regular inspections to make sure conditions at the Zenit Arena site met Russian labour laws But according to the subcontractor, North Koreans at the site worked at least 11 hours a day for $10-$15, seven days a week They not only earned less than other migrant workers but lived in more cramped conditions, six to eight workers sharing one construction caravanThe North Korean had died from a heart attack, the subcontractor said He added that fatigue was a danger",sport
"While Russias World Cup preparations have not had the same number of fatalities as those for the 2022 competition in Qatar, where hundreds of migrant workers have been killed during a huge construction boom, the Observer found in 2015 that at least five workers had died in accidents at the Zenit Arena",sport
"Allegations of exploitation of North Korean workers are only the latest chapter in the spotted history of the Zenit Arena When St Petersburg started planning a new stadium in 2006 for Zenit, the project was scheduled to finish by the end of 2008 and cost 67bn roubles (92m at todays exchange rate)",sport
"Despite the huge spending, Fifa reportedly found last year that the Zenit Arenas removable pitch did not meet its shock absorption standards Vladimir Putin is said to have told Fifas president, Gianni Infantino, that the stadiums scandal-ridden construction was a very sad story and promised that all defects would be fixed After the city fired the general contractor last July over delays and cost overruns, the vice-governor Albin managed to gather more than 4,000 workers at the site for a final push to finish it",sport
"Last year the two governments signed a treaty to extradite citizens who illegally enter either country, an agreement condemned by the UN as a mechanism to send North Korean workers who seek asylum back to face torture or death But only a handful have sought asylum",sport
"Trush has been housing construction workers on and off for the past five years She said the North Koreans typically worked like ants, starting at 8am and ending at 11pm",sport
"Malsar Khuseinov, the director of Soyuz-Stroi, a construction company that employs 200 North Koreans, said workers were allowed to extend the work day as much as they need to meet a deadline",sport
"On a recent night in the suburb of Shushary, this reporter found a two-storey, metal-sided dormitory where North Korean workers live in a large cluster of similar housing A man preparing food in the small, low kitchen immediately made a call on his cellphone and within minutes a well-dressed man who gave his name only as Choi arrived He said he was a translator for the North Korean state company that brings workers to Russia",sport
"Thirty-two men lived in the Shushary dormitory, he said, and another 100 were working in the suburb of Pargolovo A North Korean fell to his death from a nine-storey building there in June, Choi confirmed",sport
"Nearby, a group of North Korean workers were still pouring concrete on the 22nd storey of a residential tower at 10",sport
"Asked how much he made, he also said 50,000 to 60,000 roubles a month The conversation was cut short by security guards who briefly detained this reporter in a construction trailerThe Norwegian football magazine Josimar recently found another group of about 100 North Koreans who were living in construction caravans and working long hours at another Dalpiterstroi site, surrounded by barbed wire and guards with dogsIn reality, the workers are likely to make far less than the figures they cite as the Pyongyang regime takes 30%-50% of their income, according to Andrei Lankov, a North Korea expert Nevertheless, working abroad was one of the few ways for North Koreans to improve their financial situation, he added",sport
"While there are many exceptions to the standard 40-hour week stipulated in Russias labour code, working at least 10 hours a day for most of five years, like the North Koreans said they do, would violate the law, two lawyers told this newspaper",sport
"Last week it emerged that Infantino had admitted that Fifa was aware of the issues In a letter dated 22 May to Nordic FA presidents who had raised the issue, he said: Fifa is aware of and firmly condemns the often appalling labour conditions under which North Korean workers are employed in various countries around the world He acknowledged that an inspection team for Fifas decent work monitoring system, set up to address concerns about human rights abuses, did find strong evidence for the presence of North Korean workers on the construction site in St Petersburg on a visit in November The issues found were subsequently raised with the respective company and with the general contractor, Infantino wrote Fifa said a further inspection in March found no more North Koreans working at the site",sport
"According to Svetlana Gannushkina, a veteran migrant rights activist who helps North Korean refugees, the authorities rarely raise any questions about these workers The rights of people working on our territory should be respected, no matter who their overlords are, but this isnt done, she said Its an area of complete lawlessness",sport
"Gianluigi Buffon stood with his hands on his hips, staring vacantly into the distance and not moving for what felt like an age Behind him the Real Madrid supporters were raucously celebrating their third goal and their second in the space of three minutes, flooring Juventus and leaving Buffon looking like a man who knew that the dream was over long before the clock had ticked down",sport
"This was anything but the perfect finale Buffon had talked about 24 hours earlier, when the 39-year-old expressed his hope that he would get his hands on the only major trophy to elude him in a distinguished career that has spanned three decades Buffon has won eight Serie A titles, a World Cup in 2006 and represented Italy 168 times, yet there is no Champions League winners medal in his trophy cabinet and, realistically, probably never will beIt was an evening that brought with it an uncomfortable sense of deja vu for Buffon and Juventus, who have now lost seven of their nine European Cup finals and could be forgiven for fearing the worst whenever they get to this stage of the competition",sport
In one respect Buffon was proved right,sport
"What a transformation from the opening 45 minutes, when Juventus took the game to Madrid, attacking with conviction and scoring a goal worthy of winning the Champions League, let alone merely equalising in a final",sport
"Unfortunately for Mario Mandzukic, the spectacular overhead kick that he speared beyond Keylor Navas, the Madrid keeper, at the end of a lovely move involving Gonzalo Higuan and Alex Sandro, brought only ephemeral joy Juventus could not sustain that high-tempo approach after the intervalPaulo Dybala, who scored twice in the quarter-final win over Barcelona and is so highly regarded, never imposed himself on the game and was withdrawn",sport
"Higuan, other than the assist for Mandzukics goal, carried little threat, while the influence of Sami Khedira and Miralem Pjanic, who was also substituted in the second half after picking up an injury, started to waneThe sight of Juan Cuadrado receiving a red card in the 84th minute for a second bookable offence rather summed up the second half It was a poor decision from the officials, with Sergio Ramos not for the first time in his career guilty of play-acting, yet by that stage everything Juventus tried to do seemed to be going wrong",sport
The solid defensive base on which this Champions League campaign has been built evaporated Juventus conceded more times in 90 minutes against Madrid than they did in the previous 12 matches in the competition put together as the Old Ladys experienced back-line started to look their age,sport
"It was impossible not to feel some sympathy for Buffon, who trudged across with the rest of the players to applaud the Juventus supporters that had stayed behind as Sergio Ramos hoisted the European Cup into the Cardiff sky Buffon has been an extraordinary servant to Juve, the club he joined for a world record 51m in 2001 to replace Edwin van der Sar, and it will be a strange day when someone else is wearing that No1 jersey for the club that have dominated Italian football for the past six seasonsIt feels like he has been around forever",sport
"Although Massimiliano Allegri left the door open to the possibility of Buffon trying again next season, with the Juventus manager refusing to accept the idea that several players in his team have reached the end of a cycle and that it is time to usher in a new era, age and history appear to be against the Italian goalkeeper Perhaps that was going through his mind when he stood alone on his penalty area after Madrids third goal",sport

"However, the preference for Ball rather than Rashid probably reflected a greater lack of faith in the fitness of some of Englands bowlers, which was subsequently justified",sport
"Perhaps there has been an element of wish fulfilment in Englands assessment of the fitness of Stokes and Woakes They are Englands engine room, two all-rounders near their peak; vital players long since inked into the best side",sport
"Against better attacks than that of Bangladesh, England might need a full quota of batsmen as well as the bowlers most likely to conjure up some wickets on true tracks In tournament cricket the short-term goals prevail; showing the faith and being consistent by backing your chosen men has to give way to picking the bloke likely to score the most runs at some point",sport
"Still, England produced a rather better performance than when they last encountered Bangladesh in an ICC tournament in Adelaide (defeat by 15 runs and an early flight home in 2015) It will be trickier in Cardiff on Tuesday against the Kiwis",sport
"New Zealand always seem undaunted when playing against their noisy neighbours and they are unlikely to be overawed by the prospect of facing England Against Australia, they tossed in Luke Ronchi, a wildcard, as an opening batsman; Kane Williamson became the tournaments second centurion after Joe Root  the cream is already coming to the surface  and in a brief period in the field their trio of pace bowlers demonstrated the benefits of bowling with genuine hostility at the start They are not compromising their modern, aggressive approach",sport

"ODriscoll gave a press conference early the next morning I dont possess the equanimity to take a pounding like that and say nothing, to put it down as part of the game Because it isnt, he wrote",sport
"Thomas took over as captain He felt the Lions were being derided as a bunch of spineless whingers, and that Woodwards decision to bring along a refereeing consultant and a legal adviser had spawned accusations of arrogance Campbell had put up a war wall of negative cuttings to motivate the players But after three days there the wall was overflowing and was taken down Under all the pressure, Thomas was worried the natural cracks and fissures were starting to show",sport

"Knowing Sexton as he does, Murray also expects plenty of straight talking on the training pitch as the tour progresses I was talking to Dan about it All three fly-halves are pretty fiery and really competitive Youve three guys there that want to win all the time and if standards arent upheld they will let it be known theyre not happy It will be interesting to see what happens",sport

"The call-up means Finn, who has 102 wickets from 69 one-day caps and reached the heights of No2 in the world rankings back in 2012, has seen off the challenge of his Middlesex team-mate Toby Roland Jones and Surreys Tom Curran and could come straight into the side to face New Zealand in Cardiff on Tuesday  where victory would seal a semi-final placeAdil Rashid, the leg-spinner who was dropped for the Bangladesh match, and the left-armer David Willey represent Englands other bowling options but whoever gets the nod in the final XI, Woakes will certainly be missed as a go-to man for Morgan at the end of an innings",sport

"But Lyth, whose next highest score this season is 30, had chiselled Yorkshire towards Roses dominance: a first innings lead of 150, which their potent seam attack then capitalised on, dismissing Lancashires top four cheaply In their way stand Shiv Chanderpaul and Dane Vilas, who shared a sprightly 60 late in the day",sport
"A measure of Lyths inningss quality is that the only other batsman to pass 40 is Chanderpaul Lyth played totally against type for a man normally stylish and gallivanting With Lancashires bowling  all 82 overs were delivered by seamers  never easy to get away due to a defensive line and the favourable conditions, care was required and Lyth obliged Lancashire badly missed Jimmy Anderson, but he emerged at stumps to do some sprints, and England are increasingly optimistic he will be fit for the summers first TestYorkshire lost Gary Ballance, his 600th run of the season ticked off, to Ryan McLaren in a funereal morning but, with lunch approaching, Saqib Mahmood, the pick of the bowlers, found two wickets in two balls  Jack Leaning caught brilliantly at second slip and Tim Bresnan nicking to first",sport

"To their credit, the Warriors improved immensely after half-time but by then they were 26-4 down and the damage had been done, a point not lost on Wane afterwardsWe just left ourselves with too much to do in the second half, he said",sport
"Wigans opening half was perhaps summed up by a moment of madness from the forward Willie Isa, who tripped Mark Minichiello to concede a penalty that Jake Connor kicked with ease to open up that 22-point lead at the intervalPerhaps the one crumb of comfort for Wigan in that half was that they survived a 10-minute period without Liam Farrell relatively unscathed, after the England international was sent to the sin-bin for dissent After half-time they were much improved, and by the hour they had reduced the gap to 12 courtesy of tries from Liam Marshall and Lewis Tierney",sport
"With Wigan on top, it would need something special to quell any hope of a comeback, and the Hull full-back Jamie Shaul provided it with an instinctive chip, chase and regather to end Wigans revival before Albert Kelly secured victory with a long-range effort Late tries from Marshall, Tom Davies and Joe Burgess were mere consolations for a side already well beaten",sport

"There were echoes of Pour Mois charge through the field to victory in 2011 as his son Wings Of Eagles passed horse after horse in the Epsom straight, building momentum all the time and closing steadily on the leaders Two furlongs out, though, most eyes were glued to his stable companion, Cliffs Of Moher, and OBriens principal jockey Ryan Moore, as they glided past market rival Cracksman and into a useful lead",sport
"The stage was set for Cliffs Of Moher to stride clear but he simply stayed on without quickening as the race reached its climax, as Wings Of Eagles and Beggy chased them down and claimed victory by three-quarters of a lengthBefore the race, some might have questioned OBriens apparent wish to run almost every three-year-old colt with a pulse in Saturdays Classic A few minutes later, the wisdom of covering every possible base was unarguable, as Wings Of Eagles fulfilled the promise in his pedigree, which has the family of the 1995 Derby winner Lammtarra on his dams side to complement Pour MoiThis was OBriens fourth Derby success in the last six years and his sixth in all, one more than Sir Michael Stoutes (current) total of five between 1981 and 2010, and just one behind the all-time record of seven wins in the Classic All three of the trainers to saddle seven winners  Robert Robson, John Porter and Fred Darling  were active in a much less competitive era, and sent out their final Derby winners in 1823, 1899 and 1941 respectively",sport
"The trainer made it clear that Wings Of Eagles had been seen as a possible winner beforehand, despite his starting price and a defeat at the hands of Venice Beach, who finished 12th, on his previous start at Chester That said, he may still suspect that Cliffs Of Moher will prove to be a better horse in the long term",sport
"He was working very well and we were delighted with him at Chester, OBrien said Padraig was always going to take his time on him and produce him and he gave him a marvellous ride",sport
"He added of Cliffs Of Moher: I was delighted with the second horse All those really well-bred, good-looking horses, they can make dramatic improvement from race to race, and we knew that they had all improved [from their trial runs]I didnt really know what was going to happen I thought Ryans horse was open to the most improvement, which he was and he did, but Ryan said he got there and he just got tired in his hands I was half-afraid that that could happen, but wed just about made the race",sport

"Andy, hes very smart on court He has all the shots, but also is great mentally Thats why hes No1 in the world and I know how important this tournament is for him",sport
"The second frame was just as intense but Murray gradually got the upper hand over Del Potro, who had to take painkillers for a groin strain he picked up in his match against Nicols Almagro two days before He did not use that as an excuse and said he played pain free, but it was clear he was not moving as well as he might have wishedPartly that was down to what he identified as Murrays court intelligence There were so many artful exchanges between these two wonderful players that it was difficult to pick when the winning shot would arrive Murray concentrated on keeping as many balls away from his opponents lethal forehand as he could, then, having peppered him on the other flank, used the open court to tease him with drop shots",sport

"Yet the idea long pre-dates Sacchi Contes Chelsea have become the first side to win the league title using a back three as their default formation since Everton in 1962-63, and they have become adept at playing that system by using another English innovation of the early sixties, one developed by the Burnley, Sunderland and Sheffield Wednesday manager Alan BrownBorn in Corbridge in Northumberland, Brown soon demonstrated an ascetic streak Aged 16, he ran 17 miles along the Tyne into Newcastle, rested for a few minutes and then ran back, part of an effort to improve his fitness as he prepared for life as a professional footballer As a centre-half for Huddersfield, Burnley and Notts County, he developed a reputation for toughness and honesty",sport
"Brown also set up a restaurant in Burnley as his playing career was coming to an end and worked briefly as a policeman before being named the Burnely manager in 1954 There he established a strong youth set-up, and oversaw the development of a training complex on the edge of town, helping with much of the physical work himself, and insisting his players also did their share",sport
"You lived in fear of him but there was no need to be because he was a really genuine, nice guy, said Jimmy Nelson, a left-back who played for him at Sunderland He kept a very strict ship Wed go down to Seaburn beach and wed be training in skins in January  I dont think bibs had been invented then",sport
"Long before Pep Guardiola at Barcelona, he was an advocate of what are now known as rondos (a pig-in-the-middle game passing the ball past defenders in a circle) as a way of improving the maintenance of possession Long before they were common Brown insisted on warm-ups, explaining how they could be conducted in the dressing room if it were impossible to use the pitch A rhyme, he said, could be chanted during warm-ups to maintain rhythm and help morale: When I was a laddie I lived with me Grannie and many a hiding me Grannie gae me, but noo am a mannie, I hammer me Grannie  it serves her right for hammering me",sport
"Brown also developed an early, slightly less complex form of what Guardiola calls juego de posicin Imagining a team playing 4-2-4, he paired up the left-winger with the right-sided centre-back, the left-sided centre-forward with the right-back and vice-versa When one of those players had the ball, he encouraged his partner to move into midfield to offer an option for a short pass, his place then being taken by the nearest player to him in the same line, whose own place would then be taken by one of the two midfielders, creating a triangular flow of movement that would disrupt opposing marking systems while always maintaining that basic 4-2-4 shapeA scheme like that, though, could only work if players were already comfortable in their shape  which is where shadow play comes inUnlike Sacchi, Brown would use a ball, but the principle is the same  playing against nobody to get the movement and the shape right",sport

There have been many moments already this season to suggest Leeds and Warrington are on different paths  this was perhaps the most conclusive of them all,sport
"Warrington, who remain in the top eight, had started to piece their season together of late but this felt like a major step backwards They actually dominated possession early in the contest but came away with nothing to show for it  and Leeds ultimately made them payBy half-time the Rhinos were 12-0 ahead when tries from Parcell  who finished with a hat-trick  and Liam Sutcliffe put Leeds in control Any suggestion of a Warrington fightback was quelled with Parcells second shortly after the break, and from there, Leeds began to cut looseThere were four more tries  including the one which completed Parcells hat-trick late on",sport

"Northampton have done next to nothing the easy way all season so perhaps their circuitous route into next seasons Champions Cup should not come as a surprise But they can take enormous credit for the resilience shown to cap an exhilarating victory over Stade Franais thanks to Ahsee Tualas dramatic late try and Harry Mallinders nerveless conversionWhen Tuala went over, Northampton were down to 13  the captain Tom Wood had been sent off for a stamp to the head of Djibril Camara that may well rule him out of Englands tour to Argentina  while Rory Hutchinson was in the sin-bin",sport
"Considering it has been a season punctuated by deflating late defeats, this was a victory that undoubtedly went against the grain More significantly for Jim Mallinder, it means a ninth straight season in Europes premier competition thanks to the icy veins of his 20-year-old son Hes been doing that in the back garden for a long time, said Mallinder",sport
"With the magnificent Will Genia pulling the strings, Stade Franais were 10-0 up after seven minutes A swashbuckling try from Waisea Nayacalevu came when Genia sparked a move from a scrum on the right that finished with his Fijian winger over under the posts Jules Plisson converted and added a penalty and the pace of the match was unrelenting",sport
"Stade had their second try after a quick tap caught Saints cold to put Jrmy Sinzelle over on the left and head first into the crowd  the majority of whom had already taken a disliking to a number of the decisions by the referee, John Lacey",sport
"Saints registered another penalty through Mallinder but Stade appeared to be out of sight by half-time Louis Picamoles knocked on near his own line and from the resulting scrum Genia fed Camara, who ghosted over Mallinder then missed a shot at goal before better results with another after Plisson caught North with a high forearm that might have led to further punishment",sport
"Saints were given a lifeline when the Stade hooker, Remi Bonfils, was shown a yellow card for a trip on Mallinder in full flow but after a kick to the corner, another knock-on, this time from Hartley, stopped Saints in their tracks Stade could hold out for only a couple more minutes, however, Northampton eventually claiming some reward for chipping away and keeping hold of the ball as Ben Foden went over under the posts",sport
"And then  well, it depends on our hero Icarus fell straight into the sea, but Danny Cipriani came again As he prepares to step out at Twickenham for Wasps first tilt at the Premiership title since the final days of the Lawrence Dallaglio era in 2008, he is better than ever, more measured, more in tune with those around him, more of a fly-half",sport
"I probably understand the game a lot better now, he says I feel like Ive got a better brain for it as a fly-half",sport
"In his first season, which culminated in a second Heineken Cup win for that generation, in 2007, the No10 shirt was the long-held property of Alex King, that most consummate of fly-halfs, so Cipriani played most of the season as a brilliant counterattacking full-back But even when he assumed Kings shirt after the latters departure the following season, he continued to burnish his reputation with brilliance in the outside channels Wasps policy was to withdraw him from the frontline when they were defending, and when turnover ball was whipped wide there he was to exploit disjointed opponents with acceleration that was superior to most of the best wingersWhen Wasps won the last of their titles, in 2008, he was voted the players player of the season He had won man of the match on his England debut too",sport
"For he chose as his next stop Sale and a mentor in Steve Diamond, as earthy as Cipriani had been flamboyant My learning curve was really at Sale, he acknowledges, becoming a traditional fly-half but still learning how to manipulate defences",sport
"He played some of the best rugby of his career in the four years that followed, less the individual showman, more the master puppeteer His defence improved, as did his goalkicking On form alone he should have made Englands World Cup squad in 2015, but the dynamic had shifted",sport

"Ardley was determined to make the most of every small advantage he could to ensure his players were ready for their semi-final against Accrington Stanley By us making sure we had secured our play-offs place with one game remaining, it allowed me to freshen up the squad as they were at that point where they were just starting to feel the pinch after a heavy schedule of something like seven games in a month Accrington had to go hard into the last game as they were so close to securing automatic promotion Then all of a sudden they had the mental torture of not making it because of Bristol Rovers last-minute goal and then they have to play us, flogging the same team without a break So we also had a physical edge as well as a mental one",sport
"AFC Wimbledon were at home for the first leg of the semi-final, which they won 1-0 thanks to a 94th-minute goal from Tom Beere They had delivered yet another psychological blow to Accrington Stanley Before the second leg, Ardley told his players not to worry if they fell behind as their superior fitness would count Sure enough, the Dons found themselves 2-0 down after an hour and facing elimination But they did not buckle",sport

"The eminent philosopher and sports fan David Papineau, who teaches at Kings College London and New Yorks City University, writes interestingly about the yips in his new book Knowing the Score, subtitled How Sport Teaches Us About Philosophy (And Philosophy About Sport) The yips, he writes, are the sporting equivalent of a cancer that cannot be cured but only placed in remission According to his analysis, my efforts in the nets were worse than wasted No good can come from self-consciousness about your technique By turning your mind towards the components of your skills, you reduce yourself to the level of a beginner who is trying to play by numbers",sport

"It was hard to avoid the conclusion that Brewster and Latibeaudiere were undermined not by personal technical failings or by the significance of the night but by an underlying awareness of a dismaying tradition going back 10 years before they were born, to the nightmare of Chris Waddle and Stuart Pearce in Turin, and featuring Gareth Southgate, Paul Ince, David Batty, David Beckham, Darius Vassell, Frank Lampard, Steven Gerrard, Jamie Carragher, and the Ashleys Young and Cole Gripped by fear of the shootout, England players of every type, age and degree of technical sophistication seem to fall victim to the sudden flash of white light that destroys their ability to bring mind and body together to accomplish a familiar actionSome would define the under-17 defeat as choking: the collapse leading to the loss of a match which had seemed won",sport

"In the mid-1980s, he was closer than ever to snaring that elusive baggy gold cap A powerful lefthander who could drive on the up like his childhood hero Clive Lloyd, McGuire was in fine form at the state trialsOpening the batting with Graeme Wood, and facing a virtual Test attack in Bruce Reid, Chris Matthews, Ken MacLeay and Tom Hogan, he raced to 57 at drinks He was in such good nick, he alleges a selector told him to retire his innings, on the understanding, McGuire thought, that hed made the Shield sideTheyd liked what Id done at the crease, and I was happy, he recalls",sport
"More than 30 years later, the incident still jars with Clough, now a WA bowling coach I was just hoping he wasnt picked because of form and nothing else, he says I still struggle to this day to see how John wasnt chosen for the side",sport

"Daryl Foster was the WA coach Under his tutelage, the Sandgropers won nine Sheffield Shields Now 79, Foster cant recall the trial game but says McGuire was a very fine player who had no technical deficiencies, but was born in the wrong era, an era when WA was the dominant force in Australian cricket and produced Test openers Wood, Bruce Laird, Mike Veletta and Geoff Marsh",sport
"On the face of it, its a compelling argument, backed by former Australian captain Kim Hughes, who notes that Test cricketers played Shield regularly back then, reducing even further opportunities for fringe players (Positions did, however, open up during World Series Cricket and the rebel tours of South Africa",sport
"Was it bad luck, or was he the victim of an institutionalised form of racism, bigger than any player, coach or selector?Richard Walley formed the Metropolitan Aboriginal Cricket Association in Perth in the late 1970s to give young men the chance to play a game still very much linked with Anglo Australia",sport
"That racism extended to the pitch Idris Evans opened the batting with McGuire at Mt Lawley District Cricket Club for more than a decade He remembers McGuires tenacity at the crease, a fierceness that saw him claim the clubs leading scorer award 11 times as Mt Lawley bagged four premierships in the 1980sHe also remembers the impact racial sledging had on McGuire Once when we were batting he was called a coconut",sport
"If he is still bitter about his treatment, it doesnt surprise Evans: I can understand how he feels and why hell take it to his graveI just would have liked one opportunity, McGuire, now 62, and a member of the National Indigenous Cricket Advisory Committee, says Then if I failed I could have said: Well, I had my go, gave it my best shot and didnt make it",sport

"De La Hoyas company, Golden Boy, is promoting a fight between two of boxings biggest stars, Gennady Golovkin and Canelo Alvarez, in September and some believe if the Mayweather-McGregor fight does happen it could overshadow that boutNow, I know critics will say that Im only writing this letter because my company is promoting what will be the culmination of an outstanding boxing year when Canelo Alvarez takes on Gennady GGG Golovkin in September, and I dont want anything to distract attention away from that fight, De La Hoya wrote",sport
De La Hoyas continued that McGregors lack of any professional boxing experience would severely compromise the contestI fully understand the initial attraction from any fan of combat sports McGregor is almost certainly the best pound-for-pound MMA fighter,sport
"Think about it, beyond Bo Jackson and Deion Sanders [in NFL and MLB], what other athlete has successfully competed in two sports in the modern age? And Jackson and Sanders both played both baseball and football throughout their high school and college careers before going professional Furthermore, its not like McGregor would be fighting a good fighter, let alone a mediocre one",sport

"The end of the Premier Leagues 25th campaign provides an opportune moment to marvel at the divisions tremendous tactical and technical development during its first quarter of a century At its inaugural season in 1992-93 the Premier League was largely based around 4-4-2, long balls and getting it in the mixer; 25 years on it is about 3-4-2-1, intricate combination play and gegenpressingThe most significant progress occurred during the mid-1990s",sport
"After the transformative presence of Eric Cantona had established Manchester United as the Premier Leagues dominant force by the mid-1990s, rival clubs desperately attempted to find their equivalent This often proved successful  Arsenal had finished in the bottom half the season before Dennis Bergkamps arrival in 1995, as had Chelsea before Gianfranco Zola joined in 1996",sport
"But basing a side around an inventive No10 did not always work, as Alan Balls Manchester City discovered with Kinkladze, the epitome of a frustrating genius Kinkladze was recruited after a sensational performance in Georgias 5-0 thrashing of Wales in November 1994, a seismic result: only three years after Georgia had gained independence it was their first competitive victory",sport
"Deployed behind Temuri Ketsbaia and Shota Arveladze in a 4312 formation, Kinkladze ran the game and grabbed his first international goal They murdered us, the Wales goalkeeper, Neville Southall, recalled",sport
"The Georgian had been tracked by other clubs, having unsuccessful trials at Real and Atltico Madrid  and, intriguingly, a month-long loan at Boca Juniors, who revere the No10 role more than any club in world football, where Kinkladze met his idol, Diego Maradona None of them signed Kinkladze permanently, however, and instead he joined Manchester City as Balls first signingThe City experience started disastrously They collected two points from their first 11 games, scoring only three goals, while Kinkladze struggled: homesick, unable to speak English and living alone in a Manchester hotel for three months His improvement coincided with the arrival of two Georgian friends and his mother, Khatuna, who brought home comforts: Georgian cognac, walnuts and spices to make his favourite dishes",sport
Kinkladzes Premier League spell is best remembered for a couple of truly magnificent goals,sport
"After Citys relegation Ball lasted only three games before he was replaced by Frank Clark, who tried a similar approach I wanted to build the team around Kinkladze because thats the ideal way to get the best out of him Hes an incredible talent [but] he certainly didnt like running if he didnt have the ball at his feet and I thought there was a certain amount of resentment towards him from some of the squad",sport
"English football had learned to appreciate the quality provided by mysterious, continental No10s, but the Premier League was still largely fixated on varieties of 4-4-2",sport

"In Barcelona Vettel squeezed Hamilton wide on turn one at the Circuit de Catalunya, which Hamilton referred to as dangerous at the time, a remark he later conceded was made in the heat of the moment, concluding their fight had been awesomeThe advantage Mercedes enjoyed for the past three years has meant that the team was not pushed strategically With Ferrari now on a par in terms of race pace, the situation is more complex and the Scuderia has come out of the blocks with some inventive and aggressive tactical decisions Consequently the competitive yet positive relationship between the two drivers had been picked up by the team, Hamilton notedTheres just so much more excitement now that we are fighting against another team, he said",sport

"Arsne Wenger has hinted that Petr Cech will start in goal for Arsenal in Saturdays FA Cup final against Chelsea rather than David Ospina and the manager admitted Kieran Gibbs was an injury doubt, deepening his defensive selection crisisWenger played Ospina, his second-choice goalkeeper, in all eight of the clubs Champions League ties this season, plus the early rounds of the FA Cup But he went with Cech for the quarter-final against Lincoln City and the semi-final against Manchester City and he is expected to persist with the 35-year-old to face his former club at Wembley",sport

Morgan was the adroit helmsman from the 18th over,sport

"Just when the fractured relationships blighting southern hemisphere rugby union seemingly could not deteriorate any further, a new issue is brewing which is likely to add further strainThe relations between Sanzaar and the Super Rugby clubs could hardly be at a lower ebb, and the urgent need for governance reform for the showpiece competition has been highlighted over recent months",sport
"Sanzaars decision to axe three teams from next year has prompted high anxiety, particularly in Australia, with the Melbourne Rebels and Western Force playing out their seasons with an axe hanging over their headsWith the culling saga dragging on, the Victorian Rugby Union and the players association, RUPA, last week called on the ARU to hold an emergency general meeting so the issue could be thrashed out with stakeholders, who are demanding answersThe ARU baulked at holding an EGM because it required giving 21 days notice and instead offered to hold an informal meeting with stakeholder within seven days This meeting was due to be held in Sydney on Friday, but has now been postponed As a result the ARU will now hold an EGM in about three weeks time",sport
"The axing of an Australian team will still be the main item on the agenda at the rescheduled meeting, but there is another issue that is hardly going to help matters",sport
"Sanzaar has proposed the starting date for next years Super Rugby competition be brought forward one week, which means it would kick off around 17 February This is to allow the All Blacks, Springboks and Wallabies an extra week to prepare for the in bound Tests in June against European opposition",sport
"Historically, the southern hemisphere teams have won about 90% of the June Tests in the professional era, but the re-emergence of England as a world superpower under Australian coach Eddie Jones has folks down south getting nervous",sport
"South Africa will host England next year and it was the South Africans who pushed for the change of date, which was supported by Australia and New Zealand",sport
The Australian and New Zealand Super Rugby teams are not happy about it For a winter sport Super Rugby already starts early enough in what is a summer month The New Zealand sides in particular will find it difficult to attract crowds at that time of year,sport
"In Australia a 17 February kick-off would immediately follow the International 10s in Brisbane and the Sydney Sevens the previous week, which is not ideal An earlier start to the season also means there is more chance teams will be missing key international players in the first round or twoIt is clearly not in the best interests of a Super Rugby competition which is struggling for credibility, especially in AustraliaAnd this highlights the fact the Super Rugby teams have little or no control over their own destinies The Sanzaar nations own and administer the Super Rugby competition",sport
"There is no doubt the All Blacks, Springboks and Wallabies are the main revenue generators for the game in their respective countries and the interests of the national teams should always come first",sport
"But the next area of economic growth for southern hemisphere rugby is Super Rugby and the clubs need to be treated as partners, not invitees to a partyPerhaps there needs to be an independent commission to run Sanzaar rather than the national unions to ensure the needs of both international rugby and Super Rugby are met Thats something they could discuss at the EGM",sport

"So while the retiring Crystal Palace manager has probably thought this through carefully, and no doubt intends to take stock of his life, enjoy a bit of travelling and spend more time with his grandchildren, the real test of his resolve will not arrive this summer but most likely in about six or seven months, when some club desperate not to drop out of the Premier League sack their manager and look around for a short-term but sure solution The money on offer would be more than tempting, and after his results at Sunderland and Palace in the past couple of years, not to mention the endorsements from grateful Selhurst Park staff still ringing in his ears at the moment, Allardyce is the firefighter to whom most would turn first",sport

"At the end of a predictably pedestrian close-season match in the harbour city, it was the visitors who most fulfilled their pre-match aspirations in a comfortable 3-0 win, much to the delight of the heavily pro-Liverpool crowd, after goals by Daniel Sturridge, Alberto Moreno and Roberto Firmino set up the mother of all smash and grabsLiverpool will turn round their post-season trip to Australia in devastatingly quick, and possibly unprecedented, fashion: in not much longer than it takes to say veni, vidi, vici, Liverpool came on Wednesday morning, saw the Opera House, signed some autographs in the afternoon, and conquered Sydney in the evening Having secured their place in next seasons Champions League just on Sunday, Jrgen Klopps side will return to Liverpool on Thursday evening, having made their mark on Australia once again in just 36 hours  and banked a presumably sizeable cheque for their efforts",sport

"Few in the crowd were here to watch the A-League champions, who had to settle for the role of bridesmaids, two weeks after they were headlining in their grand final win over Melbourne Victory Make no mistake, this was a night all about Liverpool, from the rendition of Youll Never Walk Alone and the massive club badge in the centre circle before the game to the rousing reception given to veteran call-ups Steven Gerrard and Jamie Carragher on their substitution moments into the second half That pair were replaced by Steve McManaman and Daniel Agger, a sepia-tinged change that only added to the festival atmosphere",sport

"Firmino stamped his authority on the game 11 minutes later with a beautifully judged dink over the top of a static Sydney backline and Moreno finished with aplomb, volleying neatly past Danny VukovicSturridge was again at the heart of the action on 39 minutes, crossing for Firmino to get the final touch as Wilkinson floundered while the best Sydney could muster was an effort from David Carney  who started his professional career on Merseyside, on the other side of Stanley Park on Evertons books  that cannoned off the woodwork on the stroke of half-timeGerrard was denied a penalty  and presumably the chance to take it himself  just before half-time, much to the annoyance of the crowd and, as the sides came off, Klopp berated the official It was difficult to tell whether his anger was genuine or if he was playing up to the crowdThe inevitable raft of changes came at the break as both teams used the match to hand out a bit of experience to younger members of their squads, and the flow of the game suffered, to the extent that a Mexican wave and a hail of paper aeroplanes thrown towards the pitch from the bleachers generated the biggest cheers of the second half until Ben Woodburn almost delivered a fourth goal for Liverpool with a mazy solo run and shot",sport
"That was to be the last of the meaningful action, but the crowd did not go home disappointed Nor did Klopp, who indicated afterwards the long journey was a worthwhile exercise, if not for football reasons, but at least to reach out to the clubs global fan baseWe are here to show ourselves, the club, Liverpool FC, he said",sport

"Team USA, as the only crew definitely involved in the main event, are inevitable favourites, ahead of Team New Zealand and Land Rover BAR  who have been worryingly slow in practice  with the French considered the outsidersThere is nothing sedate about this kind of sailing: the boats reach top speeds of around 85kph and the final practice runs featured Team NZs boat nosediving into the water, one of their sailors leaping overboard to avoid being struck by the rudder, Team USA capsizing twice and the BAR boat accidentally ramming New Zealands when their skipper, Sir Ben Ainslie, by his own admission pushed the limits too far",sport

"These prices, though, only affect those lucky enough to get a ticket On the night, the Friends Arena will have a capacity of 48,000  not ideal for a match featuring clubs as well-supported as United and Ajax That is not to say the biggest games should simply rotate around a few large venues; for many Europa League finals, they would be entirely inappropriate",sport
"It is true Uefa had no idea which teams would reach the final  had Celta Vigo and Lyon won through, fewer fans would have travelled and selling to neutrals at that later stage would have been harder Of course, it is important grounds are full, but there is another wayIf, in less than two weeks, more than 20,000 United and Ajax fans can find the means to get to Stockholm, then in that same period the authorities should be able to make any leftover tickets available to local children and accompanying adults, for cheap or even for free",sport
"Gradually, during birthday parties, communions and endless baptisms, propaganda from my dad and uncles began to form and settle When the time came for me to attend school, the story of Lisbon and Jock Stein and Celtic and Internazionale had been stitched into my mind Im not sure if the concept of a pre-school education was fully formed in Scotland in the 1960s, but in my neighbourhood it began and ended with the legend of the Lisbon Lions",sport
"In my later school years, long after a working grasp of the basic Lisbon narrative had been established, my friends and I took turns to distinguish ourselves with a more rarefied knowledge; one that could only have been obtained by hours of extracurricular study",sport
"At university I discovered my friend Aidan McLaughlin and I shared a guilty secret: we had both memorised entire paragraphs of Celtic Triumphant This is Peebles recollection of Steve Chalmers winning goal in Lisbon: Then, six minutes from the end, to the delight of the Scots and the obvious satisfaction of foreign journalists all around me, Steve Chalmers scored the winner from a pass by Murdoch after a fine through ball by Gemmell the Great",sport
"On one level, Celtics 2-1 victory in the European Cup final over Internazionale, the champions of Italy, must stand as Scotlands greatest sporting achievement Football then, as it is now, was the most popular sport in the world in terms of participation and commerce",sport
"Before Celtic won the European Cup, the only prolonged exposure Scotland had ever enjoyed in front of a mass audience would have been the Hollywood classics Whisky Galore and Brigadoon On the afternoon of 25 May 1967 a global audience sat down for two hours to watch an authentically Scottish product prevail under the most searching conditions The product was seen to be charismatic and attractive and, in the minds of 40 million foreigners, a mental recalibration of previously held thoughts about Scotland and Scots took place",sport
"Did Scotland enjoy a rare wee jag of confidence in that hour? Did we experience for a few precious minutes what it must feel like to be a citizen of one of those famous, beautiful countries endlessly favoured by Hollywood location directors? We Scots can be tetchy and disputatious, often plagued by confidence issues, and forever soliciting other peoples opinions of us In the first chapter of Celtic Triumphant, the author observed something rapturous afterwards: There were Celtic and Rangers supporters; Protestants and Catholics; Pakistanis and pop fans; and all of them were rooting for the Parkhead players in Lisbon As the final whistle blew, many an impromptu jig was danced on a lounge carpet and lifelong Rangers followers have since admitted to a lump in their throat which they couldnt control",sport
"In Celtics triumph we discovered that Scotland was well-regarded in other countries We felt a residual fondness for this country that had probably existed, unspoken and not observed, for many years The source for some of this could have been a high regard for our education and our ability to build ships, bridges and railways",sport

"The central figure in the Europa League final will be the man who is most profoundly absent: Johan Cruyff The former player, coach and guru died 14 months ago but the thrilling young Ajax side who have emerged in the past couple of months are built in his image and according to his principlesThere are few precedents for the speed, scale and significance of the teams transformation Last August, Ajax lost 4-1 to Rostov in a Champions League qualifier with a dire performance that seemed to confirm the once-great Dutch clubs irreversible decline and as recently as last month, the notion Ajax were about to sweep to their first European final since 1996 would have seemed absurdBut the manager, Peter Bosz, in his first season, had been slowly building something remarkable",sport
"Ajax won 2-0 but could have scored six and the ferocity of their pressing and daring use of a high offside line to pen back their opponents was reminiscent of total football No one could quite believe what we were seeing and there was a feeling in the stadium which was almost non-Dutch and non-Ajax, as if the people and players became one body It was intimidating and an emotional release from the fans whod been watching disappointing, boring games for too long",sport
"Almost as impressive was the fighting spirit that saw Ajax recover from near-disaster in the second leg Schalke scored three goals before Ajax rallied and scored twice near the end to reach the last fourThe semi-final against Lyon followed a similar pattern: a stunning home victory  this time 4-1  followed by a wobble in the second leg, staved off with surprising resilience as Ajax won 5-4 on aggregate",sport

"In late 2015, Cruyff was diagnosed with lung cancer His last public appearance, two weeks before he died, came in a short video and photographs taken in Israel with his son Jordi, the technical director of Maccabi Tel Aviv",sport
"For two years Jordi tried to persuade Bosz to join him at Maccabi and, in January last year, he got his man The idea the appointment might be a stepping stone back to the Netherlands was written into the contract Bosz would return home to manage Ajax if the Amsterdam club wanted him",sport
"We do not know if Jordi, or indeed Johan, suggested Bosz to the Ajax directors, or if his talents fitted with their desire for attacking football Either way, after the popular De Boer chose to leave  eventually joining Internazionale for an ill-fated spell  Bosz got the jobIt is now clear that in early March 2016 Bosz had a transformative experience He and Cruyff spent a week talking We dont know exactly what was said but, as Bosz said: In one week I learned enough for 10 years",sport
"He now cites Cruyff constantly and has been putting his ideas into practice Ruud Gullit was among those who warned that pursuing romantic Cruyffian ideas was doomed to fail in modern football Bosz persisted and has slowly taught his team to play the aggressive pressing game we tend to associate with Guardiola and Jrgen Klopp, but which originated with Cruyff in the Ajax and Holland teams of the 70sLike Cruyff, Bosz gives his players confidence to take risks and urges them to play hard, be creative and express themselves The flowering of players under his tutelage has been remarkable",sport

"Even that was not a reaction to the final-day shakeout of the league table, in which Manchester City and Liverpool claimed the final two qualification places behind Chelsea and Arsenals keenest rivals, Tottenham Hotspur, for next seasons Champions League Instead it was a blunt and somewhat insensitive clarification three days after the leaking of Fridays news that he had turned down a 1bn offer for his 67% shareholding from the Russian-Uzbek billionaire Alisher Usmanov, himself a 30% stakeholderThe fact that a rare Kroenke public utterance, at this era-defining moment of slippage from the Champions League, was a brisk matter of money told its own story That he should say of his corporate vehicle KSE [Kroenke Sports Enterprises] UK, that its shares in Arsenal are not, and never have been, for sale was odd and uneasily phrased The next sentence, according to Tim Payton of the Arsenal Supporters Trust, gave it away: KSE is a committed, long-term investor in Arsenal and will remain so",sport
"David Dein, the former vice-chairman whose football nous is still commonly said to be missed in todays corporate operation, began by selling his stake to Usmanov for 75m after he was marched out of the door, oddly, for encouraging Kroenke to buy into the club The sitting Arsenal shareholders, led by the late Danny Fiszman, took against Usmanov amid unease about his backstory and decided a sale to Kroenke, an American corporate sports franchise owner who married into the Walmart family, was preferableKroenke paid the unholy fortune to them in April 2011, 11,750 per Arsenal share Lady Nina Bracewell-Smith, who inherited her stake from her great grandfather-in-law, Sir Bracewell Smith, made 116m Fiszman, who was terminally ill by then, made 159",sport

Unquestionably the Premier Leagues dominant tactical trend was the three-man defence,sport
"Its overwhelming popularity was largely down to the influence of Antonio Conte at Chelsea His decision to switch to a three-man defence in the second half of the 3-0 defeat by Arsenal in September proved a turning point and is arguably the most significant tactical decision in the Premier Leagues history Chelseas subsequent run of 13 successive victories, the first six without conceding a single goal, was the main reason for their title success",sport
"Chelseas system was flexible  at times it looked as if the wing-backs were part of the defence, at other points in the midfield line, but it was most effective when Victor Moses and Marcos Alonso pushed forward aggressively and effectively formed a front five with Pedro Rodrguez, Diego Costa and Eden Hazard Teams found it impossible to cope with their back four being overloaded, with Chelseas wing-backs regularly popping up unmarked at the far post to convert when the opposition had been dragged to the opposite flankRonald Koemans Everton were thrashed 5-0 at Stamford Bridge when attempting to match Chelseas shape but opponents often found themselves faring better when deploying wing-backs Pep Guardiolas unusual 3-2-4-1 system should have beaten Chelsea at the Etihad but Chelsea fought back and recorded a 3-1 victory, their most important win of the campaign Chelseas winning run was ended in January by Spurs, who also played 3-4-3",sport

"This seasons rise underlines that the majority of Premier League teams have generally played positive football Perhaps only Middlesbrough, Sunderland and Watford were unduly negative  others may have defended deep but usually offered a sufficient counterattacking threat too",sport
"The high goals-per-game ratio was also a reflection of the inequality in the division The 15-point gap between seventh-placed Everton and eighth-placed Southampton was notable but more significant is the fact the top seven recorded goal-difference figures of +18 or more, and everyone else managed -7 or lessThe final day of the season, when the top four sides defeated the bottom four sides by an aggregate scoreline of 20-2, rather underlined the disparity and, while a high goals-per-game rate is usually celebrated as a good thing, it is worth considering the numbers in more detail",sport

"Lethlean ruled out an immediate change to rules concerning the bounce but said the issue was worthy of investigationThere will be no change to the bounce this season, but its certainly a commission decision at some stage this year to whether theres a change or not, Lethlean saidJust because there is a occupational health and safety review doesnt mean the bounce has to go It actually means there are ways to mitigate and prevent injuries, if thats the case, by way of training methods, frequency, better medical and researchThe centre bounce is understood to put a strain on umpires backs and shoulders, and calls to seek an alternative method of restarting play have been heard before",sport
"But taking the bounce out of the game has proved difficult, with the more conservative factions within the AFL keen to uphold traditional elements of the gameIts an unusual and unique facet of our game that I think is a fantastic part of the game, but if the overwhelming evidence and facts are that its removing umpires from our game, limiting the umpires that we get, losing good decision-makers and good umpires and causing injuries, weve got to consider [changes], Lethlean said",sport

"Sunderland are seeking their eighth manager in six turbulent years after David Moyes concluded a calamitous 10 months on Wearside by resigning on Monday afternoonThe former Everton, Manchester United and Real Sociedad manager departed after a meeting with Ellis Short, Sunderlands owner, and Martin Bain, the chief executive, in London He leaves the relegated club without compensation after presiding over only six Premier League wins all season, falling out with some key players and failing to persuade Short to agree to his proposal of signing virtually an entirely new team this summerSunderland will spend the next few days taking stock before attempting to recruit a replacement but their eventual shortlist could well include Slavisa Jokanovic The Fulham managers Craven Cottage contract contains a break clause and he and Bain previously worked well together at Maccabi Tel Aviv",sport
"Whoever takes over must cope without Jermain Defoe after Sunderlands leading scorer opened talks with Bournemouth on Monday Defoes contract contains a clause enabling him to leave the Stadium of Light on a free transferMoyes could soon be a candidate to replace the currently vulnerable Gordon Strachan as Scotland coach but his departure represents a loss of face for Short, who recruited the 54-year-old Glaswegian at the fifth attempt last July At the time Sam Allardyces successor was unaware that the billionaire American financier was hoping to sell Sunderland and failed to realise the club were well over 100m in debtNonetheless Moyes was allowed to spend 30m last summer but his signings failed to impress and, with the team struggling, he privately considered walking out as early as last autumn",sport
"By then Sunderland fans were already becoming disillusioned with his perceived negativity but Short  who would have had to fork out 3m in recompense had he sacked him only one year into a four-year contract  was reluctant to pay off yet another manager Moreover, like Bain, the owner clung to the hope that Moyes would prove the long-term solution to Sunderlands woesAt the start of this month Moyes hinted that he was minded to quit but a meeting with Short and Bain a fortnight ago ended with the pair offering him their unequivocal support and Short pondering his rebuilding plans",sport

"The sports minister, Greg Hunt, unveiled the initiative at the Australian Institute of Sport on Monday, outlining a vision for sport in Australia for the next 10 years while attempting to allay fears a lottery would encourage gamblingThe plan, which focuses on four central themes  participation, performance, promoting health through physical activity, and integrity  will be introduced as part of the 2017-18 budgetIt is open for public submissions until 31 July, and Hunt promised key stakeholders  including the states and territories, the Australian Sports Commission (ASC) and their respective sports, the Australian Olympic Committee (AOC) and Paralympic Committee and Commonwealth Games Australia  would be consulted",sport
"The government said it was seeking to understand Australias expectations of the sports sector through the creation of a national planThe question of funding is always important, Hunt said This plan will consider, with a strong bias towards support, a national sports lottery There are great examples around the world, most notably the UK, of funding on a secure basis coming from a national sports lotteryWhen asked if a lottery would add to Australias gambling problem, which is particularly prevalent in sport, Hunt again highlighted the example of the UK",sport
"The way this works is this is a public-good lottery and that concept is something that is well accepted, Hunt said We see in Western Australia a public-good lottery, we see in the United Kingdom public-good lotteriesThats a very accepted approach and it is a sensible way to provide additional permanent sports funding which I think is fair, reasonable [and] appropriateIf you have it legislated and highly regulated and its a public-good lottery then thats sensibleAs with the UK model, Olympic sports would stand to benefit from lottery funding and the announcement was welcomed by the Australian Olympic Committee",sport
"The AOC chief executive, Matt Carroll, said the initiative was critical for Australias sporting future The national plan will bring clarity on the roles and responsibilities of all the parties involved and establish the support, infrastructure and funding required to achieve the collective sporting outcomes for the country, Carroll said",sport

"In the UK, sport has benefited from lottery funding since 1997 Since then, British athletes have won 633 Olympic and Paralympic medals and GB have re-emerged as an international sporting powerThe establishment of a sports tribunal  something of a national equivalent to Switzerlands court of arbitration of sport  aims to address the plans final aim of integrity",sport
"Hunt said without an independent body, sports are effectively able to sit in judgment of themselves in matters such as doping, a situation that we should move beyondThere are always the players who are in the shadows and we want to keep those out of Australian sport and we want to rub them out of Australian sport, Hunt saidAny national tribunal would need the cooperation of each individual sport, but Hunt was confident there would be a willingness to participate and said he would be surprised if there was an Australian sport that wouldnt opt in",sport

"The news that Hull had lost was greeted with jubilation by the home supporters beforehand and fuelled the raucous atmosphere inside the Liberty Stadium, helping to carry Swansea to victory It was tense for long periods but especially in the closing stages, when Clement admitted his mind drifted back to that chastening defeat against Tottenham Hotspur, when Swansea conceded three late goals On this occasion, however, his players refused to buckle",sport
Alfie Mawson was outstanding in central defence alongside the excellent Federico Fernndez The evergreen Leon Britton produced another influential performance at the base of the Swansea midfield and Jordan Ayew never stopped running up front,sport

"It did help that the Cherry and White defence, impressive for lengthy periods, slackened momentarily to allow Ian Whitten to carve straight through some softish defence to score under the posts and reduce the interval deficit to 15-13 If anything the games pace then cranked up another notch, with both sides determined to end the regular campaign in style",sport
"Had there not been a knock-on in the build-up, May would have been a contender for finish of the season as he soared up and over his England team-mate Jack Nowell, only for the Chiefs to work their way back upfield for the replacement Sam Simmonds to put the prop Ben Moon over by the left corner flag James Short and Chudley duly secured the bonus point, cancelling out Mays second score at the other end The last quarter, as so often in recent months, was a case of the Chiefs once again showing their opponents who is boss",sport

George Honeyman should really have given Sunderland an early lead but the young midfielder  decent throughout  headed wide after connecting with Billy Joness inviting cross after Jermain Defoes decoy run had distracted Hulls defenceCheered on by their convalescent midfielder Ryan Mason  back at the KCom for the first time since fracturing his skull at Chelsea in January  Silvas side made an ominously shaky start,sport
"Accustomed to sitting back at home before hurting visitors on the counter-attack, they were now supposed to be dominant but did not seem to have entirely got the hang of it Almost imperceptibly such uncertainty spread to an initially noisy home crowd, prompting chants of Is this a library? from Sunderlands large, vocal and surprisingly cheerful, travelling support",sport
"Not for the first time this season Sam Clucas did more than any other Hull player, bar the menacing Kamil Grosicki, to recalibrate the mood",sport
"Clucas needed to watch his step after collecting a booking for fouling Didier Ndong but he retained sufficient cool to whisk the ball off Defoes toecaps as the England striker threatened to end his recent goal droughtEldin Jakupovic, whose late penalty save the previous weekend earned Hull the point at Southampton that sent Sunderland down, did similarly well to repel Defoes shot at the end of a rapid Sunderland break while Pickfords intervention just prevented Alfred NDiaye heading Grosickis cross beyond him",sport
"Pickfords wonderful reflexes and brilliant footwork are coveted by a host of leading clubs and he emphasised his ability with a fabulous fingertip save which somehow steered Lazar Markovics header to safety after the Liverpool loanee met Ahmed Elmohamadys pinpoint cross If Jordan leaves us this summer, it will be for a big price, said Moyes A really, really big price",sport
"As John OSheas sliding interception forced Hernndez into shooting wide, Hull fans grew despondent The previously real prospect of a bright Premier League future was dimming with every passing minute with the lights very nearly going out completely when Jones stunned both sets of supporters by giving Sunderland the lead",sport
"By now alternately disconsolate and frantic, Silva replaced a midfielder with a striker, swapping NDiaye with Dieumerci Mbokani but, for once, his customary boldness rebounded as Defoe scored a late, arguably offside, close-range, second for SunderlandMy home record isnt important, said Hulls manager",sport
"After a forgettable first half, Vokess 56th-minute opener ignited proceedings with the visitors scoring twice in 12 minutes through Salomn Rondn and Craig Dawson having previously gone nearly nine hours without a goal",sport
"A first victory on their travels since New Years Eve eluded West Brom as Vokes capitalised on Ben Fosters poor decision to come out for a free-kick, the striker levelling with four minutes remaining to take Burnley to 40 pointsInjuries to Ben Mee and Michael Keane meant that Burnley had to deploy an inexperienced centre-back pairing of James Tarkowski and Kevin Long, but the pair were scarcely tested in the opening half as the home team registered the only two opportunities of note",sport
"George Boyd created the first with a left-wing cross that was met by a near-post Vokes volley that deflected off Gareth McAuley and was kept out by Fosters legBoyd was involved in the move for the other chance as were Vokes and Ashley Barnes, the latter feeding Scott Arfield, who bore down on goal before seeing his shot stopped by James McCleans terrific sliding interventionBurnley had an even better opportunity early in the second period as the unmarked Tarkowski met Arfields corner only for his bullet header to clear the crossbar",sport
"Tony Pulis withdrew Jonny Evans shortly after, possibly due to a first-half foot injury, and five minutes later Burnley went aheadJake Livermore was hanging on to Barness back as the two entered the box and tumbled down and the assistant flagged for a penalty Mike Jones, the referee, allowed play to continue and Barnes had the foresight to cross for Vokes to sweep a first-time finish beyond Foster",sport
"The official deserved credit for hanging fire when it came to the awarding of any decision while Barness vision to get off the turf and swing a cross in was also admirableThe visiting side had offered little attacking threat as they edged towards the nine-hour mark without a goal, but all that changed 10 minutes after Vokess opener as Dawson reached Chris Brunts corner and the ball looped on to the crossbarWest Brom eventually reworked the ball out to the left flank where Matt Lowton was caught out by McClean and neither Long nor Tarkowski could prevent his cross reaching Rondn, who fired in his first goal since December",sport
Tarkowski tried to redeem himself with a stinging volley that he fired into Marc Wilsons arm but he was caught out 12 minutes from time,sport
"The visitors earned a corner when Livermores effort was deflected over and from Brunts delivery, Dawson lost Tarkowski, heading against Barness chest, with the ball then going in off the post for West Broms 15th set-piece goal of the seasonIt was another dead-ball situation that helped Burnley claim a share of the spoils",sport

"My horse does everything the right way, Moore said, and through the race he filled me with a lot of confidence Hes done everything right all his career and I couldnt have been happier with himHes improved with every run and hes come out and beaten the best at two, and hes put up the best performance so far at three",sport
"It meant Craig Shakespeare has now recorded five successive home victories since replacing Claudio Ranieri in February  the first Leicester manager to achieve that feat in the top flight since Gordon Milne in 1984That statistic, coupled with the fact they are now on course to finish higher than Chelsea could manage in their title defence last year, should go a long way to ensuring the former assistant is handed the post on a permanent basis",sport
"The whole club can be very pleased that we have been able to secure Premier League survival, said Shakespeare Now we have three games left and I want to try and finish on a highIn a week when Leicesters players said goodbye to the trophy they won last year at an impromptu ceremony in the training ground canteen, it remains to be seen how many of the players who contributed to such a memorable achievement will be here with him come AugustDemarai Grays plea for more opportunities when the 20-year-old has been restricted to nine league starts this season appeared to have fallen on deaf ears as Shakespeare named his tried and trusted starting XI once again for this dead rubberMahrez became the first Algerian to make 100 appearances in the Premier League, although last seasons PFA player of the year is also believed to be having itchy feet now the fairytale story of the past two seasons is finally at an end",sport
"Reports have suggested that Barcelona have been keeping tabs on his progress, but aside from the odd flicker Mahrez has rarely risen to the exalted heights of the 2015-16 title-winning campaignOn the strength of those performances, his agents negotiated a new contract last summer containing an agreement that will allow him to leave the club if a suitable offer  understood to be around 40m  is receivedThat price tag could prove to put off the majority of suitors but Mahrez appeared intent on showing why he may be worth the risk with a performance that was oozing with skill and was capped by his 10th goal of the season in all competitions",sport
"Watford, who have now lost five successive away matches without scoring since their win at Arsenal in January, left their captain, Troy Deeney, on the bench in favour of Stefano OkakaWalter Mazzarri has promised to take an intensive course in English at the end of the season despite having spent the best part of two years in the country before his arrival at Vicarage Road",sport
"Mahrez left the field to a standing ovation when he was replaced by Gray, but the best moment was reserved for the second minute of stoppage timeJamie Vardy, who has shown his quality in the past few weeks as Leicester have pulled away from the bottom three, broke down the left and timed his pass to perfection for Albrighton to fire home via the post",sport
"It was a year ago so it was good to put it behind us, said Shakespeare We have to move on from that now I dont think you can take anything for granted in football",sport
"He and his superiors will just hope they can persuade Mahrez, Vardy and some of Leicesters other heroes that the grass is not always greener on the other side Leicester celebrated becoming the unlikeliest champions in the Premier League years, possibly in football history",sport
"Manchester City moved into third place in the Premier League on goal difference as Pep Guardiolas commitment to attack paid dividends against Crystal Palace, who have claimed some impressive scalps over the last month but were always on the back foot here Given the number of times the home sides fleet-footed front runners gave the visitors patched-up defence a chasing, the margin of victory could have been even more emphatic but otherwise City made light of the absence of Sergio Agero with their biggest league win of the season to leave Palace looking elsewhere for confirmation of their safetySam Allardyce enjoyed telling everyone how he tactically outsmarted Liverpool at Anfield a fortnight ago and, to his credit, he was just as willing to front up after a far less convincing performance resulted in his heaviest defeat with his present side",sport
"Even before the goals started to go in, it was never difficult to tell the teams apart",sport
"Zabaleta came on to take over at right-back for the last 22 minutes and was involved in the fourth goal, nodding Yaya Tours cross into Sterlings path for the winger to apply a left-foot finish, then Nicols Otamendi completed the scoring with a spectacular flying header from De Bruynes free-kick Jesus had left the field by then, oddly goalless on a day when all around him seemed to be filling their boots, though City will be relieved to see the young Brazilian manage more than 80 minutes without mishapIt will be surreal in the extreme when Novak Djokovic goes on court in defence of his title in Madrid next week, glances up at his box and the growling, comforting countenances of his fiercely loyal Serbian friends are missing",sport
"Whatever the agreed public stance of mutual agreement, these are close friends and confidants he has let go, not just employees They have been with him most of the past decade and were a tight-knit unitDjokovics departing coach, Marian Vajda, had been alongside him since 2006, before he won the first of his 12 slam titles, fitness coach Gebhard GG Phil Gritsch was there eight years to the day, as he said later, and his physiotherapist, Miljan Amanovic, had been a part of this imposing inner sanctum for just as long, rarely quoted, unquestioningly committed to the cause",sport
Quite who Djokovic will call on to replace his compadres is a mystery He followed Murrays lead three years ago when he turned to a former leading player in Boris Becker and he might do something similar again There will be no shortage of candidates and whoever it is will have the luxury of a relatively free hand,sport
"Even the ebullient German sometimes wondered if he was as deeply embedded as the others He notoriously risked his bosss wrath when he revealed last year that they often called out to their employer during a match in Serb or Croat, possibly passing on advice that bordered on coaching, which is not allowed When Becker left, it was thought the Djokovic camp would turn inwards again and remain strong",sport
"The new season brought no respite Djokovic lost to Denis Istomin in the first week of the Australian Open, just before Murray lost to Mischa Zverev, which opened the door for Federers astonishing return after six months away",sport
"In a carefully prepared statement on his Facebook page on Friday afternoon, Djokovic asserted: I want to find a way to come back to the top stronger and more resilient",sport
"Before he fell to earth on his second visit to Paris last year, Djokovic was the hunted, the world No1 for 122 weeks in a row Even after losing to the estimable David Goffin in Monte Carlo last month, he was adamant: I fear no one",sport

"The Samoans, fifth in the world rankings, were widely expected to cause problems While they did that in fits and bursts, the England coach will have been delighted with what was, for the most part, an accomplished and polished performance",sport
"In the first 40 minutes, England were near-faultless That they led 14-0 was no less than they deserved with notable performances across the park Sam Burgess looked back to his imposing best after an off-colour Four Nations, James Graham supported him ably in the front-row while Josh Hodgson, the former Hull KR hooker and now with Cronulla, led the way with ball in handThe opening moments set the tone for what would follow England forced an error from the physically imposing Samoans before a superb pass from Sean OLoughlin  who produced an impressive display on his return as captain  allowed Ryan Hall to cross for his 34th try in as many Tests",sport

"A dark cloud has been hanging over the Kentucky Derby this weekend as horse trainers have made public their anger at Trumps immigration policies, which they say are hurting the Kentucky Derby, the USs most glamorous horse racing eventWe cant find workers this year  its been tough, says Julio Rubio of the Kentucky Horsemens Benevolent and Protective Association Most of the workers we have at the track wont even leave to go out at night to buy groceries because they are so scared of being deported",sport
The horse racing industry is big business in Kentucky It brings more than $4bn a year to the state The owners of horses at Churchill Downs racetrack are among the countrys economic elite; derby winners can bring in purses that easily exceed $1m,sport
"But the race, and the work of the wider industry, rest largely on the backs of an immigrant workforce making on average $400-$600 a week as well as free lodging in a huge dormitory inside the Churchill Downs complex The skilled work typically requires a regular crew of guest workers, who live in Mexico in the offseason",sport
"Theres a lot of uncertainty about whether or not we are going to have the labor force we need, Dale Romans, the second-winningest trainer in Churchill Downs history, told the UKs Channel 4 News this weekThe owners are not the only ones who are angry Heavy rain last Thursday marred the Pegasus Day parade that marks the opening of the annual Kentucky Derby festival",sport
Nunes led a group of half a dozen Mijenete activists dressed in the dark green sashes that prizewinning horses at the Derby wear They handed out flyers calling on Louisville to become a sanctuary city,sport
"The normally festive parade had turned into a mess of ponchos and crying children But despite the cold weather, the crowds reaction to the flyers, featuring a mint julep and calling on activists to #CrushIce, appeared to be warmActivists with Mijente said the Derby marked the first time the states economic elite had addressed the issue of immigration",sport
"Its hypocritical, said Jesus Ibanez We are glad that they are concerned for the individuals working at the horse stalls, but this has been happening throughout the city, and they say nothing",sport
"Ibanez said that since Trump had taken office, approximately 100 undocumented immigrants had been arrested in raids in the Louisville area He described fear in the community amid stories that mothers had been arrested when walking their children to schoolMy God, I was getting calls left and right from families not taking their kids to school, said Ibanez They werent going anywhere outside of their homesDespite the relative silence of the business community regarding the raids, Nunes said that she saw the outrage on behalf of horse owners as a sign of progress for the growing immigrant community in Louisville",sport
"We have really been embraced, said Nunes Communities are coming out for us  lesbian groups, Black Lives Matter, the unions, the churches  they all come out for us",sport
"The activists, owners and the crowds seemed to be making the best of the parade, and the weather, until someone spotted Kentuckys notoriously anti-union Republican governor, Matt BevinThe immigrant activists started booing him and Bevin quickly fled to the other side of the street to continue his glad-handing with the crowd",sport
"But cornered by the Guardian, Bevin too expressed concern about how immigration policies are affecting the Kentucky Derby this yearI mean, the reality is that we need employment, we need people who are here legally, so we need to make it easy and fast for people to be immigrated into the United States, says Bevin We need immigration; we need safe immigration; we need fast immigration",sport
"Back on the sidewalk on East Broadway, Nunes said she was shocked by Bevins statementsIs it an opening? Yeah, I do think its an opening, but the people they are having conversations with arent people like us Its business owners, said Nunes",sport

"Despite spending four years as an assistant to first Koeman and then Rutten, who coincidentally was in charge of PSV for that 10-0 defeat, the former Rangers and Arsenal midfielder was an unexpected choice But Konterman believes the appointment of the former Holland midfielders Jan Wouters and Jean-Paul van Gastel, club captain in 1999, to his backroom staff was a masterstrokeGiovanni has surprised me, says Konterman I played with him at Rangers and for Holland but in my eyes he wasnt a leader What he is doing now is fantastic and he has done well to organise a strong team around him",sport

Stuart JamesWhy are they in this mess?One word: Venkys",sport

"Chad Wingard, Brad Ebert and Jared Polec battled hard for the Power, but the sides failure to use the ball with precision and capitalise when in attack proved costly Charlie Dixon was also strong for the Power and finished with four goals, 22 disposals and 10 marks",sport
"Port dominated various stages of the third term, but failed to reap the reward for their effort, kicking three consecutive points before Charlie Dixon managed to drill the ball home after scooping on a loose ball from a contest Dixon was vital to the home sides spirited attempt at a comeback in the final term and his third goal - a massive set-shot conversion from the boundary line - helped cut the Eagles buffer to just 14 points Despite the Powers desperation, errors with its disposal cost it in the end and the Eagles solid record in Adelaide remained intactEarlier on Saturday in Tasmania, Jarrad Waite made a thumping return for North Melbourne, the powerful forward booting six goals to help seal a 59-point win and end Adelaides unbeaten start in the AFL The Kangaroos dominated play from the opening siren, keeping the Crows scoreless in the first quarter and maintaining their lead at every break in the 22",sport

The result is Adelaides first loss for the season and only Norths second win from seven roundsEliud Kipchoge is unlikely to make another dedicated assault on the two-hour marathon barrier in the foreseeable future despite coming within 26 seconds in Italy on Saturday of achieving a feat many thought impossible The 32-year-old Olympic champion produced a bravura display of time-trial running to finish in two hours and 25 seconds  well inside the official world record of 2:02:57 set by Dennis Kimetto in 2014,sport
"However, his time will not enter the record books because he was helped by a phalanx of 30 elite pacers, who subbed in and out of the race, which is against the official rules of the sports governing body, the International Association of Athletics FederationsWhile there will be an obvious temptation for Nike  which spent millions on marketing the attempt and the technology behind it  to try again, they now have other priorities Matt Nurse, vice-president of the Nike sport research lab, told the Observer: This is one particular endeavour where we have learned an awful lot about performance running, but another attempt is probably not what some other people [in our organisation] want to do",sport
"We are already discussing other moonshots, perhaps related to female athletes or average athletes So its not one and done, it just may take a different form next timeKipchoge said he was happy with his performance despite knowing that if he had run a one second a mile faster it would have carried him under two hours",sport
"We are going up the tree, he added I have lifted a branch and I am going on to the next one",sport
"Kipchoge was also using a new carbohydrate-rich sports drink, delivered by helpers on mopeds so he did not have to slow down  another practice not allowed in major marathons",sport
"Then there was the use of Nikes Zoom Vaporfly Elite shoes, which some have suggested should be illegal because they contain a special curved plate that allows runners to roll through instead of bending toes and losing energy",sport
"Nike has made extraordinary claims for the footwear, claiming a 4% improvement in running economy, and by happy coincidence a version of the shoes will be available in shops from next monthDespite all this help, breaking two hours was still a massive undertaking",sport
"Jones predicted a sub two-hour marathon was now firmly in sight I do believe that if you had all of the best runners in the world in the same race in perfect conditions, you could see a sub two-hour marathon and what weve been implementing here might get people working together to achieve that goalThe event may have had an artificial air given Nike had set it up as part lab test, part two-hour advertorial for its new shoes, but that should not eclipse the fact that this was one of the most remarkable and determined displays of distance running ever seen",sport

"When a man is tired of London, well, theres probably a fair chance he is a Tottenham fan in early May On a chilly, noisy night inside the London Stadium Spurs entered this derby game hoping to apply pressure to Chelseas shoulder but knowing they could forfeit the league title, too, by losing the gameAnd so it came to pass: another boisterous night in May, another wild, fingernail-gnawing London derby defeat Almost exactly a year ago a wild draw at Chelsea had seen Spurs give up the ghost on last seasons title challenge Here the only goal of a bitty game decorated with heavy tackles came from Manuel Lanzini after 65 minutes",sport
"With West Ham still paddling near the bottom, Spurs were expected to muscle their way through this match en route to more urgent engagements Somehow it never quite looked like happening as West Ham played well throughout, solid and spiky in deep defence and finding unexpected space in Tottenhams backlineIt made for an engrossing spectacle as the minutes ticked away",sport

"Its always good to have someone like that in the squad A guy with a bit of x-factor, if they took him down to New Zealand it adds a bit of spice I really think that New Zealand would have seen him as a threat and would really have had to mark him",sport

"Wade had touched down seven tries in his last seven matches but failed to score last week in the 32-13 defeat by Harlequins, which has put Waspss hopes of a home semi-final in jeopardy despite topping the table for much of the season Indeed, Wade touched the ball just twice against Harlequins and there is the growing sense that Wasps attacking rhythm has been out of kilter since their comprehensive Champions Cup defeat by Leinster last monthThey are still the top try-scorers in the Premiership by a distance but Wasps host the defending champions Saracens on Saturday and must avoid a first home defeat of the season to guarantee a top-two finishWe know we have a very good attack, said the director of rugby, Dai Young, who has recalled Danny Cipriani at fly-half with Gopperth returning to inside-centreWe have scored 114 tries in the two main competitions this season",sport

"Pochetino said his decision to omit Mousa Dembl from the starting line-up did not contribute to his teams defeat Dier and Victor Wanyama began in central midfield in front of a back four, with Dembl not arriving until the second half, just as he had done in the victory over Arsenal last weekend",sport

"On the other hand, depending on results elsewhere, a draw may keep them up",sport
"If the other teams are losing and we are doing all right, Ill try and keep it tight The worst-case scenario is if we hear Birmingham are winning four-nil and Forest have scored five because that would leave us needing about sevenThe situation might not be quite so tense at the bottom but for the wholesale changes Huddersfield Town made at Birmingham last weekend, which allowed Harry Redknapps team an unexpected three points",sport
"Mowbray arrived at Blackburn with 10 weeks remaining of the season and in 14 games has suffered only three defeats, though he freely admits there have not been enough victoriesWhen you are at the bottom what you really need is a run of wins  thats the only thing that will catapult you up the table, he says Winning boosts everyones confidence but if you draw the next game it slips away and you are sucked back inBlackburn have been in steady decline since the clubs owners decided they could do without Sam Allardyce Mowbray would not come in for particular criticism should the club find itself in League One and would be happy to stay on as manager, though with a sigh and an exasperated gesture towards the extremely well-appointed training facilities in view through the window, he points out what should be obvious",sport

"Swanseas manager is aware that his team could be five points adrift by the time they kick-off at home against Everton on Saturday night, with Marco Silvas side hosting Sunderland earlier in the day, yet he is convinced that his players have turned a corner in recent weeks and is confident they can escape the threat of relegation if they win successive home games for the first time in 12 monthsWeve got to do the business [against Everton], Clement said Got to get a good result",sport
"Thankfully we have turned that corner and performed well, four points out of Stoke at home and Manchester United away is a good return And it could have been six points, so now why cant we go into Everton and take all three points?Hulls match against Sunderland will finish roughly 40 minutes before Swansea kick-off and Clement is realistic enough to know that everyone is going to know the result in his dressing room Whether Hull win, lose or draw, weve still got to win",sport
"Clement is expected to retain the midfield diamond that has served Swansea well, which means Jordan Ayew will once again partner Fernando Llorente up front Ayew is still looking for his first goal since arriving from Aston Villa in January, yet the Ghanaian has impressed alongside Llorente, with Clement reporting that the strikers physical statistics were almost off the chart against Stoke and saying they were the same again against Man UnitedHes come close [to a goal], Clement added",sport
"Was this a trick question?Wenger looked momentarily baffled What does Tarmac on a drive have to do with Arsenals predicament? The inquisitor clarified with the suggestion that maybe doing some home improvements meant zil wanted to stick around a while A promising sign for the contract situation, perhaps",sport
"Here is the thing, though zils form has dipped to the point where the handsome offer, on the table for ages, has become a serious debating point Arsenal are not in the business of routinely offering players in the region of the 250,000 to 300,000 per week mooted to tempt zil and Alexis Snchez",sport
There was a point earlier in the season when zil began to look more than ever like the technical leader and inspirer-in-chief Arsenal were eager to pin their hopes on,sport
"Wenger agrees zil is a character who benefits from some tough love We had some good conversations with him as well, you know, he says",sport
"Not for the first time, Wenger is compelled to offer up a defence of zil while the critics sharpen their opinion of someone who can be an easy target because of his languid style Big players have to carry the responsibility of the team People look at it like that, Wenger saysLast Sunday [at Tottenham] to just criticise Mesut zils performance does not reflect exactly what happened on the pitch I think he did fight very hard in recent games  we looked at his physical performance and they were at a very high level",sport
You want all your players to be at their best in every single game so when they dont achieve that of course you are frustrated but we all played football We know we are only human beings and you have to accept the ups and downs,sport
"Does this drop in form make Wenger reconsider the sense in the massive contract on offer? Before we spend big money we analyse all the aspects of commitments, because we have not only Mesut zil and Snchez to extend",sport
"The challenge to eke out more of those performances remains an Arsenal riddle, and its one that will be under consideration during the summer if zils contract extension stays unsigned",sport
"That begs the question of which clubs might queue up to spend lavishly on this gossamer talent and match or exceed those big wages for class that has not shone consistently for Arsenal Have there been any offers, any signs of interest from other clubs? No, says Wenger bluntly After another pause he offers a cryptic addendum",sport
Tottenham Hotspurs title charge skidded to a halt at the London Stadium as Manuel Lanzini struck a second-half goal that was celebrated as lustily by Chelsea fans as it was by the West Ham faithful,sport
Mauricio Pochettinos men arrived on a nine-game winning streak and a mission to slash Chelseas lead at the top of the table to a single point but they performed sluggishly and left with nothing but regrets,sport
In fairness this was not a terrible display by a team that have undoubtedly made progress this season but Pochettinos side did fall below the standard they set in recent months when whittling Chelseas lead down from 13 points to four There was an unfamiliar stodginess to their play and their defence wobbled uncharacteristically,sport

"The mere fact that Fabre wants to run Al Wukair in the Newmarket Classic seems a positive sign The Frenchman has been represented in the race on only nine occasions, winning twice and saddling the second on two others This colt will be his third runner since Xaar was a disappointing favourite 19 years ago",sport

"The Football League has written to Huddersfield asking for an explanation, while making it clear that any punishment will be in the nature of a fine rather than a replay or restatement of the result Birmingham keep the points, in other words, and while Redknapps side could still go down on the final day this weekend, Forest and Blackburn sit two points closer to the trapdoorIt is an unsatisfactory situation, certainly, though some sympathy was possible with Dean Whiteheads tweet, when the veteran midfielder observed that over 45 games Huddersfield had earned the right to name any team they liked once their play-off place was attained, while Forest and Blackburn only had themselves to blame if they were still in the mire with one match to go",sport
"The Championship is a notoriously long and hard grind, and going up via the play-offs is no easy task after such a demanding season Wagner naturally wants to give himself and his side the best chance, and if he decides it is more important to have fresh, rested players than finish a place or two higher in the final table, who is to say he is wrong?Were the promotion system simply a matter of finishing as high up the table as possible, as it used to be, there would be less excuse for picking ones matches at the end, but the play-off routine is a mini-competition in its own right, a crisis built into the constitution, and if the EFL is going to ask its promotion hopefuls to jump through this final hoop it cannot really object to clubs making the necessary preparationsFurthermore, Wagner has been rotating fairly heavily all season",sport

"When the Premiership adopted the play-offs in 2002-03, the main reason given was that with clubs shorn of their international players for three months of the season  more than one-third of the league campaign  the system was fairer on those who supplied a large number of players to England and other Test sides than first-past-the-postNot that the champions will revert to whoever leads the table at the end of the final round of matches from 2019-20 if the club season expands to 10 months, with the international weekends to be largely filled with Anglo-Welsh-South Africa Cup matches It would allow clubs to be at full throttle for virtually the entire Premiership campaign, but the play-offs are lucrative and Twickenham sells out for the final",sport

"His first assist came as part of a wonderful back-to-front team move Juventuss No23 was involved twice, playing a pass to Higuan by the halfway line before charging forward and, having regained possession, backheeling the ball into the strikers path to leave him with the simplest of finishesThe touch was the sumptuous end to a sumptuous passage of play and there was more to come from Alves on 59 minutes after Paulo Dybala stole possession from Tiemou Bakayoko and set him free down the right touchline",sport
"Alves now has four assists in this seasons Champions League, bettered only by Cristiano Ronaldo (five), Ousmane Dembl (six) and Neymar (eight), and in general, Wednesdays showing was very much the Alves of old, the man who provided Barcelona with a consistently potent attacking threat during their most golden years It was fair to wonder if the powers-that-be at the Camp Nou now regret allowing him to leave on a free transfer last summer",sport
"Alves had 72 touches of the ball against Monaco, utterly dominating their left-back Djibril Sidib  who, in fairness, was playing only because of an injury to Benjamin Mendy  and showing a level of defensive awareness that arguably has come about through being part of a side that believe the concession of a goal is an insult to their professional prideIn that regard this was another occasion when Juventuss entire rearguard shone, while ahead of them Dybala, Miralem Pjani, Claudio Marchisio and Higuan also caught the eye The visitors fully deserved their 2-0 victory, a staggering sixth consecutive Champions League clean sheet, and, before next weeks return in Turin, look on course to reach a second final in three years",sport
"For Alves an appearance at Cardiffs Millennium Stadium on 3 June would provide him with a chance to collect a fourth winners medal following his triumphs with Barcelona in 2009, 2011 and 2015 It would be some achievement and some ending to a season marked by a serious setback but which has ultimately shown that Alves has staying power to go with all that talentAntoine Griezmann has agreed a 280,000-a-week deal to play for Manchester United, according to one tabloid who says the Premier League side are ready to meet the 85m buy-out clause required to prise him away from Atltico Madrid The French striker has been a long-time target of United, despite his well documented reservations about the inclement weather in the north-west of England It is has also been suggested that his Basque wife, Erika, is not particularly keen on leaving Spain, but may change her mind upon being made aware of Manchesters myriad tourist attractions, including the Museum of Science and Industry, Gorton Monastery and Chorlton Water Park",sport

"These women were selected for the poll by MVP Index, a sports social media tracking firm co-founded by Jordan Spieths father, Shawn SpiethSponsor exemptions are always tricky business",sport
"One could certainly make the argument that more deserving players could have been selected as candidates for the exemption When I examined this poll, I did not see players who were undeserving, though What I saw was a completely unlevel playing field in terms of how many Twitter followers each of the ladies have: Nicollet with roughly 357,000, ONeal with 77,000 followers, Booth with 35,000 and Benavides with 7,000In addition to this poll, I saw a shameless attempt by the sponsors of the tournament to capitalize on the social media presence of female golfers without any regard to the false hope theyre setting in place for those with a smaller followingTake Benavides for example, who initially wrote in for a sponsor exemption",sport

"For Warren Deutrom, chief executive of Cricket Ireland, the mood is one of cautious optimism",sport
"Certainly while further tournament upsets have been achieved over the past decade since the wild celebrations in Jamaica on St Patricks Day in 2007, such as Kevin OBriens almighty felling of England in Bangalore in 2011 and the humbling of West Indies four years later, behind the scenes there have been building blocks put in place to make Irish cricket both a viable business and a more attractive career path for playersAlong with 30 staff, 19 central contracts that range from 20,000 to 70,000, an academy supported by a 10-year deal with the Irish-Indian conglomerate Shapoorji Pallonji, and participation figures that have quadrupled in four years to 52,000, is a semiprofessional domestic structure that from this year has firstclass and List A status Played by three provincial sides, it is intended to help bridge the gap between club and international cricket and perhaps one day both expand and retain the best Irish cricketersAchieving all this has been no mean feat, given an unpredictable fixture list not bound by the future tours programme  something that would be altered by Test status and the proposed 13-team ODI league  and the past inequality of world cricket The latter is summed up by the most honking statistic in the 2015 book Second XI by Peter Miller and Tim Wigmore that showed Ireland earned $56,000 for reaching the Super Eights of the 2007 World Cup, compared to $11m given to full members, and first-round duffers, Zimbabwe",sport
"Test status isnt about drawing down money from the ICC, Deutrom says It is about helping us achieve the bigger goal which, rather than seeking to make Ireland a major nation in cricket, is to make cricket a major sport in Ireland It will give us so much more profile and encourage boys and girls to take up the sport and maybe look to aim higher by pursuing a career that can see them travel the world",sport
"The timing of Irelands impending Test arrival brings with it a slight tinge of frustration, given the captain, William Porterfield, the OBrien brothers, Boyd Rankin (absent this week through injury) and Ed Joyce  their greatest runscorer  are into their 30s There is talent behind them  not least Paul Stirling, who will doubtless come out all guns blazing this week  but the sense is that with results in the limited-overs formats petering off since the last World Cup, the longest form of the game will be met by a side very much in transitionNiall OBrien, who made his debut in 2006 and is now 35, accepts this point but highlights a strong record in first-class cricket that has seen Ireland win four of the six editions of the ICC Intercontinental Cup, albeit having recently been replaced by Afghanistan at the top of the table after a crushing innings defeat in March",sport
"Ireland have of course had to deal with their best players seeking to further their careers overseas, with Joyce, Rankin and Eoin Morgan all pursuing international careers with England and only the first two returning since Test status, believes Deutrom, may not immediately stop such defection but it might give them pause for thought down the lineTest cricket is the primary thing cited in the past by players but it could be 20 years before we can match the payHe says: You would be fool to say no one will ever leave again but we have always taken the view that, rather than blame others, we should look in the mirror and say: Why dont we remove all of those reasons and make ourselves as aspirational for those players as possible?Test cricket is the primary thing cited in the past by players but it could be some will think it will be 20 years before we can match the pay And that is another mountain we must climb, so until then all we can do is look at what we can control and keep making playing for Ireland as attractive as possibleMorgan, who will captain England against Ireland for the third and fourth time this week, certainly offered Test cricket as his main reason for leaving the country of his birth in 2009, giving rise to the (perhaps fanciful) question of whether he may one day return to Irish colours, say once the 2019 World Cup is completed, for the end of his playing career",sport
"I actually could see that, Niall OBrien says Its not something Ive spoken to him about but after the Champions Trophy and the World Cup it may well be of interest to finish his career playing T20 leagues around the world and batting for Ireland in Test cricket Wed certainly love to have him at No4 make no mistake and Im sure the Irish public would love to see him wear the shamrock again",sport

"The Premier League, of course has less of a tradition in the US than it does in England, but she says: We can teach without being patronizing Im pretty proud of what weve done",sport
Lowe has earned high marks for her approach to the job,sport
"But she is still very much the networks face of the Premier League Asked if she felt like she was a de facto ambassador for English football in the US, she laughs and says: The Premier League is the product",sport
"I didnt know if it would be a good thing or a bad thing, she says",sport
"After she beat about 650 other applicants to win the search, she recalls a BBC employee referring to her fathers connection with the network and saying: Thank God you didnt tell us that They were actually kind of glad I didnt tell them",sport
"She was a football reporter for the BBC for five years, filing reports and features She was one of three network reporters at the 2006 World Cup in Germany",sport
"NBC Sports had announced in late 2012 that it had signed a three-year, $250m deal to televise Premier League games in English and Spanish beginning in the 2013-4 season",sport
"She and her husband had only got married in June 2013, with the NBC job requiring them to move to the United States Her husband stepped down as the manager of Luton Town and, Lowe says, was forced to start again from scratch He became the technical director at the Metropolitan Oval soccer academy in Queens, New York",sport
"Later, Buckle returned to England to coach Cheltenham Town, but his stay was brief and unsuccessful, so he returned to the US",sport
"One weekend every Premier League season, she does get to return to England for professional reasons, playing host to a version of the US broadcast, only from the side of the pitch, similar to NBCs NFL telecasts late in the season This years shows were televised from White Hart Lane, Old Trafford and the RiversideThe Manchester United-Chelsea match, with an 11am ET kickoff, drew nearly a million viewers in the US",sport

"Whatever happens to Anthony Joshua, life will never be the same for himFreshly crowned and adored after destroying Wladimir Klitschko in front of a vast TV audience in 140 countries, not to mention 90,000 paying customers at Wembley Stadium on Saturday night, the humble young champion has perhaps a decade of glory in front of him, with titles, adulation and impossible wealth the prizes as he strives to cash in on two powerful fists and a personality of disarming alacrity",sport
"By 2027 Joshua could be a retired billionaire or, if the fairytale sours, another disillusioned victim of the cruellest sport As it stands, all looks well for the smiling assassin who still lives at home with his mother in Golders Green",sport
"He once ran a stall at Wembley market, selling dodgy belts and sunglasses as his promoter Eddie Hearn put it You could buy Wembley market, Hearn jokes He could probably buy Wembley Stadium",sport
"But Joshua, at 27, has a wider vision and its sincerity is undeniable",sport
"I know for a fact there is some kid somewhere who has watched what Im doing and is, like I can do that Hell find himself in a gym and, somehow, hell go on and do better than what Ive done",sport
"Joshua wants to instil ambition into those who find his achievements inspiring Id never sit with the kids whove maybe had it tough and say: Look, stay where you are",sport
"If other, less discriminating money sharks are already circling for a piece of the champion, the man who owns two of the four main slices of the world heavyweight title, the IBF and WBA titles, is unsettlingly calmHe says he might fight Klitschko again, although the odds are lengthening, Deontay Wilder, the WBC champion, or the recuperating and suspended Tyson Fury, perhaps, who fumes and tweets thunderously off-stage",sport
"He thinks like he boxes: calculatingly The priceless ability to ride a crisis got him through a sixth-round knockdown that momentarily threatened to wreck the dream on Saturday night and he was there, revived, to finish the job with chilling efficiency five rounds later Those who might not have been watching before swivelled on their couches or have suddenly developed an interest in this engaging new heroAnd there is no escape for Joshua from the clutches of his gathering celebrity Dr Dre and Sir Elton John, rock royalty of different types and eras, spoke with him before the fight and he says: I was baffled",sport

"Simon Mottram, the chief executive of the cyclewear brand Rapha, is the cycling worlds equivalent of the fashion police, and a rush hour ride across London last week only reinforced his belief in the need for his upmarket gear The amount of people on bikes was amazing because it was a sunny morning but actually nine out of 10 looked absolutely appalling, he says Not only did they look terrible but the stuff they were wearing  He tails off muttering about sweaty high-vis jackets and the probable chafe caused by baggy shorts",sport
Over the past decade Raphas stock has risen sharply among fashion-aware cycling aficionados as gruelling long-distance road races and triathlons replace the golf course in the affections of mamils  a phrase coined by analysts at the research company Mintel as shorthand for middle-aged man in Lycra,sport
"Weve had to trade our way to success, says Mottram Weve got enough capital to keep growing the way we are growing but you are always thinking, could you go faster?Founded in the days before the crowdfunding campaigns that supported companies such as Brewdog, it took more than 200 meetings for the entrepreneur to secure startup cash for Rapha, with some of the pot drawn from friends and family who remain shareholders It resulted in an unusual set-up with Mottram owning just 125% and the remainder shared among a group that includes the private equity firm Active, which has 20%Fundraising was very difficult at the beginning because there was no obvious market and I had no track record of creating clothing or building an e-commerce business, says Mottram",sport
"Last year Rapha was said to be on the shopping list of Catterton, the private equity arm of the luxury goods group LVMH, which has since bought the Italian bike brand PinarelloWho would be the right backer for Rapha? Were not sure really, Mottram says",sport
"Like an overweight mamil, Raphas head office in a converted warehouse in north London is bursting at the seams, and an injection of new funds would presumably accelerate the search for larger premises",sport
"Rapha is by its nature a premium lifestyle brand with its clubhouses and holidays, says one industry executive with knowledge of the sector If I was Simon Id be looking for the support of a luxury brand or the private office of a wealthy family, who will let him carry on doing what hes doing, rather than a private equity firm There is a lot more mileage in the brand but there is a need to professionalise some aspects of the way it is run",sport

I understand and respect where the NRL was coming from with their decision Although it was difficult we understand where they were coming from at the timeRadradras former partner Perina Ting had accused him of punching her in the face in November 2014 and pushing her into a wall in 2015,sport

"The mere mention of Adelaide football club at the turn of the century is likely to prompt fearful thoughts: a marauding Darren Jarman tearing Jamie Shanahan limb from limb; Andrew McLeod and Mark Riciutto slicing through the midfield and onto the premiership dais; Malcolm Blight being brilliant instead of bonkers; Nigel Smart punching another spoil into row ZWhat we tend to forget is the bit immediately following the Crows 1997-98 premiership triumphs, when it all went pear-shaped very quickly  the part for which you have to consult AFL Tables Then you start to chuckle, and remember them plummeting their way down the ladder and into the Ayres era",sport
"In fairness, Adelaide basically came from nowhere to win both of those flags, so some kind of drop-off was understandable, but there was a big difference between looking down the spine of the ground and seeing Smart, Rod Jameson Shaun Rehn, Matthew Robran and Darren Jarman, and spying a team sheet containing names like Bryan Beinke, Ian Downsborough, David Gallagher, Darryl Wintle and Lucas Herbert",sport
"By the time the 1999 season had finished off Blights Adelaide coaching career, the Crows had gone from top of the pile to 13th and the barely any of their losses were unlucky; eight of them came with margins of six goals or greater, following a remarkable scoring drop-off of 27% Theyd rise again, of course, but not under Blight or his successorWere talking in relative terms here, but by 1974 St Kilda had featured in 10 finals series in the previous 14 years, which qualified the period as the clubs halcyon days",sport

Awarding Dejan Lovren a new four-year contract days after the centre-back was bullied by a striker (Christian Benteke) whom Klopp had deemed unsuitable for Liverpool (while Mamadou Sakho sat in the stands as an exiled Liverpool player) seemed the sort of idea that an internet troll might have suggested,sport

"Zaha has enjoyed his most productive top-flight season yet, with six goals and nine assists so far, having signed a new long-term contract at Selhurst Park only last year Palace, who are six points clear of the relegation zone with three games to play, have no desire to sell the 24-year-old and, once Premier League survival is achieved, intend to open talks over another deal to make him the highest paid player in the clubs history",sport
"They had, however, been braced for Spurs to revive interest first expressed last August when a bid of only 12m was dismissed out of hand by the Palace chairman, Steve Parish",sport
"Zaha, with Palaces blessing, successfully applied to Fifa towards the end of last year to represent the country of his birth He was duly absent for almost four weeks, departing after a home defeat to Swansea on 3 January, while competing for Ivory Coast at the Africa Cup of Nations in Gabon, where his team failed to emerge from the group stage The stunted nature of that campaign was considered a disappointment by the national set-up and, with that in mind, the Tottenham chairman, Daniel Levy, would need some persuading to table a club record bid for a player who could potentially be absent mid-season for up to six weeks every two years",sport
"Spurs current transfer record is the 30m paid to Newcastle United for Moussa Sissoko last summer, and they would have had to eclipse that amount considerably if Palace were ever to be persuaded into a sale",sport
"Emre Can was still smiling in disbelief as he attempted to piece together the moment which had thrust hopes of reaching the Champions League firmly back into Liverpools hands I saw the space and I ran in behind, he said, presumably referring to the area vacated by Adrian Mariappa who had been drawn forward sensing the true threat lay with Roberto Firmino",sport
"Can will never score a better goal than the scissor-kick which claimed the spoils in this corner of Hertfordshire His leap, almost balletic in its execution, was timed perfectly to meet Lucas Leivas pass",sport
"The Premier League may not have seen a better one this season, for all the eye-catching scorpion kicks and overheads which children have been attempting to mimic with glee in parks for months They have new inspiration for the summer That the scorer was a player who has been blunted at times by calf trouble this season, and whose contribution can be eclipsed by the more lavish forward thinkers in Liverpools ranks added to the drama",sport
"Can will go into the final 12 months of his contract at Anfield in July with talks over a new deal at an impasse and the player himself having suggested he would prefer to be playing a deeper-lying role in the side The real issue may be financial, though much more of this and he may be likelier to secure his wage demands than a change of positionLiverpool departed this arena with a place in next seasons Champions League still in their own hands",sport
"The visitors manager had actually made a beeline straight for Prdl, rather than Can, at the final whistle with nervous tension having long set in He had been aghast seconds earlier when Tom Cleverleys punt, and Stefan Okakas flick, had forced the loose ball on to the far post where the centre-half lurked to belt a shot on to the crossbar with Liverpools lives flashing before their eyes It was actually the hosts best opportunity of a night of frustration but it ensured the overriding sensation at the final whistle was one of intense relief in the away dugout",sport
"Klopp offered Prdl consolation through a smile before making his way into the corner towards the visiting support where all his frustration, pent up from the defeat by Palace, was released as he punched the air in celebration",sport
"His team merited this, for all Watfords exasperation at a flag-happy assistant referee Liverpool had overcome the early loss of Philippe Coutinho to a dead leg, sustained in a fourth-minute challenge with Mariappa, to find some rhythm amid the huff and puff with Adam Lallana restored to their ranks The England midfielder had had only two proper sessions and a recovery session, according to his manager, after five weeks out with thigh trouble, and yet his presence provided a level of reassurance",sport
"It had been Lallana who planted a volley from Gomess punch four minutes from the interval which looped back over the goalkeeper and the muddle of bodies in the box to strike the woodwork That superb effort would be trumped in what time remained before the breakThey were more assured once ahead, carrying a threat through Divock Origi and, late on, Daniel Sturridge with Gomes saving well from both, and they appeared to be repelling Watford with relative ease",sport

"Sal carried on but could take no more and was eventually withdrawn just before half-time In the dressing room he started to shake and then lost the feeling in his arms and legs, so he was taken to hospital by ambulance, accompanied by his terrified father",sport
"Sal has been vital in them getting this far, well beyond the goal at Leicester His role had changed, a shift more important still because of injuries to Thiago and Augusto Fernndez and the difficulties accommodating Koke centrallyAt Atltico they always knew Sal had talent; it is the tactical maturity that is striking",sport
"Waiting in the team hotel to embrace him and his father, Jos Antonio, when they arrived in Germany was the doctor who had operated on him Waiting at the stadium were the memories I remembered it all, he said",sport

"Changing a single factor may not have as much impact on overuse injuries, problems that can be caused by months, even years of microtrauma Making it more difficult to assign blame to teams is the fact that pitchers dont come to the big leagues with fresh ligaments and tendons By the time players make a major league roster, shoulders and elbows have already been stressed from throwing and hitting in high school, college and travel baseball",sport

"It will be tempting to portray this as a moment of baton-passing, power-shift and all the rest In reality the most striking aspect of a one-sided game was the ease with which Arsenal were beaten, how readily the stitches burst, a battle that was won in the preceding details over the last three years of contrasting surge and drive",sport
"Tottenham are a fearsome prospect at home, in every sense of the word On a balmy day in north London, this skintight ground with its rattly, touchline-close crowd seemed to nourish their aggression and drive Set against this relentlessly draining test of will and stamina there was a brutal clarity to Arsenals congealed status in the late-Wenger years, the end result a team without a centre, a sweet spot, an obvious functioning heart",sport
"By contrast Spurs, of course, have Alli and Kane",sport
"In Pochettinos hard-running system partnerships are once again key, not just tactically but in intangible things such as spirit and verve and will to win Alli and Kane do not just occupy the same areas; they carry this team forward from the front, embodying both that smothering style and the seductive youth and vigour of this group of maniacal workaholics",sport
"No matter, as he was there lurking in just the right place to smack the ball down and into the corner after fine work from Christian Eriksen, who wiggled in and out of the tiniest pocket to find a shot that was palmed out by Peter CechAt which point enter Kane, who thrives in these derbies and is now the first player to score in five of them in a row",sport

"He made it over the top of the final climb with an advantage of nine seconds and was unaware of that gap dropping to five seconds at one point as the team director, Roger Hammond, told him over the radio not to look back Fortunately for Pauwels, only Fraile could bridge over and the Spaniard was not about to deny his team-mate a first victory",sport

"A hat-trick of tries for their fit-again Wales and Lions No8, Taulupe Faletau, was the centrepiece of an increasingly assured team performance, a far cry from the Parisian horror show that cost them another date with Gloucester in Friday weeks Challenge Cup final Interestingly, too, it came after the director of rugby, Todd Blackadder, omitted his Lions centre Jonathan Joseph and picked Rhys Priestland to start at fly-half ahead of George FordIt may be too little, too late in terms of fourth place  Leicester will require only a losing bonus point at Worcester to trump a four-try Bath win at Sale  but Blackadder duly received the response he wanted from his squad after their loss of composure against Stade Franais",sport
"While he insisted afterwards that Joseph and the Leicester-bound Ford needed a rest after a bruising few weeks, he also made it clear the whole squad need to find more consistency if Bath want to become title winners again We want this club to be a top-four club every single year and, when we dont achieve that, questions have to be asked, he said We cant be happy with fifth or sixth every year, its not good enough",sport
"Gloucester, in contrast, still looked to be feeling the effects of their epic European semi-final victory at LaRochelle and David Humphreys, their director of rugby, made no attempt to deny their spectacular implosion from 10-8 down at half-time That 10-15 minutes after half-time was probably as bad as weve played in the last three years, said Humphreys, whose side can now qualify for next seasons Championss Cup only via the European playoffs which will also feature a Top14 side and two teams from the Pro12 It was embarrassing",sport
Television pictures also suggested his reserve hooker Motu Matuu was allowed to return to the field having been knocked cold early in the second half Humphreys said the player had successfully passed his head injury assessment and had been diagnosed as suffering a temporary stinger rather than anything more serious but the authorities may opt to review the footage,sport
"Happily Baths second-half display was rather more uplifting, even if the home sides win was a relative one Both these clubs have again trailed in behind Exeter and it is now four seasons since Gloucester finished above the Chiefs They could yet prove awkward opponents for Rob Baxters side at Kingsholm in Saturdays final round of the regular season but, as with Bath, they continue to be prone to huge fluctuations in form",sport

"Once they shook their heads clear, however, they were so dominant during the second half that, in the far corner, Arsenals fans could be seen heading away in droves long before the final whistle Once again, their team had come up short and another set of crowing supporters could be heard chanting we want you to stay in Wengers direction The Frenchman will almost certainly grant them their wish at a time when many of his own clubs supporters are campaigning for precisely the opposite",sport
"It could conceivably have been even worse if the referee, Michael Oliver, had not given Alexis Snchez the benefit of the doubt after a handball in the penalty area during the period of second-half pressure when the home side repeatedly threatened Petr Cechs goal and Wengers players seemed to be in the grip of a collective meltdown",sport
"By that stage Harry Kane had already scored one penalty, courtesy of Gabriels naive trip on the striker, and there were the telltale signs that Arsenal had reverted to all their bad habits: flimsy at the back, short of leadership and not enough players taking responsibility For Allis goal, there were half a dozen players in red and white shirts in proximity inside the penalty area Not one made a challenge as Christian Eriksen weaved past Nacho Monreal and Laurent Koscielny to create the first shooting opportunity The rebound fell to Alli and, again, the inaction of his opponents would have been staggering if this was not such a repetitive failure of Wengers sides in the modern eraTo begin with, Arsenal had looked reasonably competent, quick to the ball and hustling their opponents, with their front players under instructions not to allow Spurs to play out from the back",sport
"It was not until the second half, though, that Spurs started to play with the authority that comes from having not lost a league fixture on their own ground all season At 2-0, Vertonghen tried his luck again and Cech clawed away a curling shot that was heading towards the top corner",sport
To judge by the celebrations at the end the Chelsea players and fans think it is all over,sport
"The very best sides, it is often said, have a hundred different ways of winning a matchWhile this was billed as a showdown between Diego Costa and Romelu Lukaku, perhaps even as an audition for the latter in the event of Chelsea having to look around for a new striker in the summer, it turned out to be nothing of the sort The two leading scorers for their respective clubs both ended up having undistinguished games by their normal high standards",sport
"Lukaku in particular will be disappointed at drawing a blank at Goodison for the first time in 2017 when his former club were providing the opposition, while Costa wasted his only clear chance of the game in the first half and found opportunities limited because Eden Hazard was so closely watched by Idrissa GueyeThe Everton midfielder had obviously been told to stick like glue to Chelseas main attacking inspiration and he took the instruction so literally it was hard to believe he lasted until the 78th minute before picking up a booking, so often did he succeed in pulling the Chelsea man to the floorWithout penetration from Costa or Hazard the visitors were struggling to make their superiority count for over an hour until the deadlock was broken by a player who has just gone eight games without a goal One would never have guessed from the authority with which Pedro found the target from outside the area and suddenly Evertons eight home wins on the bounce and Ronald Koemans slightly rash boast that only Barcelona have scored more goals at home this season began to look inadequateWe did a good job until Pedro put us behind but Chelsea have the ability to win games even when they are not playing at their highest level, Koeman said, neatly summing up what separates champions from the rest",sport
"We are having a great season, Conte said, a little unnecessarily Pedro is having a fantastic season but dont forget he used to play for Barcelona, so perhaps we should expect goals of that quality Hes a great player",sport
"Few would disagree, though Pedro was finding game time difficult to come by before Contes arrival at Stamford BridgeNow it is Willian who is missing out yet even in the few minutes he was allowed, the Brazilian scored another goal to add to the couple he managed at Wembley last week, and right at the end he missed a good chance to put Chelsea four upIt is not easy leaving such good players out, Conte said, with reference to Willian and Cesc Fbregas He seems to have found a way to manage it, though, as champion coaches generally do Conte was generous to his beaten opponents, he knew they had put together eight straight wins at Goodison and even complimented Everton on the success of their gameplan",sport

"If that could be an epitaph for Boros season, Agnews players were not minded to surrender Closing City down industriously, concentrating assiduously and winning their fair share of tackles, they ensured Guardiola had more than the capriciously swirling wind to worry aboutPersistent gusts left the tail of City managers long black, designer-cut raincoat flapping almost as frantically as his arms With his side yet to test Brad Guzan, he had genuine reason for anxiety It proved justified when Negredo gave Boro the lead against his former club",sport
"Initially this infusion of pace and width had limited effect: despite City monopolising possession and attacking in numbers, Boro held creditably firm until Kevin Friend awarded that controversial penaltyBursting into the box at speed, San accelerated into Marten de Roon, who looked to be merely standing his ground, before the winger collapsed dramatically Given that there was clearly contact, possibly exaggerated by San conveniently leaving a leg trailing behind him, the referees decision seemed understandable but it was hard to see what the midfielder could have done to avoid it",sport

"Chelsea carried their customary, incisive threat on the counterattack but their final delivery often undermined the quality of their approach work Their rhythm may have been disrupted by knocks to Costa and Hazard inside the opening 20 minutes, the former left feeling his knee following a committed but clean tackle by the excellent Tom Davies, the latter after colliding with the advertising hoardings, but Koemans tactics were also a factor",sport
Gueye shadowed Hazards every step as the Everton manager paid the Belgium international the compliment his abilities have merited this season,sport
"Job done, Hazard was replaced by Willian with five minutes remaining and the Brazilian sealed what was ultimately a comfortable win seconds later Costa released Fbregas to the byline and the midfielder cut the ball back perfectly for Willian to beat Stekelenburg with a routine finish",sport
"And then, somehow, the main event managed to exceed the ample hype that preceded it By the time Joshua detonated that right uppercut from hells heart on Klitschkos chin in the 11th round, the largest crowd for a boxing match in Britain since before the second world war had been whipped into a white-hot wall of sound",sport
"This was an event that only the United Kingdom could engender, and never more so than today in the thick of a golden age for British boxing, underwritten by the nations 11 current world champions It was a masterstroke of promotion and event production helmed by Eddie Hearn, the 37yearold architect behind Joshuas rise And if the early returns on the record-breaking pay-per-view numbers claimed by the Matchroom Sport group managing director are accurate, it raises the question: why ever would Joshua fight anywhere else?For decades Las Vegas has represented boxings most aspirational and coveted platform  where the worlds best fighters contest for the richest purses against a glitzy backdrop of plunging necklines and immaculately tailored suits",sport
"Perhaps the most lucrative near-term fight for Joshua is a unification bout with Deontay Wilder, the undefeated American knockout machine who holds the WBC title (and who observed from ringside on Saturday as a member of Skys commentary team) But the Alabamans domestic profile hardly scratches the surface of Joshuas in England",sport
"Joshua had already owned the IBFs version of the fractured heavyweight title by virtue of last years knockout of someone named Charles Martin, a well-meaning Californian who himself had claimed it when his opponent was injured on a slip early in their match for the vacant belt But Saturdays gut-check moment was the night when Joshua truly became a world champion",sport
"The sports flagship division has long served as a bellwether for the popularity of prize-fighting at large As the heavyweights go, they say, so does boxing Joshuas emergence may signal the dawn of an exciting new era in the weight class  with a bevy of tantalising matchups to be made involving Wilder, Luis Ortiz, Joseph Parker, Andy Ruiz and, lest we forget, the lineal champion in Tyson Fury",sport
"Anthony Joshua is about to embark on what he calls phase three of his journey and, whatever his repeated declarations that he is in boxing for fun not money, over the next decade he could bank as much as 500m, drawing him alongside Floyd Mayweather as the biggest earner in the history of his precarious sportAfter his dramatic late stoppage of Wladimir Klitschko in front of 90,000 fans at Wembley on Saturday night, all things seem possible for the young heavyweight champion, now indisputably the worlds best Afterwards in the bowels of the national stadium, the 27-year-old was unnervingly cool about his precocious achievement and what awaits him",sport
"After getting up in the sixth and battering the long-time dominator of the division into unwilling submission 35 seconds from the end of the 11th, the one-time street boy from Watford, who still lives at home with his mother and prides himself on staying close to his roots, owns the IBF and IBO titles, as well as the WBAs super version These are bargaining chips he can use to dominate the division and the sport for as long as he remains undefeatedHis manager, Eddie Hearn, told the Guardian: I spoke to him in camp three weeks ago and he said: Yeah, I want 10 more years of this We might run out of opponents But there are so many different boxes to tick",sport
Were only going to box twice a year now,sport
Hell have a nice two or three months off now I dont think hell box again until between September and December Its more likely to be at the Millennium Stadium  if its in the UK We cant return to the O2 and Manchester Arena Thats why we might take it to another territory,sport
"Weve probably just completed phase two [of the career strategy] There are four phases: one, he won the title, two he unified the heavyweight championship of the worldI cant tell you his expectations and what he wants to achieve  not just in boxing, but outside of boxing, as a person and as a fighter So, that was like winning the world heavyweight championship tonight, to beat Wladimir Klitschko to unify the title  in his 19th professional fightPhase three is all about the big heavyweight championship fights",sport
"Not many fighters would have got up from the leveller Joshua shipped in the sixth but, after cleverly husbanding his resources  and aided by Klitschkos innate caution  he worked his way back into the contest to finish the jobAn uppercut, which he had used to good effect all night, stunned Klitschko at the start of the 11th and Joshua hunted him relentlessly He put him down in his own corner, decked him with a left hook along the ropes and then battered him to a standing halt just above his own trainer, Robert McCracken",sport
"The trainer has been with him through most of his journey, amateur and pro",sport
"Its just great to see a British heavyweight like Anthony come through I sat here after Carl Froch boxed George Groves three years ago, and it was memorable tonight",sport

"Nerveless at the death in the Russian Grand Prix, Valtteri Bottas finally proved that Formula One has a new iceman The promise he has long shown was given full rein in a competitive car at Sochi and exploited with almost complete precision",sport
"When I drive there is not much emotion in there, he said Im just trying to get everything right and get every lap, every corner perfect",sport
"He was a hugely popular winner, congratulated immediately by his team-mate Lewis Hamilton and Vettel, who was sporting in defeat Hes done a superb job, its his day and he deserves to win because he drove better than all the rest of us, said the German",sport
"On a one-year contract with Mercedes, Bottas has a lot to prove this season if he is to be retained and this was the best possible case he could make to do so Drafted in at short notice to replace Nico Rosberg in the close season, he has had to come up to speed at the team fast His previous best results were two second places at the British and German Grands Prix in 2014 for Williams, while a spin behind the safety car in Shanghai raised questions about whether, now in a championship-contending car, he could make the step up",sport
"It was a very tough weekend, I just wasnt quick enough, he said",sport
"That he could do so was evident early on, having nailed the restart after an early safety car and he led into the pit stops",sport
"There was this strange opportunity for me that happened in the winter that made this possible, said Bottas",sport

Whats key is that this has got to be the start of something building the club back up again,sport
"If unity has been an integral component, so too has quality at crucial junctures and goals from Jem Karacan, David Wheater and Adam le Fondre  a trio with Premier League experience  confirmed that a decline that began with relegation from the top flight five years ago has been haltedThe goalscorers are among a clutch of Wanderers players out of contract in June Securing their futures will be on the agenda for Parkinson, although chairman Ken Anderson will have other business to attend to first",sport
"For the second, eight minutes after the restart, Wheater nodded in from LeFondres headed assist",sport
"Rooney needlessly barged Jordan Ayew for the 79th-minute free-kick that Sigurdsson curled into the top right-hand corner It left David de Gea stationary, the goalkeeper perhaps confused by Ander Herrera, who ran back from the wall on to the line and then out again",sport
"Marcus Rashford may also be the subject of much discussion after his fall for Rooneys 45th-minute spot-kick came when he looked for contact with the Swansea City goalkeeper Lukasz FabianskiManchester City later drew at Middlesbrough, doubling the frustration for Mourinho as United stay in fifth place and a point behind on 65 points, with Liverpool level with Pep Guardiolas side Arsenal remain five points behind United after Sundays 2-0 defeat by Tottenham Hotspur, though they have a game in hand",sport
"Because we play the League Cup final, and then you have to play the [rearranged] game midweek",sport
"It was a blessing that we didnt play the FA Cup semi-final but we go to the same problem, you are punished for doing well and if we beat Celta, we have the final on the Wednesday and we play against Crystal Palace on the Sunday, he said We play Southampton two days before So again maybe this result is also a blessing because maybe I can bring Nicky Butt [the academy director] and his team to play against Crystal Palace and hopefully Crystal Palace doesnt need a game to stay in the division because it would be very bad if they needed the points for us to play with the under-23s",sport
"If Rooneys 252nd goal for the club cheered Mourinho what happened before and after would not have done Shaw was forced off after eight minutes and Bailly just before the hour, each with leg injuries",sport
"Paul Clements side, who showed one change with Ki Sung-yeung coming in for Leroy Fer, went close to an early goal Ayew slipped into a gap left by Bailly but his shot was blocked by the French defender, whose attempted clearance ricocheted off Sigurdsson and the ball rolled to safetyUniteds dubious penalty was awarded when Rashford went down going past Fabianski, who kept his hands close to his body",sport
Within hours of becoming Sunderlands manager last July David Moyes boarded a privately chartered plane He and the team were bound for a French training camp but an ominous grinding noise from the engines and slightly tense looks exchanged among the cabin crew soon confirmed they would be making a detour,sport
"Engine failure had prompted an awkward emergency landing With the benefit of hindsight, it seemed an ominously emblematic portent of an impending season destined to conclude with the club bumping down hard into the Championship and Moyess carefully burnished reputation in ruins",sport
"The harbingers of trouble ahead did not end there About to touch down at a small Austrian airport before a pre-season friendly, Sunderlands plane subsequently endured a further drama",sport
"If, off the pitch, his observations that two of his African players, Papy Djilobodji and Didier Ndong, required more Britishness in their football jarred, on it, Sunderlands tactics have frequently seemed somewhat binary for a division filled with kaleidoscopic positional rotation and ever shifting systems",sport
"The impression this may be a man stuck in his ways and reluctant to challenge received wisdoms was reinforced when Moyes claimed teams dont win things with back threesFurther question marks appeared when a manager who spent 30m last summer set about signing several players he had previously worked with at Everton and Manchester United, including Victor Anichebe and the United loanee Adnan JanuzajHaving failed properly to address the squads chronic lack of pace and creativity, Sunderlands seventh manager in five turbulent years consistently sidelined the gifted Wahbi Khazri, a playmaking success under Sam Allardyce last springSunderland fans cannot comprehend why Allardyces successor failed to acquire the former France midfielder Yann MVila, outstanding on loan last season, and available for 7m from Rubin Kazan, but Moyes was fast discovering that, to echo Kevin Keegan, the job wasnt like it said in the brochureIf he possibly did not fight hard enough for MVila, Sunderlands dismal recent performances should be assessed in the context of some significant managerial mitigating factors",sport
"Last July Moyes was unaware that Ellis Short, the owner and a man initially delighted to secure the Scots services at the fifth attempt, hoped to sell the club Neither did he appreciate the scale of the debt  currently 110m with wages representing an alarming 78% of turnoverAfter a series of gruelling relegation battles Sunderland were an established bottom-five Premier League club shouldering a top-10 wage bill Had Allardyce, highly impressive on Wearside last season when his sports science regimen raised fitness levels dramatically, not been lured away to, very briefly, coach England, he may conceivably have broken this cycle of struggle Yet well before his departure the current Crystal Palace managers relationship with Short had become severely strained, with the transfer budget a sore point",sport
Privately Moyes  who considered resigning last autumn  feels similarly let down,sport
"Whoever is in charge next season will preside over radical change in an unforgiving Championship With nine senior professionals, including Jan Kirchhoff, John OShea and Seb Larsson, out of contract in June a squad overhaul beckons",sport
"A clause in Jermain Defoes contract permits the England striker to depart for free but Jordan Pickfords excellent goalkeeping, featuring some brilliant footwork, will prompt a high-price transfer and the centre-half Lamine Kon should also command a decent feeTalented as that trio are few disagree with Moyess oft-repeated assertion that, collectively, the squad is limited",sport
"The suspicion is that, somewhere between Stretford and San Sebastin he had lost his old drive, with a certain misplaced complacency filling the gapBy Saturday evening shock set in as a suddenly chastened manager, his voice barely audible, said sorry to Sunderland fans before explaining he would meet Short and resolve his future in the coming daysIts not nice and I feel worse because Ive let people down; thats the disappointment, said Moyes",sport
"That concluded a slightly awkward finale to one of sports longest preambles As the big moment neared the stadium filled, and as the fans grew in number so the music they were subjected to grew in volume",sport
I think I should have done more straight after he went down,sport
"Yet the fight was close enough to make Klitschko mull over the possibility of carrying on, at least in the early hours of Sunday morning Ill take my time over deciding what happens next, he admitted Right now I wont make any decisionsI think Joshua and I both did great I think we did a lot for the sport in the way we performed and how we respected and treated each other",sport
"If Klitschko does decide it is time to retire, it will be with an impressive professional record of 64 wins in his 69 fights Impressively he had his best years in his 30s",sport
"Unsurprisingly he was classy to the end  despite the obvious frustrations of coming within a big right hand of regaining his title I have always been a fan of AJs talent, he said, his voice tinged with a certain sadness",sport
"From the moment the final blows of a magnificent fight rippled down Anthony Joshuas 27-year-old arms on to the bleeding and battered head of the 41-year-old Wladimir Klitschko in the 11th round, there could be no more arguments about who is the best heavyweight in the worldIt was not just that Joshua, unbeaten in all 19 professional fights, had added the WBA super version of the title to his own IBF belt, or even that he had stopped one of boxings finest old champions What secured the winners acclaim, surely, by everyone but the WBC champion, Deontay Wilder (who sat ringside) was that he got up from a right cross in the sixth that would have felled an elephant",sport
"There was little in it as they came out for the 11th round Klitschko, perhaps, had an edge, using every trick garnered over 68 fights, 29 of them as champion in an 11-year stretch, to bring anxiety to his young opponents work That changed in the crack of a single uppercut to the Ukrainians jaw, which all but toppled him A left hook and a grazing right put him down for a count in his own corner and Joshua went for the kill, calmly and with fixed purpose He sent him over like a dead tree with a left hook, yet somehow Klitschko got up for more",sport
"When Joshua moved in with rapacious instincts to let loose that volley of pain in his own corner, his trainer, Robert McCracken, was screaming himself hoarse  along with the rest of the stadiumJoshua celebrated in the ring with a message that sounded like a recruiting call for all the lost youth he likes to represent: If you dont take part, you fail Boxing is about character There is nowhere to hide No complications about boxing",sport
"The challenger opened the fourth with a long right that caught Joshua off-guard, before settling back into his counterpunchers rhythm",sport
"The fight properly came to life in the fifth Joshua, stirred after being shaken, hammered Klitschko with a welter of rights and lefts and sent him down at his feet for a count",sport
"The only bells ringing for Klitschko, however, were those in his head in the 11th, probably the most horrendous of his long and garlanded career He was a proud not bitter loser, a champion to the end",sport
"Asked while his head was still spinning if he would contemplate a rematch, he said, quite reasonably: Of course Im interested but first Ive got to work out what the hell happenedWhat happened was he lost to a fighter who can now fairly claim to be the biggest star in the business Not that he would, mind",sport
"Luke Campbell is only a signature away from a world title fight with the outstanding WBA lightweight champion, Jorge Linares, after a convincing ninth-round stoppage of Darleys Prez on Saturday night",sport
"Linares, who has checked the world title ambitions of Kevin Mitchell and Anthony Crolla, will provide another level altogether for Campbell, who has had five good wins since his only defeat in 18 paid bouts, against Yvan Mendy in 2015This undercard fight was a classic cat-and-mouse affair between two skilful and quick-fisted boxers, Campbells educated southpaw style interlocking with the that of the orthodox Prez with surprising smoothness",sport
"The Colombian, who boxed a close draw then lost to Crolla, arrived at only three weeks notice and did not make the 9st 9lb limit, however, so was boxing for the purse and pride The latter remained intact until he turned away in pain after throwing a half-jab, clutching his left arm, and was retired in the eighthAnother garlanded Olympic champion, Katie Taylor, one of the outstanding amateurs of her time and a beacon for womens boxing, looks more like a professional with every fight and edged closer to a world title when she imposed a seventh-round stoppage on her fifth opponent, the unbeaten Nina Meinke",sport

"Hawera got a chance three minutes into the second half and kicked truly to shave the deficit to two He put them in front with his third penalty after 51 minutes, as the Brumbies refused to fold but it didnt take the men from Auckland long to regain the lead and a well-worked lineout allowed Akira Ioane to drive over for a try and make it 13-8",sport
Bryn Gatland missed the conversion and the Brumbies began to apply pressure on the Blues defence That culminated in Haweras fourth goal bringing them within one point with 20 minutes remaining,sport

"Another first is that England are playing an international when three of their key cricketers are engaged in the Indian Premier League Jos Buttler, Ben Stokes and Chris Woakes have started to make their mark in the IPL in recent days and they will be gaining from the experience So this is not a strategy which should be automatically denigrated Their absence allows Ben Duckett and Steve Finn to be in the 14-man squad for the Ireland games, though they have not been selected in the 15 for three matches against South Africa and the subsequent Champions TrophyEoin Morgan and Jason Roy have also been in India but have played only six IPL matches between them",sport

"That standards are being set in London rather than Manchester was painfully evident at the Etihad, where City and United in effect found themselves fighting over the crumbs left from the top table Pep Guardiola and Jos Mourinho had to put a brave face on even being associated with such an unedifying shambles and the latter did not do himself or his club any favours with the ridiculous suggestion that Marouane Fellaini might have been harshly treated because he did not break Sergio Ageros nose or hurt him badly enough to prevent him smiling in the tunnelAt least Guardiola, peering through the gloom of an underwhelming end to Citys season, could find something worth smiling about He had hoped to have Gabriel Jesus back for the key games at the end of the campaign  the FA Cup final, maybe Bringing him on for the last few minutes against United was an acknowledgment that there are not really going to be any key games now, at least none worth saving him for, and when the Brazilian immediately found the net with a header from a slightly offside position there was even the suggestion Guardiola should have sent him on earlier",sport
"He has an instinct in the box, Guardiola said, all too aware that apart from Agero few other City players display the same trait When he played his first game against Tottenham [in January] he made an impact in eight minutes Against United, after three months out, he finds two chances in five minutes, one goal disallowed by centimetres",sport
"He is dynamic and aggressive in the penalty area, his influence on his other team-mates is huge, and we are so happy to have him back He could not play any more minutes on his return than he did because he only had two full training sessions in three months, but he is physically strong and I am pretty sure he is going to help us until the end of the season",sport
"That does not necessarily mean the 20-year-old will find himself in the starting lineup at Middlesbrough on Sunday Guardiola still believes he should be brought back gradually, and he does not want to take unnecessary risks against a side fighting for Premier League survivalWeve just had two tough games in a week, including extra time against Arsenal, and the players are tired, Guardiola said",sport
"There, if you like, is a useful synopsis of Citys season All the dreams and ambition in the world at the start, by the end reduced to worrying about picking up enough points from Middlesbrough, West Brom and Watford It is a familiar enough routine at the club, and one that importing a top-drawer manager does not seem to have greatly altered, though Vincent Kompany, a captain now also happily recovered from injury, believes he can see encouraging signs",sport
"We have not been getting the results we deserve after dominating so many games this season, but if you ask me we are not far off having the real deal here, he said",sport
"City have three home games left of their five to play, do not face any top-six opponents and should manage a top-four place as long as Agero and Jesus remain available",sport
"Uniteds point at the Etihad was significant in that it places top-four qualification in their own hands  if they win all their remaining games there will be nothing Liverpool can do to overhaul them  though as they still have to travel to Arsenal and Spurs it is by no means certain that Mourinhos draw specialists will win all their remaining gamesFellainis absence through suspension leaves Mourinho short in midfield, though, given he will still be available in Europe, not as short as all that",sport
"The issue for both Manchester teams in what has been a disappointing season for the north-west as a whole, is the amount of fight left in Liverpool With four winnable games between now and the end of the season, they ought to be looking at maximum points to make sure United have to do their utmost to sneak past them Yet Liverpool appear to be running out of steam at the wrong time and after losing ground at home to Crystal Palace last week nothing can be taken for grantedThe only certainty, whoever makes it into the final top four, is that the London clubs will remain firmly on top The northern powerhouse, in football as in geopolitics, is still a concept waiting to gain traction",sport

"Woods, who has a regular spot on Fox Sports NRL 360 show, has been the face of the Tigers through the recent troubled times and he has paid a price for it at times as his much-publicised contract situation played out He has been targeted with boos from some disgruntled Tigers fans and one pointed banner on the hill at Leichhardt Oval during Saturays 22-16 loss to Crobulla read Woods is a Dog",sport

"There is the suggestion of having more individuals who serve on both boards simultaneously Then theres the economic rationalism of the Winning Edge strategy, which prioritises money to those sports more likely to produce medals",sport
"These are some of the areas that Coates was right to slap down in his return letter My difficulty with [Winning Edge] he wrote, is that the AOC executive has a fiduciary duty to support and hopefully effect the Olympic representation and participation of all 40 of our national member federations As for the AOC becoming more entwined with government, this naturally means its objectives can be compromised by the partisan demands of the day",sport
"Of course when it comes to public image  such as avoiding a repeat of the chef de mission missteps in Rio  that wouldnt be such an issue if the AOC was more accountable, or its president more able to be swayed So the dilemma continues, with Coates having proved unable to contain himself when his province was threatened His sense of self, his power, the perks they entail, are all on the line, including his IOC position that he has waited so many years to attain",sport

"Andy Murrays chequered start to life as the worlds top player continued with a first defeat to Dominic Thiem, the talented ninth-ranked Austrian, in the semi-finals of the Barcelona OpenMurray, still feeling his way back on to the Tour after more than a month on the sidelines with an elbow injury, was beaten 6-2, 3-6, 6-4 in two hours and 13 minutes",sport
"As in the previous round against Albert Ramos-Violas, his surprise conqueror in Monte Carlo, Murray quickly fell behind He dropped serve in the opening game, a tentative drop shot perhaps betraying early doubts in the face of some ferocious hitting from Thiem, and the setback set the tone for the remainder of the set The Austrians superior confidence, power and movement earned him two further breaks and, although Murray clawed back the first courtesy of a Thiem double-fault, he rarely looked comfortable",sport
"The Scot sportingly conceded the opening set when another thumping Thiem drive, mistakenly called long, sent him scrambling fruitlessly to his forehand corner",sport
"The second of Thiems two missed chances, which came and went when he lashed a forehand long, seemed to afford Murray a significant boost as he sought to make it three wins in three Lingering disappointment appeared the only explanation for the glaring errors that followed, the Austrian missing a sitter at deuce in the next game before screwing a forehand wideServing with greater bite and consistency than he had in the opener, when barely half his first deliveries found the court and he won just 17% of the points behind his second, Murray quickly evened the contest",sport
So it proved Thiem rediscovered his early form to move a break ahead and although Murray levelled the match at 4-4 the 23-year-old was not to be denied,sport

"There were two summer Lions on the field, but only for 20 minutes",sport
"The Northampton director of rugby, Jim Mallinder, said he hoped Lawes, who also injured his shoulder in the challenge, would be fit for Saturdays final match of the season at home to Harlequins It will be a battle for a Champions Cup slot, even though this was the Saints 12th league defeat of the season Unable to arrest Exeters flow in a match in which the penalty count was low, it became a matter of how long they would hold out",sport
The answer was 26 minutes,sport
"It took Exeter two minutes to extend their 12-7 interval lead Ian Whitten picked up a loose pass and ran outside the second-row David Ribbans whose tackle was a symptom of his sides growing fatigue Nowells try was reward for his persistence  the home sides back three carrying the ball for more than 400 metres between them, rarely receiving the ball in their designated positions",sport
"The replacement centre Sam Hill scored Exeters fifth try and Woodburn received Nowells pass for his 10th in the Premiership this season  proof of Exeters ability to take players from other clubs and turn them from journeymen to assets  before the Saints full-back Ahsee Tuala, whose enthusiasm for tackling waned as the match went on, finished the scoring by sneaking in on the left wing",sport
"In arguably their worst performance of the season, despite naming a starting XV who included five of their six Lions, Saracens stumbled their way past the bottom side, who led 9-3 at half-time, with two tries from their replacement tighthead and one apiece from Chris Ashton and Nick Tompkins Saracens, for whom Kelly Brown and Neil de Kock were making their final appearances, remain third but now go to Wasps on the final day of the season, only two points behind Dai Youngs side and Exeter, who are level on 79The Saracens director of rugby, Mark McCall, will rest a number of players against Wasps with an eye on the Champions Cup final and rejected the idea the team-bonding trip to Barcelona after beating Munster last weekend was to blame for their poor showing",sport
"It was a really disappointing performance, said McCall, who also confirmed Mako Vunipola was fine after a knock to his troublesome left knee Weve got certain standards, give Bristol some credit, but we fell well short of those But you mustnt try to say that whats happened this afternoon was because of Barcelona We had a good training week, we just played poorlyAshton thought he had scored the opening try on 23 minutes  not for the first time a Bristol grubber kick was blocked, allowing the Saracens wing to hack ahead and beat Gavin Henson to the ball, only to be hauled back for offside",sport
"Henson has endured his fair share of ill-fated spells at various clubs throughout his career but his stint at Saracens, when he started a solitary match, was particularly forgettable A second penalty from his booming right boot put Bristol 6-0 to the good and it is hard not to think what may have been had the 35-year-old stayed injury-free this season",sport
"Henson and Owen Farrell, who had earlier missed a routine kick at goal, traded penalties before half-time and six minutes after the restart Ashton had his 14th try in as many matches and 75th for the club  gathering his measured kick down the right touchline after a break from Tompkins Farrell converted to edge Saracens aheadIf that was an ominous score for Bristol it took Saracens another 10 minutes to score their second try  Du Plessis shoved over from a lineout drive, shortly after coming off the bench",sport

"Southgate, who had swerved the Manchester derby to watch rugby league on Thursday, will have been encouraged by Butlands performance ahead of Englands games with Scotland and France in June, and Hughes knows his ambition is to be his countrys No1 again",sport
"When you have got dominance, sometimes the opposition can break and make chances, and you need a top-class keeper to make match-defining saves, and that is what Jack did, said the Stoke manager after the stalemate at the bet365 StadiumAll top clubs need keepers like Jack There have been a couple of false dawns",sport
"Jack enjoys the England setup He had just broken in at senior level, but first things first  we are just two games into his return",sport
"We were caught out just prior to the start of the season, when he broke down again Clearly his ambition is to be the No1 keeper for England",sport
"The draw moved Stoke up to the 40-point mark in the Premier League, while West Ham are only one away from such a figure after a game in which they needed Adrins brilliant one-handed save to deny Saido Berahino a maiden Stoke goal, and his first for anyone in 427 days",sport
"Berahinos barren spell has not stopped Stokes supporters warming to the striker and his luckless start to life in Staffordshire was summed up when he lost this footing as Xherdan Shaqiri looked to play him throughAnother block, this time from Jos Fonte, prevented him from converting Joe Allens cross, while the former Southampton captain was equally alert to stop Marko Arnautovic turning home Glen Johnsons pull acrossThe Hammers lacked creativity outside of Lanzini, but Ayew did display some ingenuity with an overhead kick that provided Butland with his first test",sport
"West Ham are eight points above the drop zone, though that margin could be trimmed to five again if Swansea win away to Manchester United on Sunday, and their manager, Slaven Bilic, is not prepared to declare safety as a certainty ahead of contests with Tottenham, Liverpool and Burnley",sport
"We need more points, it may be enough, Bilic said We dont want to come into the last game of the season with the radio on and keep asking what is the score there? We would love to avoid it",sport
"We are not panicking, but we are not safe Nine points to play for We need more pointsThe Premier League champions can finally breathe more easily as any lingering relegation fears were put to bed on an afternoon when Jamie Vardy continued his resurgence under Craig Shakespeare to score the only goal of a game that rarely came to lifeIt was Vardys 15th of the season in all competitions and his eighth in 12 matches under Shakespeare  a run of form that has been central to propelling Leicester from the lower reaches of the table to 11th place",sport
"It was a scrappy game throughout, low on quality and riddled with mistakes, one of which led to Vardys goal Salomon Rondon, who has failed to score since December, gifted possession to Shinji Okazaki with a loose pass and Albion, normally so tight and compact, were suddenly wide open Okazaki fed Vardy and the English international did the rest with the minimum of fuss, sweeping a right-footed shot from just inside the area beyond Ben Foster",sport
Until that point neither side had offered much in a fractious game that had threatened to boil over on a couple of occasions Danny Drinkwater picked up a booking for a full-blooded challenge on Nacer Chadli  when Mark Clattenburg quickly reached for his pocket it was tempting to think that the referee was going to brandish a red card,sport
"Leicester came close to scoring a second early in the second half Vardy once again was involved, escaping in the left channel before sliding a low centre across the six-yard box and behind the Albion defence",sport
"Albion, in contrast, looked flat, one-paced and devoid of ideas Pulis responded by bringing on Darren Fletcher and James McClean in the second half to try to lift his team",sport
"Craig Gardner smashed home the clinching penalty, 14 minutes from time, showing Lukas Jutkiewicz how it is done, and Redknapp took it all in his stride, strolling on to the pitch at the end to applaud the impassioned capacity crowd, but knows the job still needs seeing throughNext Sunday, starting two points safe but with an inferior goal difference, Birmingham must match the results of Blackburn, away to Brentford, and Nottingham Forest, hosting Ipswich, to avoid relegation",sport
"Birmingham, even with 10 men, looked well organised and confident Weve encouraged them, he said",sport
"Birmingham could have been forgiven for melting Instead, they dug in with resilience and four minutes before the interval found their rewardCraig Gardners initial corner was returned to him and from his second cross Ryan Shotton headed back across goal for Grounds to run in bravely and head in at the far postGrounds was booked for time-wasting  in the 64th minute But when Gardner smashed home his penalty after Dean Whitehead tripped Jacques Maghoma, Birmingham knew they remained in control of their own Championship destiny",sport
The wait for an away win under Marco Silva goes on but this felt every inch like one as Hull City garnered another priceless point in their fight for Premier League survival,sport
"There were few positives to pinpoint for Southampton but Soaress whipped ball caused a moments panic in the Hull back line only for Andrea Ranocchia to ease his countryman Manolo Gabbiadini aside, allowing Jakupovic to collectSouthampton were tedious in their approach, guilty of overplaying at times and repeatedly second best",sport
"Southamptons uninspiring performance was summed up by second-half miscommunication between Long and Redmond, with the confusion resulting in Hull moving up the pitch and earning a free-kick Saints had a couple of half-chances with Davis and Tadic volleying high and wide, but were left shortchanged by a resilient defence, led by Harry Maguire, who was again outstanding",sport
"Hulls early attacking promise faded a little but they continued to run themselves into the ground Sometimes, though, it was not enough, as when Longs pace left Ranocchia in a spin, forcing his partner, Maguire, to clear the danger Maguire then threw himself in front of the ball to deny Long a simple finish",sport
Southampton had suddenly come alive Tadic forced Jakupovic into another smart stop but his party piece was still to come,sport
"After the bleakest and least imaginative of campaigns punctuated by one-dimensional tactics and inadequate recruitment, it was the least the former Everton, Manchester United and Real Sociedad coach could expect Yet much as Moyes has failed to impress, many of the clubs manifold problems are rooted in the boardroom where Ellis Short, the owner, should not escape blameGiven his clubs dramatically superior fanbase and infrastructure  not to mention top-10 wage bill  Short should be ashamed Bournemouth are safely in mid-table while Sunderland supporters contemplate an uncertain future",sport
"Admittedly Fabio Borinis viciously swerving shot forced Artur Boruc into a good save but King, who has scored more goals than Sunderland during 2017, missed four first-half chances as his side monopolised possessionIf Bournemouth were playing a three-dimensional, high-definition passing game, Sunderlands tactics seemed from the analogue age and principally featured the ball being pumped in Jermain Defoes direction as early and directly as possibleKings most audacious attempt involved him changing pace, cutting in from the left and unleashing a curving, dipping shot which hit the underside of the bar and the inside of the far post before somehow rebounding, bagatelle style, to safety",sport
"Goodness knows what might have happened if Didier Ndong, Sunderlands best player, had not been around to hold the home midfield together",sport
"Social media posts had suggested there would be vociferous anti-Moyes protests but the mood was strangely subdued, more about apathy than anger and punctuated by lengthy, slightly surreal, silences",sport
"Perhaps the pre-match hint Moyes dropped, indicating he may leave Sunderland in the summer, had drawn the sting from the dissenters and prevented a mutiny or maybe some of Englands most loyal fans simply had no energy left after such a draining, depressing campaignThere was polite applause when Boruc  by now emerging as a suprisingly influential figure  saved smartly from George Honeyman following Defoes cute reverse ball but not even a mass bout of push and shove engaged in by every outfield player could raise the volume",sport
"It began with Borini catching Lewis Cook late, eventually involved everyone piling in to remonstrate with each other and ended with Stuart Attwell booking Borini and Harry ArterClearly aggrieved, King forlornly demanded a penalty in the wake of Lamine Kons foul but managed to score in the end anyway He shot assuredly low and right beyond Jordan Pickford after being played in by Ryan Fraser on a high-speed break",sport
"Cue the first, initially tentative choruses of We want Moyes out By the time they reached peak volume and stridency, their target was staring into space and Sunderland were in the second tierIt is such a consuming, mesmerising game that the number of professional cricketers who have retired prematurely is remarkably small Last week Zafar Ansari, five months after making his England debut, joined a select band, notable for players who are very bright or very rich or occasionally  and nauseatingly  bothMost professionals keep going until the evidence is overwhelming that they are beyond their peak",sport

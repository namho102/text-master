It’s that time of year again. Thousands of developers are set to descend upon the South Bay to get their software on. And the rest of the Apple watching world will have their eyes glued to the screen on Monday morning for the big WWDC keynote, as Tim Cook and company parade the latest upgrades to the company’s various operating systems.
From the sounds of the early leaks, the show is also set to be more hardware focused than most World Wide Developer Conferences, with some refreshes to a number of key product lines and the reported addition of an Echo competitor that will finally, truly bring Siri to the living room. In fact, most of the rumors and speculation arriving ahead of the event are device related.
We’ll be there on June 5, of course, liveblogging the events as they unfold, starting at 10AM PT/1PM ET. Meantime, here’s some of what we expect to see on display at the big event.
Hardware

Hardware isn’t always a given at WWDC, but this year could well be an embarrassment of riches.
That Siri Speaker: This has been grist for the rumor for at least a year now. Apple has reportedly been quietly (or, not so quietly, really) working on its own version of the Amazon Echo/Google Home, along with some key tweaks to its long-standing smart assistant, Siri. The company has been eyeing the connected home for a while now, through Home Kit and the iOS 10 Home app, but what it really needs to seal the deal is a piece of hardware to tie all of that together.
At the moment, Apple TV is about as close as it comes to have an in-home hub. But while the system does feature voice integration, it’s not an ideal alternative to an always-listening speaker hub like the Echo or Home. Details about the device beyond that are pretty few and far between, but you can probably expect the system to be a much more premium product relative to the competition, because, well, Apple is still Apple.
Early reports have pointed to things like virtual surround sound, suggesting that unlike Echo and Home, Apple will be focused on things like speaker quality, instead of just making a product where sound is secondary to the task of inserting a smart assistant in the home. It also follows that we can expect some key updates to Siri, which seems to have fallen out of focus at Apple in recent years.
iPad Pro 10.5: Another persistent rumor ahead of the event has Apple going adding yet another screen size to its iPad line, after seeming to streamline things a bit in recent months. The supposed 10.5-inch iPad Pro is said to be arriving with a similar footprint as its 9.7-inch sibling, courtesy of dramatically reduced bezels. Apple is still banking on the Pro to take on two-in-ones like the Surface line, a rare bright spot in a lackluster tablet market.
MacBook Pro and Air Spec Bumps: It hasn’t even been a full year since Apple made its first meaningful MacBook refresh in some time, so it follows that any upgrades to the line will most likely be internal-only. According to pre-show rumblings, Intel’s Kaby Lake processors are the flavor of the day, meaning faster speeds and better battery life. The chips are also reportedly coming to the MacBook Air, marking a long-awaited (albeit minor) upgrade to Apple’s long neglected laptop.
Software

Lots of it. So much software. All the software. All of Apple’s operating systems are said to getting a meaningful update this time around. But specific features are pretty few and far between ahead of the event.
iOS 11: Siri speaker stuff aside, iOS will likely be the centerpiece of the keynote, this being a developer conference and all. While the 10th anniversary iPhone 8 almost certainly won’t be debuting until at least the fall, it seems likely that we’ll be getting our first real taste of iOS 11. What shape that will actually take is pretty up in the air at the moment, but a few leaks have popped out here and there. Siri’s a no-brainer, of course, given the expected hub announcement, along with Apple’s bid to stay ahead of Alexa, Assistant and the like. Expect Apple’s AI to take center stage on Monday. And along with the new iPad Pro, the tablet version of the operating system is said to be getting some pro-level updates like multi-user login and expanded support for the Apple Pencil. A revamped version of Music also seems a likely bet, especially as Apple pushes for more video content.
macOS/watchOS/tvOS: All three operating systems are expected to get big refreshes this time out, though again, details are pretty scant here. Expect the most dramatic changes on the watchOS and tvOS front. As for watchOS, The Apple Watch is a rare bright spot in the floundering wearables category, and the company is no doubt hoping to make a splash ahead of the new device’s arrival later in the year. Of particular note is Apple’s recent fixation with all things health on the device.

Blue Apron wasn’t the only venture-backed business to announce its IPO this week. Tintri, an enterprise cloud platform company, unveiled its filing. 
The stock market is doing well and there’s been a strong appetite for tech offerings, so it’s a good time to go public.  But Tintri’s mounting losses could prove to be problematic.
Tintri brought in $125.1 million in revenue for its latest fiscal year, but their losses were nearly as big, at negative $105.8 million. Although it’s a better ratio than last year, when revenue was $86 million and losses were $100.1 million. The year before also had losses that exceeded the revenue.
So where is the money going? It looks like “sales and marketing” is Tintri’s biggest expense, which cost the company $108.9 million in the latest year. Tintri also spent $53.4 million on research and development.
In the “risk factors” section of the filing, the company warns it has “‘a history of losses and may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability.” They said the accumulated deficit is $338.7 million. “We anticipate that our operating expenses will increase substantially in the foreseeable future as we continue to hire additional employees, develop our technology and enhance our product and service offerings, expand our sales and marketing teams, make investments in our distribution channels, expand our operations and prepare to become a public reporting company,” said the filing.
They also acknowledge they face “intense competition” from “numerous established companies that sell competitive enterprise cloud infrastructure systems or storage solutions.” Some of the data center competitors listed include EMC, Dell, NetApp, IBM and VMware. Flash storage rivals include Nimble Storage from HP Enterprise, Nutanix and Pure Storage.
Nutanix went public last year and is still trading above its IPO price, a decent sign for Tintri if investors consider them a comparable. But Pure Storage is trading below its 2015 IPO price, a bad indicator for the category.
Tintri touts its big customers. They have over 1250 enterprise clients, including 21 of the Fortune 100 companies. Sony Computer, MillerCoors, and The Carlyle Group are some of their notable users.
Venture capitalists like Tintri. The Mountain View, California-based company has raised at least $260 million in funding, dating back to 2011. Its valuation at the last funding round was said to be $785 million.
New Enterprise Associates (NEA) has the largest stake at 22.7%. Silver Lake owns 20.4%, Insight Venture Partners owns 20.2% and Lightspeed Venture Partners owns 14.5%.
The company is listing on the Nasdaq, under the ticker “TNTR.” Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch are leading the offering.
Due to the JOBS Act, companies generally unveil their filing 15 days before the investor roadshow. The timing suggests they are aiming for a debut in late June or early July.
 
The revelation behind Google Cardboard was that if you put your phone close enough to your eyes, it’s basically a VR headset — but it’s not quite that simple for mixed reality setups like Microsoft’s HoloLens. Or is it? HoloKit is an extremely clever DIY solution for a quick and dirty augmented reality experience with a bare minimum of equipment.
The idea is really quite simple: Instead of a costly projection system, a pair of mirrors reflects the display of a smartphone onto an angled, semi-transparent Fresnel lens — so you see both the image and the world behind it. Meanwhile, the phone is in position to use its camera and sensors to track the world in front of you.
It really is clever, and reminiscent of half-mirrored-glass optical tricks going back decades. It’s not quite so simple as Cardboard, though — it requires mirrors and a special Fresnel lens set to pull this off. But considering you can’t even buy a HoloLens right now, this is a relatively cheap and easy way to test out AR applications or deploy them quickly to groups.
Did you really think museums would put tethered HoloLens setups on groups of kids so they can see a T-Rex’s body overlaid on its skeleton? Nah. But I can definitely see these being put to use that way, though they’ll want to keep an eye on the devices the users will be balancing on their heads. (A headstrap may be a good idea for future iterations.)

Right now HoloKit (its name until Microsoft sends the inevitable cease and desist) supports the iPhone 7 and Plus, Pixel phones and Project Tango hardware.
Amber Garage, an AR outfit founded by Botao Hu, is behind the kit. He presented it at the Augmented World Expo yesterday, and plans to release the code and other documentation next week on GitHub.
Cool, right? Ready-to-assemble kits should be available starting in July. Keep an eye on the website, or go ask them in person at AR in Action.
Update: Or check out the Aryzon, which recently met its Kickstarter goal and is shipping in September.

IMSI catchers, devices used to spoof cell towers and intercept communications, are one of the most resented open secrets of law enforcement. Strict non-disclosure agreements prevent them from being acknowledged as existing, let alone being used — but researchers think they’ve found a way to spot the shady signal-snatchers.
The devices, colloquially called Stingrays after a common model, work by sending out signals much like cell towers do; cell phones connect, identify themselves and send information like texts and calls through the fake tower, creating a sort of mobile wiretap. Critics have argued that innocent people’s data is caught up in this dragnet, but law enforcement has been less than forthcoming owing to gag orders from the companies that provide the devices.
What’s needed is an independent method of identifying IMSI catchers in the wild. That’s what University of Washington researchers Peter Ney and Ian Smith have attempted to create with SeaGlass.
“Up until now the use of IMSI-catchers around the world has been shrouded in mystery, and this lack of concrete information is a barrier to informed public discussion,” explained Ney in a UW news release. “Having additional, independent and credible sources of information on cell-site simulators is critical to understanding how — and how responsibly — they are being used.”

The team put together a sort of super-powered wardriving setup that uses a “bait phone,” GSM modem, GPS unit, Wi-Fi hotspot and other wireless doodads packed into a single box. These devices monitor and record the wireless signals they encounter. In order to cover as much area as possible, boxes were attached to 15 vehicles being used by rideshare drivers in Seattle and Milwaukee.
The baseline map shown as it grew; red signals are stronger and more reliable
Over a period of two months, the kits collected a baseline of wireless activity, including known towers, private signals and so on. But sifting through the data revealed some suspicious outlier signals.
One signal source, for instance, changed six times over the two months the frequencies on which it transmitted — unlike 96 percent of sources detected. Five of those frequencies were only able to be detected within 1,500 feet of the building.
One might write this off as a test or nanocell, except for the fact that this particular source happens to be located in or around an immigration services building run by Homeland Security. Could that be a Stingray, in position to target recent immigrants? The data is consistent with that hypothesis, but more data is needed to be sure.

The building in question, indicated by a diamond, produced many normal signals (green), but suspicious ones at close range (other colors)
“We want to be careful about our conclusions,” cautioned Smith. “We did find weird and interesting patterns at certain locations that match what we would expect to see from a cell-site simulator, but that’s as much as we can say from an initial pilot study.”
At the very least it also provides advocates and journalists with something to work with. In attempting last year to discover whether Seattle police were using Stingrays, I found myself lacking in pointed questions to ask: although I received an unequivocal “no,” rather than a brush-off, it would have been nice to have something specific in mind, like a location or operation. I may just ask DHS about the suspicious signal mentioned above.
Unfortunately, the team wasn’t able to get their hands on an actual IMSI catcher to ground-truth these findings — the devices are jealously guarded by their keepers and information about them is really only available through leaked documents and the occasional missed redaction. Smith told me in an email that they did, however, roll their own Stingray-esque device based on what they know of how the things work.
Researchers Peter Ney (left) and Ian Smith
The detection kits contained around $500 worth of parts, all of which are specified in the paper describing the work. Smith suggested the cost could come down with scale, though.
“We’re eager to push this out into the community and find partners who can crowdsource more data collection and begin to connect the dots in meaningful ways,” he said.
Transparency advocates would love to have a working system like this, certainly, though it must also be said that the criminal element would find it useful too. But that’s the case with any tool, including IMSI catchers.
You can find out more about the tool or explore the data the team has collected at the SeaGlass site.

On the internet no-one knows you’re a dog. And no-one knows whether that “fact” you’re reading — say, about President Putin’s pet dog having been trained to cock its leg at the word “trump” — is bona fide truth or more nonsense FAKE NEWS doing the rounds on Facebook.
All we can be really sure is that fake news has legs and runs at a blisteringly fast clip these days, thanks to massive engagement across vast social platforms engineered for digital spreading. In short, it’s a disorienting time for anyone trying to triangulate truth amid all these sneaking lies.
Which is where Storyzy wants to help out — with a just-launched quote verifier tool which, while it’s unlikely to be able to provide copper-bottomed reassurance for more obscure quotations across the full gamut of online media, might at least be able to give a thumbs up or down on words (apparently) uttered by higher-profile individuals, such as politicians, who are both widely covered in the mainstream media and widely targeted as the subjects of hoaxes.
Much socially spread fake news can hardly be accused of being subtle in its deceptions — indeed, wilder claims appear to be favored as a baiting strategy to spark more clicks — so mainstream quotation checking feels like a sensible place to try to fight back against mass misinformation.
The tool, which uses natural language processing to harvest quotations from its trusted media sources, is the work of a French team. They actually started on their idea back in 2012 — under a different name and with the rather more ambitious aim of building an “automated fact checking add on/overlay on every website,” says CEO and co-founder Stan Motte. An idea that was clearly a bit too ambitious. Hence resetting to focus on verifying quotations.
“We came to the conclusion that quotes are the only part of the news we can automatize at very large volumes and without any grey areas/discussions: “Did they say it or not?”, and the proof provided in every case (the source),” he says, via email.
They’re using a database of 5,000 — in their words — “reliable sources” from the mainstream media for verifying quotes (they display the source as part of the quote check). And, yes, their sources include The New York Times. So this tool is not going to please anyone who accuses the mainstream media of embedded bias…


The failing @nytimes writes total fiction concerning me. They have gotten it wrong for two years, and now are making up stories & sources!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 6, 2017



But, in all truth, such folks probably aren’t the sort to think of using a quotation verifying tool in the first place.


The Fake News Media works hard at disparaging & demeaning my use of social media because they don't want America to hear the real story!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 29, 2017



Storyzy says it has a database of +15 million “authentic quotes” sourced from the mainstream media news since 2015 at this point.
Given that news is a dynamic medium, they’re crawling around 50,000 articles daily to add around the same number of additional quotes per day to keep up to speed with current affairs.
“It only took Storyzy a minute to display Macron’s quote last night (“make our planet great again”) reacting to Trump’s statement on the Paris Agreement,” adds Motte.
The verifier struggled when I tried it on some famed Trumpisms. But, for one thing, it’s not currently ingesting broadcast quotations — though Motte says the team is working on speech to text too. It also appears to get confused by partial quotes at times. Longer quotations with, say, small discrepancies in transcription may also confuse it. So it’s clearly far from perfect.
It’s been intentionally designed to flag up at least some of the issues as potential problems though, according to Motte, and will badge a quote as “dubious” if it can’t find it at all in its database, or “incomplete” if it’s not all there — linking the user to a full version of the quote via one of its media sources.
“Our Quote Verifier identifies if someone really said that or not or truncated. With the ambition to strengthen the reliability. Storyzy always provides multitude of sources per quote and allows users to have access to the full context of the quote,” he adds.
The quote checker is free to use, but the team’s hope is to spark interest from social platforms and search engines with a plan to propose an API for two scenarios: automatically flagging fake quotes before they have a chance to go viral, and for helping moderators identify fake content. “It is a huge cost,” adds Motte.
And just in case you were under the (false) impression fake digital news is a modern phenomenon, the team behind the tool was inspired as far back as 1999 — when they were producing digital news content for an ISP.
“We witnessed the increasing ‘bullshit’ in online news (explosion of number of sources, clickbaits, brandcontent…) so we wanted to develop a solution to help users overcome this problem,” he adds.
Sequoia Capital has raised $4 billion in funding for a variety of funds, according to SEC filings released yesterday. That includes $2 billion for its second growth fund, the size of which had previously not been announced.
In addition to its growth fund, a filing for Sequoia’s China Growth Fund IV, which was launched early last year, showed that the firm had raised $900 million to invest in startups in that market. Another filing for Sequoia Capital India IV, a fund that’s been around since 2014, revealed that the firm had raised about $700 million for that market.
Also among the filings was Sequoia’s fourteenth U.S. fund, which saw its first filing drop back in 2012. A followup filing in 2013 unveiled that the amount raised totaled $475 million. The latest filing shows that it hasn’t grown since then, although the fund is still not closed, suggesting that Sequoia could raise more capital to invest in startups backed in that vintage.
A representative from Sequoia declined to comment on the filings.

For such a simple tool, the white cane has been incredibly enduring. With all of the technological advances that have been made over the past century, we haven’t come up with much better than a stick with a metal tip for helping the visually impaired get around. Though researchers at MIT have been working on a wearable solution designed to augment and, hopefully, one day replace the cane.
The system features a 3D camera with an on-board computer hung around the neck at chest level. The camera senses the location of objects, converting the signals into pulsing haptic vibrations that alert the wearer to the location of an object. The on-board motors vibrate with a variety of patterns and frequencies to signify different things, like the distance of an object.
The team says the abdomen is the ideal spot for the vibrating belt, because it has the right amount of sensitivity, but doesn’t interfere with other senses. Audio indications were ruled out in early testing, as visually impaired people tend to rely very heavily on their hearing. And buzzing around the head and neck, understandably, just would have been too distracting.

The system also uses object recognition and braille pads to identify specific objects — popping up, say, a “t” for “table” or “c” for “chair.” It also is able to understand and relay distinctions well beyond what the simple cane is capable of, like whether or not the chair in question is occupied.
“The system can assist the user to do tasks well beyond what a white cane can do,” Daniela Rus, the head of MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) tells TechCrunch. “Like finding a chair in a hotel lobby and understanding whether it is empty or not. We take this kind of task for granted — but just close your eyes and imagine how you would find an empty chair in a crowded space with the use of a white cane that gives you only point information about the world.”
The team has been testing the system on visually impaired subjects around its labs to good effect. With the chair-finding test, the system is able to reduce accidental contact by 80 percent. When the subjects were asked to navigate around the MIT halls, collisions with people hanging around the hallway were reduced by 86 percent.
It’s still pretty early stages. The team has only used the system with about 10 volunteers at the moment, so a lot more testing is needed if it’s ever going to become a viable option for sight-impaired people. And it will be even longer before it means people can throw away the cane. Though Rus is hopeful that it will some day lead to something commercially viable.
“In a world where computers help us with everything from navigating space travel to counting the steps we take in a day, I think we can do better to support visually impaired people than a walking stick,” says Rus. “Not by retrofitting something we’ve already designed, or looking for ways to use current applications in novel ways, but by working with the visually impaired to understand how computers can augment their capabilities, become an extra set of eyes in a way, and then developing technology with the expressed purpose of fulfilling that goal.”
Face-swapping — taking your image and adjusting it to fit on to a different body, creature or object — has taken the photo app world by storm, as millions of people look for new and novel things to do with their selfies. Microsoft is the latest company to enter the fray. The company’s in-house app studio Microsoft Garage has quietly launched a new app — the aptly called Face Swap. 
The Android app is now live in the U.S., Australia and Canada, with plans to expand to India and iOS in the coming weeks, a spokesperson tells us.
Part image search engine, and part photo editing toolkit, you take a pic of yourself, adjust it a little, and then use keywords to find an image where you can replace the face with yours either from your camera roll, from the catalog in the app, from the wider world of images as indexed by Bing. Microsoft automatically adjusts your skin tone to the surroundings and textures, and you can make other edits with lighting and tilting and resizing your face, before sharing it on other social channels.
Microsoft notes some of the more practical applications: trying out a new hairstyle or seeing how an article of clothes looks with your face (although not your actual body, yet). You can swap out multiple pics in a group photo, too.
For those who may be keeping tabs on Microsoft, the name ‘Face Swap’ may sound a little familiar. That’s because Microsoft, by way of Microsoft Research, actually released another app back in 2011 that was also called Face Swap. That earlier Face Swap was just for Windows devices, and it never really caught on.
Or maybe it was just a little too ahead of its time.
Today, face-editing tools are everywhere. Apps like Snapchat let you morph into different creatures.
And FaceApp had its 15 minutes of fame for letting you take a pic of yourself or someone else and view that same picture in a foursquare as a younger person, an older person, and with changed gender (yes, sometimes controversially).
Facebook has snapped up Msqrd, Apple acquired Faceshift, and we’ve heard others are also on the hunt for their own tech and talent in computer vision and neural network processing (two cornerstones behind how a lot of these apps work), to built out virtual reality and augmented reality applications, expand their video services, and keep consumers entertained.
Microsoft also wants to be in on the action, and it’s actually starting with a very substantial trove of its own assets. A spokesperson confirmed to us that the new Face Swap app was built using 3D face modelling from the computer vision team at Microsoft Research (that is, the tech that went into the old Face Swap app). The team also “we made several algorithmic improvements to build a highly scalable face-swap service on Azure.”
While the Garage develops a number of different services (like this app to enhance colors for color-blind people) Face Swap was created by a team of people in the Garage called the “Bingcubator” — which, as its name implies, is focused on figuring out innovative ways to use the Bing search algorithms to create funky new services. “The power of Bing search and our intelligent face swapping tech makes every swipe a delight,” engineer Phil Rogan notes.
But while Bing — like all search engines — is predicated on audiences, advertising, and people clicking on lines for its business model, the same does not go for the Bing-powered Face Swap.
“Search & transport yourself into fun & inspirational scenes,” Microsoft notes on its YouTube video (embedded below) showing off the wonders of Face Swap. “No Ads, just swaps.”
Time will tell if the no-ad rule remains, and indeed if the app takes off at all. There is a lot of heated competition. Maybe the little twist here, of being able to search across a huge range of images to swap your face, will give this the unique selling point it needs to get some buzz.
And I’m guessing Microsoft hopes that buzz is positive rather than iffy. As we’ve seen before, image swapping apps can sometimes backfire in awful ways.

 
Some 1.4 billion people lack access to electricity worldwide today, most in rural areas across Southeast Asia, China, India and Sub-Saharan Africa, according to data from the OECD.
While others are focused on wiring up those places and developing new energy sources, a startup called Evaptainers has created a kind of refrigerator that requires no electricity, runs instead on water and can keep food and drinks significantly cooler than the temperature outside.
Evaptainers’ co-founders Spencer Taylor, Quang Truong and Jeremy Fryer-Biggs developed their cooling units as a kind of modern take on an analog invention, the “zeer pot,” or pot-in-pot refrigerator. The way these things work is something like sweating.
Evaptainers co-founders: Spencer Taylor, Quang Truong and Jeremy Fryer-Biggs.
Taylor said, “As we sweat, water molecules draw heat out of our bodies to go through a phase-change, and evaporate. As that happens we cool down. This machine has water in a tank, and permeable membranes that deliver water to evaporative walls.”
Each unit of the company’s newest EV-8-model refrigerators requires about 1/3 of a liter of water to operate per day in a place that’s got less than 65 percent humidity on a hot day. They can store 60 liters, about 5 gallons of milk, and chill contents by about 35 degrees Fahrenheit from the ambient air temperature.
To turn on the device, users just pour water into a port on the top of it. The water doesn’t have to be potable. The Evaptainers can be folded up, which makes them portable and easy to transport into rural communities that need them most.
While the company is on a mission to reduce food spoilage in places where sustenance is hard to come by, it is operating as a for-profit, for-good business with five employees in North America and two in North Africa at this time. The company has raised nearly half a million dollars in grant funding to get started.
Evaptainers EV-8 refrigerator is collapsible, and runs on water, not electricity.
Truong told TechCrunch his original idea for the company was inspired by courses that he took at Tufts Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy and MIT, as well as by failed efforts by non-government organizations and philanthropists to feed the world.
The founder said, “With a variety of agriculture projects you’ll see people spending millions to try to build a cold storage warehouse in places were graft, corruption and other issues make it hard to even get something built. But then there’s this issue of what to do if you don’t have a reliable electric system, or grid in the first place. The short answer is to do something that doesn’t require electricity.”
Besides the company’s interest in helping people who live without reliable access to food and electricity, Evaptainers is considering developing a version of its refrigerators for outdoor sports and camping enthusiasts.
“We’d like to do something where the higher margins in the U.S. support our ability to put this technology in the hands of people who wouldn’t be able to pay for poor rural consumers and food producers in emerging markets,” Taylor said.

Major technology platforms shift every 10-15 years, with new platforms building on the ones they preceded. The PC was the platform of the early-1980s, then the internet came in the mid-1990s to improve the functionality and connectedness of PCs, then the smartphone emerged in the mid-2000s to put an internet-connected PC in everyone’s pocket.
We’re due for the next major technology platform shift, and artificial intelligence, augmented reality, and virtual reality are those next platforms.
So how do you maximize value creation for the next wave? Here’s our answer:
If you can create an operating system (OS), create an OS. If you can’t create an OS, optimize a component of the new technology platform. If you can’t optimize anything in the new platform, at least disrupt an industry that’s been relatively untouched by technology.
Let’s touch on each of those three opportunities.
Build an OS
If you can build an operating system, build an operating system. We define an operating system as combining core pieces of new technology into a single platform that makes them available to third parties. This is different than the dictionary definition because we don’t see operating systems as purely related to a computer.
We would argue that Google is the OS of the web, combining organic discovery, paid discovery, video content distribution, monetization tools, analytics, etc. If you have a web presence, you must, in some way, touch Google.
Amazon is the leading OS for commerce. They combine proprietary fulfillment, third-party sales, payments, audience driven by a strong brand, etc. If you sell things online, you should consider doing it through Amazon. Facebook is a social OS. They combine the social graph, news feed, video/live video, messaging, targeted promotion, etc. If you want to build services that connect people with one another in some way, you should do it through Facebook. And, of course, iOS and Android combine a camera, a touchscreen, GPS/location, an accelerometer and internet access, and offer ways for third-party developers to distribute their software (app stores).
Owning the OS layer has historically been the path to the greatest returns during technology platform shifts. Apple, Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Facebook all have market caps over $400 billion as of this writing, making them some of the biggest companies in the world.
We expect those five companies are going to spend more than $50 billion in R&D this year and $5 billion-plus will go toward the development of AI/AR/VR “OSes.” Thus, owning an OS in the new computing paradigm is hard and highly competitive. Everyone knows how much value there is in owning the OS layer. It’s why Facebook paid $2 billion for Oculus when it was just a developer kit — a shot at owning the OS for virtual reality. It’s also why private companies like Magic Leap have had so much venture interest regardless of valuation — a shot at owning the OS for augmented reality. If they succeed, the returns will be substantial.

Optimize a new technology component
If you can’t build an OS, optimize a component of the new technology platform. Snapchat and Uber are two examples of this type of opportunity from the smartphone shift. Snapchat optimized the smartphone camera, making it more fun and engaging. They created disappearing messages, stories and lenses to enhance the content that users could create. They built a culture around fun and natural content.
Facebook has since followed in opening up the camera to developers at this year’s F8. Uber built a business that optimized the GPS/location component of the smartphone. The purpose of a map is to get somewhere. Uber optimized this intent, creating a logistics platform that paired users looking for a ride given a specific location with nearby drivers. Beyond Snapchat and Uber, Dropbox optimized file sharing, Spotify optimized music consumption, Stripe optimized payments, Slack optimized communications for business, etc.
The interesting thing about optimizing a component in a new technology platform is that it can open the window to create an operating system: Combining core technologies and making them available to third parties. Now Snapchat is experimenting with hardware like Spectacles, which may be an early experiment in creating an AR OS. You could argue that Uber is building a transportation OS getting into food and other delivery segments, as well as autonomous vehicles.
Considering the AR/VR piece of the next major technology shift, most component optimization is still focused on cameras/optics. This is logical because AR requires cameras to map the real world and overlay useful content and information. High-quality VR experiences will also require cameras to read the real world so you can move more freely in the virtual one.
Sound seems to be an area that is underinvested. Next to vision, sound is the most important element for sense immersion. Sound and language processing are also important in AI as interfaces increasingly incorporate voice. Hearables will be just as important to the computer interface of the future as head-mounted displays — and more important than watches.
Another underappreciated technology component for AI/AR/VR is braintech. We see the evolution beyond headset-based AR and VR being delivered through some sort of direct brain interface. The challenges of doing this in a noninvasive way are obvious, but the benefits to the experience are just as apparent.
There are technical limitations to how well we can trick the eyes, ears and other sense inputs as to the reality of AR and VR creations. Bypassing sense inputs means that we can move past pixels and haptic frequencies and into neuronal firing patterns. In the near term we see braintech as enhancing AR and VR experiences, but long-term braintech may be the next major operating system to emerge.

Disrupt an industry untouched by technology
If you can’t optimize a piece of the next technology stack, at least disrupt an industry relatively untouched by technology. Uber did this in tandem with optimizing a piece of the tech stack by changing how the taxi industry operated. Airbnb did this for unused real estate, WeWork for office space, SoFi for loans and financing and Oscar for health insurance.
We think there are many industries that have yet to be significantly disrupted by technology. There are a lot of industries that could fit into this category, but three major ones where we’re spending time are real estate, brick and mortar retail and education.
While real estate marketing has been transformed by the internet, the way salespeople and brokers are paid is still legacy. Because of the availability of listings online, the job of real estate professionals has changed, but the way they are compensated has not.
We expect the way that real estate is purchased will be different in the next 10-20 years, driven by AI/AR/VR displacing real estate professionals. The company or companies that capture the value currently accrued to agents and brokers has a chance to be at the scale of the Airbnbs and WeWorks of the world.
Brick-and-mortar retail has suffered because of the rapid shift to online shopping. Online currently represents XX percent of total U.S. commerce, but we see it reaching 55% over the next several decades. While the selection, convenience and price of online shopping are major factors in the shift, the way we shop in offline stores is largely unchanged over the past several decades. That browsing experience is the same.
We might use our phones to find coupons, locate a product in store or for rewards, but there is little technology injected to the overall shopping experience itself. We think that finding ways to leverage customer data to deliver customized shopping experiences, combined with hiring and training employees to personalize the experience, is the future of brick-and-mortar retail.
Professional education has gotten better through technology products like Udemy and Coursera, but the way K-12 students are educated has not seen meaningful impact from technology. The biggest barrier is the politics of working with local, state and federal governments, combined with limited budgets. We see the future of education in external courses, not government-supplied ones, because open platforms allow the best teachers to teach at scale. Knowledge is a commodity, but motivation is rare and accreditation is where the value lies.
AI can help keep students motivated by customizing courses based on speed of learning and relative weaknesses, while AR and VR can make learning more immersive and interactive. Moving away from our legacy school system will be difficult given unions and political nearsightedness, but a better system can emerge if we allow it.
While we think those three industries will see great disruption through the next tech wave, there will obviously be great businesses in tech-forward spaces like entertainment and gaming. They just might not be the game-changing types of companies with rare valuations like Uber, Airbnb and WeWork.

We’re always looking
There are a lot of factors that go into making venture investments. Team, theme, market, doing something non-incremental, etc. We think understanding where the product or service fits in this hierarchy is equally important.
The framework helps us put into context the relative rarity of a company creating something at the OS layer, the opportunities in optimizing specific parts of the technology platforms of the future and what industry segments are ripest for innovation. So the mantra applied to us is:
If we can invest in a great team building a potential OS layer, we will. If we can’t find OS-layer companies, we’ll look for ones that are optimizing components of the computing platforms of the future. If we can’t find those companies, we’ll look for companies disrupting an industry that desperately needs it. And if we can’t find that, we’ll keep looking.

This week President Trump made the senseless decision to withdraw from the Paris Climate Accord, prompting Elon Musk and Bob Iger to leave the White House advisory councils. Blue Apron filed for IPO, and Mary Meeker’s 2017 internet trends report was released. These are some of the top events that happened in tech this week (you also can get this post as a weekend newsletter sent to your inbox on Saturdays). 
1. US withdrawal from Paris Climate Accord sparks pushback from Elon Musk and other corporate leaders
Elon Musk left President Trump’s White House advisory councils, he said today on Twitter. The Tesla and SpaceX CEO promised Wednesday he would step down from his official advisory roles with the administration should Trump go through with his plan to leave the Paris Climate Accord. Trump announced the U.S. would be removing itself form the agreement on Thursday, and Musk and Disney CEO Bob Iger have departed since then. Apple CEO Tim Cook also spoke out in a letter to employees, saying that he spoke with President Trump two days prior to the announcement and “tried to persuade him” not to withdraw, but “it wasn’t enough.” Major businesses and investors have come out against President Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Paris Climate Accord, as well.
2. Mary Meeker’s 2017 internet trends report arrives
Mary Meeker’s annual internet trends report was released, which is pretty much the State of the Union for tech. We broke down a few of the most noteworthy slides from the 355-page document and explained why they’re important. Some of the highlights are that e-sports is booming, smartphone sales and internet penetration are dropping, tech is shaping healthcare and Google and Facebook control 85 percent of online ad growth. You can read the whole thing here.
3. Blue Apron is going public 
Blue Apron, the meal ingredient delivery service, filed to go public. The company’s financials are showing an incredible amount of growth. Blue Apron said it generated nearly $800 million in revenue in 2016, up from $341 million in 2015.

4. Andy Rubin’s Essential company unveils its first smartphone
Android creator Andy Rubin’s new company Essential unveiled its first smartphone alongside an Amazon Echo-like device and a new operating system called “Ambient.” On first impression, the phone is pretty stunning, and costs $699. It may be awhile, though, until it reaches consumer success. 
5. Sprig is shutting down
Sprig, the startup that makes and delivers its own food, shut down. “It is with a heavy heart that my co-founders and I share that Sprig, Inc. will be shutting down the app today,” Sprig CEO Gagan Biyani wrote in an email to customers.
6. Silk Road creator sentenced to serve lifetime prison sentence 
Silk Road creator Ross Ulbricht lost his appeal and will serve a life sentence in prison. Two years ago, Ulbricht was sentenced to life in prison for his role in running the dark web exchange, best known as a once-thriving online marketplace for drug transactions.
7. Uber’s head of finance is leaving
Uber’s head of finance, Gautam Gupta, is leaving the company in July. Gupta’s plan is to join another SF-based startup as COO. News of his impending departure comes as Uber has reported losses of $708 million. New documents also showed that Uber blew through $1 million a week in efforts to make UberPool viable in San Francisco. 
8. Uber fires Anthony Levandowski
Uber has terminated the employment of Anthony Levandowski, the co-founder of self-driving trucking company Otto and Uber’s former self-driving project engineering lead. Levandowski is at the heart of an ongoing legal battle between Uber and Waymo, the Alphabet company that resulted from Google’s self-driving car project.

Hillary Clinton appeared onstage at Code Conference to discuss the election. Mark Andreessen also spoke, calling Silicon Valley “extremely liberal.”
“Net neutrality is viewed by many as a bright spot in the otherwise rather dim and confused tech policies of the United States, and its enemies are subject to the harshest disdain. How, many ask, could anyone oppose such a simple, common-sense measure, except out of ignorance, avarice or both?” Read on in Commission Impossible: How and why the FCC created net neutrality.
There are a number of places to find travel inspiration — Pinterest, Google Destinations, travel blogs or media sites like Condé Nast’s Traveler, among others. But a new application called Sherpa launching this week believes that some of the best travel ideas can be found on Instagram. The iOS application curates photos from top Instagram photographers and turns them into visual travel guides that are augmented with data from other services, like Foursquare and Wikipedia.
Sherpa co-founder and CEO Paul Aaron previously founded NYC-based design studio Modern Assembly, which worked with brands like Coca-Cola, UNICEF, Droga5, The Climate Reality Project and even The Rock (Dwayne Johnson). He also spent several years heading digital at Silver + Partners, and previously Crispin Porter + Bogusky.
“Sherpa came about when the digital design and development studio I founded, Modern Assembly, was asked to pitch ideas for a leading travel review website,” explains Aaron. “As I dug into their business, it became apparent to me that the review system itself was creating an experience that was cumbersome, difficult to contribute to, and prone to fraud.”
“The idea for Sherpa was to use the photos we already share everyday to create a travel planning experience that is more authentic, emotionally resonant, and easy to contribute to,” says Aaron.
The startup is currently working with more than 2,000 Instagram photographers — or, as it calls them, “micro-influencers” — across 90 countries. This includes names like Andrew Kearns, Roman Koenigshofer, Marianne Hope, Sean Byrne, Kirsten Alana, Irina, Patrick Florian and Lukas Elias Winkler, among others.

Sherpa takes their content and turns it into guides that appeal to a variety of types of travelers — ranging from backpackers to adventurers to luxury travelers and more. At launch, more than 500,000 geotagged photos have been organized into 15,000 travel guides that are presented in the app as albums.
To use the app, you first have to provide your email, connect with Instagram and tell Sherpa your “home base” (where you live). You can also optionally tell the app where you’ve been by allowing it to organize your own Instagram photos by location. (I’d skip this if you have a private Instagram account, however, as your photos become public in the app.)
You can then browse through Sherpa’s travel guides either by typing in a specific destination in the search box or by scrolling through its selection of “trending locations.” While the Wikipedia content helps you get a basic understanding of the locale, Sherpa’s real purpose is to help you get inspired through travel photography.

As you browse the app, you can save to your “suitcase” photos of places you want to go, and, by doing so, Sherpa will begin to boost destinations related to those photos to personalize the content to your interests.
Because this is largely a visual browsing app, it’s not one that’s best for actually planning the details involved with your travels, such as finding flights, booking lodging and tours or mapping out your route.
However, that could change in time.
“Eventually, every photo you see on Sherpa will be bookable, and you’ll be able to search for trending hotels, or book the amazing off-the-beaten path trip that a travel photographer you follow has gone on,” notes Aaron. “As the platform grows, we’ll monetize these bookings just like an online travel agency does.”
But today, with its minimalistic design and beautiful imagery, it’s still a good first stop for figuring out where it is you might want to go.

Brooklyn-based Sherpa is a three-person team, including co-founders Adam Gettings and Tom Hadley. It has raised a small amount of angel funding.
The app was previously available as an invite-only beta for the past six months, while it built out it location-specific guides and community.
The app is a free download on the Apple App Store.
When small and medium businesses want to build a website, they can take advantage of easy-to-use web tools like Squarespace — but who do they turn to when they need more technical help?
New York City startup Lorem Technologies is trying to make this process easier. After all, CEO Sam Wilcoxon (pictured above with his co-founder Charlie Fogarty) told me that not only do many business owners lack the technical knowledge to build, customize or fix their sites — they also don’t have the time or the know-how to find and manage freelancers to help.
With Lorem, on the other hand, they can just press an “instant help” button and, within a minute, the startup will match them with a freelance developer or designer who’s suited for the job. The business owner can talk with them via chat or voice, get a quote and provide temporary access to their website using the Lorem plug-in (which is currently available for WordPress and Squarespace).
Wilcoxon said Lorem (the name comes from “lorem ipsum” filler text) is focused on small, quick jobs — they can range from $5 to $500, but most of them cost less than $100. Some of the most common tasks involve fixing broken parts of a website, customizing the site with CSS and JavaScript and building integrations with services like Google Analytics and MailChimp.
The goal is to turn Lorem into the resource that businesses turn to whenever they need development or design help. And the startup seems to have made a good start with its current customers — Wilcoxon said 42 percent of them come back with a second job.
Fogarty added that Lorem vets all of its freelancers, because it’s important that the business owner knows that they’re going to be paired with someone “trustworthy, a true expert.”
“You get this magical experience, where you have a trusted partner,” he said.
And from the freelancer’s perspective, they can just go about their normal workday without having to chase down the work — they’ll get alerted by their browser when Lorem has a job for them.
Lorem recently graduated from the Techstars Boston accelerator. Its seed funding was led by Flybridge, with participation from Founder Collective and angel investors, including Constant Contact founder Randy Parker and Frederick Townes, creator of the W3 Total Cache plug-in for WordPress.
As the U.S. seems to be hell-bent on making itself less attractive to immigrants and visitors, its neighbors to the north are sensing an opening and going the other way in an effort to attract the smartest tech entrepreneurs. The country launched its startup visa program a few years ago and even though growth was slow (maybe too slow) in the early years, it’s now ramping up. To apply for a startup visa, entrepreneurs had to first secure a minimum investment of at least $200,000 from a Canadian venture capital fund or $75,000 for a Canadian angel investor.
Launch Academy, the Vancouver-based not-for-profit startup accelerator, is starting a new program in partnership with the Canadian government that does away with this requirement. Instead, Launch Academy and its advisers will vet applicants and recommend them to the Canadian government for the visa and permanent residency process. Because of this, it’s not just an option for startups but also for founders of more mature companies that want to put their roots down in North America.
Successful applicants — and their families and core team — will be immediately eligible to apply for work visas and permanent residency. Those visas should arrive within weeks (and potentially faster) and the residency process should take about six months.
The team is especially looking for companies that work in AI, VR/AR/MR, blockchain, fintech, data science, quantum computing, healthtech and cybersecurity, though others can apply.
Entrepreneurs will also get access to the Launch Academy network of mentors and support and services from companies like Microsoft, Amazon and Google (mostly in the form of cloud credits). Sadly, entrepreneurs will not receive a lifelong supply of delicious poutine.
The fact that both family members and core employees are included here is key, especially given that most U.S. visas only allow the primary applicant to work. For many entrepreneurs, that can be a deal breaker, both because they want their spouses to be able to work and because they want to stay close to their team. This also means that if the startup fails for whatever reason, they can still stay in Canada.
The Launch Academy team tells me that it received about 100 pre-applications with more than 20 promising candidates. Geographically, they hail from all over the world and include Harvard, Yale and MIT grads, as well as former Google and Facebook employees.
It’s worth noting that this is a paid program that is paid by the applicant company. As Launch Academy CEO Ray Walia tells me, the cost of the program will be $30,000 (Canadian, of course). “In that time frame we help the program participants acclimate their business to the North American marketplace and integrate their business into the community and connect them with resources to also help their families settle in to their new lives in Canada,” he explained. Launch Academy says it will reinvest all of the program’s proceeds back into the Canadian tech and talent ecosystem and it won’t take a stake in the companies.
Clarification: It’s worth noting that the Startup Visa Program itself is free to apply for. The paid program is Launch Academy’s Acclimation Program for companies that are looking for support in moving their company and families to Canada. “The Launch Academy Startup Visa program is free to apply to for companies with a preexisting relationship with Launch Academy,” Walia explained to me. “If you have not previously participated in any Launch Academy programs and are an international company looking to make the move to Canada we highly recommend participation in our Acclimation Program. The Acclimation program is a 6 month program and offered as a support program for Startup Visa applicants. The Acclimation program will help participants acclimate their business to the North American marketplace and integrate their business into the community and connect them with resources to also help their families settle in to their new lives in Canada.”

Penguin’s business-focused imprint Portfolio plans to publish a book recounting the legal dispute between Gawker Media and wrestler Hulk Hogan (whose real name is Terry Bolea).
The case, in which Hogan sued Gawker for publishing a sex tape involving him and the wife of his then-best friend, could often seem farcical — part of Hogan/Bolea’s testimony involved the difference between Bolea’s and Hogan’s penis size. At the same time, the lawsuit had real consequences, with Gawker ultimately declaring bankruptcy, selling to Univision and shutting down operations on its flagship Gawker website.
The book will be written by media columnist and author Ryan Holiday. His first book, Trust Me I’m Lying focused on his career doing publicity and marketing for American Apparel and Tucker Max, while more recent titles like Ego Is The Enemy and The Daily Stoic examine how to apply the philosophy of stoicism to modern life and business.
So how did Holiday end up writing about Gawker and Hogan? He said PayPal founder/venture capitalist Peter Thiel (he helped to fund Hogan’s lawsuit) and Gawker founder Nick Denton both sent him unsolicited emails at the end of last year.
Ultimately, Holiday said the book will be based on “dozens of hours” of interviews with Thiel, Denton, Hogan, AJ Daulerio (who published the Hogan footage on Gawker), Hogan’s attorney Charles Harder and others, as well as on the time he’s spent poring over 25,000 pages of legal filings.
While a number of journalists (including me) have written about the troubling implications of a billionaire secretly funding a lawsuit against his enemies in the press, Holiday told me that it’s a mistake to focus on “whether this should have happened or not.”
“The question is how did this happen?” Holiday said. “How did a media company that purports to do investigative journalism miss a conspiracy aimed against it? How did a case that everyone was convinced wouldn’t stand up in court, that was obviously protected by the First Amendment, last through multiple judges and ultimately make it all the way to a verdict? How did Thiel think he would not eventually be discovered and not anticipate the backlash?”
The currently untitled book was acquired by Portfolio’s Niki Papadopoulos for what the publisher said is a “significant” sum. (We’ve heard that the advance was $400,000.) It’s scheduled for release this winter.

Recent reports have indicated that AT&T’s new streaming service, DirecTV Now, may be seeing slowing growth. But don’t count it out just yet. This week, AT&T announced it’s expanding its distribution strategy for the service by bundling in with the wireless carrier’s Unlimited Choice plan for only $10 more per month.
The move is largely meant to entice customers to switch carriers, but it could also help AT&T boost its DirecTV Now subscriber base, by making the add-on of live TV streaming more of a no-brainer for customers.
The same promotion was originally available only in AT&T’s Unlimited Plus plan. That’s the $90 per month plan offering unlimited data, talk and text, high-def video, plus 10 GB of Wi-Fi tethering per phone (with speeds that slow after 22 GB of data usage per line.) Oh, and free HBO. 
The Unlimited Choice plan is a step down from the $60 per month plan, taking into account discounts for autopay and paperless billing. It offers standard-def video and max speed of 3Mbps in addition to unlimited talk, text and data (also with slowed speeds after 22 GB of data.)
The $10 deal for DirecTV Now comes about by discounting the streaming service’s $35 per month entry-level plan, “Live a Live.”
The promotion includes a $25 video credit, essentially making the cost of subscribing to DirecTV Now only $10 per month, on top of your wireless bill.
The “Live a Little” plan is a decent bundle, providing access to over 60 channels, including broadcast networks ABC, NBC, and Fox in select markets, as well as a number of top cable channels, like BBC, AMC, A&E, Bravo, Bloomberg, CNN, CNBC, Comedy Central, Discovery, Disney Channel (including Disney Junior, and XD), E!, ESPN, FX, Lifetime, MTV, Nat Geo, Nickelodeon, Syfy, TBS, TCM, TLC, TNT, VH1, USA, and many others.
DirecTV Now can be streamed via iOS, Android, Amazon Fire TV/Fire TV Stick, Chromecast, and select Roku devices, as well as on the web.
At launch, the service faced a number of glitches, like buffering and freezing issues. It has a basic user interface that may not be breaking new ground, but also isn’t overly designed, like Hulu’s live TV service. It doesn’t have a recording feature and DVR, either. But for $10 per month, it’s easier to overlook these sorts of problems.
However, the $25 video credit doesn’t have to be used towards DirecTV Now, says AT&T. It can also be applied to its TV services, DirecTV or U-verse TV, if you choose.
AT&T invested in mobile video because of the market’s growth, the company says. “Video now makes up more than half of our mobile traffic with 75% growth between 2015 and 2016 alone,” the announcement reads.” We expect video traffic to become a major driver of growth in 2020.”
Perhaps you’d like to visit an out of the way restaurant or smoke a unique cigar. Perhaps you’d like to take part in native dances or infiltrate a foreign government at a classy cocktail party. ViaHero, a new app that lets locals help plan your trips abroad, can help.
The founders, Greg Buzulencia and Ben Preston, have raised $210,000 from investors and Pittsburgh’s AlphaLab accelerator and they have 205 paying customers. Their customers have requested cool trip recommendations from multiple spots around the world so far and the company offers “a more comprehensive experience through end-to-end trip planning and a flexible, yet robust trip guide.”
“We give you everything you need for your trip, not bits and pieces you need to patch together with your own research,” said Buzulencia.
“Greg was planning a trip to Mongolia in 2015, spending countless hours trying to connect with locals to help him plan the off-the-beaten-path experiences he was looking for. He eventually found a local, a man named Canat, who helped him arrange everything he needed for his trip. He was an invaluable resource for planning out the trip, providing personal recommendations, arranging transportation, lodging and answering all of Greg’s questions,” he said. After returning, his co-founder realized that real recommendations from real people is the answer to the problem of finding cool stuff to see and do abroad.
The service finds a local to help you with your planning and can organize cool things to see and do, including offering opportunities to go horseback riding and infiltrate the secret police. Their first customer, Hadassa, used the service to plan a classic convertible ride in downtown Cuba, a lifelong dream. Just think about what sort of fun or rear-door embassy access you could get up to with a local’s help!

CrunchBase Spotlight: Data hints at down rounds, but not wipeout, for marketplace lending



So far, 2017 is shaping up to be a pretty good year for technology unicorns. Private investors are minting about one new unicorn a week this year, roughly the same pace as 2016. More existing unicorns are going public. And for those remaining private, capital continues to flow in while disclosed valuations are mostly holding up.
Overall, at least 24 companies have joined the unicorn club in the first five months of the year, according to the Crunchbase Unicorn Leaderboard, which tracks the universe of private, venture-backed companies valued at $1 billion or more.
In 2016, 50 newcomers joined the board, and 2015 had a record-setting 95 new entrants.

Industries and geographies
This year’s newcomers represent a wide variety of sectors and business models.
There’s fintech (Paytm, a mobile commerce provider, and Robinhood, a zero-commission stock-trading platform), smart building (Katerra, a construction logistics startup and View, maker of smart glass) and bikes (Ofo, a bike-sharing business, and Peloton, maker of exercise cycles and content), to name a few. Of course, there’s also enterprise software (CrowdStrike, for cybersecurity, and Symphony, a corporate messaging platform) and consumer internet (question-and-answer sites Quora and Zhihu). See the full list here.
Unicorns based on geography are less varied. The overwhelming majority of new entrants to the billion-dollar-valuation list hail from either the United States or China. In the U.S., there were 13 new unicorns, while China produced at least eight so far this year. India and the U.K. each had one.

Historically, the lion’s share of unicorns have been U.S.- or China-based, so 2017 doesn’t represent a notable deviation from the norm. Out of 231 companies on the unicorn board, 121 are headquartered in the U.S. and 66 are based in China.
Finding the exit
While newcomers are joining the unicorn board, longstanding members are going public or selling to acquirers. IPOs, in particular, are up, with the sums raised far exceeding 2016 levels.
So far this year, at least five companies on the unicorn board have gone public: Snap, Cloudera, Okta, MuleSoft and China Rapid Finance. By comparison, there were five unicorn IPOs in all of 2016.

The biggest year-over-year rise, however, is in the amount of capital raised through unicorn IPOs. This is primarily due to a single company, Snap, which carried out the largest tech offering in years with its March market debut. Snap’s offering alone included a sale of $3.4 billion in shares, more than all the 2016 unicorn IPOs combined. And while Snap shares are down from their initial post-IPO price, the company still has a hefty $25 billion valuation.
Two of this year’s enterprise software unicorn IPOs, Okta and MuleSoft, also performed well, with both trading above their last private market valuations. Data analytics provider Alteryx, a near-unicorn, also did well in its IPO.
Yet not all newly public companies maintained or exceeded their prior private market valuations. Enterprise software provider Cloudera priced shares for its May offering at about half the value they commanded in a funding round led by Intel three years earlier. (Cloudera has been a strong post-IPO performer, however, with shares up about 50 percent from the IPO price and a valuation around $2.9 billion.) Another one-time unicorn, loan provider China Rapid Finance, remains well below the $1 billion threshold after its April IPO.
We’ve also seen some acquisitions. AppDynamics, which sold to Cisco for $3.7 billion, was by far the biggest. Next came Souq, the Middle Eastern online retailer, which sold to Amazon for $650 million — well below its peak private valuation.
Up and down valuations
Along with the 24 new unicorns, companies already on the list were significantly more likely to have a reported increase in valuation than a decline when raising funding. China’s Didi Chuxing showed the largest rise with a $44.5 billion pre-money valuation in 2017, up from $33.6 billion in 2016.
A couple of food delivery unicorns also posted big valuation gains. Germany’s Delivery Hero raised $420 million at a $2.7 billion valuation, nearly doubling from two years ago. U.S.-based Instacart, meanwhile, raised $400 million at a $3 billion valuation, up more than 50 percent from its last round in 2015.
The two notable exceptions are two India-based unicorns, Flipkart and Ola. Flipkart, the leading online retailer, last raised in 2015 at $14.3 pre-money, is down to $10.2 pre-money in its latest round. Ola, the ride-hailing app, is also down from $4.5 billion pre-money to $3.2 billion in its more recent 2017 round.
Unicorn bulls
Overall, 2017 funding trends offer some fodder for both unicorn bulls and those who have warned of overvaluation. In some cases, acquirers and public markets are insisting on a discount from prior private valuations.
However, it’s also clear that private and public market investors continue to support high and rising values for category leaders and other favored companies.

Pulling out of the Paris agreement on climate change will become one of the greatest economic blunders by a U.S. president in our lifetimes.
People can disagree about the scientific premise behind climate change, but it’s an inescapable fact that the world is driving ahead to replace carbon energy with clean energy anyway. That makes advanced energy technologies one of the biggest business opportunities of the next couple of decades. The companies and nations that take the lead will become the next economic superpowers.
President Trump said that he is pulling out of the agreement because it would cost American jobs. But while he might save a relatively small number of coal and oil jobs, he is harming the nation’s chances to create vast numbers of advanced energy jobs. 
Many coal and oil jobs are eventually doomed anyway — those industries have a limited future as the world leaves carbon behind. Advanced energy jobs will multiply year after year. If the U.S. doesn’t capture that work, other nations will.

Companies gain market leadership because they thrive on local markets first and then become global. This is what happened in China with solar panel manufacturing — the government spent heavily to create a local market for the technology.
It pumped $89.5 billion into the industry in 2015 alone, and in January 2017 its National Energy Administration announced it would spend $360 billion through 2020 on renewable energy. As Chinese companies have perfected the process and scaled up manufacturing, they were in position to dominate solar panels around the world. Today the three biggest solar makers are based in China: Trina Solar, JinkoSolar and JA Solar. 
If ending our participation in the Paris Accord slows the U.S. advanced energy market, our American companies will be at a huge competitive disadvantage globally. They won’t have a robust local market to build on. Before long, we will find ourselves buying energy technology from other countries, just as other countries now soak up our digital tech products. 
Worse, the damage can go beyond energy to all U.S. industry. New energy sources aren’t getting adopted just because they might stave off climate change — they’re getting adopted because they are becoming cheaper than carbon-based energy. 
Solar is on a trajectory that echoes Moore’s Law, which explained why computers got twice as powerful for the same price every 18 months for decades. The cost of solar has dropped 95 percent since the 1980s while efficiency has rocketed. And solar farms, with acres of solar panels laid out in a sunny climate, can be the most efficient of all.

With today’s technology, solar panels covering just a few counties in Texas could supply all the electricity needed for the entire United States. In May, California on some days generated 80 percent of the total power used in the state with renewable sources — because it has become cheaper than carbon.
So if the U.S. falls behind in advanced energy and our companies instead rely on carbon, eventually U.S. business will be operating at a higher cost than competitors around the world that rely on clean sources. 
Anticipating Trump’s announcement, in early May, 25 major U.S. companies — including Apple, Facebook, Mars Incorporated and Morgan Stanley — published a full-page letter in several newspapers that read: “By expanding markets for innovative clean technologies, the agreement generates jobs and economic growth. U.S. companies are well positioned to lead in these markets. Withdrawing from the agreement will limit our access to them and could expose us to retaliatory measures.”

Competing nations already know that Trump’s actions spell opportunity. Chinese premier Li Keqiang, visiting Germany, said his country would remain committed to combating climate change. 
European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker declared: “The vacuum that would be created has to be filled, and Europe has aspirations for a natural leadership in this whole process.”
At least U.S. companies have pushed ahead despite the Trump Administration’s rhetoric. Walmart, which installs solar panels on the rooftops of its stores, announced it intends to operate on 100 percent solar, and Google, which in 2016 consumed as much energy as the whole city of San Francisco, said that by the end of 2017 all its data centers globally will run entirely on renewable energy.
The best news about Trump’s action is that it will take four years to get out of the Paris Accord, so the final decision would land about the time of the next presidential election. Between now and then, U.S. industry has to send a clear message: our economic future lies in leading the world away from carbon. Otherwise, we will surely wind up as followers.

On YouTube, you have to either know what it is you watch to watch and seek it out, or you can click through the site’s suggestions of popular or trending content. A startup called Rheo, founded by ex-Apple product veterans, has a different take on video discovery. Instead of browsing by genre, publisher or chart position, viewers can browse by mood. That is, you can seek out videos to make you laugh, those that inform you, those that instruct or teach, those for times you want to chill, and more.
Previously available as an Apple TV application, Rheo this week expanded to both iOS and the web.
Rheo was created by Alan Cannistraro, an Apple product development veteran who previously spent 12 years at Apple working on apps like Remote, iBooks, and Podcasts. He later joined Facebook, where he worked on News Feed, Facebook’s iOS autoplay video feature, and Facebook’s Creative Labs, which built experimental apps like Slingshot, Rooms, and Riff.
Co-founder Charles Migos, meanwhile, worked at Apple for over a decade, where he created Apple News, as well as Microsoft, where he designed the company’s home media experience. Migos joined Rheo in the first half of 2016.

“This idea has been churning in my head for years,” explains Cannistraro, describing how he came up with Rheo. “I’ve picked up pieces along the way: learning how we interact with video from my time on Final Cut; thinking about how entertainment, mobile devices, and the home all fit together from when I built the first iOS app: Remote; understanding the attraction that people have to move images over text, from my time building autoplay video at Facebook,” he says.
This all solidified for Cannistraro one night in 2015 when he was traveling, he says. Exhausted, he checked into his hotel room and turned on the TV, hoping to relax. But instead of being able to just wind down, Cannistraro realized that the television’s interface forces you to browse through a massive grid of content first – and this interface has carried over to today’s online video services, as well.
“Two days later, I quit my job and knew what I had to do,” says Cannistraro.
On Rheo, you pick a channel to watch based on what type of mood you’re in – in terms of what you want to watch, that is – and the app then personalizes the content to you using a variety of other factors.
For example, Rheo’s “Laugh” channel is for comedy; “Inform” offers news coverage; “Spark” features creative content from artists, designers and musicians; “Learn” is for educational content; “Chill” is music; and “Move” offers action sports.

These short-form videos are played in a stream that’s further customized by things like what time of day it is, your interests, what’s trending on Rheo, as well as your own behavior – meaning, what you’ve previously watched, skipped, boosted (a vote up type mechanism), and shared to social networks.
The promise is that the more you watch on Rheo, the more personalized your video streams will become as the service adapts to your input and actions.
In addition, the new Rheo iOS app introduces a social networking component. You can record your reactions to videos you watch, and these reactions will then appear in your friends’ streams. These personal videos are also saved to your “Reel” in Rheo. Friends who visit your profile can view your video channel with all your shared reactions.

The content on Rheo comes from public sources, like Facebook and Twitter (via API), as well as formal partnerships, like Vimeo and Refinery 29.
The nine-person, San Francisco-based startup isn’t currently focused on revenue generation, they tell us, but they previously raised $2.3 million in seed funding last year.

While Rheo will be challenged to attract users in a world where larger video platforms, like YouTube already exist, Cannistraro believes its curation element fills a void in the market – much like how Spotify’s “Discover Weekly” playlist of personalized content helped give it the edge.
“The long-term vision of Rheo goes far beyond being a video player. Instead, we think about media as an integral part of our environment,” Cannistraro adds. “Navigating apps, menus, channels, titles, etc, takes effort and attention,” he says. “The next few years will see us move towards media being available ambiently, as effortlessly accessible as a glance at your microwave or alarm clock to tell the time, and contextually tailored to you.”
Google Home is now available to pre-order for Canadians. Google had announced at I/O this year that it would be coming to the country this summer, but now the smart home speaker with Google Assistant built-in is available on Google’s own online store, as well as at retail partners including Best Buy.
In Canada, Google Home is selling for $179.00 CDN, which is actually pretty much in line with U.S. pricing once you factor in the current currency conversion rate. The shipping time for the Google Home is listed at “2-3 weeks” for customers on Google’s own online store, and Google’s official blog says the in-store release date is June 26. Best Buy is also offering a free Chromecast with pre-orders for the Google Home, and it’ll also be available at Bell, Indigo, London Drugs, Rogers, Telus, Staples, The Source and Walmart.
Google officially launched Home in the U.S. on November 4, and it became available in the U.K. on April 6, 2017. The speaker offers built-in support for Google’s virtual assistant, which can integrate with services and smart home devices and which responds to voice queries made by the user. It also features swappable base accent colors, and can work with Chromecast Audio and Cast-enabled speaker devices for whole-home synchronized audio streaming.
Google Home is the search giant’s answer to Amazon’s Echo, which houses its Alexa assistant and which pioneered the home smart speaker category. Home is also launching in Australia, France, Germany and Japan this summer.
Alphabet-owned Waymo, the autonomous driving technology that began life as Google’s self-driving car project, is evaluating a move into self-driving trucking. The company told BuzzFeed that it’s currently conducting a “technical exploration” of how its “technology can integrate into a truck,” a test which involves use of a single truck, being driven only by people in order to collect data at this stage.
Waymo has not talked about any specific interest in the world of autonomous trucking prior to now, but one of its former employees, Anthony Levandowski, founded a self-driving transport trucking company called Otto upon his departure. Levandowski’s company was acquired by Uber, which put the former Google employee in charge of its self-driving engineering operations, but he was fired earlier this week for continually refusing to comply with Uber’s own internal investigation related to a Waymo suit that accused him of stealing Google employees and trade secrets.
Self-driving trucking is considered one of the lower-hanging fruits of the self-driving industry, since it involves relatively uncomplicated navigation of long stretches of highway driving. A hybrid model, in which a human driver is still present and ready to take over once trucks enter city driving scenarios, is a popular option being pursued in the sector as a way to make practical commercial use of the technology much more easily attainable. A startup called Embark recently debuted with this model, and is approved to test autonomous truck tech on Nevada roads.
Waymo recently kicked off public trials of an on-demand autonomous ride hailing service in Phoenix, Arizona, using its current generation self-driving Chrysler Pacifica hybrid minivans.

Hello and welcome back to Equity, TechCrunch’s premier venture capital-focused podcast.
This week the News Gods disbursed unto the crew a juicy morsel: Blue Apron filed to go public minutes before we sat down to chew over what’s been happening. As you can imagine, it took up a chunk of our time.
But no episode of Equity is complete without our own Katie Roof, Matthew Lynley, myself — Alex Wilhelm — and a fresh victim, or guest, depending on your perspective. This week Ted Smith, an M&A banker and co-founder of Union Square Advisors, sat with us to dive into the news, and try to figure out what the hell is going on with Travis and company.
Yes, we took a dive into the recently disclosed Uber financials, which showed booming bookings, quick revenue growth, and persistently staggering — albeit partially diminished — adjusted losses.
All that and we still had a minute of time to take a gossip at the U.S. M&A market and what we might anticipate for the rest of 2017. Hint: dollars.
Equity drops every Friday at 6:00 am PT, so subscribe to us on iTunes, Overcast, Pocketcast, Downcast and all the casts.
Fine timepieces are usually staid affairs. A little gold here, some enamel here, and a nice movement are enough to please some of us but it’s clear that a minority need hand-cut crystal domes, scurrying aliens, and enough luminous material to make a deep-sea angler fish jealous.
The new MB&F HM6 is a version of Max Busser’s popular Horological Machine series but features a few futuristic touches. The watch case is made entirely of sapphire crystal and features six tiny aliens – including a driver – that clamor all over the inside of the piece. The watch is limited to four pieces in four colors and costs $500,000 – enough to send one of these things to the moon if necessary.

From the release:

￼Each of the six aliens is individually modelled and hand-sculpted in white gold by engraver Olivier Kuhn. The arms and necks of the aliens are finer than grains of sand, each alien requiring up to 34 hours to complete. Count more than a month of full-time work for the crew of six.
As would befit spacecraft coming from an alien civilisation with highly sophisticated technology, HM6 Alien Nation is completely transparent, being formed entirely of sapphire crystal with reinforcing elements in Grade-5 titanium. To be precise, 12 separate blocks of sapphire crystal requiring up to 510 hours of machining and polishing. During the process, breakage is unfortunately frequent, often reducing hundreds of hours of work to zero… And then comes the assembly: the 12 crystals must come together perfectly to present a seamless whole.

Why should you care about this watch? Well, if you had a liquidity event maybe you can pick one of these up and, more important, its one of the purest representations of the modern watchmakers art. Think of this less as a watch and more like a handmade piece of wearable art and you’ve got a general idea why these things cost so much. They’re completely handmade and the work put into every detail – from the case to the aliens – is a direct affront to today’s disposable society.
Sadly this little watch can’t fly but it can, if you want, take you to the depths of despair if you break the neck off one of the tiny little aliens protruding from the case.
Back when I was a kid, my parents gave me cash as part of my allowance or whenever I ever needed to make a purchase at the mall. But these days, who uses cash or has it lying around?
For parents today, a company called Greenlight is offering a smart debit card that can be given to their kids, instantly reloaded with funds from a mobile app, and place restrictions around merchants their children can make purchases.
After less than six months in market, the company has already signed up 10,000 paying customers and has attracted $7.5 million in funding from investors that include Relay Ventures, Social Capital, New Enterprise Associates (NEA) and TTV Capital. Greenlight plans to use that funding to expand its team and invest in attracting more customers with its smart debit card.
Greenlight co-founder and CEO Tim Sheehan began working on the startup to solve his own problem — that is, being able to give his kids money to spend when he didn’t have cash on hand. After surveying other parents, he found this problem wasn’t exactly unique, and that parents were also looking for ways to teach their kids financial responsibility while also having a better view of how they were spending money.
With Greenlight parents can give their kids debit cards that provide unprecedented control and transparency into how and where they are used. By combining the cards with a mobile app that provides account information as well as transaction data,
For a low monthly fee, parents can instantly transfer cash to their children’s cards, get alerts when children make purchases, and set store-level controls around where children can make purchases. It also provides easy ways for parents to automatically fund allowances or freeze cards if they’re lost or stolen.
The service is aimed at families that have kids aged 8 through 18. It costs $4.99 per month and includes up to five debit cards per family. It’s easier and in most cases, a cheaper alternative to setting up individual bank accounts for each child, which can come with age restrictions, balance requirements and hidden fees.
Greenlight makes its money off that monthly subscription as well as interchange fees that it makes from all transactions made with a card. But there are no additional ATM or transaction fees for users.
Important news for Switch owners, Nintendo has spoken up to confirm a number of details around the online service for its new console.
Online is an essential component to gaming these days, and the Switch service will grant subscribers access to a library of classic games as well as unlocking the option to play with friends online, set up game appointments and chat. The second half of the feature set will come via a compatible mobile app, however, rather than being integrated into the Switch itself, but we already knew that.
Price-wise, the Nintendo Switch Online service will come in at $19.99 per year when it launches fully in 2018. There will also be $3.99 per month and $7.99 per three month options for those who are more reluctant to commit. Those figures are in line with the company’s previously announced pricing estimate. They also make the service some degree cheaper than the equivalents for Xbox and PlayStation, although Nintendo has traditionally offered up online services for free.
Ahead of the full launch, Nintendo will make a limited version available for free. That’ll include the mobile app, which is scheduled for release this summer.
Finally, it’s worth noting that Nintendo made a welcomed change to its package. Initially, it had planned to give online subscribers access to just one classic title each month, however it confirmed to Kotaku that this proposed limitation has been scraped.
Here’s what Nintendo said in full:

Nintendo Switch Online subscribers will have ongoing access to a library of classic games with added online play. Users can play as many of the games as they want, as often as they like, as long as they have an active subscription.
Nintendo Switch Online subscribers will be able to play a wide variety of classic games, including Super Mario Bros. 3, Balloon Fight and Dr. Mario. More games will be announced at a later date. At launch the classic game library will include NES games. Super NES games continue to be under consideration, but we have nothing further to announce at this time.

LG announced plans for its own mobile payment service way back in November 2015, and today it finally went official with the launch.
The LG Pay service is initially limited to the G6, LG’s flagship smartphone, via a software update, but it is only available in Korea. There is launch support for cards from Shinhan Bank, KB, BC and Lotte, and LG plans to cover all of Korea’s card companies by September.
The primary focus of the service — like rival offerings from Apple, Samsung and Google — is offline point-of-sale. LG Pay requires a user’s fingerprint to process every transaction. It uses magnetic signals to enable a mobile device to communicate with a regular credit card terminal in order to make the payment. That’s the same technique used with Samsung Pay.
Users can store up to 10 cards within the service — including store loyalty cards and specific retail cards — but payment itself is made by a ‘virtual’ card number to improve privacy and keep user data safer. Beyond providing payment at point-of-sale, LG revealed that it is working to support online payments and other banking services.
An LG representative told us that there’s current no update on when, or indeed whether, LG Pay will become available outside of Korea. That’s the company’s primary focus for sales, and the country where it has the most significant marketshare, which makes it an obvious starting point. But with LG Pay badly lagging competitors such as Apple Pay, Android Pay and Samsung Pay — which got a significant head start — and overtaken on the sales front by a range of companies, it may not make sense to ever take LG Pay overseas. We shall see.
‘House Of Cards’ is back streaming on Netflix with its fifth series, but another Netflix Original created around the same time as the political blockbuster is being put out to pasture. ‘Sense8,’ which the streaming company announced with much fanfare in 2013, is not returning to the service after two seasons.
The title was the first TV production for the Wachowski siblings, whose past work includes The Matrix among other things, and it was heralded as one of the most progressive sci-fi dramas to date.
Netflix’s VP of original content, Cindy Holland, delivered the news on the company blog:
“After 23 episodes, 16 cities and 13 countries, the story of the Sense8 cluster is coming to an end. It is everything we and the fans dreamed it would be: bold, emotional, stunning, kick ass, and outright unforgettable. Never has there been a more truly global show with an equally diverse and international cast and crew, which is only mirrored by the connected community of deeply passionate fans all around the world. We thank Lana, Lilly, Joe and Grant for their vision, and the entire cast and crew for their craftsmanship and commitment.”
Already fans are staging a blacklash. The company isn’t giving any more details on why, but CEO Reid Hastings indicated in an interview with CNBC this week that it needs to take more risks with its content if it is to unearth future blockbusters.
“I’m always pushing the content team, we have to take more risk, you have to try more crazy things, because we should have a higher cancel rate overall,” he said. “Because then, what you get is you get some winners that are just unbelievable.”
Hastings said viral smash ’13 Reasons Why’ is one such risk-gone-good that justifies a more adventurous approach over caution.
‘Sense8’ isn’t the only recent high-profile cancellation. ‘The Get Down’ from Baz Luhrmann, was dropped after just a single series in a move made last week.

Snap’s Spectacles are going on a summer tour across Europe. Starting today, anyone in Europe can buy a pair of sunglasses on Snap’s website or in a vending machine. With this launch, Spectacles are available outside of the U.S. for the first time.
European Spectacles are exactly the same as the ones that launched in September 2016 in the U.S. While the excitement around Spectacles has been a bit more quiet in the U.S., Snap has been slow when it comes to rolling out its first hardware product.
At first, it was only available in weirdly shaped vending machines. It was a great marketing tool, but it also meant that it was hard to get your hands on a pair. Since February, anyone has been able to buy a pair on Spectacles.com.
In Europe, Snap is launching Spectacles simultaneously on its website and in a bunch of vending machines. Customers in Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Spain, Finland, France, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Switzerland, Sweden and the U.K. can now buy a pair for €149.99 or £129.99.
But Snap also wants to celebrate the launch in real life. You’ll be able to spot vending machines in London, Paris, Berlin, Barcelona and Venice today.
Those vending machines won’t stay around for long as the plan is to move them around the U.K., France, Germany, Spain and Italy this summer. So don’t be surprised if you see a big bright yellow box next to your favorite beach.
Spectacles are basically sunglasses with a tiny camera. You press a button, and it records 10 to 30 seconds of video. You can then find the footage in the Snapchat app on your phone, making it easy to share those videos with your Snapchat friends or keep them in the Memories section.
Following a backlash around brand advertising on controversial content, YouTube is making a move to clean up which videos are part of its ad network.
The Google-owned has updated the guidelines that govern which YouTube videos can run ads to prevent previous mismatches and assuage both its community of video makers and advertisers. High-profile YouTubers were up in arms last year after the website determined that some content of the more controversial end of the scale was not suitable for advertising following complaints from brands. The issue spilled over into 2017, after Disney and others cut ties with prolific YouTube star Pew Die Pie over his use of anti-Semitic content in some videos.
“We’ve heard loud and clear from the creator community and from advertisers that YouTube needs to broaden our advertiser-friendly guidelines around a few additional types of content,” Ariel Bardin, YouTube VP of product management, wrote in a blog post.
Chiefly, the video site will not show advertising against “hateful” content that “promotes discrimination or disparages or humiliates an individual or group of people,” it said. Also barred from running ads are videos that involve “family entertainment characters” engaging in inappropriate behavior, and those that carry messages that demean or are incendiary.
Here are the top level details in full:

Hateful content: Content that promotes discrimination or disparages or humiliates an individual or group of people on the basis of the individual’s or group’s race, ethnicity, or ethnic origin, nationality, religion, disability, age, veteran status, sexual orientation, gender identity, or other characteristic associated with systematic discrimination or marginalization.
Inappropriate use of family entertainment characters: Content that depicts family entertainment characters engaged in violent, sexual, vile, or otherwise inappropriate behavior, even if done for comedic or satirical purposes.
Incendiary and demeaning content: Content that is gratuitously incendiary, inflammatory, or demeaning. For example, video content that uses gratuitously disrespectful language that shames or insults an individual or group.

To be clear, videos that fall into the categories above will be able to exist on YouTube — so long as they do not infringe the site’s terms and conditions — but the YouTubers behind them simply won’t be able to monetize them via the site’s advertising platform.
As is commonplace when dealing with user-generated content networks of serious scale, we’ll have to wait and see how the policies are enforced to know the practical impact, but it is high time that YouTube took a firm stance on this issue — both for advertisers and content makers.
“While it’s not possible for us to cover every video scenario, we hope this additional information will provide you with more insight into the types of content that brands have told us they don’t want to advertise against and help you to make more informed content decisions,” YouTube’s Bardin wrote.

Donald Trump took to the White House Rose Garden this afternoon to announce his plans to withdraw the U.S. from the Paris climate agreement, and reactions from the leaders of some of the world’s biggest companies have been pouring in since.
Within hours, Tesla CEO Elon Musk followed up on his promise to depart the president’s advisory team if we withdrew. Shortly thereafter, Disney CEO Bob Iger announced he’d do the same.
Apple CEO Tim Cook responded by penning a letter to his employees. In the letter, Cook outlines Apple’s efforts to shift to renewable energy and cut back on the mining of rare earth materials, pledging that “today’s development will have no impact on Apple’s efforts to protect the environment.”
He also notes that he spoke with President Trump two days prior to the announcement and “tried to persuade him” not to withdraw, but “it wasn’t enough.”
Here’s the full text of the letter as obtained by TechCrunch:

Team,
I know many of you share my disappointment with the White House’s decision to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate agreement. I spoke with President Trump on Tuesday and tried to persuade him to keep the U.S. in the agreement. But it wasn’t enough.
Climate change is real and we all share a responsibility to fight it. I want to reassure you that today’s developments will have no impact on Apple’s efforts to protect the environment. We power nearly all of our operations with renewable energy, which we believe is an example of something that’s good for our planet and makes good business sense as well.
We will keep working toward the ambitious goals of a closed-loop supply chain, and to eventually stop mining new materials altogether. Of course, we’re going to keep working with our suppliers to help them do more to power their businesses with clean energy. And we will keep challenging ourselves to do even more. Knowing the good work that we and countless others around the world are doing, there are plenty of reasons to be optimistic about our planet’s future.
Our mission has always been to leave the world better than we found it. We will never waver, because we know that future generations depend on us.
Your work is as important today as it has ever been. Thank you for your commitment to making a difference every single day.
Tim

OneLogin, a major access management service (think corporate-level password manager) alerted its users yesterday of “unauthorized access” to the data of its US-based users. That kind of thing isn’t always serious… but it turns out this one sure was. An update posted today reveals the hacker may have had very deep access indeed.
“Our review has shown that a threat actor obtained access to a set of AWS keys…Through the AWS API, the actor created several instances in our infrastructure to do reconnaissance,” read the company blog post detailing the attack.
“The threat actor was able to access database tables that contain information about users, apps, and various types of keys. While we encrypt certain sensitive data at rest, at this time we cannot rule out the possibility that the threat actor also obtained the ability to decrypt data.”
An email reportedly sent to users was more succinct:

The U.S. is buttressing its paperwork walls with new requirements for social media disclosures as part of revised visa applications.
Reported by Reuters earlier today, the decision from the U.S. government’s Office of Management and Budget was made over strenuous objections from education and academic groups during a public comment period.
The new questionnaire will ask for social media handles dating back over the last five years and biographical information dating back 15 years.
For critics, the new questionnaire represents yet another obstacle that the government is putting in the path of potential immigrants, would-be students and qualified researchers and teachers that may otherwise want to come to the United States.
Check out the new visa questionnaire here.
Quoting an unnamed State Department official, Reuters reported that the additional information would only be requested when the department determines that “such information is required to confirm identity or conduct more rigorous national security vetting.”
In an earlier Reuters report, the news service quoted an immigration attorney railing against the new procedures:

“What this language effectively does is give the consular posts permission to step away from the focused factors they have spent years developing and revising, and instead broaden the search to large groups based on gross factors such as nationality and religion,” Gairson said.

Our Spark is returning to DJI a bit worse for wear. As a rule, we try to send products back to companies in the same state they arrived, but that’s a hazard of real-world testing a product with four spinning blades: sometimes things end up covered in dirt and grass and the sacrificial blood of one poor TC staff member.
The Spark is, at once, an impressive feat of engineering and a reminder that drones are a ways from being true mainstream devices. It’s DJI’s smallest and cheapest drone by far, and the company also has tossed in some neat gesture control tricks that make you feel like Luke Skywalker for the 16 minutes it’s in the air. But there are still a lot of kinks to work out.
The gesture control is tough to learn, for one thing. And drones in general have a fair bit of regulation to contend with. Also, even with safety controls in place, some blood may still be shed, as our video producer Veanne learned when she sacrificed her Memorial Day weekend and a small bit of her middle finger to take the Spark for a spin.
That came from a mishap attempting to grab the drone after a flight. There was also a Charlie Brown-style incident that ended with the Spark caught in a tree (though, to our credit, we managed to avoid birdhouses altogether this time out). All of that despite the fact that Veanne is a seasoned videographer with some drone-flying experience.
Even so, the Spark is a good candidate for those who have been eyeing a drone, but don’t have the funds or technical skill to pilot a high-end rig. DJI knows how to build a solid quadcopter, and the Spark mostly fits that bill. But any suggestion that we’re getting to a point where drones are as easy to operate as, say, an iPhone is woefully overstated.
Courting Spark



It’s pretty safe to say we were in awe when the Spark debuted recently. It had been about half a year since the Mavic Pro first started shipping, and here was DJI introducing something even smaller. The demo went off without a hitch and people started tossing around terms like “game changer” to describe the new product.
And it really is an impressive little device. The Spark weighs a full pound less than the Mavic and is roughly half its size. You really can hold it in the palm of your hand.Though unlike the earlier model, the new drone has fixed arms, so it’s roughly the same size as the Mavic is when its arms are folded into its body.
The smaller size comes with some compromises, however. The camera and the gimbal have been downgraded. Among other things, you can’t shoot 4K video with the drone. Though, given the consumer audience the company is targeting, that’s probably not that big of a loss for most.
Battery life is really the biggest downside on that front. The company rates it at 16 minutes. That’s a bit more than half what the Mavic can do on a charge. The batteries are, thankfully, swappable, and a USB port on the Spark lets you charge the battery by plugging a cable directly into the drone. Though, as we learned the hard way: If you do end up buying the Spark, definitely add a second battery ($49) to your shopping cart — you’re going to need it..text .crunchreport h3 {color:#fff}

Gonna fly now

Here’s our intrepid producer, Veanne: “Sixteen minutes of flight time seems like ample time to fly the drone, but not so much when you’re still trying to figure it out.” I think “ample” may be a strong word here, depending on what you plan to do with the drone — and that estimate is toward the higher end of what you’ll get in real-world usage — but you get the point. There’s a learning curve that takes more than 16 minutes to get a handle on.
There’s a lot happening under the hood, and the fact that DJI was able to build a device that can move based on arm swings and take pictures when a user makes a frame with their fingers is impressive. That the company packed those features into a $499 drone makes it even more so. But like our birdhouse run-in with the Mavic last year, we ran into some issues keeping the drone out of trouble.
There’s a noticeable delay between making a palm gesture and the corresponding drone movement. And in a few cases, the Spark seemed to behave erratically based on a simple gesture. In one instance, the drone’s camera seemed to lose track of the pilot and could only be righted by taking control with the app.
For the most part, the drone’s obstacle avoidance works as advertised, with the drone stopping and hovering in place before colliding with an object. For the most part.

“On the second day of testing in the park, Spark was halfway flying backwards in Quickshot mode when it encountered some trees,” says Veanne. “The logical thing to do, at least I thought at the time, was to press the ‘Return to Home’ button. Problem was, Spark will ascend before it descends. In this case, it ascended right into the trees and then crashed into the ground, now missing a propeller guard.”
So, that’s how we lost a propeller guard and gained an extra coat of dirt. As for the blood, that part came thanks to a botched landing.
A Spark in the hand

The coolest thing about the Spark being palm-sized is that you can use said palms as launch and landing pads. Neat, right?

There are, naturally, some safety features on board. DJI lists a dozen in all, designed to help users avoid the spinning blades of doom, including one that shuts the propellers off when it detects that an object is getting too close. But poor Veanne still managed to get caught in the crossfire when attempting to pull off one of the built-in features.
Veanne again: “I was told that if you grab Spark by the bottom and flip it 90 degrees [during DJI’s demo], its propellers would stop spinning. Just as I reached up to grab the drone, it spun out of control and my fingers got caught in the propellers.”
Ouch.
Red tape

Some other takeaways from a few days’ worth of testing in New York City:

Flying is hard in the big city, for myriad reasons. And it seems to be something of a legal gray era. Or, rather, it’s a bit of a mixed bag as to whether authorities will hassle you for doing so. Either way, it’s best to avoid crowds at all costs.
The app has a built-in warning feature that lets you know when you’re in a no-fly zone. And from the looks of things, that applies to basically all of Brooklyn.
The drone needs a lot of space, particularly for modes like Quickshot, which creates a 10-second video designed for sharing on social.
It’s small, but it’s loud. It’s got that lawnmower-style buzz that Veanne helpfully compares to “killer bees.” If you’re flying it around people trying to enjoy a quiet picnic in the park, prepare to be that asshole.

A gateway drone

Truly mastering the drone takes more than a couple of days of testing, of course. But that brings into sharp relief the fact that the Spark isn’t really the beginner’s product it might have seemed at first. The simple fact of the matter, though, is that such a device doesn’t really exist yet. The promise of pulling out a drone for a quick selfie is still years out.
The Spark does feel like a step closer, however — $499 is an easier pill to swallow for those who have been eyeing drone ownership for a while. And the device’s slew of different tricks will keep owners entertained once they’ve got a handle on the control system. Thankfully, there’s a pretty robust warranty system in place, as you work through the process.
And, of course, be careful where you grab. On that note, a parting message from Veanne, “Dear DJI, I will be returning the Spark covered in dirt and grass and minus a propeller guard. I apologize, but we did wipe off the blood beforehand.”

What do popular dating apps and brick-and-mortar storefronts have in common? Until now, nothing.
But that’s about to change, as Bumble, the popular female-led dating app, is opening a pop-up location in New York City.
Bumble is calling the space the Hive, and it will be a month-long installment designed to be a space for dates, Bumble fans and really anyone — to just hang out and soak in the Bumble brand.
The space is really decked out in Bumble’s unique flavor — click through the album below to see the space.

A physical location is the first step in the dating startup’s attempt to formalize the community that has naturally formed around the Bumble brand. While some dating apps are still considered taboo, Whitney Wolfe, founder and CEO of Bumble, explained that Bumble’s brand now extends beyond just dating, and is something people are proud to associate themselves with — even if they aren’t necessarily using Bumble for dating.
This focus on community also meshes with the startup’s plans to eventually expand on BumbleBIZZ, which is Bumble’s attempt to help users with professional and social networking, and retain users who may not necessarily be looking to date.
While the space will be open during the week for couples to meet up (or friends to just stop in and check it out), there will also be a series of events focused on relationships, female entrepreneurship and more. For example, Bumble founder Whitney Wolfe will host a panel with the founders of theSkimm, Drybar will be hosting style sessions and Forbes will be hosting a Mentor & Mingle session.

The space will also have a coffee (and real) bar, as well as Bumble merchandise for sale (where all proceeds go to charity).
Bumble said the current plans are to keep it open for a month, but isn’t ruling out the opportunity for an extension, or potential expansions into other cities.
The Hive will be located in Soho at 158 Mercer Street, and will be open Thursday – Friday 8am-2pm and 4pm-10pm, Saturdays from 10am-2pm and 4pm-10pm, and all day Sunday from 10am-8pm.  Check out the event page here for more details.

Tomer Dean is a serial tech entrepreneur currently based in Tel Aviv. He is co-founder and CEO of Bllush.

I recently had a meeting with a well-known Israeli startup investor. The talk somehow pivoted from my seed-seeking startup into talking about the macro view of venture capital and how it doesn’t actually make sense.
“Ninety-five percent of VCs aren’t profitable,” he said. It took me a while to understand what this really means.
I’ll clarify: Ninety-five percent of VCs aren’t actually returning enough money to justify the risk, fees and illiquidity their investors (LPs) are taking on by investing in their funds.
Who’s actually succeeding in making money?
A VC fund needs a 3x return to achieve a “venture rate of return” and be considered a good investment ($100 million fund => 3x => $300 million return). The graph below shows what percentage of VC firms accomplish this. As we can see, only the small green slice is bringing it home. The other 95 percent are juggling somewhere between breaking even and downright losing money (remember to adjust for inflation).
Source:  Money Talks, Gil Ben-Artzy
The graph was hard for me to take in at first. But once you run the numbers, it all makes sense. I’ll attempt to reconstruct the arguments leading to this hard-to-grasp realization of an industry so often idealized from the outside. Ready? Let’s have some fun.
Assumptions
Before starting, let’s define what success and failure actually mean and list our assumptions:
Success = 12 percent return per year
Venture capitals get their money from limited partners, who are usually traditional investors such as banks, institutions, pension funds, etc. In their eyes, throwing $50 million into a startup fund is “risky” business compared to their other options, such as the stock market/real estate, which are lower cost, liquid and could “safely” return 7-8 percent per year. For them, 12 percent return on their money per year is good. Anything below that? Not worth the high risk they’re taking.
That brings us to…
A 10-year fund needs to return 3x the fund size
We agreed VCs need to earn 12 percent return a year, right? Most funds, while only actively investing 3-5 years, are bound to 10 years. Many newer studies are showing that 12-14 year funds are more accurate for today, but let’s stick with 10 just to give the VCs a fighting chance. That annual 12 percent rapidly grows, showing the power of compounded interest. Let’s see the math:

Don’t forget Pareto: 80 percent of returns come from 20 percent of startups
Facts of life are that startups are hard. Breaking even is hard. Profits are hard. Keeping profits growing year over year (YoY) is even harder. Out of 10 companies, only two will really explode and IPO/M&A, giving our dear VCs some of their money back. The rest, as we’ll see, will fizzle out and die — or have a small liquidation event, which is pretty much the same.
Let’s start
So we have 10 startups and a fund that needs to return 3x within 10 years. Let’s assume it’s a $100 million fund, with $10 million invested in each company over the course of its life and a desired return of $300 million. To be fair, let’s also assume the VC jumped in on the A round, followed up on B and has 25 percent ownership at the end, with non-participating liquidation preferences.
Let’s look at a few different outcomes of our 10 startups after 10 years.
They all do “average” and exit at $50 million
Green marks the exit size; purple the payout amount of the VC with his 25 percent.

Ten companies, they all exit at $50 million. The VC would return $12.5 million on each. Outcome: 10 * $12.5 million = $125 million. We needed $300 million, right? Not good. Let’s give them better odds.
Half do average like before, and half do better

Five sold at $50 million, so $12.5 million return on each. The other five did much better and pulled off $100 million exits. The founders are overnight millionaires and their picture is in the paper. The VC? Not so much. Return: (5 * $12.5 million) + (5 * $25 million) = $187.5 million return. Still not quite at $300 million. No good.
Majority do “average;” we’ll throw in an overachiever

So here let’s take our previous example, but make one of them a star. The 10th company, instead of selling for $100 million as before, now does $500 million. So our original five still sell at $50 million, four sell at $100 million and our new one at $500 million. Total returns for our VC: (5 * $12.5 million) + (4 * $25 million) + (1 * $125 million) = $287.5 million. We’re almost there! Just a bit more.
I think you see where this is going… we need one big fat unicorn exit!

We would need one large exit to see good profits. Something like this would work: nine startups sell for $50 million each and one goes for $1 billion: (9 * $12.5 million) + (1 * $250 million) = $362.5 million. We finally made it! Everyone is happy.
But is the last scenario actually feasible? Can you realistically expect all 10 companies to exit? Indeed, a 100% success rate sounds too good to be true. The more realistic scenario is that out of those 10, five will be complete losers, three will sell for small-medium amounts (which we just saw barely move the needle) but one or two will be big unicorn hugging exits ($1 billion-plus)
The realistic case

Five startups fail and do $0, three exit at $25 million, one exits at $200 million and our superstar does $1 billion. Let’s see the return on that one:
Return: (5 * $0) + (3 * $6 million) + (1 * $50 million) + (1 * $250 million) = $318 million
We’ve finally made it. Phew that was hard. Here we see some good returns, but is it actually realistic to think that the average fund can find this golden unicorn ticket? Probably not. The apparent truth is that most VCs aren’t doing as well as our “realistic case.” Only the good ones. Only the top 5 percent (not the top quartile!). And if the fund size is bigger, like the $1 billion funds we see being raised, then the math only gets harder, and the likelihood of a 3x+ return gets even lower.
But VCs always seem successful, right?
Yes and no. How are the rest of the 95 percent of VCs making ends meet? Not on their investing prowess, but rather on the fees that their investors pay. Most VCs are well (and primarily) compensated from the 2 percent annual fees on committed capital that they charge their investors ($100 million fund => $2 million/per year fees).
 Even when they don’t generate great returns — and most don’t — their personal compensation is guaranteed from the fee stream. If that’s not enough, remember this: If one of their startups does see a liquidation event, they get 20 percent of the profits as a bonus. They’re sharing the upside, without any risk if things go south. As an entrepreneur, I wish I had that downside protection!
There’s still hope
It’s still hard for me to accept the fact that the only realistic way for a fund to get acceptable returns is to try to find only the companies that could be the next Ubers, Facebooks and Airbnbs. Under these rules, it doesn’t make sense for VCs to invest in anyone that can’t get to unicorn stage. There’s just no place for “average” companies looking to be worth and sell less than $500 million. At least not with VCs.
The way the numbers are worked out, it doesn’t look promising for any startup founder with less than shooting-to-the-moon goals. Even less so as a VC who’s fighting to keep his head above water and secure a follow-up fund. And don’t get me started on the LPs, who are the real losers here. They are the ones paying the fees, taking on the risk and then realizing disappointing returns at the end of the 10-year fund (which actually takes 15 years to liquidate).
But does it have to be like this? One place we can try to play around is our assumptions tab. Assumptions can and should be challenged:




10-year fund? Why not six? Reducing the fund length from 10 to six years decreases the expected return from the whopping 3x to a much more sustainable 2x. Much less pressure for a VC to return $200 million rather than 300. How can it be done in less time? One-two years for scouting and finding 10 A-round startups, four-five years for growth. Add some non-stop pressure on the founders to sell all the way around. The counter argument is that VCs are powerless to control exits — the founders run the show when it comes to exits (see Uber, Airbnb, etc.) — so gaining liquidity faster is unlikely.  


Screw traditional investors, move to the “cloud.” We should be able to find better access to capital that isn’t looking for 12 percent returns. Can’t we find investors willing to get an 8 percent stable yield in a $1 billion-plus fund diversified over hundreds of startups? Moving from 12 percent to 8 percent reduces the required return by a third. More lenient investment legislation (Jobs Act) is breeding more P2P and crowdfunding venture arms. Together with the 8 percent yield, you’ll find much more non-traditional investors joining the game. The counter-argument here could be you can find similar returns just by dumping some cash in the stock market and waiting it out. But then again, stocks don’t have the same “disruption excitement” as startups do.

Invest in more startups/less cash in each. The assumption today is that VCs want to own 20-25 percent equity of any startup in which they invest, assuming they have cash to follow up. The reasoning being, if there actually is a realization event (exit/IPO), they want to score big. Instead of investing $10 million in each 10 startups, let’s try a more seed-level by investing $1 million in each of 50 startups. We’ll also throw a follow-up series A $3 million round for one-third of those, closing the $100 million round and giving the investor 10 percent equity in average. If half of those series A end up selling each for $100 million, we would see a return of (8 x $100 million x 0.15 percent = 120 million).

Level the playing field. VCs and LPs aren’t aligned. The current industry standard for VC compensation is “2 percent and 20 percent.” Meaning VCs get paid 2 percent of the fund size in management fees (salaries) and an extra 20 percent of any liquidation event that might happen. So VCs get paid even when they “fail” to return adequate returns. LPs only get paid when VCs do an amazing job (rare). The end result is that both parties have separate agendas that don’t necessarily overlap. The ancient “2 percent and 20 percent” should be killed off and replaced with something that endorses higher alignment. Let the VCs fight for their supper.


Only the strong survive. This may be hard for many VCs to read, but many of you out there should be killed off. Low-performing funds shouldn’t be able to raise additional rounds. This burden is on the shoulders of the LPs. They should take a cold hard look at the performance of their funds. Instead of looking just on the return rate (IRR), public market equivalent (PME) should be used to see how they performed compared with the market. For example, if a fund returned 13 percent IRR in 2014, but the public market actually did 14 percent, is that a sign of high performance? Nope. LPs need to smarten up and stop reinvesting in additional rounds seeing actual returns.




To summarize, venture capital is a tough business. LPs struggle to get paid in excess returns for the risk, fees and illiquidity they take on for investing in venture capital. Entrepreneurs struggle to scale and grow their companies and position for great exits. It’s not natural for a founder at stage one to know how he’ll grow from zero to billion. So many things will change along the journey. VCs struggle to generate the returns they promise, and only a very few manage to deliver.
But VCs enjoy the only downside protection in the business — they can rely on fees to pay themselves when their investments are mediocre. The long feedback cycle means that VCs can raise a few funds — and lock in a few fee streams — before their less than stellar returns catch up with them.
LPs and entrepreneurs don’t have that safety net. We live and die on our investment returns. We are the real risk takers in this business, not VCs.
Food for thought.

Voice-controlled technology like Amazon Echo, Siri or hands-free features in Google Maps are things we’re starting to take for granted. But as Mary Meeker’s 2017 Internet Trends Report noted, voice controls are changing computer-human interfaces, and industries, broadly. Speech recognition or voice controls are being added to medical devices and business applications, even vehicles and industrial robotics.
But there’s a problem — voice systems have been built for standard speech today. That leaves out millions of people who live with speech impairments, or who just have a strong accent. Now, a Tel Aviv-based startup called Voiceitt has raised $2 million in seed funding to translate into clear words speech that’s not easily intelligible.
The startup, which was co-founded by CEO Danny Weissberg and CTO Stas Tiomkin, is a graduate of the DreamIt Health accelerator. Investors in Voiceitt’s seed round include Amit Technion, Dreamit Ventures, Quake Capital, Buffalo Angels, 1,000 Angels and other angels.
Here’s how Voiceitt works: Users fire up the company’s app and it asks them to compose then read short, useful sentences out loud, like “I’m thirsty,” or “Turn off the lights.” The software records and begins to learn the speaker’s particular pronunciation. A caregiver can type phrases into the app if the user is not able to do so independently.
After a brief training period, the Voiceitt app can turn the user’s statements into normalized speech, which it outputs in the form of audio or text messages, instantly. Voice-controlled apps and devices can easily understand the newly generated audio or written messages. But Voiceitt also can be used to help people with speech impediments communicate face to face with other people.
A woman with a speech impairment uses Voiceitt to “translate” her words into a clear message.
Dreamit’s Karen Griffith Gryga said investors view Voiceitt as a technology that’s starting with “the thin edge of the wedge,” in the market for assistive tech. But it could be expanded to help people with strong accents use whatever voice-enabled technology Seattle or Silicon Valley comes up with next.
Weissberg explained that he came up with the idea for Voiceitt after his grandmother suffered from speech impairments following a stroke. The CEO said, “I realized how we take for granted the way we communicate by speaking. Losing this is really terrible, one of the hardest aspects of stroke recovery. So I didn’t say, right away, let’s start a company. But I began to talk with speech therapists and occupational therapists, and to learn everything I can about the problem and whether there was a market in need, there.”
An early version of Voiceitt will be available next year, but the app is in beta tests now. The company’s pilot customers are hospitals and schools, and people there who have speech differences because of a health condition, like those with cerebral palsy, Down syndrome, Parkinson’s or who are recovering from a traumatic brain injury or stroke.
Long-term, Weissberg said, “This could really be an accessibility extension to speech recognition for anyone, Google, Amazon, Apple, IBM or Microsoft. We’d love to function like a major OEM and work with all the major platforms.”

Back in January we heard about Draper’s efforts to outfit a living dragonfly with a sort of solar-powered mind control backpack. This project, known as DragonflEye, is cruising right along, and the R&D firm just released a video of the modified insect taking flight.
The idea is to control a living insect’s flight remotely, but without clumsily activating its wings artificially (the subtlety of those movements are beyond us) or merely giving the insect the idea of going in a certain direction (it can learn to ignore these notions).
To do so, the Draper team relied on what’s called optogenetics, infusing certain parts of the insect’s anatomy with light-sensitive materials that both produce and respond to light in a certain wavelength (more details in my original article). It’s not a simple undertaking, as the project’s senior researcher, Joe Register, explained in an email to TechCrunch.
“Last year we focused on developing core enabling technologies like the backpack, optrode, and synthetic biology toolkit for the dragonfly,” Register said. “Now that we are in our second year, we have equipped dragonflies with our first-generation backpacks in a motion capture room that can monitor their precise flight movements as data is captured from navigation system. This has allowed us to develop precise onboard tracking algorithms for autonomous navigation.”
In other words, they’ve gone from making DragonflEye possible to making it practical. Manual control of a tiny, fast-moving bug is impractical, so setting waypoints or areas of activity seems the more logical course.

In the video above, you don’t see the fly doing much but get a second or two of airtime. Don’t worry, that’s on purpose — this generation of the hardware is pretty basic.
“Steering the DragonflEye was not the goal of this video, but we plan to do it soon,” wrote Register. “We will apply optical stimulation from the backpack to trigger flight behaviors which will allow us to develop autonomous flight control.”
Expect a lighter, more effective mind control backpack to emerge from Draper’s labs soon.

Update: Today’s launch was scrubbed due to bad weather. They’ll try again on Saturday, June 3 at 5:07 PM EDT.
SpaceX is going to attempt to reuse one of its Dragon capsules for the first time in an active mission to resupply the International Space Station. The Dragon spacecraft was used first back in September 2014 to resupply the ISS during CRS-4, and will carry nearly 6,000 pounds of supplies and research materials to support experiments during Thursday’s CRS-11 launch, the window for which opens at 5:55 PM EDT (2:55 PDT).
This is an instant launch window, so if conditions aren’t favorable or the launch is aborted for any other reason, a backup attempt will take place on Saturday, June 3 at 5:07 PM EDT. The launch is happening at LC-39A, the facility at Kennedy Space Center that SpaceX leased from NASA and reconfigured for Falcon 9 and future Falcon Heavy launches.
SpaceX will also be attempting to recover the first stage of Falcon 9 at its LZ-1 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Base. The Dragon capsule will attempt to connect with the ISS on June 4, and it’ll remain attached for about one month before it returns to earth with a planned splashdown in the Pacific Ocean.
The live feed for the launch will start around 20 minutes prior to the window, which means around 5:35 PM EDT or 2:35 PM PDT. It should prove another historic SpaceX mission, and could help SpaceX get one step closer to its goal of even more sustainable, affordable launch capabilities.

Blue Apron, which delivers ingredients to cook meals in your home and was among the companies whispered to go public this year, has now filed to go public.
Amidst an array of enterprise companies that have jumped on the IPO bandwagon following Snap’s successful IPO (aside from its more recent whiff of an earnings report), Blue Apron appears to be the next major consumer IPO. That’s important, because it continues the tone that both enterprise and consumer companies see an opportunity to go public, which may signal additional activity as we go further into the year.
There’s one unique twist to this consumer IPO, however: it was actually profitable in the first quarter last year. Blue Apron said it brought in $3 million in profit in the first quarter last year, though it swung to a wildly larger loss in the first quarter this year. While younger companies are expected to burn a ton of money (especially Snap, the largest consumer IPO in many years), Blue Apron appears to have been able to control its costs for at least a hot second before going into growth mode.
The company is showing a rather incredible amount of growth. Blue Apron said it generated nearly $800 million in revenue in 2016, up from $341 million in 2015. For the first quarter this year, Blue Apron said it generated $245 million in revenue, up from $172 million in the first quarter last year. Despite all this, Blue Apron said it lost $55 million in 2016, though it said it lost $52 million in the first quarter this year.
Getting into the unit economics, Blue Apron said it had 4.3 million orders in the first quarter this year, up from 3.7 million orders in the fourth quarter of 2016. That number of orders seems to be steadily increasing, with the company logging 2.9 million orders in the first quarter of 2016. Its average revenue per customer in the first quarter this year was $236, down from $265 in the first quarter last year.
The company said the average order value in the first quarter this year was $57.23, which was a decline from the first quarter last year when it said the average order was $59.28. That might not come as a huge surprise as the company looks to continue to grow its customer base, which means it has to appeal to consumers that might be more price sensitive — even if it’s bringing them in at a trickle. It also has to improve its logistics and operations, which can drive the cost of those orders down.
As Blue Apron’s competition heats up, its marketing costs are also going to balloon. This quarter, the company said it spent $61 million on marketing, up from $25.4 million in the first quarter last year. Last year it spent $144.1 million in marketing, up from $51.4 million in 2015.
But that, too, shouldn’t come as a big surprise: As Blue Apron looks to expand beyond its metropolitan home bases like major cities, it’s going to have to make a much broader push for awareness among the more typical consumer. Not surprisingly, a lot of this spend is coming in the form of offline media.

As a food-driven business, however, Blue Apron faces some interesting challenges that it’s laid out in its risk factors. Here’s one of the ones that stands out: food safety and food-borne illnesses.

“Unexpected side effects, illness, injury or death related to allergens, food-borne illnesses or other food safety incidents (including food tampering or contamination) caused by products we sell, or involving suppliers that supply us with ingredients and other products, could result in the discontinuance of sales of these products or our relationships with such suppliers, or otherwise result in increased operating costs or harm to our reputation,” The company said in its filing. “Shipment of adulterated products, even if inadvertent, can result in criminal or civil liability.”
Blue Apron also says that variability in food costs — and generally changes in the macroeconomic environment and consumer spending — can also have a big impact on its business. That’s not too surprising as Blue Apron, which is often seen as a tech company, has to deal with a complex chain of logistics and moving parts that sources supplies from many different locations and businesses. Blue Apron has to not only build out the sourcing network, but the technology to ensure that everything runs smoothly (and doesn’t break).

Really, this whole section on risk factors for the IPO — laid out for potential investors and often quite boilerplate — has a lot of details that you won’t often find in the typical consumer IPO. Here are a few of the other interesting risk factors:

“Any failure to adequately store, maintain and deliver quality perishable foods could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.”
Our business depends on a strong and trusted brand, and any failure to maintain, protect or enhance our brand, including as a result of events outside our control, could materially adversely affect our business.
“The reliable and cost-effective storage, transport and delivery of ingredients and other products and our product offerings is critical to our business, and any interruptions, delays or failures could materially adversely affect our reputation, business, financial condition and operating results.”


Unsurprisingly, Blue Apron looks to target a younger audience. Users between the ages of 25 and 44 years old make up more than half of the company’s business, which might not seem too surprising for observers of the meal kit market (and, in general, on-demand food industry). The company says it’s delivered 159 million meals nationwide.

The IPO also looks like another big win for Bessemer Venture Partners, which owns nearly 24 percent of the company. First Round capital also owns around 10 percent of the company. Blue Apron has raised nearly $200 million in financing, with its most recent cash influx coming in 2015. That round was led by Fidelity, which owns 6.2 percent of Blue Apron.
As time goes on, we’ll get a better sense of how much money Blue Apron will be raising — and also how valuable the company thinks it is as it gets closer to pricing its IPO. Now that it’s filed, we should expect Blue Apron to make its debut in the coming months, which will give us a sniff test on the whole meal kit market (and potentially on-demand meals as a whole).

Yext’s first earnings report as a publicly traded company seems to be a boringly pleasant one — but that’s a good thing for a company that needs to show strong performance out of the gate.
These early reports can be critical for setting the stage and expectations for a company going forward. Snap, for example, whiffed on its first earnings and promptly saw its stock tank, and Twilio’s last report did not fare that well either. While Snap opened the floodgates for IPOs this year, an enterprise company like Yext had to show the kind of predictable growth and performance that might be expected from similar companies like Box (which also had a boringly pleasant earnings report this quarter).
Now on to the boring bits, which sent the stock up 1 percent in extended trading: Yext said it generated $37.1 million in revenue, up 37 percent from the same quarter last year. It also reported a loss of 13 cents per share. Wall Street expected a loss of 15 cents per share on revenue of $35.4 million. For a young company, it may seem like a nominal amount of revenue, but it has to show it can continue to grow a business built on the backs of a user behavior that companies have to chase — getting the information they need from a variety of different sources on the internet.
The company’s software helps companies make sure their basic information — like addresses — are the same and accurate across the variety of apps and sites that people use every day. If you’re looking for a location of a restaurant, you probably aren’t going to the company’s website. Instead, users are likely searching on Google Maps or other apps, which gives these companies an incentive to pay for Yext to make sure all that works smoothly.
Yext took clear advantage of the IPO window being open, with the stock popping nearly 21 percent on its first day of trading. After pricing the IPO at $11, Yext is now hovering at around $14.75 per share — putting its market capitalization over $1.2 billion. Yext was one of a large batch of companies that went public earlier this year, starting with Snap, and nearly all of them have at least appeared to have successful openings.

Joining an overwhelming chorus that includes most Americans, several major businesses in the U.S. and much of the global community, several investors have come out swinging against President Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Paris Climate Accord.
“I have always believed that, while we can disagree on the scientific premise behind climate change, we should all agree that advanced energy technologies represent one of the biggest economic opportunities,” said General Catalyst managing director Hemant Taneja. “To give that up is a threat to American prosperity… Our American companies will be at a huge competitive disadvantage globally if they don’t have a market to rely on in their backyard.”
That sentiment from Taneja, whose firm manages more than $3 billion, was echoed by other investors across Silicon Valley.
“Trump’s decision to pull out of the Paris Climate Accord is just the latest in an unrelenting series of disastrous policies. Though at this point, the entrepreneurs who I know have shaken off the sense of despair that hung on them in the first months after the election, and are in final-level-boss fight mode,” said Steve Vassallo, a general partner with Foundation Capital (an investment firm with $2.4 billion under management). “Withdrawing the U.S. from the Paris agreement is only going to galvanize cleantech entrepreneurs to work three times as hard to address the dangers of climate change and this presidency.”
A survey from last November by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs indicated that 71 percent of Americans supported the treaty, which created targets for curbing carbon emissions in an effort to reduce their effect on the world’s climate.
“Climate change is real.  Burying one’s head in the sand doesn’t change the science,” said Ira Ehrenpreis, a managing partner and co-founder of the Double Bottom Line Venture Partners. “Ironically, this foolish decision is galvanizing a movement from the rest of world and a grassroots groundswell of people who recognize the importance and urgency to act now.  It is truly tragic that the U.S. has abandoned its leadership and moral authority on one of the critical issues of our time.”
Over the last few days major corporations from almost every industry have made a concerted effort to convince the president to remain in the treaty.
Salesforce’s Marc Benioff even tweeted an (almost literal) midnight appeal to send a signal to President Trump.


Dear President Trump, as some of the largest companies in the US, we strongly urge you to keep the US in the Paris Agreement. pic.twitter.com/ztSXyYtRrm
— Marc Benioff (@Benioff) June 1, 2017



Speaking yesterday from Recode’s conference in California, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton (and President Trump’s former adversary for the presidency) said that a decision to leave the agreement would hurt U.S. businesses.
Not all investors took a position on the decision. GV (the former Google Ventures) declined to comment on the president’s decision and the National Venture Capital Association said that the organization had no position on the president’s action.
Apparently undeterred by the will of the majority of Americans or the wishes of big business (and his own secretary of state), the president is announcing that he will withdraw from the Paris Climate Accord.
“In order to fulfill my solemn duty to protect America and its citizens the United States will withdraw from the Paris Climate Accord,” the president said from a podium at the Rose Garden of the White House.
The next step for the president and his cabinet is to “begin negotiations that will allow America to re-enter” the Paris Accords under terms that the president deems more fair to U.S. interests.
Also as part of the withdrawal from the agreement, the president committed to withdraw from the $100 billion Green Climate Fund. The U.S. has already provided $1 billion to the fund.
“Exiting the Paris Agreements protects the United States from future intrusions on United States sovereignty,” the president said.
Now what?
So what does all of this mean?
Honestly, not much for businesses. It reinforces the president’s signals that he will privilege fossil fuels like coal and oil over renewable resources. And despite those signals, the move toward renewables will likely persist.
As The Wall Street Journal notes:

The Trump administration’s withdrawal from the Paris Agreement heralds a decisive change in U.S. climate policy, but many corporate leaders say it will have little immediate impact on their investments and strategies.
The reasons are diverse. Companies are responding to customer and shareholder demands to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions. Many large companies operate in states and countries that are implementing climate rules and thus face pressures beyond the U.S. government.
Firms are buying natural gas and renewable electricity that emits less because it is becoming cheaper. And many are making long-term capital investments that will reduce their carbon footprints with an eye toward future decades, not the current election cycle.

Indeed, while investors decried the decision, they admitted that their companies were already prepared for it.
“Most of the folks working around energy and climate no longer seem to require policy support,” said Shaun Abrahamson, a managing partner at Urban Us. “But more than that there seem to be enough businesses and consumers who are committed to climate action. Many of them opposed Trump, so in some ways, supporting startups in these areas will be another form of resistance.”
Ultimately the only consequence of the move is optical and political.
Given the terms of the agreement, the U.S. wouldn’t actually withdraw from the accord until November 2020 (indeed, the first day the U.S. would be free of the accord would be one day after the presidential election).
What the president has done is put a pin in an eventual talking point for the 2020 election and cede any U.S. involvement in global negotiations on climate going forward.
Already the European Union has responded by beginning to embrace China’s overtures toward global treaties and taking a leadership role.
The president closed his speech with an appeal to his base.
“I was elected by voters of Pittsburgh, not Paris. I promised I would exit or renegotiate any deal which fails to serve U.S. interests,” the president said.
And the mayor of Pittsburgh has a response.


As the Mayor of Pittsburgh, I can assure you that we will follow the guidelines of the Paris Agreement for our people, our economy & future. https://t.co/3znXGTcd8C

There is no such thing as too many rainbows. For LGBTQ Pride Month, Instagram is rolling out a special set of pride-flavored features, including a sticker set (Instagram has stickers now, you’ve probably noticed) and a rainbow brush. The sticker set includes a swoopy-banged person holding a rainbow aloft, a cute trans flag/heart situation and a rainbow megaphone for when you need to metaphorically shout assorted gay things from within your Instagram story.

Once you post a sticker to your story, it becomes clickable with a pop-up link to the #pride2017 Instagram hashtag and a little shout-out to the creator. In this instance, all of the creators are LGBTQ artists, which thank goodness. The rainbow brush button now lives next to the regular drawing tools and, predictably, it creates rainbows. Did I mention you can never have too many rainbows?
Instagram is also launching an international mural project where it will transform walls around the world into selfie-friendly rainbow art projects, starting with the Paul Smith wall in Los Angeles.





 In honor of Pride month, @instagram painted the famous @paulsmithwall on Melrose 🌈✨ Stop by the geotag above and celebrate equality and love #kindcomments
A post shared by Gray Malin (@graymalin) on May 31, 2017 at 5:27pm PDT


This is the part for the necessary disclaimer about how topical product features don’t always mean that a company (or its parent company) does the work to pursue the deeper parts of an LGBTQ-inclusive agenda, a message worth remembering as we sail swiftly into the ever-corporate seas of Pride Month. Still, rainbows are definitely better than no rainbows and visibility remains an important piece of the progress puzzle.

Elon Musk is making good on his promise to leave President Trump’s White House advisory councils, he said today on Twitter. The Tesla and SpaceX CEO promised Wednesday he would step down from his official advisory roles with the administration should Trump go through with his plan to leave the Paris Climate Accord. Trump announced the U.S. would be removing itself form the agreement on Thursday.


Am departing presidential councils. Climate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world.
— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 1, 2017



Musk cited climate change and the downsides of leaving the Paris agreement both for the world and for the U.S. as his reasoning. The prolific tech entrepreneur said previously that he has attempted to convince the President to support of the Paris agreement, through his council involvement and through White House connections.
Prior to this decision, Musk served on Trump’s economic advisory board, as well as his manufacturing jobs initiative council. He’s received criticism from supporters for his close relationship with the administration in the past, particularly in the face of Trump’s executive order on immigration from Muslim-majority countries, and subsequent doubling down on that position by the White House.
Musk held fast even following Uber CEO Travis Kalanick’s departure from Trump’s economic advisory council, when Kalanick left following the issuance of the immigration order. Musk noted then that he believed “engaging on critical issues [would] on balance serve the greater good” as his reasoning for sticking with the council at the time.
Update —  The departures continue. Disney CEO Bob Iger is resigning from the president’s council as well, calling it a “matter of principle”:


As a matter of principle, I've resigned from the President's Council over the  #ParisAgreement withdrawal.

Intel CEO Brian Krzanich was interviewed at Code Conference on Thursday, where he talked about his long-term vision for automobiles. He said his prediction that “the car of the future is going to look much more like a server” was a driving factor in their recent acquisition of Mobileye, the Israeli auto startup for which Intel paid more than $15 billion. 
Krzanich said that someday “if you get a ransomware or some kind of virus on one portion of the device,” Intel will not only have backups, but they could “refresh your car on the fly.” While he acknowledged that there are some potential privacy concerns, Krzanich believes that connected cars will be “much safer.”
“In order for those cars to drive, they do have to look,” said Krzanich about self-driving cars. “There’s a lot of social good that can come out of this.”
He hoped that automotive technology will someday help with situations like Amber Alerts, where they could locate the whereabouts of missing children. “We’re really trying to understand how data will be adjusted and how can you apply artificial intelligence,” he said.
Shortly after his presentation, Intel released its findings that autonomous driving will result in a $7 trillion boon to the economy by 2050. Their reasoning is that “autonomous driving and smart city technologies will enable the new passenger economy, gradually reconfiguring entire industries and inventing new ones thanks to the time and the cognitive surplus it will unlock.”
These predictions were similar to Marc Andreessen’s, who proclaimed at Code Conference that self-driving cars would result in the creation of suburbs further away from cities, because the commutes will be more tolerable. Building these cities would create a lot of jobs, he surmised.

Google still has plans to introduce built-in advertising filters for its Chrome web browser, according to a new report from the Wall Street Journal, but it’s going to be more of a quality assurance feature, akin to existing tools in Chrome that prevent pop-ups from spawning in excess, and that warn users when they might be exposed to content that could harm their devices.
The report says that Google is also reaching out to publisher partners to provide clear guidelines about what these new quality filters will entail, and will also eventually offer a tool publishers can use themselves to flag ads that currently exist on their sites that will run afoul of the new blocker. This is designed to give publishers at least half a year to prepare and prune their advertising prior to its debut in a consumer build of the browser, which is planned for sometime next year.
These plans could still change, the WSJ report notes, but for now the standards for what kinds of ads Google will deem blockable by the filter include those categories covered under the Coalition for Better Ads, an industry organization (which includes Google among its membership) that released a list of offensive ads in March. Google’s tool is also said to block all ads on sites that cross a certain level of unacceptable advertising content, according to these standards.
Meanwhile, the search giant is also said to be offering up a new tool referred to as “Funding Choices” which will allow publishers to display messages asking visitors to disable their own third-party ad blockers or pay up for a pass to go ad-free, should they opt to use it.
Google was said to be working on this feature back in April. The company’s decision to roll this into its own browser is likely motivated, at least in part, by a desire to put control over ad-blocking tech into its own hands, since much of that now resides by third parties, including some that collect fees from Google in exchange for whitelisting its own advertising content.
Years ago I called for a black and white computer, and that strange desire still lives within me today. While no one has yet taken me up on this amazing idea, the monochrome devices that do exist have improved, yet are still frustratingly limited in their capabilities. That’s why the reMarkable tablet is such a pleasure to me. They went full e-paper.
If you’ve been following it since the announcement late last year, you’ll know the reMarkable is a sort of Kindle on steroids, a digital notebook that’s made to imitate as closely as possible the experience of writing on paper — but with all the advantages of modern tech.
Now, I didn’t get a hands-on with a prototype the way several other outlets did (a hazard of working in the remote Pacific Northwest), so I’ll be waiting for the final device before I render a final opinion on whether the reMarkable accomplishes what it sets out to do. But I want to put down for the record that I’m rooting for them.
I talked with co-founders Magnus Wanberg and Mats Solberg, CEO and chief design officer, respectively. They seemed a lot like myself: nostalgic for the undeniable qualities of paper, excited about the prospects of e-paper devices and disappointed with existing options.
“In our opinion as really hardcore paper people, none of them really work,” Wanberg said. “It’s not the same experience, not for writing, not for reading, not for sketching.”
Over the last couple of years they worked to augment the capabilities of e-paper displays, tweaking this and that, improving software and trying different interaction methods. All this, it must be said, while tablet and Kindle sales weren’t making any headlines. I admire the determination to move forward with a project even though it isn’t part of some accelerating trend.
The lower the latency between touch and response, the more natural writing would feel. Ultimately they were able to nearly halve the latency of the latest e-paper displays, down to about 55 milliseconds — the iPad’s pen latency, for the record, is 50 ms (Update: With the latest updates, Apple claims to have lowered latency to an impressive 20 ms).
That’s a major accomplishment, and one that impressed E Ink enough that the two companies began working together. And the other aspects of the tablet — its Wacom-like passive pen with tilt and pressure support, its layer support for documents (critical), its thoughtful material choice — are also welcome.
But the technical achievement is secondary, I think, to the vision of a useful product that doesn’t fit within any existing popular buckets.
The reMarkable is built from the ground up to be black and white, to handle and share documents and sketches and to be a comfortable, paper-like environment lacking the cumbrousness of Windows or the constant pushes from Amazon to buy more everything. It’s made to do several specific things well, and within the limitations of a monochrome touch display.
“We wanted the product to represent the sort of… limitlessness of paper,” said Solberg. “There’s no branding, no bells and whistles or LCDs.”
It isn’t a Kindle on steroids, and it isn’t a hipster iPad. It’s very much its own thing, and that’s not common with new devices.
The specifics of the device, how it handles and whether it’s as useful as I think it will be — those can wait until this summer, when I should have a full review of final hardware before the reMarkable ships. For now, you can learn more at the reMarkable site or pre-order one for $479.
Payments startup Stripe is always on the lookout for ways it can help its users make better use of its APIs, and occasionally builds new products to solve common problems they face. A good example of that is Sigma, a new data analytics tool the company is rolling out today.
Sigma is a fully customizable SQL tool that will be available as part of all Stripe accounts. The idea behind it is to eliminate the need for Stripe customers to build their own data analytics tooling. That would usually mean building a data pipeline and data warehouse where users would pull information from Stripe before analyzing it.
Instead, Sigma makes data analytics available directly in the Stripe dashboard. Companies running Stripe will have access to real-time information with no setup work or ongoing maintenance necessary. It allows anyone in a business (with permission) to now be able to write simple queries that will give them deeper insights into their business.
Queries can be written in SQL, and shared or saved by users, allowing them to track how different metrics change over time. Sigma provides a series of templates that will allow businesses to easily figure out which customers might have unpaid invoices this month, what their recurring revenue is in a certain time period or what their average revenue per user might be.
“Because Sigma is a query editor, you can express any question or query or analysis of your business data,” Stripe co-founder Patrick Collison told me in a phone interview this week. “It has immense flexibility built right into it. Rather than providing specific reports or pre-packaged data, we’re creating maximally flexible tools.”
Collison likened the development of Sigma to its launch of Radar, a fraud prevention machine learning tool that Stripe launched last fall. In both cases, Stripe is tackling a common problem many of its users face, while taking advantage of the resources and data it has internally.
“We’re always looking at common challenges our users are facing,” Collison said. “With Sigma, we heard from a lot of businesses that they had various analytics needs. We wanted to eliminate as much duplicative work across the platform and give them a flexible query interface. We believe all of these different needs and different use cases can be solved across a common set of tools.”
The company is launching Sigma today at Stripe Sessions, its first-ever conference for hundreds of Stripe users. Collison said it wasn’t exactly Dreamforce, but Sessions would be an opportunity to get some of its large and diverse user base together and get feedback from them.
“Stripe has always been very developer-driven and we’ve done very little in terms of informing people what we’re doing instead of just publishing things on our website,” he said. “We’re trying to evolve how we engage with our users… and we hope this will be a valuable way for them to learn more about Stripe.”
Facebook shareholders have once again rejected a proposal for Facebook to prepare a gender pay equity report to assess pay between men and women across race and ethnicity. A stockholder proposal called for Facebook to prepare a report by December 2017 around the company’s policies and goals to reduce the gender pay gap. Shareholders rejected a similar proposal last year.
Facebook, whose board of directors recommended a vote against the proposal, argued that it has already been reviewing compensation fairness to ensure pay equity for years. This past April, for example, Facebook VP of People Lori Goler highlighted Facebook’s internal processes to ensure there is equal pay at the company.
“Given our ongoing compensation practices and diversity efforts, and that we have previously shared that we have pay parity, our board of directors believes that the preparation of the report contemplated by this proposal is unnecessary and not beneficial to our stockholder,” Facebook wrote in its opposing statement.
However, as noted on Facebook’s annual shareholder call today by Natasha Lamb, managing partner at Arjuna Capital, a 2014 Glassdoor study found that female software engineers at Facebook make $5,949 less than their male counterparts.
Lamb went on to say that Facebook is put at a competitive disadvantage by not showing leadership in this area, noting how tech companies like Intel and Apple have conducted in-depth reports to assess pay equity.
The tech industry’s gender gap is close to the U.S. average (5.4 percent), and falls in the middle among industries, according to a 2016 Glassdoor study.  Meanwhile, Google is currently battling it out with the Department of Labor over allegations of pay disparities between men and women.

Ford’s mobility play isn’t just about new modes of using cars – GoBike, its bike sharing program, is also part of that same vision. The GoBike program is set to launch in earnest across the San Francisco Bay Area by the end of June, the company announced today, and will be available to all residents using either physical Bay Area transit Clipper cards or the Ford GoBike app.
The launch is an expansion of the Bay Area Bike Share pilot program that’s currently available in a much more limited capacity, and will see the available pool of rental bikes increase 10x from 700 to 7,000 total available bicycles, to be rolled out between now and the end of next year across 546 stations spanning San Francisco, Oakland, San Jose, Berkeley and Emeryville. The existing pilot will end on June 11 and service will be suspended until the grand re-launch, but current members will automatically be extended to make up for the gap.
Those who aren’t yet members but who are enticed by the idea will be able to get “Founding Memberships” ahead of the launch; this is capped to the first 1,000 members, but includes a $124 total yearly cost, which is a $25 discount on a normally priced yearly membership, and a unique Ford GoBike-branded Clipper card which will doubtless become a top collectible in time.
Ford’s partnering with Motivate on its bike share program, and the latter is the one with all the bike share expertise, since it’s a bike share service provider and operator which helps run NYC’s Citi Bike, D.C.’s Capital Bikeshare and more.
Ford first revealed its intent to back the growth of the Bay Area bike sharing operation last September, when it also announced its acquisition of commute-sharing startup Chariot.
E-books are a lot of things. Convenient. Good for the environment. Usually cheaper than printed books. One thing they’re rarely accused of is being good-looking. Ugly books is what 180g is declaring war on with a completely revamped, 2.0 version of Vellum. Oh, and in the process, they’re adding support for making wood-pulp books, too. Fancy.
There’s no real shortage of software that can generate e-books. Hell, if you are a particular sucker for punishment, you could probably convince Microsoft Word to gargle out something that could be turned into a giant stack of faxes, bound together and generously be called a “book.” The problem with Word and most other e-book-creation software is that they are almost universally completely hopeless. Terrible user experience, and mediocre output at best. The problem is, it’s for e-books, so nobody really cares. Except those of us who do, that is.
The software makes it easy to create box sets, too, if you’re a particularly prolific word-writer
Vellum’s previous version has been out for a few years, and there are plenty of e-books that have been created using the software already. The biggest change for today’s 2.0 launch is that the package now supports creating books for print, too, with an integration for on-demand printing services like IngramSpark and CreateSpace.
Vellum 2.0 can create print-ready files for e-books, even if you’re not a massive print nerd (like yours truly). Taking an e-book for an outing into meatspace includes knowing about margins, trim sizes, font sizes and page numbering, and creating front matter, headers and footers and page-numbered tables of contents. You also need to do typography geekery such as widow prevention (avoiding single sentences on a page) and spread balancing. Sounds dirty, no? I like it. Either way, Vellum takes care of all of that, plus converting images to print-ready black and white. Best of all, you can proof it all using any PDF reader — such as the Preview app.
The company’s pricing scheme is interesting, with two tiers available: a $200 tier for e-books only, or a $250 tier for both electron-powered books and books: Deforestation Edition. If you want to upgrade from one tier to another, you’ll be charged $100, so it may be worth doing a bit of planning ahead. Once you have a license you can make as many books with as many pen names for as long as you like.
Vellum is only available for Mac, with no plans in the pipeline for other platforms. A bit of a setback if you’re a Windows or Linux jockey, but for the Mac fans among us, you’re golden.
As you can tell, I’m a wee bit excited about Vellum. Why? Well, if you’ve ever had the displeasure of putting an e-book together, you’ll have experienced the excruciating pain of making sense of any of this — it’s a huge pain in the rectum, finally resolved by an elegant piece of software that takes most of the hassle out of the process.
Adobe today is launching a new mobile app that makes it easier to convert paper documents and other things into digital, editable PDF files. While there’s no shortage of scan-to-PDF apps on the App Store, many are not free, have a dated design, or simply convert an image to PDF format, but don’t allow for edits. Adobe Scan, meanwhile, uses optical character recognition (OCR) to convert the printed text to digital text that can then be searched, selected, copied or annotated in Acrobat Reader DC or Acrobat DC.
In addition, Adobe says the free app doesn’t limit you on the number of pages you can scan nor does it downgrade the quality.
Of course, another advantage – or disadvantage, depending on your viewpoint – to using Adobe’s app over scanners from, say, Microsoft (Office Lens), Google (Google Drive), or a popular third-party app, like Scanner Pro, is that it’s designed to work with Adobe’s Document Cloud. For Adobe’s customers this is a plus, though others may prefer the flexibility of more agnostic solutions that let you pick and choose your preferred upload destinations.
The documents you scan in on mobile will be automatically uploaded to your Adobe Document Cloud account, where you can store them online, share with others. But if you’re an Acrobat DC subscriber ($12.99/mo Standard, $14.99/mo Pro), you’ll also be able to fully edit and organize documents, collect signatures, and more.

Adobe Scan doesn’t just work with standard paper files, it’s worth noting. The company says you can also scan things like shopping receipts, business cards, a slide shown during a meeting, and even whiteboards.
The new app is powered by Adobe Sensei, the company’s A.I. and machine learning-based platform. Sensai is used for things like boundary detection, auto-crop and capture, perspective correction, and auto-clean to remove shadows, for example.
It also works with the new mobile functionality in Adobe Sign, for automatically signing and sending documents from any device, says Adobe.
The new app is available today for both iOS and Android devices.
Twitter might consider adding premium subscription features to TweetDeck, but likely won’t charge all users because the reduced access wouldn’t jibe with what Twitter wants to be, according to COO Anthony Noto. Today at Code Conference, Noto explained the four characteristics that make Twitter special, and how those guide its product evolution.
“As growth slowed in 2015 we had to come to grips with what Twitter was,” Noto told Recode’s Peter Kafka. The conclusion was, “Twitter is the best at showing what’s happening in the world.” Here’s how Noto says it does that:


Fast – Tweets are instantly publicly available and widely distributed through its apps, embeds and integrations with TV shows.

Comprehensive – No matter what you want to hear about, Noto says Twitter has a strong selection of content about every topic.

Discussion – People respond to tweets, create a richer and more engaging experience.

Personalization – Because Twitter knows who you follow and what tweets you interact with, it can show you the most relevant content.

Noto didn’t spell out why charging a subscription fee to everyone would conflict with these traits, but here’s what’s implied:


Fewer Tweeters – Twitter breaks news first because anyone who sees or learns something important can instantly share it. Charging would deter or disenfranchise some people from tweeting, so news and commentary would slow down because it would have to wait until it was spotted by someone who pays.

Thinner Coverage – Twitter has eyes and ears all over the world because it’s free. But even a relatively low price like $5 per month would be prohibitively expensive for some people, especially those in the developing world. Charging would thereby weight Twitter toward the opinions and perspectives of people and places rich enough to pay.

Restricted Conversation – It’s the people with the most marginalized perspectives that can sometimes add the most to a conversation, and often they’re not in the position to pay. Charging would certainly deter spammers and trolls, but also sacrifice the long-tail of contributors.

Reduced Choice – If everyone can’t use Twitter freely, people can’t as accurately depict their interests through their following graph. Users could only follow and interact with content from those willing to pay, making personalization less robust.

On the other hand, charging for premium TweetDeck features could be seen as a way to help journalists and power users react more quickly to Twitter content, follow a wider range of topics efficiently, contribute to more discussions nimbly and interact with more content to produce data for personalization.
To end the panel, Noto answered The Verge editor Casey Newton’s question about whether he supports adding the ability to edit tweets by throwing it back whether it meshes with the four principles.
While Twitter might be reluctant to do anything that interferes with these core tenets of its product, its Q1 2017 revenue fell 8 percent year-over-year to $595 million, so it needs to find some way to turn its blue birds into more green.

Lyft just released its first-ever diversity report, a couple of months after Uber released its first one. Lyft, which committed to releasing a report last June, says it will continue to release reports annually.
Here are some high-level stats. Lyft is 63 percent white, 19 percent Asian, 6 percent black and 7 percent Latinx. Uber, on the other hand, is 49.8 percent white, 30.9 percent Asian, 8.8 percent black and 5.6 percent Hispanic. So, yes, Lyft is whiter than Uber, but Lyft employs more people who identify as female than Uber, with 42 percent of Lyft’s staff identifying as female. At Uber, women make up 36.1 percent of its workforce.

Lyft also breaks down its employee population by leadership and tech roles. At the leadership level, 36 percent of Lyft’s employees identify as female, 18 percent are Asian, 1 percent are black, 5 percent are Latinx and 70 percent are white.
Some data points missing from the report are stats around the employment of LGBTQ people, people with disabilities and intersectional data.
As I’ve said before, I have mixed feelings about diversity reports because the existence of them hasn’t led to any notable improvements in the tech industry. But at the end of the day, they do help hold companies accountable. So, kudos to Lyft for finally releasing one.
“Releasing our data will hold us accountable, but it’s the actions we take that will make a difference to the people who come to work every day at Lyft,” Lyft wrote on its blog. “Our diversity data exposes gaps in important areas. So we’re doing something about it.”
Lyft noted how it hired Tariq Meyers, who formerly worked as a community affairs organizer at Lyft, to lead its diversity and inclusion department last year. Lyft also pointed to the fact that it’s been working with diversity consulting company Paradigm to identify additional opportunities to attract, select, develop and retain diverse employees.
Lyft’s report comes the same week Uber’s board of directors is supposed to receive Eric Holder’s report about workplace culture in light of sexual harassment allegations from Susan Fowler-Rigetti.
Walmart today says it has begun testing using store employees to make last mile deliveries for online orders in select markets. The idea is an expansion on the retailer’s recently launched 2-day shipping program, which lets customers order from over 2 million online items for fast delivery without an annual membership. The company said it realized those same trucks could just as easily bring any Walmart.com or Jet.com ship-to-home orders to its stores, then allow the local staff to drive the packages to customers’ homes.
The test started small. Launched in April, there are only two stores in New Jersey and one in northwest Arkansas that are running this program today. But Walmart is already touting how the early results are promising.
For store employees who opt to sign up to do deliveries, it’s a way to earn extra cash – often just by expanding their commute home a bit.
Walmart says the program is optional for now, though if it decided to fully launch this program in the future, it could choose implement more structure. For the time being, however, if there were not enough volunteers from store staff, Walmart would continue to use local courier services.

Today, staff use a proprietary mobile app to opt in to the program and configure things like how many packages they want to deliver, the size and weight limits they’re comfortable with, and which days they’re willing to make deliveries after work using their own vehicle. Workers also have to submit to additional background checks, motor vehicle record inspections and provide proof of insurance.
A lot of technology has gone into the development of this program, hinting that this test is being seriously considered as an alternative way to handle last-mile deliveries at scale. For example, there are routing algorithms that minimize the collective distance the employees need to travel off their commutes home to make the deliveries.
Staff can also enter in other destinations they’re heading to after work, then be shown delivery stops along those routes. The app provides navigational assistance, as well.
In addition, Walmart has done a lot of work on its backend order management system to make this delivery program viable for both Jet.com and Walmart.com online orders.

Of course, one could argue that Walmart’s penchant for not paying workers a livable wage almost necessitates the need for its staff to have a second or side job – or, as many today say, a “side hustle.” A number of lowly paid workers across the U.S. now supplement their incomes by working in the gig economy – like driving for Uber or Lyft, for example.
In Walmart’s case, workers making deliveries will be paid hourly wages during deliveries  – which might be less than on competitors’ services, or when driving Uber – but they also have the perk of being an employee, not a contractor. That means they’ll have access to the standard employee benefits that come along with their job.
Shaving the cost on last-mile deliveries by leveraging workers looking for extra income isn’t a new idea for retailers. Google Express and Amazon Prime Now use local couriers to route their deliveries, for example (and have been sued for classifying workers as independent contractors and the low wages paid). Amazon also implemented a similar last-mile program via Amazon Flex back in fall 2015, which hires locals to deliver packages via their own personal bike, car, or van.
“We don’t think about this from a gig economy standpoint,” explains Walmart spokesperson Ravi Jariwala. Plus, he adds, Walmart’s program differs from others.  “In our scenario, associates are already starting where packages are – they’re probably leaving work and going home anyway – and our routing algorithm is designed to minimize the incremental time and distance that an associate would have to spend driving to make these deliveries,” he says.
Walmart’s advantage, too, is its stores. The company has 4,700 U.S. stores with over a million associates. Its stores are within 10 miles of 90 percent of the U.S. population, which means workers who take on deliveries won’t have to drive out of their way – or, as with Amazon Flex, drive to a Amazon fulfillment center that’s often outside the town it serves. Plus, Walmart can smartly route shipments to the closest store to its customers.
In the past, Walmart tested last-mile delivery via partners, like Uber, Lyft, and Deliv. Jariwala confirms that Uber is still being tested in Phoenix, but tests with Lyft and Deliv have wrapped.

Though only live for a month, Walmart found it could manage next-day deliveries through this delivery service, it said. But the delivery process is invisible to consumers – they’re not being promised anything beyond 2-day delivery, nor do they have to make special selections at checkout, or pay additional fees.
The launch of store associate-powered delivery is one of several changes Walmart has made recently to address Amazon’s threat. This year, for instance, it lowered the prices on a million online-only items if customers choose store pickup and launched free 2-day shipping without a membership. And it has been steadily expanding its online grocery business with curbside pickup, as well.
The retailer has not said when it expands to end the current test and make the new delivery program more broadly available.
Google Sheets is getting smarter today. After adding the machine learning-powered “Explore” feature last year, which lets you ask natural language questions about your data, it’s now expanding this feature to also automatically build charts for you. This means you can now simply ask Sheets to give you a “bar chart for fidget spinner sales” and it will automatically build one for you.
All of this is backed by the same natural language understanding tech that already powered the “Explore” feature. It’s worth noting that the previous version of “Explore” could already build graphs for you, but those focused on your complete data set. It didn’t allow you to get graphs that answered specific questions.
With this new version, Google also is making it easier to keep in sync data from Sheets that you use in Docs or Slides. You could already update charts you copy into Docs and Slides with just a click, but now you also can do the same with tables.
Other new features include an improved printing experience for when you really need to see your numbers on a piece of paper — and when that paper needs to have exactly the right margins and alignment; a new chart-editing experience; a number of new statistical functions like CHISQ.INV.RT, which returns the inverse of the right-tailed probability of the chi-squared distribution (I have no idea what that means…); and support for new keyboard shortcuts.
Facebook is revamping its photo album feature with the ability to add videos, check-ins, text posts to albums, follow friends’ albums so you’re notified when they’re updated, and display “featured” albums on your profile to highlight your favorite collections. Facebook is also simplifying the ability to add contributors to a collaborative album, which was an option added in 2013 but deeply buried in the product.
The update rolls out to Android and web today, with iOS coming soon.
Create albums with more than just photos, easily allow friends to contribute, feature albums on your profile, and follow albums for notifications about new additions
Facebook described the purpose of the update to TechCrunch, writing “Gone on a surf trip recently? Share videos of you tacking your waves, your check-in at the pier, a photo of your board and more – in a single album.”
Giving albums more flexibility could help Facebook stave off the newly invigorated assault from Google Photos. Google can now store all your photos for free, detect who’s in them and suggest sharing with them, automatically share photos with your closest friends or family, and let you search your library by keyword using machine vision. Those features approximate some of what’s available in Facebook’s photo sharing app Moments.
With this update, Facebook hopes to differentiate itself by allowing you to organize more than just photos in albums, drawing on its vibrant social network that Google lacks since G+ flopped. The new feature essentially lets you create digital scrapbooks of all kinds of content. That raises the question of whether Facebook will start letting you create, print, and buy physical photo books from it the way Google does now.
Xbox Game Pass, the all-you-can game monthly subscription service for Xbox One, is now available to anyone who owns the console. The service went live for Xbox Gold members last week, but is now open for anyone who both A) has an Xbox One console and B) wants to plunk down $9.99 per month to access the library of over 100 games, including Xbox 360 and Xbox One titles.
Game Pass doesn’t stream games over your internet connection, like some of its competitors, including PlayStation Now. Instead, players can download the entire game locally to their console, so that they can play on any quality connection, or even without one at all. You also get an initial 14-day free trial so you can see if you like it enough to pay.
The library includes Halo 5: Guardians and some other recent marquee games, but a lot of its value is in rolling up a bunch of the classics you may have missed out on when they were new. You can check out what’s available even if you don’t have an Xbox One, using the Xbox app on a Windows 10 PC, to see if you might be interested enough in the offering to pick up some new hardware.
Robots are good at a few simple things. They can lift and carry huge objects, fly around like dragonflies, and murder our families while we watch, their cold circuits flitting with nascent feelings of remorse and anger. But they can’t stack rocks very well.
This is because rocks are all different. However, imagine a situation when a robotic arm needs to move rubble or build a foundation for a house. Knowing how to manage heavy boulders and tiny pebbles would be a valuable skill. Researchers at ETH Zurich have unveiled such a robot in their new project, “Autonomous Robotic Stone Stacking with Online next Best Object Target Pose Planning.”
The system is completely autonomous and the robot receives no human input to pick up and stack non-homogenous rocks.
 The project involves a robotic arm and camera system. The camera measures the rocks and estimates their weight and center of gravity while the arm gently lifts the rocks and plops them on top of each other. It’s only a matter of time before these robots abandon rocks, however, and begin stacking the skulls of their enemies.
The arm can stack up to six rocks – a challenge for humans – but it works best with four. I, for one, welcome our rock stacking robotic overlords.
One of Alexa’s more practical, everyday uses is setting timers – helpful when cooking, remembering to perform some task, or alerting kids it’s bedtime, among other things. Today, Amazon is improving its timers by allowing users to name their different ones. This will make it easier to use multiple timers simultaneously, Amazon says.
Plus, since many Alexa customers were already using the timer feature to set reminders, Amazon is now formalizing that use case by allowing you to ask Alexa to “remind me” instead of “set a timer.”
With Reminders, you can now ask Alexa to alert you to anything of your choosing – even if it’s at a later date. For example, Amazon suggests you could remind yourself to pick up the dry cleaning, or put the laundry in the dryer, pay bills, or perform some other task or chore.
You can ask to be reminded at a particular date, day of the week, or just time of day, if it’s a reminder you’re setting for the same day. These can all be viewed and managed in Alerts & Alarms section of the Alexa app.
When the reminder is due, a blue light ring appears on Amazon’s Echo connected speaker and Alexa’s voice reminds you of the task at hand.
In addition, timers can now be assigned names, which will make them easier to manage. That also means it will be easier to have multiple timers going at the same time. To name a timer, you can just ask Alexa to set a timer using the name you want, like “Alexa, set a pasta timer for…” Plus, you can cancel or check on these timers by name, as well, like “Alexa, how much time is left on the garlic bread timer?”
You can also see a list of your active timers within the Alexa app.
The news follows yesterday’s announcement of iCloud calendar support in Alexa – its first Apple integration. (Alexa already supports calendars from Google and Microsoft).
Amazon says both reminders and named timers were among the top requests from customers.
Both features are rolling out today in the U.S., and then will arrive in the U.K. and Germany in the coming weeks.
Microsoft today launched version 2.0 of what is now called the Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit. This open-source toolkit, which was previously known as CNTK, is Microsoft’s competitor to similar tools like TensorFlow, Caffe and Torch, and, while the first version was able to challenge many of its competitors in terms of speed, this second version puts an emphasis on usability (by adding support for Python and the popular Keras neural networking library, for example) and future extensibility, while still maintaining — and improving — its speed.
The toolkit originally launched into beta in October 2016 and the team has tested it ever since. Now, the company deems it to be ready for production use.
Microsoft technical fellow Xuedong Huang told me that the 1.0 release was very much about open sourcing Microsoft’s internal toolkit and making it available to others. Because it was essentially an internal tool, though, it didn’t support Python for example, even though it’s by far the most popular language among machine learning developers.

Because Microsoft originally built this toolkit for speech recognition systems, it was very good at working with time series data for building recurrent neural nets. With this update, the team has not only improved the Cognitive Toolkit’s performance for other kinds of neural nets, but also laid the groundwork for making it easier to extend the system in the long run.
That’s where Keras comes in, for example. Huang stressed that the first version of the Cognitive Toolkit outperformed its competitors pretty easily on a number of standard tests. Keras is a popular Phython-based deep-learning library that’s already supported by TensorFlow and Theano, for example. Now that the Cognitive Toolkit also supports it, thanks to its new extensible architecture, developers can not only easily take their existing Keras-based applications to the Cognitive Toolkit but also see a major speed-up. Huang argues that under the right circumstances, the Cognitive Toolkit can outperform its competitors by up to 3x.
In addition, version 2.0 also includes Java language bindings for model evaluation and a number of new tools that allow trained models to run on relatively low-powered devices, including smartphones.
The Cognitive Toolkit is used extensively within Microsoft already. Some groups inside the company also use other toolkits, though, as Huang freely admitted. “There is no one toolkit that is great at everything,” Huang said. “We want to help the AI community. We are not saying that the Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit is the solution for everything.”
Like Google, Facebook and others, Microsoft would of course love for the machine learning ecosystem to build more of its solutions around its toolkit. To do that, it needs to increase its mind share among developers, though. Unsurprisingly, Microsoft is stressing the fact that the Cognitive Toolkit is a battle-tested system that it uses to power most of its internal AI systems, including Cortana, and that it can train models faster than most of its competitors.
Looking ahead, Huang noted that it’s hard to say what features will arrive in version 3.0. “AI and deep learning is a field that moves so fast, the best thing we can do is to continuously adapt and iterate and improve,” he told me. “We are absolutely aware of the challenges to support this massive and amazing AI community.” One feature he definitely wants to keep, though, is the Cognitive Toolkit’s performance leadership.

Code rules everything around me. And you.
Really: be it the stoplight you stared at this morning, or the train you rode in on, or the lil’ robot vacuum keeping your floor ever-so-slightly cleaner while you’re away, code is everywhere.
But even for people who’ve put the time in to learn to program, jumping from software to hardware can be a challenge — even if said challenge is just figuring out where to start. How do you program something real? How do you build something that moves?
Apple is taking steps to tackle that problem by bringing third-party hardware — think robots, drones, and musical instruments — into its learn-to-code platform, Swift Playgrounds.

Unfamiliar with Swift Playground? That’s okay — it’s only about a year old. Swift Playgrounds is an iPad app that Apple built to teach people (not just kids, Apple notes whenever talking about it) to code. On one half of the screen, users write code — actual, live, Swift code (albeit code that’s generally executing on top of a more complicated engine behind the curtain) — to complete challenges. On the other half, said code runs at the tap of a button. One lesson might have you move a character around a board one step at a time to teach you how functions work; another might have you tweak the mechanics of a brick breaker game to teach you about variables.
A little over a million people have used Swift Playgrounds since launch, Apple tells me. With today’s news, Apple is working with a handful of companies to bring hardware into the mix. Folks like:

LEGO’s DIY robotics line, Mindstorms. Swift Playgrounds will work with EV3, the third generation Mindstorms line that LEGO has been selling since 2013.
Sphero’s rolling robots, including the SPRK+ developer bot and Star Wars BB8 edition (alas, no support for that oh-so-awesome animatronic Lighting McQueen RC car just yet.) One of the lessons Sphero showed off involved building a real-world, multiplayer Pong using the Sphero as the ball and your feet as the paddles.



Parrot’s Airborne, Rolling Spider, and Mambo drones. The companies showed this off with drones that were controlled by the accelerometer of an iPad running Swift Playgrounds, with the drone backflipping at the flick of the wrist
Wonder Workshop’s Dash robot — an upgradeable, sharp-cornerless bot that focuses on being accessible to kids as young as 6
The Skoog, a squishy little cube that acts as a programmable musical instrument.
UBTECH’s MeeBot kit, the goofy little dancing robot featured up top

Some of these teams had already started tapping into Swift Playgrounds on their own, with Apple having opened Playgrounds content creation to third party developers from the beginning — the aforementioned Wonder Workshop, for example, has been offering Swift Playground lessons for a few months now. Apple embracing the integrations really just formalizes thing, makes it simpler to tie third-party Bluetooth devices into Swift Playgrounds, and adds a bunch of support from Apple’s end.

This is a smart move on Apple’s part, and one that’s pretty characteristic for the company. Apple has used education as a foot-in-the-door (with varying degrees of success) for decades, from sending Apple I’s to schools in the 70s (to prove their prowess over the big ol’ mainframes of the time) to donating tens of thousands of iPads to schools just last year.
But this move potentially helps them introduce themselves to a new level of student — the budding hardware engineer — early on.
Take the LEGO Mindstorms integration, for example. Mindstorms is already used in robotics clubs around the world.
LEGO already has its own development tools for Mindstorms, including one for the iPad. But now they get a solid, ultra newbie-friendly coding platform in Swift Playgrounds. One with its own teaching platform built right in, and one where the most complicated bits of the system (the underlying engine) are largely maintained by Apple.
Apple, meanwhile, gets to pop up in those aforementioned robotics clubs (the stomping grounds of many a lifelong engineer) and say “Hey kids! Learning your first programming language to make that robot dance? Check out our programming language, Swift! Oh, and do it on an iPad!”
It all just makes sense.
These new third-party tie-ins will start working with the release of Swift Playgrounds 1.5, which Apple tells me should hit the App Store on June 5th.
It’s been a year since the four major social platform players agreed with Europe’s executive body to a voluntary Code of Conduct for removing illegal hate speech within 24 hours of a complaint being received.
A lot has happened on this front since then, with a series of content moderation scandals hitting different platforms and serving to ramp up the regional pressure on the tech giants — including YouTube suffering an advertiser backlash over ads being served up next to extremist content; and Facebook accused of a series of moderation failures, including around child abuse and terrorist content. Not to mention fake news gate.
In Germany the government is now leaning towards legislating to levy fines of up to €50 million on social media platforms if they do not remove illegal hate speech promptly — claiming tech giants have not been doing enough (a UK parliamentary committee also concluded more needs to be done last month, and has urged the government to consider introducing fines as well).
But today the European Commission, at least, is trumpeting what it dubs “significant progress” on illegal hate speech takedowns by Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Microsoft vs their performance six months prior. Though it also cautions some challenges remain.
Illegal hate speech is defined in EU law as the public incitement to violence or hatred on the basis of certain characteristics, including race, color, religion, descent and national or ethnic origin.
When the four tech firms receive a request to remove content from their online platforms they assess the request against their rules and community guidelines — but also, in Europe where applicable, against national laws on combating racism and xenophobia. So they are making judgements on whether content can be considered illegal online hate speech, and if so they have agreed to take it down — aiming to do so within 24 hours of a report being received.
The EC argues that removing illegal hate speech is not censorship but rather helps defend the right to freedom of expression because threats can prevent people from feeling able to freely express their views.
 
A majority of illegal hate speech is now being removed
The evaluation of the voluntary Code of Conduct, a year in, found that on average in a majority (59 per cent) of cases the tech platforms responded to notifications concerning illegal hate speech by removing the content — which constitutes a more than 2x rise on the removal level recorded (28 per cent) in the first evaluation of the code, six months ago.
It also found an improvement in the amount of notifications reviewed within 24 hours — up from 40 per cent to a majority (51 per cent) in the same six month period.
Although it notes that Facebook is the only company that “fully achieves the target of reviewing the majority of notifications within the day”.
Other areas for improvement the evaluation highlights are discrepancies between when a citizen reports content vs when an organization reports content.
So while it notes some progress on this front, with tech platforms apparently improving how they handle citizen complaints, it also says “some differences persist”, and that overall removal rates remain lower when a notification originates from the public.
The evaluation also points to ongoing discrepancies between tech platforms in their feedback systems for users who report content — with only Facebook sending “systematic feedback” to inform a person how their notification has been assessed.
“Practices differed considerably among the IT companies. Quality of feedback motivating the decision is an area where further progress can be made,” it adds.
The EC is drawing on an evaluation carried out in 24 Member States by NGOs and public bodies for this assessment. Whereas the German government has been basing its assessment of social giants’ performance on hate speech removals on reports from local youth protection organization, jugendschutz.net. (And in March, it used that assessment as a basis for criticizing Facebook and Twitter especially for not doing enough to promptly remove illegal hate speech — and also introduced a draft provision to legislate for fines of up to €50M.)
In this, the second evaluation of the EU Code of Conduct, 2,575 notifications were submitted to the tech firms taking part in the code — a 4x increase vs the first monitoring exercise, in December 2016. While Facebook received the largest amount of notifications (1,273 cases), followed by YouTube (658 cases) and Twitter (644 cases). Microsoft did not receive any.
Making some general observations, the evaluation said that within the last year the four platform giants have strengthened their reporting systems and made it easier to report hate speech.
They have also trained staff and — in the EC’s words — “increased their cooperation with civil society”.
The EC further suggests the Code of Conduct has helped tackle the spread of illegal hate speech in the region by strengthening and enlarging the tech firms’ network of “trusted flaggers” throughout Europe.
And it argues that via increased co-operation with civil society organizations the tech platforms have gained “a higher quality of notifications”, which in turn is yielding “more effective handling times and better results in terms of reactions to the notifications”.
Vĕra Jourová, the European Union commissioner for justice, consumers and gender equality, described the results of the one-year evaluation as “encouraging”.
“This is an important step in the right direction and shows that a self-regulatory approach can work, if all actors do their part,” she said in a statement.
“At the same time, companies carry a great responsibility and need to make further progress to deliver on all the commitments. For me, it is also important that the IT companies provide better feedback to those who notified cases of illegal hate speech content,” she added.
In another supporting statement, Andrus Ansip, the EC’s VP for the digital single market, added: “Working closely with the private sector and civil society to fight illegal hate speech brings results, and we will redouble our joint efforts.
“We are now working to ensure closer coordination between the different initiatives and forums that we have launched with online platforms. We will also bring more clarity to notice and action procedures to remove illegal content in an efficient way — while preserving freedom of speech, which is essential.”
Last month Facebook announced it would be beefing up the size of its team of content reviewers by 3,000 additional staff — bringing the total headcount to 7,500. Though it’s been dealing with a string of content moderation scandals, not just in Europe — such as its Facebook Live being used to broadcast murder and suicide.
Commenting in a statement on the Code of Conduct evaluation today, Richard Allan, VP public policy EMEA for Facebook, said: “We believe that the best solutions to the challenge of hate speech on the Internet are found when governments, civil society and industry work together.
“The results of the independent tests released by the European Commission today show that our partnership is having a significant positive impact for people in the EU. We have made many improvements to our policies and processes over the last year and now see that more illegal hate speech is being removed more quickly than ever before.
“We are determined to keep doing better and live up to the high standards that people rightly expect of us. We recently announced that we would be adding another 3,000 staff to our global team of reviewers. We are also looking at how we can use the latest technology to help our review teams identify and prioritise high risk content.”
In a statement, Karen White, Twitter’s head of public policy in Europe, added: “At Twitter, we strive to reach the right balance between showing all sides of what’s happening and tackling hateful conduct. Over the past six months, we’ve introduced a host of new tools and features to improve Twitter for everyone. We’ve also improved the in-app reporting process for our users and we continue to review and iterate on our policies and their enforcement. Our work will never be ‘done’.
“As the world’s conversation evolves, so too does the challenge we face. We will continue to operate at pace, while meeting our core principles around freedom of expression, and defending and respecting the voices of those who use our service worldwide.”
Twitter is also stepping up its efforts to inform users of existing tools they can use to manage which content they do and don’t see on its platform (or “manage your experience” as it puts it) — and is currently sending the below email notification to users in Europe to flag up what it describes as “three key tools for staying safe” — namely:

Mute
Rather than see content in Tweets you’d like to avoid, you can manage what you see in your timeline and notifications. Mute accounts, words, and conversations.
 
Notification Filters
Get an extra level of control by filtering the types of accounts you see in your notifications. You can choose to stop seeing notifications from certain kinds of accounts.
 
Block
You can instantly block any account. When you do, that account holder can’t see your Tweets or send you a message while they’re logged in.

UPDATED: Attack of the drones
The Age of Resilience – Security in 2017



As content delivery networks (CDN) market leaders like Akamai and Cloudflare grapple with technological shifts, some innovators like Teridion, Signal Sciences and Section.io (in which I am an investor) are making rapid advances.
The CDN market, estimated at $5 billion today, is anticipated to be more than $10 billion by 2019. While the market is growing rapidly, can the giants learn to dance? How are the startups aiming slingshots at the legacy Goliaths? Newcomers like StackPath aim to win by offering a “security first” CDN, which, in the wake of the #CloudBleed can be a marketing differentiator. Above all, how will that elephant in the room — Amazon CloudFront — trample all the unicorns?
Looking back: A brief history of CDNs
The first wave of CDNs started with Akamai almost two decades ago in 1998. CDNs were designed to accelerate web content. In the world of constrained bandwidth, speed of delivery is affected by a variety of factors, including page content and effective routing of traffic. Web companies that experience heavy web traffic needed a reliable, rapid mechanism to ensure uninterrupted service. Akamai promised all that, and then some.
Within a year of its launch, Akamai went IPO and had Apple Computer as its logo customer. At the time, Apple constituted 45 percent of its total $1.2 million revenues. Limelight Networks was a fast-follower to Akamai and was launched in 2001. It went public in 2007 but has not been able to catch up with Akamai. In 2016, Akamai posted $2.3 billion in revenues with a market cap of more than $10 billion. (Limelight Networks posted $170 million revenues in 2016 with a market cap of $290 million. Private equity shops, take note.)
Over time, websites became more dynamic and bloated, and we entered the SaaS / application era. And then, the shifts of cloud and mobility changed the way content was delivered and consumed. CDNs started to mitigate DDOS attacks. Add the growing demand for security to that mix and slowly but surely, the CDN universe is getting disrupted.
Amazon launched its own CDN, CloudFront, in 2008. Cloudflare started circa 2009 offering content delivery, security and analytics. In 2011, Fastly got launched and recently announced a new $50 million funding round. StackPath raised $180 million in a single round to disrupt CDN markets. Its CEO, Lance Crosby, is a badass who started SoftLayer and sold it to IBM for $2 billion. Having that kind of an exit made it easier for Lance to raise a war chest of $180 million.

These newcomers have created headaches for Akamai, eating into its margins, steadily forcing the price down. Akamai’s Media Delivery Solutions revenue for 2016 was down 9 percent year-over-year. As CDNs supply-demand curve shifts, customers are enjoying price drops of 20-40 percent.
Grappling with changes
As we enter the new applications- / DevOps-driven world, the developers will drive the next-gen CDN consumption. Dynamic microservices, Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) and, of course, performance and security remains paramount.
Let’s look at some of the technological shifts:
Bloated web pages: We are fat, getting fatter. Average bytes per web page has grown ~3X to 2.4 MB in the past five years, as reported by httparchive.org.
An Akamai study shows web page load times for desktops have increased by 63.8 percent in two years, from 7.2 seconds (2013) to 11.8 seconds (2015). And when it comes to dynamic content, customized to enhance the user experience, all bets are off. Steven Sinofsky, the former president of the Windows division of Microsoft, tweeted recently about LinkedIn slow load time as his “favorite new feature.”

The growth of video: As the CDNs attempt to deliver bloated pages, the type of content has shifted. The demand for video / live streaming / dynamic application content continues to grow. Video is expected to grow 4X by 2020, when Cisco predicts 82 percent of all IP traffic will be video. Video consumption during busy-hour internet traffic (7pm-11pm) is expected to grow nearly fivefold from 2015 to 2020. Dynamic content and bandwidth peaks is the new CDN game, away from static cached content.
Mobile consumption increases: By 2020, ~30 percent of traffic is expected to come from smartphones. The average load time for mobile sites is much more worse — 19 seconds over 3G connections. In a September 2016, “The Need for Mobile Speed” study, Google found that 53 percent of mobile site visits are abandoned if pages take longer than three seconds to load. The data, based on analysis of more than 10,000 mobile Web domains, suggested that mobile sites load in five seconds earn up to two times more mobile ad revenue than those whose sites load in 19 seconds.
So publishers are motivated to drive for speed. And we all know that a one-second delay in Amazon’s web page load time could burn $1.6 billion in sales. Accelerating content for mobile is a headache for CDNs.
Not too far away in the future are gaming, VR/AR and IoT companies. The times they are a changing — and getting messier. Such technological changes are forcing CDNs to improve speed, while dealing with dynamic content.
Optimizing traffic routes over diverse network pathways (ISP, 3G, mobile), balancing load / peak demand and ensuring security is now expected of CDNs. While legacy CDNs are slow to react, several upstarts are tackling traffic optimization, next-gen WAF and DevOps-friendly CDNs.
Optimization of routing: The routing of internet traffic is determined by an archaic Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), which does not factor in timing for data routing. It only looks at the number of hops between two networks. But what if the route with the least number of hops is congested? Or the protocol picks a physically longer route?
For example, a packet may traverse from San Francisco to Los Angeles via Brazil. What if there was a route with multiple hops but was much faster? BGP works really well in terms of reliability. It is a fundamental technology on which the internet is built, but BGP is sub-optimal from a latency (delays, jitter and image freezing) standpoint.

Teridion acts like the “Waze of internet traffic” and optimizes traffic routes using third-party cloud. Its platform helps make real-time packet routing decisions to avoid congested paths. Unlike CDNs, its solution scales on demand and is not limited by upstream communication, pre-provisioned PoPs, geography or cloud providers. It is therefore much quicker to provision. As there is no caching of data, SSL certificate management, security and compliance issues are non-existent. It extends to each and every end-user of a cloud-delivered service.
Chris Keene, chief executive of Teridion says, “As you add more options for acceleration, each has its own security implications and possible trade-offs. Some companies do not want to share SSL Certificates and give up the keys to their kingdom. CDNs cannot do much for such companies.”
Egnyte, an Enterprise File Sync and Sharing (EFSS) upstart, beat some of the giants of file share companies such as Box, Citrix, Google and Microsoft. It was faster by 30 percent in speed over Box and as much as 60 percent for larger 4GB files.
Egnyte was ranked one of the top vendors achieving high marks in an IDC study of sync performance of file share and storage vendors. Kris Lahiri, co-founder of Egnyte says, “The IDC speed test looked at the time to ‘synchronize’ content between the local client and the cloud. This is bidirectional, so any changes made on endpoints needed to be synchronized ASAP. We used a robust web socket connection, smart clients and Teridion’s network acceleration. All these different optimizations got reflected in the results observed by IDC.”
Instead of the conventional CDN path, Egnyte created its own PoPs and partnered with Teridion to optimize the route dynamically in a continuously optimized fashion. In such a scenario, no SSL off-loading was required and that reduced the potential attack surface. ​
Peter Christy of 451 Research pointed out that Teridion is clever non-obvious technology, and for any CDN it would take time and effort to replicate it. “Even then, it will likely be inferior initially. And then time and effort will be required to operate, maintain and improve such an offering.” While optimized routing is one of the CDN areas of innovation, security is another hot area.
Content + security = better CDN
CDNs moved into security by offering DDoS protection. A site could be taken down with a flood of requests. With a CDN fronting the traffic, the netflow traffic patterns can be analyzed and scrubbed inline. In recent times, CDNs have started to push into offering Web Application Firewalls (WAF) and bot mitigation. Enterprise customers now look to CDNs to manage web security. Akamai’s Cloud Security Solutions 2016 revenue was up 43 percent year-over-year.
While CDNs aim for improved security, CDNs themselves can be vulnerable. In his blog post, David Hobbs writes about several CDN security challenges that include dynamic content attacks, SSL-based attacks and direct IP attacks. The recent Cloudbleed incident shows that infrastructure complexity has its trade-offs. Peter Christy of 451 Research says, “Cloudbleed was frightening because it leaked private information for some Cloudflare customers. I’m sure most people didn’t think it even possible.”
Cloudbleed and the recent AWS S3 problems were both good ole “bugs” — longstanding interactions between complex systems that often go unnoticed. Cloudbleed and Heartbleed (a 2014 bug) were examples where customer data that should have been shielded got leaked.

In another study, 16 CDNs failed in a simulated forwarding loop attack. Here, a malicious customer of any CDN can create forwarding loops inside CDNs. Forwarding loops can cause CDNs to process one client request repetitively, effectively launching a DoS attacks against CDNs.
So far, DDoS attacks against web sites was well-known, but this was the first time when a DoS attack can be launched against a CDN itself by one of its customers. It’s often easy to sign up for a CDN and get a free account. Launching a forward loop attack is not too difficult.
Andrew Petersen, CEO of Signal Sciences, is building the next-generation Web Access Firewall (WAF) that combines security with usability for the DevOps world. Having faced these challenges in his previous life at Etsy, Andrew and his team have taken a bottoms-up approach.
“CDNs can’t get deployed on internal apps. As multiple security tools have to be used it gets harder to manage quickly. If we take a step back, CDNs’ primary focus is speed. Philosophically and technically, this creates trade-offs with performance” Petersen says.
In his blog post, Zane Lackey, co-founder of Signal Sciences, identified six appsec challenges that CDNs may struggle to solve. The development environment is unlikely to have the same configuration as production due to cost and architecture restrictions.
As these environments don’t match, a CDN-based WAF will often trigger false positives in production that are completely unreproducible in development. Debugging failures at this level is frustrating, because access to the CDN console is restricted to the operations team. In practice, a CDN-based WAF is not very friendly to those pursuing DevOps.
From centralized to dispersed: The cloud becomes the edge
Ernie Regalado, editor-in-chief of market research publication Bizety, says, “Edge security as a business model has taken off and it is the fastest growing segment in the industry. Companies like Cloudflare, Incapsula and Distil Networks are pushing to offer DDoS Mitigation, WAF and Bot Mitigation.” Window Snyder, chief security officer at Fastly, echoes the sentiment, “We see data / traffic patterns, understand vulnerabilities and can enhance edge security to further protect our customers in specific ways.”
In this classic innovator’s dilemma, the newcomers are able to start with a clean slate, while incumbents work from their position of strength. Fastly recently announced a $50 million funding round claiming a $100 million annual run rate. Yet Fastly could become slowly if another “edge CDN” StackPath continues down its war path. With 45 PoPs in 25 cities, StackPath has grown rapidly via five acquisitions, including MaxCDN and Highwinds, offering integrated acceleration and security.

James Leaverton, VP Ecosystem Development, StackPath, says, “Legacy CDNs are not ready for the shifts to online video and IoT. They have Frankenstein platforms — a user might have to log into a dozen different portals. They have aging infrastructures that were optimized for CDN, but not built to adapt or scale. That’s why companies like ours exist. The StackPath platform is an integrated response to a fragmented problem created by too many delivery and security solutions.”
The DevOps-friendly CDN
As developers become the prime focus for some startups, a DevOps-friendly CDN based in Colorado, Section.io, is slowly but surely establishing its roots. (Disclosure: I am an investor in Section.io via Secure Octane seed fund.)
Backed by Techstars Ventures, Section.io CEO Stewart McGrath wanted to build a platform for developers. Dev teams need new control tools and flexibility in staging and testing their content. “They really have no idea how the site will run until they get into production. And then you need the visibility / metrics once you are in production,“ says Stewart.
To manage traffic, CDNs use different types of reverse proxies such as squid cache, Nginx or Varnish Cache. In a containerized environment, you could have multiple reverse proxies to choose from. In his blog post titled CDNs are dying, Stewart argues that engineers should not feel locked into any one proxy software stack at any one time. Rather, they should be able to pick and choose the tools that work best for their website.
The multi-tenancy also allows isolation, reducing risk of contamination. Section.io aims to decouple proxy software from the networks and takes a software-driven approach to configuration, management and deployment of reverse proxies. “We believe this is the future of a web application delivery platform. Developers can have full control over reverse proxy configuration and experiment in a testing environment,” says Stewart.

The ease of installation, testing, performance and troubleshooting changes how developers can manage their processes from end to end. For legacy CDNs, this will be a challenge in the long run.
As technology needs evolve, innovators are often able offer better solutions and expand certain markets. Ernie Regalado of Bizety writes that the CDN market is likely to be much larger, especially as hungry CDNs invade other’s tech sectors seeking new revenue streams. He expects the overall market to grow to $12 billion by 2019.
This is driven by a convergence (or a collision) between several markets, such as CDNs, multiprotocol label switching (MPLS), Software Defined Wide Area Networks (SD-WAN) market and the Cloud Radio Access Network (RAN) market. Companies like Cato Networks, Aryaka and Versa Networks have raised significant rounds of capital and are making strides in these segments.
Betting on the winners
On one end, web companies like Facebook, Netflix, Pandora and even Apple have shifted to managing their own content delivery. Legacy CDNs are left with no choice but to evolve. Should the giant Akamai worry about the cold CloudFront blowing in from Seattle? According to Datanyze research on CDN markets, AWS CloudFront is eating its way up from the bottom of the market and leads in the Alexa top 1 million domains, while Akamai is strong in the top 100 domains.

Meanwhile, Amazon has steadily crept up and added AWS WAF in 2015 and AWS Shield (DDoS mitigation) in 2016. How this battle plays out remains to be seen. Ernie Regalado says, “AWS is the dominant provider of centralized cloud compute services. Akamai is the leader in edge services, including delivery, security and streaming. As processing, data and business logic move to the edge, Akamai has the advantage and can even disrupt AWS.”
Cloudflare, StackPath and Fastly have raised enough capital. Who gets acquired or goes public remains to be seen. My hunch is Lance will aim for an IPO for StackPath — it’s unlikely he will be content with anything less, especially knowing his last exit was a $2 billion outcome. That could create some heartburn for Cloudflare and Fastly. The young Turks like Distil Networks, Section.io, Teridion and Signal Sciences could raise mucho dinero and become standalone companies.
Telecom carriers and service providers will likely make some moves as networks converge with “software-driven everything.” Those in the enviable nimbler / innovators category will win, no matter which way the wind blows.

High Times, the most prestigious brand in pot, has been valued at $70 million in a deal that sees it selling a 60% majority stake for roughly $42 million to investment firm Oreva Capital. Originally a marijuana enthusiasts magazine founded in 1974, High Times has blossomed into a set up web properties and the Cannabis Cup marijuana contest event series.
With wide scale marijuana legalization looming, Oreva tells me it saw High Times as ill-equipped to roll up the massive opportunities for expansion. “I wouldn’t say the current company was sleeping at the wheel, but they haven’t optimized” says Oreva Capital founder Adam Levin. The media and event business will now be known as the High Times Holding Company (HTHC) — a crafty play on the psychoactive compound in marijuana known as THC.

While upstart marijuana media and ecommerce companies like WeedMaps and Leafly are earning up to $60 per user per year, Levin says High Times earns just $0.17 per visitor. Levin sees ways to close the gap by bringing some basic best practices to a company that had only had two previous owners, both affiliated with the founder Tom Forcade’s family.
Yet as the longest-running and most recognizable brand in pot, rivaled only perhaps by Snoop Dogg himself, High Times online sees a flood of 20 million unique visitors per month beyond its 236,000 print subscribers. “There wasn’t a Pepsi to its Coke” Levin laughs.”
The best chance for High Times to fire up some more revenue could be expanding the Cannabis Cup to more states as legalization rolls across the US. Designed as a trade expo for local pot dispensaries and quality contest for growers, there are already 58 Cannabis Cup events each year which account for 75% of High Times’ revenue between ticket sales and sponsorships. TechCrunch itself has seen how parleying a media business into a contest and expo event series like Disrupt can be incredibly lucrative.

New management will be baked in beside the whole existing High Team staff, including a new head of entertainment and VP of biz dev. TechCrunch has obtained a memo sent by Levin to the High Times team, embedded below.
With marijuana going mainstream, we’re amidst “the green rush”. This proliferation of pot companies, from delivery services to consumer brands to point-of-sale business software, are seeking to capitalize on end of a prohibition era. And when new smokers come looking for which dispensary to buy from or weed tourism trips to take, a trusted media property like High Times could grow its role of defining what’s dank.

Microsoft today is launching a completely revamped version of its Skype application, with a new set of features that draw obvious inspiration from messaging rivals, like Messenger and Snapchat. Yes, that means Skype now has its own Stories-like feature, which it’s calling Highlights, as well as a redesign that puts the camera only a swipe away from your chats, among other things.
The company says Skype’s makeover has been in the works for well over a year, and represents the biggest change to the platform since the introduction of video sharing back in 2006. In other words, it’s not necessarily a fast-follow cloning attempt built in response to the Snapchat threat, )and Facebook’s copying of Snapchat across its platforms), but rather something Skype has been working on for a longer period of time.

“If social networks have given you the stage on which to perform your life, the new Skype gives you the additional equivalent of the local coffeehouse or corner pub, where you meet people on a daily basis to deepen your relationships,” explains Amritansh Raghav, Corporate Vice President of Skype, about the new design’s focus on enhancing users’ real social connections. “We call that set of interactions your personal network,” he says.
The idea with the revamp is to make Skype a better tool for the sort of communication and sharing that takes place among members of Skype’s more closely connected network, which often includes family and friends. That means Skype is tacking on ephemeral sharing as part of its feature set, along with Stories, and other camera-first inspired features.
It’s also today rolling out its own set of bots and chat add-ins to rival Facebook Messenger.

Highlights – Skype’s take on Stories
In the new version of Skype’s app, you can just swipe to pull up the camera – a now familiar interaction, thanks to the camera-first design found in today’s social apps.
You can then snap a photo or video – which you can then of course decorate with typed or handwritten text, as well as with Skype’s own set of stickers – very much like on other apps.
In the new version of Skype, your snapped photos and videos can be shared with individuals, in group chats, or can be posted to a new feature called Highlights.
The camera is available when you swipe right from the main screen, while Highlights are found when swipe left.

Highlights are Skype’s own take on Stories – something the company readily admits.
“It’s like Facebook has said,” says Raghav, referencing remarks made by Facebook’s VP of messaging David Marcus, who recently argued that Stories “is definitely a format, the same way the feed is a format.”
Raghav agrees. The feed is now commonly used in a range of apps – even those that aren’t personal social networks, like Microsoft’s business communications service Yammer.
“There’s a new medium that has risen,” he says of Stories. “When you think about this new way of interacting, [we want that to be] available also in this application.”

However, Skype has tweaked the Stories format a bit.
For starters, its Highlights are available for a week, not a day. (Though you can view your own content for 24 months, if you choose). Highlights are also not broadcast to your entire Skype network. Instead, they use a Twitter-like following/followers model – meaning only those who follow your Highlights can see these posts.
However, you can choose to “share” your Highlights with individual contacts or groups you manually select – a move which nudges the recipients to follow your Highlights if they don’t already, but doesn’t allow you to spam them with updates.
Followers can also react to Highlights posts, as they can to any Skype post, with an emoji. Here, Skype has copied from Facebook’s reactions – you can thumbs up (like), heart (favorite), or post emoji faces for reactions like sad, surprised, laughing, and angry. You can also type a response that’s then shared privately in a chat.

 
Bots & Add-ins
The other major feature rolling out today is an expanded selection of Skype’s bots and add-ins. Microsoft envisions how you’ll be able to chat directly with its virtual assistant Cortana, or its newer assistant Scoop, which pulls in news from MSN.com.
When a bot gets integrated in a chat, it’s called an add-in. That means you can call on the bot directly from your chat, like “Scoop, what’s up with X?” (where X is a current news item you want to know about).

In chats, Cortana will be able to make suggestions, including quick responses like “LOL” or “can’t wait,” or others related to your conversations. Scoop, meanwhile, offers a one-on-one chat with personalized news story suggestions and summaries, but can also live in a group chat to share stories relevant to that group’s conversations.
Microsoft’s demo showed a number bots and add-ins, like Cortana, Scoop, Gfycat, Giphy, MSN Weather, Search (Bing), Polls, Expedia, Stubhub, BigOven (cooking), YouTube, and Upworthy, to name a few. However, Cortana will not launch until June in the U.S.
Group Chats and more
Though Highlights and add-ins are the standout new features, there’s a lot that’s different in the revamped Skype.
For example, you can now personalize the app’s theme by picking your favorite colors, react to anything in a chat with an emoticon, or even react using emoticons in video calls – a move that will temporarily overlay a big emoticon and colored background in your window for other callers to see.
You can also now type a message when on video calls which is shown in much the same way – something that could be helpful for when you’re on a group call, but don’t want to talk.

Video chats are also going to be upgraded in the future to support other types of interactions, including the ability to play games with friends or watch videos from streaming services together. Co-watching in groups is an area where a number of social apps are trying to gain traction – including Cabana from Tumblr, Uptime from YouTube, Fam, and others.
YouTube will be among the first services added for co-watching, we’re told, but Skype is having discussions with other streaming services about integrations. Meanwhile, gaming will initially leverage existing Microsoft assets like Minecraft, Solitaire, Mah Jongg and others.
The new Skype is available on Android today, and will hit iOS in a month’s time. (The delay is due to iOS’s inability to support staged rollouts, we understand.)
Desktop platforms, including Windows, Mac, Linux, and web, will get the new features this summer, along with Xbox.

Plenty dismissed modularity (the concept of making a phone’s innards swappable and upgradeable) the first time around. And for good reason. Like just about every other gimmick in smartphoneland, the idea has been tried and abandoned more times than anyone cares to mention. With the announcement of the second generation Moto Z, however, the Motorola is not only committed to the idea of modular smartphones – it’s making the line its flagship.
It’s a pretty gutsy stance from the company. The idea of the first one was laughed off by some on arrival, but Motorola changed minds with what turned out to be a really good phone, Mods or no. I reviewed it a while back, and I liked it. A lot more than I thought I would.
The device’s hardware was solid and the execution was there. The super-thin phone, coupled with the magnetic backing that powered the devices. If there was any major downside on that first generation Z, it was the lack of Mods at launch. The promise was there, but the execution was limited. But after LG’s badly fumbled execution with the G5, the phone was breath of fresh air.
The company added a few more in the intervening months and announced plans to release an average four a quarter this year – a commitment it tells me it plans to keep. It’s also opened up prototypes to third-parties and had a handful of hackathons across the globe in hopes of getting developers more interested in creating for the platform. Here’s one with a breathalyzer and a baby monitor.

The Moto Z2 Play ups the ante, but only slightly. In addition to a better looking, cloth-covered version of the SoundBoost kickstand speaker, the phone will be launching alongside a fast charging battery pack , shells with wireless charging built-in and a GamePad.
All were present at a briefing I attended, but I can’t show you a picture of the GamePad, since it wasn’t a final version. And, of course, the mods and phones are backward compatible, so users can mix and match with last year’s hardware.
By way of explanation, the old Ion iCade controller should give you a pretty good idea of what Motorola’s working on. The case positions gaming controls on either side of the screen, making for a really, really long phone. Not groundbreaking and honestly, pretty clunky, but a nice addition to the overall ecosystem. Still, the company is going to need at least double its current Mod offering to make the system a success.
That said, Motorola apparently hasn’t had a problem moving product. The company doesn’t break out phone sales for the Z, but it says it’s sold “millions” of the device – admittedly broad, but definitely a victory for a device that really could have feasibly tanked the company’s ambitions a la the G5. And apparently high enough to warrant making this second generation product the centerpiece of its handset line.

And with this week’s Essential announcement, Andy Rubin simultaneously complimented and threw some serious shade at the Moto Z system. The Android father complimented the company’s embrace of modularity, while calling its execution flawed, pointing to its full-back system, which limits the product’s form factor moving forward. Even still, a slight vindication for the mainstreaming of modular phones.
Sales of the Mods, meanwhile, aren’t quite as impressive. Motorola’s internal research says that Mods are, no surprise, the primary driving factor in purchasing the product — but users who buy Mods are picking up between one and two per device. A Moto rep tells me that it’s closer to two than one… but when swappable backs are the device’s whole raison d’etre, that’s not exactly selling like hot cakes.
The middling numbers are probably due in part to the fact that Mod selection was pretty limited. Launching a modular phone without sufficient modules is a bit like launching a video game system with little in the way of titles – it’s an easy way to shoot yourself in the foot right out of the gate. And while speakers and battery packs are great, what functionality does the Moto Z offer that you can’t already get from basically every phone?
But the Mod selection will continue to grow – I saw a compelling one at the event that I’m not supposed to talk about yet – and the company says there are plenty more on the way, including some from winners of the hackathons, which the company will help developers make real.

As for the phone’s hardware (which is admittedly somewhat secondary), the phone’s specs are okay. But keep in mind, with the first gen, the Play was the low-end device, so you can probably expect a higher end flagship to be added to the second generation line soon. The company ditched the touch buttons, instead sticking all of that functionality into the elongated fingerprint reader, to save some space up front, so you can, say, swipe left to go back.
As reported previously, the headphone jack is back on the Play – that’s in part due to the company’s attempt to broaden the Z line to more users. Ditching the jack is a good way to alienate potential customers who don’t have the funds to switch all of their accessories to Bluetooth. Though the company tells me that it still sees the wired headphone getting phased out – though perhaps not as quickly as others had initially thought.
But can Motorola build upon the momentum of the Z with this second generation? The novelty of the first batch has worn off a bit, and while the company is committed to the project as its flagship line, it still has a ways to go as far churning out mods at a pace that will really drive consumption.
For now, in spite of that early success, the Z line still feels like a gamble. That goes double for parent company Lenovo, which has been struggling in the PC department. The Moto reps I spoke with told me to expect modularity on even more of its devices moving forward. If that’s the case, it’s time to really start hauling ass on developing those mods.
The rigorous new Chinese cybersecurity laws we wrote about last November took effect today.
They’re designed to give China’s central government more direct control over the operations of internet-based companies operating in the country.
As we wrote last November:

The regulation would require instant messaging services and other internet companies to require users to register with their real names and personal information, and to censor content that is “prohibited.” Real name policies restrict anonymity and can encourage self-censorship for online communication.
The law also includes a requirement for data localization, which would force “critical information infrastructure operators” to store data within China’s borders. According to Human Rights Watch, an advocacy organization that is opposing the legislation, the law does not include a clear definition of infrastructure operators, and many businesses could be lumped into the definition.

The official word from Beijing’s state news agency, Xinhua, is that the law is an attempt to battle increasing threats from cyberterrorism and hacking.
But it will also have a chilling effect on foreign businesses looking to grab a foothold in the world’s most populous country.
Foreign companies have argued for more clarity and more time to implement the controls that the government wants put in place, but so far China’s internet regulator, The Cyberspace Administration of China, has only relented on pushing back the date for laws relating to the cross-border flow of information.
According to a report in The New York Times, those rules won’t be implemented until 2018.
China does have legitimate security concerns. Thanks to lax intellectual property laws and rampant software piracy, the country was especially vulnerable to the WannaCry attacks from earlier in the month.
The South China Morning Post reported that more than 30,000 institutions, including some major universities, had systems that were infected with the malware.
But critics of the legislation say that it does far more than secure the internet — it wraps China’s already firmly held internet even more tightly in the government’s embrace.
As we wrote back in November:

According to Human Rights Watch, an advocacy organization that is opposing the legislation, the law does not include a clear definition of infrastructure operators, and many businesses could be lumped into the definition.
“The law will effectively put China’s Internet companies, and hundreds of millions of Internet users, under greater state control,” said Sophie Richardson, Human Rights Watch’s China director. HRW maintains that, while many of the regulations are not new, most were informal or only laid out in low-level law — and implementing the measures on a broader level will lead to stricter enforcement.

Media streaming app Plex has been around (and great) since before set-top streaming boxes were even properly a thing, but on Thursday it added Live TV integration and DVR capabilities, which make it even more useful. Nvidia is doing everything it can to make its Shield streaming Android TV box the best Plex partner around, too, and a new version of the Shield software adds support not only for Live TV and DVR, but also for writing to network attached storage and for both recording and watching recorded and Live TV right from the same place.
The Shield was “born to run Plex,” according to a quite from Plex cited by Nvidia in a release announcing the news, and it’s definitely true that the Android TV interface and Shield’s support for acting not only as a client, but also as Media Server for your stored content is a step above competing apps on devices like Apple TV and Roku.
With the Live TV upgrade, if you have a USB tuner like the WinTV USB tuner form Hauppauge, you can now grab over-the-air TV signals and and record up to two shows at once directly to your Shield, a NAS or any hardwired hard drives and USB sticks, with the only limits on storage being the constraints of your available storage space. Those stored shows can then be served up to your other devices with Plex client apps, including iOS and Android smartphones, and any PC with a web browser.
There are other solutions out there for live TV on settop devices, too, but this sounds like one of the best and easiest to set up and use, and Shield is hoping to entice more new device owners to give it a shot with a free six month Plex Pass subscription included with new Shield TV device purchases. Plex Pass, the paid subscription plan for Plex, is required to use the new DVR and over-the-air TV features. Plus, with Shield you also get Android TV in the mix, along with 4K output for available content.
Both Plex and Shield are things I honestly like and use all the time, so it’s great to see them working together on something like this. If you want an all-in-one settop box solution for a post-cable household, the Shield really is the best option out there right now and this only makes that more true.
Plex is doubling down on its support for capturing over-the-air signals from digital antennas this morning, with the announcement that it will now not only let users record TV programs, it will also allow them to watch live TV. The result is a low-cost, do-it-yourself version of a live TV streaming service – a popular new category in the streaming market, which offers a pay-TV live experience over the internet.
To be clear, Plex only offers channels that you can get over the air – that means, broadcast stations like ABC, NBC, CBS, FOX, PBS, CW, Univision, etc.
The company, whose background is in organizing users’ personal media collections, expanded to go after the cord cutter market last fall with the introduction of DVR capabilities for recording over-the-air TV.
At the time, however, Plex required users to buy a digital antenna and an HDHomeRun digital tuner. 
Today, with the added support for live TV, Plex is also expanding its lineup of supported vendors for digital tuners beyond the HDHomeRun. Users can now take advantage of USB tuners from Hauppauge and Avermedia, for example, among several other brands. (A full list of supported tuners will be posted here.)
As for the live TV interface itself, you’re able to filter the available programming by channel, genre, year, content rating or even actor. You can also click to see “Shows on Now,” which lets you see which movies, sports, news, or TV series are currently airing.

The results are displayed using large, photo thumbnails of the program, along with other details like channel and how many minutes are left in the program.

(Above: Android TV Watch Now selections)
The Program Guide also helps you find something to watch by making recommendations, based on what else you’ve been watching on Plex, and it will alert you to upcoming movies, sports, and other items of interest – like shows with new episodes or those starting soon.

(Above: iPad program guide)
Plex’s plan in venturing the live TV space is to offer consumers interested in cutting the cord a way to complement their Netflix or Amazon Prime Video subscriptions with access to the sort of television they would otherwise miss – especially local news and sports.
Plex is not exactly a full alternative to the higher-priced live TV streaming services like Sling TV, DirecTV Now, Hulu’s live TV service, YouTube TV, and PlayStation Vue. Those services bundle cable TV channels into packages and offer premium channels like HBO, while also, in many cases, include DVR recording functions.
But many consumers are tempted to subscribe to these services not for specific content, but because they miss the “always on” and passive nature of browsing live, linear TV for something to watch. In that case, Plex could fill their needs.
Plex also wants to target cord cutters because of that market’s potential for growth, the company says. 25 percent of U.S. homes are opting not to subscribe to traditional pay TV, a 2016 study found. And many who haven’t cut the cord are hanging on because they would miss their local broadcast stations – an area where Plex is poised to help.
The company tells us it now has 13 million registered users, though the active number is lower. The recent DVR feature was adopted by tens of thousands of subscribers, and, with support for live TV, Plex aims to grow its cord cutter audience to the hundreds of thousands.

Live TV, like the DVR recording option, isn’t offered at additional charge. It’s still covered by the usual Plex Pass subscription price of $4.99 per month. Plex also offers its subscription at discounted rates for yearly ($39.99) or lifetime ($119.99) subscribers.
The new feature will first be supported on Plex on any iOS or Android TV platform, including Nvidia Shield’s, with Android mobile and Apple TV to follow. Support for Plex’s additional platforms will roll out soon after, the company says.

 
Apple may finally get overtaken by Android in developer revenues this year (or so the analysts say), but today the iPhone maker passed a milestone of its own: the company said it has passed $70 billion in payouts to app developers, up from $50 billion about a year ago, after taking its commission.
And despite the fact that new smartphone purchases appear to have fallen off a cliff as many large markets reach saturation, growing just three percent in the last year, there is still a strong motor behind the apps ecosystem.
Apple says that in the past year (12 months), downloads are up “over 70 percent,” led by top games like Pokémon GO and Super Mario Run but also a range of other apps that include CancerAid, SPACE by THIX, Zones for Training with Exercise Intensity, Vanido, Ace Tennis and Havenly.
Indeed, perhaps unsurprisingly (this has been the case for years now) games and entertainment also continue to lead in terms of top-grossing categories. Lifestyle apps, as well as Health and Fitness, “have experienced over 70 percent growth in the past year,” Apple said, while photo and video are the fastest-growing up nearly 90 percent in the last year.
The comments come in the lead up to Apple’s annual developers’ conference, WWDC, and as such is a timely announcement.
Taking all Android handset makers, Google’s operating system has been outselling the iPhone for years now in terms of smartphone unit sales, but Apple has traditionally been seen as the most-profitable and most-used platform when it comes to apps on devices.
Now, however, some estimate that Google’s Android (that is, the official Google Play store plus other Android stores) may finally start to surpass Apple in revenues: figures from March from App Annie note that while it expects Apple to generate $60 billion in revenue annually by 2021, Google Play will bring in $42 billion and other Android stores $36 billion. With today’s announcement, Apple is keen to show that it’s continuing to yield benefits to app makers and publishers.
“People everywhere love apps and our customers are downloading them in record numbers,” said Philip Schiller, Apple’s senior vice president of Worldwide Marketing, in a statement. “Seventy billion dollars earned by developers is simply mind-blowing. We are amazed at all of the great new apps our developers create and can’t wait to see them again next week at our Worldwide Developers Conference.”
Along with this, Apple has been pushing new payment methods to improve how people in different kinds of economies can make in-app purchases. This has included adding carrier billing, where you can charge an app payment to your phone bill, or link it with your pre-pay credits — especially important to make headway in markets where credit card penetration is lower.
This also goes for subscriptions. While Apple takes a 30 percent cut on regular in-app payments, the percentage goes down to 15 percent for subscriptions over one year.
Apple says that since subscriptions are now open to developers across all 25 app categories, active paid subscriptions are up 58 percent year over year. Apple called out apps for Netflix and Hulu as leaders here, as well as the cooking app Tastemade, and photo apps Over and Enlight.
Baidu has two new German auto industry heavyweights on its side in the race to develop autonomous driving technology. Both Bosch and Continental are now partnered up with the Chinese internet giant to work together on not only automated driving, but also on connected cars in general and mobility services.
Both Continental and Bosch are key auto industry suppliers, and this partnership is about Baidu leveraging its experience in machine learning and computer intelligence tech, while its new partners within the industry will focus on spurring the hardware component and systems integration piece of the autonomous systems picture.
Bosch, which is a Tier 1 supplier to essentially every auto maker of significance in existence, and Continental, while best known for its tires, also works on advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) as well as the sensors used in automated driving.
Bosch has also been developing automated driving technologies since 2011, the company says. As part of the agreement, Bosch will be providing sensors, other hardware components and vehicle localization support for Baidu’s Apollo open autonomous driving platform.
These are key partners as Baidu begins to figure out how to commercialize its self-driving tech, which is what Apollo is all about. The platform would be available to OEs and other auto industry players, providing off-the-shelf vehicle autonomy without the heavy lifting.
Security firm BullGuard has launched a consumer-focused Internet of Things product in the U.S., following its acquisition of Israeli startup Dojo-Labs last year.
The startup had been stealthily working on the network monitoring device designed for smart homes all the way back in 2014, before showing off the physical pebble-shaped device for displaying visual alerts in 2015 — and starting to take pre-orders.
As well as the pebble’s traffic-light style visual alerts, an in-app messaging interface aims to make it easier for consumers to manage smart home security needs across a range of different connected devices.
While the team’s original aim was to start shipping in March 2016 that date came and went with no Dojo. Then in August last year Dojo-Labs was acquired by UK security firm BullGuard. Getting the device to market would be its “immediate focus”, the larger security firm said at the time.
Nine months later the Dojo is finally shipping — albeit, only in the U.S., where the smart home has built up more momentum vs many other markets.
It’s being priced at $199, which includes the first 12-months of service. Thereafter the ongoing service charge is $99 per year or $9.99 per month.
All traffic on a home network has to be routed via the Dojo for it to be able to see what’s going on across all your various connected devices and thus perform its anomaly detection function. So, while the hero shots of the device may look pretty, you’ll need to plug the white box into your wi-fi router with an Ethernet cable. You’ll also need to be comfortable proving a third party company with data stream visibility of your home network.
Once plugged in to the wi-fi, the Dojo generates a view of all the devices connected to the network and continuously monitors activity. It uses machine learning and pattern matching to determine what’s normal and what’s a potential problem — flagging alerts to the user when it spots something suspicious, by displaying red or amber lights on the pebble and/or via in-app alerts.
While the product certainly looks to have been thoughtfully designed, it remains to be seen how well it functions against IoT hacking risks.
And how much demand there will be for what is effectively a new category of security product. The key question here is whether consumers can be sold on the idea that they are the ones who should have to pay a subscription service to secure a smart home — vs robust security being a baked into their IoT devices from the get-go.
The old song tells us that the leg bone is connected to the hip bone, but how are we to know if the articulated cam can connect to the brushless motor? There are, sadly, no songs designed to tell us how to build robots. Luckily CMU’s Ruta Desai has us covered.
His project, “Computational Abstractions for Interactive Design of Robotic Devices,” is essentially a robotics toolkit. You see a set of parts that you can drag and drop to connect together and a complex physics engine ensures that wheels go where they work the best and motors are connected properly. This means you can’t create a robot that will fall over as soon as it moves forward. The tool also recommends parts to add to your robot to make it work better or be more structurally sound.
“The process of creating new robotic systems today is notoriously challenging, time-consuming and resource-intensive,” said co-creator of the project Stelian Coros. “In the not-so-distant future, however, robots will be part of the fabric of daily life and more people — not just roboticists — will want to customize robots. This type of interactive design tool would make this possible for just about anybody.”
In short this project makes it easier to put together the building blocks of real robotics and simulate what will happen when you activate the motors and sensors. In one test they created a robotic puppy that, after simulation, they “discovered could only walk forward and not sideways.” They tweaked it a bit and then built the project, finding they now had a puppy that could walk sideways.
It’s sort of like Scratch for robots, say the researchers.
“Our work aims to make robotics more accessible to casual users,” said Coros. “This could accelerate the adoption of robots in everyday life.”
This one’s for you, startups in sub-Saharan Africa. TechCrunch is excited to be partnering with Facebook to bring our illustrious startup competition, the Startup Battlefield, to Nairobi, Kenya later this year, and we’re looking for some promising startups to take part in the inaugural Startup Battlefield Africa.
Startups can apply to one of three categories: social good, productivity and utility or gaming and entertainment. As long as your company fits into one of these categories and you meet the eligibility criteria at the bottom of this post, you are encouraged to apply no later than July 14, 2017 at 5pm PST.
The application can be found here. Companies selected to participate will be notified by August 21.
TechCrunch will host Startup Battlefield Africa in Nairobi in front of a live audience and prominent judges in each category, and we will live stream the show on TechCrunch and Facebook so the rest of the world can tune in.
The judges will choose a winner in each category and select an overall winner, “Sub-Saharan Africa’s Most Promising Startup,” whose founders will win $25,000 USD in no-equity cash plus an all-expense paid trip for two to San Francisco to compete in the Battlefield at TechCrunch’s flagship event, Disrupt SF 2018.
We’re especially excited to be hosting this event during a period of promising growth for the region. Sub-Saharan Africa just produced its first unicorn, online shopping site Jumia, exits in the region are increasingly frequent and VCs all around the world are taking notice.
The Startup Battlefield Africa event will take place October 11 in Nairobi, Kenya at a location to be announced. We hope to see you and your promising social good, productivity and utility or gaming and entertaining company there.
Additional information about eligibility criteria and the event itself is found below.
Here’s how to participate
Startups must fit into one of three categories (social good, productivity and utility or gaming and entertainment) to participate. Five startups in each category will be selected to join us onstage for the Battlefield Africa in Nairobi.
Apart from clear relevance to one of the three themes, qualifying startups should:

Be early-stage companies in “launch” stage
Be a resident from our eligible countries
Have a fully working product/beta, reasonably close to or in production
Have received limited press or publicity to date
Have no known intellectual property conflicts

What do the winners receive?
Apart from the exposure that comes from pitching to the global TechCrunch audience, as well as the live audience of distinguished technologists, entrepreneurs and investors in Nairobi, the overall winner will receive $25,000 in no-equity cash plus an all-expense paid trip for two to San Francisco to compete in the Battlefield at TechCrunch’s flagship event, Disrupt SF in 2018.
Are costs to attend the pitch-off covered?
No, but TechCrunch will try to find financial assistance for a startup in need of assistance to reach the Nairobi event.
Who picks the startups that will compete?
The TechCrunch editors who run the TechCrunch Startup Battlefield competition will choose the finalists from the application pool.
Who will judge the pitch-offs?
TechCrunch and Facebook will select four judges for each theme. They will be noted entrepreneurs, investors and technologists with experience relevant to the category. A TechCrunch editor will moderate the judging and cast the tie-breaker ballot, if needed.
What is the pitch-off format?
Each company will have five minutes to present. The judges will have five minutes to ask questions. Live demos are strongly encouraged.
What are the judging criteria?Productivity and Utility — The judges will pick the startup with the product or service most likely to go into full commercial production and have the biggest impact on human potential and/or the largest exit.
Social Good — The judges will look for the startup with the product most likely to catalyze social and economic development through technology.

There’s been a whole lot of talk about initial coin offerings (ICO), company fundraising events based around the sale of cryptocurrencies, but not much in the way of action until yesterday. That’s when web browser maker Brave, founded by former Mozilla CEO Brendan Eich, raised $35 million from its ICO — and it did it in less than 30 seconds, too.
ICOs operate by selling investors cryptocurrency, which can be used to store value in many ways beyond a traditional share. For its sale, Brave created its own coin — The Basic Attention Token, or BAT — and sold one billion of them. That collection of BAT cost 156,250 ETH, which is just over $35 million. A further 500 million BAT is stored for user growth and “BAT development,” according to Brave, which is not planning another token sale in the future.
The ICO is the highest grossing to date, and Brave’s business itself is one of the more interesting to make use the blockchain. Eich, who created JavaScript but left Mozilla in 2014 in controversial circumstances, had raised $7 million from investors including Founders Fund for Brave. He believes the current internet advertising system is inherently broken, and his ambitious proposal uses the blockchain to make things more efficient for all parties, advertisers, publishers and users, too.
Kik, a messaging service popular with young people in North America, recently announced plans for its own ‘Kin’ coin which it will use as a virtual currency to pay for related goods and services, and that’s the same approach Brave has taken. It plans to use BAT the currency for its advertising system, which it claims can reduce ad fraud and increase efficiencies for publishers and advertisers. It is also assessing the potential for micropayments and buying digital goods with BAT in the future.
Brave’s pitch to consumers is faster loading times, tighter privacy controls and even the potential to earn money simply by reading content.
More immediately, it said it will use the proceeds of this ICO to develop its advertising platform.

One notable anecdote of the Brave ICO is how the process was dominated by a handful of individuals. Only around 130 people actually bought BAT, Coindesk noted, with one buyer scooping up $4.6 million of them (20,000 ETH worth). All in all, Coindesk reported that five buyers acquired half of the total haul, while the 20 biggest spenders bought two-thirds of the available coins.
That situation runs counter to the thesis that many in Ethereum hold, which is that token sales enable anyone to take ownership of the companies they use or follow. Of course larger, organized investors — including adventurous corporations or early moving VC firms — are a key component when a company sells tens of millions of dollars of coins, but ensuring that there is space for smaller parties is going to be an ever critical challenge as ICOs become more commonplace.
Aside from Kik, which hasn’t given a specific date, Asia-based payment firm Omise is gearing up to raise just under $20 million from a token sale this month as the phenomenon begins to find interest among more established (and venture-backed) tech companies.

Hubble, a London-headquartered a startup founded in 2014 to ride the coattails of the trend towards flexible office space, has picked up £1.2 million in new funding. Leading the round is Firestartr, with participation by 500 Startups, Maxfield Capital, and Concrete. The latter is a ‘proptech’ fund backed by Seedcamp and Starwood Capital and for which Hubble is its first tech investment.
Founded by Tushar Agarwal (CEO), Tom Watson (CTO) and Rohan Silva (founder of Second Home, and former advisor to ex-British Prime Minister David Cameron), the company began life helping startups find spare office space. However, it has since expanded its platform to also serve the needs of traditional SMEs and larger corporates — and, I’m told, is seeing a huge uptick in companies wanting more flexibility since the result of the Brexit referendum.
More broadly, Agarwal tells me, Hubble’s growth is a reflection of how the commercial property market is shifting away from lengthy, multi-year office space leases to short term rentals with ‘out of the box’ features, and therefore less commitment or costs up front.
It’s also a change, he argues, that traditional property letting agents aren’t well-positioned to cope with and where technology is the only way to scale because of the increase in the sheer number of transactions, which also typically carry a lower basket price.
To that end, as it stands, Hubble operates an online marketplace that matches companies needing flexible office space with landlords and commercial space providers, such as the WeWorks of this world.
With today’s new capital, however — and to better serve its growing client base — the startup is building out its platform to act more like a “digital commercial property advisor” that will better use the data Hubble has and is accumulating to automate the office space search process in a more personal or bespoke way.
Adds Agarwal in a statement: “Hubble is the driving force behind a trend that is seeing traditional commercial property agents quickly becoming obsolete. As technology has enabled the number of freelancers and SMEs in the world to grow at an unprecedented rate, they are rapidly displacing Fortune 500 companies from the physical real estate they traditionally occupy – the bread and butter of traditional agents. The economics of the labour intensive model of property agents just don’t stack up with the future of work.”
Julie Desk, a French startup that’s developed an AI-driven “virtual assistant” to automate the scheduling of meetings, appointments, and more, has picked up €2.5 million in new funding — money it plans to use to further develop the technology. Backing the company this time around are previous investors SIDE Capital, Entrepreneur Venture, and SAAS Lab.
In some ways similar to U.S. competitor X.ai, Julie Desk can be thought of as a machine learning-based replacement for a PA. You simply CC “Julie” at the start of or during an email thread with the person you want to schedule a meeting with, and, in theory, the virtual assistant will take care of the rest.
This includes offering up potential meeting times — pulled in from the various online calendars supported — confirming the agreed time and place, adding it to your schedule and sending out the appropriate calendar invites.
The technology also ties into restaurant bookings, and Julie Desk has further integrations planned. This includes support for Skype for Business to create call URLs on the fly for scheduled conference calls. Another potential tie-in, but one that is further in the future, is automating travel bookings, something that other AI-powered virtual assistants have tried before.
“Once you integrate with a person’s calendar, there is a lot more you can do,” Julie Desk co-founder and CEO Julien Hobeika tells me.
One other interesting aspect of Julie Desk — and something Hobeika is refreshingly candid about — is that the startup openly operates a hybrid model, with its AI being underpinned by continuous human supervision. It sees a human check every final appointment made and editing the very few that aren’t correct, whilst in turn further training the startup’s algorithms.
This, says the Julie Desk founder, is both necessary for quality assurance purposes, and is also a huge selling point around trust, which is particularly relevant for larger corporate customers where a failure in scheduling could cost customers.
Walmart, the world’s largest retailer, will soon be using virtual reality to help train its employees on topics like management and customer service.
VR instruction will be used at each of the retailer’s 200 “Walmart Academy” training centers in the U.S. by the end of the year, helping educate the estimated 150,000 employees that will go through the program each year. Each location will have an Oculus Rift headset and gaming PC showcasing a collection of VR training content.
The virtual reality instruction Walmart will be using is entirely 360-degree video-based and will include interactive on-screen cues asking trainees to make decisions after encountering various situations. These scenarios may be related to customer service, management or seasonal situations like encountering the Black Friday rush in VR.
Training experiences will range from around thirty seconds to about five minutes and are meant to supplement traditional instruction.
The startup building these training experiences is STRIVR Labs, a relatively low-profile VR company that had previously focused largely on developing VR training for collegiate and professional athletics programs.
So, how did a deal like this get put together? Well, it all started when Brock McKeel, a senior director of operations at Walmart, saw the University of Arkansas football team using VR experiences built by STRIVR during practice. Following what the startup’s CEO Derek Belch referred to as a “fortuitous inbound,” STRIVR met with the retailer and launched a pilot program at the end of January at thirty of its training centers. During this time, the companies worked together to determine what virtual reality experiences made sense for Walmart in a training scenario, Belch says.
“We don’t do anything that is not a good use case for VR,” he said. “We have experiences for the lowest-level bagger all the way up to the store management.”
Now, a few months later the deal between the two has been signed and STRIVR is already gathering interest from new customers, including a financial service company and a major auto manufacturer.
STRIVR Labs is notable in that it’s a profitable virtual reality startup. Belch wouldn’t talk exact numbers but noted that over the past two years the company has done “several million in revenue,” noting that the exact number was north of $10 million. The company has raised $5 million in funding from Signia Venture Partners, BMW i Ventures, Advancit Capital and Presence Capital.
“When you have literally the biggest company in the world as your first enterprise customer, that’s kind of a big deal,” Belch told TechCrunch.

Silicon Valley has very few executives that have a LatinX background, and today’s Breaking Into Startups Episode features a young Dominican from vice president of sales for a company called Hustle.
Hustle is a venture-backed, peer-to-peer text messaging platform.
Hustle is also a word that people use to describe selling or promoting energetically and Ysiad’s strategies and tactics took the company from $0 to $5 million in booked revenue in eighteen months.

As a Dominican who grew up on welfare in the Bronx, he is sharing this story about an aspect of his life that few people know about in an effort to inspire those who grew up like him  —  those without the privileges that most people who work for startups take for granted.
Ysiad and I were roommates at Agape and this episode goes into detail about how a strong sales organization is structured at the seed stage, the types of candidates that get hired, sales fundamentals, compensation, struggles with background checks, second chances, and more.

Family and the Importance of Education:
Ysiad’s mother immigrated as a teenager from the Dominican Republic, raised him as a single parent and his first language was Spanish.
He learned English in elementary school and was fortunate enough to earn a spot in a program called Prep for Prep, which in turn got him a scholarship to Horace Mann, a private school in New York City.
He got into the University of Pennsylvania on a full Annenberg Scholarship, but quickly dropped out due to a couple of factors:

Impatience. He did not want to wait until completing college to make money. And he realized that he had other opportunities — like starting a real estate brokerage in New York City. Nobody was using Craigslist yet to advertise property in that market, so he used that channel to build a business.
He was on probation, and he wanted to reduce his risk of being sent to prison for participating in the normal activities of someone engaging in a social life at an Ivy League university.

Wait, probation and prison?
Yea, that might surprise anyone who arrived here from a Google search, Twitter, or a blog post about product updates, so let’s back up a few years.
Getting to Horace Mann was both a source of pride and embarrassment.
Pride: It is one of the best high schools in the United States and it was a privilege to go there.
Embarrassment: His scholarship didn’t cover school lunches or the school bus.

Fighting Starvation By Any Means Necessary
Ysiad’s mother was raising his family on public assistance.

For those of you that don’t know, if you are on public assistance your children get free meals at public schools. The food stamp program was built to factor in these free meals for children, which weren’t available at his private school. There wasn’t enough money in food stamps to make him lunch and also have dinner, so he was constantly hungry.

Ysiad wished he could have worked to pay for his own lunch, but he was too young for work papers, so he couldn’t even get a job after school.
With the deck stacked against him, he did all that he could in order to keep his head up and not fall into a victim mentality.
Getting to school alone presented its own challenges because there was a gang war going on in the late 90’s in NYC and he had to cross several of them on his way to class.
He used a bicycle until the bicycle was stolen. After that he ran to school with his backpack. His cover story was that I needed to make weight for wrestling.
Even though Ysiad is Dominican, gangs would target him for initiations because he looked white and after a number of physical altercations, he got worn down.
For protection and respect, he decided to start his own crew and built a reputation in the neighborhood. Things escalated.


Bad Decisions and Their Consequences
While he had the goal of earning enough money so his mother and sisters wouldn’t have to steal, he was comfortable doing whatever he had to do in order to put food on the table.
He sold illegal cable boxes to his classmates, stole from the cafeteria, and even from many of his classmates. Stealing from his peers cultivated a deeper shame while making it difficult to create trusting friendships.
By age 15, he found himself in a management position in a criminal enterprise. Fast forward a bit, and the result of this was him pleading guilty to robbery in the first degree, possession of stolen property, and assault with a deadly weapon.
That’s how he got on probation from the ages of 16 to 21. He considers himself lucky because things could have been a lot worse.
Navigating the criminal justice system at such a young age affected his life in many ways.
First, he caused his family stress and shame.
Second, he feared that if people found out what he had done, the truth would inhibit him from achieving his goals of making something of himself, financially supporting his family, and getting out of the Bronx.

Secrets and Reflection on Past Actions
Ysiad figured out how to keep his arrest, subsequent plea, and probation status a secret from his classmates and the administration at his school. If they had found out, they definitely would have expelled him.
By then he was old enough to work so he quit the after-school sports teams he was a part of, found a computer on a train, and got a job as a computer programmer (more detail on that in the podcast).
From that point forward, he would pay for his own food instead of stealing it.
He lied on his college applications saying he hadn’t been arrested, and was accepted into a number of Ivy League universities with full scholarships.
He accepted a spot at the University of Pennsylvania.
In retrospect, he is 100% confident that he could have found a way to buy food and commute to school safely without engaging in criminal activity.
But he also empathizes with his 15-year-old self. Being an at-risk youth means not always having the privilege and perspective to think strategically.


The 17 Year-Old Hustle: Probation and Dropping Out of College
Attending UPenn required updates to Ysiad’s Probation Officer on his whereabouts and he was not allowed to change states without getting permission ahead of time.
He also had to stay out of trouble completely and a single probation violation not only risked further shame to his family, but would also mean 12 or more years of incarceration at an adult facility.
The location requirement made it impossible for him to join a sports team or club that interacted with other universities. Staying out of trouble meant that he could not safely participate in the sorts of social activities his peers were a part of. And he certainly did not want to explain why.
So he dropped out of college and started some businesses — a t-shirt company, household moving, home repairs, and later a fair-trade importing company.
Each one was a little more successful than the last. As they were all self-funded, he had to learn to bootstrap and inspire people to work with him despite not having money to pay fixed salaries. That typically meant hiring people of non-traditional backgrounds, helping them quickly grow to the responsibilities that needed to be met, and working on projects that generated cash-flow quickly enough to pay everyone.
Somewhere along the line a former employee introduced him to a friend of his who had a lucrative career as a consultant for hedge funds. He started staying up late reading financial books, brought his computer programming skills up to a professional level, got an internship at a hedge fund, and then leveraged that position to get a formal interview with that friend of a friend where he convinced him to take a chance on him.
The company was still small enough that it did not conduct background checks, so shortly thereafter, Ysiad began consulting.
Clients started asking for Ysiad by name, and there was more work than the company could handle.
The next challenge was to build a successful team.
Ysiad’s previous experience hiring people of nontraditional backgrounds proved very helpful because his talent pool was wider and he was able to hire people quicker than their competitors.
Everything was going well until the company grew to approximately 30 people and started running background checks. Rather than tell the partners of the firm about his past  —  knowing that they would be required to fire him and tell his customers  — he quit before filling out the form agreeing to a background check.


Finding Happiness Through Hiding From Background Checks
Ysiad was emotionally shattered.
He had finally reached a different socioeconomic status, but had to give it up because of his struggles with background checks.
Ysiad did what a lot of young rich people do when they need to process things and take time off — he went into nature, bicycled a thousand miles from Boston to Ann Arbor, took an international trip (moving to India for a year and a half), and did some feel-good, yet light hearted charity work where he and a friend came up with the idea of “The International Day of Happiness.”
That idea led to a resolution by the United Nations, and The International Day of Happiness is now on March 20th every year.
After all of that reflection, he decided to move to San Francisco, where he thought organizations might be less likely to run background checks on their employees.

The Purpose Driven Organizer
In San Francisco, he lived in house called Agape with Cory Rae Shaw  —  Hustle’s first graphic designer  — and Perry Rosenstein  —  one of Hustle’s founders.
Perry was always talking about politics, but Ysiad had always been pretty skeptical of politics.
When Ysiad was growing up, politicians and activists from outside of his community would approach his neighborhood and tell them that if they wanted change, they needed to vote.
Their messages sounded great, but Ysiad learned to be wary of politicians and the campaign workers who worked to get them elected because he felt that most of them were full of empty promises that led to zero results or things that were contradictory to their initial message.
As Perry and Ysiad continued their conversations, Perry kept saying that while many of Ysiad’s concerns were true, Hustle’s platform was not only being used by organizers reaching LatinX and other underserved communities in ways that had never been done, but also helping them build power leading to actual results.
When Ysiad saw the ~90%+ open rates, ~30–50% engagement from Perry’s initial groups, he thought about other use cases in criminal justice from his interactions with his probation officers, ways to speak to his neighborhood through community leaders they trusted, and immediately agreed to do some consulting to help with sales and marketing.

New Beginnings
Ysiad soon saw that the work Hustle was doing changed the ways that he thought about politics and activism.
When he first joined Hustle, he was focused on political issues like immigration reform and for the cost of less than a single postcard, he was able to bridge the digital divide by helping campaign organizers send personalized texts to people across targeted groups.
If the organizers wanted to reach people like Ysiad’s mom, who primarily speaks Spanish, they could communicate with them by text in their constituents’ preferred language.
This allowed campaigns to develop appropriate messaging in a variety of languages to reach everyone in a comfortable and respectful way.
Ysiad helped organizers use Hustle to send over 60 million messages to 12 million people and got the platform into the hands of reputable advocacy groups, non-profits, and labor unions with phenomenal results
Hustle is quickly expanding its strong position in politics and labor, but is also working on expanding verticals and empowering leaders in education, faith communities, healthcare, call centers, and more.
As someone in an executive position at a fast growing startup, Ysiad now feels the responsibility to help people that have been struggling to overcome decisions they may have made in their past that affect their background in a negative way.
Maybe they have a criminal record like he does, or maybe they don’t look or sound like what people expect them to. Whatever their story is, Ysiad is a Dominican from the Bronx that can’t knock the hustle when he sees it.

NTT Data, the large Tokyo-based global IT services provider, today announced that it has made a strategic investment in database provider MarkLogic. The two companies declined to reveal the size of the investment, but Dave Ponzini, MarkLogic’s EVP of Marketing and Corporate Development, tells me it was “not a huge amount but not an insignificant amount either.” So far, MarkLogic has raised a total of more than $173 million, including a massive $102 million Series F round in 2015.
MarkLogic positions itself as a database system for integrating data from various data silos, something that’s a growing problem for large enterprises as they look into how they can get the most value out of their data. Over the years (and often because of acquisitions), different groups in a company often use different database systems, and now they are looking for ways to bring all of this information together again. Typically, the way to do that is by bringing that data into a schema-less NoSQL database, which is where MarkLogic comes in.
Given this focus, it’s no surprise that the company’s customer base is mostly comprised of Global 2000 companies. While MarkLogic doesn’t disclose its exact revenue numbers, Ponzini noted that annual revenue is now “north of $100 million.”
NTT Data started using MarkLogic back in 2012, but mostly to build applications for its customers. The company then also started reselling the database and, according to Ponzini, this allowed MarkLogic to make inroads into the financial services market, for example. Today’s investment cements this relationship between the two companies and will allow MarkLogic to enter many of the markets in which NTT Data is very strong (like Spain), but where MarkLogic currently doesn’t have offices. There is quite a bit of overlap between the two companies’ geographical presence, though, and in those regions where both operate, NTT Data will market the database to its customers.
“NTT DATA is excited to expand our strategic relationship with MarkLogic. We look forward to extending the success we have jointly experienced over the last five years in Japan to the rest of the world,” said Toshio Iwamoto, president and CEO of NTT Data, in today’s announcement. “Our ability to solve complex data integration problems by using MarkLogic’s database platform alongside intellectual capital developed by NTT DATA allows our clients to better analyze critical insights from their data in order to gain a  competitive advantage in their respective marketplaces.”
Only a few weeks ago, MarkLogic launched version 9 of its database. The emphasis in this release was on security, with new features like element-level permissions and redactions, for example. “We’ve always been the most secure NoSQL database,” MarkLogic EVP Joe Pasqua told me. “But the new aspect that we wanted to push was sharing with less risk.” Once you’ve brought all of your information together, the question becomes who can access it. With element-level security, enterprises can ensure that their data can be used effectively, even as some of the information remains hidden to most users.

Time Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes talked about the pending sale to AT&T onstage at Code Conference in Rancho Palos Verdes, Calif. on Wednesday.
Bewkes told the largely tech and media crowd that he doesn’t think the Trump administration will have a big impact on the proposed deal, despite previous claims by the president that he’s against it. Bewkes hoped that the Department of Justice would make a decision based on historical precedent.
But one policy area that the new administration is likely to impact is the regulation related to net neutrality. Unsurprisingly, Bewkes took the side of the cable giants and said that Google and Facebook aren’t currently held to the same standards. “There’s no reason that they should have more lax standards of data use than other competitors,” he griped. 
He also talked about internet streaming and the impact that cord-cutting will have on the content business. Time Warner owns properties including HBO and CNN, but he believes that regardless of what screen people are watching it on, “you’re going to subscribe to it in one form or another.”
Bewkes also discussed the controversial role that CNN played in the political election. When asked if too much airtime helped Trump in the primaries, he quipped “could somebody tell him? He seems to be a prominent person who doesn’t know that.” Trump supporters have accused the channel of being biased toward Clinton.
He said that Trump initially got more air time than the other Republican primary candidates because “when you asked the others to come, they didn’t come,” suggesting that Trump was the most willing candidate to appear on TV. 
As for the election, “we were simply trying to cover it,” said Bewkes, but “we’re constantly looking at it to see if we can get it better.”
Uber’s head of finance, Gautam Gupta, is leaving the company in July, The Wall Street Journal reports. TechCrunch has since confirmed this news with Uber. Gupta’s plan is to join another San Francisco-based startup as COO, but it’s not clear what that startup is. News of his impending departure comes as Uber has reported losses of $708 million.
In Q1, Uber’s revenue was $3.4 billion, an 18 percent increase from its last quarter. Uber suffered losses of $708 million, not including employee stock compensation “other items,” the WSJ reports. In the three months prior, Uber’s losses were $991 million, which means that its losses are narrowing. Uber has $7.2 billion in cash on hand, according to the report. Uber’s gross bookings are also up 9 percent.
“These results demonstrate that our business remains healthy and resilient as we focus on improving our culture, management and relationship with drivers,” an Uber spokesperson told TechCrunch. “The narrowing of our losses in the first quarter puts us on a good trajectory towards profitability.”
This means that in addition to looking for a number-two executive to team up with Uber CEO Travis Kalanick, Uber will now also need someone to lead up its financial team. Uber, which has not had a chief financial officer since 2015 — when Brent Callinicos bounced and ultimately joined Hyperloop One — is now on the hunt for an official CFO. The company is specifically looking for someone with experience at a public company, or experience taking a company public.
It’s been a rough year for Uber, between allegations of sexual harassment and a series of departures of top-level people at the company. Yesterday, Uber fired Anthony Levandowski, the engineer accused of stealing thousands of documents pertaining to self-driving technology from Google. And just last week, Uber lost its general counsel for the Middle East, Europe and Africa.

The FCC claimed earlier this month that the comment system by which people can weigh in on the proposal to kill net neutrality had been on the receiving end of a distributed denial-of-service attack. Today, a group of Senators asked that the FBI look into it.
Brian Schatz (D-Hawai‘i), Al Franken (D-Minn.), Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), Ed Markey (D-Mass.) and Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) penned a letter to FBI Director Andrew McCabe suggesting the matter was too troubling to let alone.
“Any cyberattack on a federal network is very serious,” the letter reads. “This particular attack may have denied the American people the opportunity to contribute to what is supposed to be a fair and transparent process, which in turn may call into question the integrity of the FCC’s rulemaking proceedings. We request that you update us on the status of the FBI’s investigation and brief us on this matter by June 23, 2017.”
The FCC has been rather quiet on the topic despite requests from Congress to explain and document the attack. Some at the time thought that the comment system had been taken down by the large volume directed at it by a John Oliver segment on net neutrality that aired shortly before.
But the system was upgraded specifically to prevent it from going down under that kind of attention, and the FCC was unequivocal in its statement about the attacks, issued on May 8:
Beginning on Sunday night at midnight, our analysis reveals that the FCC was subject to multiple distributed denial-of-service attacks. These were deliberate attempts by external actors to bombard the FCC’s comment system with a high amount of traffic to our commercial cloud host. These actors were not attempting to file comments themselves; rather they made it difficult for legitimate commenters to access and file with the FCC.
Since then, however, the Commission has offered no hard evidence, publicly at least, that substantiates this analysis. Perhaps the Senators’ letter will hurry that along.
Notably, the letter suggests that the purported attacks “question the integrity of the FCC’s rulemaking proceedings.” The Senators in question are vocally pro-net-neutrality and have spoken out against Chairman Ajit Pai’s proposal to roll back the rules. It’s more than possible that they are attempting to delegitimize the process by which that proposal is effected: If nefarious actors interfered, and America did not have a fair chance to weigh in, how can it be said to be a transparent and open process?
Whatever the case, we should know on or around June 23.

If you want to re-imagine cities, you’ll likely work with city government. Sometimes this means city governments will your customer, but far more often founders will encounter an unfamiliar relationship that includes policy, regulations and enforcement.
There are great resources to guide founders through all aspects of customer discovery, but there aren’t yet great frameworks for thinking about city governments. Or so we thought, until we realized that some great research might be repurposed to help founders understand how to work with organizations that are representing public interests.
Understanding local government power
Local governments have substantial influence over how cities are built and how they operate. But this power takes different forms. For example, although most city governments own buildings, they’re usually just one of a number of larger real estate owners in a city. Would it make sense to begin selling building energy services exclusively to local governments? Probably not. This would mean having to navigate city procurement and you’d miss large segments of the market. Building a sales organization focused on government sales requires different skills and relationships versus the type of organization you might build to sell into private real estate owners.
This doesn’t mean you can ignore city government’s role in building retrofits. A growing number of cities have set policies that already (or will soon) require changes to buildings, such as Palo Alto’s Net Zero Energy Initiative. They’re doing this as part of increasingly aggressive goals to get to zero emissions for their communities. So while city government might not be your first customer, it is worthwhile to understand which cities are further along in their policy agendas. And how these policy agendas might support local sales strategies.
It’s not just policy than can helpful. There might be a mayor who has articulated a strong interest in a subject like building retrofits, for example. In this case, even without strong policy or regulatory control, a city government is likely to be a great ally in connecting with potential partners and customers.
C40 City Government Power Surveys
C40 is a network of the world’s megacities committed to addressing climate change. They create research to be shared between members with a goal of helping them meet their climate action goals.
C40 cities have a specific interest in understand how city mayors can use their power to drive climate action. They surveyed their members and asked them about their roles in owning or operating certain assets or their ability to create and enforce regulations. Responses from cities detailed their control over assets and activities from buildings to cycling.<
It’s important to remember that these questions were tailored to assets that C40 believes are relevant to climate change, but it still gives a good sense of the wide range of powers that cities have via ownership and operation.

You can see why a city government might not be the end customer in many scenarios. In a large number of cases, mayors simply don’t own or operate relevant assets. In other cases, the answers is less clear – startups might start off focused focused on B2G, but then find themselves focused on B2B.
Policies, regulations and enforcement
AirBnB, Lyft and Uber are the first generation of startups whose work with governments has become just as important as their work with customers. In fact, Uber’s lawsuits with local governments around the world is a great map of the many ways in which local policy and enforcement can impact a startup. When you look at the C40 analysis, you can see why. Over 80% of the time, mayors responded that they can set or influence policy and enforcement.

Partnering with city government isn’t like business partnerships. It starts simply with understanding what is likely to make local governments care about your issue. Governments are likely to react to two major groups. First, your customers. If you do something customers like, they’ll likely be supportive. This doesn’t mean they’ll ignore smaller groups of business interests, especially if those groups can show how their failure would have negative consequences for citizens like lost employment opportunities.
Mapping City Power
C40 produced a range of power maps, showing the relative power of local government over activities and assets like sidewalks, airports, cycling, water, power distribution. As the example shows below, the larger the area, the more control local governments have. Or put another way, when the area is larger, governments are mostly likely to be your customer or at least have a major impact via policy, regulations or enforcement. The smaller the areas are, the less relevant local governments will be to your business.
Example: power

Example: sidewalks

We often meet founders who want to access sidewalk infrastructure like light posts or bus shelters. It’s clear that city government has significant power over these assets. What’s less clear is how city government will respond to different sidewalk activities. For example, if you ride a bike on a sidewalk, depending on where you are, you’re likely breaking a local law. But what if you use an electric wheelchair or an electric board or robots?
“Our streets and our sidewalks are made for people, not robots,” said Supervisor Yee in an interview with Recode. “This is consistent with how we operate in the city, where we don’t allow bikes or skateboards on sidewalks.” Interestingly, Supervisor Yee also mentioned a concern about jobs. And just like that, sidewalk use is no longer about safety, but about jobs.
Example: cycling

City governments have significant power over sidewalks and they also control roads. So they certainly have the power to build out bike infrastructure like bike lanes and bike parking. What happens when cities also start to hire bikeshare operators?
The current bikeshare model presumes that you need space on the sidewalk and road for the docking systems used to manage bikeshare. But a new generation of bikeshare can be deployed without the need for any docking startups. That is, they need the same amount of space as a privately owned bike.
Can cities limit competition with their own bikeshare systems? This is going to lead to a complex debate, so it’s no wonder that one of the dockless bikeshare teams, is working with Molly Turner, who has helped AirBnB understand and work with city governments.
Votes and jobs
Founders are used to dealing with customers with relatively simple expectations related to faster, better or cheaper. City governments frequently respond to a more complex mix of motivations. In the case of C40, city governments are working to achieving climate goals like reduced greenhouse gas emissions. There is no longer much doubt about how this serves the public interest and more and more citizens are simply voting for mayors that will act on climate.
But the sidewalk discussion in San Francisco hints at a more common motivation. Certainly public safety is a concern, but almost always, top of mayor’s agenda is economic development or jobs.  In fact, if you follow the arc of AirBnB’s interactions with city governments, their latest iteration is focused on jobs. Jobs also complicate roles for Uber and Lyft, who have very publicly indicated their focus on autonomous vehicles. They’ll lose their claims to generate economic opportunity.
City government discovery
Urbantech founders need to understand their customers, but they also need to understand their biggest stakeholder, city governments.
When city governments control relevant budgets and operations, it’s possible they’d be a great first customer. More importantly, it’s city government vision, policy, regulatory and enforcement objectives that will impact how founders interact with cities.
As teams scale, they’ll attract interest from regulators and policymakers, perhaps at the urging of an incumbent. But early on, teams are unlikely to attract much attention. That’s just as well since it’s hard to enough just to build something customers want.
Were you one of the many parents surprised to find hundreds of dollars’ worth of Smurfberries charged to your card a few years back? Amazon’s lax in-app purchasing standards let kids all over the country buy coins and crystals to their hearts’ content, something the FTC frowned on. News that refunds would be available soon broke in April, and the time has come at last.
Eligible customers should automatically receive an email from Amazon, or you can check here. If you think you should get a refund but haven’t heard from them, go to the Message Center in your Amazon account and see if there’s anything there (it might have gone to your spam folder).
There’s no big hurry: you have a full year to submit your requests for refunds.
If you’re curious about the specifics of the case, the FTC keeps the relevant documents here.
It’s been a banner year for The Pokémon Company: Pokémon GO was a global phenomenon and the latest full-on Pokégame for the 3DS sold very well indeed. One would expect the company to be doing well financially — perhaps even doubling or tripling last year’s profits. Well, apparently it quinvigintupled them, which is to say multiplied by 25 times. (I had to look it up.)
The news comes courtesy of TechCrunch (CrunchGear, technically) alum Serkan Toto, who noticed the line item in Japan’s Kanpo gazette. Private companies don’t have to report all their financials, but many post a summary in the gazette regularly.
Last year’s net profit was a mere $5.6 million, down from $18.4 million the year before that (probably owing to Pokémon X&Y sales). But this year’s net profit? ¥15.92 billion, or $143.3 million. That’s more than 25 times last year’s take.
We knew the game was printing money, of course — it had reportedly created a billion in revenue as early as February. Unfortunately, there’s no exact breakdown of these enormous amounts; for example, how much came from in-app purchases and how much came from sponsorship deals. We recently found out that McDonalds and others are paying surprisingly large sums to… lure customers to their stores.
The gravy train won’t stop there, either. Who knows how much they’re making from Magikarp Jump?

On Wednesday, an appellate court shot down Silk Road creator Ross Ulbricht’s effort to avoid spending the rest of his life behind bars. Two years ago, Ulbricht was sentenced to life in prison for his role in running the dark web exchange, best known as a once-thriving online marketplace for drug transactions.
Ulbricht was sentenced in 2015 after a court found that he operated Silk Road under the pseudonym “Dread Pirate Roberts.” Among other lines of defense, Ulbricht’s legal team argued that IP addresses central to the case were gathered without a warrant and violated his Fourth Amendment rights, though the appeals court ultimately did not rule in his favor.
Ulbricht’s particularly harsh sentence for nonviolent crimes is largely due to the massive scale at which the Silk Road facilitated the drug trade. His charges included money laundering, conspiracy to traffic narcotics and a “kingpin” charge generally withheld for leaders of major drug cartels.

Mary Meeker’s latest Internet Trends Report, out today, was full of insights on how tech is shaping our future — including now in healthcare. This was the first year Meeker included healthcare in her report and it shows just how much of a role tech is going to play in improving our lives going forward.
A few key insights from the report:

Wearable devices have continued to gain momentum with 25 percent of Americans now owning one (up 12 percent from 2016). The most popular of these are devices tracking our speed, followed by heart rate.
More of us are now downloading health apps and willing to share our health data, too.
Meeker’s report says a full 60 percent of us were willing to share our health data with Google in 2016.
Consumers also have more access to commercially available lab tests than ever before.
In other good news, hospitals and doctor’s offices now offer patients access to their own digital data, as well.
All that data has now helped medical knowledge double every 3.5 years (as opposed to doubling every 50 years like it did in 1950).
Larger amounts of available health data is possibly helping to accelerate clinical trials and encouraging collaboration within the scientific community, too.

Much of these insights aren’t all that surprising. Wearables are ubiquitous, there’s money to be made in disrupting old systems by making them digital and venture firms have poured a bunch of money into new health startups to do just that. According to Rock Health, financing in the space rose to $4.2 billion in 2016 and VCs are now reportedly “tripping over themselves” to hire more experts in the bio field.
There are a few drawbacks, of course. Healthcare is a highly regulated area and, unlike an app, you can’t just spit something out and tweak later. As Theranos sadly learned, you have to be right about your product the first time. But it’s pretty neat to see the health field get in-depth coverage from Meeker this year. It shows the power Silicon Valley holds in shaping the way we handle our future well-being.

As rumors swirl around President Trump’s decision to remain or withdraw from international climate accords, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton had some choice words for the president from the stage of the Code Conference on Wednesday in Rancho Palos Verdes, Calif.
Echoing the sentiments of current Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and a number of executives who have signed on to an ad campaign to encourage the president to remain in the Paris Agreement, Clinton said that abandoning the agreement would be bad for the U.S. and American businesses.
“Someone will be the leader in clean energy exports,” said Clinton, who underscored China and European state support and the competitive businesses those companies have created around renewable energy.
“There’s a huge market that someone is going to own and we’re giving that up,” Clinton said.
She admonished the president by noting that there are only two countries that have not signed the Paris Agreement — Syria and Nicaragua.
Further, Clinton argued that the antipathy from the current administration toward companies tackling renewable energy and climate change were making U.S. companies less competitive in global markets.
“It’s a shame,” Clinton said, that these companies didn’t have the support of the U.S. government.

There’s always been talk about how drones could improve the emissions situation produced by our truck-based delivery infrastructure. But you have to look into these things. A new study from University of Washington researchers indicates that drone delivery may indeed lead to a lower carbon footprint — if it’s done properly.
“I was amazed at how energy-efficient drones are in some contexts,” said Anne Goodchild, who led the research, in a UW news release. “Trucks compete better on heavier loads, but for really light packages, drones are awesome.”
Her study examined the theoretical energy costs of a number of delivery scenarios in the Los Angeles area. Drones, as they are today, can only carry one item at a time, but they can fly over traffic in efficient straight lines. When was this style more efficient than a truck with dozens or hundreds of packages?
According to the researchers’ analysis, drones are more efficient for pretty much anything up to a mile away, and depending on the number of stops, considerably farther. Scenarios with lots of stops in one place, like a major office building, don’t make much sense for drones — but going a mile out of your way to deliver to a farmhouse is equally nonsensical for a heavy truck.
“You’re probably not going to see these in downtown Seattle anytime soon,” Goodchild said. “But maybe in a rural community with roads that are slow and hard for trucks to navigate and no air space or noise concerns.”
There’s much more to the question than simply which is more efficient, of course: How clean is the power used to recharge the drones? How reliable are these estimates? Is backyard delivery really what’s needed? What about electric trucks?
Good questions all! And studies addressing them will surely be conducted over the years to come. Meanwhile, this one will appear in an upcoming issue of the journal Transportation Research.

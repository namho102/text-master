Foreign purchases of U.S. residential real estate surged to the highest level ever in terms of number of homes sold and dollar volume.
Foreign buyers closed on $153 billion worth of U.S. residential properties between April 2016 and March 2017, a 49 percent jump from the period a year earlier, according to the National Association of Realtors. That surpasses the previous high, set in 2015.
The jump follows a year-earlier retreat and comes as a surprise, given the current strength of the U.S. dollar against most foreign currencies, which makes U.S. housing even more expensive. Apparently, the value of a financial safe-haven is outweighing the rising costs.
Foreign sales accounted for 10 percent of all existing home sales by dollar volume and 5 percent by number of properties. In total, foreign buyers purchased 284,455 homes, up 32 percent from the previous year.
Half of all foreign sales were in just three states: Florida, California and Texas.
Chinese buyers led the pack for the fourth straight year, followed by buyers from Canada, the United Kingdom, Mexico and India. Russian buyers made up barely 1 percent of the purchases.
Manufacturing in New York state grew for a second month in July but at a much slower pace, as new orders and shipments both slipped.
The Federal Reserve Bank of New York says its Empire State manufacturing index dropped to 9.8 from 19.8 in June. Any reading above zero signals expansion.
July's drop comes after the index reached a two-year high in June. Still, the reading is at a mostly healthy level. While the index measures sentiment among New York firms, it is closely followed by economists because it provides an early read on factory output nationwide.
A measure of new orders dropped to 13.3 from 18.1, while a gauge of shipments dropped to 10.5 from 22.3. Hiring also slowed sharply.
Stung by the public relations debacle of Republican's attempts to change health care, President Donald Trump's administration is said to be planning a more coordinated effort for its tax reform efforts, Axios reported on Sunday.
Citing sources familiar with the matter, the publication said the White House has engaged in high-level planning and organization of its efforts to reshape the tax code — the centerpiece of Trump's economic policy and a linchpin of the rally that's carried the market to new record highs.
Axios cited unnamed activists and business leaders that have met with National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Press Secretary Sean Spicer, who is leading the communications strategy. Those involved in the effort said the administration is hoping to avoid tax reform meeting the same fate as the GOP's health care reform, currently mired in the Senate, where passage is uncertain.
Dallas Federal Reserve Bank President Robert Kaplan said on Friday that the U.S. central bank could begin to allow its $4.5 trillion balance sheet to shrink "as soon as September."
At the same time, he reiterated his view that while the U.S. is near full employment, inflation has been muted, and he would like to see more progress before raising U.S. interest rates further.
U.S. business inventories rebounded in May as sales recorded their biggest drop in 10 months, government data showed on Friday.
The Commerce Department said business inventories increased 0.3 percent after an unrevised 0.2 percent decrease in April. Sales fell 0.2 percent, the biggest decline since July 2016, after being unchanged in April.
Inventories are a key component of gross domestic product. At May's sales pace, it would take 1.38 months for businesses to clear shelves, up from 1.37 months in April.

Confidence in future economic prospects continued slipping into early July, the University of Michigan reported Friday.
U.S. consumer sentiment fell to 93.1 in a preliminary survey. Economists expected consumer sentiment to hit 95 in July, according to Thomson Reuters consensus estimates.
"Overall, the recent data follow the same pattern repeatedly recorded around past cyclical peaks: expectations start to post significant declines while assessments of current economic conditions continue to reach new peaks," Richard Curtin, a chief economist for the University of Michigan's survey of consumers, said in a statement.
"To be sure, the data do not suggest an impending recession. ... Much steeper declines in expectations typically precede recessions."
U.S. consumer sentiment last fell to 95.1 in June, sinking 2.1 percent from May.
The declines being recorded by the group are "now consistent with just above 2% GDP growth in 2017," Curtin said. "[T]he data indicate that hopes for a prolonged period of 3% GDP growth sparked by Trump's victory have largely vanished..."
In a preliminary July survey, a reading of current U.S. economic conditions is at 113.2, and an index of consumer expectations sits at 80.2, the University of Michigan said.
Notably, consumers' assessments of current economic conditions hit the highest level since a July 2005 survey.
The monthly survey by the University of Michigan measures 500 consumers' attitudes toward topics such as personal finances, inflation, unemployment, government policies and interest rates.
The University of Michigan's next data release is scheduled for July 28 at 10 am ET.

Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney on Friday defended the Trump administration's position that getting rid of Obamacare will have a positive impact on GDP.
There are some people in Washington who are invested in the United States not achieving 3 percent growth, Mulvaney told CNBC's "Squawk Box."
"Because if we do, it's going to make the previous administration look bad and have long-term political ramifications," Mulvaney said.
He added there's a "disincentive" for Americans to work buried in Obamacare.
Mulvaney wrote an op-ed published Thursday in The Wall Street Journal on how the Trump administration can achieve that growth. He dubbed it "MAGAnomics," a mashup of President Donald Trump's slogan "Make America Great Again" and the word economics.
Before the Senate Banking Committee on Thursday, Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen said she doesn't believe Trump's plan will be enough to get 3 percent.
Productivity growth is hard to move, and labor force growth is on the decline, Yellen said.
Senate Republicans unveiled a revised version of their legislation to repeal and replace Obamacare on Thursday. The House passed a health-care overhaul bill in May.
A vote on a motion to proceed with the Senate Republicans' bill is expected to be held next week. That would allow amendments to be offered for the bill and put it on track to a final vote. Mulvaney says he thinks the bill will pass.
JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon expressed frustration at the U.S. federal government during the company's earnings conference call Friday.
"It's almost an embarrassment being an American citizen traveling around the world and listening to the stupid s--- we have to deal with in this country," Dimon said in response to an analyst question.
"Since the Great Recession, which is now 8 years old, we've been growing at 1.5 to 2 percent in spite of stupidity and political gridlock, because the American business sector is powerful and strong," he said. "What I'm saying is it would be much stronger growth had we made intelligent decisions and were there not gridlock."
The executive of the U.S. banking giant cited travels to countries such as France, Argentina, Israel and Ireland. The U.S. has become "one of the most bureaucratic, confusing, litigious societies on the planet" and "it's hurting the average American that we don't have these right policies," he said.
Earlier Friday, JPMorgan Chase reported earnings that handily beat Wall Street estimates. However, the bank lowered its forecast for lending revenue.
Dimon also blasted the press in a separate conference call Friday for focusing on the bank's quarterly results and missing the bigger picture.
Shares briefly fell more than 1.5 percent.
Despite the Republican majority in Congress, Washington has been caught in gridlock over a new health care bill, which is seen as a precursor to passing new legislation on tax reform. The Senate this week cut short its August recess by two weeks in order to deal with the debate.
In response to a separate question, Dimon said government regulation on banks was preventing economic growth, by keeping certain home buyers and small startups from getting funding.
"The counterfactual would have been that a trillion dollars or 2 trillion would have been lent out had these rules been changed five years ago," he said. "There's a false notion that all this stuff didn't hold back the economy. Yes, it did."
Here's most of the full rant:
Since the Great Recession, which is now 8 years old, we've been growing at 1.5 to 2 percent in spite of stupidity and political gridlock. Because the American business sector is powerful and strong, and is going to grow regardless of — people wake up in the morning, they want to feed their kids, they want to buy a home, they want to do things, the same with American businesses — what I'm saying is it would be much stronger growth had we made intelligent decisions and were there not gridlock.
And thank you for pointing it out because I'm going to be a broken record until this gets done. We are unable to build bridges, we're unable to build airports, our inner city school kids are not graduating.
I was just in France, I was recently in Argentina, I was in Israel, I was in Ireland. We met with the prime minister of India and China. It's amazing to me that every single one of those countries understands that practical policies to promote business and growth is good for the average citizens of those countries, for jobs and wages, and that somehow this great American free enterprise system, we no longer get it.
Corporate taxation is critical to that, by the way. We've been driving capital earnings overseas, which is why there's $2 trillion overseas benefiting all these other countries and stuff like that. So if we don't get our act together — we can still grow.
It's unfortunate, but it's hurting us, it's hurting the body politic, it's hurting the average American that we don't have these right policies. So no, in spite of gridlock we'll grow at maybe 1.5 or 2 percent.
I don't buy the argument that we're relegated to this forever. We're not. If this administration can make breakthroughs in taxes and infrastructure, regulatory reform —we have become one of the most bureaucratic, confusing, litigious societies on the planet.
It's almost an embarrassment being an American citizen traveling around the world and listening to the stupid s--- we have to deal with in this country. And at one point we all have to get our act together or we won't do what we're supposed to [do] for the average Americans.
And unfortunately people write about this saying like it's for corporations. It's not for corporations. Competitive taxes are important for business and business growth, which is important for jobs and wage growth. And honestly we should be ringing that alarm bell, every single one of you, every time you talk to a client.
U.S. retail sales unexpectedly fell in June for a second straight month, which could temper expectations of strong acceleration in economic growth in the second quarter.
The Commerce Department said on Friday retail sales fell 0.2 percent last month, weighed down by declines in receipts at service stations, clothing stores and supermarkets. Americans also cut back on spending at restaurants and bars, as well as on hobbies.
May's retail sales were revised to show a 0.1 percent dip instead of the previously reported 0.3 percent drop. Retail sales rose 2.8 percent year-on-year in June.
Excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, retail sales slipped 0.1 percent last month after being unchanged in May. These so-called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of grossdomestic product.
U.S. industrial production rose for a fifth straight month in June, helped by gains in mining, while the manufacturing sector rebounded.
Overall industrial production rose 0.4 percent in June after being up a revised 0.1 percent in May. Mining output increased 1.6 percent, with advances in oil and gas extraction, in coal mining and in drilling and support activities. Utilities output was unchanged.
Economists had expected industrial output to increase 0.3 percent from the previously reported flat reading in May.
Manufacturing rebounded 0.2 percent, in line with economist expectations, after an unrevised 0.4 percent fall in May. Activity in the manufacturing sector, which makes up about 12 percent of the U.S. economy, has been slowing amid a moderation in oil prices and declining motor vehicle sales.
Capacity utilization, which measures how fully companies are deploying their resources, rose to 76.6 percent in June from 76.4 percent in May. Economists had forecast a 76.7 percent rate in June.
The U.S. Consumer Price Index was forecast to rise 0.2 percent in June, after edging up 0.1 percent a month earlier.
U.S. consumer prices were unchanged in June as the cost of gasoline and mobile phone services declined further, pointing to benign inflation that could cast doubts on the Federal Reserve's ability to increase interest rates for a third time this year.
The Labor Department said on Friday that the unchanged reading in its Consumer Price Index followed a 0.1 percent dip in May. The lack of a rebound in the CPI in June could trouble Fed officials who have largely viewed the recent moderation in price pressures as transitory.
In the 12 months through June, the CPI increased 1.6 percent - the smallest gain since October 2016 - after rising 1.9 percent in May. The year-on-year CPI has been softening steadily since February, when it hit 2.7 percent.
Fed Chair Janet Yellen, in testimony Thursday before Congress, walked back comments she made recently that there would not be another financial crisis "in our lifetime."
Instead, the central bank chief said banking regulations have made another crisis significantly less likely and the financial system has enough capital on hand to withstand a downturn.
"What I should have stated originally when I made that comment, I believe we have done a great deal since the financial crisis to strengthen the system and to make it more resilient," she said in her semiannual remarks to the Senate Banking Committee.
"I think that we can never be confident that there won't be another financial crisis. But we have acted in the aftermath of that crisis to put in place much stronger capital and liquidity requirements for systemic banking organizations and the banking system more generally," she added.
Yellen raised eyebrows during a June 27 appearance in London when she said the Fed's actions in the wake of the financial crisis had brought a stability to the system that is unlikely to be broken soon. Her assertion that another crisis was unlikely drew some derision on Wall Street and on social media.
During her Senate remarks, Yellen was questioned about the statement and quickly moved to clarify her meaning.
She said the Fed's moves have been critical to requiring that banks carry more capital and pass exams aimed at seeing how they would function in the event of another crisis.
"I think our stress testing regime is forcing banks to greatly improve their risk management and capital planning," Yellen said. "It's given us assurance that even if there is this very significant downturn in the economy, that they will be able to function and provide for the credit needs of the economy."
"But let me say," she added, "we can never be confident that there won't be another financial crisis. But it is important we maintain the improvements that have been put in place that mitigate the risk in the potential downturn."
It's time to make America's economy great again.
At least, that is what Office of Management and Budget director Mick Mulvaney wrote in a Wall Street Journal op-ed published Thursday.
The economic agenda, which Mulvaney dubs "MAGAnomics," is an effort to get the growth of the U.S. gross domestic product back to 3 percent. It is a feat that many economists have called "unrealistic," he said.
"That's fine with us," Mulvaney wrote. "We heard the same pessimism 40 years ago, when the country was mired in 'stagflation' and 'malaise.' But Ronald Reagan dared to challenge that thinking and steered us to a boom that many people thought unachievable."
By cutting taxes, reforming welfare programs, investing in infrastructure, initiating new trade deals and curbing government spending, among other things, Mulvaney said America can achieve economic growth.
"If we enact the president's broad agenda — if MAGAnomics is allowed to work — we will have set the stage for the greatest revival of the American economy since the early 1980s," he wrote.

A growing group of states across the nation are offering to pay the tuition costs for college students. In April, New York became the first state in the United States to offer its residents tuition-free attendance at public four-year colleges and universities and community college when the state legislature approved the Excelsior Scholarship program. In May, Tennessee lawmakers gave final approval to Tennessee Reconnect, making community college across the state tuition-free for adults over 24 — as it has been for high school graduates in state since 2014.
California could be the next to join the ranks: In April state lawmakers introduced the Degrees Not Debt scholarship. A $1.5 billion program to be phased in over five years, Degrees Not Debt would make money available to University of California and Cal State University undergraduates who already qualify for need-based aid but struggle paying non-tuition expenses, such as books, transportation and housing. The projected impact in the state, where roughly half of students graduate with student loan debt, was 392,000 students.
According to new research by Harvard University, almost 40 million Americans "live in housing they cannot afford." Homeownership has gone down and rental prices keep going up, meaning that millions of residents are forced to pay more than they reasonably should.
In the study, the researchers determined affordability by people's ability to pay 30 percent of their income or less on the cost of housing, which may include their mortgage, insurance and taxes.
Homeownership keeps declining, according to the Joint Center for Housing Studies' detailed and comprehensive 2017 State of the Nation's Housing report, in part because homes prices in many markets have continued to go up while wages have not kept pace. In 2016, "the homeownership rate fell to 63.4 percent, marking the 12th consecutive year of declines."
A lot of people who would like to buy are stuck renting, Harvard reports: "The surge in rental demand that began in 2005 is broad-based — including several types of households that traditionally prefer homeownership."
Wanted: a seasoned executive to take the top position at a troubled technology start-up. Must be willing to fix a broken culture, deal with an aggressive predecessor, battle a risky lawsuit and prepare the company for an initial public offering. Self-starters preferred.
This is essentially the pitch that Uber is making to potential chief executive candidates after Travis Kalanick, the ride-hailing company's co-founder, was ousted from the top spot last month. By some accounts, the job appears to be a thankless one at a company whose reputation is in the toilet. So who would want it?
Quite a few people, as it turns out.

Despite a series of scandals that have rocked Uber to its core this year, competition for the chief executive position is robust, according to people familiar with the search who asked to remain anonymous because the process is confidential. The company has received a flood of interest since Mr. Kalanick vacated his seat in June, and Uber's board has interviewed multiple candidates.
For those applicants, the calculus is easy. Despite Uber's problems, executives see an opportunity to shepherd the company — which operates in more than 80 countries and pulls in billions of dollars each quarter — through the most trying time in its eight-year history.
"This is a fantastic opportunity for someone who's wired for problem solving and wants to make their mark by turning around the image of the company," said Jason Hanold, managing partner at Hanold Associates, a boutique executive search firm. "Yes, they're inheriting Uber's entire toxic culture. But they're also getting thousands of employees who are hungry to change it."
The chance of having an impact is high. Apart from the opportunity to steer a turnaround, any chief executive would be walking into a company that has already reached enormous scale. As a result, changes made by a new chief would affect millions of people globally, not to mention Uber's work force of more than 15,000 employees and hundreds of thousands of contract drivers.
The eventual chief executive would also have the opportunity to take Uber public. The company, which began in 2009, is now the highest-valued private company in the world, with a valuation of around $70 billion. And while Uber is unprofitable, its revenue has been growing. That would make an initial public offering a huge event on Wall Street, as well as for Silicon Valley investors who have billions of dollars wagered on Uber's success.
For now, Uber's executive search committee, which includes five members of its board, has kept the lid tight on the list of candidates. After a torrent of leaks before Mr. Kalanick's departure, two of the people familiar with the search said there has been a renewed effort to keep quiet.
Among those up for consideration have been Susan Wojcicki, who leads YouTube. Others include Adam Bain, Twitter's former chief operating officer; David Cush, a former chief executive at Virgin America; the former Yahoo chief executive Marissa Mayer; and Thomas Staggs, a former chief operating officer at Disney, according to three other people familiar with the search. It was unclear what level of interest, if any, these executives had expressed in the Uber job.
Others, like the former Google sales executive Nikesh Arora, have been quietly advancing themselves for the position, according to two of the people.
Mr. Bain, Mr. Cush, Ms. Mayer, Mr. Staggs and Mr. Arora did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A YouTube spokesman declined to comment about Ms. Wojcicki.
Some candidates have expressed concern over how Uber's board operates, especially because Mr. Kalanick retains a seat. Mr. Kalanick, who remains a significant Uber shareholder, has been active in the search for his replacement, according to two of the people familiar with the candidates, although the candidates have been assured that they would have autonomy as chief executive.
Uber has other considerations in choosing a new leader. The company has faced intense criticism for its lack of diversity and has only recently begun to address the matter. Last year, Arianna Huffington, the media entrepreneur who runs the health and wellness business Thrive Global, joined Uber's board, and in the past few months the company has recruited female and minority executives.
For the eventual winning candidate, there will be plenty of difficulties. Negative perception of Uber tripled, to 27 percent of respondents, in a survey conducted in May by cg42, a management consulting firm. The company has had a more difficult time hiring technical talent in light of its negative image.
Uber also faces a lawsuit filed by Waymo, the self-driving car company spun out of Google, over claims of stolen trade secrets. And Uber is in the midst of reforming its fractured culture after a former employee spoke publicly about sexual harassment at the company.
While the job will make Uber's next chief executive wealthy, it will not necessarily make him filthy rich: With the company's valuation already so high, any stock doled out to a new chief would most likely have to experience an enormous rise in value after a public offering for the returns to be considerable.
Yet the positives of the job still outweigh the negatives for hopeful applicants.
"Even with all the problems that companies like Uber have, there will always be top candidates who want to go there," Mr. Hanold said. "These people are problem solvers: The hairier a scenario is, the more they're attracted to trying to fix it."

"The Board believes that separating the roles of Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board is the most appropriate structure at this time," according to the filing. "Having an independent Chairman of the Board is a means to ensure that Mr. Munoz is able to more exclusively focus on his role as Chief Executive Officer."
The company also revealed Friday that a new 2017 compensation program for Munoz, along with that of other executives, will be more closely tied to improved customer satisfaction. United said it wants "directly and meaningfully progress in improving the customer experience."

As part of Friday's disclosure, United also released its annual compensation figures for its top executives. Munoz received a total of $18.7 million, including $6.8 million related to replacing his equity stake that he held when he was president of railway CSX.
United declined to comment.
The changes come on the heels of a public relations disaster in which a passenger was dragged, bloodied and screaming, off an aircraft after he refused to give up his seat for commuting crew members.
The company's first response, attributed to Munoz, did not go over well. He issued a statement that apologized only for "having to re-accommodate ... customers."
A second statement called the victim, Dr. David Dao "disruptive and belligerent." And finally a third statement from Munoz reversed course, decrying the situation and calling it a "truly horrific event," and offered a direct apology to Dao.
Dao's lawyers have said he plans to file a lawsuit.
Munoz took the top spot at United in 2015 during trying times for the company. He was hired as CEO from outside the company after its former chief, Jeff Smisek, was forced to resign due to a scandal involving the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.
Shortly after he took the reins, Munoz suffered a heart attack and underwent a heart transplant, which kept him out of the office for two months.
Robert Milton has been chairman since 2016, and will remain in that position.
In a statement, Exxon said "we understand" the decision by the Treasury Department. Exxon explained that its application for a license was aimed at meeting the company's "contractual obligations" in Russia, where competitors are allowed to drill under European sanctions.
There are powerful reasons why Exxon would want to get back into business with Rosneft: Their agreement to form a joint venture, signed in 2011, allowed Exxon to conduct offshore exploration in the Black Sea and the Kara Sea in Siberia.
The undeveloped oil fields are thought to be the most promising in the Russian Arctic, according to S&P Global Platts.
In 2012, the two firms agreed to jointly develop more oil reserves in Siberia and establish a research center in the Arctic.
Plans to build a large natural gas plant near Vladivostock in eastern Russia followed in 2013.
The deepening relationship was put on hold, however, after the United States, European Union and other Western countries imposed sanctions on Russia in 2014 over its role in the crisis in Ukraine.
Exxon, which has been operating in Russia for more than 20 years, was allowed to finish some of its projects. But then the drilling stopped.
A lot has changed since then. The Russian economy has turned the corner, emerging from a painful recession in the final quarter of 2016.
Oil prices have climbed back above $50 per barrel.

The Trump administration is under intense scrutiny over its ties to Moscow. The fact that the current secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, spearheaded the Rosneft deal while CEO of Exxon, has drawn even more attention to the waiver request.
Tillerson has recused himself from all government matters involving Exxon. He also sold all his stock in the firm, and is placing the shares he would have received over the next decade into an independently managed trust.
But a political storm started brewing earlier this week when the Wall Street Journal first reported that Exxon was seeking a waiver.
Sen. John McCain, a Republican, asked "Are they crazy?" when news of the waiver application broke. McCain is a leading critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Are they crazy? @WSJ: "Exxon Seeks U.S. Waiver to Resume #Russia Oil Venture" https://t.co/CHKS3sjOa8

Rep. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intel Committee, said that the waiver should be denied.
"The Treasury Department should reject any waiver from sanctions which would allow Exxon Mobile or any other company to resume business with prohibited Russian entities," he said in a statement.
"I was very surprised Exxon did this because it would be bad publicity. The secretary of state was only on the job for two months and they already tried to get behind the sanctions," said Fadel Gheit, managing director of Oppenheimer & Co.'s oil and gas research division.
Still, the financial incentives for Exxon are powerful when it comes to Russia.
"Exxon is a big company. It's very hard for anything to move the needle," said Brian Youngberg, senior energy analyst at Edward Jones. "Russia could potentially be that, years out. It potentially could be very lucrative."
In March 2016, Tillerson said that Exxon was "very anxious to get back to work there."
His successor echoed that hope earlier this year.
"In Russia, we're there for the long term," CEO Darren Woods said in a February interview with Forbes.

The stock was the worst performer in the S&P 500 on Friday.
CEO Margo Georgiadis, who left her job as president of Google's Americas division in January to take over at Mattel, said in the earnings release that the results were worse than expected due to "the retail inventory overhang" after the holidays.
In other words, parents didn't buy their kids more new toys after splurging on them in December. But Mattel has been struggling for some time now.
That's one of the reasons that Georgiadis succeeded Christopher Sinclair as CEO, in the first place. (Sinclair is now executive chairman.)
Related: It was a Blue Christmas for Mattel
Simply put, Mattel doesn't have the toys that kids want. Barbie sales plunged 13%. American Girl sales were down 12%. And the company's Construction and Arts & Crafts unit, which includes Lego competitor Mega Bloks, plummeted 38%.
And it's not just a matter of children abandoning traditional dolls, action figures and board games in favor of smartphones, tablets, video games and other technology.
Mattel rival Hasbro (HAS), which has licenses tied to Disney's (DIS) Star Wars franchise, and also recently took over the Disney Princess line of toys from Mattel, has been on fire lately.
Shares of Hasbro are up nearly 25% so far in 2017 and more than 75% over the past three years. Mattel's stock has plunged nearly 20% already in 2017 and is down more than 40% since early 2014.
Hasbro's stock even rose slightly Friday, a sign Wall Street believes Mattel's problems are company specific and not a broader indicator of weak consumer spending overall.
Related: Let it go? No way! Hasbro soars thanks to Frozen
Hasbro will report its latest results before the market opens Monday. Wall Street is expecting that sales and earnings were flat in the first quarter, which is typically not a big one for toy companies.
So will Georgiadis, who in addition to Google has also worked for Groupon (GRPN), credit card company Discover (DFS) and consulting company McKinsey & Company, be able to turn Mattel around? She is a veteran exec, but lacks toy industry experience.
She noted in the earnings release that sales in China and other parts of Asia were strong. She also expressed hope that toys tied to another upcoming Disney movie -- Pixar's Cars 3 -- will help boost sales in the coming quarters for its Hot Wheels brand.
But the pressure is on Georgiadis to quickly prove to kids, parents and investors that Mattel will be able to revitalize some of its classic brands like Barbie and Fisher-Price and also launch new hit toys as well.
Otherwise, the stock will continue to languish in Wall Street's equivalent of the Island of Misfit Toys.
Citigroup analysts have described it as a "nightmare scenario" for investors.
Le Pen wants to take France out of the euro and hold a referendum on the country's membership in the European Union. She is also opposed to new free trade deals.
Melenchon, who has been endorsed by the French Communist Party, has also threatened to drop the common currency unless Europe agrees key demands. He also wants to take France out of NATO, bring energy companies under state control and substantially raise taxes on the rich.
"A Le Pen vs. Melenchon final would likely have far-reaching consequences for the country, as well as Europe at large," wrote analysts at Citigroup.
Related: Why many Europeans want their money back
Investors are most worried about the euro. The currency, used by 19 EU countries, is the most visible symbol of the region's experiment with economic integration since the end of World War II.
France has long been a pillar of support for the currency, and the euro's continued survival would be in doubt if France were to abandon it.
Diego Iscaro, an economist at IHS Markit, said that the impact of such a scenario on the French and European economies "would be difficult to overestimate."

Stock markets have so far mostly remained calm in the face of this existential risk. But there are signs of rising anxiety: The difference in yields on French and German government bonds has widened in recent weeks, suggesting that investors see French debt as an increasingly risky bet.
Still, a runoff between Le Pen and Melenchon is far from guaranteed.
The centrist candidate Emmanuel Macron still sits atop most polls, and the conservative Francois Fillon remains within striking distance. Both back the euro.
There are also structural factors that would restrain a President Le Pen or a President Melenchon.
In France, the heavy lifting in government is done by the prime minister. And the prime minister comes from the party that holds the majority in parliament. No matter who's president, they won't be able to move controversial proposals through the government if their party lacks support in the parliament.
But GM isn't changing tack. The automaker told CNNMoney Friday it stands by its statement on Wednesday, saying Venezuelan authorities had seized its car assembly plant in the country.
GM (GM) shut down operations there because of the alleged illegal seizure, putting 2,678 workers out of work.
Venezuela said it took the action to resolve a long-running dispute involving GM going back to 2000. But officials want the plant to continue production while GM's assets in Venezuela are frozen.
What's unclear is how the plant could forge ahead with production given that GM says it has ceased operations.
Related: Venezuela's latest corporate target: Spain's Telefonica
The back and forth comes as Venezuela is investigating another foreign firm, phone service provider Movistar, a subsidiary of Spain's Telefonica. Authorities claim Movistar is supporting opposition leaders protesting against President Nicolas Maduro.
Both Movistar and Telefonica haven't responded to requests for comment. Movistar has 11 million customers Venezuela -- about one-third of the population.
GM and Movistar join a long list of international companies that have been under siege in Venezuela, either from political pressure, unpaid bills or, in most cases, economic stress due to the country's plunging currency.
The verbal clashes with corporations also come as violent protests continue this week. Three people were killed Wednesday as police quelled protests with tear gas and gun shots. Another mega march is scheduled for Saturday. Protestors want a change of government after the population suffers through food and medical shortages.

The new timeline reflects the reality that the scandal took place earlier than previously thought. Wells Fargo's own board of directors put out a 110-page report on April 10 that found evidence of "mass terminations" of employees for opening unauthorized accounts and other misconduct going back to "at least 2002."
"We made a number of mistakes, there's no question about it. We're focused on fixing what was broken, making sure that we're making things right by our customers," Wells Fargo CEO Tim Sloan told CNN's Poppy Harlow in an exclusive interview this week.
Wells Fargo said the revised settlement, which is subject to court approval, will cover "all customers" claiming that without their consent the bank opened an account in their name, enrolled them in a product or service or submitted credit card or other applications.
Related: Wells Fargo CEO: We're America's 'best corporate citizen'
Once preliminary approval is received for the settlement, Wells Fargo said a notice will be sent to customers explaining the process to make claims.
It's not clear how much each customer will receive because it's too early to know how many people will be included in the settlement.
After subtracting attorneys' fees and costs of administration, Wells Fargo said the $142 million will go towards reimbursing customers for fees and damage to their credit scores. The remainder of the pool will be for "additional compensation," the bank said.
Lawyers representing the plaintiffs said in a separate statement that the additional compensation will be "based on the number of unauthorized accounts, products or services opened in their names."
The class action payouts would be on top of the $3.2 million in refunds that Wells Fargo paid to customers to cover 130,000 potentially-unauthorized accounts Those refunds work out to about $25 per account.

Wells Fargo was at the center of a national firestorm last September when regulators slapped the bank with $185 million in fines for creating some two million unauthorized accounts. The bank said it fired 5,300 workers since 2011 for improper sales tactics.
Wells Fargo has since taken numerous steps aimed at fixing its culture, including eliminating unrealistic sales goals, changing its leadership and clawing back $180 million in pay from senior executives.
The settlement with regulators was based on a review of accounts going back to 2011. Under pressure from the public, Wells Fargo agreed to expand the account review to include 2009 and 2010.
However, Wells Fargo does not plan to review accounts back to 2002, despite the findings of the independent board report finding evidence of "mass terminations" of employees for opening unauthorized accounts and other misconduct. Sloan told CNN that's because there are "challenges" with the "quality of the data" from that long ago. He urged customers who have concerns to reach out to Wells Fargo.
"We've done everything we can to turn over every stone," Sloan said.
The 28-year old -- a German-Russian citizen police identified as Sergej W. -- bought more than 15,000 options on Borussia Dortmund shares, according to prosecutors. The options gave him the right to sell the shares at a set price in the future.
Prosecutors said he stood to make a profit of "multiples" of his original stake if the stock price had collapsed.
That did not happen. Shares in the team's holding company were worth €5.61 euro each on the day of the attack. They fell a little early the next day but closed nearly 2% higher at €5.71 on the Frankfurt stock exchange.
Marcus Silbe, a stock market analyst at Oddo Seydler Bank in Frankfurt, said the alleged attacker appeared to have little knowledge of finance, and would have gained several hundreds of thousands of euros at most.
Borussia Dortmund stock has since returned to the levels it was trading at before the bomb attack.
But the injured player -- Marc Bartra -- and the soccer club will likely need much longer to fully recover.
The team was heading to a European Champions League game against Monaco when the explosion happened. The match was postponed by 24 hours and ended in Borussia Dortmund's first home defeat in 21 matches.
The 1997 European champions and eight times German champions lost to Monaco again on Wednesday, meaning the team crashed out of the lucrative European Champions League. That sent shares tumbling 3.4%.
"What we will never know is if Borussia Dortmund [would have] succeeded against Monaco without this attack," Silbe said.

The prosecutors said the suspect bought most of the options online from his hotel on the day of the attack. It was the same hotel used by the soccer team.

The three explosive devices shattered windows and injured Bartra. The Spanish player suffered injuries to his arm and hand, and underwent an operation.
The suspect has been charged with attempted murder, causing an explosion and aggravated battery and severe bodily harm.
The changes quickly paid off, with McDonald's reporting solid sales gains for much of 2015 and 2016.
Sales have started to cool off a bit in the U.S. recently though, but investors don't seem that alarmed. McDonald's will report its latest results on Tuesday.
The company's sales are still sizzling in many overseas markets. And all the talk about mobile ordering has analysts excited.
McDonald's USA president Chris Kempczinski told investors in March that the company planned to have mobile ordering and curbside pick-up options available in all of its U.S. restaurants by the fourth quarter.
The company is also testing a delivery service in Florida markets via mobile ordering with UberEats -- the ridesharing giant's GrubHub/Seamless (GRUB) competitor.
Related: McDonald's to launch ordering app and expand delivery
Two analysts upgraded McDonald's stock this week, largely due to rising expectations about the company's mobile push. Several other analysts raised their price targets on the stock as well.
Jeffrey Farmer of Wells Fargo Securities lifted his rating on McDonald's to an "outperform" -- essentially a buy -- because he thinks McDonald's has a leg up on its burger rivals in mobile.
"Restaurant consumers are aggressively gravitating toward concepts that offer the greatest level of convenience and control across ordering, payment and distribution," he wrote.
Farmer added that McDonald's is likely to get its digital payment tech out before competitors like Restaurant Brands (QSR)-owned Burger King, Wendy's (WEN) and Jack in the Box (JACK).
Bernstein's Sara Senatore -- who also boosted her rating on McDonald's to an "outperform" -- said that it was smart for McDonald's to embrace mobile ordering, just as other restaurant chains like Panera (PNRA), Domino's (DPZ) and Starbucks (SBUX) have.
Senatore did note that Starbucks has had some problems dealing with higher demand for beverages from consumers using the mobile app.
Starbucks even said in its last earnings report that long lines for drinks were scaring off customers who hadn't placed orders in advance. But Senatore argued that's a good problem to have -- and McDonald's can learn from Starbucks' growing pains.
She added that digital ordering will also help McDonald's because it "allows for greater customization while improving order accuracy and enhancing the customer experience."
Related: McDonald's just tweaked the Big Mac
Another analyst, Instinet's Mark Kalinowski, thinks that mobile could be a big win for McDonald's as well. Kalinowski surveys McDonald's franchisees as part of his research and found that many are excited about joining the mobile revolution.
"There's no doubt we need to be part of the smartphone generation," said one franchisee that Kalinowski surveyed.
Another said that "younger customers avoid quick-service restaurants due to lack of technology and they don't like dealing with people so the app will help."
So McDonald's clearly has a lot riding on the launch of its mobile ordering app. If technology winds up being the company's new "special sauce," then Big Mac lovers -- and investors -- may continue to flock to the Golden Arches.
The company had hinted that something like this could happen. Bebe said in an SEC filing last month that it was "exploring strategic alternatives." Earlier this month, the company said it planned to close 28 stores and was trying to figure out what to do with the rest of them.
Related: Walmart CEO saw his pay jump 13% last year
Before that announcement, Bebe had 168 stores in the United States and Canada.
Bebe has plenty of company in the struggling brick-and-mortar retail industry. Macy's (M), JCPenney (JCP) and Sears (SHLD) once ruled the shopping malls, but now they're closing hundreds of stores and cutting thousands of jobs.

Luxury retailer Neiman Marcus said earlier this month that it might sell itself, after ditching its plans for an IPO in January amid sorry sales.
So who's the winner? Amazon (AMZN, Tech30), the behemoth of online retail, is seizing market share from more traditional retailers, though bargain-hunters are keeping T.J. Maxx and Dollar General (DG) in business.
And Venezuela has a lot of bills to pay soon. It owes $6 billion in debt payments for the rest of this year. There's also no sign that the country's lone source of revenue -- oil exports -- will be able to pay down those debts.
At the end of the day, Venezuela is running the risk of defaulting on its debt this year, meaning it wouldn't be able to get more loans to pay for basics like food and medicine, which are in scarce supply.
Related: Venezuela's latest corporate target: Spain's Telefonica
In 2011, Venezuela had $30 billion in the bank. As recently as 2015, it had $20 billion.
The worsening financial picture underscores Venezuela's problems. Violent, anti-government protests killed three people Wednesday, and more protests are scheduled for the weekend. Armed forces met protesters with tear gas and shots.
Also on Wednesday, General Motors (GM) said Venezuelan authorities seized its assembly plant. Authorities later denied it was seized, saying it's embargoed until a long-running court case is resolved, but that distinction didn't matter to GM: it shut down operations due to the government intervention.
The IMF predicted on Tuesday that inflation in Venezuela would skyrocket 720% while unemployment would shoot up over 25%. This year will likely mark the fourth straight year of recession -- entirely under socialist president Nicolas Maduro, who blames the U.S. and political opponents for the country's problems.
Related: Venezuela donated $500k to Trump's inauguration
But many are questioning the priorities of the government. Filings showed Venezuela -- unable to pay for imports of food for its millions of starving citizens -- donated $500,000 to President Trump's inauguration committee.
To make debt payments last year, the Venezuelan government started shipping some of its gold to Switzerland to either serve as collateral for a loan or a cash-for-gold exchange.
So far, Venezuela has paid its creditors instead of paying for basic imports of food and medicine for its struggling citizens.
Wells Fargo (WFC) recently announced that it donated $281 million to 14,900 nonprofits in 2016, part of its effort to "make every community in which we live and do business better." It ranked No. 3 among all American companies and first among financial services on cash donations in 2015, according to a survey by the Chronicle of Philanthropy.
By many other measures though, Wells Fargo would not only fall far short of being called a good corporate citizen, but such a claim would raise eyebrows.
"The support of nonprofits in its served communities is admirable, but that alone would not make Wells Fargo a model corporate citizen," said William Klepper, a Columbia Business School management professor.
Wells Fargo's policies on lending to communities have been recently called into question. Just last month, a top federal banking regulator provided a list of alleged Wells Fargo misconduct over the years: a 2012 settlement for steering minority homebuyers into more expensive mortgages than white borrowers; charges it illegally repossessed vehicles owned by service members; and allegations that the bank discriminated against pregnant women.
The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency described them as an "extensive and pervasive pattern" of violations at Wells Fargo, which also included the most recent fake account scandal, where over the 5,300 workers fired over several years for creating some two million unauthorized accounts.
The regulator severely downgraded Wells Fargo's community lending rating, citing the "egregious nature" of "discriminatory and illegal" credit practices at the big bank. It was the lowest rating for the bank since the results have been publicly released in 1994.
Related: Feds knew of 700 Wells Fargo whistleblower cases in 2010
Sloan has previously said Wells Fargo is "disappointed" with the rating given the bank's "strong track record" of working with low and moderate income communities.
Others have praised Wells Fargo for such work too.
"There is no one in the country that makes more loans to people of color than Wells Fargo," said John Taylor, CEO of the National Community Reinvestment Coalition, an alliance of 600 activist groups that pushes banks to loan to underserved communities. "Without private sector capital investing in communities, those communities die."
But even Taylor said "obviously what they did was atrocious," referring to the recent scandal.
While he credited Wells Fargo's efforts to fix its culture, he added, "A good corporate citizen avoids the kinds of things that they, and the other big banks, have fallen into."
Sloan admitted to CNN that Wells Fargo "made mistakes" and pointed to the many steps the bank has made to fix things. Most notably, Wells Fargo has replaced unrealistic sales goals, changed corporate leadership, fired a handful of managers, clawed back $180 million in pay from senior executives and separated the CEO and chairman roles.
On Friday, Wells Fargo agreed to increase a preliminary class action settlement for customers hurt by the fake account scandal by $32 million. The new agreement, worth $142 million, also expanded the timeframe of the settlements of cases from 2009 to 2002.
Related: Wells Fargo CEO refuses to dig back to 2002
But Wells Fargo has not won many friends in the community with its fake account scandal. It triggered a backlash from local and federal representatives of communities. Members of Congress in September accused then-CEO John Stumpf of running "a criminal enterprise" and one lawmaker likened the bank's leadership to "the guys who ran Enron."
Local communities have sanctioned Wells Fargo over its conduct. California, the bank's home state, suspended lucrative elements of its business relationship with Wells Fargo for one year. Wells Fargo has also been sanctioned by Illinois, Ohio and more recently Seattle's city council voted in favor of cutting ties with the bank.

Wells Fargo's own board of directors put out a 110-page report last week that painstakingly detailed how the bank's flawed culture and unrealistic sales goals led to thousands of firings -- terminations that had real impacts on communities.
"Many employees felt that failing to meet sales goals could (and sometimes did) result in termination," the board report said.
Sloan did acknowledge to CNN that Wells Fargo had an incentive plan that "drove inappropriate behavior" and should have been "corrected sooner than we did."
Sloan also said Wells Fargo has hired back roughly 1,000 former employees, some of whom felt "uncomfortable" with the culture. However, he emphasized that the 5,300 fired are not welcome back because they violated Wells Fargo's code of ethics.

Also, the Trump administration is sending mixed signals about whether it will stabilize or undermine Obamacare. So far, officials have refused to promise that they will continue to pay insurers the cost-sharing subsidies that reduce out-of-pocket costs for lower-income enrollees. Many insurers want that matter settled before they commit.
President Trump has repeatedly said Obamacare is on the verge of collapse, but health policy experts dispute that. However, Obamacare may fail in certain areas next year if no insurers agree to participate.

Virginia and Kentucky are among the states with the earliest filing deadlines, and insurers won't have to submit their premiums for 2018 until later this spring. The Department of Health & Human Services pushed back the federal deadline until June 21, and many states followed suit.
Also, filing now doesn't mean insurers are definitely participating next year -- they have until September to withdraw. Several carriers have said they are still contemplating their involvement in Obamacare for 2018.
Some insurers aren't waiting around to see what happens. Humana (HUM), which was on the Kentucky exchange this year, already announced it was exiting all Obamacare exchanges in 2018 -- leaving the Knoxville, Tennessee, area with no insurers. And Aetna and Wellmark will not offer policies in Iowa next year.

Virginia's filings revealed that  UnitedHealth (UNH) will not be on the state's exchange next year. The insurance titan largely pulled out Obamacare for this year after suffering more than $1 billion in losses on Obamacare-compliant policies.
However, the other insurers currently on the market in Virginia indicated they will come back next year, including Aetna (AET), Anthem (ANTX) and Cigna (CI), though they have yet to fully commit to their involvement.
"No final decisions have been made on our 2018 on-exchange presence due to continued uncertainty and financial risk," said a spokesman for Aetna, whose CEO said in May that Obamacare was in a "death spiral."
In Kentucky, Anthem and CareSource filed to participate next year. Anthem provides coverage in every county in the Bluegrass State this year.

McMillion has led Walmart (WMT) since 2014. Under his direction, the company has expanded its e-commerce footprint and managed to stay in the game against the likes of online shopping behemoth Amazon (AMZN, Tech30).
In its most recent quarter, Walmart's online sales grew 29% from a year ago. Amazon increased total sales by 22%.
McMillon also closed a deal to buy e-commerce site Jet.com for $3.3 billion last September. And he's joined President Donald Trump's economic advisory council.
Walmart said in January it plans to create 10,000 new U.S. jobs at the top of the year. Though the additions represent less than 1% of the company's current American workforce, it runs counter to the layoffs and store shutdowns facing other retailers.
McMillon's hefty paycheck is enviable, but not unheard of.
In the same ballpark: General Motors (GM) CEO Mary Barra earned $22.6 million in 2016, up 30% if you exclude a one-time retention bonus she received the year before. Mark Fields of Ford (F) received $22.1 million in 2016, a 19% pay hike. And Randall Stephenson, the top exec at AT&T (T, Tech30), received $28.4 million, up 13%, according to a company filing.

CFPB says Ocwen also "botched basic functions like sending accurate monthly statements, properly crediting payments, and handling taxes and insurance," according to a statement.
Ocwen staunchly denied the allegation in a statement, saying the CFPB's suit "ignores critical facts and will harm consumers."
"[T]he CFPB suit is primarily based on the CFPB's flawed review of data and its self-serving conclusion about isolated instances where Ocwen self-identified ways we can do better," the company's statement reads.
Ocwen, which was founded in 1988, is one of the biggest nonbank mortgage servicers in the U.S. Its website says its customers include more than 1.3 million families across the country.
Related: House Republican: President Trump, fire CFPB Director Richard Cordray
The CFPB has been a political battleground as of late. The Trump administration and many congressional Republicans want to do away with the agency. They argue the CFPB wields too much power, due in part to the fact that it's run by a single director.
A federal judge agreed with that argument in October, but the CFPB is fighting that ruling. Another hearing is scheduled for May.
Republicans have made repeated calls for President Trump to fire Richard Cordroy, the CFPB's director. But the law that created the independent agency states the president can't fire the director without cause. The CFPB has promised a legal battle if Cordroy is booted.
Democrats have vowed to defend the bureau. They say the CFPB -- which was created in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis -- provides essential oversight on banking and helps stave off predatory lending practices.
The CFPB has levied numerous punishments against banks acting badly since the bureau was formed.
In September, the bureau pinned its largest ever fine of $100 million on Wells Fargo for secretly opening millions of unauthorized accounts in order to boost its sales figures.

Venezuela's state-run oil giant, PDVSA, bought Citgo in the 1980s. When the late President Hugo Chavez took power in 1999, Citgo was a huge money maker for the country.
Venezuela is home to the world's largest proven oil reserves, which once made PDVSA and Citgo major players in the energy world. During Chavez's presidency, he provided free heating to poor neighborhoods in New York and smaller Caribbean and Central American countries.
But with low oil prices and mismanaged resources, the company and country's debts are now piling up as Venezuela runs out of cash.
For the rest of this year, Venezuela and PDVSA collectively owe about $6 billion in debt payments. The central bank has only $10 billion in reserves, and much of it isn't even in cash but in gold bars. No wonder, the prospect of Venezuela defaulting on its debt has risen.

But like the donation to Trump, the country's leader President Nicolas Maduro's spending priorities are being called into question. So far his government has decided to pay down its debts over feeding its people.
The donation to the inauguration has also not helped Maduro earn any favors in the White House. Trump met with the wife of Maduro's jailed political opponent Leopoldo Lopez in the White House in February and tweeted that he should be freed.

This past week, the country has been racked by massive protests that were met with force by Venezuelan security forces. At least three people have been killed.

Food imports to Venezuela dropped 50% last year, according to trade statistics. Venezuelans living in extreme poverty lost an average of 21 pounds of weight last year due to lack of food, according to ENCOVI, a polling firm in Venezuela.
There are more than 40,000 Subway shops around the globe, which means it has more stores than any fast food chain on the planet.

McDonald's (MCD) has the second highest restaurant count with about 36,000 stores worldwide, though it tops Subway in sales.
Subway said Thursday its 2016 U.S. sales totaled about $11.3 billion, down from $11.5 billion in 2015.
The company said in a statement that the dip was due to a "focus on international growth," where sales were up. It's stores abroad brought in $5.8 billion, up 3.7% from the year before.
Subway also hinted that its planning a few big changes this year that aim to reinvigorate its growth stateside.

He said in a press conference that steel imports "have continued to rise, and they've continued to rise despite repeated Chinese claims that they were going to reduce their steel capacity when instead they have actually been increasing it consistently."
Ross noted that steel imports are up nearly 20% so far this year and that foreign steel now makes up more than a quarter of the entire U.S. market. He said that has had "a very serious impact" on the domestic steel industry and that it could impinge on "our economic and national defense security."
Shares of many American steel companies, including U.S. Steel (X), Nucor (NUE), Cliffs Natural Resources (CLF), AK Steel (AKS) and Steel Dynamics (STLD) all soared on the news, with some of the steel stocks climbing nearly 10%.
Related: Is Trump fixating on jobs he can't bring back?
Steel Dynamics also reported solid earnings Wednesday and Nucor issued a strong report Thursday, further helping to lift the group.
The broader market was in rally mode too, thanks in large part to comments from Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin about the possibility of a tax reform plan being announced soon. The Dow surged nearly 200 points.
Ross told reporters that no firm decisions had been made yet about what the U.S. will do to try and make American steel more competitive.
But he did not rule out the possibility of tariffs, saying that the plan likely "won't be to prohibit foreign imports, it just will be to change the price."
Any moves by the Trump administration would be another example of the president's desire to protect old school, blue collar U.S. industries, many of which have been laying off workers due to a combination of the effects of automation and globalization.
Trump has also pledged to try and help workers in hard hit sectors such as oil and coal mining.
Whether or not tariffs or other protectionist measures will actually boost any of these industries remains to be seen. But steel companies were quick to applaud the president.
U.S. Steel said in a statement that it is "pleased" that the president is launching a national security investigation into steel dumping.
"For too long, China and other nations have been conducting economic warfare against the American steel industry by subsidizing their steel industries, distorting global markets, and dumping excess steel into the United States," the company said.
U.S. Steel added that "tens of thousands of workers in the American steel industry, the industry's supply chain and the communities in which our industry operates have lost their jobs due to unfair and illegal practices by foreign producers."
And AK Steel CEO Roger Newport said in a statement that "we are hopeful that this action on behalf of our Administration will help us and other steel producers in America compete on an even playing field in all of our markets."
Newport, U.S. Steel chief Mario Longhi and several other steel CEOs met with Trump at the White House on Thursday to discuss the state of the industry and the administration's plans to crack down on steel dumping.
Trump and Ross need to tread cautiously though. If the U.S. clamps down too aggressively on Chinese steel, China could retaliate by slapping tariffs on American-made cars, electronics and other consumer goods.
China also owns more than $1 trillion worth of U.S. government bonds. China has been steadily trimming its Treasury holdings in recent months. If China ramps up the pace of its sales, that could send long-term bond yields sharply higher --something Trump would not want to see as he tries to stimulate the U.S. economy.
But Trump seems to recognize the need to be careful with China. He has already backed off his campaign pledge to label China a currency manipulator in his first few days in office for example.

"We hope that this won't take until the end of the year," said Mnuchin.
Trump's top economic adviser Gary Cohn spoke later at the event and said both men have been spending a lot of time working together on a tax proposal.
"We're going to come up with a unified, united tax proposal from the White House that will include individual as well as corporate," said Cohn, the director of the National Economic Council.
Neither senior official offered specific details of what the administration's plan might look like. Cohn said the administration's plan would be in line with campaign promises made by the president to lower rates, to simplify and to increase U.S. competitiveness.
"We've got a lot of things on the table," Cohn said. "We're working with all of the different levers."
Cohn said the administration didn't know if proposed changes would be revenue neutral yet, meaning they wouldn't add to deficits, only that the White House was seeking permanent changes to the corporate tax code. Earlier, Mnuchin suggested that a tax proposal would "pay for itself."
The administration could try to pass a bill through reconciliation, which requires 50 votes to pass in the Senate. But then any changes to the tax code would expire. "They need some permanence in the tax code," said Cohn.
Related: Trump is dialing back his economic promises. Bigly.
Mnuchin said he hoped that there would be bipartisan support for a plan. But if the administration fails to reach consensus with Democrats, they would consider working through the reconciliation process to finalize tax reform.
The treasury secretary said he has been working since "day one" with policymakers on Capitol Hill, including Senate Finance Chairman Kevin Brady and other members of the panel. He said Senate lawmakers, so far, share the same objectives, including simplifying individual taxes and making U.S. business taxes more competitive.
Also topping the administration's economic agenda: infrastructure.
The president's budget director Mick Mulvaney said Thursday the administration plans to include $200 billion for new infrastructure spending in its fiscal year 2018 budget.
"We're certainly going to spend some money," said the Office of Management Budget Director on Thursday who was also speaking at the IIF event. "The president wants a trillion dollars' worth of work on the ground and we're going to give it to him."
On the campaign trail, the president promised to spend more on improving U.S. roads, but hasn't provided any details on how he would pay for it. Mulvaney said any plan wouldn't be ready until the fall.
Analysts say the Trump administration is now dropping hints that it will reimpose sanctions unless Tehran stops what the U.S. says is destabilizing behavior in the Middle East.
"Tillerson may be suggesting that the U.S. can leverage renewal of nuclear related sanctions easing under the nuclear deal for a change in Iranian regional behavior," said Ellie Geranmayeh, policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations.

So who loses out if Trump does decide to abandon the nuclear deal?
Iran's economy
Iran has the fourth largest crude reserves in the world and also claims nearly one-fifth of the planet's natural gas.
Oil is a vital part of the economy. The country has ramped up production since sanctions were eased to about 3.8 million barrels a day. That's about a million barrels a day more than in 2015.
Iran's big return to global markets complicated attempts by OPEC producers and others to reduce a supply glut that had sent prices crashing.
Tehran insisted on keeping its production near four million barrels a day, in line with the amount it was pumping before sanctions were imposed. It got its wish and was given an exemption from OPEC's agreement to cut output.

Airplane makers
The biggest deals signed with foreign companies so far have been for airplanes to modernize Iran's creaking fleet.
Boeing (BA) signed an $8 billion deal to sell 80 jets to Iran Air after the sanctions were lifted.
Earlier this month, it also signed an agreement to sell 30 737 MAX airplanes worth $3 billion to Aseman Airlines, another Iranian carrier.
European rival Airbus (EADSY) wants a share of the action too. It has agreed to sell 100 jets to Iran for about $10 billion. But even that deal could be in jeopardy if Trump decides to get tough with Tehran since the jets include parts made in America and Airbus would need U.S. approval.
"While it is still too early to definitively state the Trump administration's position on [Iran], the early returns do not look promising. It has no discernible plans to pursue American trade and investment with Iran, or make it easier for other countries to do so," said Reza Marashi, research director at the National Iranian American Council.
Oil companies and GE
Other foreign companies have also been eyeing Iran's huge potential.
France's Total has signed a $2 billion agreement to help Iran develop its giant South Pars gas field, together with Chinese state oil company CNPC.
General Electric (GE) said last year that it has "begun looking at potential business opportunities in Iran, while fully complying with the rules laid out by the U.S. government."
The next big test for the nuclear deal is likely to come in June, when sanctions waivers signed by President Obama will be due for renewal. It's the first time Trump will have to sign them.
"If the Trump administration does reissue the waivers, I think that is a significant turning point in which confidence in the deal will begin to grow," said Trita Parsi, author of Losing An Enemy - Obama, Iran and the Triumph of Diplomacy.
Bitcoin was worth under $500 a year ago. Today the digital currency trades at over $1,200. Back in 2013, Novogratz predicted Bitcoin's value would soar. He remembers people laughing at him at the time.
Since then, Bitcoin's price has been on a wild run. It surged to nearly $1,000 in late 2013 and then fell to under $250 in 2015. It started to fly again last year, around the time of the Brexit vote. It surpassed $1,000 in January of this year again and has kept climbing.
Now Novogratz is saying Bitcoin will go to $2,000.
But he also warned the Harvard Business School Club crowd that there will "likely be a bubble" in digital currencies. The best way to handle it, he argues, is the old Wall Street trick of diversification. Put a little money in a lot of different plays in digital currency.
Related: What is Bitcoin? Read CNN's explainer
For example, Novogratz was also an early investor in Ether. It's another digital currency that has quickly emerged as the No. 2 rival to Bitcoin. Novogratz says he bought Ether when it was trading for about $1. Today it's worth over $48.
Novogratz met Vitalik Buterin, the young Russian brainchild behind Ether at a dinner party at a prominent CEO's home. He recalls that Buterin, then 21, showed up late, which struck him as shocking -- and a bit ballsy. He figured it was worth paying attention to Buterin.
Ether is a currency with a "smart contract" function that gives users additional security and abilities to transfer information in addition to monetary value.
We're witnessing the "3rd inning" of this digital asset revolution, Novogratz predicts. He's not exactly sure how it will play out, but he plans to continue investing in digital currencies and Blockchain, the revolutionary technology behind the scenes that makes Bitcoin work.
Blockchain is literally a digital ledger to record and track transactions. What makes it so technologically advanced is that multiple companies or parties can access the Blockchain and see the history of what happened to an asset.

Novogratz has emerged as one of the biggest Wall Street cheerleaders of Blockchain, but his bets haven't always gone so well. He exited Fortress in 2015 after the company shut down his Marco Fund for poor performance. It lost around 20% in its final year after his investments in emerging markets, especially Brazil, tanked.
"We have had an extremely challenging two years, and I do not believe the current environment is conducive to achieving our best results," Novogratz said at the time.
Verizon's stock is now down 10% this year while Sprint (S) and T-Mobile (TMUS) are both up. Verizon is also lagging key rival AT&T (T, Tech30) -- although Ma Bell's shares are down 5% in 2017. (AT&T is in the process of acquiring CNNMoney owner Time Warner (TWX).)
Verizon and AT&T are both facing tougher competition from their two smaller rivals, who have aggressively marketed unlimited calling, texting and data plans.
Verizon's quarterly subscriber loss was the first of its so-called postpaid wireless customers in the company's history.
(Postpaid subscribers pay as they go, getting a monthly bill, while prepaid customers pay in advance for a certain allotment of minutes and messages.)
Wall Street analysts were predicting that Verizon had added more than 200,000 postpaid subscribers in the quarter. So Verizon clearly disappointed investors -- by a mile.
But there was some good news. Verizon said that since it launched its own unlimited monthly plan back in mid-February, it added 109,000 postpaid customers.
They key for Verizon though will be whether or not it can build on the momentum from the end of the quarter.
Verizon also is still juggling many different balls in the air. The company is in the process of acquiring the core assets of Yahoo. Verizon plans to merge the Yahoo business with its AOL unit and rename the combined company with the odd moniker of Oath.
Yahoo (YHOO, Tech30) said in its own earnings report earlier this week that it expected the Verizon deal to close sometime by the end of June.
Related: Yahoo and AOL will be part of a new company called Oath
But some investors aren't sure if the merger of Yahoo and AOL will actually make the two -- which were kings of the Internet in the late 1990s but have suffered a fall from grace since then -- more competitive against the likes of Google (GOOGL, Tech30) and Facebook (FB, Tech30).
It doesn't help that Verizon said in Thursday's earnings report that AOL's revenues fell 4% in the first quarter.
That's led to chatter that Verizon may not be done shopping.
And Verizon CEO Lowell McAdam further fueled the merger talks earlier this week, saying in an interview with Bloomberg that he'd be open to talks with Disney (DIS), Comcast (CMCSA) or CBS (CBS) if the heads of any of those companies gave him a call about a deal.
There has also been speculation that Verizon could be interested in buying cable company Charter (CHTR).
But MoffettNathanson analyst Craig Moffett doesn't think Verizon really wants to do a gigantic transformative media deal like AT&T, which has also scooped up DirecTV, has.
Moffett wrote in a report that Verizon is likely to remain focused on wireless. He said Verizon still believes, that for better or for worse, it can "win through a strategy of network superiority."
Can you hear that now, Wall Street?
CNNTech's Kaya Yurieff contributed to this report.
And he apparently took matters into his own hands and shot off a letter to Elliott Management's founder Paul Singer.
In the letter, Kleinfeld talked about Singer's 2006 family trip to Germany to watch the FIFA World Cup soccer tournament.
"It was much to my delight when I recently learned from Berlin what a phenomenal soccer enthusiast you must be," Kleinfeld wrote.
Kleinfeld then appeared to mock Singer for allegedly performing the classic Gene Kelly show tune "Singin' in the Rain" in a water fountain during the Germany visit.
The letter says: "By the way: 'Singing in the Rain' is indeed a wonderful classic -- even though I never tried to sing it in a fountain."
He ominously added that "quite a few people who accompanied you in Berlin in 2006 during and especially after the many matches you attended are still full of colorful memories about this obviously remarkable time."
Kleinfeld concluded the letter by saying that he was sending Singer a World Cup 2006 soccer ball as "a token of my appreciation to learn about this completely 'other side' of you" and said that if "I manage to find a native American Indian's feather headdress I will send this additional essential part of the memories."
It's unclear what exactly Kleinfeld was referring to with regards to the headdress.
Elliott Management released the letter, which it said Singer received on April 11, late Wednesday. The firm also released its responses to Arconic.
Arconic said Monday that Kleinfeld sent the letter "without consultation with, or authorization by the Board" and that the letter "showed poor judgment."
Elliott Management, which has also made waves recently for taking on Samsung over corporate governance issues, didn't find the letter to be amusing either.
The company's general counsel and chief legal officer, Richard Zabel, fired back a letter to Arconic's board on April 12.
"While much of what it says doesn't make sense, we do understand Dr. Kleinfeld to be making veiled suggestions that he might intimidate or extort Mr. Singer based on Mr. Singer's family trip to Germany in 2006, when he attended the World Cup," Zabel wrote.
Zabel added that "this is highly inappropriate behavior by anyone and certainly by the CEO of a regulated, publicly traded company, in the midst of a proxy contest, and it raises a number of obvious issues."
Five days later, Kleinfeld was out of a job.
To use a soccer term Kleinfeld might appreciate, he scored an own goal -- accidentally kicking the ball into the wrong net.
Exxon said it does not comment on "ongoing issues."
But there are powerful reasons why Houston-based Exxon would want to get back into business with the state-backed firm: Their agreement to form a joint venture, signed in 2011, allowed Exxon to conduct offshore exploration in the Black Sea and the Kara Sea in Siberia.
The undeveloped oil fields are thought to be the most promising in the Russian Arctic, according to S&P Global Platts.
In 2012, the two firms agreed to jointly develop more oil reserves in Siberia and establish a research center in the Arctic.
Plans to build a large natural gas plant near Vladivostock in eastern Russia followed in 2013.
The deepening relationship was put on hold, however, after the U.S., European Union and other Western countries imposed sanctions on Russia in 2014 over its role in the crisis in Ukraine.
Exxon, which has been operating in Russia for more than 20 years, was allowed to finish some of its projects. But then the drilling stopped.
A lot has changed since then. The Russian economy has turned the corner, emerging from a painful recession in the final quarter of 2016.
Oil prices have climbed back above $50 per barrel.
Related: Russia could soon control a U.S. oil company
Still, the waiver request is a major political gambit for Exxon.
The Trump administration is under intense scrutiny over its ties to Moscow. The fact that the current secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, spearheaded the Rosneft deal while CEO of Exxon, has drawn even more attention to the waiver request.
Tillerson has recused himself from all government matters involving Exxon. He also sold all his stock in the firm, and is placing the shares he would have received over the next decade into an independently managed trust.
But a political storm appears to be brewing.
Sen. John McCain, a Republican, asked "Are they crazy?" when news of the waiver application broke. McCain is a leading critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Are they crazy? @WSJ: "Exxon Seeks U.S. Waiver to Resume #Russia Oil Venture" https://t.co/CHKS3sjOa8

Rep. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intel Committee, said that the waiver should be denied.
"The Treasury Department should reject any waiver from sanctions which would allow Exxon Mobile or any other company to resume business with prohibited Russian entities," he said in a statement. "Until Russia abides by the Minsk accords and ends its illegal occupation of Crimea, the only changes to sanctions should be their intensification, not their dilution."
Still, the financial incentives for Exxon are powerful when it comes to Russia.
In March of 2016, Tillerson said that Exxon was "very anxious to get back to work there."
It's a hope echoed by his successor.
"In Russia, we're there for the long term," CEO Darren Woods said in a February interview with Forbes.

GM (GM) is just the latest major multinational company to report massive problems from operations in Venezuela. The country is in the midst of weeks of bloody protests by its citizens demanding a change of government after years of political turmoil and a severe economic crisis.
In 2015, Pepsi (PEP) took a massive $1.4 billion loss from its business in Venezuela, citing the country's plummeting currency and political mess. At the time, Pepsi said it will no longer count its Venezuela business in its overall revenues.

Mondelez (MDLZ), maker of Oreos, wrote off its Venezuela business after taking nearly a $800 million loss last year. Although it sells Oreos and other products in Venezuela, it doesn't count that business in its overall operations.
McDonald's (MCD) still operates in Venezuela, but in the last two years it's had to temporarily halt sales of french fries and Big Macs due to food shortages.
Delta (DAL), American (AAL), United (UAL) and other airlines are collectively still trying to claw back $3.8 billion in profits frozen in Venezuela. Those airlines, along with Lufthansa, Alitalia and LATAM, either drastically reduced flights to Venezuela or stopped flying there entirely.
Coca-Cola (KO) has recorded multiple losses in recent years from its Venezuela business, and it temporarily halted production there last year due to a lack of sugar supply in the country. But it still operates there.
Venezuela is home to the world's largest oil reserves. That used to attract oil service providers like Baker Hughes (BHI) and Schlumberger (SLB). But in the past year, they've shut down some of the rigs that dredge up Venezuela's oil, citing unpaid bills from the government. It's a major reason why Venezuela's critical oil production is in sharp decline.
Nearly 10% of U.S. companies in the S&P 500 -- 46 firms -- have had exposure at one point since 2015 to Venezuela's plunging currency, the bolivar, which is worth less than one penny now. IBM (IBM, Tech30), Oracle (ORCL, Tech30), DirecTV (DIRV), GE (GE), and Ford (F) are among firms that have mentioned at one point exposure to Venezuela in earnings reports and many of them have stopped counting any revenue from Venezuela.

The corporate exodus is only one thread of a country in crisis mode. On Wednesday, three people died in nationwide protests against President Nicolas Maduro.
Protests have ramped up in recent weeks after Maduro's administration barred popular opposition leader Henrique Capriles from holding any political office for 15 years.
Due to the economic crisis, Venezuelans continue to live through food and medical shortages, along with skyrocketing prices for basics that are available. Food imports fell 50% last year, which is a disaster in a country that grows little of its own food, after years of the government neglecting the country's vast agricultural resources.

That might be because his administration proposes cutting federal funding for job training programs, though it hasn't spelled out how much, according to the Office of Budget and Management. It wants states, cities and towns to carry the weight of funding job training programs.
It's a view at odds with is predecessor, President Obama, who broke records on federal spending for job training and apprenticeships.
It also doesn't jive with the view of many economists and employers. Trump got to meet one of those employers on Tuesday.
Related: What American manufacturing looks like in Trump era
When Trump went to Kenosha, Wisconsin, to tout his Buy American executive order he told a crowd of technical students and manufacturing employees at the headquarters of Snap-On Tools: "The buy and hire American order I'm about to sign will protect workers and students like you."
But Snap-On CEO Nicholas Pinchuk too wants to focus on job skills, not H1-B visas. As the head of the tool manufacturing company, he knows where the problem lies.
"The best way to make America successful...is to arm our people with the technical capabilities that enable them to win that global contest for prosperity," Pinchuk said in a statement on the company's website.
Pinchuk isn't alone. America's top economist, Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen, emphasized that point in a speech in late March.
"Educational programs and training that lead to better paying and more steady work are crucial for people without college degrees, particularly lower-income workers," Yellen said.

In short, research, anecdotes and experts show that job skills and training -- not restricting H1-B visas -- is the solution to a lot of problems for American workers.
For example, former coal workers in Pennsylvania are learning to write computer code -- a skill in high demand -- at a free retraining program called Mined Mines, a non-profit.
America had 5.7 million job openings in February. That's hovering near an all-time high. Part of that is good because employers are hiring. Part of it is bad because it means some employers just can't find skilled workers to match their openings.
Trump did briefly touch on job skills Tuesday, saying education secretary Betsy DeVos "is working to ensure that our workers are trained for the skilled technical jobs that will, in the future, power our country."
Trump also said, "workforce development and vocational training -- very important words," when German Chancellor Angela Merkel visited in March.
But as Trump aims to cut down government spending, his words aren't backed up by important funding for job training and apprenticeship programs.

Federal job training programs have had issues. The Labor Department's own 2012 study found flaws in the job training programs for workers who lose positions due to free trade. Workers ended up in jobs they didn't want or didn't pay as much as their previous jobs.
However, that is just one type of job training program, and liberals and conservatives alike tend to agree that most job training programs and apprenticeships are key to middle-class jobs, especially for those without a 4-year college degree.
The White House's Office of Management and Budget did not respond to request for comment.
Federal spending hasn't come to a complete halt yet. On Wednesday, the Labor Department approved $3.2 million in grants for training and reemployment services for workers in California affected by layoffs.

Agranoff's lightbulb moment came in 2013 at a high-school basketball game, where he noticed most kids were wearing the same plain Nike athletic socks. If these simple socks started such a craze, he wondered: What would happen if he kicked things up a notch and printed custom designs on them?

Related: An Indian technologist creating factory jobs in America
Fast forward four years, and HoopSwagg now offers more than 200 original designs created by Agranoff himself: a mix of goofy (a melting ice cream cone), funky (a spoof of the infamous Portland International Airport carpet) and tongue-in-cheek ("goat farm," a family inside joke scattered with photos of the real animals on the family's property). Agranoff also wants to allow customers to create their own designs in the future.
The company is now shipping 70 to 100 orders a day, with each pair of socks priced at $14.99. And this week, HoopSwagg announced its first acquisition: It bought competitor TheSockGame.com, which will add over 300 designs to the portfolio and help expand HoopSwagg's customer base.
But HoopSwagg started small. After Agranoff's initial idea at the school basketball game, he spent six months researching logistics like machinery and technology needed for custom digital printing on fabric.
He then made the case to two potential investors: his parents. "They thought the concept was a little out there," Agranoff said. But he was persistent and ultimately received a $3,000 loan.
In true startup fashion, HoopSwagg launched in the family garage in Sherwood, Oregon, just outside of Portland. Agranoff set up the design printing and heat presser machines with his family's help. He enlisted his parents to buy "as many white athletic socks as they could get from Dick's Sporting Goods."
Hoopswagg's first year was slow. But momentum grew quickly after the socks -- which Agranoff said are "for everyone from 6-year-olds to 80-year-olds" -- took off on social media.
Related: Stores are scooping up this nut-free ice cream
Agranoff leveraged his own social network and targeted a group of social influencers to help spread the word. In particular, the sock design inspired by the Portland airport's former teal-and-geometric-shape pattern went viral, bringing more attention to the brand.
As sales soared, the company quickly outgrew the garage. The Agranoff family built a 1,500-square-foot building on their property to accommodate production, warehousing and shipping.
His mother joined the business full-time, and Agranoff also has 17 other part-time employees. But self-sufficiency is key to his success, he said. Agranoff also taught himself to code, so he could better set up and manage his business' website, and how to use graphic design tools to develop the designs. He remains the company's only graphic designer, though he is colorblind.

For now, the socks are primarily sold through HoopSwagg's website and via Amazon (AMZN, Tech30), eBay (EBAY) and Etsy. The next three years are pivotal for HoopSwagg, said Agranoff, who wants the brand to be in retail stores," said Agranoff. He's also expanding customization to other products like shoelaces, arm sleeves and ties.
Meanwhile, Agranoff is set to graduate high school six months early. While college is in the plan at some point, he's slated to focus on HoopSwagg full-time after high school graduation. He currently spends about six hours per day on the business, after putting in a day of school and finishing his homework.
While Agranoff has never taken a business class, he learned a lot by buying items at garage sales and selling them on eBay -- a pursuit he began when he was eight.
"So really, I've been learning how to do this for a while," said Agranoff. "Especially today, with all the information available on the internet, you can't be too young to learn how to be an entrepreneur."
"We've done everything we can to turn over every stone," Sloan told CNN's Poppy Harlow in an exclusive interview this week.
Those unauthorized accounts -- and dismissals -- are on top of the two million fake accounts that regulators say Wells Fargo (WFC) opened between 2011 and 2015, which led to 5,300 firings.
Last year, after the scandal broke, the bank committed to look at problems going back to 2009. Sloan said the new findings won't change the timeline.
CNN pushed back, asking how then is the company truly getting to the bottom of it to repair its culture if it's putting the onus on customers to flag what the bank had done wrong.
"If they have a concern about their account, they should come in and see us," said Sloan, who was promised to repair Wells Fargo's broken trust with customers and employees. He cited "challenges" with the "quality of the data" that goes back that far.

Wells Fargo stressed that in the wake of the scandal, it reached out to about 40 million retail customers, as well as 3 million small business customers through messages, mailing and online. The bank has refunded more than $3.2 million to customers on about 130,000 potentially-unauthorized accounts.
"We need to make things right with our customers," Sloan said.
He called the massive investigation by Wells Fargo's board of directors both "spot on" and "very hard to read" given his nearly 30 years at the company.
That board report found that Wells Fargo's own internal investigations division found problems going back to 2002 and flagged them. In fact, in the summer of 2002, the investigation "determined that almost an entire branch in Colorado engaged in a form of 'gaming' in connection with a promotional campaign" that year. The incident involved improper teller referral credits, as well as "employees issuing debit cards without customer consent."
John Stumpf, Wells Fargo's longtime CEO who stepped down suddenly last year amid the scandal, was made aware of the Colorado incident, according to the board report. Stumpf became head of the community banking unit in 2002, and seemingly continued to ignore the issues over the years.

Wells Fargo's board clawed back an additional $28 million from Stumpf last week saying he was "too slow to investigate or critically challenge" the bank's sales tactics. The report concluded that Stumpf's commitment to the bank's sales culture led him to "minimize problems" despite "growing indications that the situation was worsening."
Sloan, who worked closely with Stumpf, acknowledged that his former boss "made some mistakes, like we all made mistakes."
But Sloan declined to say whether he felt misled by his former boss.
"The best person to ask is John Stumpf," Sloan said.

United (UAL) CEO Oscar Munoz has apologized several times and said he accepts full responsibility for the incident, which has turned into a PR nightmare for the company. But he has received the backing of the board and no one has been fired.
Clark said he would have gone further had he been in charge.
"Had it been me in that position I would've have had blue flashing lights on cars going right through the company to find out how this could've been allowed to happen in the first place. That was probably the last thing I do before I resigned."
A video of Dr. David Dao being dragged off an aircraft in Chicago after he refused to give up his seat to make room for United crew went viral on social media, prompting a fierce backlash against the airline.
Munoz's early statements described the passenger as being re-accommodated and suggested he had been "disruptive and belligerent."

Rival airlines, including Emirates, trolled United with advertisements right after the incident.
Emirates and the other Gulf carriers, Etihad Airways and Qatar Airways, have been at odds with major American airlines for years.
Delta Air (DAL), United Airlines (UAL) and American Airlines (AAL) have repeatedly complained that state subsidies have given the Gulf carriers an unfair advantage. Emirates, Etihad and Qatar Airways all deny the accusation.
"We're just expecting to get slammed," said Craig "C.J." Fuchs of Studio420, a pipe shop and smoking room in Englewood, Colorado. "We're expecting to be probably packed from Thursday to Sunday."
Fuchs, who owns the business with his father, Marty, said he's doubling his usual entry fee to $20 for the 4/20 weekend. Patrons are allowed to smoke at Studio420 even though Fuchs doesn't sell weed, just the merchandise for it. But for those retailers who do, 4/20 provides an annual boom for pot sales.

"What we do see is a pretty heavy spike, anywhere from 30% to 40% in the week leading up, and in the days after," said Grant Pettrie, sales director for Denver-based Potguide.com, an information source on marijuana law and business as well as dispensaries and discounts. "There's more of an uptick because it's becoming more accepted."
Recreational marijuana is legal in Washington, D.C., and eight states, including five states that legalized it just last year. In Colorado, Oregon and Washington state, all of which have had a legal recreational market for years, 4/20 has taken on the trappings of a de facto sales holiday, like Valentine's Day for florists and jewelers or New Year's for health clubs and liquor stores.
Related: The vice that's not welcome in Sin City
"Yes, 4/20 really does show a large increase in sales," said Justin Viviani, manager of The Oregon Weedery, a dispensary in Portland. "Last year 4/20 was on Wednesday, traditionally our slowest day of the week, and we saw a 300% increase in visits and sales."
Viviani said he'll be offering discounts on new products, as well as live music at the dispensary with free "non-medicated" snacks.
This year, 4/20 is on a Thursday, which puts it closer to the weekend. Viviani believes this could lead to even stronger sales, so he's stocking up.
"We will be heavily staffed with extra budtenders that day," he said. "We package our own flower and craft our own joints so we will be doing a lot of pre-work just to stay stocked."
Related: Trump is a buzzkill for pot stocks
It's not just dispensaries that see extra business around 4/20. Retailers that sell smoking implements, marijuana-themed clubs and smoking rooms and producers of cannabis products like edibles and tinctures also get boosts.
According to New Frontier, a research company that analyzes the marijuana industry, sales on 4/20 tend to be several times higher than on other days, and discounts play a role in driving that.
In classic Black Friday fashion, many retailers offer 4/20 discounts of up to 30% for medical marijuana, and up to 50% for recreational, according to Pettrie of Potguide.com.
"This is a really good time to stock up on product," he said.
Green Man Cannabis, a company with two dispensaries in Denver, fuels the 30% sales bump it has seen on 4/20 with discounts of nearly 50% on pre-rolled joints and 20% on marijuana purchases of at least a quarter-ounce.
Native Roots, a company with 14 dispensaries in Colorado, is marking 4/20 with its "smokin' token promotion," where any customer buying an ounce of marijuana during the month of April could potentially win 12 free ounces, distributed one per month over the next year.
But not everyone is jumping on the 4/20 band wagon. Punit Seth, CEO and co-founder of the newly released marijuana brand Toast, isn't offering any discounts for his $85 10-packs of cannabis cigarettes.
"4/20 is almost like St. Patrick's Day for alcohol; it's about getting as messed up as possible," said Seth, whose web site depicts models in suits and furs puffing weed in a chic-looking lounge. "We want our product to be held in a different light."

Veterans eligible for Medicaid expansion -- individuals earning up to $16,400 -- saw the largest drop in uninsured rates. Prior to Obamacare, some 21.6% of these vets lacked coverage. By 2015, this share fell to 12.2%. The declines were largest in the states that expanded Medicaid.
Related: Trump sends mixed signals on Obamacare
Veterans who qualify for subsidies on the Obamacare exchanges -- a single person earning up to $47,500 -- also saw declines. Some 10.6% were uninsured in 2013, but only 6.6% were two years later.
Veterans' families also benefited from Obamacare. The uninsured rate among spouses fell to 5.5% from 9.2%, while the rate among children fell to 2.9% from 4.5%.
The majority of uninsured vets were older than age 45, and half of them worked full-time.
The Urban Institute report came out the same day President Trump signed an executive order extending the Veterans Choice Program, an Obama administration initiative that allows veterans unable to get timely care at a Veterans Administration facility to go to a non-VA provider.
The review painted a damning picture of the OCC's ability to spot what in retrospect should have been obvious problems at one of the nation's biggest banks.
The OCC did confront Carrie Tolstedt, then head of Wells Fargo's community bank, about the stunning number of whistleblower claims. However, there are no records that show that federal inspectors "investigated the root cause," or force Wells Fargo to probe it.
It's now clear that root cause of Wells Fargo's problems -- both the creation of fake accounts and the related 5,300 firings -- was the notoriously aggressive sales goals targets set by senior management. At one point, rank and file bankers were asked to open as many as eight accounts per customer. That's why the bank has eliminated them.
From top management to Wells Fargo's board of directors, everyone turned a blind eye to these issues. There's evidence now that some of this was flagged as early as 2004 to management.
And the OCC report says that Wells Fargo's board of directors received "regular" reports going back to 2005 indicating that most ethics line complaints and firings were related to sales violations.
That appears to be earlier than the Wells Fargo board has indicated it was aware of a problem. A 110-page investigation launched by Wells Fargo's board said the bank's management did not flag sales practices as "noteworthy risks" to the board prior to 2014.
The OCC examiners in charge of Wells Fargo received those same reports "since at least early 2010," the review found.

Ultimately, it took until September 2016 for several federal authorities, including the OCC, to finally sanction Wells Fargo. Wells Fargo's $185 million settlement over the creation of some 2 million fake accounts and 5,300 firings created a firestorm so great that the OCC told Congress it would launch an internal review over what went wrong.
Within the past few weeks, the OCC has removed its top Wells Fargo inspector from his duties monitoring the bank, a person familiar with the matter previously told CNNMoney. That examiner, Bradley Linskens, had been in charge of Wells Fargo since March 2014 and oversaw a team of 60 to 70 OCC employees, according to the source.
Wells Fargo declined to comment about the OCC's new findings.
"We made a number of mistakes, there's no question about it," Wells Fargo CEO Tim Sloan told CNN's Poppy Harlow this week. "We had an incentive compensation plan that drove inappropriate behavior."
Sloan said he's focused on "fixing what was broken" and "making things right" with customers and employees.
The OCC review may help explain how the Wells Fargo scandal was able to go on as long as it was. The massive investigation by Wells Fargo's board of directors found evidence of "mass terminations" related to improper sales tactics that went back to "at least 2002."
Related: Top federal Wells Fargo inspector removed
Regulators were apparently aware of hundreds of instances where employees spoke up about problems as well.
But the OCC "failed to document resolution of whistleblower cases," the OCC review found, adding that these early warnings were not properly researched, analyzed or resolved.
When OCC examiners asked Tolstedt about the 700 cases of whistleblower complaints "related to gaming of incentive plans" in 2010, she downplayed the issue, according to the OCC.
The report said Tolstedt claimed that the "high number of complaints" was the result of a culture that "encourages" complaints that are "investigated and appropriately addressed."
The Wells Fargo board report too had similarly concluded that Tolstedt "resisted and impeded scrutiny" and even "minimized the scale and nature of problems."
Tolstedt also told the OCC that Wells Fargo's incentive programs are "capped" at 10% to 20% of total cash compensation "to keep motivation in check," the OCC said.
In addition to the post-mortem on its supervision of Wells Fargo, the OCC is still carrying out a review of sales tactics by other large national banks to look for potential problems.
"That review is underway and we will not be commenting on the ongoing supervisory work," an OCC spokesman said in a statement.
And last month Trump vowed to end "the war on coal" by canceling "job-killing regulations" and putting miners back to work.
It's true that there are a lot fewer jobs in steel and coal than there used to be in the United States. But those industries are being battered by a lot more than foreign imports and cumbersome government rules.
In fact, they are being eroded by long-term changes in the economy, and in the industries themselves, that won't be reversed by any piece of paper Trump can sign.

About 300,000 steel mill jobs have disappeared in the last 40 years, a 70% drop.
American steel is facing tougher competition from foreign producers, such as those in China. About 25% of the steel used in the United States last year came from foreign sources. That's one reason the industry cheered Trump's executive order on government contracts.
But infrastructure accounts for a relatively small amount of the nation's steel consumption -- a bit less than 10%, according to the American Iron and Steel Institute, the industry trade group.
And foreign competition is nothing new for the steel industry. Imports have never fallen below 15% of the U.S. market in the last 40 years. Most years they have accounted for 20% or more.
Related: Coal country's message to Trump - We want jobs of the future
The large American mills that turn iron ore and other raw materials into steel face more competition from domestic "mini-mills," which melt scrap steel into steel products, than they do from overseas.
Traditional steel mills accounted for nearly 80% of domestic production 40 years ago. Today they have only about a third. Beleaguered steel towns have more to worry about than a mill halfway across the globe.
Steel jobs are being lost to improved technology that has made steelmaking far more efficient. In the early 1980s, it took 10 hours of work to produce a ton of steel. Today it take less than two hours, according to industry figures.
Related: Trump move to roll back climate rules won't bring coal or mining jobs
Coal mining jobs, meanwhile, have also fallen 70% since 1985, a loss of 120,000 jobs.
The coal industry has lost much of its customer base not because of regulations but because natural gas production has soared, pushing down the price of that cleaner source of electrical power.
In addition, falling costs for green energy, such as solar and wind power, have cut the demand for coal. So has a move by overseas markets, like China, to shift away from coal in an attempt to clean up badly polluted air.
"There are a lot of market forces already driving the utility industry towards cleaner energy," said Kevin Rennert, visiting fellow with Resources for the Future, a Washington think tank concentrating on energy issues. Getting rid of rules to combat global warming "doesn't change that," he said.
The good news is that those industries have produced a jobs boom of their own that has dwarfed the jobs losses in coal mines. In January, the U.S. Energy Department estimated that solar power today accounts for 373,000 jobs, while wind power accounts for an additional 101,000.

After the ferocious Trump rally lifted U.S. stocks to record highs, fund managers have also become more cautious about Wall Street. Their allocation to U.S. stocks has plunged to the lowest level since January 2008, according to the BofA survey that was released on Wednesday.
"Investors are showing love for Europe and scrambling out of U.S. equities," Michael Hartnett, BofA's chief investment strategist, wrote in the report.
The problem they have with Wall Street is that stocks have become expensive. All told, 83% of fund managers think the U.S. market is the most "overvalued" region in the world, the highest level in the 17-year history of the survey.
But is now the most prudent time to rush headfirst into Europe?
Related: French candidate wants a 100% tax on the rich
Eurozone stocks have retreated about 2% this month amid apprehension over the radical ideas endorsed by leading candidates in France's presidential election. The first round of voting in this race takes place on April 23 and the top two candidates are set to square off in a second round on May 7.
The matchup features one far-right candidate, Marine Le Pen, who wants France to dump the euro. Such a move could call into question the entire existence of the common currency, a move that would lead to volatility in global financial markets.
Another surging candidate, socialist Jean-Luc Melenchon, is pushing for a 100% tax on income above $425,000 and for France to leave NATO, the IMF and the World Trade Organization.
"There is a great deal of concern that from a market perspective we could have two bad candidates to choose from in the second round," said Erin Browne, head of macro investing at UBS O'Connor, a hedge fund division inside the Swiss bank.
Browne warned that the French election could spark trouble in the European banking system that creates a "fairly significant risk-off event across markets."

Despite those concerns, investors have been lured into European stocks by hopes that a rebound in corporate profits there will make current low valuations look cheap in retrospect.
BofA said cash is rotating out of U.S. stocks and into the eurozone at one of the fastest clips since 1999.
"Although we agree on the allure of Europe's earnings recovery, complacency looks extremely high," Ronan Carr, BofA's European equity strategist, wrote.
The picture could clear up after the French presidential election.
"If we were to take away the French elections, or they go well, European assets are a great place to buy right now. You just need to be careful about the geopolitical risks," Browne said.
Of course, political risk exists in the U.S., too.
The Trump rally was built on expectations that Republican control of the executive and legislative branches would lead to quick and sweeping tax reform that would lift corporate profits and stimulate the economy.
But deep divisions within the GOP have forced Wall Street to dial back those hopes. Even Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told the Financial Times this week that a deal on tax reform is unlikely by the August recess deadline he previously set.
BofA said only 5% of investors surveyed now expect tax reform before the summer recess, but almost half anticipate a deal before the end of the year.
"The market was overly optimistic about the timing of tax cuts," said UBS's Browne. Still, she said a package of tax cuts and modest reform is "realistically achievable" by the first quarter of 2018.

Laffer thinks that's the wrong move. Laffer advised Trump during the campaign. He's an informal counselor now, but he's telling everyone in the White House who will listen to do what the Reagan team did: break up tax reform into small bits instead of trying to cram it all into one huge bill.
The easy win would be cutting business taxes, Laffer argues. It could even be done by August (the original deadline the White House set for action on taxes but has since backed away from).
"There's no one who thinks a 35% federal corporate tax rate is appropriate," Laffer says. He notes the U.S. has the highest tax rate on businesses out of any major economy in the world.
Trump proposed slashing business taxes to 15% on the campaign trail. Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan has pushed for a 20% top rate on business.

Republican economists tell Trump: Cut taxes ASAP
There's a loud chorus of right-leaning economists telling Trump to drop health care and move on to tax cuts. In an Op-Ed in the New York Times on Wednesday, four of Trump's top economic advisers from the campaign -- Laffer, Steve Forbes, Larry Kudlow and Stephen Moore (a CNN contributor) -- wrote, "Tax reform probably should have gone first, but now is the time to move it forward with urgency."
The Op-Ed comes on the heels of Glenn Hubbard, President George W. Bush's top economist, giving Trump that same advice back in March.
It's notable though that Goldman Sachs (GS), the Wall Street firm that used to employ several of Trump's top advisers, now predicts tax cuts are "likely to slip to early 2018."
The chorus of GOP economists says Trump should enact business tax cuts in 2017 and then tax reform for individuals in 2018.

Arthur Laffer says: Cut taxes but don't cut spending yet

Laffer says the only reason Trump wants to tackle health care first is because overhauling Obamacare could generate more money for the U.S. Treasury. However, he argues Congress and the White House should stop obsessing about having tax cuts "paid for." That would mean tax cuts do not add anything to America's $19 trillion debt.
"The 'pay for rule' is the silliest rule I have ever heard in my life," Laffer says. "You cannot balance the budget in the U.S. without growth."
Laffer is telling Trump to cut taxes now and keep government spending about the same. The Trump Administration doesn't appear to be heeding that advice. The White House is mulling deep cuts to the federal budget in order to fund an increase in military spending.
"Do not cut government spending right away. Wait until tax cuts have their effect on economic growth," Laffer cautions.

How to revive Trump's approval rating
Trump's approval rating is just 41%, according to Gallup. That's actually up from 35% a few weeks ago. But Laffer says Reagan faced something just as bad in his early years in the White House.
"Our first two years were a disaster," Laffer says of the Reagan administration. He believes Trump will rebound if he gets back on track with tax cuts. "People criticized Reagan non-stop. Reagan made gaffes as well."
President Reagan's approval rating did hit a low of 35% as well, but that didn't happen until 1983, two years into Reagan's first term. During his first 100 days in office, Reagan had an approval rating of almost 70%.

The Kansas warning sign?
Laffer is a big champion of cutting taxes to spur growth. He's often called the father of "supply-side economics" for his research on how cutting taxes can actually bring the government more revenue.
But Laffer's theories have come under heavy criticism lately. Many point to Kansas, a state that cut taxes in 2012 and has since faced massive budget shortfalls and a floundering economy, as proof that Laffer is wrong.
Laffer says the real problem in Kansas is that Republican Governor Sam Brownback didn't go far enough.
"The tax cut was too small. It was a rounding error," Laffer told CNNMoney.
His theory was that it took fewer workers in Portugal, a country with a long history of wine making, to make wine than it does to make cloth in that country. And it took fewer workers to make cloth in England, a textile powerhouse at the time, than to produce wine there.
Thus, Portugal should export its wine to England, while England should export cloth to Portugal. Workers weren't the only factor. Other considerations were equipment, skills and the value of currencies.

The idea in a nut shell: Focus on your biggest advantages and sell them to other countries.
Ricardo called it "comparative advantage."
The main concept: You focus on the products you're most efficient at making and ship them to other countries. Then other countries focus on what they're most productive at making and export those products to you.
"The idea of comparative advantage has been an essential part of every economists' intellectual toolkit," Dartmouth professor and former Reagan trade adviser Doug Irwin wrote in a blog post Wednesday.
The same concept is true today in the U.S. economy.
Consider this example: the U.S. is a leader in manufacturing airplanes. Boeing (BA) exports its jets to countries and airlines around the world.
Related: Fed: Pulling out of NAFTA would hurt U.S. companies
For instance, Boeing sells planes to Avianca, the Colombian airline. Colombia doesn't have much of an airplane manufacturing industry. But Colombia does have a robust coffee industry. And Americans love coffee.
So, Ricardo's theory plays out on a very basic level in this interaction -- the U.S. imports loads of coffee from Colombia while Colombia buys U.S.-made planes.
More broadly, Ricardo's idea plays out across the global economy. The strength of the U.S. is largely in services like education and it has a trade surplus in services with the world. Mexico produces goods like car parts and it has a goods surplus with the U.S. and many other nations.
The problem in Trump's view is that Mexico, for instance, is selling more goods to the U.S. than the U.S. is selling to Mexico. That creates a trade deficit. Trump wants to eliminate that, but hasn't shared any details on how he would do it.
Ricardo's timeless theory could be tested again when the Trump administration renegotiates NAFTA, the free trade deal with Mexico and Canada, this year.
The U.S. though, with its Napa and Sonoma Valleys, does have at least one notable, comparative advantage over Mexico and Canada: Wine.
Dunkin' (DNKN) says it will offer its drinks on Amtrak's lower-priced Northeast Regional trains later this year.
On Acela trains, Dunkin' says its coffee will be available all day in first class and in the cafe car. The coffee will be brewed using the same equipment that Dunkin' Donuts uses at its stores.
Amtrak says the Acela Express has seen "significant growth" in revenue and market share over the past several years. The trains had 2.4 million customers in 2002.
This comes one day after its direct downtown rival Goldman Sachs (GS) disappointed Wall Street with lackluster results, sending its stock tumbling 5%.
And other banks, most notably Bank of America (BAC) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM), recently reported solid quarterly results too.
Morgan Stanley did particularly well in its bond trading unit. Revenue from fixed-income trading nearly doubled from a year ago.
Morgan Stanley chairman and CEO James Gorman said it was one of the "strongest quarters in recent years" for the company and that the bank remained confident even though "the environment remains uncertain."
Gorman didn't elaborate on what exactly was so uncertain. But concerns about the Trump administration's ability to push through infrastructure spending and tax reform plans through Congress have the potential to weigh on Morgan Stanley and other banks.
Trump had called for Congress to undo much of the Dodd-Frank financial reform laws. It is now uncertain whether that will get done anytime soon though. As such, many bank stocks have pulled back sharply from their post-election highs.
But Gorman seemed confident that changes will still eventually be made to Dodd-Frank.
He told analysts during the company's conference call Wednesday morning that "it is hard to imagine the regulatory burden increasing from this point forward and some of the policy proposals being floated make good common sense."
Turmoil in Europe, where worries about the rising tide of populism in the wake of Brexit and upcoming French elections, also has made some investors nervous.

Morgan Stanley CFO Jonathan Pruzan noted that European elections could impact the environment for new stock and bond offerings, which could hurt Morgan Stanley's underwriting businesses.
Morgan Stanley was one of the leading underwriters of this year's initial public offering of Snapchat parent company Snap Inc. (SNAP)
Still, Pruzan remained hopeful that demand for IPOs should remain healthy despite some concerns about more market volatility.
Investors clearly aren't worried either. Morgan Stanley's stock has outperformed Goldman Sachs this year -- and it has done so since the November presidential election and over the past 12 months as well.
Morgan Stanley's stock is now back in positive territory for 2017 thanks to its rally on Wednesday. Goldman Sachs shares are down 10%, putting it in a virtual three-way tie with oil giants Chevron (CVX) and Exxon Mobil (XOM) as the worst Dow stocks of 2017.
So even though Goldman Sachs has more friends in high places, it doesn't seem as if that's translating into a boost to its bottom line just yet. Morgan Stanley, on the other hand, is just chugging along -- and winning approval from Wall Street in the process.
Emirates and the other Gulf carriers, Etihad Airways and Qatar Airways, have been in the firing line of new U.S. policies on immigration and security.
Trump signed a revised executive order last month banning citizens of six Muslim-majority countries from entry. It was struck down by the courts, but the U.S. administration said it will appeal the decision.
Related: Qatar Airways CEO: Laptop ban doesn't make flying safer
Following the travel ban, the U.S. slapped 9 airlines flying from 10 airports in the Middle East and North Africa -- including the three Gulf carriers -- with an order prohibiting larger electronic devices in the cabin of aircraft.
Emirates allows passengers to check in their devices at the gate and offers loaner laptops to premium travelers. But that hasn't prevented a fall in the number of people wanting to fly with the airline to the U.S.
"Over the past three months, we have seen a significant deterioration in the booking profiles on all our U.S routes, across all travel segments," Emirates said in a statement.
"The recent actions taken by the U.S. government relating to the issuance of entry visas, heightened security vetting, and restrictions on electronic devices in aircraft cabins, have had a direct impact on consumer interest and demand for air travel into the U.S."

The Gulf airlines have enjoyed rapid growth in their U.S. operations in recent years.
Delta Air (DAL), United Airlines (UAL) and American Airlines (AAL) have repeatedly complained that state subsidies have given the Gulf carriers an unfair advantage. Emirates, Etihad and Qatar Airways all deny the accusation.
The American carriers want the U.S. government to review the Open Skies agreements that allow their Gulf rivals to fly freely from the United Arab Emirates and Qatar to any U.S. destination.
Speaking to CNNMoney last month, Emirates President Tim Clark rejected suggestions that the U.S. may have introduced the electronics ban as a way of hurting the American carriers' big rivals.
But Emirates isn't the only one feeling the pain. Qatar Airways has also been hit by the U.S. restrictions.
CEO Akbar Al Baker told CNNMoney it had seen a drop in demand, but bookings were only down by less than 10 per flight. Al Baker said the electronics ban would not make flying to the U.S. any safer.
But Wells Fargo's CEO Tim Sloan now has a message for his distrustful employees.
"It is safe to call the ethics line," Sloan told CNN's Poppy Harlow in an exclusive interview this week. Sloan wants to reassure employees they won't face retribution for flagging any unethical behavior they see at the embattled bank.
As the newly-appointed CEO, he is now in charge of cleaning up the scandal that ensued over creating some 2 million fake accounts and firing 5,300 workers.
Sloan insisted that even "one instance of retaliation" is "completely unacceptable."
Related: Listen to Poppy's entire Wells Fargo interview
After hearing about Wells Fargo (WFC) workers who say their lives were turned upside down by retaliation, Sloan said he thought about the problem in personal terms "not necessarily as a CEO...but as a father."
"The lens that I use is, 'Would I be comfortable if our sons or daughter or daughters-in-law called the ethics line if they worked at Wells Fargo and they had a problem?'" Sloan said. "And the short answer is yes."
Sloan has two sons and a daughter, all Millennials, none of whom work at Wells Fargo.
The Wells Fargo boss said the bank brought in a law firm to look at "hundreds of cases" where an employee called the ethics line and identified him or herself to see if they were fired or punished in any way within 12 months.
"We've gotten it down to a handful that we're spending more time looking at. If it turns out that we were in error, we will fix it with that team member," Sloan said.
But workers have lost a lot more than their jobs. Some whistleblowers have said their firings from Wells Fargo led to severe stress, anxiety and even the loss of their homes.
"They ruined my life," Bill Bado, who was fired from Wells Fargo eight days after sending an email to human resources about fake accounts, previously told CNNMoney.
Sloan declined to specify how these former workers' situations will be fixed, simply saying it "depends on the situation for that team member."

Wells Fargo's independent directors launched an exhaustive investigation last fall after the bank admitted to the misdeeds that went on for several years.
That probe, released last week, said that a "limited review" by a law firm "has not identified a pattern of retaliation" against the bank's employees.
But the 110-page report did say that "many employees felt that failing to meet sales goals could (and sometimes did) result in termination."
Sloan admitted that Wells Fargo's unrealistic sales goals were wrong and should have been eliminated earlier. Even Warren Buffett, the bank's leading shareholder, has said Wells Fargo made a "terrible mistake" by keeping in place sales goals that "corrupted people."
Now, Wells Fargo is reaching out to employees who left the bank "because they were uncomfortable" with the sales goals, the bank's culture or who were fired for "not meeting certain goals," according to Sloan.
The CEO said Wells Fargo has hired back roughly 1,000 former employees who may fit into those categories.
"We want those folks to come back to Wells Fargo," he said.
However, Sloan emphasized that the 5,300 fired employees -- workers that Wells Fargo says used sales tactics that violated the rules -- are not welcome back.
Of course, at least some of those 5,300 workers would argue they were trying to keep their job by meeting the unreasonable sales goals set by senior management.
"If you violate our code of ethics when you break the law, you can't work at Wells Fargo," Sloan said.
Before voting began Sunday, the contest had narrowed to a four-way race between candidates from across the political spectrum. Two of them -- far right politician Marine Le Pen and socialist Jean-Luc Melenchon proposed radical ideas on how to improve the economy. Both oppose free trade agreements and are highly critical of the euro.
Melenchon crashed out in Sunday's vote but Le Pen came second and now faces centrist reformer Emmanuel Macron in the run-off. But will either of them have the right prescription to cure France?

After years of slow growth, the country's GDP figures are finally turning higher. But they remain at very low levels.
The French economy expanded by 1.2% in 2016, according to the International Monetary Fund. The two larger economies in Europe -- Germany and the U.K. -- posted growth of 1.8% over the same period.

The IMF predicts growth of just 1.4% for France in 2017, one of the weakest rates in the EU.
Europe's lost generation: Young, educated and unemployed
France is also struggling to bring down its unemployment rate, which stands at roughly 10%. That's higher than the eurozone average and more than double the level of joblessness in Germany and Britain.

The unemployment problem is even worse for young people: 24% of those between the ages of 15 and 24 don't have a job.
Government debt, meanwhile, has ballooned to almost 90% of GDP, up from just 58% a decade ago.

There are a few bright spots, however. France has relatively low income inequality and fewer of its citizens are at risk of poverty than in Germany or the U.K.

The percentage of GDP that the government spends on social programs and welfare is much higher in France than other major economies.

The generous welfare system has led to higher budget deficits, however, and the French healthcare system is in desperate need of more cash. The IMF has called for economic reforms to bring public spending under control.

But why would millions of undocumented immigrants file their tax returns if they could easily fly under the radar?
"First of all, it's the law," said Jose Magaña-Salgado, a policy attorney at the Immigrant Legal Resource Center. "And these undocumented immigrants are trying to abide by the law and are fulfilling their civic and financial responsibilities."
Should they ever go before an immigration judge, it will also help their case.
Magaña-Salgado said judges tend to look more favorably upon immigrants who have a history of filing and paying their taxes. "Filing taxes helps to build a record of existence here in the United States if they are facing permanent deportation hearings," he said.
Many undocumented immigrants are also seeking to get a refund.
"Whether someone is documented or not, it doesn't mean that they shouldn't avail themselves to the tax laws of the U.S.," Magaña-Salgado said. "And if they are due a refund, it's because they paid more than their income required."
In order to file for a federal tax return, undocumented immigrants need to apply for an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN) from the Internal Revenue Service.
The IRS issues these numbers to individuals who must file taxes, but don't possess or aren't eligible for a Social Security number. ITINs are issued to people regardless of their immigration status. An ITIN doesn't give a person legal work authorization and doesn't provide eligibility for Social Security benefits, according to the IRS website.

But an ITIN will help an undocumented immigrant get a refund if they are owed one, no questions asked, said Steve Choi, executive director of the New York Immigration Coalition. "Same as they pay taxes if they owe, no questions asked," he said.
For the most part, undocumented immigrants don't need to fear that their tax information will be shared with federal immigration enforcement agencies.
According to the National Immigration Law Center, the IRS is generally prohibited from disclosing taxpayer information, even to other federal agencies.
However, certain exceptions apply.
For example, the IRS is required to disclose taxpayer information to certain U.S. Treasury Department employees when they request it for tax administration purposes or to other federal agencies if it's needed for a criminal investigation and a federal court has issued an order that it be provided, NILC said on it's website.
The threat to the euro is most acute in France, where people will vote Sunday in the final round of a presidential election that features Marine Le Pen. The far right politician wants France to abandon the currency union.
The euro, the currency of 19 EU countries, is the most visible symbol of the region's long experiment with economic integration since the end of World War II.
But it's now under threat from politicians on both the left and right who want to bring the lira, drachma, peseta and French franc out of retirement.
Here's why some Europeans want to kill the euro:
'Europe is not a nation'

For Alberto Bagnai, the case against the currency boils down to this: European countries are not the same, and so they shouldn't use the same currency.
"The basic point is that you cannot have a federal state among citizens from countries with such a different cultural past," said the Italian academic. "Without a European state, you cannot have European money."
Some European countries are richer, some are poorer, like American states. But unlike the U.S., the eurozone does not have a central government to decide on spending, tax and budget policies.
"The U.S. is a nation, there is a sense of common identity," he said.
That's not true in Europe, where there's little prospect of political unity because wealthier nations such as Germany would end up transferring money permanently to the less fortunate.
"Germany does not want this," said Bagnai. "We should stop telling fairy tales."
'Optical illusion'
Such deep divisions were not always so apparent.
The interest rates that Spain, Greece and Italy needed to pay creditors plummeted after they joined the euro -- putting them on a par with Germany.
"Investors looked at nominal interest rates and thought the Greeks have become German," said Bagnai. "It was kind of an optical illusion."
Then the financial crisis hit, and cracks in the monetary union began to show.

In Spain, policymakers weren't able to make the euro cheaper to counter the collapse of a property bubble and debt crisis.
Instead, Madrid was forced to reduce spending and implement an austerity program -- and that hit living standards.
"The 20% unemployment we now have in Spain is a direct result of the euro," said the economist Cutillas.
Related: Europe's lost generation: Young, educated and unemployed

Cutillas said that many people in Spain, which endured decades of violent dictatorship under Francisco Franco, support the euro because it's associated with progress, modernity and peace. That isn't enough for the economist.
"It's nice to be able to travel around easily and have easy means of payment, but these advantages shouldn't cover what's happening with the euro," he said.

A Greek tragedy
Greece is a prime example of the division between wealthy northern European countries and weaker economies on the continent's periphery.
Facing a debt crisis of its own, Athens agreed to drastic austerity programs in exchange for repeated bailouts. Salaries, pensions and government spending have all been cut dramatically.
Fotis Panagiotopoulos, a dock worker at the Athens Port Authority, experienced the consequences first hand.
His salary has dropped 50% since the beginning of the Greek crisis in 2010. His wife can't find a stable job.
"What we are experiencing in Greece is slow death," he said. "There is no way out unless we break free from this debt cycle."
Panagiotopoulos wants Greece to ditch the euro and start over.
"We just want to make sure that we, and our children, can have a decent future," he said. "With the euro, I don't see how this is possible."

Ireland's 'euro-bubble'
Remember the Celtic Tiger? Ireland boomed in the euro's early years, growing on average 6.5% a year between 1999 and 2007.
Keith Redmond, a dentist and local politician in Dublin, looks back on those days with fear.
"It wasn't a boom. It was a bubble ... a euro-currency bubble," he said.
Redmond argues that without control over its interest rates, Ireland wasn't able to cool the bubble.
When it burst, it brought the Irish banking system to the brink of collapse. Ireland was forced to slash spending.
Ireland has turned the corner and its economy is growing again. But for Redmond, the euro remains a problem.
"The fundamental flaw is still there ... this can all happen again. We have no flexibility in our monetary system to deal with a shock," he said.

French nationalism
Vincent Brousseau is a French economist. But for him, the trouble with the euro is not about the economics.
Instead, he sees the common currency as a threat to France's national sovereignty.
"It's not French," he said of the currency. "It doesn't matter whether it's overvalued or undervalued... this is about making our own decisions."
He's had a major change of heart. Brousseau worked for the European Central Bank until a few years ago.
"When I started at the ECB, I believed there could be one Europe, I was a convinced European," he said.
But he gradually changed his opinion over the 15 years he spent at the central bank that sets a common interest rate for all 19 eurozone countries.
"I realized that transferring sovereignty from France to the European superstate is not good for the country," said Brousseau, who now oversees economic and monetary policy at French political party UPR.

What's next
Opponents of the euro disagree on what should happen next.
Redmond would like to see the currency split into two. The current euro would be used by Germany, Netherlands and other economically stronger countries. A second, weaker euro, would be introduced for Portugal, Italy, Ireland, Greece and Spain.
Brousseau wants France to completely drop the euro and bring back the franc. He's not a fan of the the compromises proposed by Le Pen, who has suggested that a new pan-European currency could be used in parallel to the franc.
In Italy, Bagnai thinks the end of the euro is an inevitability.
"We know that the project could last for a decade, perhaps, but it's going to end. And the sooner it ends the better."

MH370 vanished from radar during a flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing and is believed to have crashed in the Indian Ocean. The Boeing 777's disappearance sparked a search of unprecedented scale, prompting a global debate about consistent standards for aircraft tracking.

"Real-time global aircraft tracking has long been a goal of the aviation community," Malaysia Airlines Chief Operating Officer Capt. Izham Ismail said in the statement. "We are proud to be the first airline to adopt this solution."
The new partnership -- with Aireon, FlightAware and SITAONAIR -- will ensure the airline has access to space-based tracking data for every minute of a flight's journey. The new system is expected to come online next year.
"Malaysia Airlines will know the location, heading, speed and altitude of all aircraft in its fleet, at all times, and be alerted to any exceptions," Paul Gibson of SITAONAIR said in the statement.
Many companies have been jockeying to supply airlines with global tracking systems, including Rockwell Collins (COL) and Inmarsat (IMASF).

The disappearance of Flight 370 remains one of the world's biggest aviation mysteries and its exact crash site has yet to be located.
It's unclear if the new satellite-tracking system would have made a difference, though.
MH370's transponder, which broadcasts the jet's position and identity to air traffic control, stopped communicating while over the Gulf of Thailand. The Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System, also known as ACARS, which transmits small data messages to the airline to a ground network or satellites, also stopped communicating.
The extended inquiry has investigated whether the communications were intentionally switched off by someone aboard the aircraft, but no conclusion has been reached.
Related: Timeline of MH370 disappearance
In the absence of those systems, investigators have had to rely on obscure satellite data to piece together Flight 370's possible path to the southern Indian Ocean.
If flights are tracked with updates every minute, it would make it much easier to locate an aircraft if it crashes in a remote part of the world.
Even with 60 second updates, the precision of a search would be far greater than in the case of MH370.
The International Civil Aviation Organization has mandated that an aircraft must transmit its position once every 15 minutes by November 2018. That will drop to once every minute by 2021 if the aircraft is in distress.
The beverage "is made with a sweet dusting of pink powder, blended into a crème Frappuccino with mango syrup and layered with a pleasantly sour blue drizzle," according to a company release. "It is finished with vanilla whipped cream and a sprinkle of sweet pink and sour blue powder topping."
That's not all. The drink starts out purple with blue swirls and tastes sweet and fruity. But if you stir it then it becomes pink, tangy and tart, Starbucks says.

Today, Cordray and Mel Watt, the director of the FHFA, could only be ousted from their role "for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office." It's rare for presidents to try to remove an official even with for-cause protections.
The bill, called the Financial Choice Act, would also give Congress purview over the CFPB's budget, meaning lawmakers could defund the agency entirely.
Hensarling's bill would do more than simply reshape how Wall Street is regulated. It would also give the president greater authority over a number of the agencies aimed at protecting the U.S. financial system, aiding consumers and slapping fines on wrongdoers.
"Making the CFPB director subject to the whims of the president would be a first of its kind action to centralize banking regulatory power solely in the hands of the president and would eliminate the independence long established by Congress," Gregg Gelzinis, a special assistant for economic policy at the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning think tank, wrote in a report released Wednesday.
And while it's unlikely the Texas Republican's bill would become law as proposed, it will help to shape the new regulatory landscape under President Trump.

Critics say bill would let White House 'micromanage'
Trump has remained steadfast in maintaining his pledge to do a "major elimination of the horrendous" Dodd-Frank regulations. The White House could reshape bank rules through legislation or by appointing top officials who are likely to slash regulation.
Democrats and financial reformers immediately objected to the proposal.
"This latest bill will wind up making regulators weaker than they were before the crisis," Marcus Stanley, executive director of Americans for Financial Reform, a group that fought to protect Obama-era rules told CNNMoney. "It's definitely a shift toward empowering the White House to micromanage consumer protections and enforcement actions."
Policymakers took steps to protect regulators from political pressure and from being heavily influenced by the industries they regulate.
The heads of agencies like the Comptroller of the Currency and the CFPB are nominated by the president, and then confirmed by the Senate. Terms vary based on agency. For example, the chair of the Federal Reserve is nominated for a four-year term. Those agency chiefs don't serve at the pleasure of the president like the Treasury secretary.
Regulatory agencies created by Congress were also designed to be independent. While they must regularly testify before lawmakers, their budgets are typically not subject to congressional approval.
"Congress created agencies to meet two goals of being independent and accountable," said Michael Barr, a law professor at the University of Michigan and a key member of the Obama administration team that drafted Dodd-Frank. "The Financial Choice Act is a move away from independence, and that can lead to significant ramifications." Barr is among several individuals who have submitted briefs supporting the CFPB in a recent federal appeals court case that disputes the constitutionality of Cordray's appointment.

Policymakers must balance oversight and independence
There is a legitimate debate over striking the proper balance between congressional oversight and independence when designing regulatory agencies, Lawrence White, an economics professor at New York University says.
"I don't think there's a clear approach to be favored one way or the other," said White, who was also a former board member of the Federal Home Loan Banks under the Reagan administration.
The Republican bill specifically targets the CFPB, which GOP lawmakers have labeled a "runaway agency." Their chief complaint is that it has consistently exceeded its authority by acting as a "legislator, prosecutor, judge and jury all rolled into one," as Hensarling recently described it.
GOP lawmakers have repeatedly questioned the constitutionality of Cordray's appointment by former President Obama, and have pointed to the fact that his term as director has exceeded the five-year limit envisioned by Congress.
The Republicans' bill would restrict the agency's ability to enforce only existing laws and remove its authority to crack down on "unfair or deceptive acts or practices."
Cordray has said Republican proposals aimed at weakening the CFPB's independence would be a mistake.
"Congress did a good thing in 2010, and it's very important to have an independent watchdog looking out for consumers where it's typically not a fair fight when they're in a struggle with a large financial company," said Cordray during the same hearing in April.

The CFPB isn't the only Republican target
The GOP proposal would bar the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. from overseeing the so-called living will process, which requires banks to write up plans on how they would safely be unwound in the event of a collapse. The FDIC and the Fed are the two regulators responsible for overseeing this requirement under the 2010 law.
The GOP plan would make it easier for Wall Street to overturn regulations. And it would force policymakers to study the benefits of regulations, including Dodd-Frank, versus their costs.
Hensarling's bill would allow banks to run their own stress tests instead of putting the responsibility in the hands of regulators, a requirement that was instituted under Dodd-Frank. It would also revise how often banks would have to undergo a separate stress test by regulators from once every year to two.
